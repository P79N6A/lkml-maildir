several problems associated with it
1. those names are rather meaningless. How do you find out which file they 
refer to? It is OK for trivial cases but not in a directory full of long 
names; nor am I sure how many unique short names can be generated.
2. directory contents is effectively invalidated upon backup and restore (tar 
c; rm -rf; tar x). It is impossible to infer long names from short ones.
3. this still does not answer how can I *create* long name from within Linux.
Currently workaround is to mount with single byte character set, like koi8-r; 
of course it becomes quite awkward if the rest of system is using UTF-8.
