Please use 'z' - and then send it to Linus.
The latest ISO C9x draft (from January 99) specifies:
       z            Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or  X
                    conversion specifier applies to a size_t or the
                    corresponding signed integer type argument;  or
                    that a following n conversion specifier applies
                    to  a  pointer  to  a   signed   integer   type
                    corresponding to size_t argument.
The glibc 2.1 manual has:
`z'
`Z'
     Specifies that the argument is a `size_t'.
     `z' was introduced in ISO C 9x.  `Z' is a GNU extension predating
     this addition and should not be used anymore in new code.
