It is not a win, what if a signal comes in between the two
kernel_default_fd_flags syscalls?  open and other functions
are async signal safe and programs will be certainly upset
if suddenly the syscalls in the signal handler start to behave
differently depending on which exact code the async signal
has interrupted.
