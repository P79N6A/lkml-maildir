I tend to favor not changing the kernel to handle this case.  We're
already making a best effort attempt to handle conflicting directives
from the admin.  This is a policy that can be implemented in userspace
without much trouble.
If we really want to keep the admin shooting himself in the foot,
wouldn't it be preferable to fail the offline operation if there are
user tasks exclusively bound to the cpu?
While we're on the subject, what if there are interrupts bound to the
cpu you want to offline?  Should we consider handling that case
differently as well?
