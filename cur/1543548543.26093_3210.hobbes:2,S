Are you volunteering to do it? No? I thought so.
Personally, I'd rather let Trond spend his precious little spare time on
useful things like improving the code and fixing whatever problems are
left, then have him waste it on such a useless thing. If this means we
have to keep patching each 2.2 release in order to get usable NFS,
so be it.
And, just to make things clear: Alan has *never* said what you imply.
It was Jeff Garzik's suggestion.
