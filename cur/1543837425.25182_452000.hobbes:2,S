Yes, hmm, I don't have another terabyte handy, unfortunately.

How close to 1-1 does "-n" relate to non-"-n" ?
For example, does e2fsck take into consideration the changes it would
have done itself in regular mode when it proceeds to the next problem

If it doesn't, then that command is, well, totally useless.
So :-).  Does it take that into consideration?
