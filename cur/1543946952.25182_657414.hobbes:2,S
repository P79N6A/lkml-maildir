Oh! I did not mean to assume anything. Just wanted to make sure we are talking

From the definition
A Threaded Binary Tree is a binary tree in which every node that does not have a
right child has a THREAD (in actual sense, a link) to its INORDER successor.
You use the empty pointer (missing right child), so why do we need a list. May
be I am missing something.

Yes, that's a bad example I suppose. Look at
