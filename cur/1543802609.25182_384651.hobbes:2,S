Please, I told you before in this thread, don't drop people from the cc
list!
But it does explain that, it says full 1g low memory support. So you
have one full gig of low memory, compared to the default setting.
Describing this in painstakingly more detail it of course possible, but
as the help text mentions, if you are not sure then you better leave
this option at its default setting.
