LSI 1030/1035 U320 (fusion) controllers have simple raid0/raid1 support
Adaptec and LSI still have some u160 or even u320 controllers in the aacraid/
megaraid series afaik, the present the same interface to the OS for parallel
scsi/sata/sas so it's a bit hard to say for me which is the most recent
parallel scsi one.
The old Mylex controllers supported by drivers/block/DAC960.c support up
to u160, and u320 with an IBM-branded controller which probably isn't sold
separately from IBM Equipment and probably not at all anymore.
The IBM i/pSeries integrated RAID supports up to U320 (drivers/scsi/ipr.c),
but you don't get it without an i/pSeries system.
There's Intel Branded, Adaptec manufactured RAID cards that support U160
SCSI, they're supported by drivers/scsi/gdth.c
