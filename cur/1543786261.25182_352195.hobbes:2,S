In the dozens of reports of bad pmd that Fedora users filed, there
wasn't a single EM64T user.  In fact, most of the hits were from
very similar product lines, from a handful of vendors (Tyan's seemed
especially susceptable). It may be that other vendors updated their
BIOS's to include this workaround already, and Tyan and a few others
lagged behind.
