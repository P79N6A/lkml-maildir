I would argue that 'false' and 'true' are values and not constants, but 
further more C99 is defining them in lowercase (stdbool.h).

As I have expressed before, I don't understand why people seem to 
dislike 'false'/'true' but anyway, since you seem to approve booleans, 
would it be possible to convert the obvious variables/functions into 
boolean-type?
