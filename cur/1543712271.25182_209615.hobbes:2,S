On my system it says:
AUTHOR
       Miquel van Smoorenburg, miquels@cistron.nl
There was even patch to do shutdown -z, or something like that... And
binary that calls it should be easy, too.

You are right, that would be ugly. How is encryption supposed to work,
kernel asks you to type in a key?
Okay, when there's more than one output plugin, some kind of file

Okay, we really should have only one implementation.
