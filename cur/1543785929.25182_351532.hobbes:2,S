I'm leaning towards scrappung my Ass motherboard for having a LOT of 
Linux problems. Looking for a recommendation of what to replace it with.
I want something that is highly Linux frendly and "just works".
Running Athlon 64 X2 4400+
Needs 4 SATA ports - prefer SATA II
VGA on MB would be nice but not required.
MUST run with 4 gigs of ram. I have Kingston HyperX which should be 
plenty fast.
I'm running Fedora Core 4 on it.
I'm Running Maxtor drives that support NCQ even though the SATA 
interface is 1.5gb
I don't need raid.
What out there actually works.
