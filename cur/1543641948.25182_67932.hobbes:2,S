   What i am wondering is how come we only get a few percentage
   improvement in throughput
Because he's maxing out the physical medium already.
All the headers for each 1500 byte packet still have to hit the
physical wire, that isn't what is being eliminated.  It's just
what is going over the PCI bus to the card that is being made
smaller.
