I am running into an issue when enabling this flag. Basically, the
timer never fires
when it gets into this situation where in hrtimer_start() the timer
ends up being the
next one to fire. In this mode,  hrtimer_enqueue_reprogram() become a NOP. But
then nobody never inserts the time into any queue. There is a comment that
says "caller site takes care of this". Could you elaborate on this?
Thanks.
