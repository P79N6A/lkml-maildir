Yup, we need page migration for memory hotplug.  However, for hotplug
we are not too concerned about where the pages are migrated to.  Our
primary concern is to move them out of the block/section that we want
to offline.  Suspect this is the same for pages with ECC single bit
failures.  In fact, this is one possible use of the hotplug code.
Notice a failure.  Migrate all pages off the containing DIMM.  Offline
section corresponding to DIMM.  Replace the DIMM.  Online section
corresponding to DIMM.  Of course, your hardware needs to be able to
do this.
