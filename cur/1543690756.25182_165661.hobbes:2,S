Great!  Please push'em.

Eeeh... please re-read my mail.
As stated before you got corruption with hpt366.c because it was calling
hpt3xx_tune_drive() *internally* with pio argument equal to 5 instead of 255.
qd65xx.c is not calling qd*_tune_drive() internally et all -> no possibility
of corruption unless user *manually* sets mode higher than supported.
