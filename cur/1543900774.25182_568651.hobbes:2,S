I agree with you about get().  Allowing NULL argument doesn't really
help anything.  It only increases the chance of getting things wrong.
I'm all for not allowing NULL argument to get().  For put(), as I wrote
before, I think allowing NULL has some advantages and I don't care
either way as long as it's not confusing.  The 'not confusing' part is
way more important to me than advantages of either way.
