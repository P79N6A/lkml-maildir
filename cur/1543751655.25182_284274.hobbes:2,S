Please don't use that for mainline - do_brk_locked doesn;t follow kernel
convention and in addition you've made every case you miss (eg outside
code) fail insecure. The original patch you did that I used that adds
__do_brk() not only follows kernel convention but means anyone with
external code will end up with it fixed or with a deadlock that is easy
to track if unlucky.
Silent security failure is *bad*
