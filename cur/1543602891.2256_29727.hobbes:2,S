Hi,
I hope to be able to use this, but...
I must admit that I'm confused by the terms server, client, and
target.
1.  This is what I first thought:
server = the logging machine, client = machine under test,
and that "target" = client?
2.  Then I was told this:
target == the machine to log to (== logging server)
so I thought that if the target is the server, then the client
must run on the machine under test.  But the client program
won't be started early enough during boot for that to help me.
3.  Then I was told this:
netconsole-client is the server
and
mingo should rename it ;-)
4.  And finally this:
netconsole-client == target
kernel == source
WHOA!  Stop the presses.  Can someone say this more clearly,
and I'd suggest not using 3 names when 2 will do (probably
get rid of "target" and use client/server, or use some
other terminology).
