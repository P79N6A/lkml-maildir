It should be the same as
   echo $((7<<6)) > /sys/module/scsi_mod/parameters/scsi_logging_level
(which indeed is 448) at runtime, right?  (And yes, CONFIG_SCSI_LOGGING
is set to y).
Heh oh those magic numbers!.. ;)
Ok, I've turned on the logging on a bunch of machines (using the sysfs
method), let's see what will happen next.  Thank you!
By the way, should kernel pefrorm at least *some* "minimal" logging of
such a serious events by default?  Well ok, ok, it's not known yet what
the event really is, so I'm shutting up now, at least for a while.. ;)
