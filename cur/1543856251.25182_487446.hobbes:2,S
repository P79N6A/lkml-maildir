in fact it needs to be loaded even before the ACPI engine starts
executing, otherwise you're hot-replacing code underneath a live
system...  at which point you can do this same feature in another way :)
there already is a feature that builds a dsdt into the kernel image, all
a distro would need is a bit of objcopy magic to build the right one
into the vmlinuz...
