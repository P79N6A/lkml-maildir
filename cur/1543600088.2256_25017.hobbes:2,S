looks similiar to problems I had a while back because I didn't 'make 
mrproper'.
try removing FreeS/WAN 1.9.1 and kernel sources, then untar the kernel, do: 
make mrproper 
make xconfig 
make dep clean <bzImage | install> modules modules_install
if this works, then do
make mrproper
add the FreeS/WAN 1.9.1 code
make xconfig 
make dep clean <bzImage | install> modules modules_install
hope this helps
Fred
