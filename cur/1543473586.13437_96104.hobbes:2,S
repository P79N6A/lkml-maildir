Trivial to discover if the system is not completly locked (the keyboard
irq still run).
To discover what is doing the kernel at lockup time you only need to press
ALT-right+SCROLL-LOCK. You must be on the console and not under X. You
will see something like:
EIP: 0010:[<c0107264>] EFLAGS: 00000246
EAX: 0000001f EBX: c01c0000 ECX: c01c0000 EDX: c01ad140
ESI: c01c0000 EDI: c01dc660 EBP: 00009000 DS: 0018 ES: 0018
CR0: 8005003b CR2: 08048dcc CR3: 00101000
If you' ll see this on the console you'll have to write by hand on
paper the number c0107264.
You can get many of these numbers in the same way.
Then you must resolve the numbers throught the System.map of the running
kernel.
