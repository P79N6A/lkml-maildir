Hi,
  I was trying to find, why my SMP box sometime dies without any good
reason to die.
  I finally managed it to print this message instead of hard deadlock:
wait_on_bh, CPU 1:
irq:  1 [1 0]
bh:   1 [1 0]
<[c010a7bd]> <[c018aaa5]> <[c018b58b]> <[c0198313]>
c010a780 = synchronize_bh     c010a7d0 = synchronize_irq
c018a9a0 = do_con_write       c018b018 = console_bh
c018b570 = con_write          c018b59c = con_put_char
c01981bc = opost_block        c0198320 = echo_char
It hapenned on console switch while playing mp3 (it prints very often
to screen).
  Machine is dual SMP PIII/450, 256MB RAM, matrox framebuffer. Kernel is
2.3.18-ac8 (without Ingo's SMP patches).
  Is there anybody who could audit console_bh disable/enable? I tried
couple of ideas, but nothing really helped (i.e. fixed problem, not
symptoms).
                                            Thanks,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
