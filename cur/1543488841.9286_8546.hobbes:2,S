I managed to get what I believe is the real one. I've never seen one like the
one you descrive. is that from a tarball?

I've been happily doing it for a while with -O2 optimisation and
-march=pentiumpro and haven't had a single kernel crash.
I'd use -O6 but I can't find any info on what the hell this does 
as far as optimisation goes.
And is -fomit-frame-pointer a workaround for a bug in some implimentations
of -O2 (I compiled X without it and it's working fine. Hasn't crashed) or
is it something the kernel needs? And, what exactly does this do? I've read
the manpage but what that has doesn't mean much to me. I wish there was
info on not just what an optimisation flag does but also how it might effect
performance and what sideeffects it might have. (this is probably real hard
to do but it would be way useful. I don't mind long compile times as long
as runtime performance is imporved)
