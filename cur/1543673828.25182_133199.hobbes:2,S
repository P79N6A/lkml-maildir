Normally we use start/end for ranges, this is not a range, so I wouldn't
suggest it, but I don't care about names.

that's why I left the BUG_ON, if there's anything else I want to know,
there shouldn't be anything else as the comment also suggest. I recall
when we discussed this single check with Andrew and that was the only
