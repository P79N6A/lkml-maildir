Since you appear to at least be willing to discuss the subject,
perhaps you can answer the question I've asked a number of times
regarding this, that nobody appears to be willing to answer:
 Q> What is so magical about having the CD's boot image being
 Q> a 1440k image when the standard specifies that the boot
 Q> image can also be 2880k in size?
I can confirm that I've checked this out with both the systems I have
access to that can boot off their CD drives, by burning a CD with a
2880k boot image and seeing if they can boot off it. Both booted fine.
However, I realise that a random sample of two computers is not firm
proof that all such systems would be OK, hence my question...
Best wishes from Riley.
