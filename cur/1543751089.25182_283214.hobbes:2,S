FWIW Willy, I did build a couple of the rc's there (coming up on 
2.6.8), now of course entropy has set in and I couldn't prove it, the 
space has been reclaimed, whatever.  My point is that the rc's didn't 
bite me, only the final, and it bit hard.
Again, to TPTB, give us a few days to beat on it in the rc mode, then 
rename whats working to final.  In the meantime, I'm back to beating 
on Ingo's stuff for the moment.
