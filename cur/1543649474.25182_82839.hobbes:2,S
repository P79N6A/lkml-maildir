I have a dual P3 box with 2Gigs RAM booting off onboard scsi, and I am 
unable to get the latest v2.4.19 kernel to support the hardware fully. I 
can get the kernel working if I do not have it configured for 4G support, 
in which case it only sees 900Megs or so of RAM, but everything works and 
boots properly.
When I config for 4Gig however, the system fails to boot, giving a bunch of 
errors like the following:
/lib/ext3.0: unresolved symbol highmem_start_page
/lib/ext3.0: unresolved symbol journal_blocks_per_page_Rsmp_6082191c
/lib/ext3.0: unresolved symbol kmap_high
/lib/ext3.0: unresolved symbol journal_forget_Rsmp_678417a8
...
ERROR: /bin/insmod exited abnormally
I have compiled from scratch multiple times using make menuconfig, from 
freshly untarred sources just downloaded from kernel.org .
All of the system.map and initrd type stuff is setup properly in the boot 
dir by the 2.4.19 make files.
To restate the situation... if I boot from floppy and build the kernel with 
4G support it does not work, then if I reboot from floppy and flip 4G 
support off and rebuild, everything works fine except only 900Megs seen.
I am configuring to boot from onboard scsi (module sym53c8xx) , so maybe it 
is related to that and/or smp support?
Any idea what this means and how I can go about getting this fixed?
Thanks
Ethan
