there is no need or even sense to add such parameter, as irqs are
assigned by the bios or OS for PCI type cards. The driver is supplied
with the selected irq which is normally assigned during boot by the
systems bios.
You should change the bios PCI/Pnp setup to reflect your needs.
I don't know if the Winbond driver supports IRQ-sharing, but other i4l
drivers like the HFC-PCI which I maintain allow irq sharing without any
problems even if 3 cards share it.
So please setup your bios correctly and everything will work fine.
