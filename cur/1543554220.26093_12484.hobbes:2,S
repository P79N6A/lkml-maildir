OK.  Makes sense.  My first kicks at building and running a kernel had
these problems (with module loading) until I added the copying of
System.map to my installation procedure.  I was led to this by
messages in /var/log/messages...  Thanks for the additional pointers.

OK, but I guess my question wasn't very clear.  I have a kernel tree,
I add a printk to maestro.c and make modules.  I cannot load the
module until I rebuild and reinstall everything.  Is there a way to
avoid this headache, or, stated differently:  What's the prescribed
way to be able to load, unload, build, test modules?
