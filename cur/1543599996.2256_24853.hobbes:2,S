Basically you can't hold a spinlock too long or the kernel wil conclude the
other processor has hung. Anything which is going to take a spinlock long
enough to trigger that event is so non-scalable its not funny
It could also be that you have a locking error and are leaving the lock
held in some obscure case - and genuinely deadlocking the box.
