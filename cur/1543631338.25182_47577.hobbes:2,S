I doubt it. the use of do_generic_file_read outside of code the filesystem
has selected to use (i.e. generic methods) is FUNDAMENTALLY broken.
Some time ago I though I found a similar bug in XFS, but Steve Lord says
it's not exploitable in real world (XFS uses the generic methods with
additional locking around it).
The only sane soloution is to get rid of that abuse in khttpd, loop and
sys_sendfile.
