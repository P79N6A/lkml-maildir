This is did not happen before; I am not sure right now what caused this (i.e. 
battery aging or some software change) nor whether this is kernel/HAL/kpowersave 
issue.
kpowersave is stuck at assuming battery is loading and at 94%. Sysfs displays 
battery state as Full:

HAL did not set (dis-)charging either:

Kernel 2.6.24-rc6, HAL 0.5.10, kpowersave 0.7.3.
I suspect this is kpowersave which ignores is_(dis)charging attribute and just 
compares energy_full with energy_now. According to ACPI spec, energy_full 
gives "predicted full charge capacity" - actually it is called Last Full Charge 
Capacity. At least this is what ACPI battery code implements. As such this is 
purely informational and cannot be relied upon for deciding when charging is 
complete. Actually HAL /proc/acpi/battery code did not even use this property.
So
- does ACPI battery code misuse POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_ENERGY_FULL?
- does HAL misuse .../energy_full?
- does kpowersave misuse battery.charge_level.last_full?
