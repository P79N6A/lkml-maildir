Stop the presses:  Another person has now reported back to me.
This guy has the VER_17 chip inside a notebook, and the same problem.
So the unified fix for all of these is to just get rid of rtl8168b_hw_phy_config(),
as that code is all that is really different from 2.6.23 (where all is okay).
Updated patch below.
* * * * *
Fix r8169B regression on ASUS motherboards (and MSI, and..)
Third/final iteration.
This replaces the earlier versions of this patch.
This one fixes *all* versions of r6169 *B* variant,
restoring the init code back to what it was in 2.6.23.
The r8169 ethernet driver worked fine in 2.6.23, but fails
in 2.6.24-rc* for the onboard ethernet of some ASUS (MAC_VER_11)
and MSI (MAC_VER_12) motherboards, and also for some notebooks
(MAC_VER_17) that use this chip.
Various symptoms depending on the .config options:
- the card stops working after some (short) time
- the card does not work at all
- the card disappears (nothing in lspci/dmesg)
A real power-off is needed to recover the card.
This patch fixes it again.
