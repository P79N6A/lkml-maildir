No, there's probably issues there too, but no need to worry about it,
since I already showed that allowing for clocksource_accumulate to happen
inside the get_monotonic_cycles loop is already flawed.

I know you pointed me the code, but lets assume that I'm still ignorant
;-)
do you actually use the RCU internals? or do you just reimplement an RCU
algorithm?
