Andrew,
You're bincancelling messages in linux.kernel, a newsgroup fed by a
mail2news gateway. The gated list is linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org (Cc), a
list to which sometimes binary patches are posted. 
IMHO binaries are acceptable in linux.kernel. Could you consider stopping
bincancels in linux.kernel or even linux.*? Thanks,
