Subject: fcntl F_SETOWN correct?

Here is some code from sys_fcntl() in fs/fcntl.c:
                case F_SETOWN:
                        err = 0;
                        filp->f_owner.pid = arg;
                        filp->f_owner.uid = current->uid;
                        filp->f_owner.euid = current->euid;
                        if (S_ISSOCK (filp->f_dentry->d_inode->i_mode))
                                err = sock_fcntl (filp, F_SETOWN, arg);
                        break;
It looks like no validation is done when setting the 'pid' field.
Is this correct, or should it check to make sure the pid is valid, and
owned by the current user?
