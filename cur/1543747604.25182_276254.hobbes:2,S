The diagnosis is correct, the removing the forced module unload prevents
the recursive page fault from happening.  The HOWEVER, i find it troubling
that it is even possible for the page fault handling code to get page
faults...
The problem is with the 'sonypi' module, which i will document separately.
It was being removed/re-installed to prevent the jog wheel from being
broken after software suspend under X windows.  It currently unloads
without forcing on '2.6.10-rc1' but not '2.6.10-rc2'.  If that is moved
to after the software suspend, then the recursive page fault doesn't
happen (until the next suspend).
