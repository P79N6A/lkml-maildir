Has anyone been able to compile ISC's DHCP client for the 2.1.x or
2.2.0-preX kernels?  Whenever I attempt it, I get a lot of errors about
undefined items (BPF_LD, BPF_H, etc.).  I've tried adding a #include for
filter.h from the kernel sources (2.1.131 and 2.2.0-pre6), which seems
to be where the referenced symbols are defined - no luck so far.
Needless to say, any suggestions would be appreciated.
All of the systems at work are using Olicom token-ring cards, which
don't seem to want to work properly with dhcpcd (even with the
token-ring patch), so that doesn't appear to be an option.  ISC's client
works fine with the 2.0.x kernels, but the 2.0.x-compiled version
segfaults if I try to run it under the 2.[12].X kernels.
Sorry if this has come up before, but I just haven't been able to find
a working solution...
Thanx!
