System.map has nothing, repeat nothing to do with depmod at startup.
Yes, you can run depmod reading from a System.map but that only makes
sense before you boot the new kernel.  Once you have booted your
new kernel, depmod -a reads from kernel memory, not System.map.

Current Makefiles sometimes break with module versioning, the design is
inherently wrong but rewriting the entire Makefile system just before
the release of Linux 2.4 is not an option.  This should be in the FAQ,
Richard, please add.
Q.  Why do I get unresolved symbols like foo__ver_foo in modules?
A.  If /proc/ksyms or the output from depmod -ae contains symbols like
    "foo__ver_foo" then you have been bitten by the broken Makefile
    code for symbol versioning.  The only safe way to recover is save
    your config, delete everything, restore the config and recompile.
     mv .config ..
     make mrproper
     mv ../.config .
     make oldconfig
     make dep clean bzImage modules
     install, boot
