Use vga=866 to set 1280x800 in boot time.
In Documentation/fb/vesafb.txt is commented only 1280x1024, but in same 
man page is commented that you can read /Documentation/svga.txt and in 
this document you can find this:
** Short intro for the impatient: Just use vga=ask for the first time,
** enter `scan' on the video mode prompt, pick the mode you want to use,
** remember its mode ID (the four-digit hexadecimal number) and then
** set the vga parameter to this number (converted to decimal first).
