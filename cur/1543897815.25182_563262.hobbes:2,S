You have a point.
But:
Code in the kernel must fulfill some (not completely fixed) quality 
criteria. It wouldn't be good to blindly include every bit of GPL'ed 
kernel code available anywhere in the Internet.
As an example, it's highly unlikely that some external device driver 
will be accepted without the author/maintainer doing some changes for 
getting it included.
If [1] AppArmor is considered to be generally insecure or in all 
respects inferior to SELinux it doesn't belong into the kernel.
Being blessed with some of the holy penguin pee by being included in the 
kernel is considered by many users as a quality criteria.
Sure, this contradicts a bit the "get your code upstream" mantra, but 
these are two conflicting goals and there's therefore no ideal solution.
If [1] AppArmor is offering required functionality not available through 
SELinux and it's considered a correct and secure solution for these 
purposes it should go into the kernel. Otherwise, it should not go into 
the kernel.
