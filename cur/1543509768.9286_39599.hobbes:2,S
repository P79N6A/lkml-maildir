Hi all,
I just booted Alan's 2.2.13pre9.
(pppd v2.3.5
 Kppp v1.6.2 KDE desktop dialer)
Trying to log on to my ISP, Kppp told me something like 'You do not
have ppp in your kernel, not even as a module. Go away!'
This is wrong. (It is the same configuration as for 2.2.12, which
works without
problems.)
This message does not come up after I do the following silly thing:
(don't ask me why I did it)
-start pppd on a root console
-kill pppd from another root console (since the first one is
unresponsive and full of garbage, of course)
After this, strangely, everything works fine ever after.
I have not tried other dial in procedures and I know that my pppd and
Kppp are not the latest/greatest.
Does the little change from 2.2.12 to 2.2.13pre9 in ppp.c (see below)
explain this behaviour?
