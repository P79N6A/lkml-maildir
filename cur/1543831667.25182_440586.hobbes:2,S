No. That's was rejected due to the
"don't give people semi-automatic weapons to shoot their feet off with" principle.
The problem with patches like this, and the "let cpufreq overclock" patches,
and the "let me input my own voltage/freq pairs via sysfs" patches
is some lucky soul (yours truly) gets to deal with the fallout when peoples
computers crash after trying patches like this.   My inbox has more than enough
problems for me to dig into, without introducing more problems that are
frankly, undebuggable.
