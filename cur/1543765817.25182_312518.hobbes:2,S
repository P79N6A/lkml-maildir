This is utterly absurd. You can find out anything thats in /proc/cpuinfo
by calling cpuid instructions yourself.
Please enlighten me as to what security gains we achieve
by not allowing users to see this ?
Restricting lots of the other files are equally absurd.
I'd also be very surprised if various random bits of userspace
broke subtley due to this nonsense.
