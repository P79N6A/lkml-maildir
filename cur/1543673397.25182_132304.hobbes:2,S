This would also happen with the encrypted swap solution since it
replaces swapon.
Wouldn't it happen on upgrades even if you put it all in the kernel, since
the stock redhat kernel would have it off by default ?  (It will be
off by default because most people won't need this feature and it'll have
a performance penalty) ?
I guess when you maintain a non-default system you must have some
post-upgrade procedure.  I know I do.
