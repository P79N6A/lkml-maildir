There's not a lot of docs out there.
The man-page:  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-bisect.html
Linus's email doc:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/howto/isolate-bugs-with-bisect.txt
I worked on something over last weekend, but it doesn't really add
much to the references above.

Did you tell git where to begin with good and bad?  I.e., you have
to tell it the bracketing of where to do the binary search.
