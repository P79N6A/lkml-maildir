Hugh,
If I am reading you correctly, you are saying that mlock currently
prevents pages from migrating around to unfragment memory, but
get_user_pages does not prevent this? If this is the case, this could
very easily be the problem Timur was experiencing. He is using
get_user_pages to lock pages long term (for the life of the process,
beyond the bounds of a single system call).
If it is possible for a page to be migrated in physical memory during
extreme virtual memory pressure while the reference count is held with
get_user_pages, that would cause the problem where the hardware is no
longer mapped to the same page as the application.
BTW: In earlier kernels, I experienced the same issues in our IB
drivers when trying to pin pages using only get_user_pages.
