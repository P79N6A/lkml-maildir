Do whatever you want.  Its your life.  Laugh at people, mock
people, rant, rave, violtate licenses, wantever you want.
When you are done making noise, please explain how a closed
source binary only product that runs within the context of the
Linux kernel is not a derivitive work, per the very definition
given in the kernel COPYING file that grants you your limited
rights for copying, distribution and modification,
