The thing is, the non-ide-scsi interfaces really _should_ work. The fact
is, SG_IO ("send a SCSI command") just _works_.
However, right now only the CD-ROM driver exposes those commands. Why? 
Because nobody has apparently cared enough about those theoretical IDE 
tapes and ZIP drives.
In other words, they seem to "exist" in the same sense that soubdblaster 
CD-ROM users "exist". True in theory, but apparently only really useful 
for theoretical arguments.
Getting SCSI command support is not complicated: you add
	ret = scsi_cmd_ioctl(dev, cmd, arg);
to your ioctl routine. Of course, since so far nobody seems to have cared 
about anything but CD writing, it's not really tested for anything else.
