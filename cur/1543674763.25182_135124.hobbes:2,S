Hello all,
it did not take really long for rc3+aic20030520 to freeze - exactly one day.
Though I used nmi_watchdog there are no presentable outputs. As I expected the
screen simply is black and no messages are in any logfiles.
Again it froze while tar-ing about 80 GB of data onto an aic-driven SDLT. Data
is coming from IDE drive connected to a 3ware 7500-8 (though no raid
configuration). 
I conclude that rc2+aic20030502 was way better.
Ah yes, one more thing: I can ping the box, but keyboard, mouse, display is
dead and usually working processes stopped (like snmp).
Willy: I am willing to try a serial console setup (as it does not interfere
with X). I have tried this before with no luck. Can you provide some hints how
you got that working (yes, I read Documentation/serial-console.txt, but I could
not manage any output on the serial line).
Regards,
Stephan
