On this side of the pond, many words lose their diacritical marks
after lots of usage.  "Cooperate" has previously been hyphenated
(co-operate) or spelled with a diaeresis over the second 'o'.
They are now lost.  So we can thank teletypes for that?
or laziness?  could be.
Anyway, "Role" looks good to me.
