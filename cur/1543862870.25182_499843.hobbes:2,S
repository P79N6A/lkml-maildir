Thanks very much Grant for the test. Could you try a symlink to a file ?
And while we're at it, would you like to try to add "|S_IFLNK" to
mnt->dir_mode ? If my suggestion was stupid, at least let's test it to
full extent ;-)
I had another idea looking at the code but since I really don't know it,
I would not like to propose random changes till this magically works. I'd
wait for Dann who understood the code.
Best regards,
Willy
