Depends on if it is a noMMU or MMU platform.
Since noMMU platforms can't re-arrange non-contiguous blocks (which appears in 
a read/write ext2 file system) we need to use a read only romfs which 
applications are guaranteed to be contiguous by design.
I don't think the noMMU case is documented in xip.txt
