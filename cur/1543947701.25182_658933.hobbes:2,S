Yes, I would like to expand them.  If possibly, I'd like to take out
the individual config options for gcc flags and integrate them into
the help description.  I feel that the redundancy would not only be
ugly, but possibly confusing.

I hadn't thought of that.  It would certainly be more useful than a
stern warning.  ^^;  Have you any ideas on how to implement such a
thing?  I would imagine a configure-script-like test on the flags to
make sure that gcc could take them correctly would be in order.  Then
one could also capture any warnings or errors that gcc outputs (such
as redundant flags, improper invocation, etc.), fail the build, and
output the messages.  As far as capturing dangerous flags for the
kernel (such as -ffast-math or -fmerge-all-constants), there could be
a blacklist... but that would depend on the gcc version used... :/
Perhaps the automated catching of errors and warnings would be best
alone.

I believe you misunderstand.  I mean to include the link in the help
message.  Like how the links to the appropriate sites for device
drivers are included in their help messages.

No, I feel that both adjectives are perfectly reconcilable, at least
in this case.  Again, more documentation couldn't hurt.  "Dumbing
down" kernel configuration may be less aesthetically pleasing to
purists, but that is a tiny price to pay for usability and a widening
of kernel builders.

Safe experimentation, yes.  So I agree with you that adding various
statements in the help message can only do good.  Sorry for the
confusion.

PS to Nick:  Sorry for the double-send. Didn't CC lkml;  a forward
would be ugly.
