through using the userspace helper he is able to use existing maintained
libaries, something that isn't possible with kernelspace suspend. This
is real code reduction.

Why (when LZF would be useful for other stuff) nobody proposed inclusion
of it?

While reading this 'discussion' I get the expression that swsusp isn't
working. But this isn't true: it works for me since I can't remember
when. The only problems were with some modules (ieee1394 had to be
unloaded before suspending) and minor glinches (writing the image
sometimes _very_ slow when suspending from a powersave cpufreq
governor..).

swsusp works for me (TM), no problems at all, siree

so submit driver specific patches through the driver's maintainer? Where
does Pavel enter the picture?

code dupplication?

Maybe the mentioned problems with bitmaps and the module infrastructure
could explain that. Even Nigel said that the problem with evolutionary
patches is that suspend2 changes some fundamentals.

Are you really threatening Pavel's position as maintainer? how subtle.

andy, a long time swsusp user.

it seems like "Van Jacobson's network channels" [0] would move some
stuff to userspace. Are you volunteering? (dislaimer: I have just
glimpsed at the article).
