Thanks, Andi - that was indeed the problem.  Of course, things like
this are never solved until asked about on a mailing list :)
HIGHMEM4G rather than HIGHMEM64G (not sure why I had that marked),
no PAE, and I was using the 64-bit memory/IO (EXPERIMENTAL).  Now it's
off.  A side effect was CONFIG_X86_CMPXCHG64 disappearing from the
.config, which I thought might have also been part of the problem
based on that other thread.
Either way, thanks for the response!
