I'm sorry. "module inserting" is LINKING. A kernel module does, in my
oppinion, NOT fall under the gpl stated "mere aggregation" boundary of the
GPL, it is compiled with kernel headers, contains kernel _code_ from these
headers etc etc, and is for all intents and purposes part of the GPL program
"kernel" once loaded. It uses normal function calls etc etc, symbols are
resolved using normal linking mechanisms etc etc.
