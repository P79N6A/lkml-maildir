Bit addressing is strictly internal to the cpu, the smallest unit that
the cpu can address externally is a byte.  The only place where bit
order matters on the C level is in a bitfield that is overlayed over a
block of memory, but this is not visible outside the cpu.

The bit mapping on your device is strictly internal to the device and
has nothing to do with bit order on the C level.
