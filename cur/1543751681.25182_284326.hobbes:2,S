You've already proven that soft RT does not suit your requirements. The 
current scheduler running a task at nice -20 has extremely long periods 
of cpu availability at the expense of lower priority tasks and is close 
to the behaviour you would get with a soft RT patch. Your concern is 
exactly the scenario where nice -20 fails, and would be the same 
scenario where a soft RT policy would fail. Doing this with a scheduling 
policy, you want cpu time long after there is any hope for fairness or 
safety of hanging. From experimentation with such soft RT policies, we 
find average latencies can be reduced but the maximum ones, which are 
the ones that concern professional audio, remain the same.
