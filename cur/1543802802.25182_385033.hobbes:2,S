I agree with Adrian on this point.  The
kernel-list patch reviewing process only depends on "diff -pu"
format, and git obviously gives its users an easy way to
generate such, but so would other tools.
The number of patches on the kernel list that are coming from
git does not really matter, but even if it did, they seem to be
a very small minority.
This is SubmittingPatches document that is being discussed, not
LinusPleasePull document.  The latter would naturally _require_
the developer to use git, but not the former.
