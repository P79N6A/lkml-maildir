Not publicly, no.  If akpm or Linus asks, I will happily encourage
either of them to try to win him back.

I committed to Linux way back when it was obscure compared to BSD..... 
and I like the way the GPL allows me to make some small amount of money
selling licenses in addition to the GPL, and the way MS can't reuse my
code for free without attribution.

I didn't say V3 should be pulled out, I said marked as deprecated.   And
left alone so that it gets only bug fixes and not new features.

Uh, no, it ran all the DOS applications better than DOS did.  Seriously,
it did.  I remember DOS applications that were easier to make work under
OS/2 due to 640k something or another.  I pray the memory of exactly
what does not return to me.;-)

Of course they count.  I don't expect any users to convert from V3 to V4
on an existing OS installation until we have a robustly working
convertfs, and even then most of them won't.  Please note the phrase
"new installs", it was very intentional.

I fully expect that there will be people using V3 long past the time
when better filesystems are available and working and stable, the world
has a lot of lag time to it.;-)
