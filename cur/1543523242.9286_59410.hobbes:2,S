I have been experiencing this at least since 2.3.34 on a dual Celeron
500MHz box with Abit BP6 MB.
The other day, when I tried to build Mozilla running 2.3.41pre1 it
succeded (it has been failing every time followed by fs corrution).
So I went on using the kernel thinking that it might be working now.
But when I unpacked a rahter large tarball while doing a few other things
at the same time, the result was not good. Some of the files from the
tarball had Input/Output errors and fsck had to be run manually to fix it.

I guess it's SMP specific.
