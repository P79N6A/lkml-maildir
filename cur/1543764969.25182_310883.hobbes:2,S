Seems to have crashed, we don't know the cause yet.  Is there anyone who is
dependent on this tonight?  If so I'll drive down and fix it (yeah, very lame
of us, we moved it to a different rack which was too far away from our remote
power so I can't power cycle it remotely.  Our bad.)
Let me know, if I don't hear from anyone we'll get it in about 14 hours.  If
that's too long I'll understand, it's 20 minutes away and I can go deal.
