Andrea suggested that this might be a mlock bug and someone else
pointed out that madvise instead of mlock exhibits similar behaviour.
So I looked at this code and this patch looks obviously correct:

        right->vm_raend = 0;
        if (vma->vm_file)
This assignment is redundant and it is not protected by any locks.
As far as I can see vma->vm_mm->page_table_lock is supposed to protect
modifications of vma->vm_flags. If this is true we probably need this
as well:

I doubt that this is the reason for the google memory problems, but
who knows?
