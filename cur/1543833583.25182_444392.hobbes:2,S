Aaah - so you don't want to store this on the fs.  So this is actually

I see.
That's also what I was imagining earlier, but it seems crass somehow.
I'd almost prefer to just tag a mount with a user namespace implicitly,
and only allow the mounter to say 'do' or 'don't' allow this to be read
by users in another namespace.  Then in the 'don't' case, user joe
[1000] can't read files belonging to user jack [1000] in another
namespace.  It's stricter, but clean.
But whether we do mapping tables or simple isolation, I do still like
the idea of pursuing the use of the keystore for global uids.
thanks,
