With CONFIG_PREEMPT upstream, that's exactly the same (unless
you're considering preempt breaking points, which you don't
seem t obe).

There is no specific inviting of preemption. The locks are
preemptible -- they can be preempted even while being *held*

A driver shouldn't get to decide that, IMO. And if there is
some policy in the -rt tree allowing these decisions, then
it's exactly the kind of thing we don't want upsream.
