I did a binary chop on the value to find the cut off point between what works 
and what doesn't.  Its approx 535ns (534 failed, 537 worked).
All this was with 2.6.9, 
2.6.10-rc2 is still failing during the cd initialisation on boot.  Here I 
tried with bot 600ns and 700ns delays in drive_is_ready, but both values fail 
with what looks like missed interrupts.  I'll try instrumenting this a bit 
more to find out what is happening.
