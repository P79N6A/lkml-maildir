I previously mentioned that "pci=routeirq" works to fix my 8139too
problems. However, I just figured out that if I use "acpi=noirq" or
"pci=noacpi" instead of "pci=routeirq", that works too. (This is with
2.6.10-bk4.)

I don't think this is a case of broken drivers. So far in this thread, it's
been seen with e100, 8139too, snd-intel8x0, and probably one of the USB
drivers too. And the problem happens even if the module is unloaded and
reloaded -- unless I'm seriously missing something, this probably means
pci_enable_device() is unable to do its job properly for some reason --
but only after a swsusp resume.
It would also be informative to examine the kernel command line options
that are making the problem go away:
pci=routeirq
acpi=off
acpi=noirq
pci=noacpi
What do they all have in common? ACPI. (AFAICT from my reading of the
source code, on i386 pci=routeirq only has an effect if ACPI is being
used for IRQ routing.)
So, I think this bug probably lies in ACPI or swsusp. I highly *highly*
doubt it's driver bugs. Hopefully I'll have time later tonight or
tomorrow morning to see if I can figure anything else out...
