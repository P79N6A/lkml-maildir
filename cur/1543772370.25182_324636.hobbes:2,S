Ask Ingo. I'm through with this track and your misinformed comments
about it. We just went through a 300+ plus thread discussing the issues
and you still apparently haven't read through the relevant portions of
it.

How are they more reliable ? explain that to me ?

When you demonstrate a basic understanding of real time programming and
ask a relevant and informed question, then I'll be very happy to explain
this patch, single kernel RT design issues. Until then, I'm declaring
that I'm officially sick of reply to FUD generating comments from folks
that don't understand how this patch works.
