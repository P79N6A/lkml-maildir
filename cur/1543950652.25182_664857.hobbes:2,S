It's been a long day, and I couldn't get addr2line to work, it kept saying '??:0'.
However, this is in my System.map:
ffffffff8020a000 t poll_idle
ffffffff8020a009 t do_nothing
ffffffff8020a00f T set_personality_64bit
ffffffff8020a041 T release_thread
ffffffff8020a07d T arch_randomize_brk
so set_personality_64bit+0x14 or so?
