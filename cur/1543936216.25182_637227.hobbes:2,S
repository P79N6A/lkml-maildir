A query on locks used to protect entropy_store
struct entropy_store {
	/* mostly-read data: */
	struct poolinfo *poolinfo;
	__u32 *pool;
	const char *name;
	int limit;
	struct entropy_store *pull;
	/* read-write data: */
	spinlock_t lock ____cacheline_aligned_in_smp;
	unsigned add_ptr;
	int entropy_count;
	int input_rotate;
};
Is this lock meant to protect all the data within the structure?
The lock is being taken whenever entropy_count is modified, but it is
not so when it is read, see random_poll(), random_read(). Either it
should be lock protected or made as atomic_t, right?
Also the globals random_read_wakeup_thresh and
random_write_wakeup_thresh are not at all protected by any locks! Why
locks are not needed for these?
Sorry, if that was a stupid question.
Thanks
