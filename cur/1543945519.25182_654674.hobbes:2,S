I am doing this in xpmem with a stack-based structure in the function
calling get_user_pages.  That structure describes the start and
end address of the range we are doing the get_user_pages on.  If an
invalidate_range_begin comes in while we are off to the kernel doing
the get_user_pages, the invalidate_range_begin marks that structure
indicating an invalidate came in.  When the get_user_pages gets the
structures relocked, it checks that flag (really a generation counter)
and if it is set, retries the get_user_pages.  After 3 retries, it
returns -EAGAIN and the fault is started over from the remote side.
Thanks,
