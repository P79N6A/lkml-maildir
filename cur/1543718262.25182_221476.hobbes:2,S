I received a report from James H. Cloos Jr. (cc'ed to the rest of you),
but apparently, that report never made it to linux-kernel (I haven't
seen it it the archives or in my lmkl file).  His report was regarding
similar file corruption on xfs.
<OT for this thread>
I also made a report yesterday regarding a compile problem with
lib/kobject.c and no CONFIG_SYSFS.  That post also never made it
to the list. If that happens again, I'll report it to the right folks.

Actually, it was a Mandrake kernel, 2.6.3-4mdk IIRC.  Whatever is
the default with MDK 10.  One salient difference with the vendor
kernel is that everything which can be a module is, and I wasn't
using any modules with my kernels.  BTW, I was careful to have the
same hdparm settings during the performance testing.
The performance difference was very repeatable.  Using the script
provided by Andy Isaacson, the 2.6.3-4mdk did the clone in about
11 minutes total, while the various current kernels took about
15 minutes total.  The user times were the same, and the difference
was in system time.  Those numbers are from memory, the actual
results should be in the archive.

I may be able to do some some performance testing here at work,
where I have a greater variety (and much faster) machines to use.
