There have been two alternatives for me:
        1) static/passive interface i.e. the /proc/filecache querier
           - user-land tools request to dump the cache contents on demand
        2) dynamic/active interface i.e. the readpage() logger
           - user-land daemon accepts live page access/io activities

Good insights.
The readpage() activities logging idea has been appealing for me.
We might even go further to log mark_page_accessed() calls for more
information.
This approach is more precise, and provides process/page
correlations and time info that the /proc/filecache interface cannot
provide. Though it involves more complexity and overhead(for me they
mean the possibility of being rejected:).
