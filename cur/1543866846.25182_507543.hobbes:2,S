Hi , thanks for reply , I will send them again, and this time I will check 
that mailer doesn't mess with patches.
I fixed word wrap problem.
I also want to note that my address is now maximlevitsky@gmail.com , the 
address I took recently because yahoo is only aviable via webmail
and it is not good for patches.
Thanks for reply, 
regards , Maxim Levitsky
