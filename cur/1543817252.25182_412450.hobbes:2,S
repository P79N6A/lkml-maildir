I would view the latter as a disadvantage, since I can't think of a case
in which you wouldn't want it reported as an error instead, at least if
you care about performance.  If you know of one, I'd be very interested.
The first form does have the advantage that it's possible to build up
more complicated primitives from simpler ones without repeating the
definition four times.
I'm not sure there's a clear winner here.
In the C++ case, I currently expect we will go with template arguments,
which are guaranteed to be static, but are an option you don't have ...
