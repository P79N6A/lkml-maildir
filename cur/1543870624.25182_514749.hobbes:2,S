That's an academic exercise, or are you talking about some real world

clockevents is based on the monotonic system clock and depends on the
accuracy of that and the device which deliveres the interrupts.

There is nothing to nugde. The clockevent subsystem operates on absolute
time, so there is no cummulative error, except you setup your timers
relative per event.
