	I don't know if this is related or not...but thought I would report
it.  System 2xPIII, 1, then 2 SCSI HD's.
	I've been running off of one SCSI disk on the 2.2.14 kernel for
a while now -- no problem.  Yesturday I mounted a 2nd SCSI hard to do 
builds on.  I was remotely logged in.  I loaded it up with a large project
and did a make. Then I remotely logged in on another window.  It just
hung there.  Tried a third window.  It hung too.  So of course both
of the login attempts would be accessing sda -- the make was accessing
sdb.  Finally logged in after long wait -- tried a 'vi' on a file on
sdb in one window and a 'top' in the other -- both hung.  Tried to kill
the make -- that wouldn't work -- just ignored me -- finally suspened and
issued kill -- that took forever.  Went to console and screen was in
power save off -- at first unresponsive.  Then it turned on the screen
to a 'frozen' screen saver (Matrix).  Machine was still pingable, but
login attempts would time out.  Ping times were down in the .2 range, but
occasionally there would be a ping time of over 1400ms, followed by a 
2nd at 200+ms, then back to .2.  Had to power-cycle machine to reboot.
Lots of messed up files in /var + /tmp (sda) and on my build disk (sdb).
So there were lots of outstanding writes that were needing completion.
Had to manually fsck 2 of the partitions (/var + /tmp) -- when it came back
up I looked at the log -- the last thing before the reboot was:
