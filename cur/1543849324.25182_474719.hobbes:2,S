Can't we just move flush_cache_mm to below the copy_page_range, before
the flush_tlb_mm?

If the cache is dirty, then the TLB must have a writeable mapping in it,
mustn't it? If there is an architecture where this isn't the case, then
the current code is broken anyway, because in your example the T2 thread
is dirtying data right before the mapping gets write protected anyway.
