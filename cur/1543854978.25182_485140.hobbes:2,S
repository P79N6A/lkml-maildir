I did first attempt to make them inline functions, that leads us to some
new dependancies such as on MAX_DMA_ADDRESS.  I must admit to backing
off at that point, the dependancy problems between mmzone.h and mm.h
caused huge amounts of problems for me in the past and I was shy of
playng with them again.
I'll take a look see if thats the only one or if it is indeed still
endemic.  I know some of the issues were fixed with additional headers.
