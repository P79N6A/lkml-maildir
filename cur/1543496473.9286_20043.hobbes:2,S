The problem being: we need to treat the target name differently from all
other contexts. Normally foO *is* Foo. In case of rename() target we
should consider Foo as name of non-existent file. And protect ourselves
from races with creat() and mkdir() that might see the negative dentry and
jump on it.
Please, wait till the next week - I got a large piece of sh^Htuff on my
head (real life ;-/) and I'm effectively off-line till Monday. I have code
doing the thing and I've mostly separated it from the dcache rewrite
(which is *not* stable enough). I will post it for testing on Monday or
Tuesday.
