Aw, and you are such a good tutor, too.  :-)  But thanks - my particular
goal isn't to fix apache since there is already a group of folks working
on that, but as we look at kernel traces, this should give us a good
idea if we are at the bottleneck of the apache architecture or if we
have other kernel bottlenecks.  At the moment, the latter seems to be
true, and I think we have some good data from Troy and Dave to validate
that.  I think we have already seen the affinity problem or at least
talked about it as that was somewhat visible and Apache 2.0 does seem
to have some solutions for helping with that.  And when the kernel does
the best it can with Apache's architecture, we have more data to convince
them to fix the architecture problems.
thanks again!
