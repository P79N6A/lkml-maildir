As a rule, I put all of the reported regressions into the Bugzilla early.  You
are not required to use these entries for tracking the bugs, though.  If you
don't want to, just leave the entry as is and I'll close it when the fix is in
the Linus' tree.

Well, I thought you'd get an email from the Bugzilla, but of course I can notify
you directly about reported regressions related to IDE.

I can do that, but please note that the bugs filed against IDE are assigned to
you automatically, so I'll have to reassign them to me (as I've just done with
this particular entry).  If you don't want them to be assigned to you at all,
please contact the Bugzilla administrators and ask them to change that.
Thanks,
Rafael
