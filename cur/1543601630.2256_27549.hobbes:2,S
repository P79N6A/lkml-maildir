Again :
1)      select()/poll();
2)      recv()/send();
vs :
1)      if (recv()/send() == FAIL)
2)              ioctl(EP_POLL);
When there's no data/tx buffer full these will result in 2 syscalls while
if data is available/tx buffer ok the first method will result in 2 syscalls
while the second will never call the ioctl(). 
It looks very linear to me, with select()/poll() you're asking for a state while
with /dev/epoll you're asking for a state change.
