You get your own subdirectory to play in, so there really isn't much you
can do to hurt the namespace :)
That being said, stay away from files named "device", "driver", and
"dev".  They are used by the driver core (well, "dev" isn't, but each
class provides it...).
Just remember, one value per file and everyone will be happy.
