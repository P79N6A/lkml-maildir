	VFAT has a nasty bug in rename() and I see no other way to fix it.
Suppose we are doing rename("/mnt/LongDirName","/mnt/bar") and pwd of
some process being /mnt/longdi~1. We'll either have the alias alive after
the rename (hashed, under the old name, etc.) or we'll get a process with
unhashed pwd. We've been through the latter variant already. Easily
results in dentry leak. Former variant is outright BS - 
mv LongDirName foo; cd longdi~1; shouldn't succeed. Current code unhashes
all aliases of source. Right thing for files, exploitable for directories.
Notice that moving aliases does no good - target may have none.
	We could return -EBUSY if the source has busy aliases, but IMO
it's extremely bogus, even for bandaid.
	I've done the change of ->lookup() type per se, but didn't finish 
VFAT part yet. I'll be done with it tomorrow. Then - testing...
