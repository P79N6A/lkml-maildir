When you say "All RAM memory checks turn out just fine" do you mean
the BIOS memory checks or something else?
For a proper memory test run memtest86 (
http://www.memtest86.com/
)
and/or memtest86+ (
http://www.memtest.org/
) overnight (some 8-12hours
or more) with all tests enabled.. If the machine survives without
errors that then you can be reasonably sure memory is OK... The BIOS
tests are more or less worthless.
