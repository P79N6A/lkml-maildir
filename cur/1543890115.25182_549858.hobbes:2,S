At least on my device (PCI ID 1131:7162) there is no MSI-X capability,
so that's not an option for you.  The current Linux implementation
does not support more than one MSI interrupt, so you just get one
interrupt with pci_enable_msi().
I think it's probably simplest for you to forget about MSI until you
have the basic driver working.

All this is device-specific stuff ... not sure how much anyone can
help you if you can't share the docs.
