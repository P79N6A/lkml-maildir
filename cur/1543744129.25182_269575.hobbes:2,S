No. glibc uses 256 of them.
To make life interesting they use names
"pqrstuvwxyzabcde"/"0123456789abcdef"
while BSD used
"pqrsPQRS"/"0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv"
and the first ENOENT terminates the search, so old BSD programs
might see only 16 ptys.
I would be inclined to remove the variable CONFIG_LEGACY_PTY_COUNT,
using 256. If one really wants to use CONFIG_LEGACY_PTYS, that is
the right number. So, in include/linux/tty.h:
- #define NR_PTYS CONFIG_LEGACY_PTY_COUNT
+ #define NR_PTYS 256
