Jeff,
Logical end-of-tape handling is clearly defined in Exabyte's SCSI reference
manual which you can download from their web page. There's nothing fatal
about it, your application should handle it. The SCSI Write command that
reaches logical end-of-tape (or end-of-partition) will end with a Check
condition, Sense key 0h, ASC=00h, ASCQ=00h, EOM bit = 1. Your data will be
written to tape just fine. There is plenty of tape left so you can
gracefully write a delimiting filemark or whatever you need to close the
current data set. All write commands after reaching LEOT will also result in
a Check Condition with the above sense information (until you really run out
of tape). It's a Logical end-of-tape you deal with, not a Physical one.
As a side note, make sure you have the latest firmware loaded in your M2
drives.
