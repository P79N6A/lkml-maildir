The patch is probably ok.
Both the current code and the new code are "wrong" as they assume
something about the setting of d_op, which only the filesystem could
know.
The current code assumes it will always be NULL.
The new code assumes it will be uniform within the filesystem.
Neither of these are certain to be true, but the later covers all
filesystems that the former covers and more, so it is safer.
It is not tecnically necessary as any filesystem in free to define
their fh_to_dentry operation to return a dentry that was not
DCACHE_NFSD_DISCONNECTED, and then this code would never be called.
The easiest way to write a fh_to_dentry that did this would be to copy
slabs of code out of nfsd/nfsfh.c, but there might be GPL issues if
Veritas did that.
All this is handled quite differently in 2.6 so it isn't an issue
there.
I would say "accept the patch".  I might even submit it for 2.4.23...
