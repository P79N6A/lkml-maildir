Are you sure ? Why ? Till there no warning we can not check it.

You can not :-)) It'll be slow, error-prone and will have security iplications
(why ? think about symlinks :-)

POSIX IPC implementation needed finename, visible from userspace. If you
have no knowleadge about where "IPC filesystem" is mounted you can not
construct such name. With //ipc //ipc/bla-bla-bla will be ALWAYS
//ipc/bla-bla-bla -- no matter what and when. The same goes for //proc and
so on. Of course we can always say: if you are mounting procfs not in /proc
and ipcfs not in /ipc then blame yourself. But then why it should be done
from userspace if there are no choice ?

Then we'll end up with kludges like devpts handling in glibc :-((
