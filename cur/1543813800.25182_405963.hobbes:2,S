I would be happy to extend swap prefetch's capabilities to improve resume. It 
wouldn't be too hard to add a special post_resume_swap_prefetch() which 
aggressively prefetches for a while. Excuse my ignorance, though, as I know 
little about swsusp. Are there pages still on swap space after a resume 
cycle?
