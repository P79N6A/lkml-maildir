   What is required for preempt beyond "SMP safe" code? I thought the whole
   idea was to make the preemptions transparent to other code by utilizing
   the SMP critical regions?
Pre-empt makes things like per-cpu data structures require
preemption disables around cpu-local critical regions.
Code that works before just because it knows the data structure is
only even accessed by the current cpu doesn't work because preemption
can cause a context switch at any time.
