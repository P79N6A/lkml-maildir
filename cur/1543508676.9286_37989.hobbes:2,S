This is more of an FYI than anything as it has probably always been
broken. At least from reading the SANE list it appears scanning with a
BusLogic card (BT-930, BT-950, and BT-958) on an SMP machine causes
random but frequent lockups. One person's machine would crash any time
he touched a non-Hard Drive device attached to the controller.
The solution thus far has been to just buy a new SCSI card...  I'm going
to toy with the driver to see if I can figure out what is going on but
my device driver coding is extremely limited. Chances are my BT-958 will
be forsale on ebay shortly :)
