Sure. And why don't you also do
	#define sin(x) (1)
	#define sqrt(x) (1)
	#define strlen(x) (1)
	...
to make other benchmarks happier?
bonnie is a _benchmark_. It's meant for finding bad performance. Changing
it to make it work better when performance is bad is _pointless_. You've
now made the whole point of bonnie go away.

It's a common problem with bad programming.
You can be thread-safe without sucking dead baby donkeys through a straw.
I already mentioned two possible ways to fix it so that you have locking
when you need to, and no locking when you don't.
