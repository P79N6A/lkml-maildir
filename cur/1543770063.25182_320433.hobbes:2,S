Any stability risk in PREEMPT is a stability risk in SMP.
I've been looking at some form of this RT code for over a year now. 
And 99 % of failures is buggy / dirty code that 
could fail under SMP as well, if not worse. 
We've pushed all that back to Ingo 
and elsewhere.
And the bugs keep on coming. This is the fast-track to exposing
concurrency problems all over the place, which makes better code
in Linux.
The RT stuff has the potential to enhance SMP scalability.

Linear is maybe not a good term to use. Do you mean the order in which
IRQs execute, or just that you execute IRQ code in process context.
A good generic IRQ handler that can run on multiple architectures,
doesn't care what the CPU flags are.
If it does have to be so down and dirty, it probably doesn't run 
as a thread, and its likely SA, as well.
If its about the order in which pending IRQs are processed, then lets take
a leap and ask why does that matter. The IRQs shouldn't care less what 
order they are processed in, if they are truly asynchronous / sporadic.
After all, how would the system know which IRQ arrived first to begin with,
when you happen to enable IRQs somewhere, and there happen to be 3 IRQs pending?

Except complexity, as the performance differential between the
Linux kernel and the nanokernel vanishes.
