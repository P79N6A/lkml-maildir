I would disagree.. the kernel is enforcing the permissions specified 
where the CPU architecture allows it. There is no sense in breaking this 
everywhere just because we can't always enforce it. By that logic we 
should be making PROT_READ imply PROT_EXEC because not all CPUs can 
enforce them separately, which makes no sense at all.

That makes little sense to me.. if you want portability, and you're 
reading from the file, you better request PROT_READ. Any app that 
doesn't do that is inherently broken and non-portable regardless of what 
you do to the kernel.
