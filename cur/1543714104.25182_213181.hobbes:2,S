Subject: DRM bk tree moved to bkbits.net
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/4/10/96

The drm-2.6 tree is now hosted on bkbits.net,
http://drm.bkbits.net/drm-2.6
I'll remove the server from freedesktop.org now...
And just in case anyone is wondering, DRM development will still go on in
the CVS tree at freedesktop.org, this tree is only a place to sync with
the Linux kernel and so patches go both ways..
Dave.
