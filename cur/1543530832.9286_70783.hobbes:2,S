	No, "port" 65535 refers to a packet fragment.  The general
recommendation for a packet filtering firewall is to turn on "Always
Defragment" when you compile your kernel so your firewall never has to try
to inspect fragmented packets.
	Please direct further firewall questions to the ip-masq or
ipchains mailing lists - see 
http://ipmasq.cjb.net
 for more info and
pointers to both.
	Cheers,
	- Bill
