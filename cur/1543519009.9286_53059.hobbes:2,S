Hmm ? Why ? Bash was developed long before linux was invented. And it was
used in places where 8bit was used for special purposes mostly. Now times
are changed but old defaults are still there.

Bash is part of GNU system, NOT linux system. It was adopted by Linux but
it's used on A LOT OF different systems including 7 bit terminals.

Unix, parts of GNU (including bash) are using 7bit terminals RIGHT NOW in
A LOT OF places. Just since you are using bash on PC does not mean it's the
only place where bash is used. And bash DOES NOT limit you to 7 bits. It's
just default -- you can change it easily if you need to.
