Can you reproduce it with other ftp client and/or server?
Anyway...
Please provide the output of "netstat -na" command during the
transfer, and the output of "lsmod | grep conntrack" (just for
sure).
More questions:
What kind of mode do you use? e.g. PORT/EPRT/LPRT/PASV/EPSV/LPSV
When the transfer get stuck, are other communication still working?
Are there any workaround?
e.g. stop-start vsftpd cycle, ifdown-ifup cycle, rmmod/insmod cycle etc.
