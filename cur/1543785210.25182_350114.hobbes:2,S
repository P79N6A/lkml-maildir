Al, I understand that we can't set ->permission to NULL as it removes the 
chroot boundary check. If I understood you correctly, we need to put 
additional checks in proc_permission to ensure anyone doing ls 
/proc/<pid>/task won't be able to see other threads.
Coming back to the problem of being able to see the threads of a process 
whose main thread has done pthread_exit, it appears to me that the only 
hurdle is getting the ->fs pointer from task struct. Since all threads of 
the process point to the same fs structure, would it be okay if we try to 
get it from some other thread? Below is the patch I tried for this:
