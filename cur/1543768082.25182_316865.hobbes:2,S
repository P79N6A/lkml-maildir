i havent reviewed them closely, but on the face of it the changes seem 
plausible.
What would be nice to achieve are [low-cost] reductions of the size of 
struct rt_mutex (in include/linux/rt_lock.h), upon which all other 
PI-aware locking objects are based. Right now it's 9 words, of which 
struct plist is 5 words. Would be nice to trim this to 8 words - which 
would give a nice round size of 32 bytes on 32-bit.
