We are pleased to announce the 2.6.23-rc9-rt2 tree, which can be
downloaded from the new location:
 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/
Changes since 2.6.23-rc9-rt1
  - x86_64 disable IST for debug (Andi Kleen)
  - Better handling of dynticks going bad in RCU (Steven Rostedt)
  - Preempt RCU boosting (Steven Rostedt based on Paul E. McKenney's 
    stuff)
Again, this still holds experimental code. But I've been running it on a
few boxes already (and even the box I'm writing this on). 
to build a 2.6.23-rc9-rt2 tree, the following patches should be applied:
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.22.tar.bz2
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.23-rc9.bz2
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/patch-2.6.23-rc9-rt2.bz2
The broken out patches are also available.
