It is hard to add support for VIA VT6420 PATA channel (SATA works fine)? 
Does anybody working on it? I can help with beta testing this driver. 
(The way through via82cxxx.c don't working.)
Is it possible add to To-do list to sata_via.c or add this support to 
driver?
sata_via.c:
---cut here---
   To-do list:
   * VT6420 PATA support <= new line
   * VT6421 PATA support
