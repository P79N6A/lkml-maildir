Is this really necessary in modern gcc versions, such as 2.95 and
thereafter?
Snip 2.3.x arch/i386/Makefile:
# prevent gcc from keeping the stack 16 byte aligned
CFLAGS += $(shell if $(CC) -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -S -o /dev/null
-xc /dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2";
fi)
