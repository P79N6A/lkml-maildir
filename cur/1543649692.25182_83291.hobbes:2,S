Hi,
Wouldn't it make sense that somewhere in kernel/fork.c:dup_task_struct we 
copy the resource limits as follows.
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < RLIM_NLIMITS; i++)
		tsk->rlim[i].rlim_cur =
			tsk->rlim[i].rlim_max =
			orig->rlim[i].rlim_cur;
This way a parent process is able to temporary drop some of its limits in 
order to make a restricted child process and restore its resource limits 
afterwards. Currenly it is not possible to make a child process with 
smaller resource limits than the parent process without the parent process 
losing its (hard) max limits (As far as I know, correct me if I'm wrong). 
I could very much use this to control core dumping of child processes in 
a better way. Of course I don't know to what extent this will break 
things. POSIX???...couldn't find anything on it.
Please CC me.
Frank.
