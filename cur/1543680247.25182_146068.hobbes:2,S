I'm no expert on the mount --bind stuff, but as far
as I understand it, this is simple (I guess Al Viro 
would agree *g*) VFS magic, so what happens seems to
be the following:
 - a new vfsmount entry is created by either
   copying the old tree or cloning the original
   mount (if it is a mountpoint)
 - the required dentries are added to the dcache
so the number of --bind mounts from another mount
point will be roughly limited by the number of
vfsmount structures possible, and the space available
to cache/store dentries ...
I guess there will be some tradeoff when the number
of --bind mounts becomes very high, but I guess it
is neglectible for normal use ...
I might be totaly wrong, so do not rely on it 8-)
HTH,
