The web interface seems to be at fault (or is it your fingers ;)
  from my saved mail with Linus and yourself I have...

The patch you actually include seems to be a combination of
     ChangeSet 1.373.204.73 2002/05/28 22:01:57 torvalds@home.transmeta.com
       Remove re-use of "struct mm_struct" at execve() time.
       This will eventually allow us to copy argc/argv without
       any intermediate storage (removing current argument size
       limitations).
and
     ChangeSet 1.373.221.1 2002/05/28 22:55:46 torvalds@home.transmeta.com
       Allocate new mm_struct for execve() early, so that we have
       access to it by the time we start copying arguments.
