Subject: [GIT PATCH] PCI bugfixes for 2.6.12-rc4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/5/17/215

Here are 6 patches for the 2.6.12-rc4 tree that fix some PCI and PCI
Hotplug bugs.  They also delete a lot of code that is no longer needed
from the pci hotplug core.  There are also two patches in here that make
it easier for userspace to autoload modules for PCI devices.  All of
these patches have been in the past few -mm releases.
Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/pci-2.6.git/
Full patches will be sent to the linux-usb-devel and linux-pci mailing
lists, if anyone wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
