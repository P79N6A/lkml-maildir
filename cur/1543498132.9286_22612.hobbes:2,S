syscall_trace is in the fast path?!?  It only gets called when a process
is being traced, and nobody expects traced processes to run extremely
fast, do they?
The problem isn't that the child thread is traced, it's that the `clone'
call itself from `kernel_thread' is traced.  So one would have to clear
the flag and then reset it in the parent.
Besides, this doesn't suffice.  There are other places in the kernel
that make system calls (there's a `waitpid' in `request_module' for
instance).  We would need to find and change all of these and institute
a rule for the future, or else change the inline asm definitions in
asm/unistd.h.  Either seems a lot more complex.
Am I missing something?
