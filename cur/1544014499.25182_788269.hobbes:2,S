nfs threads is a real good example.  I missed that.  I will play
around with nfs threads and try to optimise the condition.

Tweaking the sched domain parameters affect the default power saving
heuristics anyway.  Protecting against the flags alone will not help.
Your point is valid, I will think about this scenario and see how we
can protect the behavior.

Changing flags through this interface is complete low level control.
End users who want to tweak individual sched domain parameters are
either experimenting or optimising for their specific workload.
The defaults should generally across common workloads.  Users can
further tweak this low level settings.  We can clearly document the
relations so that we know what to expect.
sched_mc=2 depends on NEWIDLE but the wakeup biasing part will be
enabled even without this flag.  The power savings will be marginally
better than sched_mc=1 without NEWIDLE.  But the end user can have
that setup if they want to.
You have pointed out a scenario where users can turn off NEWIDLE and
still expect to use sched_mc=2.  The scenario is valid and the user
should be allowed to do so.
