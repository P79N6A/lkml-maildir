I'm afraid that that doesn't work for usb mass-storage devices.
Here is what I did:
1) kill hal
2) insert usb stick -> led lights
3):
echo -n 1 >    /sys/bus/usb/devices/.../power/autosuspend
echo -n auto > /sys/bus/usb/devices/.../power/level
4) wait
Nothing happens, where as sending "suspend" to power/level does turn the led 
off. Now call me naive, but I would expect a mass-storage devices with no 
partitions mounted to autosuspend when autosuspend is enabled for that device.
And yes I'm pretty sure nothing else is talking to the device.
As usual keep please me CC-ed as I'm not on the list.
Regards,
Hans
