   Here is a little patchlet which adds to the new documentation for
   CONFIG_INET_ECN in Configure.help.  This patch applies to
   2.4.0-test11-pre3.
This is really superfluous.
ip-sysctl.txt documents this fully, and lists it as a BOOLEAN
sysctl, this should be enough to show folks how to turn the
thing on and off.
So such instruction doesn't belong in Configure.Help
Later,
