anybody know about IBM deskstar? I lost a couple of mail folders yesterday
mysteriously (size became -1 as reported by stat, and number of blocks allocated
was 0). I have unmaskirq and write-cache turned on. Problem here, maybe?
Though IBM guarantees that at most one sector will be lost with write-cache even
if the system plain loses power.
Also, an fsck reported nothing wrong with the filesys (ext2) (and yes, I did do -f).
