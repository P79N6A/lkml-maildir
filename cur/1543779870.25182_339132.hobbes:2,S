Not on Opteron, but probably on Intel.
iirc popf will actually flush parts of the trace cache, while
a branch shouldn't do that. So I expect it to be a win.

If we have iopl and TF elsewhere then the flags could just be replaced
with a default value. 
Drawback would be that it would be slightly incompatible to before,
but then it's just a function call and function calls are not 
required to preserve flags.

They do pushf.

Are you sure? I thought it was expensive on Northwood at least.
Haven't measured on a Prescott or newer.
