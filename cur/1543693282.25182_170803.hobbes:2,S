So with these patches we actually eat up more LowFree if all sysfs
entries are searched, and make the dentry_cache bigger?  That's not good :(
Remember, every kobject that's created will cause a call to
/sbin/hotplug which will cause udev to walk the sysfs tree to get the
information for that kobject.  So I don't see any savings in these
patches, do you?
thanks,
