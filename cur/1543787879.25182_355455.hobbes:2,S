Subject: ati xpress200: clock too fast => no_timer_check not working

hi,
i've been trying to get this working the last days but to no success.
i'm currently testing with kernel 2.6.13.2 vanilla. laptop is an acer
ferrari 4005 with amd turion 64 cpu, ati xpress 200 chipset with some
buggy acpi bios.
according to other reports regarding this chipset, the kernel option
"no_timer_check" should help against the clock is running too fast bug,
but it isn't here.
i've tried many combinations of the parameters: noacpi, noapic,
noapictimer, no_timer_check, lapic, irqpoll
the clock runs fine ONLY with the parameter "noapictimer irqpoll". but
then, the system won't work properly at all, e.g. will hang on reboot,
without irqpoll the kernel spits out many error messages during boot
time (that look like stack traces) and disables some IRQs.
i have no idea why "no_timer_check" isn't working here - are there any
kernel settings that have an influence on this? i tried the options
regarding hpet timer and the like, but it doesn't seem to make a
difference.
i also have the problem, that cryptsetup-luks (i have my whole root
encrypted) won't accept my passphrase on a high resolution framebuffer.
i think that is related to the clock issue, because the cursor blinks
*very* fast when cryptsetup is asking for the passphrase.
it works with standard vga resolution though..
the output of lspci -vvv, dmesg and the kernel config is attached.
any ideas how to get this beast working?
thanks very much!
