Please Ingo, stop repeating false argument without taking in account people's
corrections :

I am sorry to have to repeat myself, but this is not true for heavy loads.

From an earlier email from Tim bird :
"I still think that this is off-topic for the patch posted.  I think we
should debate the implementation of tracepoints/markers when someone posts a
patch for some.  I think it's rather scurrilous to complain about
code NOT submitted.  Ingo has even mis-characterized the not-submitted
instrumentation patch, by saying it has 350 tracepoints when it has no
such thing.  I counted 58 for one architecture (with only 8 being
arch-specific)."
