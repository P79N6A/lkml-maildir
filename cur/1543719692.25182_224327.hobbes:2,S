But also b calls f calls g...
Maintaining the full possible-call-graph is a _huge_ job, better done
automatically (because somebody _will_screw up when doing it by hand). Plus
the fun "structure spicked with all sorts of function pointers" object
implementation in the kernel... note that your carefully maintained call
graph/counts can be screwed up royally by any random third-party device
driver or filesystem module.
