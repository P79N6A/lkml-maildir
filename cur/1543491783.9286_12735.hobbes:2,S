Along those lines we should also have:
GNU/FreeBSD
GNU/OpenBSD
GNU/BSD/OS
etc etc etc..
Come on now.  Even if richard put alot of work into this, most of this

have contributed to GNU and not started another free license (BSD
license?), if they knew that in X time RMS would be arguing for putting
GNU on every OS using a GNU tool.
