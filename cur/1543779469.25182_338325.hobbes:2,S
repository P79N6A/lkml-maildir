Well, I thought I understood "from the stone age" but I may have taken 
it slightly too literally. But I really would like to have more control 
over Linux memory use, because it does cause bad behaviour at times. If 
I have 4GB of RAM, I'd like to set 200MB or so aside for programs, and 
never page out the window I'm going to uncover later. Likewise when I 
write a DVD image, I would like to avoid buffering a few GB without i/o 
and then driving the disk totally busy while it gets written out (after 
it has pushed out things I will use again).
The old 2.4.x-aa kernels had some tunables to make the kernel aggressive 
about writing pages to disk quickly, and I haven't been able to match 
that behaviour without patches in 2.6. I may be missing a tunable, but 
swappiness doesn't seem to be the one I want. I have a patch I'm playing 
with, but it's not ready for prime time, and is probably counter to the 
current philosophy of memory management.
Thanks for clarifying.
