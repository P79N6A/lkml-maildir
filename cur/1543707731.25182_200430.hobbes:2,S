I relooked into manual (see promise site support, user manual)  and 
there are two parameters for TX4 : write through/ write back , cache on 
cache off..... I don't know which cache is it about but I'll redo some 
test (argh you oblige me to reboot to windows! did you thought of my 
uptime! LOL )this evening but as far as I remember the optimal values 
where write through /no cache.....
on windows with cache on their was small hangs too....
I noticed then that a prempible kernel is not a good idea in my case : 
lot more "small hangs"......
