One of the worst parts of prune_icache was that if a journaled
FS needed to log dirty inodes, kswapd would wait on the log, who was
probably waiting on kswapd.  Thus the dirty_inode call, which I'd like to
get rid of.
I don't think kupdate or bdflush are suitable to flush the dirty inodes,
kupdate shouldn't do memory pressure and bdflush shouldn't wait on the log.
So how about a new kinoded?
