I do not *want* to be the most popular maintainer. That is your place ;-).

Ugh?
Lee is a programmer. He wants faster swsusp, and improving uswsusp is
currently best way to get that. It may be alpha/beta quality, but
someone has to start testing, and Lee should be good for that (played
with realtime kernels etc...). Actually it is in good enough state
that I'd like non-programmers to test it, too.
And yes, I'm a maintainer, and that means I have to reject bad
patches from time to time, too.
