Hi,
   I have a P6 SMP box and I'm using Linux 2.2.3 SMP kernel. But I
   can't power it off automatically with APM, but only displayed
   "Power down."  Yes, I added "apm=smp-power-off" to boot time kernel
   parameter, -p option to halt. And I know that some patch is there
   but not applied to Linus kernel. Why not? He doesn't remember it?
   Regards,
        A.Yoshiyama <yosshy@debian.or.jp>
