Much bigger problems are:
- Who will maintain this information properly?
- What about modules that are maintained implicitely by the subsystem
  maintainer?
And often a user can't be expected to locate the source of a problem, or 
it might not be in a driver but in a subsystem.
For vendor kernels, the user should contact the vendor.
For ftp.kernel.org kernels, I don't see any better solution than telling 
people to report problems to linux-kernel or the kernel Bugzilla and 
routing them further from here.
