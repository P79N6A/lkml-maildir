Just so people are aware, I am still seeing kswapd runaways (99% cpu
usage for a number of hours, causing other processes to go into tight
loops as well) with this kernel version (whether or not swap exists)
when updatedb runs in the mornings.  The machine exports both Samba
and NFS shares, and the kernel is configured for high memory (4GB), so
the conditions are similar to the previous examples of this behaviour.
I remember that someone at some point had an alternative VM
implementation that was supposed to correct this problem.  Does anyone
know who that was and if there are any patches that would apply
against 2.4.21-rc1?
