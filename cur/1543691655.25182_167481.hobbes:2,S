The problem is that nothing comes for free. The hotplug capability you
have now comes at the cost of utter nonconfigurability, that is - it
gets input from every pointing devices.
The bright-future solution is to have GPM and XFree configured at
runtime by the /sbin/hotplug agent to open/close devices as they come
and go.
This again comes at a cost - more complex setup - but one that is
completely configurable as to which device goes where, stable in regard
of plug-in order, etc.

We could. Don't do a 'cat /dev/input/event0' if event0 is your keyboard
then, though. ;)
We also could change the EVIOCGRAB semantics to only grab in respect to
the handler, not just the single handle ...
But I still hope we'll be able to get to the /sbin/hotplug solution
without having to create too many intermediate solutions.
