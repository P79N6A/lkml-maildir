Great, I was hoping you'd do that!

That's horrible 8(  I think we need figure out why this is happening:
do you know?  What does it actually need?
Ahh, I just came across the same problem!  See my
ordered-core-initcalls patch, for bio.c changes: you probably need to
change this too (and I deleted the redundany explicit IDE inits).

Icky, but that's what my follow-on patch for explicit initcalls is
for.  So raid is an example where it doesn't have an implicit
dependency, but it does have an actual dependency.

Hmmm... Good idea, at least for the moment.  Eventually we won't have
any bugs 8)
I've updated my explicit core initcalls patch on top of your new one,
thanks!

It reverts your module initcall change, and boots here.
Cheers!
Rusty.
