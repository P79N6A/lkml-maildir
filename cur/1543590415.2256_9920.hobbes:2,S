Which is exactly why I think it is an  IRQ routing table bug. It is wired
to IRQ 10 and claims to be on IRQ 11.
There are two things at work here
	PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE - random gunge for the OS
	PCI_INTERRUPT_PIN - INTA/INTB/INTC/INTD wiring
The tables are then described by the $PIRQ table in the BIOS. We use that to
load the mapping registers in the PCI bridge (and also to read them). If the
tables are wrong then we will mismap interrupt INTA-D lines to IRQ lines.
IRQ11 appearing on IRQ10 sounds exactly like the INTA-D line setting for IRQ
11 is wrong and we connected it to IRQ 10
