How much does this contribute? I guess the _truly_ i[34]86 dependent code
is a few hundred lines, if that much. Besides, you would probably be

Just too bad that 2 out of my 4 machines at home are ISA only, this one is
ISA/PCI; and of the servers at work a lowly P/155 (just ISA) is doing
useful work as the connection point for modems.

Try it, and come back with patches.
