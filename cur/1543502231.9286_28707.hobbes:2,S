Nope.  Wouldn't work because some options are dependant on other
options, and that would change the size.  Also, the kernel is
available on many architectures, and the byte size of code is
totally different on other architectures due to native word size,
alignment, and the fact that RISC, and VLIW machines use TONNES
of memory by keeping instruction length static.
It also depends on what compiler is used, and what options are
given to that compiler.  The phase of the moon, and the square
root of the amount of disk space at NASA also have something to
do with it.
