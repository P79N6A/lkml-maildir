People who run VMS systems become all too familiar with the
characteristics of extent mapping.  Files-11 tends to cause
slowly-expanding files to wind up with lots of short extents if the
filesystem is nearing capacity.  There's a healthy market for
defragmentation products in this space.  No doubt this was one of the
things that prompted the development of Spiralog.

A Brazil-nut is neatly packaged and tightly integrated.  To turn it into
food, you must crack and remove the shell.  I find that I feel the same   
way about an increasing number of software products.  *sigh*
