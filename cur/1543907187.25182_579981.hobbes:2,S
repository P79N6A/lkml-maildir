We don't want to be adding horrible hacks and slowness to the core of
__alloc_pages().
So where do we stand on this?  We made a mess of NUMA policies, and merging
"grouping pages by mobility" would fix that mess, only we're not sure that
we want to merge those and it's too late for 2.6.23 anwyay?
If correct, I would suggest merging the horrible hack for .23 then taking
it out when we merge "grouping pages by mobility".  But what if we don't do
that merge?
