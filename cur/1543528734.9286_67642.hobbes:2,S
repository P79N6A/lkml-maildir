Yes, it does.

Excuse me? Why? We have an object - pwd. Lookup goes from that object.
_That_ should not be changed by any mount. Notice that if you had it
opened before mount() readdir() on it would return its contents.
Look: step of lookup ends with the step upwards. It's 3-d structure, not
2-d one. You are getting exactly what you ask for - "." is "do the step
with zero horizontal part". E.g. "go upwards". Which is no-op for
everything except the mountpoints. Your problem being?
