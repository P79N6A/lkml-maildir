It should be followed in stable releases. (and usually is - except for few
cases - and except that there is no specification, just unwritten rules).

Why should block device developers read TCP/IP code? And only after
reading significant amount of it they realize that they can be called in
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE state. 
They will most likely read other block drivers, find using schedule
without setting state and use it also that way. 
The only way to tell developers to always set state before using schedule
is to write it to specification.
