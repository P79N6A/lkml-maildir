Hmm: "locked by one of the devices": do you mean a DMA transfer for
example?  These are initiated by the host, but proceed asynchronously,
so I'm not sure I'd describe it as being locked "by the device" as
such.  At any rate, the IDE code has to remember that the cable is
asynchronously active until DMA ends...  (Or I suppose it could just
check the hwif BMDMA bits for the active state.)
I don't think you're actually disagreeing with me here btw; if you are
then I've obviously missed your point ;-))
