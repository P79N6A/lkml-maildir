Yeah, that's the diff.  (thud is a starvation testcase posted a while back)

(tiny slices make for much context switching, but [alone] doesn't help low 
prio tasks get cpu)

(this will increase cpu multiplexing drastically, but will also make the 
desktop feel any background load pretty much instantly.  btdt too, ok for 
very light load, but bad for balls-to-the-wall throughput here)

Thanks.  I don't have evolution on my linux box (pine/vi/procmail 
rules).  ImageMagic ought to give X more than enough spurts of frenetic 
activity though.  Do you have that, and does image manipulation make xmms 
stutter as well?  Just moving windows around and changing backgrounds 
doesn't do anything here.  (500mhz piii/128mb ram btw)

<g> I can make it do a skip so big that SysRq-E or BRB are the only 
recovery options.
