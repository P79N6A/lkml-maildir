Why not?
Can't we just "know" if specific chipsets implement posted
mmconfig writes or not?
Intel folks have confirmed their chipsets to date implement
non-postable mmconfig writes.

hrm...are you suggesting another entry point in the struct raw_pci_ops?
There are two tests in arch/i386/pci/mmconfig.c:pci_mmcfg_init() before
the raw_pci_ops is set to &pci_mmcfg. Perhaps some additional crude tests
could select a different set of pci_raw_ops to deal with posted writes
to mmconfig space. Someone more familiar with those chipsets might
find a more elegant solution.

Uhm, ACPI needs to tell the firmware?
I would expect firmware to be platform/chip specific and "just know".
If you meant OS, we already embed knowledge about specific chipsets
for bug workarounds (e.g. tg3 driver). I think that's an option here too.
I mean tweaking mmconfig.c to install a (possibly) chip specific
method (raw_pci_ops) to flush posted mmconfig writes.

Yeah, I would expect it to also. But I certainly don't expect
it to know how to flush a posted write with anything but a
config read.
If the chipset that implemented posted mmconfig writes is compliant
with the ECN we've been talking about, then there must be some other
method to guarantee the writes reaches the device. I would expect
another raw_pci_ops method to be able to deal with it but can't
promise that's true for every chipset out there.
