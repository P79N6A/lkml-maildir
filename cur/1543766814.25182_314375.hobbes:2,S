Just as a weird idea, spawned by the FUSE thread.
"Transactions happen in their own namespace".
Besides having a namespace_(create|join) as needed for FUSE (or
similar), there'd be a privileged namespace_replace(target, source) (or
_merge, if you prefer - that however seems to imply that a namespace was
actually forked off another).
So, you want transactions for testing some software update, you create
your new one, mount stuff, do the update, and then "commit" it by
replacing the global namespace by it.
If you want to discard, just exit it. As soon as no further references
to a namespace exist, it can be cleaned up (and non-persistent
transactions will be 'unrolled' and thrown away).
Now where's that pipe of mine... ;-)
