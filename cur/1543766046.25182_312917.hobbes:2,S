Tom,
I was not able to duplicate this problem on my system yet for I have
trouble in getting my system booted up on 2.6.12-rc2-mm3.  I did some
back-tracking and found that the boot problem occurred also with 
2.6.12-rc2-mm2 & 2.6.12-rc2-mm3, and on two systems using IDE as boot 
drive. The config file I used worked fine on 2.6.11.7. I tried 
different config file without success.
The errors I encountered were:
Reading all physical volumes.  This may take a while...
Umount /sys failed: 16
mount: error 6 mounting ext3
mount: error 2 mounting none
Switching to new root
Switchroot: mount failed 22
umount /initrd/dev failed: 2
I also encountered issue you & others discussed in the thread on
"Re: Heads up on 2.6.12-rc1 and later" if I used SCSI drive.
Can you send me the config file you used successfully on your 
system?
Thanks,
Dely
