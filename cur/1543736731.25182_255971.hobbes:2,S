Herbert,
Honestly, I dont see much difference makes if the swapon procedure
is called from within the kernel instead from userspace.
Have you actually tried such a "on demand swapon" entirely
from userspace to call it "half-assed" solution ? :)
The act of killing tasks is controversial and always generates
debates here. I bet we will continue seeing them over
the years.
If one dont want the OOM killing to happen, he should correctly setup the 
swap size for his workload (or have a "on demand swapon" solution which 
can be implemented in userspace), or unset overcommit mode. 
There's not much to argue about that.
One controversial issue is the OOM killer policy, which is
hardcoded into the kernel - through the last years there have
been several attempts to make it selectable (which this "oom_pardon" 
patch is about). 
None of these attempts have made into the mainline kernel, because there
hasn't been an agreement on what is the best implementation 
of such feature - each implementation is specific to one user 
group need (for example "dont kill tasks named bla" or "dont kill
tasks from UID bla" or, or).
But other than the OOM killer policy selection or tuning there's not much
to be argued really.
