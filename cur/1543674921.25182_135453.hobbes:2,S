probably I didn't explained correctly but it's not really a matter of
optimizations, it's a matter of "kernel crashing gcc produced asm". I
don't expect gcc to generate kernel crashing code from the above, no
matter if the ram at virtual address 0x320 changes or not. But of course
I expect gcc to optimize the above and to cache the result of *a and to
read from 0x320 only once. Regardless it won't kernel-crash, that's the
bit that matters to me.
to clarify further what is the stuff that we've to care about: if you
wrote this instead of the above:
	int* a = 0x320;
	switch(*a) {
	case 0:
		xx(a);
		break;
	case 1:
		yy(a);
		break;
	default:
		zz(a);
		break;
	}
then you should definitely put a volatile before "int * a" or the kernel
could crash randomly while excuting the above if the ram at address
0x320 can change under gcc (despite both xx,yy,zz would all be robust
internally to whatever value a could have, and xx,yy,zz could even take
a spinlock internally before re-reading a, still the kernel could crash).
Of course the suggestion made from the gcc developers would make it
impossible to run into the kernel crashing asm, because they would
always ask us to define stuff as volatile. We don't obey to that rule so
we must imagine how gcc could ever compile the gcc code _every_ time we
deal with non volatile marked memory that can change under gcc (i.e.
outside locks).
At the moment it seems the only potential kernel crashing optimization
in gcc is while dealing with switch, but it wasn't clear if there could
be more.
