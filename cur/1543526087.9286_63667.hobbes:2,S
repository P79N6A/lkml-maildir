Perhaps it's a feature. In any case, the driver should not die there
no matter what. It does have a timeout, but it's currently set at two
hours, which might be a bit too long...
Try changing:
#define IDETAPE_DSC_MA_TIMEOUT          2*60*60*HZ      /* 2 hours */
in drivers/block/ide-tape.c to 30 or 15 minutes, and check if the
driver recovers from it in your case (it should recover, but it has
been a long while since I last tested the timeout mechanism).
I don't know what's the best value for this timeout; there are some
tape drives which search for the end of media or filemarks linearly
and aren't smart enough to optimize it. 2 hours is probably a bit
too much, though.
