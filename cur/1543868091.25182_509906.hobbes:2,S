Allrighy,
Since somebody up there hates me and passed me a cool fever with a
body temperature of 39C I'll stay in bed, of course.
But I wouldnt be me if I would be stopped by some inferior fever this weekend.
So I am going to install my HP Pavilion dv8373 laptop with Linux.
Two SATA disks connected to a ICH7, Nvidia 256MB video card, mmc card
reader, bluetooth, firewire and a remote control.
Anything you guys and girls know of what I can face during installation?
Patrick
