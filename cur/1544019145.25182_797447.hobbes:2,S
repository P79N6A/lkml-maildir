Right. I agree. However over time a number of us in the pro-audio area
have thought about using the GPU for things like building complex
reverb convolutions in real-time. Lots of parallelism in the math.
These machines are not typically very graphically intensive and the
VRAM on the cards isn't required but it's there. Somehow being able to
get data in and out of the VRAM using standard file commands, letting
something like GEM do the work, and then getting the data back seems
appealing.
I hope Jonathan keeps up the efforts. Interesting stuff.
