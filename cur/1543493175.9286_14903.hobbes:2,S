Indeed. It was just a minimal recommendation against just silently trying
to clear the offending bits. I didn't encourage to let the driver blindly
attach the device and tamper the address as a memory mapped address.
I obviously assumed this not to happen if the last read of the bits
returned wrong values.

If this window does not conflict and no driver will tamper the window and
the chip hasn't exploded at the time this bit 0 has been set, then nothing
bad should happen when attempting to clear this bit 0, in my opinion. :-)
