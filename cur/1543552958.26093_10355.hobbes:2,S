it's waiting for TCP output packets to be processed. This is a TCP
protocol detail and is not connected to VM issues. The function name might
be a bit misleading, it could be 'tcp_write_possible()', or
'tcp_wmem_free()'.

as far as i understand, this can happen if another host (for whatever
reason) does not process the TCP output packets this host has sent.

we do not keep the lock for the entire loop, we schedule away on line 882
with the socket lock dropped. This is a pretty standard (and safe) locking
technique.

well, thats the point of the socket lock - we can access socket data
structures almost only via the socket lock.
