Hi folks,
Upgrading from 2.6.24-rc6 to rc7 Alsa stopped working for me. I still
can access /dev/dsp, change the volume and so on, but the speakers
are quiet. Moving back to rc6 there is no such problem.
Of course the config files are the same (except for some new
CONFIG_SLABINFO variable).

The only difference between rc6 and rc7 in sound/pci/hda/hda_intel.c is
this:

Do you think this could be related to the problem?
Any hint would be highly appreciated. Please mail if I can help to
track this down.
