Subject: [PATCH 00/10] percpu: Per cpu code simplification V2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patchset simplifies the code that arches need to maintain to support
per cpu functionality. Most of the code is moved into arch independent
code. Only a minimal set of definitions is kept for each arch.
The patch also unifies the x86 arch so that there is only a single
asm-x86/percpu.h
V1->V2:
- Add support for specifying attributes for per cpu declarations (preserves
  IA64 model(small) attribute).
  - Drop first patch that removes the model(small) attribute for IA64
  - Missing #endif in powerpc generic config /  Wrong Kconfig
  - Follow Randy's suggestions on how to do the Kconfig settings
