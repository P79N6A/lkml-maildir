Compiling with tracing function turned seemed still to be broken to me:
kernel/built-in.o: In function `early_printk_name':
latency_trace.c:(.text+0x3cd18): undefined reference to `early_printk'
latency_trace.c:(.text+0x3cd40): undefined reference to `early_printk'
kernel/built-in.o: In function `early_print_entry':
latency_trace.c:(.text+0x3cd80): undefined reference to `early_printk'
latency_trace.c:(.text+0x3cdd8): undefined reference to `early_printk'
latency_trace.c:(.text+0x3cdfc): undefined reference to `early_printk'
We made a early_printk patch based on the 8250_early for powerpc 32bit here.
(still absolutely untested and incomplete, we will post it asap). I added
early_printk() and exported _mcount() and could compile succesfully. However the
kernel will not boot. I attached a bdi to it and found out that it stucks at
_mcount in arch/powerpc/kernel/entry_32.S at about line 1080, where the variable
mcount_enabled is loaded and checked. Obviously the variable is still not valid
at the time of check. To check this I took out the lines like above

After recompiling the kernel started normally and it seems to work. I was even
able to make a trace with cyclictest. However there were several crashes (which
might be caused by other problems). I still have to take a closer look.
I am just wondering why the check for mcount_enabled is there at all and I think
that there due to be some better fixes than just throw it out ;-). On the other
side, I just can't find in which way mcount_enabled is used in the tracer at
all. Could you give me some hints on this one?
cheers
