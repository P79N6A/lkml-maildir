poll ?
The -ac kernel btw has code that handles unidentified IRQs by trying all
the IRQ handlers that have been registered and in "irqpoll" mode polling
them each timer tick to handle lost IRQs. In the case where the problem
is simply bad plumbing it works rather well for rescuing otherwise
unusable laptops
