Hmmm... We could do something like
kmem_cache_get(slab, object)
and
kmem_cache_put(slab, object)
kmem_cache_get would disable allocations from the slab and increment a 
refcount.
kmem_cache_put would enable allocations again if the refcount reaches 
one.
The problem is that freeing an object may cause writes to the object. F.e.
poisoning will overwrite the object on free. SLUB will put its free 
pointer in the first words etc.
