I reported a similar problem back when 2.0.34 was current, and the
discussion then indicated that the problem was connected with the BIOS
restriction on booting from within the first 1023 cylinders.
Since then, I've always made /boot a partition of its own, located
well within that 1023 cylinder limit, and every file mentioned in the
/etc/lilo.conf configuration file is in that partition. I've had no
problems since I started doing that.
Best wishes from Riley.
