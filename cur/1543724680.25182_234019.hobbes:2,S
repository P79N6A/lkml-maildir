A secure FS must ensure that other people's deleted data does not end
up in the file.  AFAIK FSs don't record owners for free blocks, so
they can only ensure this by zeroing the blocks.  So I doubt that you
will see any different behaviour from an FS that keeps only meta-data
consistent and writes meta-data before data.

It's too hard to fix the applications, since there is no easy way to
test that they are really fixed.  Also, the number of applications is
much higher than the number of file systems.
The way to go is to fix the file system (well, often it means a new
FS).
The file system should provide something that I call in-order
semantics, i.e., that the disk state always represents an existing
(possibly old) logical state of the FS, not some state that never
existed, or some existing state with missing data.
My favourite approach to achieve these semantics is based on
log-structured file systems (see
<
http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/lfs/>
 for some ideas and also
a longer description of in-order semantics), but there are also other
approaches: I believe that Soft Updates, when implemented correctly,
provide in-order semantics, and Reiser4 may provide them, too.
