Thanks, that looks a lot better.
Do you want me to send you patches based on this tree to help clean up
the sysfs usage now that it's documented?
Also, a lot of your per-cpu sysfs files should probably move to debugfs
as they are for debugging only, right?  No need to clutter up sysfs with
them when only the very few perfmon developers would be needing access
to them.
thanks,
