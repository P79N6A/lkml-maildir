Try adding:
Option "NoAccel"
to the Driver section of your X config.
Some buggy video drivers can stall the PCI bus for tens or hundreds of
*milliseconds*.  The "via" driver had this problem until I identified
the problem and the Unichrome guys fixed it.  If it goes away with
"NoAccel", then you are having the same problem.
For details search the unichrome-devel archives for "losing interrupts".
