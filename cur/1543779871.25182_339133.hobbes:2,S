No, this is how it should have been before. This way it would have been clear 
where the magic 4 came from.

No, ulDestPtr ist ULONG* so we increase it by sizeof(ULONG)*16 which is 64. 
This is one of the places I was talking about where people might miss what's 
going on. ;) IMHO it makes absolutely no sense to use a ULONG* at this place.
