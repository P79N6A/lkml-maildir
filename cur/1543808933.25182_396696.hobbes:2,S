The kernel jumps at Jörg's command. Film at eleven.
Where's my popcorn?
You were told that ide-scsi fixes are not a priority item,
you were shown that ide-cd works,
you were shown that /dev/hd* and /dev/sg* can share the same namespace
(see my proof-of-concept patch), so there's nothing left for you to
want.
Either fix ide-scsi yourself, or fork a few 50 € bills and contract
somebody to do it.
