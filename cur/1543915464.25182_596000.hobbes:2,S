I believe what happened here is an x86_64 build followed by a
UML/x86_64 build with no intervening mrproper.
I've always considered this to be a "don't do that" sort of thing.
However, maybe we could stick the arch of the current build somewhere
in the tree, check that before any serious part of a subsequent
build, and error out if $ARCH is different.
