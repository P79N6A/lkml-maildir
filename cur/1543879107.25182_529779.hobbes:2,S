Embedding an atomic_t in an ABI struct?  That makes everyone else
nervous too, right?
It may look safe on i386/x86-64 today, but this doesn't seem like wise
practice.  Is there any reason to believe that atomic_t will never
change size?  Does anything else do this already?
If nothing else, the "unsigned" (should be __u32, sigh) could be cast to
an atomic_t.
Is being able to do atomic work on a u32 between the kernel and
userspace something that all archs have support for?  I mean, take the
fact that userspace and the kernel could both be doing these atomic ops
on different virtual addresses and so conceivably different cachelines.
Is that a problem for anyone?
I do find myself wondering if the notion of userspace ring
synchronization shouldn't be built around futexes.  They weren't around
when this mmap()ed ring business was created.
