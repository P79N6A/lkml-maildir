That is, of course, an excellent approach.
But beware of being *too* disconnected from the lists@vger.kernel.org.  We
don't want to get in the situation where you pop up with a couple of
person-years' worth of work and other kernel developers have major issues
with it.  Please find a balance - some way of regularly checkpointing.
Also, beware of aiming for a finished product.  We would *much* prefer that
a simple, minimal core, maybe with just a single device driver be merged
into the mainline kernel.  The IBAL developers then proceed to enhance
that, sending regular updates.  Every couple of weeks would suit.
That way everyone else can see the code evolving, and can help, and can
understand.  And other people will fix your bugs for you, and update your
code as kernel-wide changes are implemented.  And we all avoid nasty
surprises and extensive rework.
