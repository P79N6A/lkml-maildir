You have made an eligant point; regardless, I do not do what you propose
because ATA ...... the kernel does not yet know how to fake the OS in
switch to get a boot in a failure.
I will trump the debate with a $2600.00 ATA-Hardware RAID solution I
showed at LWE@NYC.NY 2000.
$2600.00 == 320GB (8x40GB ATA Disks) and an 8-channel Host (3ware).
This was a RAID 0 stripe.
Imagine that you can remove the disks and shuffle in any order (on the
same card) and it finds-reconstructs the RAID?
SCSI can not touch 320GB in disks for $2600.00 USD.
