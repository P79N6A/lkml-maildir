The last time I looked at an Emulex Linux driver (for the LP-7000,
about six months ago), it consisted of a large binary-only portion,
shipped in a .a file, and the source code for a shim to have the
library code talk to the kernel.
Furthermore, the driver was configured by editing a .c file and
rebuilding it.
All in all, a quality experience.
