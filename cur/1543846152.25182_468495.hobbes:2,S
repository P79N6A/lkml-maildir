There isn't much point in doing that if they're as useless as this thread.
Fact is, those bogus warnings are harmful and cause real problems to not be
noticed.  There is value in finding some way of making real warnings
apparent to all developers and testers.
An external post-processor isn't very useful because few people will run
it.  If we can integrate such a thing into the build system and make it
available to all developers and testers then OK.
