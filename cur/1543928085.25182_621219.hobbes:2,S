IWL_POWER_AC and IWL_POWER_BATTERY are just two power modes. IWL_POWER_AC 
would be the default power mode when we're in AC (no power saving) and 
IWL_POWER_BATTERY would be the default power mode when we're in battery 
(power saving mode). That's why we set IWL_POWER_ENABLED flag with 
IWL_POWER_BATTERY, because it is the only power mode that saves power.
We can change to IWL_POWER_BATTERY or IWL_POWER_AC in any moment.
This patch, depending if power management is enabled or not, sets which power 
mode we should use, Then, it checks if we're already using this mode or not.
