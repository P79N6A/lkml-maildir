I am trying to write a signal handler for SEGV that can figure out
what address was being accessed to cause the fault.  Yes, I have a
good reason for wanting this.
The man page for sigaction() implies that the attached program below
should print "si_addr = 0x20".  But when I run it on Linux/x86 2.2.14,
it says the si_addr field is always NULL.  As near as I can tell by
grepping the sources, only the m68k port even tries to set si_addr
appropriately when a memory fault occurs.
Two questions:
  1) Is there an easy way to do what I want on Linux/x86?
     (Disassembling the instruction which caused the fault does not
     qualify as "easy".)
  2) Can the kernel not set si_addr in the siginfo_t correctly?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
static void
signal_handler (int signo, struct siginfo *pinfo, void *puc)
{
  fprintf (stderr, "si_addr == %p\n", pinfo->si_addr);
  exit (0);
}
int
main ()
{
  struct sigaction sa;
  memset(&sa, 0, sizeof sa);
  sa.sa_sigaction = signal_handler;
  sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask);
  sa.sa_flags = SA_SIGINFO;
  
  sigaction (SIGSEGV, &sa, NULL);
  *(int *)32 = 0;
  return 0;
}
