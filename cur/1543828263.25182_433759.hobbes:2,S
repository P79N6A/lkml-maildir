The trace below was done with a nice -n 19 bonnie -s 2047 running, but
the same happens with the find that SuSE starts at annoying times.
Scheduler is cfq, but changing schedulers doesn't help.
Place a shell window over the evolution window, start io, then click on
the evolution window, and see how long it takes to be able to read mail.
Here, it's a couple forevers.
