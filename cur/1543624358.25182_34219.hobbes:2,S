Mandrake Soft should disable the whole sidestepping
ioctl - even the generic one - in a secure kernel.
Filtering them all to -EINVAL is the bast one can do for *security*.
The stuff which is not should be implemented with generic ioctl
with a proper sementics.
Rings a bell?
No matter how you turn it it turns out that the taskfile stuff as it
is is just useless - formal verification inside the kernel can
be done at coding time. Formal verification for vendor specific
stuff can be done in user land. Formal verification for security
stuff doens't make sense, becouse the whole interface doesn't
make sense for security concerns. Formal verification of the
commands for political reasons is just plain naive...
