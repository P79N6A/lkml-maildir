Linus is right.  There just seems to be nobody with the right set of
skills who is interested in doing the work, so it just doesn't get
done.
On the issue of 1:1 versus 1:many:
* The consesus on comp.programming.threads seems to be that 1:1 is
  preferable over 1:many.  It seems to be too difficult to get the
  1:many right, and the Solaris' two-level library seems to have
  considerable problems.  That's why there is an additional 1:1
  library in Solaris 8.
* A proper two-level threads library does need kernel support to start
  new kernel threads when too many of the other kernel threads get
  blocked in the kernel.
