New version of patch is on ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/namespaces-d-S4-pre6.gz
	* Fixed idiotic bug in do_add_mount() - the thing forgot
to pass error value back to the caller.
> News:
> 	* ported to 2.4.4-pre6
> 	* fixes for d_flags races (already in -ac, hopefully will go into
> the main tree soon)
> 	* fixes for sync_inodes()/kill_super() races (submitted to Linus
> and Alan, hopefully will go into the tree soon)
> 	* killed low-memory deadlocks between {u,re,}mount and kswapd.
> 	* further cleanup of fs/super.c
> 
> It works here. Please, help with testing. Patch had somewhat grown, but
> new pieces are fixes for the bugs present in the main tree and these
> fixes had been submitted for inclusion in 2.4, so hopefully it will
> shrink again.
>  							Cheers,
