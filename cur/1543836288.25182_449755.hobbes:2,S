XFS used to do this and it caused lots of problems.  What xfs does now
is to keep an iocount in the inode for outstanding I/Os and ->clear_inode
waits for that I/O to finish using hashed waitqueues.  It would be nice
to have a facility like that in generic code.

Without looking at the code I remember someone from the Namesys people told
me they could use plain mpage_readpages now.  Anything still blocking using
that function?

Another issue is the lack of support for blocksize < pagesize.   This prevents
it from beeing used across architectures.  Even worse when I tried the last
time it didn't allow me to create a 64k blocksize filesystem that I could
actually test on ppc64.
