Nononon... it's much worse than that.
The i860 used a non-self-terminating pipeline, which meant that for
each instruction you had "what to stuff into the pipeline at this
stage" and "what to do with what comes out of the pipeline here",
which means that to compute d = a + b - c you'd have to do something
like:
X = a + b
nop
nop
nop
t = XXX
X = t - c
nop
nop
nop
d = XXX
... where X means don't care.  To compute, say, h = e + f - g in
parallel with this, it would look something like:
X = a + b
X = e + f
nop
nop
t = XXX
u = t - c
X = u - g
nop
nop
d = XXX
h = XXX
Note the instruction u = t - c, even though the left side and right
side don't even belong to the same thread of execution...
