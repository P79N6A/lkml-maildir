Umm, no.  If the user tries mount -t smb2 it would try only that and
if it can't support the server it would fail.  Similar for mount -t cifs
if the server only supports modern dialects, which AFAIK none does.
If you feel fancy add autoprobing to mount, similar to how we do
automatic testing of superblocks for disk filesystems.

Beeing handle based means it actually starts to get useable for Unix
based client, so even if the protocol is not inherently faster the
client side implementation will be a lot faster at least on big
systems because the expensive path generation will go away.
