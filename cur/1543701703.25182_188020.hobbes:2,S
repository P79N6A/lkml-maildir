Okay, the external monitor was a good idea.
I can boot with the external monitor and atyfb.
when I do fbset 1024x768-60, then the screen gets distorted, then I hit
Fn + F5 (Monitor selection) several times, and finally I get a working
picture.
So tell me how we can do register debuggig.
Regards, claas
