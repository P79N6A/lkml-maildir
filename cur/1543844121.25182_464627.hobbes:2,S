Livelocks.  I've described the deliberate one, but I fear there are
accidental ones I haven't thought of.

You forget that the point of this optimisation is to undo mmap_sem while
waiting on the disk IO.  Once we've done that we cannot go looking at ptes
or vmas: another thread could have munapped the whole lot or anything. 
(And we always need to be afraid of use_mm()..)
Once mmap_sem has been dropped we need to go all the way back to the
process's virtual address and redo the vma lookup.  The easy and clean way
of doing that is to rerun the fault, reuse all the existing code.

Yup, it would need some temporary ifdeffery while architetures convert.
But bear in mind my earlier comments regarding possible optimisations to
this code.
