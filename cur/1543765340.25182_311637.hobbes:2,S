Hardlinks aren't a problem when entering a file as if it's a
directory, provided the directory does not contain any hard links to a
parent in the hierarchy.  In other words, as long as it's a directed
acyclic graph.
This is trivially always true for virtual directories such as entering
an archive file.  And detachable/movable mountpoints are a nice and
sensible way to implement it.  Some work has actually been done on this.
Experiments with the reiserfs file-as-directory extension showed that
applications are generally ok with it.  It looks like a file, but you
can cd into it or follow a path lookup into it.
Linus had some good ideas on the exact semantics to implement when
doing path lookup on these objects.
