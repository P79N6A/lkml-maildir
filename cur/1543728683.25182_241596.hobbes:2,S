You probably need to explicitly ACCEPT incoming to the port that Bittorrent
uses. A tracker module to sniff traffic to known outbound tracker ports, to
detect which port Bittorrent is using, and allow that inbound, seems a little
bit excessive to me, not to mention that people set up trackers on the most
varying range of seemingly random ports :-)
Either way, common sane principles of TCP/IP apply with Bittorrent too,
if both parties are firewalled, you wont transfer any data between eachother.
If one party (out of two) is unfirewalled, data can be transfered both ways
between them, the firewalled party will established connection to the unfirewalled
to get communication going.
