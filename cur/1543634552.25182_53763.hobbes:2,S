Any plans for getting this into the kernel Neil ?
I get quite a few questions from people who either do not understand
that you cannot partition md devices (and do various rather
involuntarily interesting setups because of that), or people who
understand the limitation but not the reason behind it.
Thinking about it, I don't know the reason   ;)
It's really a functionality that a lot of people feel naturally is
there, and I can't blame them.
