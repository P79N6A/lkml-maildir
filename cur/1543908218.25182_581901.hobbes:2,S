before 2.6.22, a stack of dm and/or md devices (not loop, and not
md/raid0 or md/linear) would use more stack the more devices were
involved.  If you made a very deep stack, you could push the stack
over any limit you chose.
I won't say "a lot of stack" as I haven't measured the exact amount,
just "more stack as you add more devices".
