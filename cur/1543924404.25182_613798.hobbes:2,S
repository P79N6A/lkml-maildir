Hi ,
I have also the same problem on my SMP box[1] ( i686 ), random hard freeze I can just hard reset the box.
I'm not able to capture any output :/ keyboard does not work , netconsole does not have any output when freeze occurs,
nor I have any 'BUG:' , 'Oops:' or the like messages in any logs.
The only thing I noticed is :
...
Clocksource tsc unstable (delta = 4686944957 ns)
^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^ <-- may be some sort data corruption :/
...
as latest kernel message before most freeze. 
Booting with different clocksource does not make any difference.
I do not use nvidia , in fact I don't use any external kernel module on that box.
Anyway it seems to work fine on non-SMP also my laptops does not have that problem with the same kernel.
If needed I can post the config but I tested a lot different configs with the same result.
Is there any rt-git tree I can test ?
Regards,
Gabriel
