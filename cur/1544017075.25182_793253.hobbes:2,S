One of the things that was bugging me was that after having booted 2.6.29-rc1, 
rebooting to 2.6.28 final always caused an automatic relabel, which on this 
box with a bit over a terrabyte in drives, takes an extra 20 minutes to do.
So I grepped the .config's and there is no mention of SELINUX in the output of 
a make oldconfig for 2.6.29-rc1, based on a 2.6.28 .config input.
I see the security/selinux directory still exists in the src tree.  Is this a 
kconfig bug, or is selinux outta here?
Thanks.
