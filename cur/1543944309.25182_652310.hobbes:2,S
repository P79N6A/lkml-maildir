Note I wrote the one above only as a reply to Linus' proposal, not
because I was advocating "live debugging" (or rather I think if you want
that just use gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore) 
I agree with you in principle, but what do you do if one of the CPUs doesn't 
answer? 
Ingo seems to think it's ok for the debugger then to just hang too,
I think it should eventually time out and debug anyways.
Also there are some limits on how much the system should be frozen
down. For example if you're strict about this requirement you
would need to require full DMA quiescence (like kexec does). But that's
obvious not a good idea for the debugger. So it's always shades
of gray, not black/white.
What I find strange with the current patch is that it goes to extreme
measures to stop the CPUs (will hang forever), but not do the whole
thing (DMA quiescence too)
