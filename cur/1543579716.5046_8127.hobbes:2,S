You have a point.
It would be nice if ioremap took a argument indicating the desired
memory type -- normal, nocache, write-through, write-combining, etc.
Then it could look in an architecture-specific table to get the
appropriate page flags for that type.
(x86 processors with PAT and IA64 can set write-combining through page
flags.  x86 processors with MTRRs but not PAT would need a more
elaborate implementation for write-combining.)

The boot_cpu_data.x86 > 3 test is there because the 386 doesn't have
PWT.
