I had a simillar problem some years ago. I had core dumps and gcc errors all 
the time but memtest could not find a thing. 99% it was a CPU problem and not 
a memory problem. It seemed that there were errors at random times even when 
there was no cpu load.
I believe it was a cache problem. I made a simple prog (like memburn) that 
allocated memory blocks and then did some read/write on them (alloc+write 5 
blocks, check 1, free 1, alloc+write 6, check 2, free 2 alloc+write 7....). 
After that whenever the program encountered an error it looped on this block 
forever. 
The errors occured after a random period of time (from 1 block allocation to 
more than an hour) and were never reproduced after a stop/start. When this 
test program was running and looping on the bad block, gcc never displayed 
errors. The problem was fixed when I replaced the CPU and I'm still using the 
same DIMMs without problems. I also did a lot of checks before replacing the 
CPU, like changing the position of the DIMMs, removing one of them, change 
their timing, and much more without success. Even removed all the PCI cards.
Disabling the CPU cache or replacing it can be a good test.
