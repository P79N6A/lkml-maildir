The key question in my view was what code was easiest to understand.
This is closest to being the code that is shortest, stripped of all
non-essential detail.  But not exactly.  Code is more like novel or
essay in my view, than a poem.  I don't find haiku clear.  However,
what is easiest to understand is a judgement call.
Since we were seeing here, with the remarks of folks such as myself,
a nice example of that well known phenomenon where a committee will
debate for hours over the $25 budget line item, and then pass the
$3 million item without comment, your conclusion to try using the
Trivial Patch Monkey sounds like a winner.  Rusty has good judgement,
and for changes such as this, better one good judge making immediate
decisions, than lengthy lkml threads.
