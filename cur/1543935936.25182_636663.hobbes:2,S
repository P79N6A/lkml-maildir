Roland, could you help here?
I can actually see a bug which may be related:
  1. a process creates a thread (or more threads)
  2. I attach/detach to that thread with strace several times
     (each time pressing CTRL-C to quit strace)
  3. the whole thread group (except the traced thread) ends in
     TASK_STOPPED
I looked at what strace was doing to that thread, and it sometimes sends
SIGSTOP shortly before detaching. This is done when the thread is
running, i.e. not waiting in ptrace_stop. Then PTRACE_DETACH returns
- -ESRCH because it requires the tracee to be stopped -- just like all
PTRACE_* requests except TRACEME and ATTACH. So, strace has no other
option than to send an explicit SIGSTOP to the thread to stop it and
discard it afterwards.
Could this be related?
Kind regards,
Petr Tesarik
