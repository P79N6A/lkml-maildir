Various distributions (e.g. RH 7.0) contain the SCSI 
mid-level patch that will permit the sg_reset utility
to perform a scsi bus reset. [The same patch makes the 
scsi subsystem respect device reservations.]
The patch originates from James Bottomley (see the linux-scsi
list archive) and he has submitted a new version for the lk 2.4
tree recently. When first submitted, objections were raised to 
the concept of allowing users to do scsi bus resets (see same 
list archive). 
There is a chance that the required patch will go into main 
kernel tree soon.
