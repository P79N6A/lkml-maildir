Thanks!
I need to track this a bit more.
Could you please provide me with information of what
you are running.
make version (make --version)
shell & version of shell
distribution
Could you also try if the attached two Makefiles exhibit the same problem.
Just copy them to an empty directory and execute make.
A good run looks like:
Makefile2:1: lds=-P
Hi
A bad run does not have any -P after the '='.
Needless to say my make does not exhibit this issue.
