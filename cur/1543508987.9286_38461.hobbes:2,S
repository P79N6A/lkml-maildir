The present code is wrong.
(For example, because it will overwrite memory after the array bases[],
possibly the arrays setup_called[] and setup_buson[].)
If your change makes things work for you, then fine
(but you do not eliminate this bug).
Chris promised a new version of his patch, so probably
the official kernel version will soon be fine again.
Until that moment, if you want to use aha1542.c as a module,
reverting the 2.2.11 patch is safest.
