  get an error if I try to delete two routes. So, a work-around of
  always deleting two identical routes doesn't work very well.
and if we change route to delete all the routes, then you'll nuke
your ppp route.
maybe we should build some heuristics into the route command to
try and figure out when we should delete all duplicate routes,
and when not to.
or perhaps an "-amount_of_devices"  parameter to route would be
more practical.
or maybe we should try put some AI stuff into the kernel to
always get the route that the user wants added in. surely an
improvement on the current kernel auto route add stuff.

somebody please point me at the patch where add_auto_route was
introduced. :)

Paul.
