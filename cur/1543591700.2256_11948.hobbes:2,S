Yes, you do. And it's true that renumbering is problematical; I 
hadn't thought of all the implications. Say, you have a system with 
hot-plug slots on two buses, and someone hot-plugs a card with a 
bridge (fairly common; most dual/quad Ethernet boards have a bridge). 
If the buses were numbered densely to begin with, they're going to 
have to be renumbered above the point that the new bridge was added.
Phooey. Well, it can still be done, but it's a bit more complicated 
than the bus/dev/fcn-to-location map I was imagining. You'd have to 
describe the topology of the built-in buses, and dynamically make the 
correspondences. As you say, "know the tree", by topology, not bus 
numbers.
