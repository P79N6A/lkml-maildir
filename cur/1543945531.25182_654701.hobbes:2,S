To make a long story short, the USB symptoms you describe indicate a
problem with interrupt routing.  This could well explain the other
difficulties too.  There are various kernel parameters you can try
putting on the boot command line to work around it:  acpi=noirq or
acpi=off or pci=noacpi or a few others.
