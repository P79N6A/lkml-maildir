Does this patch solve the now infamous Linux<->Sun NFS-server bug? If so,
I'd love to have it, be it inefficient or not, because AIX still hasn't
got their NFS-code fixed... Kind of annoying if you have source-code
mounted from an nfs-server running AIX.
Of course, I wouldn't mind if it was efficient, but...
