Yes, it is set in BIOS to use ECP, EPP, IRQ 7 and DMA 3.
There is another interesting line in the log that you didn't quote. The
driver actually knows about DMA 3:
0x378: ECP settings irq=7 dma=3
Just in case, that board is Asus P5A-B with the latest BIOS:
P5A-B BIOS ver. 1010, 05/31/2000
For comparison, I took a board with VIA chipset and PhoenixBIOS 4.0
Release 6.0, and it works properly with another 2.4.3-ac9 kernel:
Winbond Super-IO detection, now testing ports 3F0,370,250,4E,2E ...
SMSC Super-IO detection, now testing Ports 2F0, 370 ...
PnPBIOS: Parport found PNPBIOS PNP0401 at io=0378,0778 irq=7 dma=3
0x378: FIFO is 16 bytes
0x378: writeIntrThreshold is 8
0x378: readIntrThreshold is 8
0x378: PWord is 8 bits
0x378: Interrupts are ISA-Pulses
0x378: ECP port cfgA=0x10 cfgB=0x4b
0x378: ECP settings irq=7 dma=3
parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778), irq 7, dma 3
[PCSPP,TRISTATE,COMPAT,ECP,DMA]
