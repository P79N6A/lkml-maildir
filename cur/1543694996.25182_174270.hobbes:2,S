I didn't get time to do this before the disk in my laptop died. I've put it a
new disk and installed 2.6.0-test7, and IDE now seems to works after a resume.
I think the disk is still spinning down before suspend (it's difficult to tell,
because I can hardly hear the new disk) and this needs to be fixed at some
point.
