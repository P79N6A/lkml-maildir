pfn_valid() is intended for that. However it cannot work 
when you have more than 4GB memory and IO memory holes below 4GB.
Testing the reserved bit of the struct page * may work in
that case, although it can give false positives when you try
this with random memory (some people set reserved on real memory
for other reason)
