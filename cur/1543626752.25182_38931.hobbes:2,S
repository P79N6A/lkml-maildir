I couldn't work out how to make BK even attempt that. 
If you commit harmless and irrelevant changeset 'X' to a repository, then 
commit a completely separate changeset 'Y' which doesn't touch any of the 
same files, then it seems to be impossible¹ to import 'Y' into a different 
tree without also importing 'X'.
