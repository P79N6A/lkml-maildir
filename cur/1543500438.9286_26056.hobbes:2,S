    Ouch... Does it imply that for two threads sharing the descriptors (cloned
    with COPY_FILES) dup2(foo, bar); and close(foo); may legitmately result in
    both foo an bar closed?
Such things are not forbidden.
The Rationale says:
The dup2() function is not intended for use in critical regions as a
synchronization mechanism.
and
Least obvious is the possible effect of a signal-catching function that could
be invoked between steps and allocate or deallocate file descriptors.
In short - the details are implementation dependent.
The close will take time, and it may well be that it turns out that
afterwards fd1 does not exist anymore. I imagine that you return EBADF
in such a case.
