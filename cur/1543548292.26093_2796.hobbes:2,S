Hello all,
between kernel 2.4.0-test7 and test8 something has happened to break my
USB mouse.
Platform is a PowerMac equipped with an OPTI USB-controller on a PCI
card.
I've seen a lot of lockups from the USB system on test7 ---
some of them have gone in test8, especially when loading modules.
But now the mouse doesn't work at all, as apparent from the log:

... and so on
The other mouse mentioned in the log is an Apple mouse on the ADB bus,
which works well.
See you,
