First, I appologize for this UNtimely response... I'm swamped...

I'll have a look...

No. no..  this is so even if file is a DIRECTORY!  Marking a
directory as setgid is commonly done to force files and
subdirectories to inheret the parent group ownership.  One may
even wish to do this without setting group execute privs on the
directory.  This is NOT mandatory locking, because it is a
directory, yet this effectively prunes the whole branch as seen
via knfs!

I believe the concern is that mandatory locking can potentialy
HANG a system, since even root will block on a write.  Opening
read-only may be safe though... I'm no expert.

Ick... needs to be fixed, but not critical in my application. If
I'm doing file locking via nfs, then the nfs server must be
critical to multiple servers. This means I do not trust it to do
anything BUT nfs, and it therefore should not be locking exported
files.
