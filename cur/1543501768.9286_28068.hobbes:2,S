Do we _want_ directory walkers to look inside these things?
I'm all for find not looking inside (unless you explicitly do "find
my_document/" which will work), rm -rf just deletes it as a whole, cp -r
copies it as a whole, tar cvf tars it as a whole etc.

Agreed.  I'm all for using directories.
In my view of albods, the file form would be only for making the
document appear as a file, and let it copy/attach/transfer as a file.
