Sounds good.  I don't see this in your patchset you sent yesterday 
though; did you add it after sending out those patches?  if so, could 
you forward the new patch?  does it explicitly prevent stolen time from 
getting accounted as  user/system time or does it just rely on NO_HZ 
mode sort of happening to work that way (since the one shot timer is 
skipped ahead for missed ticks)?
thanks,
Dan
