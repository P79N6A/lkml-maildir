Ok, I've had a look at the kprobes batch registration mechanisms and..
well, it does not look well suited for the markers. Adding
supplementary data structures such as linked lists of probes does not
look like a good match.
However, I agree with you that providing a similar API is good.
Therefore, here is my proposal :
The goal is to do the synchronize just after we unregister the last
probe handler provided by a given module. Since the unregistration
functions iterate on every marker present in the kernel, we can keep a
count of how many probes provided by the same module are still present.
If we see that we unregistered the last probe pointing to this module,
we issue a synchronize_sched().
It adds no data structure and keeps the same order of complexity as what
is already there, we only have to do 2 passes in the marker structures :
the first one finds the module associated with the callback and the
second disables the callbacks and keep a count of the number of
callbacks associated with the module.

P.S.: here is the code.
Linux Kernel Markers - Architecture Independant code Provide internal
synchronize_sched() in batch.
