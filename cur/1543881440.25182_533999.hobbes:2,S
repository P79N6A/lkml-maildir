I missed that, concentrating on finding the method of telling it the delay I 
guess.
So then the next question is, over what period is that obviously lower figure 
being averaged over?  Certainly not over a 1 second period else it would then 
be much higher, as seen by the figures after the initial delay.  The time 
slice spec'd in /proc/sys/kernel/sched_granularity_ns, which here is 
currently 5000000 or 5 milliseconds?  If that was the case, the first answer 
would be in the area of 15, not 200.
So educate me, off list if you would like and have the time.
Thanks Niel.
