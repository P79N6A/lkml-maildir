Yep, as it all depends on code complexity, some of these cases might  
not be "errors" at all - instead for that kind of functionality they  
might _require_ bigger stacks.
If you have 64 bit machines common place and memory a lot cheaper I  
don't see how it is beneficial to force smaller stack sizes without  
giving consideration to the code complexity, architecture and  
requirements.
(Solaris for example, seems to be going to have 16Kb kernel stacks on  
64 bit machines.)
So, please let's leave stack size as an option for users to choose  
and stop this 4Kb stack war. May be after a little rest I will start  
another one demanding 16Kb stacks :)
