This is a known issue.  The following patch has been proposed
http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/developer/patches/viewpatch.php?id=4030/1
although I just notice that it has been marked as "discarded".
Apparently Russell King commited a better patch so this should be
fixed in git when he sends his next pull request.
