  Okay. Another thing is how to deal with IRQ's and the port regions. This
can vary from platform to platform. We could have this as a command line
option as well. In fact we might since it can be built as a module. Alot
of platforms added things to the command line inside the kernel code.
  Or we can do lots of #ifdef in i8042.h or using the asm/keyboard method
like now. Personally I don't like this method since even on mips the i8042
port range varies on different machines. So we still end up with a bunch
of messy #ifdef.
