AFAIK, you are free to disagree as long as I or we can also

I don't have an argument with most of that, but I am concerned
about how much memory each entry requires and how useful it really
is.  IOW, if I need to know the module parameters for a module,
I can probably find that info somewhere else, like in
/etc/modprobe.conf or a script etc., so why waste memory on it?
But then there's the question of if someone else needs to know
the module parameters that were used, where do they look?
I could say:  same answer as I gave above.
Or you could say:  exposed in /sys.
If memory usage is not an issue, I'll agree.
