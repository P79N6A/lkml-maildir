incident.Alhaji musa is an international bussiness man and a major supplier 
of Yamaha machine parts in this country.He has an account with this bank 
which he uses to finance his bussiness in this contry. this is my bank 
website in burkina faso (  www.bkofafrica.net)
I kept this information secret within myself to enable the whole plans and 
idea be profitable and successful during the time of execution.The said 
amount was USD$1m.(one million united states dollars). As it may intrest you 
to know, I got your contact through my country chamber of commerce and  
international relations here in Burkina-Faso. even the deceased man Alhaji 
Dahiru J Musa. account information is with me rigth now. so my dear if you

smooth conclusion of is transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the 
total sum as gratification,while 10% will be set aside to take care of 
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer, while the remaining 60%

between you and i for  i am still in service and intend to retire from

your willingness to assit me in this bussiness.
I will send to you the official application letter of the bank which you are 
to use in putting an official claim over the fund.I will be monitoring the
