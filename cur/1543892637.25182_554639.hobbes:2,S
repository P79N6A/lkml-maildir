This is false-alarm output from something intended to track down a 
reported bug.  The patch responsible is this one: 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.22-rc4/2.6.22-rc4-mm2/broken-out/usb-try-to-debug-bug-8561.patch
It was removed from -mm just recently; you can simply revert it in your 
kernel source.
