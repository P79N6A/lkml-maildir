Hi,
I am doing some similar FS comparisons, but using IOzone
(www.iozone.org)
instead of Netbench.
Some preliminary (mostly raw) data are available at:
http://www.osdlab.org/reports/journal_fs/
(updated today).
I am using a Linux 2.4.7 on a 4-way VA Linux system.
It has 4 GB of RAM, but I have limited it to 256 MB in
accordance with IOzone run rules.
However, I suspect that this causes IOzone to measure disk
subsystem or PCI bus performance more than it does FS performance.
Any comments on this?
Default configurations for all filesystems were used.
Future:
. measure operations/second
. kernel profiling
. measure CPU utilization for each FS
. make graphs more readable
. do some FS comparison graphs
Regards,
~Randy
