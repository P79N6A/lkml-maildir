How about cygwin/windows?  It has no concept of static device numbers. 
And what about external usb disks on any other unix os?  Surely they 
don't have static minor device numbers in the face of hot plugging?
The bug is in tar and that is what needs fixed.  It should not attach 
any meaning to the device number, but rather should assume that the 
admin knows what he is doing when he said to backup a given path using a 
given incremental backup log, and that he isn't yanking tar's chain and 
pointing it to a different path between incremental backups.
