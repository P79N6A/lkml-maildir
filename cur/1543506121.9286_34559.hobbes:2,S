No. I strongly vote to remove raid-0.90 from 2.2.12 again, because it
breaks user space semantics so heavily. Not only the formats are
incompatible (or so it seems), the user space tools were renamed, too.
So I do not only have to fix the raid arrays themselves, but also the
init-scripts.
One should not break semantics inside a stable kernel revision so
thoroughly. Not even as a present to Red Hat... (SuSE 6.x still uses
"mdadd v0.3d compiled for md raidtools-0.41").
Save this change for 2.4!
