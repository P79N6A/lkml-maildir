The conceptual change looks fine to me, but the code looks a little odd,
what about:
static __init unsigned long __maxindex(unsigned int height)
{
	unsigned int tmp = height * RADIX_TREE_MAP_SHIFT;
	int shift = RADIX_TREE_INDEX_BITS - tmp;
	if (shift < 0)
		return ~0UL;
	return ~0UL >> shift;
}
instead?
