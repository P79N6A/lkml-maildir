Being standards compliant is not an argument it's a design goal, a 
requirement. Standards compliance is like pregant, you are or you're 
not. And to deliberately ignore standards for speed is saying "it's too 
hard to do it right, I'll do it wrong and it will be faster." The answer 
is to do it smarter, with solutions like relatime (which can be enhanced 
as Linus noted) which provide performance benefits without ignoring 
standards, or use of a filesystem which does a better job. But when it 
goes in the kernel the choice of having per-filesystem behavior either 
vanishes or becomes an exercise in complex and as-yet unwritten mount 
options.
There are certainly ways to improve ext3, not journaling atime updates 
would certainly be one, less frequent updates of dirty inodes, whatever. 
But if a user wants to give up standards compliance it should be a 
deliberate choice, not something which the average user will not 
understand or learn to do.
