Here it is at the end of this mail. (Slightly different, 100% equivalent)
Today, looking at the sources, I have noticed something strange:
In open.c, there is:
/* If times==NULL, set access and modification to current time,
 * must be owner or have write permission.
 * Else, update from *times, must be owner or super user.
 */
asmlinkage int sys_utime(char * filename, struct utimbuf * times)
{
[....]
        /* Don't worry, the checks are done in inode_change_ok() */
        newattrs.ia_valid = ATTR_CTIME | ATTR_MTIME | ATTR_ATIME;
        if (times) {
                error = get_user(newattrs.ia_atime, &times->actime);
                if (!error)
                        error = get_user(newattrs.ia_mtime, &times->modtime);
                if (error)
                        goto dput_and_out;
                newattrs.ia_valid |= ATTR_ATIME_SET | ATTR_MTIME_SET;
        } else {
                if (current->fsuid != inode->i_uid &&
                    (error = permission(inode,MAY_WRITE)) != 0)
                        goto dput_and_out;
        }
        error = notify_change(dentry, &newattrs);
[...]
}
What interests me is the ``else'' part: if I am not the owner and if I
can't write to the file, deny permission. So far so good, as announced in
the comment. The problem is that notify_change calls inode_change_ok
where permissions are rechecked: extract from attr.c
int inode_change_ok(struct inode *inode, struct iattr *attr)
{
[...]
        /* Check for setting the inode time. */
        if (ia_valid & (ATTR_MTIME_SET | ATTR_ATIME_SET)) {
                if (current->fsuid != inode->i_uid && !capable(CAP_FOWNER))
                        goto error;
        }
There, I raise an error if I am not the owner of the file, whether I have
write permissions or not.
So can I touch a file I don't own if I have write permissions on it ? If
yes, the code is incorrect, if no, the comment in the source is incorrect.
