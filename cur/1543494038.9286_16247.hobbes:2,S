Subject: 48 day uptime problem?

Two of our machines running kernel 2.2.1 had networking problems
after 48 days of uptime. Both of these are DEC alphas (miata),
running what was Red Hat 5.0 but nearly everything has been
upgraded.
Basically, they have problems connecting to other machines
running 2.2.1, or to SGI Irix 5.3; they connect fine to all other
machines on the network (Linux/Intel 2.0.x, FreeBSD 3.1, Digital
Unix, AIX and perhaps others). Hosts running Linux 2.2.1 or Irix
do respond to ping, but telnet, rsh, ftp, imap no longer work: it
just says "Connected to ..." and hangs there. Vice versa, a Linux
2.2.1 machine can no longer telnet into this one -- but an Irix
machine can telnet in, only telnetting out is blocked.
The first time this happened, 6 days ago, I tried manually
restarting all network services, inetd, etc. It didn't work.
Eventually a reboot cured the problem. Now the identical problem
has cropped up on another machine with a near-identical
configuration and same kernel. In both cases it was after
exactly 48 days of uptime. Since all other services were manually
restarted I think it's a kernel problem. 
Has this been seen before, and is it fixed in the newer kernels?
Thanks
Rahul.
