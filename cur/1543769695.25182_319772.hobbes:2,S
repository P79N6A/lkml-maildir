Here is a response from Bruce Allen.

This is false.
Modern ATA and SCSI disk drives have several thousand spare sectors.
When a sector is unreadable (UNC) which means that the ECC codes are
inconsistent, the drive will REALLOCATE the sector, assigning a spare
sector the LBA of the failed sector.  However it will only do this when
you WRITE to the LBA of the failed sector.

Sectors can have inconsistent ECC codes for a number of reasons:
   -- failed write during sudden power-down
   -- damage to magnetic media at this LBA
   -- other reasons

Not true.  Disks which have reallocated large numbers of blocks are
usually failing. But most good disks have some reallocated blocks.

It won't 'recover' the bad block.  It will write the data (obtained from
the good drive) to a newly allocated spare sector on the bad drive.
