Please don't "queue things up to track them".  Just queue them up to merge
them, or don't queue them at all.
Because if you queue it up then I will not.  If you later for some reason
unqueue it then volia, it is lost.  We should aim to avoid having multiple
copies of a patch sitting around the place.
I shall not merge this patch - it is yours.

drivers/char/*?  Very rarely maintained.  git-whatchanged tells the story
