I'd really like to have a new format altogether that does not
involve dashes as a separator.  The reason is that dash is used
as a part of the name of certain algorithms.
Once dm-crypt starts using the givcrypt interface instead of its
own IV generators, we can get away with just a single algorithm
string, of the form
	geniv(mode(block-cipher))
Obviously stream ciphers would just be
	geniv(stream-cipher)
So when that happens we can just use the format "-string" as
that's an invalid specification in the current format.
Of course we'd continue to support the current format as well
which can coexist with the new format forever.
Cheers,
