A class number is an excellent idea, and could have potential 
performance gains.  I thought of making such a patch, but expected it 
would be rejected since it is necessarily required and would require 
changes to significant sections of the kernel (to add the class to each 
object type).
Have any better ideas for an implementation that doesn't touch so many 
sections of the kernel?
