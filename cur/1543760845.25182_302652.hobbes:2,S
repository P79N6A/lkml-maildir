Got another such "hung" and tried to debug it somehow.
Did a task dump (echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger when logged
from network) -- nothing interesting; kseriod trace looks
a bit weird but it is as weird in normal mode too:
kseriod       S 00000000     0   196      1           361   122 (L-TLB)

Everything on the system is sleeping.
After plugging in USB keyboard and loading uhci-hcd and
usbhid, the keyboard un-freeze, but mouse still didn't
work.  So I tried re-loading psmouse module, and
surprizingly, mouse started working again, but now dmesg
says:
  input: PS2++ Logitech Wheel Mouse on isa0060/serio1
(normally it's
  input: ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse on isa0060/serio1
)
and the mouse is moving very fast now.  Previously
I either didn't able to make it work at all after such
freeze, or it worked automatically after loading usbhid.
BTW, it's 2.6.10, I can't made it work with 2.6.11 at all.
