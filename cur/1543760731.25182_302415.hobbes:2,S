Ho hum.  The perfctr syscall API has changed so many times that whenever
someone adds a syscall I have rejects to fix up in probably ten different
patches.
It would be nice to start folding these patches together a bit to reduce
such problems, but that's rather non-trivial because there is no way to
simply join these patches together which maintains a sensible sequencing.
If we're going to do anything then it's either a major refactoring, or
simply wham the entire feature into a single diff.  That diff could then be
split into four patches: core, ppc, x86 and x86_64.  We would lose the
layering between ye olde perfctr, the inheritance implementation, the syfs
API, etc.  I could live with that.
What do you think?
