This is at least arguable and not applicable, since we are talking  
about Linux and not UNIX here. UNIX is just fine using IOCTL or  
SYSCTL instead of a crude pseudo file system for this kind of things.

That is not the question at hand and an invalid statement per se.  
It's not a design goal in itself to have everything in user space.  
However you admitt indirectly that the problem in question is valid  
and that it exists on the design level of the interface at hand and  
that it's an inherent error in this interface, since you don't know a  
solution to it.

Problems which can be solved by proper solutions easly and without  
cost should be solved and not talked away to justify someones idee  
fixe about interface desing.
