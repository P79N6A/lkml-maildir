Your proposal: We disallow the reload if either end of a live partition moves.

That's complex. I wouldn't be inclined to let you change the start of an 
active partition.
Changing the _finish_, however, shouldn't be too much of a problem. You leave
it up to the user to make sure they resize the filesystem appropriately. So
there's no extra code in the kernel. Just one fewer check for the ioctl.
