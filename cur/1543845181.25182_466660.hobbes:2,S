Why can't the device itself manage it? If you want to stub out the
common parts just create a function like netdev_suspend and call it at
appropriate time.

They complement each other. They are different and need different
methods to operate.

The only mess is that you refused to deepen the classification (i.e.
have sub-classes). If input could be a parent class and
mice/event/js/ts would grow from it it won't be such a mess.
Alternatively we could go with input vs input_intf classes if flat
classification is a must. Anyway, I don't think we want to break udev
again.

Kay did send it and I agree with all his reasons as to why we need the
move. However I do not agree with your implementation.

If there was no real discussion why you requesting these changes to be
