I'd instead suggest that we implement a new EXPORT_SYMBOL_UNEXPORT_SCHEDULED
(?) and use that.  Suitable compile-time and modprobe-time warnings would
be needed.  Put the unexport date in a comment at the
EXPORT_SYMBOL_UNEXPORT_SCHEDULED site or even in the modprobe-time warning
message, if that's convenient:
EXPORT_SYMBOL_UNEXPORT_SCHEDULED(foo, "Dec 2006");
