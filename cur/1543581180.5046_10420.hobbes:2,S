yep. The/my goal would be to get some sort of async IO capability that is
able to read the pagecache without holding up the process. And just
because i've already implemented the helper-kernel-thread async IO variant
[in fact what TUX does is that there are per-CPU async IO helper threads,
and we always pick the 'localized' thread, to avoid unnecessery cross-CPU
traffic], i'd like to explore the possibility of getting this done via a
pure, IRQ-driven state-machine - which arguably has the lowest overhead.
but i just cannot find any robust way to do this with ext2fs (or any other
disk-based FS for that matter). The horror scenario: the inode block is
not cached yet, and the block resides in a triple-indirected block which
triggers 3 other block reads, before the actual data block can be read.
And i definitely do not see why kiobufs would help make this any easier.
