That's one part, but this won't update all the pci_map_rom() callers
who use asm/io.h accessors on the mapping they get back.  Even
pci_read_rom() in the sysfs code this change was aimed at uses
memcpy_fromio().
Also, as an aside, if we're on a system where the x86 BIOS is unlikely
to be executed anyways, we should always use the PCI ROM bar mapping
to access the video card's ROM.
