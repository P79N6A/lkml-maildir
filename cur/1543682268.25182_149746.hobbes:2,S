I agree.  As vger postmaster I think I'll start shitcanning them, but
unfortunately most of these threads startup while I'm sleeping so it's
hard for me to get a regexp in place to block the thread.
So, let me put it this way, if you start a BK flame thread it is _YOU_
who I will blacklist from posting to vger.kernel.org
