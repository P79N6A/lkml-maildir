Notice that we want to be able to suspend while hibernating -- for
suspend to both behaviour. So drivers may _not_ rely on system being
runnable.
(Suspend to both is: write image to disk, then suspend to RAM. If you
do not run out of battery, resume is from RAM and fast, if you do, you
still can do resume from disk, not loosing your data).
