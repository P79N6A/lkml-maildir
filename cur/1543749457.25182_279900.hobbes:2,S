Unfortunately not - the version I 'upgraded' from was not on their web site, 
so I don't have a way back.
I was a thought that crossed my mind, although the detailed problem of 
multiple interrupts after apparently successfully completing the 0x3c command 
still occurred in exactly the same way and place when using 2.6.10-rc3.
