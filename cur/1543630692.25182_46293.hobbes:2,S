I didn't noticed the API changed in the docs, so my suggestion of
yesterday to remove such two lines is wrong sorry. I was only reading
the kernel code and I was using my own old debugging initrd were I could
reproduce the ext3 problem. Interestingly there's no way to guess the
new API by only reading the kernel code like I was doing.
