In the kernel space.    I've looked at the boot-time allocation examples and
Rubini's
allocator.c.  I don't have the option of making the user compile the kernel to
obtain a chunk of the high memory by passing in the 'mem' option at boot time.
 Here's the scenario:  I need to be able to alloc virtual memory, create the
page table
and temporarily pin down (lock) the pages in memory in order to do the DMA.
This
memory should be paged in and out as needed.    This memory should also have
visibility across processes.
Does the VM_RESERVED flag lock down the memory so that it doesn't get paged out
during DMA?

Is there a good way to allocate large sums of memory in Linux?  Doesn't have to
be
vmalloc but I don't think kmalloc, get_free_pages will work for this purpose.  I
looked
into get_free_pages, but the largest order is 9 which results in 512 pages.
Does the memory allocated by vmalloc has visibility across processes?

Great.  I see remap_page_range and nopage examples.

I didn't mean shared memory.   If several processes open a given device,
under normal conditions the data structure stays till the last close at which
time a
release is done.   This depends on the usage or minor number count.  Can there
be a case where the device exits before the processes close?   In which case
the processes will be left hanging.    How is the close handled if the driver is
killed?

Yep, I'll look at them.  Thanks a lot for your reply.
