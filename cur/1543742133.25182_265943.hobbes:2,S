I've been working on the ACPI CA project for over 6 years, and trust me,
this has been tried before.  There are significant reasons for having
the interpreter in the kernel.
You don't really want to page out the interpreter when you are using it
for things like suspend/resume, thermal control, and many other things.
I think we have a list around somewhere with many of the reasons, I will
look for it.
