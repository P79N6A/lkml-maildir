Agreed...  Tangent a bit, I wanted to plug using macros which IMHO make
code even more readable:
	val = RTL_R32(REG2);
	RTL_W32(REG2, val);
Since these are driver-private, if you are only dealing with one chip
you could even shorten things to "R32" and "W32", if that doesn't offend
any sensibilities :)
