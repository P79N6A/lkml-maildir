Hi Steve,
Here's one more cleanup for a file in fs/cifs - readdir.c (i'm going to 
follow the order you told me you'd prefer first, then do the remaining 
files in arbitrary order).
I'm going to send the patches inline to make it easy for others to comment 
if they so choose, but since you had problems with inline patches from me 
last time I've also placed them online for you :
http://www.linuxtux.org/~juhl/kernel_patches/fs_cifs_readdir-whitespace-cleanup-1.patch
http://www.linuxtux.org/~juhl/kernel_patches/fs_cifs_readdir-whitespace-cleanup-2.patch
http://www.linuxtux.org/~juhl/kernel_patches/fs_cifs_readdir-whitespace-cleanup-3.patch
http://www.linuxtux.org/~juhl/kernel_patches/fs_cifs_readdir-kfree-cleanup.patch
http://www.linuxtux.org/~juhl/kernel_patches/fs_cifs_readdir-cast-cleanup.patch
http://www.linuxtux.org/~juhl/kernel_patches/fs_cifs_readdir-whitespace-cleanup-final-bits.patch
(listed in the order they apply)
Short description of each patch will be in the email with that patch 
inline that will follow shortly.
