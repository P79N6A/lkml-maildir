Jeremy & all:
	Current xen kernel codes are in arch/x86/xen, but xen dynamic
irqchip (events.c) are common for other architectures such as IA64. We
are in progress with enabling pv_ops for IA64 now and want to reuse same
code, do we need to move the code to some place common? suggestions?
	Thanks, eddie
