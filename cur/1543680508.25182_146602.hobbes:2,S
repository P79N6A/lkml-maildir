Some more information:
The kernel messages "kernel: nfs: server 192.168.1.1 not responding,
timed out" do have some relationship with the EIO errors after all.
When I "ls" a directory for the first time (i.e. it's not in cache), I
get an EIO _every time_.  It's the getdents64() call which returns EIO.
The second and subsequent times I list that directory, the listing is
fine.  However if I pick another directory which isn't in cache yet,
getdents64() returns EIO.
A packet trace shows something interesting: duplicate requests.
In this case, I see four (4) READDIRPLUS requests with identical XIDs.
Ethereal says that all four are sent in 0.04 seconds.
Then I see four replies, of course with identical XIDs too.  The
replies all have status OK.  But four duplicate requests is mighty
suspicious.
