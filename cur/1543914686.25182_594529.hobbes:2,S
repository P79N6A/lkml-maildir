I see.  So you take the fault, disassemble the instruction, see that its
another CPU's vmcall instruction, and then replace it with the current
CPU's vmcall?

No, the point is that you're supposed to work out which hypervisor it is
from the signature in leaf 0, and then the hypervisor can put anything
it wants in the other leaves.
