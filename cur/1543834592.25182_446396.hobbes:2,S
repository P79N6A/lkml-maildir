We have more than enough precedence for poking the bridge that comes as
part of addon cards.  As long as the code makes sure it never pokes a bridge
of the same type that is not on the card (and I don't have the code in front
of me right now to check whether it's true) we can keep this code.  Please
make sure to add a big comment that explains what is going on in detail
and why it's okay in this special case.
