	I've written a 2.4 kernel module where I'm trying to walk and
record all of the physical memory contents in an x86 system. I have the
following code fragment that does it but I suspect I'm missing a portion
of the memory:
unsigned long memory_address = PAGE_OFFSET;
struct sysinfo RC_sys_info;
si_meminfo(&RC_sys_info);
while (__pa(memory_address) < RC_sys_info.totalram * PAGE_SIZE)
{
	/* Read and record memory contents here. */
	memory_address += 4;
}
Is there a better way to record all of the contents of physical memory
since what I have above doesn't seem to get everything?
