2 fragments of 1024 bytes = 11.6ms
15.1ms is the maximum time difference between 
2 consecutive write() to /dev/dsp and 307 times the time diff was
greater than 11.6ms , therefore there were 307 sound drop outs.
I use my usual bench ( 
http://www.gardena.net/benno/linux/latencytest0.3.tgz
 )
the tableis generated by: 
./runalltests filesize    ( for filesize (in bytes) use a size of at least 2
times your RAM to avoid caching.

Mybe the cause is that , issuing read and writes in sequence , cause your kernel
to respond in more smoothly, because massive writes get interrupted by the read.

ok, I will net you know, but I think your patches are not the definitive cure
of the high-latency problems, due to the kernel locking issue.
