   Additionally, where is this system tick thing? You make it sound like
   its a register in the cpu, and while the Ultra-III may have one, I'm
   unaware of a system/bus tick register on intel chips. Is it in some
   semi-documented MSR?
It's in a register on Ultra-III.  The whole point of this
conversation, if you read my initial postings, is that
"this should have been specified in the x86 architecture"
I know full well it isn't currently :-)
