Why not improve slightly devfs to have subdirectories such as "cdroms" (by
classes of devices ["it's a CDROM"], not classes of interfaces ["it's a
cdrom which you plug through USB"]), which would contain symlinks to the
directories which might hold cdrom devices ? 
(ie : /dev/cdroms having the following symlinks : 
        /dev/ide/cd
    	/dev/sr
	/dev/usb/cd
	...
)
Now, a program wanting to enumerate cdroms would just do something in the
lines of 
    for cddir in readdir("/dev/cdrom"):
	for cd in readdir(cddir):
	   #do something useful
Whoopla, this is pretty much static, so it may very well belong to the tar
solution, devfsd or an init script.
