I don't need to REmux, but I don't want to bother setting up the routing 
manually at all.  I think the GPIO management stuff can do it properly 
on my behalf, given the information we have to acquire to get the GPIO 
API to work in the first place.
Kind of like with request_irq() and enable_irq().  The driver is saying, 
"I don't care what's actually behind this interrupt source X, I just 
want it routed over to me".  If we commit to hiding the muxing behind 
the API, instead of defining a new, parallel API,  we get that kind of 
mentality for GPIO as well.
That's all.  Go forth and code.  :)
