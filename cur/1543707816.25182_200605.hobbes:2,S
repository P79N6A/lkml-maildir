Well, I have NEVER had a stack overflow, but then it is only a few lines. 
Likewise the assertions I think can go in favor of BUG and friends.
The timestamping I added at a time when the alternative that was suggested was 
LTT, which, at the time did not even come close to touching what I needed to do. 
  The timestamp code is designed to catch things that can only be observed when 
running close to real speed.  Especially on SMP systems, relative arrival times 
at spinlocks and friends can be very useful.  Would there be less objection if 
we removed the configure option for it ;)
