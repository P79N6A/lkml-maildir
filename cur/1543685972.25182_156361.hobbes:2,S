In my case, we use neither of them.

yes.  The device is reported as
scsi0 : Adaptec AIC7XXX EISA/VLB/PCI SCSI HBA DRIVER, Rev 6.2.8
        <Adaptec aic7890/91 Ultra2 SCSI adapter>
        aic7890/91: Ultra2 Wide Channel A, SCSI Id=7, 32/253 SCBs

Well, there's a tulip based network board and one symbios SCSI controller
(ncr53c8xx driver) in the system.  But since the '(scsi0:A:9:0): Locking
max tag count at 64' message always indicates 'scsi0', I think it has to
do with aic7xxx.
