But I am quite unable to do so if the code may break compatibility of
other pieces of code and just turn the cathedral of the bazar into the
temple of the mess-up. When a shared interface is changed, common rules
about compatibility issues must be followed.

There is plenty of place in the source files to provide minimal
documentation that proves that the developper designed his changes 
or at least thought enough about before writing the code.

That's not overdesign in my opinion, but the simple way software guys
apply since decade to waste the newly available resources provided by
new hardware. Just a way for Linux to stay in fashion. ;-)

Bad code when reasonnable code was possible given a reasonnable delay is
catastrophic since you will have to deal with shit for a long time and the
cost will be far greater than the time that had been required to develop
the code the right way.
Speaking of code that involves shared interfaces, the right order is to
document, discuss the specs and the consequences of the changes, _prior_
to implementing a single line of code.
