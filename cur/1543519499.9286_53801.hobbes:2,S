Of course. But isn't it the point of the new resource management stuff
to have a complete list of used resources? That's why I use
allocate_resource, and when I did that piece of code I copied it mostly from
Martin Mares code...
Anyway, I'm open to suggestions, but so far noone has told me
how to do it right...
This code might probably better be moved to the PCI fixup routines...

Isn't this what allocate_resource is for?
