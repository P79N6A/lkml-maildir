Subject: Module XXX can not be unloaded
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

My logs are filled with this message, in spite of:
 1 - nothing is trying to unload these modules
 2 - my kernels are built w/o module unloading because I have never yet 
     found any module which *could* be unloaded by the new code.
I presume this should be replaced by a message saying that module 
unloading is not configured, and that it should only happen when a program 
tries to unload a module, rather than generating many lines of meaningless 
log babble.

  Having the feature freeze for Linux 2.5 on Hallow'een is appropriate,
since using 2.5 kernels includes a lot of things jumping out of dark
corners to scare you.
