VFS: Cannot open root device "302" or 03:02
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:02
Since I've used "make oldconfig" and:
loke:loke:/usr/src/test$ diff my-2.5.6-pre2-.config my-2.5.6-pre3-.config

< CONFIG_IDE_TASK_IOCTL=y

< # IDE chipset support/bugfixes

> # IDE chipset support

< # CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_FORCED is not set
only show enforced differences, I could boot into 2.5.6-pre2 tonight (about 6 hours from now) and dump whatever info you need - if it is deemed necessary. Otherwise I'll just enjoy the -ac series until a -preX turns up that is bootable.
