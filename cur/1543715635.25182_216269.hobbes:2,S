Yes, I know, it's a damn cheap eth card and I should get it replaced :)
Besides that, this card works just fine with 2.4.25 while it refuses to  
work on a recent 2.6 kernel. I tried 2.6.5 and even  
2.6.5-rc2-mm2-broken-out with no luck.
The card is correctly recognized but the kernel refuses to transmit any  
packet:
8139too Fast Ethernet driver 0.9.27
eth0: RealTek RTL8139 at 0xe0821000, MAC_ADDR_REMOVED, IRQ 5
eth0:  Identified 8139 chip type 'RTL-8139C'
eth0: link up, 100Mbps, full-duplex, lpa 0x45E1
eth0: Transmit timeout, status 0c 0005 c07f media 10.
eth0: Tx queue start entry 4  dirty entry 0.
eth0:  Tx descriptor 0 is 0008a03c. (queue head)
eth0:  Tx descriptor 1 is 0008a03c.
eth0:  Tx descriptor 2 is 0008a03c.
eth0:  Tx descriptor 3 is 0008a03c.
Someone told me to play around with the driver options but the machine is  
in production and I cannot play much with reboots :/
Any help would be very appreciated.
