Thanks for your anwser.
I loaded all modules:
Module                  Size  Used by
uhci_hcd               30928  0 
speedtch               14096  0 
crc32                   4320  1 speedtch
tdfx                   37096  0 
pcspkr                  3300  0 
tdfxfb                 12456  0 
cfbimgblt               3136  1 tdfxfb
then configured all necessary files.
All fine. Nice green lights.
But when I ran pppd, I got:
pppd: /usr/lib/pppd/plugins/pppoatm.so:
 cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
pppd: Couldn't load plugin /usr/lib/pppd/plugins/pppoatm.so
I looked for it and noticed it was in /usr/lib/pppd/2.4.20/,
so I linked it; but then I got:
pppd: libatm.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
pppd: Couldn't load plugin /usr/lib/pppd/plugins/pppoatm.so
Looks like I missed some piece of installation...
Could you help me?
Grazie,
*Guldo*
