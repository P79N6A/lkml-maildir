At the risk of being severely flamed, I have a very simple question.  If I
wanted to build a kernel on a redhat 5.1 machine and install it properly,
how would I go about doing this.  I have tried the normal technique of
"make xconfig", configure the kernel, then "make dep ; make clean ; make
zlilo" but the kernel gets deposited into the wrong area (/ instead of
/boot).  While examining /boot, I realized that there is a lot more junk
in there than just System.map and vmlinuz.  Should I just place the new
kernel and System.map over the old or what?  Again, I am used to Slackware
systems so this is a little strange for me.  Please help.  Thanks.
