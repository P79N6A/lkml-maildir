Hrm, weird.. because it should. Here are the numbers I posted
previously:
The measurements I get (in cycles):
             enable interrupts (STI)   disable interrupts (CLI)   local CMPXCHG
IA32 (P4)    112                        82                         26
x86_64 AMD64 125                       102                         19
So both AMD64 and IA32 should be improved.
So why those improvements are not shown in your test ? A few possible
causes:
- Do you have any CONFIG_DEBUG_* options activated ? smp_processor_id()
  may end up being more expensive in these cases.
- Rounding error.. you seem to round at 0.1ms, but I keep the values in
  cycles. The times that you get (1.1ms) seems strangely higher than
  mine, which are under 1000 cycles on a 3GHz system (less than 333ns).
  I guess there is both a ms - ns error there and/or not enough
  precision in your numbers.
