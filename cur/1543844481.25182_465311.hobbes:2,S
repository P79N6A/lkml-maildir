yes,
   however git users are people who plan on following every kernel version for a 
while, tarball users are people who grab a copy of the kernel once in a while 
(probably not every version). for the tarball users they would have to grab 
multiple patches to get from the last thing that they have to whatever is 
current. and frankly they may not (and probably should not) trust the last thing 
that they have, as in many cases it's a distro patched kernel that may not be 
compatable with the vanilla kernel.
people who start downloading every revision should start useing git or patches, 
but not everyone needs it.
also people could be behind a firewall that prevents git from working properly, 
for them tarballs and patches are the right way of doing things.
