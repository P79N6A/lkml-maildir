Well, ok, implicit namespace reference will take advantage of it
if it happens.

I agree that implicit vs explicit parameters is a topic for discussion.
From what you see from my patch, I vote for implicit ones in this case :)
I was talking about layers because they imply changing more code,
and usually imply adding more parameters to functions and passing these
additional parameters to next layers.
In "routing" code it goes from routing entry points, to routing cache, to
general FIB functions, to table-specific code (FIB hash).
These additional parameters bloat the code to some extent.
Sometimes it's possible to save here and there by fetching the parameter
(namespace pointer) indirectly from structures you already have at hand,
but it can't be done universally.
One of the properties of implicit argument which I especially like
is that both input and output paths are absolutely symmetric in how
the namespace pointer is extracted.
