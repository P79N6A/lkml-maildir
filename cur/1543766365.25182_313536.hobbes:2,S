Sorry to bring this up again but, take a look at the patch by 
ecashin@coraid.com titled "[PATCH] aoe 5/12: don't try to free null 
bufpool" 
http://grmso.net:8090/commit/03347936afcba990525736ae39daa13f643eac5f/diff/fa83c2ddd4293bd8bcaeeaf14bfdbf2fbe810420/
That's exactely the reason why the patch I submitted should be applied, to 
avoid having to do such checks all over the place in other code and 
instead just do it in one location. With this patch in place, the patch to 
aoedev.c would not have been needed.
Or am I still misunderstanding something.
