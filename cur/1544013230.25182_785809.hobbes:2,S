I'm seeing the following warning message during a kernel build:
  CC [M]  drivers/media/video/gspca/gspca.o
drivers/media/video/gspca/gspca.c:1811: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type
The root cause appears to be a missed prototype change in a conversion from
ioctl to unlocked_ioctl - in struct file_operations, the former is an int,
but the latter is a long.  So we clean it up.
I have to admit not having checked deeply for second-order effects, but the
kernel builds without warnings and the result works for me.  The only other
use of __video_ioctl2 I can see is in drivers/media/video/ivtv/ivtv-ioctl.c,
and there it's used as a return value from a function already defined to return
a long, so we save an int->long cast...
