Several have already dealt with why this won't work, so I won't add to
it...

How does "make zImage" or "make bzImage" know what the root device is
anyway? Remember that the machine we're compiling on may not be the
target machine - and we may even be compiling a kernel with which to
netboot some machines without any drives of their own...
Best wishes from Riley.
