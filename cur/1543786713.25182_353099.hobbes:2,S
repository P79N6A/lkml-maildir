Point taken. That is the reason I have excluded the dst patches in this
patchset.  The problem with dst.__refcount stays and we should probably look
for some other approach rather than thinking per-cpu/per-node counters for 
this. 
But the patch in question now is net_device refcount. Surely that doesn't
affect webservers with many dst entries.

Benchmarks could be wrong, but we don't control what people run. 
And there are apps which use lo (for whatever reason) :(.
