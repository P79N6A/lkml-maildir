I'm actually interested in:
1. CF wear-levelling algorithms: how good or bad is it?
2. How does CF implement block mapping, does it store the mapping table 
on-flash or in memory, does it build it by scanning, how scalable are 
those algorithms.
3. Does CF perform bad erasable blocks hadling transparently when new 
bad eraseblocks appear.
4. How tolerant CF to powrer-offs.
5. Is there a Garbage Collector in CF and how clever/stupid is it.
etc.
I've heard CF does not have good characteristics in the above mentioned 
aspects, but still, it would be interesting to know details. I'm not 
going to use CFs, but as I'm working with flashes, I'm just interested. 
It'd help me explaining people why it is bad to use CF for more serious 
applications then those just storing pictures.
