Building a better chassis can be a challenge when the threat model really
*does* include attacks by a well-funded TLA.

The FBI did an *initial* entry to survey the hardware, and then a total of
*five* other entries before they actually installed it.  Note the technical
and legal requirements required on the KLS (it had to, among other things,
capture PGP passphrases but *not* anything that was typed online).

See above.  Though I *will* note that several years ago, a Department
of Justice filing regarding the use of wiretaps and similar tools reported
that in every single case that the FBI encountered encryption, it in fact
didn't stop the FBI from getting the info it was looking for.  Presumably,
they either used Scarfo-type devices, or they rolled somebody for the key.
They never *did* break Anthony Pellicano's PGP key, as far as I know....
