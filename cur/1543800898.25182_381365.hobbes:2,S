Depends entirely on the purpose. __getname uses the "names_cache" slab
and allocates PATH_MAX sized chunks. It is mainly supposed to be used
for temporary storage of an entire path.

Most callers use getname(), which also does the string length sanity
checks and then copies the path from userland memory.
