Hi,
It is off-topic, but I couldn't find the answer by Googling.
I have installed 2.6.0-test2 and module-init-tools-0.9.13-pre2 on 
my RedHat 9 system.
Now I have two problem:  First one is that mount does not load
needed modules automatically, so refuses to mount if the module
for the filesystem is not loaded.  When I load it and retry, it
mounts.
The other problem is that, in the old era, I would simply put a
line of 'alias char-major-10-144 nvram' in my /etc/modules.conf,
and reading from /dev/nvram would load the module and work.  Now
there is a line for that in auto-generated /etc/modprobe.conf, 
but 'cat /dev/nvram' errs:
	cat: /dev/nvram: No such device
The same problem is with some other modules, including loop.  But 
some drivers, like rtc and cdrom have been loaded themselves.
Help is welcome,
behdad
PS.  Please keep me CCed

If you do a job too well, you'll get stuck with it.
