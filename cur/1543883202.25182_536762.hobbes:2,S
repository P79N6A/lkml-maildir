Lovely regression.
If you have time, there are a couple of things to do here:
1: Watch virtual terminal #1 while starting that appliction.  ie: in an
   xterm (assuming you can open one) do
	sleep 5; mozilla
   then do a quick alt-shift-F1 before the sleep expires.  See if
   anything comes up on the console.
2: get netconsole working: see Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt
3: Performa a git bisection search, find the buggy patch.  This is quite a
   lot of work, and I hate asking people to do it because we don't (afaik)
   have any particularly good documentation on how to perform it.
