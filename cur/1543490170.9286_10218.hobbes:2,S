Maybe because you are using old unsupported /usr/include headers which
came with old unsupported version of libc?
The industry leader (i.e. Red Hat) use new glibc which has correct
headers. My personal advice -- either use Red Hat or do everything
manually properly, starting from the bootsector and ending with
applications.
