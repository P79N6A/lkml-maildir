Please don't give up . :-)
I need to know which statement  in EC0.UPDT that could trigger the
problem.
That is very important to understand the problem correctly.
If we cannot find out that statement , then, I will dout the testing
results that guiding us to here.

This is still my assumption that some AML code needed to be avoided
in suspend/resume, I need data support. So, we need to dig more in 
EC0.UPDT.

If BIOS behaviors NOT correctly , then everything can happen.

It could be. But there should have something that trigger it.

Yes, you can try that.
