I'm looking at __block_write_full_page() for guidance.  The situation
here is similar to writing a page where all the bufferheads are clean.
__block_write_full_page() always calls set_page_writeback(page), and
then, if no I/O is initiated, immediately calls
end_page_writeback(page).
I'll put together a patch for testing.

Shaggy
