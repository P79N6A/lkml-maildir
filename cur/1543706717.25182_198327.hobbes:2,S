Sorry, I think I mangled it like "hda=ata66" or "ide0=udma66" instead when I
tried. I just rechecked with "ide0=ata66", and I confirm that it works (it
uses UDMA100). BTW, wouldn't it be more appropriate to use something such as
"udma4" or "80pin" or something else which would be more intuitive than
"ata66" ?
Thanks for your help and particularly for your quick response, Bart.
Willy
