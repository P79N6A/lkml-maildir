That assumes that one can do a printk and not run into a lock.  Far better 
IMNSHO is to provide a simple way to get it from gdb.  One can then even provide 
a gdb macro to print the relevant source line and its surrounds.  I my lighter 
moments I call this the comefrom macro :)  In my kgdb it would look like:
l * kgdb_info.called_from
