Is it a typo on "fsys entries is even"?
If not, then this change log is misleading. It is the instruction
patch list of FSYS_RETURN that can potentially cause other data
structures to be out of alignment. And number of FSYS_RETURN call
site will not necessarily match number of fsys entry.

Otherwise, the patch looks fine to me.
