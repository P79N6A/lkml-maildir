ext2fs should be quite safe in the presence of media errors.  We have
tested this using a dummy device driver which generates random IO
errors.  
The one thing missing from your bug report was the symbolic OOPS output
generated by ksymoops.  What we really need is the full stack trace
matched against your System.map.
Cheers,
 Stephen
