When trying to boot w/ ACPI the transition fails and the box hobbles
along to different degrees. Normally the interrupt routing is bad and a
scsi or network card fails to init. 
Without ACPI the system boots fine. SMIs are still clobbered, but
they're less critical.
But really, ACPI (and SMIs) should "just work".  ;)
