Timer is already initialized few lines above in the code. If you'll look
through fs/ncpfs/inode.c history, you'll find that I already asked once
for removing this redundant timer initialization, but unfortunately it
found its way to the tree again :-(
I prefer having init_timer() and timeout_tm setup separate, as now
I can safely call del_timer in shutdown without having to test
whether I'm in UDP or TCP code...
