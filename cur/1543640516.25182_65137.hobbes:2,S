Subject: [PATCH] mremap corrupts freed vma
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/8/19/233

My tricksy accounting code in mremap's move_vma assumed 2.4 behaviour
in do_munmap, which preserved vma: but 2.5 splitvma may substitute it.
Showed up as Committed_AS growing each time kernel built with kallsyms;
but more seriously, it was writing to an area already kmem_cache_freed.
Patch against 2.5.31 or today's BK: please apply before others corrupted!
