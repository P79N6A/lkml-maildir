This is not has hard as you might think, I am constantly dealing with BO
or netbus infections.  Windows users can often be tricked into running
things. 
Or in one case NT and 95 on a lan with networking open (oops) attackers
just mounted the drives and installed 30 copies of netbus.
Improper setup on either OS will cause problems.. no reason to single us
out.
