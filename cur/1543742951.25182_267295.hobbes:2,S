Generates rejects against Sam's tree and appears to be unrelated to FRV,
yes?
I'd prefer that this be worked through Sam's tree as a separate enhancement
please.
+ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO
+CFLAGS		+= -g -O1
+AFLAGS		+= -Wa,--gdwarf2
+ASFLAGS		+= -Wa,--gdwarf2
+else
Are you sure that all architectures want this?  And that their toolchains

that kgdb will continue to work correctly, etc?
I'm not...
