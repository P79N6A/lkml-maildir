You just described quilt & patch-scripts.
The problem with those is letting other people get access to it.  I guess
that could be fixed with a bit of scripting and rsyncing.
(I don't do that for -mm because -mm basically doesn't work for 99% of the
time.  Takes 4-5 hours to out a release out assuming that nothing's busted,
and usually something is).
