Subject: [PATCH 1/2] memcg: mem_cgroup->prev_priority protected by lock.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/2/21

Currently, mem_cgroup doesn't have own lock and almost its member doesn't need.
 (e.g. info is protected by zone lock, stat is per cpu variable)
However, there is one explict exception. mem_cgroup->prev_priorit need lock,
but doesn't protect.
Luckly, this is NOT bug because prev_priority isn't used for current reclaim code.
However, we plan to use prev_priority future again.
Therefore, fixing is better.
In addision, we plan to reuse this lock for another member.
Then "misc_lock" name is better than "prev_priority_lock".
