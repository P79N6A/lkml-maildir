Hi,
I was wondering; to ease the development of new drivers (see
subject-line) and all, wouldn't it be nice to have frameworks
available so that companies and others can focus more on the
driving of the hardware itself instead of all around it?
Speaking for myself, I got some things I like to implement but
am a bit hesitating since I'm such a lazy guy and not very
willing to spend too much time on finding out what is needed
where and why and all.
I hope I made myself clear since English is definitaly not my
native language.
