heh. Incidentally i was thinking about using KVM for automated testing. 
Important pieces of hardware should get an in-KVM simulator/emulator, 
that way developers who do not own that hardware can do functionality 
testing too. So basically the highest-quality drivers would have an 
"inverse driver" in KVM, which simulates the hardware. (that model is 
evidently useful to the hardware maker even for new hardware: it can 
then also be used to test the Linux compatibility and Linux performance 
of future planned releases of the hardware, etc.)
