Probably an interaction between the fact that the
VM tries to write out pages but reiserfs blocking
this because of write ordering constraints...
It should become better once reiserfs has a smart
->writepage() function that will push the "right"
page to disk and allows the system to continue
faster.
The fact that swap is full may also have something
to do with it, though on my tests here the system
continued to run fine with swap space filled up.

Rik
