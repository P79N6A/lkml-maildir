Look at the change history for keyboard.c:
[PATCH] fix magic sysrq on strange keyboards
Magic sysrq fails to work on many keyboards, particulary most of notebook
keyboards.  This patch fixes it.
The idea is quite simple: Discard the SysRq break code if Alt is still being
held down.  This way the broken keyboard can send the break code (or the user
with a normal keyboard can release the SysRq key) and the kernel waits until
the next key is pressed or the Alt key is released.
