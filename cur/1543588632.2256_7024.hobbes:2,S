I guess this is a leftover from the VIA buggy southbridge workaround hunt.
Code marked with "#if 0" and "#if 1" is usally under
development and subject to changes. 
Or left intentionally in "#if 0" to show the reader that we had
an wrong idea once, which seemed to be obviously correct (may be
from the docs) and we solved it with a different method, which is
not obvious or even not stated in the docs, but is the right one.
So we avoid stupid patches by leaving such things for reference.
In short: Don't care about new dead code too much, if it will be
   needed by a "#if 0" marked code section.
BTW: Which revision of gcc 3.0 do you use? I had no luck compiling
   it yet. Please answer in private to gcc issues.
