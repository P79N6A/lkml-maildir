Far be it for me to aid people in making binary only drivers, but one hack that
I did many years ago when I wrote the Data General C compiler was to make
external symbols into instruction patterns so that the library could be linked
with checking code that would not normally affect the speed of the unchecked
code.  For example to check R1 it might lay do something like:
	.long	__checkr1a
	.long	__checkr1b
	.long	__checkr1c
If the checking code was linked in, __checkr1a might be a PUSH R1 instruction,
__checkr1b might be an appropriate call instruction, __checkr1c might be a POP
R1 instruction.  If checking was not linked in, the __checkr1{a,b,c} would be
resolved to NOPs.  You could potentially do the same thing for UP/SMP, though
the variable instruction sizes on the x86 will make it tricky :-)
