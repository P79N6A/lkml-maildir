A question of little interest, since suing won't happen anyway.
The paid-for licences always include "This program may not
be useful for any purpose, we assume no reponsibility," and so on.

Nope.  Did anybody ever sue microsoft because windows crashed and ate
the disk, destroying valuable data?  Or for loss of productivity during
downtime?
It can't be done.  Forget about it.  Paying for a os might get you
