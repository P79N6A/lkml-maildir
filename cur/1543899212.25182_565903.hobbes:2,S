I was sure I copied lkml, but obviously something went wrong.

Thanks for the explanation. Now I get the overall picture of what
whould be done to load the firmware. I will try playing around with
the firmware.agent script, although I do not havfe the entire hotplug
package on my system, but probably this should work with a bit of
manual bash scripting.

What do you mean by "recent systems" ? Is it distro dependent or
kernel dependent ?

Actually I don't have hotplug/udev. That is why I am thinking of some
basic manual firmware loading. I switched from 2.4.33.3 kernel, where
such toold were not needed (I guess).

I will take a closer look at the timeout value. It is quite
uncomfortable for me right now to switch to the new kernel, because I
loose internet connectivity at that time :)

I tried some basic copy, but received permission denied even though I
was root. Perhaps I was trying at the wrong location. I'll get back
with more info on Monday.
Thanks for your help.
