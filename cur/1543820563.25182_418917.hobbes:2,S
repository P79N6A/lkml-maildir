I considered this (as part of the original code to allow override of the 
skip for cases where moving a task will make it the best priority on the 
CPU -- NB no extra caveats about finding the best priority task which 
meets the criteria) and decided that it wasn't worth worrying about as 
the complexity of the code required to handle it would be considerable.
Also, because we are actually moving a bigger load than is required to 
balance the total weighted loads on the two queues, there's an argument 
that we should move the smallest one that meets the requirement.  With 
these conflicting arguments, it seems best just to move the first one we 
find that meets the criteria and is movable.
Load balancing is probabilistic at best and extra effort trying to be 
perfect will be wasted.  This is even more the case when you take into 
account the fact that as soon as you release the locks on the queues 
everything is highly likely to change anyway.
I figured that this code is consistent with the original load balancing 
code in this regard.
