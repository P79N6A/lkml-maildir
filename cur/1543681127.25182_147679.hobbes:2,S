Ah, but as the fraction approaches 1, you'll find that you are
asymptotically approaching the point where you can't handle the load
_regardless_ of epoll overhead.

It scales according to the amount of work pending, which means that it
doesn't take any _more_ time than actually doing the pending work.
(This assumes you use epoll appropriately; there are many ways to use
epoll which don't have this property).
That was always the complaint about select() and poll(): they dominate
the run time for large numbers of connections.  epoll, on the other
hand, will always be in the noise relative to other work.
If you want a formula for slides :), time_polling/time_working is O(1)
with epoll, but O(N) with poll() & select().
