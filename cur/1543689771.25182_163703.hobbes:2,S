Yes. We can surely use div_long_long_rem from div64 in place of defining 
this again. This kind of code is already there in the existing ia32 timer
code too. I will try and come up with a cleanup patch to replace all 
these individual asm div statements.

Interesting. Is this casting to generate proper mul instruction
some sort of C standard or is it a gcc feature. I just want to
make sure doing this way won't break on some other compiler 
(or on some other version of gcc itself).
