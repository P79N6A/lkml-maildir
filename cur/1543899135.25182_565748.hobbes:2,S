 Lowering dirty_ration just leads to more imbalanced write-speed for
the three dd's. Even when lowering the number to 0, the hich load
stays.
 Now, on another experiment I mounted the FS with "sync". And now the
load stays below/around 3. No more "pdflush" daemons going wild. And
the responsiveness is good, with no drops.
 My question is now: is there a parameter that one can use to force
immediate writeout for every process. This may hurt overall performance
of the system, but might really help my situation. Setting dirty_ratio
to 0 does not seem to do it.
Cheers
Martin
