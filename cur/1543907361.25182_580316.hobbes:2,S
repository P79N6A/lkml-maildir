Nope, you would just fulfill in a completely generic way all outstanding
requests when you are ready. All requests are all nicely grouped and
visible in sysfs. There would be no need of coding your own device
specific rebind. No timeout is needed or wanted, all requests would stay
until userspace has handled them successfully or canceled them.
