True the client can't assume the files are the same, but it can't assume
they're different either.

This is not so bad because the RFC also says:
  "fsid" is the file system identifier for the filesystem containing
  the file; "fileid" is a number that uniquely identifies the file
  within its filesystem
Note the "uniquely".  But why do we not make use of the fsid value?
