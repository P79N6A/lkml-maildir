IIRC, the original deadlock call chain was when SELinux tried to set the
security attribute on a newly created file from the post_create hooks. 
Looked something like (SELinux) post_create -> reiser_setxattr -> ... ->
open_xa_dir -> reiserfs_mkdir -> d_instantiate ->
selinux_d_instantiate() -> inode_doinit_with_dentry() ->
reiser_getxattr.  First reported in
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108625196416654&w=2, but
that only addressed the deadlock issue, not the permission checking
problem.
