Well, it depends on what the mapping is using ->private for.
In the case of ext2, ext3 and (soon) reiserfs mappings, ->private
is only used for pagecache pages which were written to with write(2).
But for other filesystems, basically all pagecache pages have
buffers at present, so I exaggerate.  But as filesystems migrate
to using direct-to-BIO reads, the situation gets better.
It might be useful to buffer-strip written-to pages as well, if
a clean way of doing that presents itself.  Maybe in refill_inactive
or something.

I broke it in my five-minute thought-coding exercise.  By removing
page->index.
