OK, so that means I'm not getting it.
So what does your patch do that mine doesn't?
It removes the dependency of running (=task_current()) from on_rq
(p->se.on_rq).
So how can a current task not be on the runqueue?
Only sched.c:dequeue_task() and sched_fair.c:account_entity_dequeue()
set on_rq to 0, the only one changing rq->curr is schedule().
So the only scheme I can come up with is that we did dequeue p (on_rq ==
0), but we didn't yet schedule so rq->curr == p.
Is this how you ended up with your previuos analysis that it must be due
to a hole introduced by double_lock_balance()?
Because now we can seemingly call deactivate_task() and put_prev_task()
in non-atomic fashion, but by placing the put_prev_task() before the
load balance calls we should avoid doing that.
So what else is going on... /me puzzled
