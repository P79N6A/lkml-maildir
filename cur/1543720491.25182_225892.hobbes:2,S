Hi,
Here are three bugfixes for the USB code against 2.6.7-rc3.  They do the
following:
	- fix deadlock in usbfs
	- fix bug and enable the pwc USB driver to build
	- fix bugs in cyberjack driver to enable device to work.
The first one is the most serious, but the others are good things to
have fixed in the final 2.6.7 release.
Please pull from:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/usb-fix-2.6
Patches will be posted to linux-usb-devel as a follow-up thread for
those who want to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
