Well... since you just proved that you don't understand the problem,
I'd hazard a guess that uClibc is also broken, as well as glibc.
Here's how the ABI specifies that pread() shall take its arguments:
asmlinkage ssize_t sys_pread64(unsigned int fd, char *buf, size_t count,
				loff_t pos)
fd	arg0
buf	arg1
count	arg2
pos	arg4 & arg5
Here's what __LONG_LONG_PAIR does:
fd	arg0
buf	arg1
count	arg2
pos(HI)	arg3
pos(LO)	arg4
