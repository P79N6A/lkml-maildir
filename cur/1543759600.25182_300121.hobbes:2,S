By code inspection, I see an issue with this patch
	[PATCH 10/13] remove aggressive idle balancing
Why are we removing cpu_and_siblings_are_idle check from active_load_balance?
In case of SMT, we  want to give prioritization to an idle package while
doing active_load_balance(infact, active_load_balance will be kicked
mainly because there is an idle package) 
Just the re-addition of cpu_and_siblings_are_idle check to 
active_load_balance might not be enough. We somehow need to communicate 
this to move_tasks, otherwise can_migrate_task will fail and we will 
never be able to do active_load_balance.
thanks,
