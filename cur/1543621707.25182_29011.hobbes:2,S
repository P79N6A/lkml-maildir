We already clean up fasync structures on close, its the drivers 
responsibility to do so.  If you wanted to be more strict you could do
a similar helper call in the other closing callback for each fd close.

Any reason for not just caching the 32bit task ident field ? Using the
slightly confusingly p->parent_exec_id, which is basically a 32bit process
ident for example
