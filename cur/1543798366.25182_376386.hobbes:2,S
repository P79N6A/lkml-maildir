But that should only happen (shut off a router and/or firewall) in cases
where we now completely deadlock and never recover, including shutting off
the router and firewall, because they don't have enough memory to recv
packets either.

I guess IPSEC would be a critical socket too, in that case. Sure
there is nothing we can do if the daemon insists on allocating lots
of memory...

True it will have holes. I think something that is complementary and
would be desirable is to simply limit the amount of in-flight writeout
that things like NFS allows (or used to allow, haven't checked for a
while and there were noises about it getting better).
