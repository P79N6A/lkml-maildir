This is why Ingo, Nick and myself think that a tweak to the heavily field 
tested current cpu scheduler is best for 2.6 rather than any gutting and 
replacement of the interactivity estimator (which even though this scheme is 
simple and easy to understand, it clearly is an example of). Given that we 
have a "2.6 forever" policy, it also means any significant cpu scheduler 
rewrite, even just of the interactivity estimator, is nigh on impossible to 
implement.
