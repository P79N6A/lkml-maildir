   The ones which were patched were audio/cs4231.o, char/envctrl.o,
   and char/sab82532.o. Are these any that you are working on?
   None of the others were tagged as being "broken"
If my drivers are broken, please report the problem to me (the
maintainer) so I can work on fixing them if they are still broken
in my tree.  Thanks.
Later,
