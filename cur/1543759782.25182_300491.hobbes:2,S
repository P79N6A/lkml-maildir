I have it fixed in my tree, but not pushed out yet because of lack of
testing.
In general I track all i386 changes that make sense for modern systems
and 64bit, but sometimes merging takes some time.
However given the flood of bugs in the i386 code I'm starting to have
doubts again if all these changes were really a good idea.
However x86-64 has to be bug-to-bug compatible to i386, so there
is not much choice.
