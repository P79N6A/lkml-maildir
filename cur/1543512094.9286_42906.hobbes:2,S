Yes. Just do it the RedHat way: Install, and be done with it. No need to
tell any newbie about /dev. Works 99% of the time (field tested around
here). For the not-so-newbie, tell them that /dev contains files that
represent devices, and that they can be handled with the same tools she
knows for regular files, if a bit of care is excercised.

Now you tell him that he can't find out what the name of a disk is if it
isn't on line. And explain carefully how to manage the symlink farm in
/devices, so /dev can stay squeaky clean. Give step by step instructions on
patching the kernel to change permissions on the modem, and how to build
and install the new kernel, and rebooting into it, so his kid sister
doesn't stay online all day (phone is charged by the minute here). Don't
forget to mention that it might come handy having several kernels around
with different permissions on devices, just in case. Also, tell him how to
clone a device for the case /dev/sdc is allowed for everybody (happens to
be the removable Zip disk), while /dev/sda isn't (the main drive).
If/when he digests all this, prepare for the question about how to
recompile the kernel so his $HOME is closed to outsiders, and how to
reconfigure the kernel for some new user.

Ever heard of MAKEDEV?
All this is just changing one mess (/dev) for another mess of the very same
size (symlink farm), only much worse.
