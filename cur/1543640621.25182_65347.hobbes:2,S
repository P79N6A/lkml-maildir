Ah, that explains why we seemed to be talking past each other. For
2.4.x, def_blk_fops.open() will bump the reference count, but in 2.5.x
it won't. So in 2.5.x, fs/devfs/base.c:devfs_open() shouldn't drop the
refcount after def_blk_fops.open() returns.

Huh? Of course not! All I'm saying is that if you use devfs, the
optimisation will short-circuit the lookups.
