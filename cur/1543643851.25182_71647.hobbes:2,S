i agree that this is okay, as an added mechanism. Nevertheless this does
not eliminate the 'box locks up for seconds' (or even minutes) situation.  
No matter how large the PID range, unless we make the PID range truly
infinite (64 or 128 bits ought to be enough), there's always going to be
PID allocation collision, and it's a frequent application pattern to
allocate threads in a row. We cannot stick our heads into the sand, a
O(N^2) algorithm will only get worse with time, the problem will not go
away magically.
and i dont think it adds any significant complexity. The fastpath is still
comparable, and another benefit of idtags is the elimination of
for_each_process() [and for_each_threads()] loops.
