Well, your patch was the correct direction, but it did not completely reach 
the target... :-( The 'monotonic_base' variable in the PMTMR stores its value 
in microseconds. So the 'base' value has to be convertet to nanoseconds, 
too...
A patch that corrects that is attached...
(Btw. another solution would be to store all the values in nanoseconds by 
replacing the cyc2us function with a cyc2ns function...)

I think you are right, but the sched_clock->monotonic_clock patch helped us 
finding the problems in the monotonic_clock_pmtmr() function... ;-)
