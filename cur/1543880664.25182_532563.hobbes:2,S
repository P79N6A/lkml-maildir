Integrity protection requires information flow control; you can't
protect a high integrity process from being corrupted by a low integrity
process if you don't control the flow of information.  Plenty of attacks
take the form of a untrusted process injecting data that will ultimately
be used by a more trusted process with a surprising side effect.
And you can't do information flow control if you can't provide global
and persistent protection of the data, which requires labeling it and
preserving that label for its lifetime.

They aren't truly independent; the composition may lead to surprising
results where each individual program is "confined" exactly as you
specified, but in combination, one is able to corrupt the higher
integrity subject by actions taken by the lower integrity subject.
Particularly in the fun area of publically writable directories, where
pathnames are largely useless as an indicator.
