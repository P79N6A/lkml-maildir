A patch that generated offsets at compilation time would be
a superiour solution. As a matter of fact, I was thinking
about adopting DaveM's script that generates offsets for sparc.
He does it a make dep time in order to prevent mass rebuilds
on every recompile. See arch/sparc64/kernel/check_asm.sh
and the corresponding Makefile. Good thing you mentioned that
and saved me a bunch of work :)
Please keep poking Marcelo with it, and it's a great pity that
you did not before 2.4.18 came out.

Yes, I noticed. However, offsets are all chained together,
so all other offsets become correct. But once again, having
them all generated automatically is preferable.

Certainly, I do. I worked around the partitions part with "obvious"
fixup:
-       if (ioctl_by_bdev(bdev, HDIO_GETGEO, (unsigned long)geo);
+       if (ioctl_by_bdev(bdev, HDIO_GETGEO, (unsigned long)geo))
-       data = read_dev_sector(bdev, inode->label_block*blocksize, &sect);
+       data = read_dev_sector(bdev, info->label_block*blocksize, &sect);
But that code did not look too good, in particular it was
not checking return codes. So, it was on my TODO list to
clean it up.
