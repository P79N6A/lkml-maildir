Subject: [PATCH] add bootmem failure warning
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

__alloc_bootmem_core() has a couple of BUG_ON()'s.  Since the handlers
aren't set up this early, if you hit it, you just get along stream of
"Unknown Interrupt" messages.  It would be very nice to have a little
bit more information when something has decided to BUG() out this
early.
