IOW the "pipe" above is in fact just a "handle" of a kernel-internal
buffer (of one page) and the two fd's can be used to tell sys-calls to
read from or write into the buffer. But it is much faster because it
avoids real copying of the data into a user-space buffer and out of the
user-space buffer since the kernel can manipulate the underlying data
directly as a typical implementation of the above code does (i.e. use
read(2) and write(2) instead of the two splice(2) calls).
Uuuuuh, real zero-copy seems possible.
