I can agree with You about cache optimization, but the fact is that the patch,
for RQ < limit introduced only a memory load ( 4 bytes ) and memory write ( 4
bytes ).
It is the wrong way to get off the patch ( benchmarks first, cache issues
after, ...) that driven me to this kind of defence of the patch.
As I've stated into the message opening this thread I'm all but sure that
the RQs that makes the patch to boost, will be usual in real world.
As I've reported to Linus, Alan and Ingo, the better way to reject the patch
is the one that state that the code bloat ( 200 lines ) is not sustained
by a real gain under normal loads.
Cheers,
