Which processors have no such instructions but are SMP-capable?

Clusters are not my problem.  They require additional software.  And
NUMA machines maybe be requiring a certain sequence in which the
operations must be performed and the hardware should take care of the
rest.
I don't really care what the final implementation will be like.  For
UP and SMP machines I definitely want to have as much as possible at
user-level.  If you need a special libpthread for NUMA machines, so be
it.
