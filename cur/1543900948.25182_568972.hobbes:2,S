I asked you not to say that ...
Can somebody using LinuxBIOS or OpenFirmware please do
dd if=/dev/mem bs=1 count=1 skip=$((0x417)) | hexdump
 - and -
dd if=/dev/mem bs=1 count=14 skip=$((0x400)) | hexdump
You should get
 - one byte for the keyboard status, 0x20 == Numlock
 - seven words for the legacy serial and parallel ports, port address only
   (e.g. 03f8 02f8 0000 0000 0378 0000 0000)
