Subject: How to programatically determine if policy-based routing is compiled  into the kernel?

I have a product that is dependent on policy-based (source routing)
and would like to be able to scream loudly at install and startup if
policy-based routing is not enabled in the kernel.
Is there some way to determine this?  Specifically, I'd love
a way to find out through the /proc system, but an ioctl or
similar call would be OK.  I'd even settle for some other tool,
like 'ip', if I could just figure out what commands to tell it.
Thanks,
Ben
