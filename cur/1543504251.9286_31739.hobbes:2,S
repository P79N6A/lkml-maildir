Kernel version 2.3.12-7
both make config and make dep give me problems complaining about the lack
of the drivers/parport directory, which seems indeed strange.  Upon
removing it from the makefile, since I don't use my parallell port to
begin with, make dep works fine.  However the next problem pops up with a
make bzImage
everything is compiling along fine when along comes this message:
/usr/src/linux/asm/mmu_context.h: In function 'activate_context':
In file included from sched.c:38:
/usr/src/linux/asm/mmu_context.h:34 Structure has no member named 'cr3'
sched.c: in function 'schedule':
sched.c:801: warning: Implicit declaration of function 'switch_mm'
this then kills the compile process.
The kernel was origonally downloaded as linux-2.3.11.tar.bz2 and patched
with pre-patch-2.3.12-7.gz
system is pentium 100
Thanks
Erik
