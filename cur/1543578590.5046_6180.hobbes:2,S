The old code did it with #ifdef __SMP__ tests so it only screwed up SMP boxes,
which at the time was quite acceptable because real people didnt have them
and certainly at the price didnt put ne2000's in them 8)
The basic problem is that you cannot allow
	-	set multicast list
	-	open/close
	-	irq
	-	transmit
to occur except when serialized because of the indirection and register
gunge on the chip. The copies are slow and long enough that they prevent
28.8 modem sessions being usable.
I'd have to check the chip manual to be sure you even disable the irqs
without corrupting an in progress transfer
