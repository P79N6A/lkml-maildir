This patch went in to 2.6.4-rc1, didn't it? It seems to have exacerbated
a problem which used to be occasional, but now seems to happen after
every print job.
I see the following, and the error repeats until I power cycle the
printer (HPLJ 1200 on AMD768 OHCI):
usb 1-1.3.2: control timeout on ep0in
drivers/usb/class/usblp.c: usblp0: error -110 reading printer status
