At random time, when user asks to change fbdev->output mapping... And it 
still means that I have to create new EDID based on all EDIDs I read from 
each output - this is biggest problem, and that currently used videomode
can become invalid - and this is even worse problem.
In the past life was sweet, user apps showed windows that currently used
setting is unavailable, and offered some changes. Now when we are moving
more and more policy to the kernel...
