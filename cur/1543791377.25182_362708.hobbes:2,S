Many boards DO allow remapping memory past 3GB to the 4GB+ area to make
it accessable.  There should be a BIOS option for remapping memory or
letting software create a memory hole at 3GB.  It is NOT normal to not
allow full access to all the memeory on an amd64/em64t system.  Of
course the bios defaults are often set so as to provide as much ram to a
32bit OS as possible at the expense of doing it properly for a 64bit OS.
And it looks like the world has no intension of ever moving to IA64, and
that's probably for the best.  PowerPC or Alpha or something would make
more sense if you are going to drop x86.
