But with the current Linux implementation it is possible that a call to select()
returns while a call to recvmsg() would have blocked, and that is not
correct according to POSIX.
And I indeed read this as meaning that the first recvmsg() after the select()
may not block.

I don't think this is ``trying to adhere to the standards''... not by a long shot.
