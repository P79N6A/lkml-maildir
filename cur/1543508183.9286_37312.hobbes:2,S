I talked with Steven a while back about this, but it is perfectly
permissable to give the sysctl call a larger buffer than is needed
for the data and let it fill in the space which is available with
the requested values.
sysctl({VM_NET,NET_ROUTE,NET_ROUTE_METRIC,0},buf,sizeof(buf)
                                          ^ no route given, so
all routes are returned (if possible).
The problem is that this results in quite a nice race condition
when some route gets added between sysctl's
