Hello,
I've got a sendmail 8.1.11 process hanging in D state with 2.2.18.
ps -eo fname,tty,pid,stat,pcpu,nwchan,wchan  reveals the following:
  PID STAT %CPU  WCHAN WIDE-WCHAN-COLUMN COMMAND 
16176 D     0.0 1f4c28 down_failed       sendmail: startup with ...
Is this likely a bug in the kernel or in sendmail? Also let me
know what additional info I could provide to help track down the
bug.
Regards,
Udo.
