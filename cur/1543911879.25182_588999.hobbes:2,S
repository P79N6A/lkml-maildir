I know.  Did I say something to the contrary?
Maybe I was too terse; in more detail: the original poster appears to be
mounting server:/exports/data by first mounting server:/ somewhere and
then bind-mounting the exports/data someplace else.  I couldn't see an
obvious reason they'd be using two steps instead of just performing a
single mount of server:/exports/data.
So my assumption was that this was due to a confused memory of some
server-side setup instructions.  (On the server side, nfs4 export setup
often requires the administrator to do some extra bind mounts which
shouldn't really be necessary.)
