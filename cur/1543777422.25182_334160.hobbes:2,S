Umm.  Except, according to your description of what it's supposed to
do, the above code can have an accumulating error.
	unsigned long timeout, max_timeout, now;
	now = jiffies;
	timeout = now + HZ/100;
	max_timeout = now + HZ/2;
	for (;;) {
		if (ready())
			return 0;
		if (time_after(timeout, jiffies))
			break;
		sleep_until(timeout);
		timeout += HZ/100;
	}
would be even more correct, if we had an absolute schedule_timeout()
called sleep_until().  If we woke up late, we will schedule the next
wakeup exactly 10ms after the previous wakeup _should_ have happened.
Quick!  Convert all the kernel interfaces back to absolute time! 8)
