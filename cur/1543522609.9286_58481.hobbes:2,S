Agree, jumpers will never died ;)

Ok, but for Tom case, config_chipset_for_pio(..) is never called and
idebus=xxx is simply ignored.

Well, WDC disks are safely detected and driver fall back to dma2, for some
strange reasons that I can't remember my first hack failed to detect a WDC
and bonnie eat the filesystem, after that I've also put an extra hdparm -d0 /dev/hdc
to my rc.local ;)
