Well, having looked at it once again I think I was wrong that this change would
break freeze_filesystems(), because it only calls freeze_bdev() after checking
if sb->s_frozen is not set to SB_FREEZE_TRANS (freeze_filesystems() is only
called after all of the userspace processes have been frozen).
However, XFS_IOC_FREEZE happily returns 0 after calling freeze_bdev(),
apparetnly assuming that it won't fail.
Greetings,
Rafael
