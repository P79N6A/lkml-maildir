hello,
minor bugfix for vsprintf.c, vsscanf did not discard whitespace in input:
- when encoutering whitespace in fmt not followed by '%'
- in conversion where result is ignored with '*'
There is another bugfix in this, don't know from who. (picked it up with uml)
(vsscanf used to skip two characters in the fmt for a single char in the input if not in
conversion.)
Patch against 2.4.12, I am afraid.
enjoy,
	J.
