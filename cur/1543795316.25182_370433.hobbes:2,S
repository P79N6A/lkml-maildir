While I agree with Alan and Jeff's response about using a newer
kernel, I do have some suggestions.  I personally had similar
experience when installing on newer Dell servers and found the issue
to be the LSI drivers.  While installation found the hard drive and
completed installation, I found that I needed to load the latest LSI
drivers during the install to get the system to boot correctly.  I
checked the Dell site and they do provide drivers for Red Hat 7.3, so
I would try loading the appropriate drivers for your system.
