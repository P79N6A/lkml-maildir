Then they should carefully think about whether they need GFP_ATOMIC or
GFP_KERNEL.  Just like we don't have a kalloc() that uses GFP_ATOMIC
to spare people from having to think about it.
ISDN and sound had done that thinking for me -- one knew they needed
GFP_ATOMIC, the other needed GFP_KERNEL.  I was able to work out that
GFP_KERNEL made sense for the partition code.
