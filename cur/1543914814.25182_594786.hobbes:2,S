How does that help? Will slabs move objects around to combine two
partially filled slabs into nearly full one? If not consider this:
- You create a slab for 4k objects based on 64k compound pages.
  (first of all that wastes you a page already for the meta infos)
- Something movable allocates a 14 4k page in there making the slab
  partially filled.
- Something unmovable alloactes a 4k page making the slab mixed and
  full.
- Repeat until out of memory.
OR
- Userspace allocates a lot of memory in those slabs.
- Userspace frees one in every 15 4k chunks.
- Userspace forks 1000 times causing an unmovable task structure to
  appear in 1000 slabs.
