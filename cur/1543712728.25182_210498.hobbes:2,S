I know it's an opcode (I even wrote an emulator for it). But it's used
as an inline function in linux. Check include/asm-i386/system.h.

Yes, only if you compile with -m486 or higher. When Linux is compiled for
386 target, the -march=i386 is correctly appended, which prevents gcc from
using this instruction (as well as bswap and xadd BTW).
In what I described, a 386 target would be compiled with -march=i386,
but the cmpxchg() FUNCTION will still reference the cmpxchg op-code
in the __asm__ statement, and this is perfectly valid. In this case,
only callers of the cmpxchg() FUNCTION will have a chance to use it.
And at the moment, the only client seems to be ACPI.
Anyway, I think that basically we understand ourselves, and it's just
a matter of words.
Cheers,
Willy
