This may seem counterintuitive, but postponing swapping / cache flushing
to disk till the last possible moment is counterproductive. It's a
little like procrastination in the time management world -- when the
time finally comes when you *have* to flush stuff out to disk, your poor
daemons / kernel threads go catatonic trying to keep up, and you end up
both CPU-bound and I/O bound. It is far better to have enough free
memory available to satisfy the demand for pages, even if that means
*raising* the watermarks, *more* swapping and smaller page caches.
