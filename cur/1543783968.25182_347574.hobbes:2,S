I'll add this patch to my sparc tree, thanks Al.
Admittedly, the whole RTC situation is quite a mess I have to
agree.
To make the problem worse, we have two sets of RTC ioctls
which userland makes use of on Sparc.  The older ones which
the SBUS RTC driver exported and supported, and the normal
ones the rest of the world uses.  Because the normal RTC driver
gets used as well, userland actually tries both ioctl sets.
Therefore, it probably would work to completely do away with
the SBUS RTC ioctl support, and only use the normal ones.
This would make using the generic RTC driver much easier, I
would think.
Anyways, I've added this to my sparc64 TODO list at:
	 
http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/sparc64_todo.html
so that I can get to dealing with this at some point.
