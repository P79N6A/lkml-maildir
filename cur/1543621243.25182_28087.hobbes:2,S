At the prompting of Ingo Oeser, here's a patch.  A BK patch has already
been sent to Linus.
CSET comment:
  Fix generic memcmp() to correctly sign the return value.
  Non x86 architectures using memcmp() in situations where the sign
  of the return value matters would get the wrong answer (in 
  signed 8-bit arithmetic, 0 - 221 = 35, rather than the -221
  that many might assume/expect).
