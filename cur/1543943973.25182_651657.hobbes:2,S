Speaking of which.. the kernel implementation of snprintf() seems
to have a bug somewhere, in that it returns an incorrect count in
some situations -- mostly around where the buffer is too small to
hold the data being written.  There's an off-by-one bug there somewhere,
but I have not had time yet to track it down more precisely.
