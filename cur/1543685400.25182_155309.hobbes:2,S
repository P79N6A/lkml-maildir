The 2.4 tmpfs did not support sendfile (or loop) until 2.4.22-pre3,
so Red Hat's 2.4.20-13.9smp won't do it.
If you're at ease with patching the kernel source and rebuilding your
kernel, please let me know: I should be able to send you the necessary
patch (mainly mm/shmem.c) to add those features into your Red Hat 9 tmpfs.
