Subject: "make clean": how it's needed?

I have this doubt, the "standard" procedure to build a kernel(2.2.x/2.4.x) is:
	make menuconfig
	make dep
	make clean	// ... when?
	make modules
	make bzImage
	...
so, when I really _MUST_ run "make clean"?
	always?
	only after that I have applied a patch?
I think that many old "*.o" files are still good... and so, why I should 
recompile them every time?
Bye,
	Paolo
