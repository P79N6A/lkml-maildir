Note that on ia64 we don't use bit-masking to calculate the
task-pointer.  Instead, thread-info follows the task structure.  This
is done such that the task-structure, thread-info, and kernel stack
can be mapped by a single (pinned) TLB entry.
The correct check for a variable being on the stack of the current
task would be something like this:
	((unsigned long)(ptr) - (unsigned long) current) < IA64_STK_OFFSET
(IA64_STK_OFFSET is declared by <asm/ptrace.h>).
Thanks,
