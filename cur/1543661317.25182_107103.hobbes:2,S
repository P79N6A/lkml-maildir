Yes, the description is a bit confusing. There is a scsi driver
for s/390 but it is not in the tree. But the fsf.h include file
is and this is part of the zfcp scsi driver. This include file
doesn't make sense on its own and the driver is still changing.
So it's best to remove the file. You could argue if this is an
update...
