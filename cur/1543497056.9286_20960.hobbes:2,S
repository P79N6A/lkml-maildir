Thank you.  I will remember this next time I do an install.
I know that I have more than 1023 cyl too... (9gb scsi)  Although I have
the drive partitioned into 5 slices for the major dirs... I wonder if lilo
is trying to pull vmlinux from the end of the drive and that is what
causes the error.
  On second thought no... my /boot dir is off of the root partition
/dev/sda5.  All 300M of it is inside the 1023 cyl mark.  Has to be..
/dev/sda1 is only a 500M dos partition. (dosemu and novell client)  I have
linux/arch/i386/boot/Makefile modified to rename the prev system.map and
kernels to backups and copy the new ones in, make symlinks and run lilo.
I have used this technique on all of the kernels I have ever installed and
have had no problems.
  The only thing I can get from this, as Alan said, is that the new
version (21) of lilo has a lower threshold on the kernel size be it
z-compressed or bz'd.  This leads to the final question... why?
And why is the 2.2.5-15 kernel supplied with RH6 weighing in at a hefty
617K work with lilo and 2.3.2 at 471K doesn't?!?!?!
Back where I started... slightly confused.
