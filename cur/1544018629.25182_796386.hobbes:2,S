You don't give much information but if it seems to be non working then I
would look hard at the IRQ/IO reported

Boggle - what flow control wiring have you done ?

It is maintained and should be pretty solid. Seria console is one of the
less used bits but when it gets broken people do jump up and down and
shout about it.
The big outstanding bug I know about is the incompatibility between the
PnP 8250 drivers and serial console - that may be your machine C case.
That one is rather hard to fix so on the long rather than short term hit
list.
