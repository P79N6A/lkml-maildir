Guys, there really needs to be a
few more replies to make a decision.
So far only Dmitry have clearly stated
his opinion regarding both patches.
And that opinion was: no need for the
new config option, just get the 2.6.25
patch reverted.
Dmitry, after reading the older Michael's
thread, would you perhaps reconsider?
Sam and Michael said that just revering
may not be a good idea, but have not
commented on the patch that adds a new
option under "if EMBEDDED".
That puts me in a position where both
patches are effectively blocked, and
in a mean time snd-pcsp remains broken.
Guys, please, give your ACK or NACK on
the two posted patches! :)
