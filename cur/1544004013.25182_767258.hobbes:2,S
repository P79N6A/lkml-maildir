I believe you need to remove the obvious null events at the low end (no
interrupt happened) and renormalize to the same scale for the histograms
to make sense.
As it is, the difference in the number of events that actually matters
dominate the graphs; for example, there are 142187 events >= 12 in
hack10ticks, but 136533 in hack10ticks_hpa.
