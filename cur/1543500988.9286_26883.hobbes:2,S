Only in the sense that if there were just one serial number, 
different browsers would not be in sync (which probably isn't 
important unless they had to communicate, for which I can't 
think of a good reason). And if there are many fd's on
many hosts, how do they get their Modified and Serial
numbers synced to the remote NFS files?
