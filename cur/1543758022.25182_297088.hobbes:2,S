Hi,
Following set of patches go one step ahead in restoring the broken kdump
functionality in -mm tree on x86. Most of the kdump functionality has
now moved to kexec user space (kexec-tools).
This patch set performs following.
kexec-tool-1.101
(

)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Create a backup region and copy the first 640K of memory to backup
  region over a crash.
- Generate Elf headers representing crashed memory and store in reserved
  region. Also appends the memmap= and elfcorehdr= parameters to command
  line internally to be passed to capture kernel.
2.6.11-rc4-mm1
--------------
- Export address of start of crash notes section (crash_notes) to user
  space through sysfs
I look forward for comments and suggestions. I have done basic testing
on uni and 4way (SMT) systems. 
2.6.11-rc4-mm1 does not boot if booted with kexec enabled and
crashkernel=X@Y is passed as command line parameter. Following patch
needs to be applied to rectify the problem.
