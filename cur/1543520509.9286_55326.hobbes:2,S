Hmmm. But kernel contains features marked 'experimental'. Like experimental
things, secure Linux patch can go into kernel with some remark like experimantal.
(in this case: "big warning, ..."). Pre-XFree 4.0 servers seem to segfault
with this patch. Anyone who has got similar sympthoms ?
BTW, restricted proc fs should go into kernel tree (do not care in this case
if unexecutable stack goes in or not), because it's the minimum to have
an ability to hide my processes from others. It's VERY simple and trivial
patch, only alters file access permissions in /proc.
