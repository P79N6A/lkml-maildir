: I'd like to announce the source code release for Scheduled Transfer
: Protocol (STP) support in Linux.  SGI played a major role in the
: development of STP to address 2 sides of the performance coin at the
: same time: high bandwidth and low latency.  Current GSN hardware with
: STP achieves 720MB/sec on a single stream in bandwidth and 6 usec in
: latency validating these combined design goals.
Folks, I was at SGI when they did this stuff and I've used it personally
quite a bit.  It's very cool.  I think this is definitely worth a look 
and I'll be playing around with it.
One thing that I've dreamed about for a while is getting the disk drive
vendors to put STP down in the drives.  Then we throw out the SCSI/IDE
cables and use RJ45 connectors to talk to both the network and the disks.
Think hot plug.  Cool, no?
