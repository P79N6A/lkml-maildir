This is not a real solution - more of a starting point. If you have
enough free space on *ANOTHER* partition, try to make a backup of the
partition that contains the filesystem *before* unmounting it.
If /foo is the mount point of the ext3fs with the deleted files
If /foo sits on /dev/hda5
If /bar has enough free space to hold a partition image of /dev/hda5
issue the following command:
dd if=/dev/hda5 of=/bar/image
and try to recover the data from the image. If the files are really
important, you can try to e2fsck the *image file* and attack it with
undeletion utilities (probably won't work) or mark all free blocks used
by hand, e2fsck the image file again and pick up the mess from /lost+found.
HTH,
