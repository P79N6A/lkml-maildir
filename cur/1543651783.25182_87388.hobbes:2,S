I do in fact remember you. :)  If I scrounge around on my computer at work, I 
could probably still find all the information you sent me about the problems 
you were having.

To say we are going to rip out the guts of the user-land tools is probably a 
bit extreme. The user tools already do their own version of volume discovery, 
separate from the kernel. So since that logic already exists, we simply need 
to add some processing after that discovery to communicate with the kernel 
drivers to activate the volumes. And yes, this dramatically reducing the 
amount of kernel code needed. In our current kernel driver, I'd say easily 50 
to 75% of the code was just for the in-kernel volume discovery.

Yes, in order for something like volume management to be easy and seemless to
user, it should be presented to them at the time they install their system. 
Having to go back and setup up volumes after the OS is installed is 
definitely cumbersome. We are hoping this change will make it easier for EVMS 
to work on a wider variety of distributions. But we are already on our way. 
We've done a lot of work with UL, Debian, and Gentoo, and this will hopefully 
make things easier for those folks in the long run.

Thanks. I'll keep that in mind. :)
