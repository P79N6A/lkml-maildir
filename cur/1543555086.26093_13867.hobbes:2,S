Subject: 7-order allocation failed

I'm getting '__alloc_pages: 7-order allocation failed.' every time I
play something to my maestro card (using the maestro kernel module,
with dsps_order=2)..
I'm assuming the following code is to blame:
/* alloc as big a chunk as we can */
for (order = (dsps_order + (16-PAGE_SHIFT) + 1); order >= (dsps_order + 2 + 1); order--)
        if((rawbuf = (void *)__get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL|GFP_DMA, order)))
                break;
Of course, it doesn't seem to cause any problems, but the warning is
really starting to get on my nerves...
