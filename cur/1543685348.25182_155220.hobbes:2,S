> Why do people ever want a "converter"?
That's been discussed before.
Because people don't have the resources (hard disk space, tape drives, 
money)  to backup their data, and might still be interested in testing a 
new filesystem. They might be willing to take a risk with the new fs 
and converter. Amazing as it may sound, people do that. I am such a 
tester, and I'd find a converter to be a useful tool. But since the 
previous discussion on the subject concluded it'd be really hard to 
impossible to write one, I guess I'll have to settle for new hard drive(s).
