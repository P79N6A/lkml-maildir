Because you can not go yanking devices out from under the kernel without 
it's knowledge or consent.  This is no more acceptable than ejecting a 
floppy without first unmounting it; the only difference is that the 
floppy drive doesn't erroneously inform the kernel that you have done 
this simply because you suspend.

Then they shot themselves in the foot.  That is no different than 
switching mounted floppies while suspended, or removing a mounted IDE 
hard drive while suspended, so they get what they deserve.

No, they don't.  Users do not expect ( or should not and are told not to 
by admins ) to be able to yank out their usb memory stick while it is 
mounted.  They are told to always unmount first.  If they fail to do so, 
then they get what they asked for.  It doesn't matter if the disk is 
SCSI or USB; you don't go yanking it out without unmounting it first, or 
you will loose data.

Users are already told to eject/unmount the media before removing it.  
If they fail to do that, it doesn't matter if the system is suspended or 
not; they broke the drive when they yanked it out while mounted.  As for 
fixing the kernel to unmount it for you, that is not always possible; 
take the root on usb case. 
Maybe it does make sense to have hibernation scripts unmount removable 
media for the common silly user who can't remember to unmount disks 
before ejecting/unplugging them, but you should be able to suspend a 
system with its root on a usb disk and not have the kernel panic for no 
good reason when it resumes.
