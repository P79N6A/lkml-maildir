That's a fairly stupid argument, since it assumes operator intervention, 
at which point you have access to the machine anyway.
A stronger argument is, again, that some bootloaders can do unattended 
fallback.
However, this test should probably be pushed earlier, into setup.S, 
where executing a BIOS-clean reboot is much easier.
