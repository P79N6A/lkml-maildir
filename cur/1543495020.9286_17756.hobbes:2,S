Greetings,
	I believe I have two bugs submitted for your approval.  I'm afraid I
haven't a clue as to what is actually going on.  Here are the two separate
problems.  We have a RedHat 6.0 system running 2.2.5 compiled on egcs which
decides occasionally to ipx flood our entire network.  We are using IPX for
nothing, just in case you're wondering.  The system is using an eepro100.o
module for the ethernet driver.  The process we're assuming that did it was
rpciod, which was about the only network daemon still running while it was
happening.  We couldn't kill -9 it, so I'm guessing it made a kernel call
that just freaked out.
	Totally separate problem, part II... I'm also running a RedHat 4.2 system
with kernel 2.2.0-pre5 which kernel Oopses.  I'm not sure if this has been
fixed
since this kernel, but here's the Oops anyway:
ly disabling functions (7f7e).
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address

Aiee, killing interrupt handler
Kernel panic: Attempted to kill the idle task!
In swapper task - not syncing
This happens everytime the aforementioned machine begins to flood the
network.  If I reboot it, it Ooopses as soon as it's booting (I'm assuming
as it's initializing the network -- never looked).
If there's anything I can do to help track this down, please let me know
and I will do what I can.  Thank you.
