Hi All,
I found a smp race condition on startup
of the 2.4.18 kernel when I put a printk
in schedule.
See the comment below in 
/init/main.c
/*
 * We need to finalize in a non-__init function or
else race conditions
 * between the root thread and the init thread may
cause start_kernel to
 * be reaped by free_initmem before the root thread
has proceeded to
 * cpu_idle.
 */
static void rest_init(void)
Note that init_idle the first thing  called from
cpu_idle.
& it is freed from 
free_initmem in the init function in main.c
which may be called before the cpu
gets into cpu_idle.
Here is the patch.
