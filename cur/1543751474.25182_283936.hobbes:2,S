Hi thanks a lot for a reply.
Actually I want to use hot plug feature of PCI Express for FC-HBA. I have
investigated for 2.4 kernels, but they do not support hot plug here.
I don't have any idea about 2.6 series.
I believe that in Kernel 2.6 the driver in the below mentioned is the same
as the driver I am referring to.
/usr/src/linux/drivers/pci/hotplug/pciehp
So I want to know the functionality of hot plug support on PCI Express in
Kernel 2.6.8. How the information flow and what are the limitations.
Please help me out and thanks in advance for your concern.

What is not working for you?
Also, please read REPORTING-BUGS in the kernel source tree for how to
report an issue properly.
thanks,
