Umm... see 
http://www.minion.de/nvidia
 - or have you tried that and it
still doesn't work, or you trying to get the XFree driver working, or is
it some other issue?
(One gotcha that hosed *ME* up was the fact that recent XFree86 are TLS-sensitive,
and NVidia's latest few series of drivers included TLS libs for OpenGL - but
I didn't have /lib/tls and/or /usr/lib/tls in /etc/ld.so.conf so ldconfig
didn't DTRT - THAT horqued things up but good).
