I've undertaken quite a task; I'm rewriting all the config-menus at the
moment (for all platforms) to make them more uniform (same indentation
everywhere, etc.)
A few things that I've added, that I want comments on:
o  A "Code maturity"-menu for PPC, as it was the only port without this
   menu
o  A "Prompt for drivers/code flagged DANGEROUS" option in the
   code-maturity section that is conditional depending on EXPERIMENTAL
o  (EXPERIMENTAL) has been added to all drivers inside CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL
   if's, and CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL if's has been added where missing
o  All drivers/code saying DANGEROUS has been changed from
   CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL to CONFIG_DANGEROUS
o  Some smaller fixes has been made (for instance, there was two
   occurences of "Frame-buffer support" in the MIPS-port
o  I've indented all the config-files in a uniform way
I've of course also included the other patches I did earlier in the same
direction.
Now, my main question is:
"Is this something I'm going to hate myself forever for doing -- something
that noone will accept, or is it something that could actually be accepted
into the kernel mainstream?"
My patches are against v2.3.17, if anyone wonders.
