Powerdown is going to have the same problems as the powerdown at the
end of suspend-to-disk. Can you ask people reporting broken shutdown
to try suspend-to-disk?

So something is wrong with ACPI wakeup GPEs. It would hurt in
suspend-to-disk case, too.

I do not think any "semantic" issues exist. We need to pass detailed
info down to the drivers that care, and we need to fix all the bugs in
the drivers. That should be pretty much it.
