Agree, existing AIO interface is far from ideal IMO, but it is used. No
matter if it is normal or not, AIO itself is not normal interface -
there are no books about POSIX AIO, so no one knows about AIO at all.

Userspace_API_is_the_ever_possible_last_thing_to_ever_think_about. Period
. // <- wrapped one
If system is designed that with API changes it breaks - that system sucks 
wildly and should be thrown away. Syslets do not suffer from that.
We can have tons of interfaces any alien would be happy with (imho it is
not even kernel's task at all) - new table of syscalls the way usual ones 
are used for example. 
And we will have async_stat() exactly the same way people would use that.
It is not even a thing to discus. There are other technical issues with
syslets yet to resolve. If people do happy with design of the system, it
is time to think about how it will look from user's point of view.
syslet(__NR_stat) -> async_stat() - say it and Ingo and other developers
will think about how to implement that or start to discuss that it is
bad interface, and instead something else should be invented.
If interface sucks and _interface_ must be changed/extended/replaced.
If overall design sucks and it must be changed.
Solve problems one-by-one, not throwing something just because it uses
wild interface which can be changed in a minute.

There is absolutely _NO_ problem in having any interface people will use.
What one will you?
async_stat() instead of syslet(complex_struct_blah_sync)?
No problem - it is _really_ trivial to implement.
Ingo mentioned that it should be done, and it is really simple task for
glibc just like it is done for usual syscalls, which has completely nothing 
with overall system design at all.

Then no problem. 
Interface does suck, especially since it does not allow to forbid some
syscalls from async execution, but it is just a brick which allows to
build really good system of it.
I personally vote for table of async syscalls transferred into 
human-readable aliases like async_stat() and the like.
