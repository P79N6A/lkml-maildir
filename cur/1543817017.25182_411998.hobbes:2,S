I don't know if the local counter version values can be unsigned in this
case.  Consider a case like this with the initial counter value to be 0,
and FBC_BATCH is 32 (8cpusx4)
cpu 1				cpu 2			cpu 3
--------			-------			--------
add(10)
//local = 10 fbc = 0.
				sub(5)
				//local = -5 fbc = 0
							add(31)
							//local = 31 fbc = 0
				sub(30)
				//local = 0 fbc = -35
				--------------->(A)
Now if the local counters were unsigned, and the global counters unsigned
too, counter read at A would result in a large value, which would mislead
the app.  Maybe it doesn't matter if we use percpu_counter_exceeds at
critical places, so these get caught, but that would mean going on all cpus
more often than before..and that would also mean weird values when we just
use percpu_counter_read to print these counters.
So maybe using long long is a simpler solution here? Andrew, thoughts?

I guess most of the uses for per-cpu counters will be up counters, we don't
need the signedness if it wasn't for the issues above.  The nr_files,
memory_allocated counters are up counters too.
Thanks,
