In the program below -Wall doesn't warn in neither 2.95 nor 3.2. You
need -Wsign-compare to get a warning. IMHO a warning is useful in this
example, some people might wrongly assume that the "Hello, world!" would
be printed more than once.
<--  snip  -->
#include <stdio.h>
int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
#define COUNT (sizeof(array)/sizeof(array[0]))
int main()
{
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < COUNT; i++)
    {
      i -= 2;
      printf("Hello, world!\n");
    }
  return(0);
}
