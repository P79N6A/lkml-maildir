The Micrel board doesn't support hotplugged PCI devices.
I guess other KS8695-based boards can have a PCI-to-Cardbus controller,
and that would need hotpluged PCI support.
But technically that function should probably not be marked as __init.
And "struct ks8695_pci_cfg" should be __initdata.
The PCI support for the KS8695 is not currently merged in mainline.  So
I will fix this (if nobody has yet) once the PCI support goes in.
Regards,
