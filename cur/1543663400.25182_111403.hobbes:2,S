Subject: [patch] task_prio() fix

Looks like task_prio() should do:
        int task_prio(task_t *p)
        {
        	return p->prio - MAX_RT_PRIO;
        }
Instead of subtracting MAX_USER_RT_PRIO, since the maximum _user_ value
has nothing to do with the maximum that may be stored.  The effect is if
MAX_RT_PRIO != MAX_USER_RT_PRIO, then all priorities are skewed by
(MAX_RT_PRIO - MAX_USER_RT_PRIO).
Ingo, this looks trivial to me... but I swear it _used_ to work and this
function has always been like this.  Comments?
Patch is against 2.5.62.
