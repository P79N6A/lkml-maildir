Do we really need to do a distributed reference counter implementation
inside dst cache code ? If you are willing to wait for a while,
we should have modified Rusty's bigref implementation on top of the 
interleaving dynamic per-cpu allocator. We can look at distributed 
reference counter for dst refcount then and see how that can be 
worked out.
Thanks
