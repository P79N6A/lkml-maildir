There aren't any in there right now.  The patches that Martin is
referring to were probably a couple from Anton that got fixed and merged
long, long ago.  There's one that we keep around for ppc64, but it's not
applicable to any other architectures and it's not really mainline
material anyway.  
I think Martin needs to update his list.
