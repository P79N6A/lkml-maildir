I don't see how this is true. If a process writes "2" to a PCI device's
state file, what else are sane things to do?
You dropped the fundamental point, and I don't understand why you disagree
with it - the driver core should not be dictating policy to the downstream
drivers. It is currently doing this by filtering the power state that is
passed in via the "state" file.

And I was sort of wrong. I think an ideal interface would allow the bus
drivers to export the states that they support, and would allow a state
name of any format to be written to that file.
One way to do that is to have each bus driver export its equivalent of a
"state" file for each device. But, a better solution is to leverage the
infrastructure that is already in place and export things through the
existing "state" file.
These patches are steps along that path. They prevent the core from
filtering the state value passed in. It's still an integer value, but it
allows any possible state to be used.
We could just as easily leave it as a string, and have the buses parse the
value to their expectations. Eventually we might want to do something like
that, or have them export a list of string states that they support.
Regardless, that is all in the future, and is completely orthogonal to
letting a device support more than just "on" or "off".
Thanks,
