Subject: [ANNOUNCE] High resolution POSIX timers available

The High Resolution Timers project:
 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/high-res-timers/
has just released a new and improved version for the 2.4.13 kernel.  
This version completes the core kernel work and the i386 platform work. 
The project provides timers with micro second resolution while not
increasing system overhead until a timer that lies between two jiffies
is about to expire. 
Save for thread signal restrictions in linux, the timers provided by the
project are fully compliant with POSIX standards 1003.1b-1993 as
extended by 1003.1j-2000.
