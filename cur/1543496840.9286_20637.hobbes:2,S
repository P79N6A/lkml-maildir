If I'm reading your description correctly, then my proposed patch
deals with that as well, so let me summarise:
 1. The current situation is that the routine to read the time
    from the RTC has no idea what timezone offset the RTC is
    returning, and just returns the value it finds.
 2. My patch, if used correctly, means that the routine to read
    the time from the RTC will ALWAYS return UTC time, which is
    what the kernel stores internally anyway.
 3. As a result of applying the said patch, the apm routine only
    needs to read the RTC as part of the "resume" step, and use
    the time returned by doing so.
 4. The said patch also deals with the boot-time race between
    hwclock and fsck as recently reported in linux-kernel, and
    which was the inspiration for the patch in the first place.
I will point out that my patch as supplied does NOT handle the WRITING
of the RTC, and the requirements for doing so need to be fully sorted
out before that can be written. Here's some possibilities:
 1. The program calling the write RTC routine may assume that it
    is to write either a UTC time or a local time to the RTC. As
    far as hwclock is concerned, this decision is made by the
    user when calling it, based on whether they supply the --utc
    option or not.
 2. If the program is writing a local time, it may specify one
    where DST should be set, or one where it should not.
As I see it, any changes to the write RTC routine will need to be
coordinated with the author of hwclock and other similar programs.
From my viewpoint, the ONLY implementation that would be safe would be
to make the existing write-RTC syscall return an error saying "Sorry,
this syscall is obsolete, and you will need to obtain an updated
program that uses the new syscall", then provide a new syscall that
assumes that the time passed to it is in UTC and unadjusts it in
precicely the opposite way to what the read-RTC syscall does.
However, I would suspect that such a measure would be unacceptable.
Best wishes from Riley.
