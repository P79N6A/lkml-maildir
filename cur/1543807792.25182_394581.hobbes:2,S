Oh, heavens. Could you people (and here I include pretty much everyone 
who manufactures laptops) please (please!) just implement the ACPI video 
extension? We're going to end up having to ship a 200K library for 
each and every laptop manufacturer who's decided to implement basic 
functionality in a proprietary manner, and it's going to make me cry.
(Which SMI do I need for brightness control? The libsmbios docs seem to 
be remarkably quiet on what functionality is actually available, and I'm 
not keen on calling things randomly :))
