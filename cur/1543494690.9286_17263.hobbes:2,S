Just to give everyone a status report: We're now running 2.2.7ac1,
with the newest Sangoma code, and all seems well so far. 
(Router UP Time:  40 hour(s)).  As I'm sure you all know, no version
of Sangoma code that I've tried works nor even compiles with the stock
2.2.x kernels, with or without the supplied Sangoma patch.  (Haven't
tried 2.2.1 as there were other problems with that kernel.)  The
current situation is a bit confusing.  This is in no way to deny the
outstanding work everyone has done here; 2.0.34 is an incredibly
stable solution.
Under 2.2.6 with only Alan's wanpipe patches included, we ran a job
each minute to ping the line, and invoke a dial backup if there were
problems.  At such points, from what I can gather,
/proc/net/wanrouter/status reads "connected", but ping fails.  I've
included a sample output from that job below.
Hopefully, this was due, at least in part, to some silly mistake I
made in extracting the wanpipe specific sections from Alan's patch;
maybe 2.2.7ac1 will solve all problems.  I only include this
information here as Alan has said others have had similar issues,
and this may help in debugging.
Take care,
