Subject: [PATCH 2.5] cpufreq: update system-wide loops_per_jiffy only on UP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/12/21/53

loops_per_jiffy should only be updated on UP systems - on SMP the CPUs might
have different such values when frequency scaling is active. On SMP it's
safest to use the default value calculated during the boot process.
