If you look at the bksend output from my site, it is broken up into
lots of smaller changes.  These changes are not tied to a particular
2.4.X revision - they were made and released in response to driver
bug reports and coded so the driver will operate in just about any
2.4.X kernel - customers can't wait for the next kernel to be
released or the community to enter a "pre" phase of development.
As for submitting "small fixes in separate patches", the fixes are
whatever size they come out to be after they are implemented.  I
always choose the fix based on correctness and maintainability, not
on whether or not I can break it up into small patches for submission.
In other-words, the size of the changes have nothing to do with their
merit.
What it seems you are asking for is more frequent submissions.
While that is possible, I don't know that it is in the best interest
of the community.  I submit a new update to kernel.org after changes
have had a time to settle and have been validated by Adaptec and
several of its customers.  Unless the failure is going to be seen
in wide-spread use and the fix is so obvious that it does not need
rigorous validation, I prefer to wait and submit a known quantity.
The latest drivers on my website have had a sufficient level of
testing for me to now feel comfortable with pushing the changes to
kernel.org.

I believe that SuSE is merging these drivers into their next 2.6.X
based release.
