Bogus argument: is a USB-Ethernet device which needs firmware loading  
boot-up critical? Not on the surface, but if the device loads root  
over this device, it suddenly is.
This functionality should also be written into the firmware-class  
(and this fact *is* acknowledged in the sparse documentation).
