It's a ramdisk resource management bug. To workaround it just do something
like:
	echo 5 > /proc/sys/vm/bdflush
The protected buffers are accounted as freeable by the VM. They are
instead unfreeable. So the VM algorithm fails. If you noticed you got the
sigbus while writing data to disk. 
The fix is to let mark_buffer_dirty() aware of the number of dirty buffers
in the system.
