Of course.  you're writing a = b = c, where a is x, b is (y)?x=1:x and c is 2.
It's illegal to assign (y)?x=1:x to something - that's an obvious invalid 
lvalue to me.  So x = 2 but what to do with the rest, who knows.
Try this one -
main() {
  int x=0, y=0, z = 0;
  x ? y : z = 1;
  printf("%d %d %d\n", x, y, z);
}
Compiles fine.  Output: 0 0 1.
Now set x=1 and find output: 1 1 0.
Isn't that sick :-)  gcc 2.7.2.3.
Based on that, a really good compiler could give your above statement as
x = (x=1) = 2
and then come out with x = 2.

Well, duh.  Brackets bind more tightly than equals last time I checked.
