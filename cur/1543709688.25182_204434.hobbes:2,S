It must be, or we'd not have had a driver working for several
years now!
The quick stop/restart cycles haven't seemed to be a problem
with any OHCI silicion in the way they are with, for example,
VIA EHCI.

My suspicions have been focussing on finish_unlinks().
That's really the only place the HCD does anything
that could corrupt the ED queues, which is what looks
to be happening.
Your change doesn't actually _unlink_ in the same way;
interesting change, I'll have to think about it.  It
certainly changes timings.

It's always safe to update those registers, except
that some silicon doesn't support that while the
controller is suspended.
