Hi Max,
  Here's the patch we discussed at the beginning of the month.
Linus,
  According to Documentation/SubmittingPatches "bug fixes" or "obvious" 
changes
  should CCed to you, so this is why I have done this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patch Description:
  Kernel Version: 2.6.20.4
  Summary:
    Fix tun/tap driver's handling of hw addresses.  Specifically, ensure 
that
    when the tun.dev_addr field is set, the net_device.dev_addr field gets
    set to the same value.
  Background:
    The device hw address is stored in 2 places, in the tun.dev_addr field,
    and of course the net_device struct's dev_addr field.  It really 
seems to
    me that the tun.dev_addr field is redundant, and that anywhere it is 
used
    it would be better to use the net_device.dev_addr field.  However, I do
    not want to start ripping things out of structs that other people might
    be using, so I've left it.
  Fixed Problem:
    The problem was that when one did an IOCTL on the tun/tap device, the
    device address would only get updated in the tun.dev_addr, and not the
    net_device.dev_addr field.  In addition, the initial setting of the
    tun.dev_addr and net_device.addr fields were different.  This meant that
    if you asked the tun/tap device for it's hw address, it would report a
    different value than ifconfig.
  Still Remaining Problem:
    There is a problem with not fixing the redundant tun.dev_addr field
    around.  The problem is that when the net_device.dev_addr gets updated,
    we get no notification of this update.  So if someone changes the 
address
    using "ifconfig hw ether xxxxx", then the net_device.dev_addr and
    tun.dev_addr fields different in value.  Not good.  If you think I 
should
    strip out the tun.dev_addr field and replace it's usage with
    net_device.dev_addr, then I will do that later.  However, I would 
need to
    do a survey to see if anyone else's code outside of tun.c depends on 
this
    field.  If so...I guess I'll just leave it.
