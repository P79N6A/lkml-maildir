Hm. I tend to think there was a reason for this, since this is actually
explicitly disabled by include/linux/types.h:
#ifdef __CHECKER__
#define __bitwise__ __attribute__((bitwise))
#else 
#define __bitwise__
#endif
#ifdef __CHECK_ENDIAN__
#define __bitwise __bitwise__
#else
#define __bitwise
#endif
The commit that introduced __CHECK_ENDIAN__ was
af4ca457eaf2d6682059c18463eb106e2ce58198 ("gfp_t: infrastructure") but
it doesn't say anything about the rationale for it.

I recently ran sparse on my config and was surprised by the number of
warnings. Then again, something in mmzone.h or so generated billions of
them...
In any case, I would love to have __CHECK_ENDIAN__ enabled by default at
least on the wireless code (just caught another bug with it...)
