Because I'm an amateur, and I had to start somewhere.

Something for the future would be to fork the background workload separately 
from the benchmarked workload. Having them all in the same mm does appear to 
cause other interactions which pollute the real time data as Ingo has pointed 
out to me privately.
I'm a little burnt out from the effort so far so it can wait.
Thanks for feedback.
