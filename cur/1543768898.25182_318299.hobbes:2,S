Dear diary, on Thu, May 12, 2005 at 10:57:35PM CEST, I got a letter
where Matt Mackall <mpm@selenic.com> told me that...

Yes it does. On the other side, it needs no server-side CGI. But I guess
it should be pretty easy to write some kind of server-side CGI streamer,
and it would then easily take just a single HTTP request (telling the
server the commit ID and receiving back all the objects).
