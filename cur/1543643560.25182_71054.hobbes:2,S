Great, I was going to do something nearly the same to help out
with debugging high-end embedded applications.  It is quite common
for us to see multiple PCI masters with PCI memory windows in sizes
ranging from 256MB-1GB that are being ioremapped and consuming
vmalloc space (along with all the other consumers).  I'd love to
see this in the kernel since it would make it much easier to debug
some folks' custom board ports when they show symptoms of running
out of vmalloc space (i.e. modules not loading).
