That's still "forever" if you don't specify a timeout in the select.

Select is defined as to return, with the appropriate bit set, if/when 
a nonblocking read/write on the file descriptor won't block. You'd 
get EBADF in this case, therefore causing the select to return would 
be a Good Thing.
A related problem is that the second thread my be inside a blocking 
read() instead of a select() call. It'd never continue.  :-(
HOWEVER: IMHO it's bad design to distribute the responsibility for 
file descriptors between threads.
Therefore I think that this behavior is a bug, but it's not one that 
needs to be fixed yesterday.
