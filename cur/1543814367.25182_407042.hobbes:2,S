I can only think that Brian went and set it.

Well, where were the pages allocated?  mmap()?  In that case the pages
might be considered driver-owned and yes, I guess the right place to free
them would be in the file's ->release() method.  (Sorry to sound vague, but
I haven't really worked on this stuff for a couple of years, and Hugh keeps
on megachanging it).
Lots of sound drivers do this sort of thing for their capture buffers - you
could check them to see what (or, knowing sound drivers, what not) to do.

One would need to work out what to do with these pages when they're shared,
after a fork - a ->nopage() handler would still be needed there, assuming
the VMA is marked VM_DONTCOPY.  Because we don't copy all the pte's on a
VM_DONTCOPY vma at fork()-time.  (I think we _could_, but we don't)
vm_insert_page() mucks around with rmap-named functions which don't
actually do rmap and sports apparently-incorrect comments wrt
PageReserved().  I don't know how well-cared-for it is...
