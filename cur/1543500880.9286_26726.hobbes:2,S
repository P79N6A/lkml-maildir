I've been thinking about this more. Shrinking the inode cache, while it
would be nice for "orthogonality" is not that important. The reason why it
got out of hand on my system is that I set my inode cache far too large for
my memory size. My fault, not the code.
I have not looked at the code, but from empirical evidence, the inode cache
can take a fair amount of memory per inode. I set my inode-max at 40690. 
Over time, the cache grew to nearly 10 megs. That was annoying since I only
have 64megs. But the real answer is (Doctor Doctor, it hurts when I do
this:  So, don't do  that). 
If I can figure out what the amount of memory used per inode, then I'll
submit some detailed doc updates to caution people about using too much. End
of required changes.
