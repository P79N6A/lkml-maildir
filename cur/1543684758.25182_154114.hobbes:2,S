Hi Andrew,
I think this bug is due to me using the aic7xxx_old code ver 5.x.x.
Under kernel 2.4.21 the aic7xxx (new) is ver 6.2.8 and it works great
with Adaptec AHA-2940U2W controller i have.
On 2.6.0-test2-mm3 (tried Linus test1,test2,mm1 and mm2) the NEW aic7xxx
uses ver 6.2.35 and will not scan my IBM drive even though it
initializes the correct SCSI ID,LUN etc...
I would like to contact and report this issue to the aic7xxx maintaner
and perhaps get it resolved.Where would be the best place to report this
kind of problem?
I have taken few screen captures which are available at:
http://www.blazebox.homeip.net:81/diffie/images/2.6.0-test2/
 and show
the aic7xxx (new) failure.
Regards,
Paul B.
