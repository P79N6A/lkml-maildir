IIRC, I am not sure that the pnp layer was able to pass the 64 bits 
memory adress for hpet correctly. But it would be nice if it works.
There are drivers/acpi/motherboard.c that done some stuff already handle 
by pnp/system.c.
There was an extention of a floppy driver in order to use acpi in -mm, 
but it seems to have been dropped.

yes.

PS : I saw in acpi ols paper that you plan once all dupe acpi drivers 
will be removed to register again the pnp device in acpi layer. Do you 
plan to add more check and for example add only device that have a CRS 
in pnp layer ?
PPS : is there any plan to integrate 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111827568001255&w=2 that 
seem to fix some init problem ?
