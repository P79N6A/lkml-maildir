	   It's fairly easy to implement, though. One line in
   fs/namei.c::may_delete(), one line in fs/nfsd/vfs.c::nfsd_link(), pair of
   #define's in fs.h and one more line in fs/ext2/inode.c::ext2_read_inode().
   If somebody wants it I will include it into the next portion of VFS
   cleanup that will be submitted to Linus - it obviously doesn't affect
   anything else. Final decision belongs to Linus, indeed, but I think that
   it's worth doing.
How were you planning on implementing it?  It's not too hard to
translate a unlink to a rename call, and move the file to some
directory; but handling (a) undeleting the inode, (b) security so that
users can't see other people's deleted files, and (c) automatically
deleting "deleted" files when the filesystem needs space, all starts
making the problem a lot harder....
