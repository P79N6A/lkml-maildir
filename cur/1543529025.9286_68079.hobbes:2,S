Hello!
    I have a problem...
    I use a Dell Optiplex GX: Pentium II, 350 MHz, 64 MByte RAM, Linux
2.2.1.
    I want to allocate a "large" amount of memory from inside of a
module. I repetitive use __get_free_pages function to allocate pairs of
2 pages.
    The maximum amount of memory I can allocate is 4MByte: 1024 pages,
this means 512 spreaded pairs of 2 continuous pages.
    I would like to reach 900-1000 pairs.
    Has anyone an idea how to get off of this limit?
Thanks in advance,
Cristian.
