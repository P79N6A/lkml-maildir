Hi,    
      I am very new to linux kernel driver development. I need to develop a 
driver for calling  BIOS routines like get device node. I could  call  it
in i386 architecture using the PnP driver. 
     But in x86_64 arch I couldn't see any support. Even I tried to
implement it similar to the i386. But there is no API get_cpu_gdt_table().
Is there any other way to get the cpu_gdt_table? or any other way to 
call the BIOS routines.
    Please help me on this.
