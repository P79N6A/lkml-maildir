It can't be Pass-through problem as the touchpad is not identified as Synaptics,
so it must be MUX...
Emmeran, what happens if you "cat /dev/input/mice" and try working the
touchpad and the trackball? Do you see anything when you use the touchpad?
If not, please #define DEBUG in i8042.c again and after reboot try using
touchpad first, then type something (so we'll see the point when you
stopped using the touchpad), move trackball and type something again and
post your dmesg one more time. This way we would see if there is anything
comes out from the touchpad in MUX mode, etc, etc.
And could you please post your /proc/bus/input/devices? 
Thank you,
Dmitry
