I don't like it, kswapd may fail balancing because there's a GFP_DMA
allocation that eat the last dma page, but we should not kill tasks if
we fail to balance in kswapd, we should kill tasks only when no fail
path exists (i.e. only during page faults, everything else in the kernel
has a fail path and it should never trigger oom).
If you move it in kswapd there's no way to prevent oom-killing from a
syscall allocation (I guess even right now it would go wrong in this
sense, but at least right now it's more fixable). I want to move the oom
kill outside the alloc_page paths. The oom killing is all about the page
faults not having a fail path, and in turn the oom killing should be
moved in the page fault code, not in the allocator. Everything else
should keep returning -ENOMEM to the caller.
So to me moving the oom killer into kswapd looks a regression.
