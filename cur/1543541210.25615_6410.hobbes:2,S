You may want to ask the people who are writing ReiserFS

The problem with the current 2.4 VM is that it is even
worse than 2.2 VM, which we are already ashamed about.
Also, some of the (extra) features in the new VM are
needed in order to be able to run a journaling filesystem
*and* have a stable - under load - system at the same time.
