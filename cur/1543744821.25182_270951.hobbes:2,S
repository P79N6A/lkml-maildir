Subject: [PATCH?] prevent loop infinite recursion
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

After "losetup /dev/loop0 /dev/loop0" I see a hard crash upon
access of /dev/loop0. And of course the same happens after
"losetup /dev/loop0 /dev/loop1; "losetup /dev/loop1 /dev/loop0"
Chris Spiegel reports a slightly different crash doing similar things.
The easiest fix is saying "don't do that then".
The patch below adds a (somewhat ugly) test for recursion.
Maybe someone can think of a nicer version.
