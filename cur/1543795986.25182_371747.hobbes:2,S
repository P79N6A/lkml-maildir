So can David's. You can use BIOS tables in which case you must compile the SPI core into the
kernel but you can also use spi_new_device which allows the SPI core to be built as a module (and
is how I am using it).

To my understanding David's core is DMA-safe. Yes there is a question mark over one of the helper
functions, but the _main_ functions _are_ DMA-safe.

Sorry I'm not sure what you mean here.

But also less flexibility. A core layer shouldn't _force_ a policy
on a bus driver. I am currently developing an adapter driver for David's system and I wouldn't say
that the core is making me do things I think the core should do. Please could you provide examples
of where you think Davids SPI core requires 'effort'.
