Dunno about this one.  I'm seeing some (totally different) NFS funnies
at present - pagecache data on the client is coming up zeroes under
memory pressure.  Trond mentioned that NFS recently went to kmap_atomic,
so there is a common thread there.

It misidentified the device.  How bizarre.  3c590 is 0x10B7, 0x5900
and 3c905C is 0x10B7, 0x9200.  lspci saw the 905C OK.  Possibly the
PCI device table walking got broken or miscompiled.  Works OK here,
as does NFS client on SMP+highmem.
