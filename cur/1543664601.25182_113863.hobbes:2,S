Subject: [PATCH] kbuild: do not run split-include for all compilations
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

When a rule in the top-level Makefile includes scripts as one
of the prerequisites it inherits FORCE, and thus is always build.
include/linux/autoconf.h recently included scripts hereby forcing
split-include to be run for each compilation.
Fix all rules that lists scripts as a prerequisite but did not list FORCE.
Fixed by listing the executable needed direct.
