There's a flurry of emails I haven't read yet.
I wanted to answer the direction question first
 test9 OK
 test10 OK
 test11 BROKEN
so that's where the break occurred.
I've gotta admit I was scared running the older
test kernels because somewhere in the series
the filesystem could be damaged and it bit me
bad on the first pass a couple of months ago.
I compiled the kernels under current full 2.4.0
and when rebooting to the test kernels tried
to get in, do the test, and get out as fast
as possible.

I made the same request to Jordan Mendelson yesterday, who has the same
problem.  Could you be so kind as to try to narrow down which kernel
version this broke on?  I have reports that it used to work on -test9
but doesn't now.  Could you try -test10, etc and let me know?
thanks,
