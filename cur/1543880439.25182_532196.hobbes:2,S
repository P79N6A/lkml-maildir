yeah. Another detail is that for global containers like uids, the 
statistics will have to be percpu_alloc()-ed, both for correctness 
(runqueues are per CPU) and for performance.
That's one reason why i dont think it's necessarily a good idea to 
group-schedule threads, we dont really want to do a per thread group 
percpu_alloc().
In fact for threads the _reverse_ problem exists, threaded apps tend to 
_strive_ for more performance - hence their desperation of using the 
threaded programming model to begin with ;) (just think of media 
playback apps which are typically multithreaded)
I dont think threads are all that different. Also, the 
resource-conserving act of using CLONE_VM to share the VM (and to use a 
different programming environment like Java) should not be 'punished' by 
forcing the thread group to be accounted as a single, shared entity 
against other 'fat' tasks.
so my current impression is that we want per UID accounting to solve the 
X problem, the kernel threads problem and the many-users problem, but 
i'd not want to do it for threads just yet because for them there's not 
really any apparent problem to be solved.
