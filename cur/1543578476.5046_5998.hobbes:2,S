Yup, that's what I thought... But the real question is, is this a
software/configuration problem or a hardware problem which can only be fixed by
physically changing something on the board?... As it is, as you call it,
'elusive', it is a b*tch to pinpoint the source of these problems...

Here they are (marked with ***):
grep -B2 -A2 transmit /var/log/messages:
    Jan 10 22:24:47 behemoth kernel: usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout 
    Jan 10 22:24:50 behemoth kernel: usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout 
*** Jan 10 22:56:51 behemoth kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out

Not tried yet, since I wanna use both CPU's :-).

I am, and did it a while ago. As far as I remember, it did not make it stop...
I'll try again (even though it is not a real solution, since that APIC is there
for a reason...)
