Yes, already that looks interesting. Do I have something going on with
acpi? This is before running Jack. I'm in Gnome.There are a lot of
these messages, but they've stopped. I suppose the 3997 is the delay?
That would coorespond with the info I sent earlier.

   I started up Jack, mounted my 1394 drives and started streaming a
little bit of data. Basicaly my ultra-light load test. I see nothing
new in dmesg yet. I'll keep watching.
Thanks,
Mark
