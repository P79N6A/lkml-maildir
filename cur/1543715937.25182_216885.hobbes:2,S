I believe he has set this up so that it won't compile correctly unless 
you have a source tree at /usr/src/linux, and then he uses the includes 
there. He has ignored being told this is not the proper way to do things.
It may be an unrelated problem, but I think he regards ever case where 
the kernel people didn't do things for his convenience as a bug, and 
writes his code to cause problems if you don't do it his way.
If you do audio burns it's worth fighting, they use DMA with the ATA: 
interface. For data the last time I used ide-scsi it was working again, 
although it's not the preferred way to operate. YMMV.
