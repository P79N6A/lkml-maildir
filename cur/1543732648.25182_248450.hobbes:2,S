It'd be something similar to what clearcase does (not that I like
clearcase, I hate it with a passion for other reasons!)
On such a system, one would have multiple virtual views mounted (by
root) under:
        /view/tar, /view/dpkg, /view/rpm, etc.
for every regular file /home/joe/blah.tar
the path /view/tar/home/joe/blah.tar/ is a directory where member of
the archives directly accessible.
old tools continue work as is. new tools can take a look on virtual
views for virtual access. 
Not sure how such a system would work with the dentry cache.
