Hello,
I have a fairly quick one: Is there an ioctl flag/call which can be used
to find out the "type" of the interface being used ?
I would like to somehow be able to tell in my application whether the
interface in question is of type ETHERNET or ATM or FRAME_RELAY etc.
Any/all help will be greatly appreciated.
