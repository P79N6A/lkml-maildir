Until we get more intelligence somewhere, do this:
    # cd /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-3
    # echo '2' > bConfigurationValue
    #
That makes the device use vendor-neutral protocols
to talk to the host, not MSFT-proprietary ones.  (It's
important to use the numbers from those messages; they
will change if you use different USB ports.)
Hmm ... maybe usbcore would be better off with a less
naive algorithm for choosing defaults.  Like, preferring
configurations without proprietary device protocols.
That'd solve every cdc-acm case, and likely others.
