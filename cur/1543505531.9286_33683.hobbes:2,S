Sorry to bother you with this, but CVS ISDN worked perfectly in
2.2.10-ac5 and is failing in this manner in 2.2.11 (this is separate
from the compile failure in isdn_audio.c I mentioned yesterday):
After the link has been up for a few seconds, and four or five
packets sent, I get this in the syslog:
billabong kernel: isdn_ppp_skb_push:under 4 5
...then the link passes no more packets. I can tear the link down,
start it up again, but the same happens. Here are the relevant parts
of .config:
CONFIG_ISDN=m
CONFIG_ISDN_PPP=y
CONFIG_ISDN_PPP_VJ=y
CONFIG_ISDN_MPP=y
# CONFIG_ISDN_AUDIO is not set
CONFIG_ISDN_DIVERSION=y
# CONFIG_ISDN_DRV_ICN is not set
# CONFIG_ISDN_DRV_LOOP is not set
# CONFIG_ISDN_DRV_PCBIT is not set
CONFIG_ISDN_DRV_HISAX=m
CONFIG_HISAX_EURO=y
# CONFIG_DE_AOC is not set
# CONFIG_HISAX_NO_SENDCOMPLETE is not set
# CONFIG_HISAX_NO_LLC is not set
# CONFIG_HISAX_1TR6 is not set
# CONFIG_HISAX_16_0 is not set
CONFIG_HISAX_16_3=y
All the best,
