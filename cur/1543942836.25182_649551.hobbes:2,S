thanks. Incidentally this same bug was reported and fixed yesterday, and 
that fix is upstream already. Could you please compare your solution to 
Yinghai Lu's fix below, and send us a patch for any further improvements 
(or cleanups) you might notice in that code? It seems to be almost the 
same fix as yours. (and hopefully it fixes your X problem too)

    x86: fix mttr trimming
    
    Pavel Emelyanov reported that his networking card did not work
    and bisected it down to:
    
    "
    The commit
    
      093af8d7f0ba3c6be1485973508584ef081e9f93
      x86_32: trim memory by updating e820
    
    broke my e1000 card: on loading driver says that
    
      e1000: probe of 0000:04:03.0 failed with error -5
    
    and the interface doesn't appear.
    "
    
    on a 32-bit kernel, base will overflow when try to do PAGE_SHIFT,
    and highest_addr will always less 4G.
    
    So use pfn instead of address to avoid the overflow when more than
    4g RAM is installed on a 32-bit kernel.
    
    Many thanks to Pavel Emelyanov for reporting and testing it.
