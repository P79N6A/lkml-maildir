Dug a bit further...
There was a trailing blank in Inaky's note as it arrived here, but it was
traveling with a Content-Type-Encoding: 8bit.  My guess is that some mail
software between vger and Oleg's inbox down-converted to 7bit.  Either that
mailer failed to insert a 'Content-Type-Encoding: quoted-printable' header when
it applied the quoted-printable )changing a trailing blank to =20) when
down-converting, or Oleg's mail reader (apparently Mozilla?) failed to heed the
C-T-E and convert the =20 back to the trailing blank it should have been.
I was there when all this MIME stuff was designed, and we covered all the
failure modes of stupid designers of mail software that we could think of.
We never considered the sorts of whitespace screw-ups we actually see today -
I think there was a "No designer could be THAT daft" blind-spot....
