Subject: Mac-buttons emulation broken in 2.4.0-test10

The mac_hid_mouse_emulate_buttons() in drivers/macintosh/mac_hid.c
which takes care of emulating multiple buttons on a mac doesn't
seem to be used anywhere. In fact, by doing a "grep -r mac_hid... *"
in the kernel's base directory yields only one result and it's
the one in mac_hid.c. Shouldn't this be called upon from the
keyboard and mouse handlers?
