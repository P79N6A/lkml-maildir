I disagree. They can manipulate the files a whole lot better than they can 
manipulate xattr's.
For example, you _could_ probably (but hey, maybe "tar" tries to strip
slashes off the end of filenames, so this might not work due to silly
reasons like that) back up a compound file with
	tar cvf file.tar file file/
although unpacking it would require that tar be taught about the thing. 
And you definitely could write a script to do the thing, ie even with an 
unmodified tar you could do
	tar cvf file-archive.tar file
	cd file
	tar cvf ../attribute-archive.tar .
which is a hell of a lot better than what you can do with the fsattr 
interfaces and unmodified legacy applications.
So one of the advantages of "dir-as-file/file-as-dir" is exactly that you
_can_ manipulate the data with legacy tools. Sure, things that traverse a
directory tree might need some (likely fairly trivial) modifications if
they really want to take advantage of the subfiles, but that's still
likely to be _much_ less of an issue than with fsattr's that have a 
totally different model entirely.
