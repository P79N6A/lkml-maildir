thanks Quentin, it looks good to me and i've applied the x86 bit to 
x86.git. (find the merged patch attached below)

your email client apparently line-wrapped this portion of the patch - i 
fixed it up manually (wasnt a big issue). Please see

Subject: Code clarification patch to Kprobes arch code
From: "Quentin Barnes" <qbarnes@gmail.com>
When developing the Kprobes arch code for ARM, I ran across some code
found in x86 and s390 Kprobes arch code which I didn't consider as
good as it could be.
Once I figured out what the code was doing, I changed the code
for ARM Kprobes to work the way I felt was more appropriate.
I've tested the code this way in ARM for about a year and would
like to push the same change to the other affected architectures.
The code in question is in kprobe_exceptions_notify() which
does:
====
          /* kprobe_running() needs smp_processor_id() */
          preempt_disable();
          if (kprobe_running() &&
              kprobe_fault_handler(args->regs, args->trapnr))
                  ret = NOTIFY_STOP;
          preempt_enable();
====
For the moment, ignore the code having the preempt_disable()/
preempt_enable() pair in it.
The problem is that kprobe_running() needs to call smp_processor_id()
which will assert if preemption is enabled.  That sanity check by
smp_processor_id() makes perfect sense since calling it with preemption
enabled would return an unreliable result.
But the function kprobe_exceptions_notify() can be called from a
context where preemption could be enabled.  If that happens, the
assertion in smp_processor_id() happens and we're dead.  So what
the original author did (speculation on my part!) is put in the
preempt_disable()/preempt_enable() pair to simply defeat the check.
Once I figured out what was going on, I considered this an
inappropriate approach.  If kprobe_exceptions_notify() is called
from a preemptible context, we can't be in a kprobe processing
context at that time anyways since kprobes requires preemption to
already be disabled, so just check for preemption enabled, and if
so, blow out before ever calling kprobe_running().  I wrote the ARM
kprobe code like this:
====
          /* To be potentially processing a kprobe fault and to
           * trust the result from kprobe_running(), we have
           * be non-preemptible. */
          if (!preemptible() && kprobe_running() &&
              kprobe_fault_handler(args->regs, args->trapnr))
                  ret = NOTIFY_STOP;
====
The above code has been working fine for ARM Kprobes for a year.
So I changed the x86 code (2.6.24-rc6) to be the same way and ran
the Systemtap tests on that kernel.  As on ARM, Systemtap on x86
comes up with the same test results either way, so it's a neutral
external functional change (as expected).
This issue has been discussed previously on linux-arm-kernel and the
Systemtap mailing lists.  Pointers to the by base for the two
discussions:
