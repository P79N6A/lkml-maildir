The wbinvd in the mtrr handling is basically cpu specific deep magic from
the chip documentation.

We need to work out how to fix the pci dma interfaces on the PC. The PPro
has an interesting errata where writes to combining memory can pass writes
to uncached memory. That means to fix it I have to lob in a locked store
or other workaround. That costs clocks - and isnt needed on pre ppro boxes,
ditto the spin_unlock using xchg fix isnt needed except on ppro.
That raises the question of whether x86 should seperate the "386" "486" ..
kernels by adding "Generic" for building a kernel that has all the work
arounds for everyones randomly buggy processors
