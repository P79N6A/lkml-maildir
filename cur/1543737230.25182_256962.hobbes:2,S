Apparently, the only way to attach the Compaq RA4000, or RA4100 array to a
linux box is through their
"66Mhz 64bit Fibre Channel card".  I have several of these boxes, and would
love to make use of them with a modern Fibre Channel card family such as the
Emulex LightPulse.  There is an alpha quality LightPulse 
driver hosted on SourceForge for the 2.6  kernel that I'm quite happy with.
:-)  I can even see the 
controller of the RA4000 with it.  I can't, however, see LUN's that array
has.  The array shows up as a type 12 SCSI device.  There is another driver,
for the above mentioned "66Mhz 64bit Fibre Channel card" that works quite
well for >>ONLY<< that card, and if I use the Compaq card and driver, the
LUN magically becomes visible as a SCSI device.  In my round about fashion,
I'm wondering if it is possible to get the bits of the diver for the Compaq
card broken out into a separate driver, which would make it possible to 
talk to the RAID controller with my Emulex card.  I'd rather have everything
on one SAN.
