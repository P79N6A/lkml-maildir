Sorry, but let's be realistic, this type of warning would have *NEVER*
been addressed if we kept the status quo -- your modifications to read
the wwpn/wwnn would have never been submitted, everybody would have
kept going on blistfully ignorant of the issue.  Changes such as these
are a common Linux upstream idiom...
So, meeting in the middle, with the NVRAM bits restored along with
some ability for the user to *knowingly* recognize the problem, I take
it, is not going to work for you?
