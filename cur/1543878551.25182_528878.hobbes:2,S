I do agree, and yes, I/O scheduling seems to not have suffered from the 
choice although I must say I'm not sure how much use each I/O scheduler 
individualy sees.
If one CPU scheduler can be good enough then it would better to just 
have that one, but well, yes, maybe it can't. I certainly believe any 
one scheduler can't avoid breaking down onder some condition. Demand is 
just too varied.
I find it interesting that you see SD as a server scheduler and I guess 
deterministic behaviour does point in that direction somewhat. I would 
be enabling it on the desktop though, which probably is _some_ argument 
on having multiple schedulers.
Rene.
