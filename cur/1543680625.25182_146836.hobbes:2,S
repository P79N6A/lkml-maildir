The problem is IMHO code where some pretty fragile things are handled, 
especially file systems. I'd say: DO the paranoia checks if some fragile 
things are involved like key structures of the file system that can take 
_permanent_ damage. If you check for a NULL pointer you still have the 
chance to properly leave the system in a consistent state and no user 
will be happy if his filesystem goes messy just because someone saved a 
check to have nicer code, even if the original of the NULL pointer 
wasn't his fault, even if it's a developing version. So if the check 
isn't a total performace disaster, do it whenever permanent damage could 
occur.
On other sections where, let's say just a user memory allocation would 
crash, checks could be ommitted, because it isn't that fatal and leaves 
no permanent destruction.
Just my opinion :)
