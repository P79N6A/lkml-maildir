Here's a version of the VGA control code that actually works. It helps
if I pci_enable() the device before using it. There was nothing wrong
with the routing code.
I can also control multiple cards on the same bus by turning on/off
their response to IO space and then enabling VGA via the standard
ports. I can use this to move my console from card to card.
I have this code in drivers/pci because it needs to know add/remove
from hotplug. Is there a better way to structure it? Note that this is
not a VGA device, it is just a mechanism for controlling which VGA
device is active.
Another item I need to add is generating an initial hotplug event for
each secondary card. This event has to happen even if there is a card
specific driver loaded. The event will be used to run the reset
program needed by secondary cards.
