It is modified by settimeofday (kernel/time.c:do_sys_settimeofday).
And, if you look at this function you'll notice that it additionally
adjusts the kernel's clock the first time it is called to handle
rtcs running with local time.

I guess the semantics should be similar to the two variables
timezone and daylight in libc.  That is, timezone holds the
offset without DST correction and daylight contains a value
!= 0 to specify that DST is sometimes in effect.
Note though, that struct timeval is different:
tm_gmtoffs (present in glibc) always contains the offset
including DST and tm_isdst says that DST is currently in effect.

That depends on what your rc-scripts do at startup.

Unix works with UTC everywhere.  Only when printing times they are
converted to local time.  Don't try to break this.  It'll hurt.

You could add code to fat to interpret the value of tz_dsttime and
add DST detection for eg DST_MET.  The rules for Germany have been the
same for a long time so it should be possible without too much hassle.
Hint: maybe the code is already present in xBSD.
