I was having the same problem as you describe. It turned out to be the
Ethernet adapter that was using DMA and continued to transfer packets
from the wire to memory after a system reboot.
I solved the problem by putting a "ifconfig eth0 down" just before the
call to reboot in the corresponding rc script. Newer versions of
sysvinit do this automatically.
