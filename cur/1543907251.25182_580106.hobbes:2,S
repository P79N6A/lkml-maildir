I was basing the raw mode on comments in the DHCP source code about  
problems in older Linux kernels with sending packets to  
255.255.255.255 via normal IP.  The DHCP source code therefore wants  
to send raw packets (SOCKET_PACKET) (down to the ethernet addressing  
info).  I guess I thought I would need to do this too to fit in with  
the existing source code.
I'll give it a try to see whether packets sent to 255.255.255.255 can  
make it to ppp with the IP address unchanged.
Thanks,
