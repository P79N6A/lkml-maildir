I thought that opening procfs file would do mntget() that will pin super
block of host file system. Wouldn't it?

Yes, I agree.

It looks unnatural to return constant from ->next(), hiding mutable part
inside.
Also code duplication in ->next() and ->stop(). No objective reasons,
but new interface will provide more clean (and intuitive to me)
separation of error reporting, iteration context, and iteration cookie.
