Is there any reason the random.c code in 2.0.36 shouldn't be modularized.
Apart from "used by stuff in kernel not yet modularized".
I had to export get_random_bytes from an old kernel binary that didn't
export it (but which is the only kernel to work with the serial ports
on these vx boards). So I modularized random.c fairly trivially, and it
didn't seem to hurt. But I didn't look closely at the code to see what
problems a second copy of the functioanlity would cause.
(it was to support a backport of hisax.c on top of isdn.c)
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/config.h> 
...
#ifdef MODULE
int
init_module(void)
{
  void rand_initialize(void);
  return 0;
}
#endif
#ifdef MODULE
void
cleanup_module (void)
{
}
#endif        
Incidently - alan - 2.0.36 is showing signs of having the elusive
networking memory leak in conjunction with multicast (mrouted) and
possibly scsi (adaptec).  Wasn't something like this squashed a bit ago?
