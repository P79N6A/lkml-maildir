Indeed that's the crux of the matter, we need to express a trinary
state "end of scatterlist, next entry is linear, next entry is
indirect" plus a pointer for the indirect case.
Generally, Jens was doing a good job cooking up the patch that
implemented this fully and I took care of making sure tricky
ports like sparc64 built cleanly etc.
He went away for a few days, but when he gets back we should seriously
work on integrating his work.
I fully recognize Alan's m68k on-stack alignment concern.  The on-stack
cases are troublesome in other ways as well, and I think therefore the
way to move forward is to convert those to some kind of dynamic scheme.
Usually such code is working in a locked context on some object
(crypto instance, for example) and thus the scatterlist chunk can
be embedded into that object for ensured alignment.
