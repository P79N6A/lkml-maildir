Subject: RFC: i386: kill !4KSTACKS

4Kb kernel stacks are the future on i386, and it seems the problems it 
initially caused are now sorted out.
I'd like to:
- get a patch into the next -mm that unconditionally enables 4KSTACKS
- if there won't be new reports of breakages, send a patch to
  completely remove !4KSTACKS for 2.6.13 or 2.6.14
The only drawback is that REISER4_FS does still depend on !4KSTACKS.
I told Hans back in March that this has to be changed.
Is there any ETA until that all issues with 4Kb kernel stacks in Reiser4 
will be resolved?
If not people using Reiser4 might have to decide whether to switch the 
filesystem or the architecture...
