Hallo,
i have one process, which i want to run on a cpu (> CPU0). The special
thing here is, that this process is very time critical and  should NOT
be interrupted by anything (cpusets/cpus_allowed would not be enough).
(the process is not doing any system calls and is communicating to the
world by shared memory).
so i wanted to run the process on a CPU1, when all irqs are disabled and
so the process could not be interrupted.
I tried very simple to 
(1) migrate all processes to CPU0 by cpu_set_allowed
(2) gave my process (running on CPU1) the highest priority
(3) run schedule and make sure that the irqs are disables
(disable_irqs()) 
...
but well, it didnt work ...
actually i wanted to ask if this could work and if there is maybe sth
like this already somewhere implemented (or easily adaptable).
thx
patrick
