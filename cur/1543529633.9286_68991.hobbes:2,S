True statement.  Here's a structure copy example from aic7xxx.c.
  9035  #if 0
  9036      p->sc = *sc;
  9037  #else
  9038      memcpy(&p->sc, sc, sizeof(*sc));
  9039  #endif
If you take your hands off the wheel (don't tell the compiler exactly 
what to do), new snapshots will generate a libcall instead of using
an internally defined inline memcpy() as it used to.
I can find no doc which states that the compiler must inline this type
of operation, and the (highly qualified) people I queried offline about
it agree that it's up to the compiler.  If this is true, it means that
it's a coding bug to use this kind of construct in the kernel [1]. Or?

1. even if you put memcpy() in a lib, nothing dictates that the compiler
can't call bcopy().. or a whole slew of libc functions for that matter.
