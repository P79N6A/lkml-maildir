Oh. *NOW* I see.  You don't actually *CLAIM* it's your code, you just
rename it in a misleading manner to create the impression.
"Yes, we asked the author to rename it GNU/Wombat, even though the GNU
project didn't actually do anything other than GNU/Rename it and then GNU/Borg it..."
I think you need to call the guys in Redmond, and ask if they could please
use the name 'GNU/Innovation"....
(And yes, I *used* to have a lot of respect for the GNU crew....)
