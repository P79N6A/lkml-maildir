That darn printk again.  You wouldn't believe...
calibrate_migration_costs() causes a storm of boot-time output and I think
all those printks should be removed before this code goes up to Linus.

It's currently %d in my tree.  This is why I converted x86's cpu_khz from
unsigned long to unsigned, to match x86_64's.
