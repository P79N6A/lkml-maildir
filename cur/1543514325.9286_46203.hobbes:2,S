Yes of course, what I like to say was:
No headroom isn't a bug which drop the connection or make it unstable, since
we have the workaround.
BTW: What about routing, where the needed headroom is realloced ?
What I mean:
e.g. a eth0 and a syncppp interface.
A packet comes from the ethernet, the ethernet devices allocates the skb for
it (I think with no additional headroom,  because it don't know about the
destination of this packet) then it is send to the network stack, which
send it to the syncppp device.
Which function allocates skb with the right headroom ?

dev->hard_header_len
I looked trough the code and don't find a place, where ppp increase the
dev->hard_header_len for its need, but maybe the ETH_HLEN (14) is allways
bigger as the ppp headers ?
Only in isdn_net.c dev->hard_header_len is calculated:
dev->hard_header_len = ETH_HLEN + max_hlhdr_len;
max_hlhdr_len is the max from all hardware drivers (for HiSax 4, but this is
only used with X.75, with other low layer protocols here is no additional
header.)

I heared similar problems with ppp over ethernet and normal ppp.
