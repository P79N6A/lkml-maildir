 My ibook has always been able to suspend to RAM.  For a long while,
uptime was shown as the time since the last boot.  At some point,
maybe about a year ago, this was "corrected" to show time since boot
_less_ time suspended.
 To be clear, the ibook suspends when I close the lid and resumes
when I open it.  Uptime used to be convenient, because I could work
out when I'd last booted.
