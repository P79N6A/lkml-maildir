Hi,
We have a problem with ip_masqurading set up as a firewall. When someone
runs a stealth scan from the masquraded net to the outside net, it will
very fast consume all available masqurade ports. The result is a nasty
DoS for all adresses on the masquraded net.
Is there any possibly limit on masqurade ports per source adress?
This would effectively stop the scan, and limit the DoS to the offender
only.
I guess this problem also affects 2.2 kernels as well.
Is there anyone else that has been hit by this problem?
Best Regards
Daniel Ryde, System Administrator
