I'm pretty sure an economist would describe debugging as wasted time
(non-value-add). The point being, of course, that the original coder's
mistakes caused someone else to have to waste time, time that could
otherwise have been spent adding value, fixing the problem.
However, it might be phrased more diplomatically in this context, like
"because you are sacrificing time that could be spent adding features,
to fix somebody else's mistakes".
