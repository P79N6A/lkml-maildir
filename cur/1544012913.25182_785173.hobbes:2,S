This patch also didn't apply.
I also couldn't reproduce this warning here [1].
[1] gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-44)
Ingo,
I've added almost 600 patches on my merge tree, several of them that I've
merged recently from driver maintainers. I've already fixed all warnings I got
here with allmodconfig.
Could you please double check if the patches you've added on your tree are still needed?
Thanks,
Mauro.
