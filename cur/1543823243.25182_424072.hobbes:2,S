One of the gen2 basic tests checks for zero-length regions and barfs if
someone creates them.  There's no language in IBNA that forbids
zero-length regions (I'll take a look at the spec itself to be sure), so
it's possible that the test is wrong.  On the other hand, a zero-length
region doesn't seem terribly useful.
