If it wasn't for SMP, I'd say try to boot with "disableapic", but I have
no clues whether this will break SMP or wreak other havoc. 
At least, since around 2.4.10, booting my Uniprocessor Duron on a
Gigabyte 7ZXR board breaks at the same occasion. At the time I reported
that, I was told to take this to the XFree guys, then that IOAPIC stuff
on UP was unstable. 
I tend to believe that some bug sneaked in around those 2.4.10 versions.
Can you tell what kernel versions were the last that work OK for you
when switching from X11 to virtual console?
