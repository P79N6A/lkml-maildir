Error messages would be interesting... So far we have _both_ 2.95 and 2.91
involved, raid and non-raid alike. Just fscking peachy... OK, let's try
to eliminate ext2 changes (if that helps we have a big problem somewhere,
but that's at least something):

Notice that if reverting that change stops the fs corruption we _still_
have a problem - the only case when it could help is if something touches
an inode allocated by get_empty_inode() before it gets included into the
hash.
BTW, folks, while we are looking at the configurations - how about highmem
and SMP vs. UP?
