Paul,
I'd previously reported a problem where the PCI subsystem 
was getting inited before the memory subsystem. In the unusual
case of an EEH failure, this resulted in a crash in kmalloc,
which I hacked around with a if(!mem_init_done).
You mentioned that the sequence of inits seemed wrong, that the 
PCI init should be done later, after the memory init. I think
I agree; but when I took a very very quick look at the code, there 
was no obvious hook in later init to move the PCI init over to. 
Are you pursuing this further? Should I dig into it?  Any bright
ideas? Am I missing something obvious?  
There are several spots in in the powerpc PCI init code where 
a boot_mem alloc is used instead of kmalloc, and this boot_mem is 
then hacked around in the case of a PCI hotplug remove.  It would 
be nice to fix this...
