Subject: [PATCH] procfs dependency in drivers/net/wan/comx.c

Hi.
The MultiGate (COMX) synchronous serial boards driver (drivers/net/wan/comx.c)
is dependent on procfs support (due to an #error define). This is not
mentioned in the help text or reflected in the Config.in.
The first of the patches below changes drivers/net/wan/Config.in to
make CONFIG_COMX depend on CONFIG_PROC_FS. Alternatively or additionally
the second patch can be applied which includes the dependency information
in the Configure.help text for CONFIG_COMX. I'll leave the decision to
wiser minds.

+  You must say Y to "/proc file system support" (CONFIG_PROC_FS) to
+  use this part of the kernel.

   If you want to compile this as a module, say M and read
   Documentation/modules.txt. The module will be called comx.o.
