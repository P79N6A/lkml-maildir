Dear Linux community.
I was just wondering if anyone is actively maintaining
drivers/video/display/display-sysfs.c, or the display class.  I am
looking at the version in 2.6.24.3 and I noticed that it hasn't been
updated since 2.6.22.  Just curious if anyone is maintaining this
actively?
I also didn't find any code in the drivers/video sub-directory that is
actually using the "display class".  I found some examples and
possible updates from James Simmons on the web, but it seems like
nothing has been rolled into the main branch.  I also found some bug
fixes on the web (dated early '07), but again, nothing officially
rolled into 2.6.24.3.
I'm asking because I would like to do some work (and possibly expand)
the display class, just wanted get some background information before
I get started.
Just curious.  Thanks for all your support.  Please CC

thanks.
