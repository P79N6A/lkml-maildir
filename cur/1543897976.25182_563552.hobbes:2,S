asm-powerpc/elf.h included sched.h, and it in turn was being included by 
something else.  With the cleanups in this patch, asm-powerpc/elf.h is 
no longer being included, so io-workarounds.c needs kernel/sched.h for a 
declaration of init_mm.
Similarly with the others; they all failed to compile without linux/sched.h.
