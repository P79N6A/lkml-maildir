Subject: [PATCH] Lguest launcher, child starving parent
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Glauber noticed long delays between hitting a key, and seeing data come
up on the virtual console.  Looking into this, I found that the
wake_parent routine that reads from all devices was actually starving
out the parent after sending the parent a signal to wake up.
The thing is, the child which takes the console input is recognized by
the scheduler as an interactive process.  The parent, doesn't do so
much, so it is recognized more as a CPU hog. So the child easily gets a
higher priority than the parent.
So when the child receives data from the console, it sends a signal to
the parent and then does another select.  The problem is that the select
doesn't actually read from the device, and will return immediately since
their is still data pending until it is read.  But it's the parent that
reads the data.  So the child actually starves the parent from reading
the data by spinning and waiting for it to read the data.
The fix I implemented was to have the child wait for a response from the
parent before going on. Since there was already communication between
the parent and child via a pipe, I used that. This time, the data
returned by the pipe is either everything went fine (fd == -1) or the
device should be ignored (fd >= 0).
