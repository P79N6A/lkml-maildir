Silly me, it was a trick question. I should have known better than to
fall into that trap. See the responses you got from other people already
and go check out the archives.
No even better, here's a link:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt
If you still wish to argue for this, please take me off the CC list.
To be honest, I don't think anyone on linux-kernel is interested in yet
another round of this one.
Cheers,
Jes
