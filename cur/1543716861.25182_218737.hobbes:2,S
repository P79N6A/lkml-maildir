Anything that uses current() or the like will be unhappy, though it
may work half the time. So just about anything binary-only is liable
to hit it. We can catch most of this by adding "4KSTACKS" to the
global build flags, but I think stuff like the Nvidia wrapper layer
shoots itself in the foot here by silently ignoring this check.
