Reiser4 has a number of great (IMO) things like file as directory, 
atomic operations, different kinds of stat data, fibretions, etc, etc. 
Some thing is not yet ready - doesn't matter. Some of this is of general 
interest, some is Reiser4-dedicated.
New interfaces are needed to allow users to utilize that all. My point 
is that the things that are of general interest must not be 
Reiser4-only. For example, I should have a possibility to implement 
files-like-dir in _another_ FS using the same interfaces that Reiser4 
uses. That's all I wanted to say.
The other question that it may be difficult to foresee everything and it 
may make sense to move some things upper in future.
