i suspect it's the generic_synchronize_irq() change. Does -Q4 boot?:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc1-bk4-Q4
-Q4 reverts this change. (this doesnt solve the problems Scott noticed
though.)
another solution would be to boot Q3 with preempt_hardirqs=0 and then
turn on threading for all IRQs but the keyboard.
