2.2.0 final locks up on my machine the same way as 2.2.0-pre8-ac1 and
2.2.0-pre9 did (I posted the error on the list few days ago).
Again it was while working with X server, again load was going up all the
time (but 'top' didn't show anything suspicious). Again it was not
possible to ctrl-alt-del and the machine was not visible by network. Some
processes worked, some (like cp -R with linux sources -- it caused bad fs
errors (duplicate blocks)) were locked. 
It all started when xfmail locked up somehow and it wasn't possible to
kill it (with signal 9 of course). ps didn't show it was a zombie. 
Again, the only way to get out of this was alt-sysrq-s, alt-sysrq-u,
alt-sysrq-b...
And again, back to 2.2.0-pre7-ac5
