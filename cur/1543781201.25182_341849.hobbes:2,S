Having an IDE card with one of these chipsets has left me with a bit of
a quandry. I've seen 2 different patch, both seemingly not going
anywhere.
1. Alan Cox's IDE driver that was included in his ac patchset, which
   seems to have died at 2.6.11ac7.
2. A brief visit from a SCSI IDE driver in Andrew Mortons mm patchset.
   It lived a brief but noted life before being taken out without any
   reason (that I spotted) in 2.6.12-rc4-mm1
Now, I'd like to upgrade my kernel to cover the security patches
releases since 11ac7 but... do I extract the ac driver or the mm driver
and try to use it? Will my data be eaten? Is there any chance of seeing
either driver in the kernel, proper?
Just wondering which way to go and stuff. :/
