This is sad and needs to be fixed. A possibly fix is to remove and later on
block messages using a character set that suggests that the message cannot be
read and understood by english speaking people.

As I did not receive any messages using japanese encoding before I have now
started to filter this encoding because even if I could display the characters
correctly I could not understand them. If a english spammer hits the list I
will probably introduce content based filtering ('make money fast').
