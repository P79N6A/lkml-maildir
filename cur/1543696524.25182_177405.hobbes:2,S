  Hello Peng,
I found your mail posting via google, because I do have the same
problems as you and was looking for a solution:
I have an Asus M3N that is supposed to support 1GB of memory.  I
bought it with 512MB, and everything worked fine,  Then I bought a
memory upgrade of another 512MB, and as soon as I plug it in, I get
two problems:
- without anything else, i.e., using the full 1GB of memory, the
  system is unusably slow (takes some 5-10 minutes just to boot).
  The main problem seems to be the hard disk, things that do not need
  the disk seem to work OK (I didn't try much - the system really is
  unusable...)
- I can restrict the memory usage with, e.g., mem=992M.  Then
  immediately the speed is back - but the pcmcia card slot no longer
  works. Same is true for the sound.
I'm (trying to) post this to the LKML - not sure if it's possible, as
I'm not subscribed.  But if soeone needs more info I'm willing to test
stuff out.
Best,
  Pit
