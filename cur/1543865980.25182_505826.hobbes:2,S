Don't be silly. AIO isn't an event. AIO is an *action*.
The event part is hopefully something that doesn't even *happen*.
Why do people ignore this? Look at a web server: I can pretty much 
guarantee that 99% of all filesystem accesses are cached, and doing them 
as "events" would be a total and utter waste of time.
You want to do them synchronously, as fast as possible, and you do NOT 
want to see them as any kind of asynchronous events.
Yeah, in 1% of all cases it will block, and you'll want to wait for them. 
Maybe the kevent queue works then, but if it needs any more setup than the 
nonblocking case, that's a big no.
