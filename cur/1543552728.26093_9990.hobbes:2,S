It makes you wonder...
Having been a /real/ breakin, I would have thought MS would have hushed
any kind of press release.
The other side may be that the culprit tried to blackmail MS after the
fact.
If Bill said 'screw you' to the blackmailer and made the press release,
we should see the source on web sites soon.  Then we can see how bad it
really is.  Maybe even fix it.
