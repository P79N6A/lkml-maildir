Uh, that's more an exception where we can't give guarantees because of
very specific hardware setups, and it would be an additional "change"
event. There are valid cases for this, but only a _very_ few.
There is absolutely no reason not to do it right with the "add" event,
just because we are too lazy to solve it proper the current code. It's
just so broken by design, what we are doing today. :)
