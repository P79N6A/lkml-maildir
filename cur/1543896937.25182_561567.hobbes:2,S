If I had all the hardware that tasklets touch, I'd start doing it. (look
for more patches from me that do this for the hardware I do have :-)

I'll have to add a clean up patch. A lot of the output from that came
from me moving existing code.  So I'll have to clean up the existing
code first so that checkpatch.pl doesn't complain about it.  I prefer a
patch that moves code to do nothing but that, move code and not even add
clean ups to it.  So the simple solution is, add patch to clean up (will
do).
Also this:
   void tasklet_schedule(struct tasklet_struct *t)
   {
           WARN_ON_ONCE(!ktaskletd_wq);
           queue_work(ktaskletd_wq, &t->work);
   }
   EXPORT_SYMBOL(tasklet_schedule);
produces
   PATCH: tasklets-to-workqueues.patch:259:
   FILE: linux-2.6-test/kernel/tasklet_work.c:30:
   +EXPORT_SYMBOL(tasklet_schedule);
So I guess that blank line is not acceptable?
and should be:
   void tasklet_schedule(struct tasklet_struct *t)
   {
           WARN_ON_ONCE(!ktaskletd_wq);
           queue_work(ktaskletd_wq, &t->work);
   }
   EXPORT_SYMBOL(tasklet_schedule);
I'll fix that up.

Should I just put in the prologue from the first series, or slim it down
a bit so people don't need to read the whole thing every time? I can
just put in the stuff that's relevant and leave out the "history".
Thanks,
