In my thinkpad z60m case. On 2.6.24 kernels pressing "thinkvantage" key is 
seen by acpid like this:
Mar 13 08:27:48 tarm acpid: received event "ibm/hotkey HKEY 00000080 00001018"
Mar 13 08:27:48 tarm acpid: notifying client 4071[126:126]
Mar 13 08:27:48 tarm acpid: notifying client 4096[0:0]
Mar 13 08:27:48 tarm acpid: notifying client 4230[0:0]
Mar 13 08:27:48 tarm acpid: completed event "ibm/hotkey HKEY 00000080 
00001018"
(this log was done while X was running + some kde apps).
Now under git kernel there is no such event. X has nothing to do with it since 
I tested without X running, too.
