I believe the second solution would be best.  We want to only have
hardware specific code in the fbdev drivers (well, as much as allows).

I think registering fbcon as a PM client and doing the above when the
fbdev suspend/resume hooks are called should work.  A memory backup is
worked on until the resume is run and the backup is restored to the
display.
So the fbdev drivers would register PM with fbcon, not PCI, correct?
