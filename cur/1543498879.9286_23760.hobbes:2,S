With those boxes that keep crashing, I know for a fact that there are a
couple kiddies scanning it and poking at it.  They've already tried all
the common accounts, port scanned, SYN flooded, attempted to do FTP PASV
scanning, and half a dozen other stupid exploits.  I'm wondering if
there's some new exploit that I haven't seen around yet.

Do those look like anything important?  I only seem them on these two
servers.  There are a couple other messages that seem to come up every
couple days as well (but only recently).
