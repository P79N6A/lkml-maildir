I don't really understand what is bad here. The 'unlikely' and 'if'
trace implementation looks quite elegant to me. Yes, they generate
10kbyte spaghetti monsters (in C) for a simple WARN_ON_ONCE(),
but probably we should just remove a few unlekely() from the WARN_*
code, and I'm not sure it's even worth it. There would be no direct
speedup.
And it took only one line to disable.
