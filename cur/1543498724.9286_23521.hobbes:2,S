FYI, the usual "blue screen" is:
Microsoft (R) Windows NT (TN) Version 4.0 (Build 1381: Service Pack 3).
*** STOP: 0x00000078 (0x00000000,0x00000000,0x00000000,0x00000000)
PHASE0EXCEPTION
CPUID:GenuineIntel 6.5.2 irql:1  SYSVER 0xf0000565
This sure tells one hell of a lot. I'd much rather have:
 "qlogicfc.c: got a null value out of handle_ptrs, this sucks", actual
error message from a Linux SCSI driver.
Cheers,
