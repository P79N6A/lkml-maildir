How often does this happen?

My patches
"ieee1394: nodemgr: switch to kthread api, replace reset semaphore" and
"ieee1394: nodemgr: convert nodemgr_serialize semaphore to mutex"
may be relevant. They are included in git-ieee1394.patch.
Could you revert them individually and test? It should be possible to
just "patch -p1 -R < ...." the following patchfiles:
http://me.in-berlin.de/~s5r6/linux1394/updates/2.6.18-rc5/patches/119-ieee1394-nodemgr-convert-nodemgr_serialize-semaphore-to-mutex.patch
If the problem persists, also revert
http://me.in-berlin.de/~s5r6/linux1394/updates/2.6.18-rc5/patches/118-ieee1394-nodemgr-switch-to-kthread-api--replace-reset-semaphore.patch
If that does not help, install them again and unapply all ieee1394
patches from -mm. If you have the time.
Thanks a lot,
