Yes, that's what I'm proposing that we do.  My original plan was to
use an incompat flag that would guarantee that there would be enough
space for likely short-term new inode fields, but perhaps it doesn't
have to be an incompat flag.  At least in theory it could be a compat
flag, and then we release a new e2fsprogs which enforces the guarantee
that at least that much space is reserved in every single inode, and
offers to remove one or more EA's in order to satisfy that guarantee.  
There is a chance that someone who has a filesystem with the compat
feature enabled, a kernel has the support for high-resolution
time-stamps, and an old e2fsprogs will get screwed, but only if the EA
space is totally filled up.  But maybe that's an acceptable risk, and
the worst that will happen is that make(1) will get confused.

Ah, it sounds like you're thinking the same thing I am.  OK, that
seems like a reasonable compromise.  We are taking a bit of a
shortcut, but it seems reasonable to assume that distro's will have
the right version of e2fsprogs if they want to use this feature; if
they don't users won't be able to enable the new compat flag anyway,
which means the chances of the user noticing a real problem is pretty
low.
