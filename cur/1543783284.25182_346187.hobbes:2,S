I know, that's a problem...

Well, if lost < 1, than we have a problem. And maybe the better idea really is 
to keep offset_delay. I simply wanted to stay as close as possible to the 
original code.

OK, now I see...
Yes, so of course, using setup_pit_timer in init_pmtmr makes a lot of sense...
(But my mistake should not influence more than the first two jiffies, I think)

Yes, the only real differences are the two points mentioned in my first 
mail... I only wanted to help you fixing these.

Well, that seems to be fine. If you want somebody to have a look over your 
final patch, feel free to mail me...

Yes, I am testing the mainline kernel, and I don't have any problems with time 
drift...

Well, I don't think I'll have enough spare time to test dynamic tick 
extensively, but maybe I'll have a look at them this evening...

You are surely right, I used my simple macro because I am not _that_ familiar 
with LATCH and CALIBRATE_LATCH and thus used the most intuitive way. So maybe 
I should have defined PMTMR_TICKS_PER_JIFFY like you assigned 
pm_ticks_per_jiffy (why did you use a static and constant variable and not a 
macro?):
#define PMTMR_TICKS_PER_JIFFY (PMTMR_EXPECTED_RATE / (CALIBRATE_LATCH/LATCH))
