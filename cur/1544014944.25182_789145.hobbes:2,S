Actually, at least at one point, it counted the number of newline
characters in the assembly string to estimate how many instructions
are contained inside.
It actually needs to know exaclty how many instructions are in there,
to emit proper far branches and stuff like that, for some cpus.
Since they never added an (optional) way to actually tell the compiler
this critical piece of information, so I guess the newline hack is the
best they could come up with.
