I'm currently running 2.4.1 with Maciej's patch-2.4.0-io_apic-4. Additionally,
I disabled focus_processor in apic.c to get rid of some network delays. Flood
pings both from and to this system do not cause any problems, other than making
the streaming audio sound a bit choppy...
Box is a dual-celeron (466, non-overclocked) BP-6 with two ne2k (Winbond
W89C940 based) cards sharing an interrupt.  
Maybe that works for you as well?
Cheers//Frank
