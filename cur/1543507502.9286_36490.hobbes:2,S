We are running Linux clients in a mixed environment of Solaris (2.6) and 
AIX (4.3) NFS servers. Recently, although nothing has changed on the Linux
clients (kernel 2.2.2 stock), we are having the following problem:
1) Create a file 'bla' on the NFS server as a user. Make the file g+wr
2) 'touch bla' as a user in the same group. You get "Operation not permitted"
Help!!
