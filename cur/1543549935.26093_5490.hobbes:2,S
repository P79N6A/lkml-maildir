I am having problems with lockups on an SMP box running 2.4.0-test9-pre7 for 
weeks now. I am using it as a network monitoring machine and I am using the 
same software on a box running kernel 2.2.17 with no problems. The error I am 
receiveing on the 2.4.0-test9-pre7 box is as follows: 
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference.
NMI Watchdog detected lockup on CPU1.
The System I am using is : 
Dual Pentium III 800
Super Micro P6DGU
Slackware 7.1
