Hi all.
This weekend i've using ip alias to setup a firewall (now called as fw)
on my University. The idea is all my machines connected behind the fw,
and the fw had all valid IP's and redirect packs via portfw only to the
specific servers and services in the internal machines. All this
machines (internally) will have B Class reserved ip numbers, and the fw
does an masquerade of the packets to send the answers to the INet
clients.
This is my situation. I have the portfw working, all http packs (for
example) that go to 200.xxx.xxx.15 goes to my 172.18.xxx.xxx machine.
But i cannot do the reverse with the packs. I run the ipchains masq
rule, using the virtual adapter (eth4:3, for exemple), and close all
doors in the real adapter (eth4). The packs don't go back. Opening the
firewall ports, and using a packet sniffer besides the fw and the
router, i saw all packs outgoing with the ip number of my real adapter,
not with the virtual one.
This happens with all kinds of services i use, not just http.
The question: Is this a ``feature'' or a bug? If this works, sorry for
this post, and please if you know how to do this, send me in PVT, if you
wish. If this is a bug, i'll pleasured to test any workaround and/or
fix.
The system is a Slack 4.0, ipchains 1.3.8, kernel 2.2.10 all modular.
Sorry for the long mail. Flames in PVT, please.
Thanks in advance.
