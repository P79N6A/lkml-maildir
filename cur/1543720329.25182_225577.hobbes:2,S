I'd like to thank-you for pointing out cpus_addr() to me several months
ago, when I unwittingly proposed to replace it, with something else of
a different name, doing the same thing.
I agree it is not legitimate - to the extent that it remains, the cleanup
of cpumasks is not yet complete.  Though, with my patch set of this week,
I think we're making good progress.
I am a little puzzled at the strength of your latest objections to it.
For all I know, it may well be your own invention.  It's been there a
while, since before my time with this code.
