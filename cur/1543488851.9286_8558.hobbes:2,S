When Linux was first written it was a Macro-kernel, plain and true. 
Everything the kernel did, it did in itself.  Somewhere along the line
we picked up an external agent for managing bad buffers, bdflush. 
Nothing was thought of it.
In recent incantations we've got what are called 'kernel threads'  --
Really what they amount to are a little piece of the micro-kernel world
sneaking into the macro-kernel of Linux.
I'm not saying this is bad, just interesting.  The point I'm making is
that if things are working towards clustered computing, Micro-kernels
have a distinct advantage in this arena.  The MACH 4 micro-kernel (of
which I have not been keeping tabs) would be better modified into a
fully-cluster-aware-and-capable system than taking the existing Linux
base.
Last I knew MACH was a semi-stable micro-k...  That was a year or so
ago.
Just an interesting thought blurb...  Are we heading towards a
micro-kernel?
Linus, Alan, Anyone?
