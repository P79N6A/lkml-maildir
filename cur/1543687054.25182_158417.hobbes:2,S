If there is _no_ unique way to identify the device, that that is
impossible.

We already have that today, it's called /dev/mice :)
Seriously, I support topology positions, that solves this problem for
real.

I don't think I really understand the question.  Given a specific
question, I think I could.

Um, you can, see the topology stuff.

Yup, that works too.

Use that position as a topology/name indicator.

Again, use the topology position.
Please, go read the paper and look at sysfs before asking anything
else...
