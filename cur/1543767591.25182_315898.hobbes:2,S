Anyone have this board? I'm about to try 2.6.12-rc3 on
it to see if DMA works (if not there is fix on
kerneltrap), if the onboard NIC works, If the onboard
SATA controller is detected or not.
It's a very new board and I'm experiencing serious
failures (3 different kernel panics from a RHEL4
kernel alone). 
I'm curious to know if anyone else has had problems
with this board.
Thanks, 
Shawn.
