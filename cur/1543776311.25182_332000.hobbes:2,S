August is fine; it's our sloppiness that the remove announcement did not 
go in earlier. People who run external projects that use such symbols 
might have had forewarning by the previous discussion rounds on 
linux1394-devel.

Now that we are at it, the following EXPORT_SYMBOLs should be removed too...
	_csr1212_read_keyval
	_csr1212_destroy_keyval

...at the same place and for the same reason.
