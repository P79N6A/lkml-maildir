Seems to be, how recent do you want? I am using it, anyways....

-ac is much better than -linus for me.
I am using 2.4.9-ac18. It is mostly good, the occasion swapping when I
leave mozilla or xemacs alone for a little while, but mostly good. Much
better than ever since 2.4.~5 though!
Used 2.4.10-ac1 for a while, but seems worse than 2.4.9-ac1[678].
Looking at the changelog and comments on the list and /. though - very
very promising with 2.4.10-ac11 with the new VM changes. I will compile
that one tonight and try it out when I next reboot (finally having a
decent kernel has given me some uptime I don't want to destroy though ;)

2.4.9-ac* should be good for such a box - looks like you don't put much
demand on it (although the RAM is a little small....)
