MSI seems to have problems with the quality of the engineering of there
motherboards.
I've been fighting all year with a MSI K9 Neo and MSI K9 Diamond
motherboard, buy the same chip set from a different vendor and
everything just works.
I'm unfortunately not experienced enough with this and searching for
someone with a clue has been unsuccessful. It seems that disabling
MSI/MSI-X makes the MSI K9 Diamond stable, the Neo one I just gave up on
and moved to a different brand, but same chip set.
