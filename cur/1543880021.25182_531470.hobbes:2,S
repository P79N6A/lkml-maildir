This may be a good one to ask Ingo about, as he did significant
performance work on per-core runqueues for SMT. While I did write
per-node runqueue code for NUMA at some point in the past, I did no
tuning or other performance work on it, only functionality.
I've actually dealt with kernels using elder versions of Ingo's code
for per-core runqueues on SMT, but was never called upon to examine
that particular code for either performance or stability, so I'm
largely ignorant of what the perceived outcome of it was.
