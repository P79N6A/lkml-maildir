 Okay, I understand your terminology.  Yes, I can not point to any
 particular piece of memory and say "I want *that* one" and have that
 request succeed.  However, I can say "find me 50 chunks of memory
 of your choosing" and have a very good chance of finding enough
 memory to satisfy my request.

 Yeah - and that isn't what is being proposed here.  The goal is to ask
 the kernel to identify some memory which can be legitimately freed and
 hasten the freeing of that memory.
