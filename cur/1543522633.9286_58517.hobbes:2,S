The current version (0.2) does not support ioctl against the nbdd exported
device, from the nbd client. Implementing it would, however be straight
forward.
I see your point if we particularly if we consider using "layered" block
drivers (raid,lvm..),
but for "ordinary block devices", block size, and these kind of parameters
for the exported devices on the nbdd sever, are not really relevant to the
nbd client.
I'll look into it.
