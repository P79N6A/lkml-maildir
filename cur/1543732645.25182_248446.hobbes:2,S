I find myself a bit unsettled at the notion of not really being
able to blame this behavior on BIOS bugs.  What's the world
coming to any more?!

That sounds like it could explain lots of the init/irq problems we've
had on various systems.  Makes me a lot more interested in seeing

For backwards compatibility, the early reset should not be the
default.  There aren't many systems where it's a problem.
