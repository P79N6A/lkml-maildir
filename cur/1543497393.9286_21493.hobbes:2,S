Damn!!!  In general, there seems to be A LOT of FUD flying around about
SGI releasing XFS under an open source license.  I just *don't* understand
why people are being so negative about it.  He we are, essentially being
given a gift from SGI, and everybody's bitching about it.  It seems pretty
clear from what I've read that SGI *really* does intend to release this
beast in source form once they verify that it's clear of the legal crap.
Any way you add this up, it's a good thing.
I, for one, am very grateful for this.  We, The Linux Community (tm)
should be thankful.  We can argue the technical merit of XFS (I've never
used it to any significant extent or seen the source, so I can't commont
on that level).  For all I know it may be a piece of sh*t, but I sincerely
doubt it.  SGI *isn't* known for producing that type of product (unless,
of course, you count running some-other-company-from-Redmond's "O/S").
I'd like to personally say "Thanks, SGI!".  Hopefully, others will join
the chorus.  Unless we want to scare off good-will efforts, we'd better
start treating these people a bit better.
There.  I'll climb down off my soapbox, now.  Seriously, though, let's
say "thanks" for the effort.
