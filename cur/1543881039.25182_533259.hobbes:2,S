Anyway, my X was mostly unused (below 1% CPU), which was my intent when
replacing glxgears by ocbench. We have not settled yet about how to handle
the special case for X. Let's at least try to get the best schedulers without
this problem, then see how to make them behave the best taking X into account.

Con, I think it could be a good idea since you recommend to renice X with
SD. Most of the problem users are facing with renicing X is that they need
to change their configs or scripts. If the kernel can reliably detect X and
handle it differently, why not do it ?
It makes me think that this hint might be used to set some flags in the task
struct in order to apply different processing than just renicing. It is indeed
possible that nice is not the best solution and that something else would be
even better (eg: longer timeslices, but not changing priority in the queues).
Just an idea anyway.
OK, back to work ;-)
