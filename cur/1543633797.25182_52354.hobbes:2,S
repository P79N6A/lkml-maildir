   That means that all buffers must be allocated seperately.
   Is it worth that ? How about skbuffs ?
skbuffs are fine, they are already minimally aligned to
SMP_CACHE_BYTES and also have the same minimum length.
The only problematic case are as in the eepro100.c driver where it
tries to use part of the skbuff data area for the receive descriptor.
