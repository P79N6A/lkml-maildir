I saw that ext3 is going into 2.4.15 by the testing/ChangeLog.  There are
also lots of Alan Cox merging, but no specific mention of whether or not
the 32-bit UID quota patch has gone in, or is going in.
The ext3 and 32-bit UID quotas were the only two patches I was really
relying on the -ac releases for.
