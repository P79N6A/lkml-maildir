Subject: [PATCH] SLAB - have index_of bug at compile time.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,  after all the talk over SLAB and SLOBs I decided to make myself
useful, and I'm trying very hard to understand the Linux implementation
of SLAB.  So I'm going through ever line of code and examining it
thoroughly, when I find something that could be improved, either
performance wise (highly doubtful), clean up wise, documentation wise,
enhancement wise, or just have a question, I'll make myself known.
This email is enhancement wise. ;)
I noticed the code for index_of is a creative way of finding the cache
index using the compiler to optimize to a single hard coded number.  But
I couldn't help noticing that it uses two methods to let you know that
someone used it wrong.  One is at compile time (the correct way), and
the other is at run time (not good).
OK, this isn't really an enhancement since the code already works. But
this change can help those later who do real enhancements to SLAB.
