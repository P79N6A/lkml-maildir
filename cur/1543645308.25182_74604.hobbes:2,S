I can only talk for myself, 2.5 works fine here on my boxes. Dunno what
you mean about audio layer, emu10k works for me.
SCSI drivers can be a real problem. Not the porting of them, most of
that is _trivial_ and can be done as we enter 3.0-pre and people show up
running that on hardware that actually needs to be ported. The worst bit
is error handling, this I view as the only problem.
Update of drivers to 2.4 level is mainly a matter of Dave (or someone
else) resyncing his -dj tree and feeding it back to Linus.

Well why don't they run with 2.5?
Alan, I think you are a pessimist painting a much bleaker picture of 2.5
than it deserves. Sure lots of drivers may be broken still, I would be
naive if I thought that this is all changed in time for oct 31. Most of
these will not be fixed until people actually _use_ 2.5 (or 3.0-pre, or
whatever it will be called), and that will not happen until Linus
actually releases a -rc or similar. And so the fsck what? Noone expects
2.6-pre/3.0-pre to be perfect.
I'm not worried.
