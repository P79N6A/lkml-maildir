Well, in my case at least, because if a network-listening daemon fell
over with sigsegv, sigill, etc I most definitely wanted to know about
it.  But, you certainly could make a patch to do only that; it'd be
lower impact, less contraversial but probably still not accepted into
mainline (just a guess).

Hm, I see Thar Filipau bringing that up specifically, and it does seem
like something that ought to generate some logs.  (But I thought they
should already generate oops's?  Apparently not.)  The OP seemed to be
concerned with any SIGSEGV and SIGILL signals, not just in-kernel ones?
