Have you looked at the wait_event() family yet?       Adapting that 
methodolgy might
suit your needs.
I don't know much about preemption yet, however I suspect it would be a 
bug to allow
preemption while the spinlock was held.  In other words, you might need 
to do something like
disable preemption
spinlock
rc = condition
spin_unlock
enable preemption
if (rc)
...
In other words, perform the test on the condition outside of the 
critical region protected by the spin lock.
