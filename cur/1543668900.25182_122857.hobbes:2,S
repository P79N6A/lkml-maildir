very interesting article.

Since we need commutative source/dest addresses in many places, the use of a
XOR is a common practice. In fact, while working on hash tables a while ago, I
found that I could get very good results with something such as :
   RND1 = random_generated_at_start_time() ;
   RND2 = random_generated_at_start_time() ;
   /* RND2 may be 0 or equal to RND1, all cases seem OK */
   x = (RND1 - saddr) ^ (RND1 - daddr) ^ (RND2 + saddr + daddr);
   reduce(x) ...
With this method, I found no way to guess a predictable (saddr, daddr) couple
which gives a same result, and saddr/daddr are still commutative. It resists
common cases where saddr=daddr, saddr=~daddr, saddr=-daddr. And *I think* tha
the random makes other cases difficult to predict. I'm not specialized in
crypto or whatever, so I cannot tell how to generate the best RND1/2, and it's
obvious to me that stupid values like 0 or -1 may not help a lot, but this is
still better than a trivial saddr ^ daddr, at a very low cost.
For example, the x86 encoding of the simple XOR hash would result in :
  mov saddr, %eax
  xor daddr, %eax
 => 2 cycles with result in %eax
The new calculation will look like :
  mov saddr, %ebx
  mov daddr, %ecx
  lea (%ebx,%ecx,1), %eax
  neg %ecx
  add RND2, %eax		// can be omitted if zero
  add RND1, %ecx
  neg %ebx
  xor %ecx, %eax
  add RND1, %ebx
  xor %ebx, %eax
  
=> 5 cycles on dual-pipelines CPUs, result in eax, but uses 2 more regs.
Any comments ?
Regards,
Willy
