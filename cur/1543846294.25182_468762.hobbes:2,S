no options at all, so there may be room for improvement. Also, on my
notebook, I have hardlinked all my linux directories so that each
content only appears once. I don't have the numbers right here, but
I remember that it was really useful to merge lots of different versions,
but that the net gain within one given tree was really minor, as there
are not that many identical files in one tree.
