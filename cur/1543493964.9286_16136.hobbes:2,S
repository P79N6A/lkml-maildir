I'd like to announce another step in the right direction, namely
PPSkit-0.6.1 for Linux.  According to some graphs I've seen, the
implementation is not one order of magnitude worse than the
well-blessed FreeBSD version. And there's still room for major
improvements.
As a general note: I'm missing feedback for non-i386 architectures!
(FEEDBACK WELCOME!)
OK, here are the facts (NEWS):
                            NEWS for 0.6.1
+ Merged into Linux 2.2.6, basically without conflict (read: should
  still work with 2.2.5).  Increased speed of adjtime from 0.5ms/s to
  50ms/s.
+ Avoid potential negative spikes in time (architecture independent).
  Rewrote algorithm for ``do_clock_getres()'' (for fun).
+ Fixed minor problem with uninitialized data in ``enable_pps.c''.
+ Added enhanced nanokernel support for ntp-4.0.92g (ntpdc, ntptime,
  tickadj).
+ Added a reminder that applications must be recompiled for some
  features of ``adjtimex()''.
+ Fixed a potential instability in ``hardpps()'', related to the FLL
  when pulses arrive doubled.  ``STA_PPSSIGNAL'' is set with greater
  care now.
+ Several minor fixes: ``time_adjust'' is a private variable now.
  NTP's precision adjustments (actually ``STA_PPSTIME'' and
  ``MOD_OFFSET'') will cancel any remaining correction left from a
  preceding adjtime() call.  This is specifically important because of
  the slow adjustment in Linux (0.05%).
+ Removed unnecessary code in ``arch/sparc/kernel/pcic.c''.
+ Fixed compilation for i386 architecture where ``CONFIG_X86_TSC'' is
  not defined.  The variable is referenced also in ``smp.c'', so it's
  always there now, even if the value is zero.
And again, here's the LSM:
