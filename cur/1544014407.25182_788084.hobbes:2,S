Except it doesn't have to tick twice.  Refer to
http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/7/78
 in which I show that a time_t (what
time() returns) counts leap seconds (According to Bernstein this is what
UTC means), and using zoneinfo, the library processes leap seconds
correctly.
I just realised that the Notes in man 2 time are confusing and probably
unnecessary.  Suffice to say that (assuming correctly configured
zoneinfo) time() returns the number of seconds elapsed since start 1970.
