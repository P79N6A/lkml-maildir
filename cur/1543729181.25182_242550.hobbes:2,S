I'm sitting on the vendor's driver for these cards.  How does your work
differ from this?
hch questioned why we need the driver at all: just put the card in JBOD
mode and use s/w raid drivers.  But the thing does have an on-board CPU and
the idea is that by offloading to that, the data transits the bus just a
single time.  The developers are off doing some comparative benchmarking at
present.
