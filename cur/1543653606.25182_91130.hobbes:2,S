Care to implement a generic ringbuffer in a header file, to avoid
this kind of errors? I'm sure there are more (and even overflows
on some implementations).
The gory implementation details of basic computer science
algorithms seem to cause problems for many driver writers.
So the trend of abstracting these away in the kernel, if it costs
no time and doesn't lead to ugly code, is right.
