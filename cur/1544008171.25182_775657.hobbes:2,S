Oh, btw, one more thing: since it apparently sometimes _does_ resume 
from hibernation without all this, I'd also like to see the actual 
differences in /proc/ioports and /proc/iomem that happen as a result of 
the different alignment. 
I also really suspect we should add a whole "alignment" field to "struct 
resource", instead of the size-vs-start flags. The fact is, some PCI 
devices have alignment that is neither tied to size or anything else: I 
think some PCI bus resources are really always 4kB-aligned, for example 
(and aligning them by size will give a bigger alignment than actually 
required).
