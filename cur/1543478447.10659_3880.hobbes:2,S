hello,
	most people seem happy with this release. I
got lots of comments picking up small things, and the
format seemed to keep most people happy. I got a few
people saying I shouldn't do this at all, and an equal 
number saying they could use what's being presented
here.  I don't think there's too much point going further
so I'll do one more version after this, and then I'll
relinquish the bandwidth for more useful things, i.e.
I want to go look into how hard it is to write a driver
for the SBlive. so send me comments again, and then
I'll finish this thread up. 
cheers
Greg Smart
**** DRAFT **** PRESS RELEASE - LINUX KERNEL 2.2.0 **** DRAFT ****
LINUX KERNEL 2.2
Santa Clara CA, January XX, 1999
Today the Linux software development team, led by Linus Torvalds release a 
major new of the the Linux operating system. This update brings advanced 
scalability, broad support for newer hardware, and a large collection of 
low-level features.
Highlights include:
* Advanced network routing and WAN support, which gives Linux the
  ability to replace many expensive proprietary network devices.
  Users can take control of their intranet with priority traffic,
  usage limits, accounting, and virtual private networks. Strong
  128-bit encryption is available as an add-on component.
* Y2K compliance.
* Enterprise-level network filesystem support, complete with data
  replication for performance, mobility, and reliability.
* Video capture support, TV tuner support, simplified audio support,
  and other multimedia enhancements.
* Support for a large variety of parallel port devices including
  disk drives, tape drives, and other easy-to-use external devices.
* Greater performance, especially while under heavy load or while
  running on computers with multiple processors.
* Compatibility support for reading BSD and NT filesystems. Easy 
  access to documents stored on NTFS-format disks will facilitate 
  the upgrade from legacy NT systems to Linux.
Advanced technical users are already using this update, available
from the Internet. Linux vendors will begin shipping fully integrated 
systems using the new kernel in March.  Business users will be 
able to obtain the update on CD-ROM distributions.
Linux is a secure network operating system for demanding users.
It interoperates well with a wide variety of other systems.
Linux can take advantage of modern PC and PowerMac hardware 
or give new life to older 486-based computers. Several other 
processors, including the 64-bit Alpha and Sparc 64 are also 
supported. Support is widely available via both traditional contracts 
and cost-effective Internet groups. Linux is provided under an 
unlimited-use license that lets users make in-house customizations 
to the system itself. Initial estimates suggest that Linux had 10 
to 20 million users at the end of 1998.
Linus Torvalds, originally from Finland, lives with his family in Santa
Clara CA, USA. He and others created Linux as an alternative to
commercial operating systems after becoming disillusioned with the
poor quality of commercial alternatives.
