This is my current code it adds a vga entry to all VGA devices in the system.

Instead of toggle there are four states:
1) off
2) on - make sure everything else is off
3) turn off all VGA devices and remember the active one
4) restore the active one
States 3 and 4 and used for running the reset program. Set state 3 to
remember the active device and turn it off, reset the card which will
enable it's VGA, disable it, set state 4 to restore the saved device.
This thread is active too:
Reliable video POSTing on resume
Restart video after resume is the same problem as posting it in the first place.
