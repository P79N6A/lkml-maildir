Sure, that's possible. It happens occasionally with updated user-land 
binaries, especially system-related ones (eg something like X or SElinux 
or whatever).
Or perhaps a configuration change meant that if you recompiled the "good" 
kernel, you now recompiled a different config? Or did you re-use the exact 
same kernel image you had originally?

Ok, that's a much bigger bisection thing, but again, even just narrowing 
it down a bit will help. But check the configuration too before you start.
