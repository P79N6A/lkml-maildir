Right.  That's a great design feature.

As far as I am concerned syslets by themselves are a dead letter,
because you can't do any of the things that potential application
coders need to do with them.  As for threadlets, making them kernel
threads is not such a good design feature, O(1) scheduler or not.  You
take the full hit of kernel task creation, on the spot, for every
threadlet that blocks.  You don't fence off the threadlet from any of
the stuff that it ought to be fenced off from for thread-safety
reasons, so you don't have much choice but to create a new TLS arena
for it (which you need anyway for errno), so they have horrible MMU
and memory overhead.  You can't dispatch them inexpensively, while the
data delivered by a softirq is still hot in cache, to traverse 1-3
lines of userspace code and make the next syscall.  So they're just
not usable for any of the things that a real AIO application actually
does.

You're telling me that scheduling parallel I/O is the kernel's job but
throttling it is userspace's job?

You won't be able to do it later if you don't design for it now.
Don't reinvent the square wheel -- there's a model to follow that was
so successful that it has killed all alternate models in its sphere.
Namely, IEEE 754.  But please try not to make pipeline flushes suck as
much as they did on the i860.
Cheers,
