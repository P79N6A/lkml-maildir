Hello Anton/Tabi
I am not sure which is the best place to configure the pins. Because
some drivers do it in one way and some in the other.
I actually tried to make the driver similar to ucc_geth because it is a
QE driver. The driver has no platform code in the platform files similar
to ucc_geth. It is probed along with all the QE devices thorugh
of_platform_bus_probe.
And the pins are configured for all the QE devices using  par_io_init.
I thought this to be the most consistent way at that time.
How should we close this point?
Can we go ahead with the pio-map?
Infact the discussion in this thread was very good and I got to know a
lot of rationales behind this.
Please suggest.
Thanks and Regards
Poonam

If hardware configuration is selected at the bootup time, by jumpers or
switches, it's even easier to do it right. Without pio-map.

Why you need to modify the device tree for that? Let the U-Boot simply
setup pins for the kernel. Regarding kernel overwriting pins
configuration...

What I've understood from the previous debates, is that ideally kernel
should not touch pins' configuration. Today we're using pio-map solely
to fix up some old firmware misconfiguration. And we can do this in the
board file still. To determine if we need to fixup the firmware or not,
we can use some device tree property instead (firmware version?).
p.s.
I'm neither for pio-map nor against. I just want some consequence
regarding this. Last thread ended with consequence that pio-map is a bad
thing to use...
