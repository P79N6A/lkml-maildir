I tried to patch a 2.2.13 with reiserfs and ext3, apart from the crucial
Makefile rejects, I get symbol collisions for these symbols:
buffer_journaled() <- a lot
journal_release()  <- a couple (2) 
It compiled, but reiserfs ooopsed then. Not sure if there are further
duplicate symbols that went unnoticed. 
I'm using ext3-0.0.2c on a plain-2.2.13+reiserfs, with the kdb-patches
that come with ext3 applied. reiserfs is the beta with journaling
support.
