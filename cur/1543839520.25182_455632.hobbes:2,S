Hello List
On Linux 2.6 (exact 2.6.15) issuing a wget at this location 
http://www.wohin-heute.at/highlights.php
 results in a truncated file. 
Truncated before "</hmtl>.
First we suspected our firewall, but this proofed not be unguilty it seems.
I now tried that address on a lot machines on a lot of locations, but as 
it turns it will work everywhere except on Linux 2.6 machines.
The URI will wget fine on:
OpenBsd 3.9
AIX 3
Windows XP
Linux 2.4.10
Since thats not a really important site, this is an academic question 
after all :)
Has someone an idea, what may cause this network problem which seems to 
be limited to linux 2.6?
Greetings,
Axel Kittenberger
