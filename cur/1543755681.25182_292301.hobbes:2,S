Indeed. As I put it in the howto, the SVN repository is about 900 MB
(but I think it can be less when using svn's fsfs storage backend,
I must test this...), plus 600 MB per working copy.
There is not much anybody can do about this.

With the 'full' svn solution you lose some storage space but you
gain in time. The above steps are automatic and you don't have to
bother looking at the changes, decide if it matters or not, etc.

I think you end up with pretty much the same network traffic in both
cases (svn or linux.tar.gz + bk patches). The only difference is the
storage cost.
