I meant: measured for IO workloads.
I had one group tell me their IO efficiency went up by several
*times* on a 16-way NUMA system after generalising the wake
balancing to interrupts as well.

That would make the behaviour change even more violent, which is
what I dislike. I would much prefer to have code that handles both
workloads without introducing sudden cutoff points in behaviour.

Passive balancing cuts in only when an imbalance is becoming apparent.
If the queue gets more imbalanced, periodic balancing will cut in,
and that is much worse than wake balancing.

Yep, I agree the wake balancing code in 2.6.12 wasn't ideal. That's
why I changed it in 2.6.13 - precisely because it moved things around
too much. It probably still isn't ideal though.

Well, I wouldn't say it is always the best method. Especially not when
there is a big variation in the CPU consumption of the groups of tasks.
But anyway, even in the cases where it definitely is the best method,
we really should try to handle them properly without binding too.
I do agree that more measurements are needed :)
