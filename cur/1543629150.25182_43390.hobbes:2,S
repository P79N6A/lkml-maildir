Interesting point.  Fortunately, the logical_to_phys table doesn't have to
be a hash, making it considerably smaller.  Then we get to the interesting
part: allocating the phys_to_logical hash table.
The boot loader must have provided at least some contiguous physical
memory in order to load the kernel, the compressed disk image and give
us a little working memory.  (For practical purposes, we're most likely to
have been provided with a full gig, or whatever is appropriate according
to the mem= command line setting, but lets pretend it's a lot less than
that.)  Now, the first thing we need to do is fill in enough of the
vsection table to allocate the table itself.  Fortunately, the bottom part
of the table is the part we need to fill in, and we surely have enough
memory to do that.  We just have to be sure that the process of filling
it in doesn't require any bootmem allocations, which is not so hard - we
the existing memory initialization code already has to obey that
requirement.
Naturally, during initialization of the hash table, we want to be sure
not to perform and phys_to_logical translations, as would be required to 
read values from the page tables during swap-out for example.  Probably
there's already no possibility of that, but it needs a comment at least.
I can't provide any more details than that, because I'm not familiar
with the way the iseries boots.  Anton is the man there.

We ought to have some clue about the maximum number of physical memory
chunks available to us.  I doubt *every* partition is going to be
provided 256 GB of memory.  In fact, the real amount we need will be
considerably less, and the phys_to_logical table will be smaller than
16 MB, say, 1 MB.  Just allocate the whole thing and be done with it.

For this one I'd think a classic, nonlist, hash table is the way to go.
At 16 bytes, I overestimated the per-entry size, really 8 bytes is more
realistic.  We need 34 bits for the key field (52 bit physical range,
less 18 bits chunk size) and considerably less than 32 bits for the
value field (a logical section) so it works out nicely.

I think that the bootstrapping method described above is sufficiently
simple and robust to obviate this requirement.

The most obvious and practical approach is to have the boot loader tell
us, we allocate the maximum size needed, and won't worry about that
again.
