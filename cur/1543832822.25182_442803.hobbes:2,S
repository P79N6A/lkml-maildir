Slightly OT, I just read this message from all th thread.
A quick question (you can answer me in private if this is not suitable for
this list).
How can I clone the output from one card to other ? I want to say something
like 'all PCM that goes to this emu10k1, copy it to this other card'.
Basically, I want to play music on two cards at the same time.
TIA
