Calls are still in atomic context until we change the i_mmap_lock to a
mutex under a CONFIG_XPMEM, or unless we boost mm_users, drop the lock
and restart the loop at every different mm. In any case those changes
should be under CONFIG_XPMEM IMHO given desktop users definitely don't
need this (regular non-blocking mmu notifiers in my patch are all what
a desktop user need as far as I can tell).

GRU will perform the same with #v7 or V8.
