Interesting: The X/Open spec. says that the three return codes for
NLM_CANCEL are _GRANTED (success), _DENIED (failure), and
_DENIED_GRACE_PERIOD (call back later).
_DENIED_NOLOCKS is not listed as one of the possible (i.e. valid) return
codes, which makes sense when you think about it: cancels shouldn't fail
due to locking resources having been exhausted.
Does anyone know if this was an accidental deviation, or was it done for
some deliberate reason?  Olaf?  H.J.?
BCMK> 	So NLM_LCK_BLOCKED and NLM_LCK_DENIED are not being handled.  (And
BCMK> I'm getting NLM_LCK_DENIED errors.)  I checked the RFCs and it looks like

BCMK>   case NLM_LCK_GRANTED:
BCMK>   case NLM_LCK_DENIED_GRACE_PERIOD:
BCMK>          /* Everything's good */

BCMK>   case NLM_LCK_DENIED_NOLOCKS:
BCMK>         dprintk("lockd: CANCEL failed (server has no locks)\n");
BCMK>         goto retry_cancel;  
Arguably, that last case should be removed and picked up by the default:
printk notice (as an anomaly).
BCMK> +  case NLM_LCK_DENIED:
BCMK> +	dprintk("lockd: CANCEL failed (general error)\n");
BCMK> +	goto retry_cancel;
And that should replace it.
--Up, inviting correction if he's misunderstanding something.
