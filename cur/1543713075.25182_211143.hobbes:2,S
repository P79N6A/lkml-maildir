Some form of control over changing the sysctl settings (beyond just the
mode) should be provided; otherwise, the module is too unsafe by itself
for real use, and you can't assume that people will only use it stacked
with SELinux (which could control such changes).  Allowing the settings
to be locked as mcp suggested sounds simple and sufficient for the
proposed use; they can disable their desired capability and then lock in
/sbin/init.  For greater generality, I'd suggest adding a new capability
to control the ability to set the capability sysctls, but then we are in
a vicious cycle...
