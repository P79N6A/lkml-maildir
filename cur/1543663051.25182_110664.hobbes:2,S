In this case it definitely wants something identity mapped, which would
mean in the first 2TB region.  On x86 the limit is 4GB because I only have
32bit pointers.  On a 64bit arch that limit should go away.

That makes sense.    I guess it boils down to the fact that init_mm
is special cased in a number of places and using it I am likely to get
me into trouble...
You would not happen to have code that creates a separate mm so I can
be lazy would you?
