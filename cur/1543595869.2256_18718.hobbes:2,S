Hello Alan,
you've missed the CONFIG_DRM_AGP thing.
Some other config objects (Input -> joysticks , SMB file system) are
broken, too.
Regards,
	Dieter

    invoked from within
".f0.right.save invoke"
    ("uplevel" body line 1)
    invoked from within
"uplevel #0 [list $w invoke]"
    (procedure "tkButtonUp" line 7)
