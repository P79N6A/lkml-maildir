Because the inode could be on inode_unused, being still on the hash at
the client side, and server could reuse the inode (in case of
unfsd/ext3).  When the inode will be reused for different type, it
will result error.  Here is a scenario for non-patched 2.4.18:
   (1) Symbolic link has been removed.  The inode is put on inode_unused.
       Say the inode # was 0x1234.
   (2) Client issue "creat", server returns inode # 0x1234 (by the reuse).
   (3) Call chain is:
	 nfs_create -> nfs_instantiate -> nfs_fhget -> __nfs_fhget -> iget4
       iget4 returns the cached inode object on inode_unused.
   (4) nfs_fill_inode doesn't fill it, because inode->i_mode is not 0.
   (5) nfs_refresh_inode result error because inode->i_mode != fattr->mode.
Note that this is _real_ case.

Well, I've just tested this.  This works well, thank you.
