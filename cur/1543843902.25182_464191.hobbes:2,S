i'm giving up on Karim too. I did apologize to Karim for the mistake i 
did in this thread-of-200-mails, but it's revolting to see that Karim 
still goes on and attacks top Linux contributors like you, without 
looking back, without apologizing for anything and without feeling any 
remorse. Karim patronized, attacked and insulted various people dozens 
of times in this thread alone. I just dont see any value in trying to 
"work with" Karim anymore, because it's apparently not something he is 
interested in doing. I feel a bit sorry for him too, because at heart he 
must be a deeply lonely person.
( I do see value in working with Mathieu, who has shown lot of insight, 
  patience, ability in cleaning up the LTT codebase and producing LTTng. 
  I dont envy him for having to work with Karim though. LTTng still 
  needs alot of work to be upstream-acceptable but my current impression 
  is that Mathieu's fundamentally professional approach will be 
  successful. )

you dont need to justify your experience to Karim. Your countless 
contributions to the Linux kernel speak for themselves. Most tellingly, 
his boasting aside, the only embedded-related Linux kernel contribution 
i have ever seen from Karim was the 1000-lines relayfs code - and even 
that code took years for Tom Zanussi to clean up and to get upstream. 
Besides that i have not seen a single line of code from Karim - not a 
single patch, not a oneliner fix, nothing. So if someone needs to prove 
his experience in embedded Linux matters on this forum then it's Karim.
