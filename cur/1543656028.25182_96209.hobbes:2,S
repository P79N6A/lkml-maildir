Possibly not bugzilla worthy - it's /sbin/modprobe that's ENOENT, not the
scsi adapter module itself.
This message is generated when the initrd loads scsi_mod.o and then
sd_mod.o without loading any hostadapters first.  init_sd does a
scsi_register_module(MODULE_SCSI_DEV, &sd_template) which causes a
request_module("scsi_hostadapter") in scsi_mod.o as the initrd hasn't yet
loaded any hostadapters.  The initrd then proceeds to load some the
hostadapter drivers explicitly via insmod and everything proceeds fine.
Presumably if mkinitrd was reordered to load scsi_mod, first hostadapter,
then sd_mod, etc, the message would go away but as it stands it is purely
cosmetic.
