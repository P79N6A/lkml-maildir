Subject: [PATCH 0/6] Swap over NFS

Hi,
These patches implement swap files on NFS, but lay the foundation to
allow swap files on any non block device backed file.
As is, these patches allow for swapfiles to me used on NFS mounts. However
some extra work is needed to make this safe. It is not very hard to deadlock
a kernel with only these patches.
In the next VM deadlock avoidance series I will include a patch to remedy
this.
