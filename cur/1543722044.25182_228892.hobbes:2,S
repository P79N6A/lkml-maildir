Huh?  Explain to me how else you would do builds that have separate
output directory?  And what is the difference from above to:
make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build O=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/object M=`pwd`
except that you will _not_ cause existing stuff to break?

How is that?  In both cases the 'build' symlink do not point to the
source anymore.
