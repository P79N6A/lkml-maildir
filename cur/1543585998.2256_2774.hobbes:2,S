Given the amount, trafic on this mailing list and other places that this 
topic has created. Most of what I propose is not new it was proposed by 
others on this list.  Prong 1 is pretty much what oom_kill does with some 
slight canges and an addition of putting nice tasks too sleep, prong 2 is a 
variation of providing resources too root user, along with some resource 
accounting information that can be used both in the kernel and userland. If 
we don't get the right task, the problem continues too progress,. untill the 
right task is found or the system is brought too it knees.  Prong three 
provides a way too communicate with userland providing what aix does, and 
provides some level of being proactive instead of just be reactive where we 
have unto now been doing the wrong thing according too other readers of this 
list.
