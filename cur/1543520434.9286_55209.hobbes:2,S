Subject: IDE signed/unsigned problem in /proc (2.2 Kernel)

It looks like there is a problem in 2.2.12-20  (RedHat 6.1)
in signed/unsigned conversion for IDE disk geometry.
On a computer with 4Gb IDE the
cat /proc/ide/hda/geometry
gives
physical     8930/15/63
logical      525/255/63
which are correct values.
In the same time on a computer with 27 Gb IDE I have:
cat /proc/ide/hda/geometry
physical     -12781/16/63
logical      -12781/16/63
It prints negative values which are obviously incorrect.
I expect some kind of signed/unsigned conversion problem.
The hdparm print correct values in both cases:
For 4Gb IDE:
 /sbin/hdparm  /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 multcount    =  0 (off)
 I/O support  =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 525/255/63, sectors = 8439184, start = 0
For 27 Gb IDE
/sbin/hdparm /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 multcount    =  0 (off)
 I/O support  =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 52755/16/63, sectors = 53177040, start = 0
