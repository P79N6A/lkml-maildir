This is a Toshiba Satellite 1800, with said sound card, running RH 8.0 +
updates. When starting xmms the system (semi-)hangs: It seems to work for a
fraction of a second and stops for seconds at a time. No shift-lock, mouse,
nothing. Only way out was to turn it off (perhaps with more patience I
could've got in to reboot cleanly, but...). /var/logg/messages ends with:

The "try clear busy flag" repeats ad nauseam before too.
Obviously no sound at all.
Hadn't this been fixed in -ac?
