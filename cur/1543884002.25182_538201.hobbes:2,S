That's the *only* difference?  You don't have different major/minor pairs that
correspond to different PCI IDs, or something?  I'm confused as to what you're
trying to achieve here - if the problem is that /dev/mydev0 through /dev/mydev3
have different major/minors on different systems, there's probably eaiser ways
to fix that in userspace...
