Well, in 2.2.0-testing-pre7, I have this prob.
The tulip driver will only work with my cards(macronix) for 4 secs.  I start a
ping from a remote machine, get no response, ifconfig eth0 up, get 4 pings,
then the card goes down.  A simple ifconfig down/up cycle lets it work again,
but it still errors out.  Even without any traffic, the card will still
disable itself.
This tulip driver:
static const char version[] = "tulip.c:v0.90 10/20/98
becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov\n";
works fine.  All I do is drop the file in.
