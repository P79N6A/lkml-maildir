to be able to have a chance to fix it we need you meet the minimum 
threshold for bugreports: please send the failing .config and a full 
boot message of the incident as well. (Please also check latest x86.git, 
maybe it's something that got fixed today.)
I have tested latest x86.git#mm on 3 different 64bit machines and Thomas 
tested it too, and none of us saw any crashes. So whatever you are 
seeing, it's unfortunately not very common to trigger.
