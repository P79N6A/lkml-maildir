Sorry for following up on my own post, I have a little extra
information.
I started a g++ job to try to force the machine to write out some dirty
buffers before I reboot.   g++ now hangs along with two sync's, bdflush
and the postgres process.
This is from top:
  PID USER     PRI  NI  SIZE  RSS SHARE WCHAN     STAT %CPU %MEM   TIME COMMAN
    6 root       9   0     0    0     0 raid1_all DW    0.0  0.0   0:26 bdflush
 1140 joe        9   0 71564  39M     0 wait_on_b D     0.0 32.3   1:04 cc1plus
 1007 root       9   0    72    4     4 wait_on_b D     0.0  0.0   0:00 sync
10023 postgres   9   0   368    4     4 wait_on_b D     0.0  0.0   0:00 postmas
Seems like something's rotten with bdflush and raid1_all (-something).
There is one (software) RAID1 on four SCSI disks in the machine, perhaps RAID1
has a misfeature when more than just two disks are in the mirror ?
Anyway, this machine is going down now - I can't wait anymore, sorry. I wonder
how many file writes didn't make it...
