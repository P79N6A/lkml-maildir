There are three files that have to be changed.
You changed dir.c yesterday, and namei.c today
but still have to do inode.c.
Your stuff resembles my stuff. In namei.c I also replaced the 15
lines following
	} else if (dir->i_sb->u.isofs_sb.s_mapping == 'n') {
by the line
	dlen = isofs_name_translate(dpnt, dlen, page);
But now that you did two-thirds of the job I take it you'll
also do the third part? It is again precisely the same stuff.
