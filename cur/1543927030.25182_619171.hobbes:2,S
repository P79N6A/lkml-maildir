Subject: [PATCH 0/2] sched: group scheduler related patches (V2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Ingo,
        Here's V2 of the two patches related to group cpu scheduling I
sent a while ago:
Patch 1/2 -> Fixes minor bugs and coding style issues
Patch 2/2 -> Improves group fairness on SMP systems.
Changes since V1:
	- Introduced a task_group_mutex to serialize add/removal of
	  task groups (as pointed by Dipankar)
Both the patches should not have any functional/runtime effect to the scheduler
for !CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED case.
This is also probably one of the last big changes related to group scheduler
that I had on my plate. Pls apply if there is no objection from anyone.
