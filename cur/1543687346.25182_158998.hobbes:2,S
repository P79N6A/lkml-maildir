The source address in the ARP request is not irrelevant, because a 
broadcast arp request causes all recipients of that broadcast request to 
update their arp cache entry (if they have a cache entry for that IP) 
for the IP specified in the source with the MAC specified in the request.
So, in an environment where a single address is aliased in multiple 
places, such as tunnel endpoints and loopback aliases, and in 
multi-homed same-segment configs, it is unpredictable asto which IP will 
be bound to which MAC for every machine (or arp cache) on the network.
