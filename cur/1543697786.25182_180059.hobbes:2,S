Good morning:
Just to inform.
- Having constant and immediate freezes with kernel-2.6.0-test9 
regarding ACPI.
- APM is not working ok also. (Cannot power down the laptop).
- Tested all combinations of both them and all kernel options. No luck.
- Freezing happens within 2 to 5 minutes after booting.
- Worked ok on  test 1, 2, 3 and 6. (both ACPI or APM)
I'd love to debug and provide some info, but nothing's there on logs ( 
freezes).
Will try test10. Thanks for attention.
