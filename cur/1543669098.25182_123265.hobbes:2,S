I constructed a -pre7 kernel without sound support to get over the other 
issue, and enabled the Special Feature. The disks were recognised as ide2 
and ide3 and init started ok. Sadly, another issue prevented the machine 
from booting fully, so I am not sure if all is well. I will pursue things 
further shortly.
I don't understand, though, why in 2.4.20 we had 2 modes -- non-Special to 
get IDE-only and Special to get FastTrak RAID support, and now we only have 
one, with the non-Special setting being a no-op and, apparently, Special 
being IDE only.
What is happening?
