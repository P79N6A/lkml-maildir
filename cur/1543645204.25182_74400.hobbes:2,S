Using smp_processor_id() is usually a bug.
Please default to using get_cpu()/put_cpu().
- It pins the caller onto that CPU if the kernel is preemptive.
- You may not sleep inside get_cpu/put_cpu.  
- If you do something which might sleep inside get_cpu/put_cpu,
  you get might_sleep() warnings.
Probably, smp_processor_id() needs to be renamed to something
which is hard to type.
