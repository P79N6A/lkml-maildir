hmmm... tell me about it. and not even neccessarily recent.
i had 2 IBM DDRS and 1 DGHS 9GB SCSI drives fail on me all in the
space of a month. All part of one 3disk raid5 array -> 3/3 failure 
rate. 
wasn't bad power, cause the seagates that were in the same box are
still chugging along now, nearly 2 years later. the seagates and 1
quantum that replaced the 3 failed IBMs are also still chugging
along.
