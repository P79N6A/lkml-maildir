You don't seem to understand the difference between a kernel API and a
user API.  Only code that is part of the kernel can use a kernel API, so
only kernel drivers can use the "URB" interface.  By contrast, a user API
can be used by regular programs, not part of the kernel.  libusb provides
a user API.
So there's really no choice.  Unless you're writing a kernel module, your 
program can't use URBs.  You can use libusb, or if you don't care about 
portability you can use ioctl calls directly.  But you can't use URBs.
