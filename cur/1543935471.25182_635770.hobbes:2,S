Hi all,
the following 5 patches fix 227 errors and 2 warnings
reported by checkpatch.pl
I hope they don't introduce problems in the process and 
that they can be applied.
I know there is no agreement on the list about whether these
patches should be posted/accepted or not so I'm just resending
the mangled patches that already hit the list.
I'll then start working what Andi suggested here:

Ingo, I would appreciated your feedback about the work I'm 
doing, if you want me to stop or continue.
If you want me to work on further fixes I would appreciate
if you could indicate files that needs fixing minimazing
impacts on the overall process.
Thanks.
