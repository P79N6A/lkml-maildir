 the bastion sftp example i gave which required selinux on top of a much
 broader set of POSIX file permissions demonstrates the fallacy of your
 statement.
 try to achieve the same effect with POSIX - even POSIX ACLs
 (uploader only has create and write, not read, not delete;
  downloader has read and delete, not write, not create)
 and you will fail, miserably, because under POSIX, write implies
 create.
