Subject: [x86/mm] vsyscall_fn fault in early startup

I bisected my startup problem down to:

	    x86: mark native_read_tsc() as __vsyscall_fn
	    Andi Kleen reported the following breakage: the 64-bit vdso faulted
	    because native_read_tsc() is not a vsyscall-fn. Mark it as such.

Without that commit, it gets past early startup and boots fine,
but of course then init crashes in the vDSO just as Andi reported.
Apparently this one:

	    x86: map vsyscalls early enough
	    map vsyscalls early enough. This is important if a __vsyscall_fn
	    function is used by other kernel code too.

is not really doing its job.  It's not early enough for the use I'm hitting.
Thanks to qemu-gdbserver, I have this handy backtrace for the early startup
case even though it dies too hard to print one.  
0xffffffffff60010d is really &native_read_tsc+0 though gdb reports the name
of the preceding symbol (vread_tsc).

So with lockdep et al turned on, tick_init leads to native_read_tsc.
setup_arch is after tick_init, so not early enough.  
I don't know if map_vsyscall needs too much stuff to come much earlier than
it is.  
It might be best just to let native_read_tsc be inlined ;-)
Thanks,
Roland
