Hi!
Could we get the following two patches into Linus' tree as well? AFAIK,
these alone didn't do any harm; they're most useful for yenta-style
PCMCIA-PCI bridges instead... so I'd very much like to get them into 2.6.13.

http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.12/2.6.12-mm2/broken-out/gregkh-pci-pci-handle-subtractive-decode.patch
Thanks,
	Dominik
