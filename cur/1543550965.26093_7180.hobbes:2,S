Here's an idea, farfetched as it may be.
Page the entire process out to disk into a user defined area, SIGHALT it and use
printk or a kthread/userproc to notify the user that something was kicked out of
the sandbox for playing bad.  The user can add more swap if desired, then use a
userland tool w/ the kthread/userproc to pop it back into memory or destroy it
and SIGCONT.
This allows the user to make almost all decisions about what gets killed and
what remains running.  Necessarily if you're out of disk space as well we'll
have to resort to simply killing.  Hmm, sounds like 2.5.
