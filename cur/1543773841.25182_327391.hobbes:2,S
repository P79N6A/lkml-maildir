It is a bit of an edge case for any of the categories.

Probably just my not fully understanding I-PIPE (to say nothing of
not fully understanding your test setup!), but I would have expected
I-PIPE to be able to get somewhere in the handfuls of microseconds of
interrupt latency.  Looks like it prevents Linux from ever disabling
real interrupts -- my first guess after reading your email was that
Linux was disabling real interrupts and keeping I-PIPE from getting
there in time.
						Thanx, Paul
