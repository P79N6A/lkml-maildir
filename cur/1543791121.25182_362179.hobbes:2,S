As I replied in the other thread, your patch has solved the
problem.  Thank you.

Okay, I guess the irqs are not misrouted because kdump does not
touch the IO-APIC routing table, and the second kernel will
build the same one.

Well, I first thought that restoring the hardware status back to
normal before booting the second kernel is better because it may
require fewer changes on the kernel core code.
But now I'm getting the idea what kdump is trying to do.  Kdump
wants to do less in the crashed kernel, and solve problems in
the second kernel.

I think we need more test cases, especially the cases that focus
on "status" of hardware, to make kdump more reliable.  Kdump
should recover from all possible status of supported hardware.
Is anyone working on developing such test cases for kdump?
