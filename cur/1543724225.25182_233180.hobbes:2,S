Hi All,
just installed kernel version 2.6.7 on RedHat 8.0. Unfortunately i'm no 
longer able to use NFS. Are there any recent issues ? For a detailed 
problem description please see below. Any help is appreciated.
Thanks
  Martin
I have two machines..let's say A and B. On A / /boot and /sys are exported 
via /etc/exports. Machine B are mouting these sources when booting via NFS. 
Since i updated the kernel i get the following errors when machine A is 
starting the NFS services :
---
Jul 8 09:30:13 hostA exportfs: hostB:/boot: No such device
Jul 8 09:30:13 hostA exportfs: hostB:/sys: No such device
Jul 8 09:30:13 hosta exportfs: hostB:/: No such device
Jul 8 09:30:13 hostA nfs: Starting NFS services: succeeded

hostB(ro,sync,no_root_squash)

cat /etc/hosts.allow
ALL:hostB

With the old kernel 2.4.20-8 i had no problems.
NFS support is compiled into the new kernel.
