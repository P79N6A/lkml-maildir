I wasn't serious.
It was a comment to your "if you have a million inodes it's a lot of bits"
comment.
Considering that the inode is probably 200+ bytes, the million inodes case
is fairly scary. And the 4 bytes won't be that noticeable..
You'd save more by making the quota stuff go away when quotas aren't
enabled..
