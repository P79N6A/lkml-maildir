This was one of the issues I suspected (lots of hacking option) and
asked for .config also. Your __ntfs_init_inode was *huge* and the oops
Code didn't resembled to any of written in __ntfs_init_inode ...
unless you have some hardware issue (bit flips, memory/CPU, etc). When
I have time I'll also take a closer look. I don't exclude some
alignment issues either ...
