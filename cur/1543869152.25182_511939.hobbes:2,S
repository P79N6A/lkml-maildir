yeah it'd be nice if I could just call a function for it rather than
poking into kvm internals ;)

signals are *expensive* though.
If you design an interrupt interface, it'd rock if you could make it
such that it is "raise <this> interrupt within <x> miliseconds from
now", rather than making it mostly synchronous. That way irq mitigation
becomes part of the interface rather than having to duplicate it all
over the virtual drivers...
