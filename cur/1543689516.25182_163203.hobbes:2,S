Happenstance.
It's semi-trivial to do this in ext3.  You'd open the file with O_ATOMIC
and a write() would either be completely atomic or would return -EFOO
without having written anything.
The thing which prevents this is the ranking order between journal_start()
and lock_page().
It's not trivial but also not too hard to change things so that
journal_start() can rank outside lock_page() - this would also offer some
CPU savings.
Can't say that I'm terribly motivated about the feature though.
