The order-1 allocation failures where GFP_ATOMIC, because SLUB uses !0
order for everything. Kernel stack allocation is GFP_KERNEL I presume.
Also, I use 4k stacks on all my machines.
Maybe the cpumask thing needs an extended api, one that falls back to
kmalloc if NR_CPUS >> sane.
That way that cannot be an argument to inflate stacks.
