presidio_source-2k50714.tar.gz contains GPL headers and
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL") in *.[ch] files and even the GPL text in COPYING;
however, apparently the module is linked with the o2media/test.o_shipped
object file, sources for which are not included.  Sources for the o2sd
part are available - maybe they contain enough information to get at
least the SD/MMC part supported.
mbx-nonATA.zip also contains drivers with MODULE_LICENSE("GPL") linked
with binary-only parts; unfortunately, the object files have been
stripped and therefore are unusable.  There are also strange files like
ntddk.h there, which contain GPL notice sticked in front of the
Microsoft copyright notice.  And OpenSource/mbx-v2.4.x/WdmLib.c contains
lots of copied code from other places, including:
/*
 * Regular lowlevel cardbus driver ("yenta")
 *
 * (C) Copyright 1999, 2000 Linus Torvalds
 */
And they link this with that o2ext.o binary...
