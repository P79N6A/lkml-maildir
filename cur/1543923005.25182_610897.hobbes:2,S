Hi,
Recently I noticed that my system resumes just after suspend to disk.
I traced this to commit 9cd9a0058dd35268b24fa16795a92c800f4086d4.
Note:
This happens only if I enable WOL using /proc/acpi/wakeup
(echo "ILAN" > /proc/acpi/wakeup)
and have 
"ACPI-Hibernate-erroneously-disabled-Suspend-wakeup" applied, since otherwise
all wake-up sources are disabled in S4.
Clearly the above commit confuses the BIOS.
Using latest -git with the above patch reverted makes everything work again fine.
Best regards,
	Maxim Levitsky
