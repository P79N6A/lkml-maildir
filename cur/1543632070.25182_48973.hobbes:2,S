Subject: [PATCH]: mmap packet socket information leak (trivial)

Hi,
Here is a quick patch which blanks the mmap() packet socket buffer areas
before using them. Previously you would get uninitialised data inbetween
the data structures where they are TPACKET_ALIGNED().
The root user could potentially unwittingly save this data to a file and
distribute it not knowing his password was in it or whatever... Not very
likely but its worth fixing IMHO :)
Regards
