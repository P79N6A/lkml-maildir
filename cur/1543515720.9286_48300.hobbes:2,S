Jeff, you either already have a root filesystem -- which may be ext2 or
nwfs or any bloody thing -- or you don't.  If you don't, you don't have
ANY USERSPACE WHATSOEVER.  There is no user config you could call.
If you need userspace to mount your root filesystem, you have to use
initrd, and then you can have the associated /dev nodes on the ramdisk
just fine.
