Is it REALLY necessary to prevent them from seeing an inconsistent
state?  Seems to me that in the total picture (i.e. system wide) they
will never see a consistent state, so why be concerned with a small
corner of the system.  Let them figure it out, possibly by consistency
checks, if they care.  It just seems unhealthy to demand consistency at
the cost of delays that will only make other data even more
inconsistent. And if the delay is _forever_ from a tool that may be used
to diagnose system problems...  I would rather a tool that repeatedly
showed the same inconsistent state than one that hangs because it can
not get a consistent one.
