I'm not sure...this is rather platform-specific, so I don't think it
really belongs in the atmel_serial() driver. One solution might be to
add a function pointer to struct atmel_uart_data that the driver can
call from ->suspend() in order to let the platform code handle this as
appropriate.
Cc'ing Andrew Victor and David Brownell since they know the AT91
platform code better than me.
