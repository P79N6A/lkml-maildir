Trond,
I agree my patch is wrong that it cuts off long directories, I should 
have noticed this sooner.
However, I don't think it is a glibc 2.1 issue, I first noticed this 
problem using the stock RH5.2 glibc, I upgraded to 2.1 to see it that was 
the problem and it did not go away.
I don't know the source of this problem, there definitely is a short (93
entries) directory that does not get the EOF bit set correctly, any hints
of where to look would be appreciated.  I do believe my analysis of the
possible infinite loop if the EOF bit does not get set is correct. 
I'll take another look and let you know if I figure anything out, maybe 
even correctly this time.
thanks for your help,
