Yeah, that's definitely a problem, and would be a firmware bug.  There's 
no doubt that firmwares have had trouble with this in the past, but 
given that Vista now relies on this stuff working, it's a lot more 
likely to be reliable in current and future systems.

I don't disagree there.  I'm just saying the actual mechanism is fine 
(as illustrated by the numerous non-PC ports of Linux), and this 
particular problem, at least, isn't really specific to how MMCONFIG is 
described or configured by the firmware and OS, it's simply a Linux 
problem.
But like I said, the per-device flag Arjan suggested is fine with me...
