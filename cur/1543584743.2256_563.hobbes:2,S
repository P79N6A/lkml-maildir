Subject: [PATCH] remove duplicate Configure.help entries in 2.4.2-ac18
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/3/10/64

As of 2.4.2-ac18, there are two CONFIG options which have two entries
in Documentation/Configure.help.
These are CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_TCPMSS and CONFIG_DEBUG_IOVIRT.
The first of these has two identical entries, so this patch deletes the duplicate
entry.
The second, CONFIG_DEBUG_IOVIRT, has a second but different entry in
Configure.help.  I've merged one perhaps useful line from that second (and
therefore ignored) entry into the first one.  The new line (updated) is:
"This can be very useful for porting drivers from 2.2 to 2.4."
You can see the original comment near the end of the patch, where the
second entry is deleted.
This patch is against 2.4.2-ac18.

-       1) Web browsers connect, then hang with no data received.

-  Workaround: activate this option and add a rule to your firewall
