read the -noleaf description on the find man page to see why we need to
set the directory link count to 1 when we are lying to userspace about
the actual link count on directories. 
find isn't the only program that makes this assumption (it's just the
only one I can think of ;-)
Other than that the patch (the second one diffed against the correct
tree) looks sane.
