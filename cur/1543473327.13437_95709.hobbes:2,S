You've hit the nail right on the head: your patch was obviously
rejected for moral reasons.  It's still December, a month when most
or all religions--even emacs--have holidays.  Try waiting until the

to drown his new year's resolutions in bubbly is far stronger than
his religious convictions ever could be.
