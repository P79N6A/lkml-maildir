Don't think so - local_t operations are performed atomically, which is
not required for most hotpath page statistics operations since proper
locks are already held.
What is wanted for these cases are simple inc/dec (non-atomic)
instructions, which is what Nick's patch does by introducing
__mod_page_state.
Ben, have you tested mm-page_state-opt.patch? It should get rid of
most "flags" save/restore on stack.
