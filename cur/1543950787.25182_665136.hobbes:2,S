Folks, as I get time I will try with both :)
I suspect the CAP_MAC_ADMIN will mean containers won't be able to do any
policy updates without an update to smack to do a CAP_NS_OVERRIDE type
of thing.  For SELinux I've got my hopes on the userspace policy daemon,
but first (my next step atm) I need to get the namespace thing going
(vserver1.root_t etc).
