I agree.  But the aim of this fix is to keep as much compatibility as
possible by making only >2TB file incompatible(RO).  So I didn't add
typedef for ext3 block type.
Now I'm working on changing the type of variables related to block,
including ext3_fileblk_t.  I'll send the update patches later.
Cheer, sho
