You're getting lost in the details...  the scope of the anonvma change 
is _everybody_.  If you accept the premise that we are in a _stable_ 
kernel series, the core goal should be stability.  Non-trivial VM 
changes like this do not enhance stability in the short term, even if 
they are a good idea in the long run.  It's the whole idea behind 
minimizing changes and breakage in a stable series.
You've got all the major Linux vendors preparing (or releasing) 
2.6.x-based product and IMO the 2.6 kernel is still a moving target, 
with non-trivial behavior (and sometimes API) changes every couple of 
kernel versions.
