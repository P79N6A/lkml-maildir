Peculiar?  Probably...  :)
In my [no doubt warped] brain, I equate the SFF-8038 interface to "PCI 
IDE BMDMA", and from there, view most hardware as a subset of PCI IDE 
BMDMA.  It might not do DMA, might not be PCI, might not do irqs, but 
most PATA hardware seems able to be driven by a "bmdma driver".  Thus, 
the name :)
