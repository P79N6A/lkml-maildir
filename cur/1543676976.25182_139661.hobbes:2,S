Two patches to Documentation/SendingPatches.
This one moves "Include PATCH in the subject" earlier in the to-do list,
and adds two new items: "Follow the chain (or 'why is Linus ignoring me')",
and "Listen to feedback".
It's against 2.5.70.
Changes since last version: two typos fixed (s/Lieutanant/Lieutenant), and
"log rolling" comments into seperate patch, on general principles.

+These days, Linus is too overwhelmed to reliably accept patches directly
+from developers he doesn't know.  Furthermore, Linus is unlikely to respond
+to unsolicited email, since he gets so much of it he reads most with the
+delete key.  If your patch is being repeatedly ignored, resending it more than
+a few times can get frustrating.  There's a better way.
+
+The slow but steady way to get patches into the development kernel is a three
+step process:
+
+  A) Get the maintainer's approval.
+  B) Get the subsystem lieutenant's approval.
+  C) Get it to Linus.
+
+The maintainer is listed in the MAINTAINERS file.  This is the first person
+you should approach with your patch, as they're the only ones who owe you
+any kind of response if they've never heard of you before.  (Notice they
+do not owe you a _polite_ response.  Be nice.)
+
+Maintainers report to lieutenants, which are like subsystem maintainers.
+There are over a hundred maintainers, but only about a dozen lieutenants.
+They're not listed anywhere, but the maintainer you contact should know who
+they report to.  (If the maintainer doesn't respond after a week or so,
+you could try asking on linux kernel.)  The maintainer may take your patch
+and forward it on themselves, or sign off on it and send you on to the
+appropriate lieutenant with their blessing but not their spare time.
+
+Lieutenants report to Linus.  They're the only people who can ding him
+for not answering their email.  Linus responds fairly reliably to his
+lieutenants, lieutenants respond to maintainers, and maintainers should
+respond to you.  If you follow the chain, at each stage you will be talking
+to somebody who more or less owes you an answer, even if that answer is "no".
+
+The farther away from Linus people are, the more time they're likely to have
+to respond to your email.  The response may be "no, that's a bad idea", but
+it's better than being left hanging.
+
+11) Listen to feedback.
+
+If a maintainer, lieutenant, or Linus tells you something specific is wrong
+with your patch, this is a GOOD thing.  It means you've been given the
+opportunity to fix it.  It's not meant to be discouraging, if they wanted to
+discourage you they'd either ignore you or explicitly tell you to stop
+bothering them.
+
+If Linus himself replies to you by telling you your patch has something wrong
+with it, you have just been encouraged.  Same goes for lieutenants and
+maintainers.  When they tell you what you need to do to make the thing
+palatable to them, you've been given the opportunity to fix it and resubmit.
