Sun SS20 which I administer via a serial console connection to a nearby i386 
linux box, running a patched RedHat-5.1. Fresh compile of 2.2.12, with support 
packages like mount and modutils duly upgraded.
SILO did it's thing, finds the new image, uncompresses it and boots on the 
new kernel . . . it even gets as far as:
Turning on user and group quotas for local filesystems                          Setting clock: Sun Sep  5 18:09:11 PDT 1999                                     Enabling swap space.

At this point the machine is ping-able, but does not seem to fire up any 
services, and I don't see anything more which looks like a boot sequence on 
the serial console. So I hit return on the serial link just to see if it would 
still scroll.
The kernel OOPSed at this point. All kinds of nasty stuff written to the 
console. I tried sending a few breaks via minicom, but they were useless, 
eventually the screen just settled into a tight, seemingly uninterruptible 
loop:
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 40001000              Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 40001000              Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 40001000              Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 40001000             
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 40001000              Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 40001000
which scrolls endlessly, very rapidly.
Is this a known issue with kernel-2.2.12 on sparc hardware? I've seen one 
other report in the archives.
