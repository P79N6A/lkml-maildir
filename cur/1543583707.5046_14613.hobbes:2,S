Notice that up() is triggered _only_ on the clr_fd() - until then
->lo_pending is at least 1. Lo_rundown is exactly that - mode when
we've already given that barrier up and just wait for the last
guy to up that semaphore while loop_thread queue is empty. Which
will make loop_thread terminate.
	BTW, I think I see a possible problem. How about replacing
atomic_dec() in loop_thread with
		if (atomic_dec_and_test(...))
			break;
to handle the case where we have pending requests at the clr_fd time
and the last one happens to be in the queue?
