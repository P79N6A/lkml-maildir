I'm not so sure---it's very attractive for data acquisition
devices to throw generic UDP packets onto the net to be vacuumed
up by general-purpose machines.  (Multicast can be nice
here too; load balancing, redundancy.)
For example, UDP goes nicely into an FPGA.  TCP would be almost
unthinkable.  Even a UDP back channel for roll-your-own simpler
flow control would be almost as bad; also, any flow control
restricts you to unicast.
