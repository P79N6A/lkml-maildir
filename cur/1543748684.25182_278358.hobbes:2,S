Hello,
With kernel 2.6.10-rc3 and 256 M RAM, when I start a task taht eats a ot of 
RAM (for example, viewing a big TIFF file; also tested with a synthetic 
"eater"), in the resulting swapping process kswapd tahes quite a bit of CPU 
time. The computer becomes extremely unresponsive, the clock (in icewm) stops 
for periods of time up to a minute). And the task startup itself is somewhaat 
slow.
I have checked both 2.6.8.1 and 2.6.9 for comparison, and they fare a lot 
better. The CPU hogging is not there, the computer is much more responsive, 
and the task starts faster.
