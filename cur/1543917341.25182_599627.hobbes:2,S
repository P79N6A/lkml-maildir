Are segments being sent full-sized, or is there perhaps some Nagle 
component in it as well? I.e., are the applications using TCP_NODELAY?

I think somebody, probably Alexey, enabled sending of ACK on every 2nd 
segment. Previously small segment senders playing with Nagle were 
complaining every now and then about performance because two small 
segments did not generate ACKs but one had to accumulate, IIRC, half MSS 
worth of data before ACK was sent. Could this be related to your case?

Congestion control is basically ACK clocked math for cwnd, ssthresh, etc.
state, which then results in permission to send new segments out etc. 
(except for RTO part of course, which I'll ignore in the next statement). 
Any delay gaps to sent packet after ACK receival, which triggered the 
state changing math, isn't there due to congestion control but due to 
other factors! 40ms is much below MIN_RTO (200ms), so it shouldn't be due 
to RTO either... Note that also delayed ACKs are exception to the general 
rule.
Congestion control is controlled like your CPU is. In your CPU there's 
this whatever GHz clock which determines when the state changing events 
take place, state changes don't just happen arbitarily but are _clocked_ 
(ACK _clocked_ in case of congestion control). Of course there will be 
some propagation delay after the change to put in effect all the state 
changes that are result of what occurred at clock edge (and this delay 
assimilating to processing delay in the context of congestion control).
