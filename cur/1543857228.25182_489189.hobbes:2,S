The 2.4 numbers look correct (slightly slower), the 2.6 numbers do not.
Nothing obviously wrong from the traces however. If you pin the bzip to a
given processor do you get different results according to which CPU ?
(see man taskset for info on the commands)
If you get very different times on the two processors that will be very
useful information.
