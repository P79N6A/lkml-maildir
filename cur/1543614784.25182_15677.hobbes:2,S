Doesn't this statement miss the point that the configure stuff belongs with
the associated source, for many reasons?  Reasons being stuff like Linus'
desire to see PPC stuff only under the PPC directories, stuff like the
desire to have the config stuff as part of the source.  The very fact 
that they are atoms and don't interact with each seems to scream that they
should be located next to, or in, the stuff with which they do interact.
