I would also be interested in this.  For instance the AIC7xxx driver has
every PCI id in the module I think in the .modinfo section which is not
truely required once depmod has been run.  I wanted to strip out this
information so that modules would be smaller.  I had stripped this section
out in testing a floppy boot and then most modules would not load anymore.
