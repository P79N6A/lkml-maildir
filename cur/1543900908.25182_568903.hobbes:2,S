Okay, I have thought it through and I think that, as an initial step, we can do
something like this:
- preload the image-saving kernel before hibernation
- in the hibernation code path replace device_suspend() with the shutting down of
  all devices without unregistering them (not very nice, but should be sufficient
  for a while)
- when we've called device_power_down() and save_processor_state(), jump to
  the image-saving kernel and let it run
- make the image-saving kernel set up everything, save the image without
  starting any user space (we may use the existing image-saving code for this
  purpose, with some modifications) and power off the system (or make it enter
  S4)
- use the existing restoration code to load the image and jump to the
  hibernated kernel
- in the restore code patch replace device_resume() with the reprobing of all
  devices.
