That would be nice.  (Aside: Can NFSv4 do anything like dnotify, or am I
restricted to, in effect, keeping many files open to detect changes in
any of them?)
Generally NFSv4 sounds like the way to go.  Should I be recommending
it to all my friends yet, is the implementation ready for that?

You're right, in the cases I describe "noac" is fine.
I don't like having to ship an FAQ with a program which explains that
the program is theoretically fine, users should simply mount their
home directory with "noac", and tough if that's not within their
administrative power.
I'd rather make the program work correctly with the default mount
options, and maybe have an entry in the FAQ saying that "noac" may
improve performance but is not required for correct behaviour.
Unfortunately that means ugly knowledge of filesystem specifics and
/proc/mount parsing - or significantly lower performance on local
filesystems, which largely negates the purpose of the program.  (It is
very much about caching things derived from file contents).

Server = RH linux-2.4.20-18.9.  Client = 2.6.0-test6.  I have done
this in the last few days:
	[on client] editing file in emacs, save-buffer
	[on server] diff -ur mumble commands >> file
		    (and wait until command prompt returns)
	[on client] in emacs, find-alternate-file which discards the
		    current buffer and opens & reads the file from fs.
	[on client] edit some more, save file, post to l-k etc.
	[meta]	    notice that the diff wasn't appended to the file
Emacs didn't see the appended data.  (The reason I did the diff command
on the server is that it's a lot faster - a tree's worth of stat calls
is slow over PCMCIA ethernet).

Of course they make a difference when there is no call to say "just do
X and hide the implementation details from me".  What I'd like is an
abstraction so I don't observe a difference, or at least a systematic
way of working around them at application level.
In the same way I expect CPUs to abstract away the (sometimes very)
complex memory caching models, and present something simple to the
program code.
