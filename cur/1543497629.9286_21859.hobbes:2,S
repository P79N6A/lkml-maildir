Hello,
 I recently installed redhat 6.0 on one of my boxes. I then upgraded my kernel
(no rpm I hate rpming kernels) to 2.2.9. Everytime I run top ps or a bunch of
other programs I get the following warning:
Warning: /boot/System.map has an incorrect kernel version.     
I have never seen this before and I think I did everything like normal...
Can anyone explain this to me? I started to think about it and I do not know
what any of the files in /boot do...
Thanks a lot...
