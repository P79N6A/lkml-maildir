Yes.  ACPI0004 could be used as well.  Actually, PNP0A05 is
redefined as "Generic Container Device" in ACPI spec2.0c.
According to that, both PNP0A05 and ACPI0004 behave
almost the same way.  PNP0A05 also sounds nice for me:)

If ACPI ASL is written that way, LHNS cannot do anything since
there is no container device (this is not ACPI term here) in the
system.  LHNS's target is a container *device* (again, not ACPI
term:) and hotplugs it physically (of course, the device needs to
be hotpluggable).  So, LHNS can handle a NUMA node if all
CPUs and memory of the node are on a container device. I know
that it's a big restriction :(
