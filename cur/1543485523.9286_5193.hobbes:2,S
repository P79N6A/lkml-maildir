    And where might those of us interested obtain said supplies? 
For the console the canonical place would be kbd-0.97.tar.gz.
I do not know whether there are official X releases that have
Euro support.  There is a patch kit EURO by Guylhem Aznar that
adds Euro support to X and console.  No doubt freshmeat or ftpsearch
will tell you where to find it.
