Dear Jens,
the problem accours also under 2.6.7.
But the hdc=cdrom options solves this problem (under 2.6.8.1):
..............
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 7.00alpha2
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
NFORCE3-150: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:00:08.0
NFORCE3-150: chipset revision 165
NFORCE3-150: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
NFORCE3-150: 0000:00:08.0 (rev a5) UDMA133 controller
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xf008-0xf00f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:DMA
hdc: ATAPI cdrom (?)
Using anticipatory io scheduler
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
hdc: ATAPI 48X DVD-ROM drive, 256kB Cache
Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.20
..............
As written bevore the drive is not recognised only with an audio cd in it.
Thanks
Lars
