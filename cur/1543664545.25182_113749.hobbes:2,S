And as you and i already hashed out on the rsync list mutt is
perfectly happy and fully functional with noatime,nodiratime
because it updates the atime manually which still works.
As the headers indicate i'm using mutt,  It spots new mail 
in other mboxes just fine with noatime turned on.  I get the
"Inc:" count, c<tab> works, and folder lists indicate
correctly which folders have been updated since last visit.
Perhaps you are thinking of another MUA or an oooold version
of mutt?
