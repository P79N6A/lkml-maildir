Alan, you want an ISP to configure identical machines for linux routers
just so they can hotswap NICs? What have you been putting in your tea 
lately 8)
Clustering synchronous serial routers? Thatd be a neat trick. Yes cisco
has HSRP but its not quite the same thing and you cant have both ciscos
going to the same T1 RJ45 jack on the telco demarc.
Yes you can failover your mail server, but your core linux routers are
another story and thats where hotswap really counts. Customers can
tolerate short mailserver outages but they cant tolerate short router
outages.
