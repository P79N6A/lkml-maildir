Subject: how can one bypass the automatic loopback?

I have 5 ethernet ports in my computer and I am debugging ethernet drivers.
Two ports are looped back externally with crossed 10baseT wire.
No matter what I have tried I am unable send a ping (that will be responded too) 
through that cable.
eth3      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:00:BC:11:19:FC  
          inet addr:192.168.2.2  Bcast:192.168.2.255  Mask:255.255.255.255
eth4      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:40:95:D2:C2:85  
          inet addr:192.168.3.1  Bcast:192.168.2.255  Mask:255.255.255.255
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
192.168.3.1     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 eth3
192.168.2.2     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 eth4
If I ping 192.168.2.2 the kernel 'knows' that we are already at the destination
and short circuits that packet before it ever gets down to the hardware.
I get about .2 ms ping time and ifconfig reveals that no packets  were
transmitted or received by the hardware.
Is there any way around this?
P.S.  I know that I can add a route to a bogus host on eth3 and ping it, then I
will at least see the packets going on the wire, but I cannot ping myself by way
of this external loopback cable.
