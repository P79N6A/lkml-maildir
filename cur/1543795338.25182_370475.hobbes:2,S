You need a driver to collect and report all the ECC single bit errors to
the user so that they can decide if they have problem hardware.
EDAC is more than one thing
	- Control response to a fatal error
	- Report non-fatal events for analysis/user decision making
Hardware scrubbing is good, but knowing the rate of non-fatal errors and
the trend in rate of errors is essential to planning and management of
systems.

The Intel I have looked at generates MCE if the L2/L1/bus parity errors
but not on a RAM ECC error as that is memory controller not CPU level.
That usually asserts NMI. Same for most older chips PIII/AMD Athlon etc

Varies a lot again. Hopefully that'll simplify as/when/if Intel put the
memory controller on CPU.
