I've gotten this answer on my question to the current 
maintainer of procps about supporting SMP (e.g. in ps, top):
> The reason that procps doesn't support SMP information display is that
> the proc filesystem does not export it.  That has to be fixed in the
> kernel in order to fix it in procps.
any comment?
