I can confirm that it also makes my MO drive work with ide-scsi.
I could also successfully write 4.1 GB of data to a DVD+RW disc.
Writing 700 MB to a normal CD-RW disc also worked (yes, I know I
could use ide-cd for this, I just did this for testing the ide-scsi
fix).
This patch seems to solve all my 2.6 ide-scsi problems.
Andrew, you can drop the atapi-mo-support patches from -mm if you
like. That patch only works with 2048 byte sector discs, while
the ide-scsi/sd solution also works with 512 and 1024 byte sector
discs.
