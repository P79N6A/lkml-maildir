Linux should report canonical names. If card is ne2000, it should be
called ne2000, no matter how vendor calls it. 
If dlink takes rtl8029 cards, and renames them to dlink ct528, the
SHOULD BE REPORTED AS RTL8029, unless linux can see the difference. It
currently can't and need not see the difference, so leave it that way.
