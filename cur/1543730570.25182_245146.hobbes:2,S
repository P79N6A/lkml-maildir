But it isn't, that's the point.

Nothing personal here.  The GPL code has a exported symbol explicitly to
be able to load a closed source decoder module.  Because of that, I've
deleted that symbol (and the surrounding logic, as it's no longer
needed.)  One could also argue that no in-kernel code needs that symbol
exported, so it should be removed for that reason alone.
That's all I've done.  The in-kernel module still works the same as it
always did if you never used the closed source decoder.
thanks,
