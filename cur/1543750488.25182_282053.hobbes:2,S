i386 architecture details are really not my thing, so I'm going to
trust you on most of this, but this bit:

does not look right to me.  Before, we'd get an 0x80|SIGTRAP result
from wait.  Now, you've moved the 0x80 to live only inside the siginfo.
This is accessible to the debugger via ptrace, but only very recently
(late 2.5.x).  So this will probably break users of PT_TRACESYSGOOD.
