The ICH4 IDE on my ASUS P4PE had the exact same problem, but the -ac pathes
make it hum along very nicely. Requring the PIIX driver, though, seems a
little wonky. Without -ac, the controller is detected as "ICH4" and doesn't
work. With the -ac patches, it works, but is detected as PIIX. Rather
confusing. Perhaps the the Configure.help should mention the ICH4?
2.4.19-vanilla didn't work. The first patch tried was 2.4.19-ac4, and that
worked. Now on 2.4.20-rc4-ac1 and all is still good.
I hope the workarounds for this get merged into 2.4.21-preX.

Ian Morgan
