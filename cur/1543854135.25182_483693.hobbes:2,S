It would be tricky, but might be possible.  But that would be a completely
new feature -- the kernel has always hung in this case. If you think you need 
it submit a (followup) patch. But I don't think it's fair to ask Vivek to do it.
Besides i don't think it would be any useful. panic reboot only
makes sense if you can recover after reboot. But if your CPU somehow
suddenly loses its ability to run 64bit code, no reboot of the world will 
recover.
