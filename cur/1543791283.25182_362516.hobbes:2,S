I need a "Signed-off-by:" line in order to be able to add it.  Care to
redo things based on the comments you have had and resend it with this

We don't use $Id within the kernel tree, please remove this.

No new proc files will be added for drivers, please use sysfs instead
(with only one file per value.)

No, use the async firmware download mode instead of this.  That will
solve all of your problems.

Why create a macro for such a simple thing?  That's not needed.

Why do you need a header file for a single .c file?
