This depends on the sylpheed version / options...
Sylpheed-claws v2.0 has many options for wrapping:
	Wrap on input
	Wrap before sending
	Wrap quotation
	Wrap pasted text
And everything can be ON/OFF.
The only bad thing is that the "Insert File" function is affected by
"Wrap on input" option... so the best way to insert patches is to PASTE
them OR disable every wrapping option and wrap paragraphs with
"Ctrl+L" :)
