When I remove my network card running with a staticly defined ip address
the modules removes itself just fine and the computer keeps on kickin...
inset and remove works just fine over and over.  As soon as I go to DHCP
it works fine until the first removal.  The card doesn't totaly
unresgister and the 3c589 and pcmcia-core modules don't remove.  The only
error I can find is an ioctl error.

P.S.  I know I am being vauge but I don't know exactly where to look for
errors.
