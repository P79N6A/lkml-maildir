Note that many hardware options can only be auto-detected if the
relevant driver is loaded. For example, the attached script only
detects the printer port if the RUNNING kernel currently includes
support for the printer port.
This implies that the autoconfig script needs to follow something
like the following algorithm for each option - I'll use parallel
port support for this example, but it applies to many other options
in a similar manner as well:
 1. Is there a printer port listed in /proc/ioports here? If so,
    enable this option and finish, else go to step 2.
 2. Can we determine that the driver for the printer port is
    currently loaded? If so, go to step 3, else go to step 5.
 3. Is the driver for the printer port currently loaded? If so,
    disable this option and finish, else go to step 4.
 4. Can we load the driver for the printer port as a module? If
    so, load it and go to step 1, else go to step 5.
 5. Ask the user whether to include parallel port support.

How does one deal with the fact that the settings that work on one
configuration do NOT work on another?
As an example of this, take my two systems. I have a USR Sportster
33k6/VoiceFax modem, and I need to set it up DIFFERENTLY for the two
systems. OK, both have it set for COM3 at 0x3E8, but on one, I need to
set it to use IRQ5 and on the other I need to set it to use IRQ2/9.

I have to admit that I don't use xconfig myself, much preferring
menuconfig, but that's just personal preference...

Good - but note that there will be (probably large) parts of it that
are architecture-dependant - the processor model detection for
starters...
