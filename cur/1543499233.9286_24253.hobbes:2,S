If you can backtrack to the actual error, you're extremely lucky in my
experience.

The result being that you normally have just as much idea where the
error actually is in both of the above cases - ie, none whatsoever.

In my experience, error reports can be broken down into the following
four categories:
 1. Syntax errors, or errors of coding that prevent the program
    from compiling correctly. These are all detected straight away,
    and are the easiest errors to fix.
 2. Linking errors, or errors that permit the program to compile,
    but prevent it from linking into a valid executable. These are
    also detected straight away, and are the next easiest errors
    to fix.
 3. Trapped logical errors, or errors for which the program checks
    at the point where the error may occur. Because they are trapped,
    these errors are relatively easy to fix as one knows exactly
    where to look for the error based on the error message. As a
    result, most programs over 6 months old have few of these left.
 4. Untrapped logical errors, or errors for which no check is made
    by the program at the point where the error may occur. Because
    they are NOT trapped, these errors are extremely hard to locate.
Errors in the first two categories can basically be ignored as far as
this discussion is concerned, and in my experience, the split between
the last two categories tends to be 25% for (3) and 75% for (4), and
the easiest way to determine which category they're in is by how clear
the error message is.
Difficult to understand error messages are inevitably also old ones,
usually ones that made sense when they were first written, but for
which their original meaning no longer applies, and their appearance
generally indicates an error in category (4) for which the only thing
one can safely say is that the actual error will be nowhere near the
error message.
On the other hand, an error message that's easy to understand usually
indicates an error in category (3) and thus one that's easily tracked
down and fixed.
Personally, I'd love to see something along the lines of a kernel
orientated assert() macro inserted throughout the kernel, with the
property that if the condition listed therein was false, it reported
the fact to some systrace facility (perhaps using syslog) so one could
use that as an additional aid when tracking down problems. If it was
implemented properly, then the ONLY reports it produced would relate
to assumptions kernel writers both made and documented that were not
valid.
Best wishes from Riley.
