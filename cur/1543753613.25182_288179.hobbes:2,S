Gar, this is the 3rd copy of this patch I've got.
I wanted the dust to settle on the agp carnage in -mm before
merging anything else, but tbh, I'm so sick of the sight
of this patch coming around every few days I'm going to merge
it and let Andrew deal with any resulting breakage when he
cuts the next -mm
