This is a "damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't" situation.  Anyway, I've 
never liked the idea of loading up the kernel with a bunch of preset 
blacklist entries.  For most users that are a waste of space, and unneeded 
entries almost never get removed.

The problem is that the system can't always tell that a reset is needed.  
There might be no symptoms at all.  For example, I've got a USB keypad 
which doesn't work right after a resume -- key presses never get sent to 
the computer.  As far as the system can tell the device is fine, though.
