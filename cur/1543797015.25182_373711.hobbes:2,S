Sorry about using all those cryptic terms. I was trying to explain with
the help of few test scenario's. I had tested on couple of PowerPC processor
based machines which can be configured either as a standalone machine 
[ Without any Logical Partitions ] or can be logically partitioned.
One can use a Hardware Management console [HMC] to manage the machine.

The point i was trying to make was to have a consistent behavior across
virtual and real consoles connected to certain kind of machines. 
But as stated by you this patch might cause lot of inconvenience to 
other user. So it's best not to introduce this patch.
