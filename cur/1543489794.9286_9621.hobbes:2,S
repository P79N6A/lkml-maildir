I would not call it breaking stat. Every /proc parser that does not know how to 
cope with additional fields is badly broken. I had expected that this 
ugly practice would have been stomped out by evolutionary methods in the 2.1
cycle - if not it is time. If you worry about this stuff it could be moved
to a new /proc file too. 
I do not expect this patch will get included in the 2.2.x series though,
but of course it is a very useful feature for all these people bragging
about SMP scalability @)

The changes are very simple. I can supply a patch.

Exactly what I had in mind. Actually I'm surprised that Linux doesn't do 
that already @)
