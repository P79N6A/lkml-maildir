[snip successful run of kexec_test]
Hmm.  So it looks like you can make bios calls, on the NUMAQ machine.
It is worth a try to see if "kexec --real_mode bzImage...." will start
up your kernel.   Probably not but at least the basic mechanism of kexec
is working.  I would be very surprised if you couldn't at least start
a uniprocessor kernel.

From your kexec_test run, your memory map...

The e820 memory map is printed out on boot up.

Most will have pretty much the same memory map, but in general all systems
with same amount of ram will have different memory maps.

Yep, essentially that is what needs to happen.
