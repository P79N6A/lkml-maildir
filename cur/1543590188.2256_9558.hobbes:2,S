Szaka-
I would considier what you're suggesting to be a refinement on this
patch.  The first problem is to generate valid core dumps for all
threads.  Adding in policy decisions about which threads actually
generate core files can be done later.
Adam ? (I'm sorry, I've lost the mail with his full name) actually
posted a patch a while back that only dumped core for the first
faulting thread.  The problem with this patch is that it didn't
deal with the potential races between threads modifying the memory
maps while the core dump was being generated.  Also, this patch used
a single system wide variable to make its policy decisions, this
really needs to be a per-process decision.
What I'd really like to see is some sort of rondezous capability where,
when a fatal exception occurs, all the threads are halted, appropriate
core dumps are generated, and then all the threads are resumed (to
terminate or continue as appropriate).  This is a bigger project that
will require a little thought.
