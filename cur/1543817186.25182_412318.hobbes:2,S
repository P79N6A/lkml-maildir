If you have CONFIG_KALLSYMS enabled then the kernel should print the name
of the function at that address.  It's pretty hard to turn off
CONFIG_KALLSYMS, actually.
If you _do_ have CONFIG_KALLSYMS enabled then something bad has happened -
you can look up those addresses with `nm -n vmlinux > foo' then searching
through foo.  (Or use addr2line, or gdb, or other things...)
