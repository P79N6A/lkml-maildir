2.6.1-mm5 didn't get very far, only about a page of bootup messages.
The last two were:
NET registered protocol family 1
NET registered protocol family 10
And then nothing.  I tried twice - sysrq+B worked the first
time, not the second.  There were no oops or other messages.
I used the new mregparm=3 option - it works for 2.6.1-mm4
