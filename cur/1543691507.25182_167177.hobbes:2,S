I wasn't talking about suspending, but about processor C-states. These
are power states that the mobile processors enter dynamically, many
times a second. In my case:
[10:52] tnuctip:/usr/src/linux#cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power 
active state:            C3
default state:           C1
bus master activity:     00000000
states:
    C1:                  promotion[C2] demotion[--] latency[000] usage[00000520]
    C2:                  promotion[C3] demotion[C1] latency[001] usage[00159073]
   *C3:                  promotion[--] demotion[C2] latency[100] usage[02297764]
[13:28] tnuctip:/usr/src/linux#
As you can see, C3 (lowest power) is being used a lot. This makes my
laptop run cool. If I use usb-uhci, the processor is never able to go
into C3 because of DMA activity. uhci is better, because it at least
permits me to use C3 when there are no devices plugged in.
And going back to the uhci problem... ?
