damn, and it just booted ;)
I'm just a little bit concerned over the ever-expanding inode.  Do you
think the dual sequence numbers can be replaced by a single generation

I do think that we should push the revalidate operation over into the vm_ops. 
That'll require an extra arg to ->nopage, but it has a spare one anyway (!).
