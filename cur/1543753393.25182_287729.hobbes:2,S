Jeff,
As long as 2.4.30 is planned at all, I have no more
worries for the moment. But if so, then please don't
waste your time looking over the current version. In
about a week there should really be another one out.
It will add RAID10, and get rid of the "claim disks
for RAID" mis-feature. I'll let everybody know, of course.
Thanks,
