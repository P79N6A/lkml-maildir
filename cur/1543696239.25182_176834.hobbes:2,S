Yes, more baggage from old failover code, we should be able to kill it.

No.  We've had this IOWR problem since the inception of 5.x series
driver.  Software (SMS 3.0) has been built on top of the this IOCTL
interface.  We painfully discovered this problem when we began to look
at other non-x86 platforms (ppc64).

The better (right) fix would be to push this interface change onto the
caller of the IOCTLs where they can manage the differences there, and
the driver could once and for all shed itself of this nagging problem.
That is the consensus here.  The _BAD conversion was only done so the
driver would compile.
