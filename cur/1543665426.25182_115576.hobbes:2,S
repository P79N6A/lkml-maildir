oh, stupid me. yes, after selection input core support i was able to
select VT / console on VT support.
enabling this (and SRM), 2.5.63 compiled instantly.
but it won't boot now.
after typing "b" in SRM console (to start booting) and then after
choosing the kernel on the aboot (a boot loader) prompt, this is what i get:
-------
Starting kernel boot/2.5.63/vmlinux [....]
Linux version 2.5.63 #7 Wed Mar 05 [...]
halt code = 7
machine check while inPAL mode
PC = 14a0c
>>>
-------
hm, could be anything i guess. well, i'll have to google around a bit
and read even more...
Thank you,
Christian.
