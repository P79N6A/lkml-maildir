You are correct, interrupts aren't involved. However if the wait is 
interrupted by a signal, mutex_lock_interruptible will return a nonzero 
return code which needs to be checked for (and likely -ERESTARTSYS or 
-EINTR returned), otherwise the code will blindly continue as though it 
has locked the mutex even though it has not.
