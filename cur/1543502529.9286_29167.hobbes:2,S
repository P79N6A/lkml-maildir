John Osterhout gave a good presentation at Usenix several years ago
about "why threads aren't always good" (or something like that).
You can find it on his web site (I think).  It agrees with my thinking.
It seems much of the argument of "lets use C++" is the same as
"lets use threads".  Sometimes it is the right answer, very often
it is the wrong answer.
One of the problems with threads, if it shared data gets corrupted,
it is very, very difficult to analyze and debug...and it appears
to be random in many cases...
I've spent enough time debugging other peoples threads problems, the first
question I ask is "why are you using threads?"  Very seldom do I get a
good answer to this question.
