   That way I found out that receive interrupts are not enabled when DTR is 
   set and CTS cleared. When you put the signals in the other direction it 
   works! Of course CLOCAL and CREAD were both set. IMHO if CLOCAL is set the 
   driver should NOT care about the modem status lines...
Huh?  The serial driver keeps UART_IER_RDI set at all times while the
port is open.  Could you explain a bit more about what sort of
experiments you did which led you to believe this is what's going on? 
If DTR is set, then the port is opened; if CTS is cleared, then the
UART_IER_THRI bit (which is checks for *transmit* interrupts) is
cleared, for obvious reasons.
My guess is that you misinterpretd the readings.  Keep in mind that if
what you said was true, no one would be able to use the serial driver
for much of anything.....
