Subject: [PATCH 2.4.20-pre4-ac2] fix broken i810_audio DMA (?)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/8/28/252

Changes:
-remove dma reset in stop_{dac,adc}
 (from ICH4 manual: contents of all Bus master related registers to be
  reset; so, probably some registers are not re-initilized properly on
  consecutive re-opening of /dev/dsp ???)
-remove writes to OFF_CIV, instead set LVI relative to CIV
and some stuff that was already in the last diff I send to the list:
-implement a codec ID <-> IO register offset mapping
-in i810_ioctl, case SNDCTL_DSP_CHANNELS: only touch bits 20:21
 off GLOB_CNT (multichannel capabilities)
-AMD 8111 has 6 hw channels so I must have mmio (but I don't have
 any docs to verify this)
-minor fixes
