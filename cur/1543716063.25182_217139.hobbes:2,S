It seemed these two actually wanted a precise recovery of virtual
addresses and the like for flush_dcache_page() like they would have
had with pte_chains, but never got around to using it.

Maybe it's worth #ifdef'ing out core remap_file_pages() support for
those arches if all it can do is harm to them wrt. cache coherency
issues. ARM probably wouldn't mind conserving the code it otherwise
wouldn't use.
