tmpfs is usually on a hard drive, not in RAM.  It's also used for swap.

It's really handy for a /tmp and other "scratch" directories so you can
just blow it away on reboot with a mkfs.  This comes in handy if you
have information there you don't want lifted off the disk (since
rm/dd/etc won't keep data recovery services from getting it).
Yup, it's a bit of paranoia. :-)

It does come in handy in another situation: diskless clients.  If you
have enough RAM, it's faster to use a ramdisk for some small filesystems
than writing/reading over NFS constantly.
