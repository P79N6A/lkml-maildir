Slab debugging should catch double frees, but it will not attract your
attention till you see your dmesg log. kfree() will ignore NULL
pointer, from the comments in kfree
/**
  * kfree - free previously allocated memory
  * @objp: pointer returned by kmalloc.
 *
  * If @objp is NULL, no operation is performed.
<snip>
May we could have such a variant under CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB if we needed
and also change the variant kfree to BUG_ON() a NULL pointer.
