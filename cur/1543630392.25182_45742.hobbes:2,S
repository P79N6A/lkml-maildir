Subject: promise 100 controller not found on 2.5.15 boot

I'm running 2.4.18, but, in a fit of not leaving well enough alone, I'm 
trying 2.5.15.
My box has a cdrom as hdc, and hde on a promise ultra 100 controller 
(20267). /boot is  ext2 hde2 and / is ext3 on hde5.
I configured 2.5.15 with the promise pdc202xx driver ( NOT as a module 
and fixed the typo). But on boot the kernel doesn't find or load the 
promise driver. Then it can't find root and panics.
