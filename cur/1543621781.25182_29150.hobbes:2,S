This is really a problem for bkbits to solve if I understand it correctly.
Rik wants to "name" his tree.  If we the bkbits admin interface have a 
"desc" command which changes the description listed on the web pages, then
I think he'll be happy, right?  We had the same problem with the PPC tree,
people do this without realizing the implications.
I'd suggest a changeset to the config file which says 
# Don't change the description unless you are Linus.
