This is _your personal interpretation_ of what consists a "derived work" 
under the GPL.
Other people have other opinions on this issue.
Other people even have asked lawyers that said they'd disagree with 
interpretations like the one you expressed.
If someone needs advice about the legal risks of kernel modules with a 
not GPL compatible licence, he has to ask lawyers knowing the copyright 
laws of the countries he plans to distribute his products to.
This is a known grey area that has AFAIK not yet been brought to court 
in any country, and neither your personal opinion on this issue nor my 
personal opinion on this issue can replace legel advice.
