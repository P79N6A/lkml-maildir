OK, the `int $3' is part of the CONFIG_TRAP_BAD_SYSCALL_EXITS thing which I
never use.
I'm not sure what problem is actually being reported here, now you mention it.

Yup.  But are you sure that the "+ 8" is correct, given these offsets are
larger than that?

It was in rc2-mm2.

Probably it decided that some syscall got a "bad exit".  Disable
CONFIG_TRAP_BAD_SYSCALL_EXITS.

?  It's still 4-byte-aligned.

I'm suspecting this is all due to CONFIG_TRAP_BAD_SYSCALL_EXITS taking the
debug trap..
