You _still_ don't get it.   OK, the last time: kern_automount() will
always do the same thing, no matter which namespace we are it.  It
might be OK for AFS, but it's definitely unfit for any other use.
No amount of "use of (u)mount to rearrange topology" will help here -
with your code you have dentry marked, and stepping on it (in any
namespace, in any instance of that fs in a namespace) will always do
the same thing.  And that is Wrong(tm).
