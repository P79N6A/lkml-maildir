gcc/glibc support a __thread attribute to variables. As far as I can tell
this automatically makes gcc perform the relocation to the current
context using a segment register.
But its a weird ABI

 After
reading that I agree that we should stay with the cpu ops and forget about
the local and thread stuff in gcc/glibc.
