True, I added the check three times to emphasise the three different
calls which could potentially OOPS (at least upon initial
observation).  It could be optimized into 2 checks.

Yes.

This makes sense.  Did you want to update the patch for those proposed
changes (You're more familiar with the code than I - I'm reluctant to
play too much with code unless I understand what it is doing)?  I'd be
willing to test an updated patch.

I'm really not familiar with the complexities behind DMA
programming, especially when it comes to simplex devices so I'm
probably not in much of a position to finish up handling of simplex
devices.
