All I am saying is that on Windows, the driver gets no help from the
BIOS, APM, or ACPI, but yet it restores the video to full working
condition. I understand that this sounds complicated, but since there is
an implementation that already does this then I think we have to assume
it's possible. :) Perhaps we should start with older, simpler gfx hw, or
maybe POST the bios, but only as an interim solution until gfx drivers
get better in this area.
