Nobody with working brain would read it completely into memory.
One just put the block-# that are in the journal into a hash-table
and read the block out of the journal when it's requested.
Because there may be multiple copies of the same block in the
journal, one should take the newest one that can be found in
the last commited transaction.
IMHO Chris Mason already wrote such code, at least he talked about
it...
