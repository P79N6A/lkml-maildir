I was running a network stress test (sending lots of 64 byte packets
on the DLINK 4-port NIC and two EEPRO-100 NICs.  This ran for 5 minutes,
and all was good (about 12Mbps of 64byte packets)..
Then, I re-started the test with 128 byte packets.  As soon as traffic
started, the whole machine locked up.  Couldn't even ping it from another
machine.  I had to hold down the power-switch for about 5 seconds before
it reset (ie it wasn't even listening to the power-down??)
I'm using the eepro100 driver that is included in the kernel, btw.  This
used to have a lockup problem, but I thought it was fixed...
I'm going to see if I can re-produce this.  If so, can someone suggest
a way to get more/better debugging information??
Thanks,
Ben
