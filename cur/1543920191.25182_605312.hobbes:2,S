 Hello,
 I read the messages about the company list and now this CS projects list and
 I was wondering if is there any similar list of labs/universities that host
 PhD projects related to the Linux kernel. I am thinking about switching from
 physics to CS and it would be really cool to work with the kernel.
 Thanks in advance,
 Guilherme
