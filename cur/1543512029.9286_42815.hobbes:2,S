Erm, doesn't the first one break module autoloading? I would have thought
quite a lot of people used that.
AFAICS what's needed is to separate device detection from device handling -- I
don't know how much of this is done already. When devices are detected
(normally boot time except for hotplug buses), poke the user space daemon
to create the device special file, but don't load the driver. When the device
file's accessed, the normal kerneld / kmod mechanism kicks in  to load the
driver.
