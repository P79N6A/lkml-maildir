Hmmm, I'll see if that's possible, though:
- My spare cables are exact same brand
- I dont know how to 'cycle' the drive
(iirc, libata doesnt yet support hotplug and/or the old "reset the 
bus by doing echo 'scsi remove-single-device' and then 
'add-single-device" trick)
ie, is possible to avoid a reboot?
also, the drive has been running fine since late may with this cable, 
and two other identical cables/drives are still happily running. 
Also, before putting the drives into use, I did some load-testing 
(bonnie++) which they survived quite happily.
