Assuming your patch is applied:
With SCSI=m and SCSI_SATA=y this allows the static enabling of the SATA 
drivers with unwanted effects, e.g.:
- SCSI=m, SCSI_SATA=y, SCSI_ATA_ADMA=y
  -> SCSI_ATA_ADMA is built statically but scsi/built-in.o is not linked 
     into the kernel
- SCSI=m, SCSI_SATA=y, SCSI_ATA_ADMA=y, SCSI_SATA_AHCI=m
  -> SCSI_ATA_ADMA and libata are built statically but 
     scsi/built-in.o is not linked into the kernel,
     SCSI_SATA_AHCI is built modular (unresolved symbols due to missing 
                                      libata)

I do still not see how your proposed patch would have _any_ influence on 
your problem.
