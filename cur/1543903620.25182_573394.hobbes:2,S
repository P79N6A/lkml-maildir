I don't know if this is any indication.
I have no SATA drives, but I noticed booting 2.6.22-git16 x86_64 I got 
error messages with "sata slow in responding" also "EH timeout" and my 
IDE drive /dev/sda1 giving ext3 errors, ending in a  filesystem not 
clean prompt. Did fsck.ext3 using openSUSE 10.3Alpha3 DVD, that fixed a 
string of wrong inode errors. Booted an earlier kernel and turned off 
loading the sata_nv module, then 2.6.22-git16 and later 2.6.22-git17 
booted without problems, so I put it down to a motherboard problem with 
the SATA.
Regards
Sid.
