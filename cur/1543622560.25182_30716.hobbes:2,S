Now that I have upgraded my kernel to 2.4.18-pre3-ac1 mounting of a
Reiserfs partition on top of a LVM volume with bad blocks works again.
By bad blocks affected files get a "permission denied" when I try to
read them, this is what I expect.
Now my question: Can I somehow tell reiserfs to work around bad blocks
on my hard drive?
The badblocks util from ext2 finds the bad blocks and according to the
reiserfs homepage there has been a new ioctl for reiserfs to handle bad
blocks. Has this been integrated in the reiserfs version in 2.4.18 ? The
patch for 2.4.8 on the web site does not apply properly. 
My other option would be to use ext3, knowing that ext2 can handle old
and new bad blocks.
What are your sugesstions? Except for: "Go by a new hard drive" ;-) 
With Regards and thank you for your help!
