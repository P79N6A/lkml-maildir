Yeah I think the interface is settling down. You should be able to look at
the code in drivers/acpi or drivers/hotplug/acpiphp* for examples.
From looking at other Sony ACPI BIOSes I've collected, it appears that SPIC
has a hardware ID (HID) in the ACPI namespace. It seems analogous to the
Toshiba Laptop Extras device in drivers/acpi.
Indeed, I think a sonypi driver that assumes ACPI will be much shorter and
look quite different from the current one. But since we have resolved the EC
contention issues, this need not be addressed immediately.

PS IIRC there is the idea of a "platform enumerator" that will suitably
generalize the mobo enumeration function ACPI performs on x86 for other
platforms, but I don't think that has been implemented yet.
