Your impression is correct and that's the source of the mm fragmentation
trouble.

You set it by hand: set sock opt SO_SNDBUF plus sysclt_*mem_max.
For stream AF_UNIX sockets you fallback to 1 page if the allocation fails
so you don't know. For dgram sockets you'll have to do the full allocation
in one packet or you'll wait.
