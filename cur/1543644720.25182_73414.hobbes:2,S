   Ingo said that arches that cannot do cmpxchg in hardware should
   provide spinlock-based version.
That doesn't make any sense.
If cmpxchg cannot work with user bits of memory, like
cmpxchg is supposed to, it's really a crutch more than
anything else.
F.e. people will think that such systems can support DRM
correctly, they absolutely cannot.
