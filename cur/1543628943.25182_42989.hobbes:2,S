I seem to remember something about new Promise BIOS's that fix that
LBA48 issue.  Try updating the bios, and see what happens.
Looking at their bios page, I see the Ultra 100 TX2 supports LBA48, don't
see any info on the Ultra 100, Ultra 66, etc though.  I believe the 133
TX2 has it built in.
Hope this helps,
Mike
