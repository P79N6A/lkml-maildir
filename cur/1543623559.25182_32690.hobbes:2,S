I'm not terribly concerned about the issue at-hand,
here, but I am motivated by the level of idiocy that's
appearing in my inbox right now.

I'm not sure free speech or free thought was at stake
here, Jeffs; the topic
was whether the use of bitkeeper compromised open
source ideology.  Colin
(and certain members of the club) were voicing their
concerns in a
professional manner.  Reducing that concern in an
altruistic shriek against
national socialism and your "violated freedoms" is a
bit simple-minded.
Your refusal to receive the petition in an
argumentative way is indicative
of *your* inability to exchange ideas.
Mr. Merkey, I think you're better off continuing to
hand your two cents over
to Novell in the future.  
Cheers,
Kevin
