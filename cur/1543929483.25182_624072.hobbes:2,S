I have changed my new code, so now the problem is avoided.

The deadlock occurs because:
	Thread #1 has locked A for reading and is waiting for
	#2 to release B so that #1 can lock B for writing.
	Thread #3 is waiting for #1 to release A so that #3
	can lock A for writing.
	Thread #2 has locked B for writing and is waiting for
	#3 to finish using A so that #2 can lock A for reading.
So #1 is waiting for #2, #2 is waiting for #3, and #3 is waiting for 
#1.  Lockdep warns because this might happen.
Perhaps the point you're missing is that if #3 does down_write(A)  
before #2 does down_read(A) then #2 has to wait until #3 releases the
write lock.  #2 isn't allowed to sneak in front of #3; that's what
Arjan meant when he said that rwsems are fair.
The same sort of problem occurs when a thread does nested read locks on
a single rwsem.  If a different thread were to try to acquire a write
lock in between, another deadlock would occur.  That's why lockdep
warns about nested (or recursive) read locks.

I believe the idea behind lockdep is to warn about situations that
might reasonably be expected to occur.  A thread deadlocking itself by
doing down_read(A) followed immediately by down_write(A) isn't
reasonable, so lockdep doesn't worry about that possibility.

The real problem is that lockdep has to make some generalizations.  It
can't be aware of the details of every possible situation, and it
doesn't have a global view of the entire kernel, so it doesn't know
when special circumstances make deadlock impossible.
Furthermore, in this case deadlock isn't really impossible -- it could 
occur if there were a bug somewhere else in the kernel.  So lockdep was 
correct to warn that deadlock might occur.
