This is very suspect...
This BUG is triggered if raid5 receives a read request while there is
already an outstanding read request that overlaps the new one.
i.e. this->sector  < that->sector and
     this->sector + this->size > that->sector
I admit that my understanding of ext3 isn't perfect, but I would be VERY
surprised if ext3 would ever submit overlapping requests.  
I guess it could happen if the filesystem were corrupted (and two
files claimed to own the same block) but I doubt that is the case
here.
I suspect there is a problem somewhere else.. in the VM maybe??
You could try this patch.  It might hide the real problem, or it might
cause it to manifest in some other way.
It changes the raid5 behaviour so that if an overlap is found, it
doesn't BUG, but instead waits a little while and tries again.
