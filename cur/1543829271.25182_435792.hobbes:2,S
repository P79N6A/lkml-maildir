hi Andrew,
heres that pile of tiny patches..
It seems that a lot of the externs you noted were fixed in subsequent 
patches.
The other fixups should work for your 'insertion sort'.
Sorry about these faux-pas, I'll do better next time.
They apply cleanly on mm1, and build fine.
Sadly, I cant boot -mm1 ATM  (some nfsroot prob I'll try to dig into RSN),
so I tested against 17, theyre fine there.
