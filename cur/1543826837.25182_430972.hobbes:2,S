The spinlock is unneeded here.
What does all the code in this file do, anyway?  It looks totally generic
(and hence inappropriate for drivers/infiniband/hw/amso1100/) and somewhat
similar to idr trees, perhaps.

This _will_ happen under load.  What will the result of that be, in the
context of thise driver?
This function is incorrectly designed - it should receive a gfp_t argument.
Because you don't *know* that the caller will always hold a spinlock.  And
GFP_KERNEL is far, far stronger than GFP_ATOMIC.

Why is __GFP_DMA in there?  Unless you've cornered the ISA bus infiniband
market, it's likely to be wrong.
