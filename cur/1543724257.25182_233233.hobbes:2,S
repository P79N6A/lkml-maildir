Is really neccesary to use a X server? Why not just modify the init scripts to
use fbi to show a image? Is not that the kernel takes a lot of time to boot and
run init - even windows XP shows an ascii bar while it loads their kernel,
that period of time doesn't takes too much time and it doesn't annoy anyone.
You could switch off the printk output too, so the users doesn't see any
kernel message at all while init runs and the scripts puts the image in the
framebuffer console.
