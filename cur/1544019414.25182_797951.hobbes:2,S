Ah, that comment was more about that specific include in that specific
file - I couldn't see anything in there which required it.
The general rule is: if both asm/xxx.h and linux/xxx.h exists, then use
the linux/xxx.h version.  I stress _general_ rule - there are exceptions.
For example, linux/irq.h and linux/memory.h.  A clue would be if linux/xxx.h
doesn't include asm/xxx.h, then the rule above probably doesn't apply.

Much better, thanks.  This I'm happy with.
