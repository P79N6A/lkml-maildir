What it specifically does is it generates a delay which is proportional 
to the ISA/LPC clock.

Perhaps you do, but it's the de facto standard on the platform.  Every 
BIOS uses the same technique, because it works.
*Now*, the real question is how many drivers actually need these delays. 
  My guess is most don't at all.
