When trying to do a shutdown or reboot while an Ethernet card is present,
2.6.0-test5 continues to have problems which earlier 2.6.0-test versions
had, which can be solved by booting 2.4.19.
Shutdown messages appear on the text console as follows:
[...]
Shutting down PCMCIA unregister_netdevice: waiting for eth0 to become free.
Usage count = 1
unregister_netdevice: waiting for eth0 to become free. Usage count = 1
unregister_netdevice: waiting for eth0 to become free. Usage count = 1
unregister_netdevice: waiting for eth0 to become free. Usage count = 1
unregister_netdevice: waiting for eth0 to become free. Usage count = 1
unregister_netdevice: waiting for eth0 to become free. Usage count = 1
unregister_netdevice: waiting for eth0 to become free. Usage count = 1
unregister_netdevice: waiting for eth0 to become free. Usage count = 1
unregister_netdevice: waiting for eth0 to become free. Usage count = 1
[...]
The only way to shut down at this point is to turn off the power.
An alternative workaround is to manually type "ifconfig eth0 down" before
trying to shut down or reboot.  This takes a certain amount of activation of
human memory at the moment just before shutting down, and I have not been up
to the task.  Since this step was not necessary under 2.4.19, it is easier
to boot 2.4.19 instead.
Command "/etc/rc.d/pcmcia restart" suffers the same as a shutdown or reboot.
Again similarly, in 2.4.19 it works.
