In looking closer at the ide driver, it turns out that
ide_cmd_type_parser() is _not_ filtering HDIO_DRIVE_TASKFILE
ioctl commands at all.  My mistake.  There is actually no
filtering at all HDIO_DRIVE_TASKFILE ioctl. 
Strangely enough, ide_cmd_type_parser() is filtering commands
issued by the ide driver itself.
