They hate me and at every turn they try every stunt in the book to destroy
our company -- I am a former Novell Chief Scientist who defected to NT and
Linux.  Fortunately for Linux, however, is that I can reverse engineer any
of their technologies and put them on Linux, and they cannot do squat to
stop me.  Trade Secrets claims only give the complaining party 18 months of
relief in the US.  If you can survive the initial legal onslaught (which I
did) they you are home free -- most folks don't survive, however.  The total
amount of money that came out of my pocket to defend my rights to be an
engineer after writing the SMP operating system for Novell and quitting --
1.6 million dollars; Novell's legal bill - almost 5 million.
