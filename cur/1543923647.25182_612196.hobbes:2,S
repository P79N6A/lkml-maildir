Matheiu had a whole series of cmpxchg_local patches. Ccing him too. I 
think he has some numbers for other architectures.

Right.

That depends on the efficiency of a cmpxchg_local vs. the interrupt 
enable/ disable sequence on a particular arch. On x86 this yields about 
50% so it doubles the speed of the fastpath. On other architectures the 
cmpxchg is so slow that it is not worth it (ia64 f.e.)
