It look like Mike just built a series of kernels and had a problem,
which should preclude a tool change.
That said.  Does this feature of crash work in 2.6.29?  If not is
there enough interest to track this down, and fix it if it is a kernel
bug?
If we are going to be using these tools we need them working on the
latest and greatest kernels, not some weird enterprise branch, for
fuddy duddies.
