Incorrect, just look in the latest upstream kernel.

That's the problem.

libata-scsi.c is the SAT translation layer.

That's something that needs fixing, for SAS.

Because it has the problems listed time and again.

The SAS transport class is designed to support both firmware-based 
devices like MPT, and non-firmware devices such as Adaptec.
Sure it might need patches -- send patches, work with people, rather 
than ignoring existing work.

We've been over the technical stuff time and again.  That's the 
maintainer problem.  We need someone who will listen to the community.

It means not taking feedback, and working around rather than with the 
SCSI core.

Then you don't understand the ->qc_{prep,issue} hooks.  That should get 
you 90% of the way there, if not 99%.

Re-read libata-scsi.c, and submit any patches you feel are needed.

That's one of the problems: It should update the SCSI core.
