We will look into doing this.

Yes:
---
int ecryptfs_read_xattr_region(char *page_virt, struct dentry*ecryptfs_dentry)
{
	ssize_t size;
	int rc = 0;
	size = ecryptfs_getxattr(ecryptfs_dentry, ECRYPTFS_XATTR_NAME,
				 page_virt, ECRYPTFS_DEFAULT_EXTENT_SIZE);
---
That winds up calling the lower filesystem's getxattr with
ECRYPTFS_DEFAULT_EXTENT_SIZE as the size parameter. eCryptfs validates
this value against PAGE_CACHE_SIZE in main.c::ecryptfs_init().

We will work on some patches to address these issues.
