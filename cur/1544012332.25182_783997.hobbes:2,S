Subject: [PATCH 23/35] ocfs2: Another hamming code optimization.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Joel Becker <joel.becker@oracle.com>
In the calc_code_bit() function, we must find all powers of two beneath
the code bit number, *after* it's shifted by those powers of two.  This
requires a loop to see where it ends up.
We can optimize it by starting at its most significant bit.  This shaves
32% off the time, for a total of 67.6% shaved off of the original, naive
implementation.
