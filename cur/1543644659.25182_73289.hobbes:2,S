Is it possible to build a struct page *page, where
page_address(page) == some virtual address (not high mem of course)?
The reason I want to do this is so that I can pass it to
generic_make_request(), having only a pointer to a buffer
and size to a buffer, and the fact that not all devices
have request_fn() exposed (e.g. md).
Apparently I cannot just set b_data and b_size, b_page
also has to be set and it also seems that it will
not work if page_address(b_page) != b_data...
Thanks,
