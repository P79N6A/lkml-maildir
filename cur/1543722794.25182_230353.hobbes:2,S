After some further tests I am not sure anymore about this. I did a 
recompile of xine-lib using staircase 7.3. At first everything seems to 
be normal, but nearly at the end of the compile, the system started to 
get into this blocking state:
I wnated to start a kedit and a konsole, but it took forever. Only afer 
the compile was done and the package actually gets emerge, both windows 
showed up. Hmmm, so I revert to staircase 7.1 and check it out...
