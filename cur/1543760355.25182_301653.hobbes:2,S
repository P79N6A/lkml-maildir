For keeping track on the "originating ip address of the
task/process" (the ipv4 address of the user that started the
task/process).
It adds an ipaddr entry if available for each /proc/<pid> entry, among
the API changes.
Example:
root@dg:/usr/src# cat /proc/5907/ipaddr
192.128.102.93

The patch has nothing to do with this, as it's objective is different.
See

 and

if you want useful and real examples on how it works and helps.
