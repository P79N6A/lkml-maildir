I'm surprized, because I think you have a precedence problem here. Your 'if'
condition will be true if either :
  CONFIG_CRC32 = m
or
  CONFIG_CRC32 = y and CONFIG_FW_LOADER = m
or
  CONFIG_FW_LOADER = y and CONFIG_HOTPLUG = y and CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL = y
Anyway, I believe that you have no other choice due to the way dep_tristate
works. What would you expect it to do when it depends on 3 variables which
are respectively 'n', 'm' and 'y' ? Honnestly, without looking closer at its
implementation, I would not be able to give a valid response.
BTW, have you tried defining a temporary variable somewhere ? There are
portions of config where you see things such as :
if [ CONFIG_XX = "y" -o CONFIG_YY = "m" -a CONFIG_ZZ = "y" ]; then
   TEMP=y
fi
dep_tristate "cool feature" CONFIG_COOL $TEMP
Perhaps it could help you define complex combinations.
Regards,
Willy
