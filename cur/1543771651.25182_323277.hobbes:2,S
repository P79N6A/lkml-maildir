what do you mean by extreme load. Extreme number of RT tasks, or extreme 
number of tasks altogether? The sorted-list implementation i had in -RT 
had all non-RT tasks handled in an O(1) way - the O(N) component was for 
adding RT tasks (removal was O(1)).
so the question is - can we have an extreme (larger than 140) number of 
RT tasks? If yes, why are they all RT - they can have no expectation of 
good latencies with a possible load factor of 140!
