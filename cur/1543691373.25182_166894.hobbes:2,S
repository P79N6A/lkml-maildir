Indeed, it's working beautifully.

I found the problem.  The meaning of the option "number of supported
CPUs" is not what is expected.  It is not fixing the maximum number of
CPUs, but the number of the last CPU checked for.  Specifically, in
our system the CPUs are numbered 0 and 6.  Setting the MNCPU to 2
prevents the second CPU to be taken into account.
  OG.
