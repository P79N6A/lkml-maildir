    I seriously doubt that people really care _that_ much about a

    the precision. People who do care can fall back to gettimeofday()
    and try to correct for it that way.
In that case define the time to be approximate and nothing more.
The reason for the original suggestion was it seem feasible in the
future the syscall could be used for other purposes (multimedia
synchornisation) *and* be of value if made more precise without adding
yet another syscall at a later stage to do just this.
