No way. Their situation is just different from yours.
Some people have existing software. They want to port it with
minimal effort, since CPU time is cheaper than BRAIN time.
Some people want to prototype on normal clusters, then run the
code on fancy hardware. If message passing is slower on the
fancy hardware, then prototyping with messages is stupid.

The world is not only clusters and SMP.
Even if it was, you could prototype on a cheap cluster before you
buy the 8-way SMP Alpha that you need for regular use.

It all depends on how you define "shared" and "network" I suppose,
but I'm certainly not using SMP hardware or TCP/IP. I can define
physical address spaces that, when accessed, cause automatic data
movement with hardware routing at hundreds of megabytes/second.
(note BYTES not BITS) I think DSM would be perfect here.
This kind of hardware doesn't come cheap. You could save a huge
amount of money by doing development on a cluster, but you'd need
DSM to be able to run your code.
Going the other way, code written for the fancy hardware could
be grabbed for less demanding needs on a cluster. Maybe you will
need switches instead of dumb hubs... oh well, that is likely less
costly than a software rewrite.
Try to remember that not everyone has your hardware and needs.
I've looked at the Linux DSM code, so I know you won't be hurt
by it being in the kernel.
