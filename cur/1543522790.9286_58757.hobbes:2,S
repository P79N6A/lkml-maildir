Hi,
        I've been trying to setup an old 486 as a
mailserver/firewall/etc. for
this house however there is a problem. The first machine that I tried
had a problem with the memory and so it caused sig 11s/sig 7s. I swapped
that machine for an other machine and, after I added another 4mb 72 pin
fp simm today to it's existing 4mb, it had enough memory to run the
installer from several of the mainstream distros.
I tried several distro install disc, however the kernel used by each one
just causes a mess.
I also tried an old slackware '96 installation boot/root disk (kernel
2.0.0 - I think)  and, after it started uncompressing the image on the
root disc it said:
Unknown Interrupt.
Here is some of the output from the rh6.1 install disk (one of the 2.2.x
kernels - I forget which one). Note that the machine was absolutely dead
(no magic keys, sysrq, etc.) and that I had to hand-transcribe this
output. I couldn't get all of the display because it scrolled and I may
have made mistakes so if it doesn't make sense it's probably because I
was trying to read this from a very very bad old monitor/etc.
Here's the screen output that I got:
       00000000 c017ae5d c027e008 c0099008 00000009 00000006 00000005

Can someone help as I don't want to have to throw this machine away.
P.S. It used to have windows on it before I got it and it will load that
successfully (win95) - I realise that Linux is more demanding, however,
I think the underlying hardware is functioning properly.
