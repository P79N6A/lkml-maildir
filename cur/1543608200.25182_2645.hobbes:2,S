I am quite interested in the problems that arise with the xircom
cardbus ethernet cards, since I have difficulties with them as well.
However, my problems are not solved by setting promisc mode.
When I try to transmit larger amounts of data (such as scp'ing a 30 MB
file over from a different machine on the LAN), network transfer
stalls. I can abort the user space program, but the network link is
gone. This can be reproduced with:
- kernel 2.4.13, using pcmcia-cs drivers 3.1.25
- kernel 2.4.13, using pcmcia-cs drivers 3.1.29
- kernel 2.4.13, using kernel driver xircom_tulip_cb
- kernel 2.4.13-ac5, using kernel driver xircom_tulip_cb
- kernel 2.4.13-ac5, using kernel driver xircom_cb
I am using Debian/GNU Linux unstable/sid.
I tried this with two different RealPort 2 CardBus Ethernet R2BE100,
and an older RealPort CardBus Ethernet RBE100. I am currently in no
position of trying a different notebook, since the machine in question
(a Maxdata Artist Eton Pro from 1999, most probably a chicony OEM
product) is the only CardBus-able Linux notebook around. All three
Xircom Cards work fine with Windows 98 on that box, and an even older
16 bit Xircom RealPort card works fine with Linux.
Is it possible that I am doing something wrong?
2.4.13-ac5 has the patched xircom_tulip_cb from 2.4.13-pre3?
Any hints will be appreciated.
Greetings
Marc
