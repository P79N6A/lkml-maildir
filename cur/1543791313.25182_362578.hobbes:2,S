This is just going around in circles. Even with your fragmentation
avoidance and memory defragmentation, there are still going to be
cases where memory does get fragmented and can't be defragmented.
This is Ingo's point, I believe.
Isn't the solution for your hypervisor problem to dish out pages of
the same size that are used by the virtual machines. Doesn't this
provide you with a nice, 100% solution that doesn't add complexity
where it isn't needed?
