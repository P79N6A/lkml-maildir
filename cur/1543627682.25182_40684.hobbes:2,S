i want to move tcp/ip stack(including routing and
netfilter) to userspace, my goal is to trace all the
instructions involved in a firewall and router since i
don't know how to trace these instructions inside the
kernel. i want to get something like:
incoming ip packets(a file)-->fake ISR-->tcp/ip
stack-->outgoing ip packets( to /dev/null).
my question is: is it possible and relatively easy to
move tcp/ip stack to user space?
thanks for help.
