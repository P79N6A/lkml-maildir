(Note: I consider it blatantly incorrect to send a reply both to a
mailing list and directly to the address of someone who is subscribed to
that list unless you have reason to believe that that someone will not
see the message otherwise, but in this case I am doing so anyway because
I see no way to avoid it and still make sure all relevant people receive
the message.)

I have now tried all three of these, with no apparent effect; the USB
drive is still not detected when plugged in after boot. A naive search
on Google provides no indication of other possible parameters to try;
the only list I have found of ACPI-related kernel parameters includes no
others which seem likely to be helpful without more knowledge of the
specifics of the situation (and the subsystem) than I have.
What would the next step be?
