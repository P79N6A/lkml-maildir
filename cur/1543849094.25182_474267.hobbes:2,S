Ah, it is probably exercising the -EFAULT path, and the code in
Andrew's tree goes into an infinite loop I think.
We can't test for a fault off the atomic copy, because that needn't
indicate an unmapped area. What we need to do is change
fault_in_pages_readable to return ret, and catch and return that
in the caller if it is an error.
My usual workstation is down ATM otherwise I would send you a patch.
Unless someone beats me to it, I'll send you one tomorrow.
Thanks,
Nick
