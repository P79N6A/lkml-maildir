I must have misunderstood the data from the first email.  I was under 
the impression that it was much smaller than that number.

Mala's main complaint about readprofile is that it cannot profile 
while interrupts are disabled.  oprofile's timer interrupts cannot be 
disabled, they _always_ occur.

I look forward to seeing it.

Mala's main complaint about readprofile is that it cannot profile 
while interrupts are disabled.  I didn't see the case where it was 
being called with interrupts disabled.  I was hoping that you could 
point it out to me.
