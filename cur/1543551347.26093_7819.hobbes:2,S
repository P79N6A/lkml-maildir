Using PCI DMA is also generally broken for modular IDE. Unloading/reloading
the ide-probe-mod module still causes an oops when accessing disks
(NULL pointer dereference / Aiee, killing the interrupt handler / Panic)
and you are left with a dead system :(
I observe it with  alim15xx, but probably problem is more general and
appears somewhere in IDE initialization by ide-probe-mod (IMHO).
I observe similar (but not exactly the same) problem in 2.2.17+ide.
I think that getting rid of the ide-probe-mod module (and linking it into
ide-mod) should solve the problem. 
What do you think of it Andre ?
