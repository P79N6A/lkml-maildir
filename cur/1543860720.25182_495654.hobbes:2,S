Certainly, but tar isn't going to remember all the inode numbers.
Even if you solve the storage requirements (not impossible) it would
have to do (4e9^2)/2=8e18 comparisons, which computers don't have
enough CPU power just yet.
It doesn't matter if there are collisions within the filesystem, as
long as there are no collisions between the set of files an
application is working on at the same time.
