Hi...
Yesterday, I just wanted to download some pics from a Smartmedia card
from my camera.  I put the card into the reader (USB Mass Storage Flash
Card Reader, Manufacturer: EZ, Serial Number: 9876543210ABCDEF, driver
is usb-storage and working well now, I had problems earlier), but the
kernel doesn't recognize FAT filesystem on the card...
Oct 23 17:19:45 moria kernel: VFS: Can't find a valid FAT filesystem on dev sda1.
Oct 23 17:28:20 moria kernel: VFS: Can't find a valid FAT filesystem on dev loop0.
The second line was, I dd-ed the card onto a disk file and tried to
mount that... no luck.
More messages:
Oct 23 17:19:01 moria kernel: FAT: invalid first entry of FAT (0xff8 != 0x0)
Luckily, I have a 2.4 machine around, I tried to mount the resulting
disk image (NFS) on that machine (-o loop ofcourse), and it worked
perfectly... kernel is 2.4.22.
On 2.6 machine, modules loaded were fat and vfat... fstab entry in
question is:
/dev/sda1          /mnt/sm      vfat        user,noauto,owner,rw   1 1
And yes, I tried mounting the filesystem in question as fat _and_
vfat... nothing works.
Not that I need FAT filesystems so very much, but I need them here and
there, and it would be a very NOT nice thing not to have drivers working
:(
Any ideas what's wrong?
