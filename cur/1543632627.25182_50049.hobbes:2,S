I think it would be better to wait until Zwane sends something to Alan
and/or Marcelo, as this patch is incorrect on a couple of levels.  See my

This is wrong, it was:
+               if (!dev->ro) {
in Gerald's original patch, and that actually made sense.

This line should really be below the following if statement, as I believe
Zwane mentioned to Gerald.

I think always blindly remapping the the DMA channels to 0 and 1 is a bad
idea and will likely break things for some people.  It would be better if
the core isapnp code could be made smarter, but a simple alternative would
be to rework the opl3sa2 module parameter parsing to allow using the DMA
parameters as an override when using PnP.

PS: Zwane, any chance you want to update MAINTAINERS to "officially" take
    over opl3sa2?
