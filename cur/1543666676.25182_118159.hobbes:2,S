Thanks to Niels Bakker I can report that stock Linux 2.5.65 can talk IP6SEC
with FreeBSD 4.7-STABLE (KAME 20010528/FreeBSD). It worked on the first try.
This using ipsec-tools-0.2.2 and manual keying. Racoon is reported not to
listen on IPv6 sockets yet, but we didn't try this.
The configuration used is that described in
http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.ipsec.html
 'Intro with Manual Keying', with
IPv4 addresses replaced by IPv6 addresses.
Thanks for making this possible!
Regards,
Bert
