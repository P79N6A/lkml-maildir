Well, I'm still not sure your patch is better. I've seen it and it is
much more complicated. _If_ we want to support multiple different CAPS
notes with different versions simultaneously, _then_ your patch is the
way to go.I'm just not sure having multiple CAPS notes is good idea:
it makes kernel code more complicated, it is hard to imagine interface
to manipulate such multiple capabilities, and I do not think it is
neccessary at all. [You want single capabilities per executable, not
arbitrary number of capabilities.  The later is too hard to use for
use and unneccessary, IMO.]
