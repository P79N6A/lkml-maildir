I am using the YMFPCI driver on a Toshiba Tecra 8100.
The sound_alloc_dmap() function in dmabuf.c must be changed from using 
__get_free_pages() and virt_to_bus() -> pci_alloc_consistent().
This looked like an easy thing to do, but the only parameter to 
sound_alloc_dmap() is of type struct dma_buffparms -- whose definition I 
couldn't even find -- and pci_alloc_consistent() expects a struct 
pci_dev as a parameter.  I read the driver-model.txt file in the 
Documentation in the hopes of finding some magic __get_pci_dev_by_id(int 
  dev) function, but things are never that easy :).
I tried asking about this in kernelnewbies, but got no response. Anyone 
here want to give me a nudge in the right direction?
