Has there been any progress on fixing this yet?
I've studied the relevant futex code (handle_futex_death()
and asm-${arch}/futex.h), and it seems that many archs
are seriously broken now, not just arm. Any arch that wires
up the set_robust_list() syscall while implementing its
asm-${arch}/futex.h by including asm-generic/futex.h allows
its kernels to be hung by unprivileged user-space code.
My concern is arm, but it seems alpha, avr32, h8300, m68k,
m68knommu, and sh64 are also affected by this bug.
