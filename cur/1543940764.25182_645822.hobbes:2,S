If the UART isn't open, its DMA should be inactive.  :)
Also, after suspend() it should normally be inactive.
(That latter is somewhat platform-specific.)

Wouldn't that just be a variant of "Frozen"?  The clock API should
be fully capable of disabling unused clocks, PLLs, and oscillators
when the platform supports it.  It's common for lots of clocks to be
disable even in non-suspended system states.

The sysfs wakeup attributes are the runtiime config mechanism for all
events associated with a single device.
