Sounds like a blocked signal.

It does - it clobbers errno :-)
My suggestions: use sigaction with defined restart/mask/etc behaviour
instead of signal.  Save and restore errno in the signal handler.
Make sure SIGCHLD isn't blocked.
But if your only interest is to get rid of the zombies, the most simple
solution would be to set SIGCHLD to ignore.
