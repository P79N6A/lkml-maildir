Both the kernel and ksymoops have to guess at what *might* be a return
address when dumping the stack.  The kernel prints any addresses that
even look as if they fall within kernel or module space.  ksymoops
takes those addresses and finds the nearest external symbol.
If you browse vmlinux and look for the text of timer_bug_msg, you will
find it in read only storage.  Either side of timer_bug_msg are a lot
more text strings but, because these strings come from printk formats
and string assignments, they are not declared as external symbols.
Therefore there are gaps in the System.map, as you found above.
It is left for a sensible human to decide if the stack trace and
mapping to external symbols is sensible.  IMHO it is better for the
kernel and ksymoops to provide as much info as possible, even if some
of it might be a little misleading.
