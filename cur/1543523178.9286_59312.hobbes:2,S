Correct, but adding more and more methods... If anything, we might be
better off with callback _passed_ _to_ ->read() and ->write(). _That_
would make a lot of sense, simply because we could (a) do read/write from
kernel space without set_fs() trickery; (b) do analogs of sendfile() right
way; (c) yes, kill special case for sockets; (d) hopefully solve your
problem. Normal sys_read() and sys_write() would pass copy_to_user() /
copy_from_user() here. For sys_readv() and sys_writev() - well,
corresponding function that would copy to/from iovector. IIRC we have
something like that either in net/core/* or in net/socket.c...
Linus, remember the patch splitting write_one_page() in two parts? That
would make the thing very natural for regular files too - we would just
call that callback from generic_file_write(). And reading side already has
such callback...
