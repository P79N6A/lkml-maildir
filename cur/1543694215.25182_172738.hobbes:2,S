Well, I don't use the IEEE1394 drivers (yet), so like I said, it's non-fatal. Are
there any other debugging options I can enable that would help pinpoint this
(i.e frame pointers?)
Interesting part of .config:
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_IOVIRT=y
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP=y
CONFIG_X86_EXTRA_IRQS=y
CONFIG_X86_FIND_SMP_CONFIG=y
CONFIG_X86_MPPARSE=y
