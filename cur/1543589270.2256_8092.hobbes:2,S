Well, for all those people getting "audio drain" messages
when trying to play audio with your via82cxxx driver try
passing the "noapic" option to your kernel on bootup to
see if it works.  
I did manage to get mine to work, but only with xmms.  When I
try to use other programs, like mplayer or mtv, I get these kernel
messages

The audio ends up playing very very fast... its pretty funny, but
not very useful :)  Programs like mpg123 still wont play anything
(i assume due to the rate locked codec).  Oh, and I cant get the
mixer to work... with any program.  Its like it isnt there.
thnx in adv
