Subject: [PATCH 7/7] pool: Improve memory usage for devices which can't cross boundaries
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/4/314

The previous implementation simply refused to allocate more than a
boundary's worth of data from an entire page.  Some users didn't know
this, so specified things like SMP_CACHE_BYTES, not realising the
horrible waste of memory that this was.  It's fairly easy to correct
this problem, just by ensuring we don't cross a boundary within a page.
This even helps drivers like EHCI (which can't cross a 4k boundary)
on machines with larger page sizes.
