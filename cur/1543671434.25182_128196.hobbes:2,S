Very few companies win by being the leader. You win by letting someone
else create the market then jumping on them with lots of money, sharp
marketing and business sense.

Lots of Linux stuff is new and unique - from doing threading right to 
stuff like IP Masquerading, to the Glibc extensions to make
internationalisation actually sane.

Like the patent office head who proposed closing it because nothing was
left to invent

Your economic model is flawed because if something needs doing enough
someone will pay to do it. The moment the value exceeds the cost it
should happen. Government keeps raising the cost of doing anything but
sitting at home watching TV but even with that factor included people
will pay the cost when it is needed. 
Its also not clear that open source companies will replicate everything
or have the ability to do so. Even without US patent bogons its doubtful
that open source is going to replace Oracle in a hurry. It takes time
for stuff to become commodity. 
As to using one companies lessons to do your work, how much did BK learn
from what *didn't* work well in Clearcase. Rather a lot I believe. That
learning fuels innovation.
