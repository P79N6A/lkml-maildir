I am thinking about the bigger picture:  You are unloading a driver,
then continuing to use the hardware.  To me, that is an undefined state.

Oh, the horror!
[jgarzik@rum linux_2_4]$ ls -l drivers/sound/via82cxxx_audio.o
-rw-r--r--    1 jgarzik  jgarzik     27968 Nov  6 03:28
drivers/sound/via82cxxx_audio.o
So you would rather load everybody's kernel down with mixer level /
module persistence gunk... than simply load a kernel module at boot, and
leave it alone?

The one thing that you and I agree on:  It would be nice if the driver
did not init the mixer to a set of defaults, when a preferred set is
available.
However, since simply leaving the driver loaded solves all this mess, it
doesn't seem worth changing drivers to do anything different.
