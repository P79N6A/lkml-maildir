hi,
	I've been working on a device driver (amcc s5933 based) and
it's working ok, but now the rest of the modules in the system give
an error on bootup. The message is something like : modprode: can't
find dependencies for module xxxxx.
I've been playing with this driver for a while, but I recently upgraded to
RH5.2. The problem occurs with both 2.2.0pre5 and 2.0.36, so I'm sure
it's not kernel related.
The other thing is a file called /lib/modules/(kernel version)/modules.dep
is created (and re-created if I delete it), but it has tomorrows date.
Does anyone have any idea what I messed up to cause this, and is there
an easy way to fix it (apart from re-install).
thanks
Greg Smart
