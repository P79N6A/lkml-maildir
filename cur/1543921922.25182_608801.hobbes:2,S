The number of objects per page is reduced by enabling full debugging. That 
triggers a potential of more order 1 allocations but we are failing at 
order 0 allocs. slub_debug=F does not increase object size with debugging 
information but keeps things as they are while doing as much verification 
of slab integrity as possible.
One--potentially far fetched theory--is that the difference in alloc 
performance may trigger a race. But I guess it is more likely that we will 
find something wrong with the gfp flags (that I recategorized for 2.6.24).
