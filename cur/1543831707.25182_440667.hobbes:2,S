Peter,
Explain what you are thinking here.  What I proposed, I have already 
implemented in NetWare, it's very easy to do.  Snapshotting is not 
complex for FS's but does require a lot of space for meta-data to manage 
it.  EXT is not architecteced for something this complex.  A simple 
hidden mv is much easier to do.
