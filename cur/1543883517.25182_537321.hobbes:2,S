Reporters are just humans too and if they have no incentive to
post bugs they won't. So it's a lose/lose situation, really.
With a group of people working together they should try to
motivate each other, not demoralize everyone.
(I know, each bug report is a pain, voicing someone's failure.
So ignoring it might make people feel better, but it doesn't
fix anything.)

True. There's also a difference between a bad bug report and
one that a specific developer won't handle. In the former case
anyone could recognize it and tell the reporter about it. The
latter is a bit trickier, but if the developer thinks about
looking at it later, he better can tell the reporter just that.
A short "I'll take a look at it, later, when I've more time."
is so much better than plain silence.

I wouldn't be so sure about that. What's worse, why would the
reporter bother telling that the bug is fixed in version N+1?
No one cared about it anyway, so there's no one to tell it to.
That would explain a lot open bugs too.
