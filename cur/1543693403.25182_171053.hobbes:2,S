Actually, most fairly complicated contracts (more than just 2-3 clauses) have a
separability clause because if you don't, then the whole contract DOES go poof
if you have an unenforceable clause - so without one, the license goes away,
revoking itself.
And sure enough, section 7 has:
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances
