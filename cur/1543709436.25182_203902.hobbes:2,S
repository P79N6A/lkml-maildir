    The MCE stuff truly did find a hardware fault early for me; my
Athlon system was MCE'ing and I ignored it, and later I got sig11
errors and fs corruption, which I finally traced to a failing stick
of memory.

    I wouldn't be so quick to write off MCEs as bugs or errata,
especially if the exceptions have only just begun showing up.
Running CPUBurn, memtest86 and the like is still probably a good
idea, especially if you value the data on your file system.
