The problem is a little stranger than that.  On my system, cardmgr only 
"believes" a card is inserted twice if a card is in the pccard slot when 
  cardmgr is intially run.  Otherwise, cardmgr and the drivers appear to 
function correctly.  Josh, can you try this?
I posted a message about this earlier, but I didn't receive a response 
so I still don't understand what's going on.

If you need any more information, please let me know.
