Actually, it is easy for the driver authors to do this right now.  They can
just make the .suspend() routine always return an error.
Well, I think this is a good idea: if the device in question requires specific
power management during the suspend/resume, but it is not implemented by the
driver, we should require the author of the driver to define the .suspend()
routine that returns -ENOSYS (preferably, with an explanatory warning in
dmesg).
Thoughts?

The problem is we have to review quite a lot of drivers for this purpose.
Still it looks like we should do this anyway.
Greetings,
