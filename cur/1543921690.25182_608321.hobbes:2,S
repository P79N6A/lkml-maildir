I have a device that supports MSI and INTX-disable, and, with MSI on (and 
delivering interrupts successfully) also sends legacy interrupts (on 
the IRQ that is no longer associated with the device) unless INTX is 
disabled. Without the intx_disable(), the kernel disables the IRQ 
entirely and breaks a random other device in my system.
It's:
00:07.0 Bridge: nVidia Corporation MCP61 Ethernet (rev a2)
I haven't tried MSI with the other devices in the system, but I expect 
that this:
00:05.0 Audio device: nVidia Corporation MCP61 High Definition Audio (rev a2)
will have the same issue, and use a multi-vendor driver.

It's likewise documented (although maybe arguable in wording) that the 
device shouldn't send legacy interrupts if MSI is in use, regardless of 
INTX_DISABLE, but this also happens in the field.
I think that the current Linux behavior with respect to INTX_DISABLE is 
simply due to which hardware bug was present in the device whose driver 
first got Linux support, but one or the other or both needs a quirk, since 
there's no behavior that works with everything. And it's still impossible 
to tell which bug is more common, since MSI isn't used most of the time, 
even if the hardware supports it, so it's pretty arbitrary which way Linux 
goes in the non-quirk case.
