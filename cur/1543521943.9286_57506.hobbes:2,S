You may be in a place where you can sleep but you can't do I/O to avoid
deadlocking and so you shouldn't use __GFP_IO and nothing more (it has
nothing to do with __GFP_WAIT).
But if it can sleep and there aren't deadlock conditons going on and it
doesn't use __GFP_WAIT, it means it's buggy and has to be fixed.
I have not read the rest and the patch yet (I'll continue ASAP).
