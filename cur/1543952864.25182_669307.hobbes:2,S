If yes, then I got the crash by using hidp over l2cap with non-hid device 
(session->input). I'm not sure if it was connected at all and even if hidd was 
running (I tested moving with mouse by cellphone with switching on and off the 
daemon, since it needed some little changes).
If you, hci fellows, are interested I might send more detailed description of 
the crash tomorrow.
