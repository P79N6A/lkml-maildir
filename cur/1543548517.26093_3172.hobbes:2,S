Subject: Masking out one page of RAM because of bit-errors.

Dear list-readers,
I have a bad SDRAM chip with exactly one bit error. Memtest86 shows
that the bit error always occurs at the address 0x4eff508. I tried
to calculate the page number and it should be 20223.
I then looked at arch/i386/mm/init.c and found the function
"page_is_ram". I added a test which was something like this:
static inline int page_is_ram (unsigned long pagenr)
{
   int i;
   if (pagenr == 20223)
        return 0;
[rest of function snipped]
A also added a few printk's so I could verify that the page was
marked as reserved by the calling function.
But it does not work. I also tried 20222 and 20224 because I didn't
know if the first pagenr is 0 or 1. 
Could someone tell me if there's another way to mark this single page
as unusable ?
Thanks,
Patrick
