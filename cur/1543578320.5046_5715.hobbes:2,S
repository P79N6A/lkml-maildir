We don't.
But it does come up every once in a while, and it will probably continue
to do so.
I looked at it a year or two ago myself, and came to the conclusion that I
don't want to blow up our page table size by a factor of three or more, so
I'm not personally interested any more. Maybe somebody else comes up with
a better way to do it, or with a really compelling reason to.
"Feel free to try" is definitely the open source motto.
