When checkpointing it is important to preserve all state.  If you are
doing transparent highly available computing, you need to make sure all
system calls get the same answers in the clones.  So you would need to
virtualise the entropy pool.
There are likely to be dozens of other quite hard problems in the way
first.  Like I said, wishful thinking :-).
