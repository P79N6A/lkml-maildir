I haven't been able to build support for VFAT for some time because of
this function.  I've grepped my way through the kernel sources searching
for it without avail--it's defined extern in pagemap.h, but I can't
track it back further than that.
I try to read the kernel list but it's very hard to keep up.  I'm trying
to build 2.3.11, but it's been around since what appears to be a rewrite
of some of the mm code. . . .
If anyone who sees this would know what I've done to hide that function,
I'd sure be obliged. . . .
Thanks in advance.
