ext2 can still become corrupted and destroy /dev. i have seen this happen
several times (and looking through newsgroups etc, lots of other people
have also).

I am investigating devfs solutions that won't require a daemon of any
kind.

It does solve some existing problems though. It eases management (but does
not eliminate it) and current system is no better. devfs is surely not
worse management-wise.

Tell this to new linux users. "I have to do WHAT to use my new hardware?"
With devfs, these new devices come automagic with the kernel. It won't end
with usb...
