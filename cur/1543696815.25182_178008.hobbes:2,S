Bart (et al),
Here's a patch for ide-tape.c that gets ide-tape working on the 2.6 kernel.
This should be applied after your recent patch that fixed the rq->flags
stuff in ide-tape.
There's nothing in here that will make it more difficult to change the
rq->flags stuff later if necessary--this will just tweak a few things to get
the driver functional.
Most of this stuff is just stuff to get the Seagate STT3401A Travan tape
drive working, as I already submitted for the 2.4 kernel.
Thanks!
Stuart
(I'll resend this in just a moment as plain text--I have to do that from a
different email account.)
