Here is what I get on my dual 2.4GHz Opteron 250:
booted with idle=halt
$ pfmon --us-c -ecpu_clk_unhalted,interrupts_masked_cycles_with_interrupt_pending,interrupts_masked_cycles,cycles_no_fpu_ops_retired -k --system-wide -t 10
<session to end in 10 seconds>
CPU0                    11,356,210 CPU_CLK_UNHALTED                               
CPU0                             0 INTERRUPTS_MASKED_CYCLES_WITH_INTERRUPT_PENDING
CPU0                     3,836,107 INTERRUPTS_MASKED_CYCLES                       
CPU0                23,910,784,532 CYCLES_NO_FPU_OPS_RETIRED                      
CPU1                    19,303,632 CPU_CLK_UNHALTED                               
CPU1                             0 INTERRUPTS_MASKED_CYCLES_WITH_INTERRUPT_PENDING
CPU1                    13,942,265 INTERRUPTS_MASKED_CYCLES                       
CPU1                23,911,872,654 CYCLES_NO_FPU_OPS_RETIRED                      
As you can see, CYCLES_NO_FPU_OPS_RETIRED on each CPU is as expected  for 10s.
booted with idle=poll
$ pfmon --us-c -ecpu_clk_unhalted,interrupts_masked_cycles_with_interrupt_pending,interrupts_masked_cycles,cycles_no_fpu_ops_retired -k --system-wide -t 10
<session to end in 10 seconds>
CPU0                23,906,091,982 CPU_CLK_UNHALTED                               
CPU0                             0 INTERRUPTS_MASKED_CYCLES_WITH_INTERRUPT_PENDING
CPU0                     3,771,569 INTERRUPTS_MASKED_CYCLES                       
CPU0                23,906,090,750 CYCLES_NO_FPU_OPS_RETIRED                      
CPU1                23,906,629,241 CPU_CLK_UNHALTED                               
CPU1                             0 INTERRUPTS_MASKED_CYCLES_WITH_INTERRUPT_PENDING
CPU1                    14,805,078 INTERRUPTS_MASKED_CYCLES                       
CPU1                23,906,194,343 CYCLES_NO_FPU_OPS_RETIRED                      
CYCLES_NO_FPU_OPS_RETIRED is as expected and, in this case, it is equal to CPU_CLK_UNHALTED
because we are busy looping.
If I don't specify anything, I get like idle=halt which is expected.
