For memory (pfn_valid == 1) it would be more memory efficient to use a few bits
in struct page->flags
In general because there are lots of uses of "range lists" it would be better
to put it as a library into lib.
Coding style needs some work.
Too many printks.
I am not sure yet the cmaps don't need reference counting. For some
cases (user space support) they probably will.
Need user space support, e.g. using the existing ioctls for /proc/bus/pci/*
(they are currently not implemented on i386/x86-64 but should with this)
Then someone would need to change the X server to use this.
Needs testing on a lot of systems.
Need to figure out if CMAP_ALLOW_OVERLAPPING should be set or not.
Probably need to go over the combining rule etc. with a fine comb
