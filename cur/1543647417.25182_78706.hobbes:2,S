This is a somewhat painful issue. The negative effect of its absence on
UP is quite visible, but multiprogrammed streaming SMP workloads (i.e.
badari's 40 simultaneous dd's) appear to degrade severely in the
presence of the available drop behind implementations.
IIRC akpm suggested in response to the SEGQ/NRU patches that a method
of reducing the arrival rate to the relevant LRU locks for drop behind
would be required to remain performant on multiprogrammed streaming
workloads. This is not entirely simple as methods of deferred LRU list
manipulations are largely unclear, and Rik pointed out that marking the
affected pages for immediate deactivation on scanning like my attempt
at resolving this is a grossly ineffective method of actually
accomplishing drop behind.

This issue also arose in response to Rik's NRU/SEGQ patches.
Essentially his accounting was on a per-mm basis and I questioned
whether or not it should be done on a finer-grained level. No clear
response or confirming/conflicting opinion was ever posted.

The level of control you propose is clearly much stronger than
O_STREAMING. Unfortunately I'm not in a position to comment on the need
for or the usefulness of the interface.
