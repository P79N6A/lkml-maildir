Samba needs to be able to notify a client machine, when a file in a 
directory changes (i.e. is added/removed/modified/renamed). The directory 
to be watched is given by the client and can include subdirectories.
Right now Samba on Linux uses dnotify to watch the given directory
and just returns an error (too many files changed). The client has
to find out for itself which files changed.
This breaks certain user applications (e.g. IIS), because they rely
on getting the file names back from Samba.
I have a patch which makes a copy of all directory information on 
each dnotify event and looks for the changed files. This works but
obviously doesn't scale too well for many files in a directory.
