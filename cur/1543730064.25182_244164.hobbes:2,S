Hi, Pete.

Hi, Pete.
> 3) Interactivity performance when compiling a kernel (make rpm) sucks.  I have a Dell Poweredge 400SC, with a Hyper threaded P4/1GB of ram, ATI Radeon 9600 based video.  Load average jumps to the 4's, and stays there - while each cpu in the hyper thread shows about 50% idle time.  Mouse pointer jumps all over the place, mouse clicks are lost, menus are slow to drop down, etc..
Ingo found a ghastly performance problem with X, but that'll be present in
2.6.8.1 as well.
