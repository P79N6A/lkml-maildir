Alan, could you clarify for me? I'm the last guy to diddle with ewrk3 so
I'll track this down if there is indeed something to track down. ewrk3
has a private ioctl for setting the mac address. By the "up" method do
you mean the etherdev open method? Should there be a standard ioctl
implemented for setting the mac address?
