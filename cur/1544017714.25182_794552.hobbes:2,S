I wasn't actually looking at the cost of the checks, even though they do
look higher (if they are using CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK anyway).
The 2.6.24 code would trigger a rescheduling interrupt only when the
prio of the inbound task was higher than the running task.
This workload has a large number of equal priority rt tasks that are not
bound to a single CPU, and so I think it should trigger more
preempts/reschedules with the today's check_preempt_equal_prio().
