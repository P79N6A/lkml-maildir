I was using NFS with 2.0.0 - I guess there is no locking supported so I
probably don't need it. I am not sure though if e.g. mutt will do dot locking
if the functionality of fcntl is not available.

I never got such a message.
Anyway, I tried it before (therefore my posting was incomplete, sorry) but even
with nolock the program just sits there waiting for fcntl to return :(
Any other ideas?
