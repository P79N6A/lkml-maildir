With your tree I now have the problem that it doesn't even boot anymore.
The CHRP kernel which worked before stopped after "CHRP kernel
loader...", the elf-pmac one still crashes with:
Elf32 kernel loaded...
chrpboot starting: loaded at 0x01000000
heap at 0x00003000
gunzipping (0x00010000 <- 0x01006cf8:0x01155486)...
