That 142 would be what, a SHARC DSP system? It sure doesn't look
like Transmeta's Crueso. The best I found was 6 and 8 per 1U:
"RLX has managed to tuck 24 servers into a 3U enclosure" --> 8/U
"WebBunker units can hold 12 processors [in 2U]" --> 6/U
For PowerPC I found 32/U to 40/U, in increments of 9U.
See www.mc.com for an example. The processor gets you 4 (four!)
floating-point fused multiply-add operations per cycle, typically
at 400 MHz. Being optimistic, that's a teraflop in 9U.

Nope, plain old air or conduction.
If you're going to rant about off-topic junk, at least try to
throw in a few useful references so people can check facts and
maybe take advantage of whatever it is you're ranting about.
(yeah, yeah, sorry about the VGA console thing)
