Why will moving init smp_init help? Because as far as I can see
setup_per_cpu_areas() is called by  start_kernel. But it
is only defined for SMP so this should do it:
--- init/main.c Wed Apr 10 15:00:25 2002
+++ init/main.c_new     Mon Apr 22 15:33:45 2002

+static inline void setup_per_cpu_areas(void)
+{

 #endif
