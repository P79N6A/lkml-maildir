Subject: [PATCH 2/3] mmap: round mmap hint address above mmap_min_addr
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/16/276

If mmap_min_addr is set and a process attempts to mmap (not fixed) with
a non-null hint address less than mmap_min_addr the mapping will fail
the security checks.  Since this is just a hint address this patch will
round such a hint address above mmap_min_addr.
gcj was found to try to be very frugal with vm usage and give hint
addresses in the 8k-32k range.  Without this patch all such programs
failed and with the patch they happily get a higher address.
This patch is wrappad in CONFIG_SECURITY since mmap_min_addr doesn't
exist without it and there would be no security check possible no matter
what.  So we should not both compiling in this rounding if it is just a
waste of time.
