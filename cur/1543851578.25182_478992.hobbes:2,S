What is that method?
> * There is a rw semaphore that is locked for read for nearly all
Depending on the length of the critical section rw locks are often
not faster than non rw locks because the read case has to bounce
around the cache line of the lock anyways and they're actually
a little more expensive.

The second call should be a tail call, i.e. just a jump
The first call isn't needed on a non debug kernel, but doing the
two unconditional jumps should be basically free on a modern OOO CPU.
The actual implementation is spinlock based vs atomic based for i386.
This was because at some point nobody could benchmark a difference
between the two and the spinlock based version is much easier
to verify and to understand. If you can demonstrate a difference
that could be reevaluated.

In the last time we're going more for saved icache and better
use of branch predictors (who are more happy with less branch locations
to cache) I would expect the call/ret to be executed
mostly in parallel with the other code anyways.
