First of all, why do you need to intercept system calls like this from
the kernel?  Is this something that can't be done from user space using
ptrace?

The syscall code does not have the proper module locking needed for
calling syscalls in a module.  Nor do we want it.  That would just cause
slowdowns for all syscalls when 99.9% of them are built-in.  The oops
happens because some task is sleeping in your function and the module
gets unloaded from under it.  The moral of the story: don't muck with
sys_call_table.

At least in 2.4.0-test4, there are two select() syscalls: old_select and
sys_select.  I don't have a 2.2 kernel handy to verify if that version
has both, but it is a likely guess.
