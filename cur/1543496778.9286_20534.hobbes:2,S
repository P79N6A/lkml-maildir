Exactly.
The thing is, that the "obvious" implementation of a != comparison will
look something like
	cmp a,b
	jne same
	...
which on the face of it is perfect. However, in the presense of _other_
comparisons, it's suddenly not necessarily the best thing any more,
especially if there are combinations of these comparisons. Especially as
conditional branches are expensive, and what you _really_ want to happen
is something more like
	cmp a,b
	sete x
	cmp c,d
	sete y
	cmp e,f
	sete z
	and x,y
	and y,z
	je not_true
With combinations, using xor and other binary operations are often
advantageous exactly because the obvious implementation does _not_ imply a
compare and the status register, but instead implies a normal arithmetic
operation with the result in a general register - and suddenly the
compiler sees more options for combining such operations. 
Now, for a perfect compiler, none of these source modifications will make
any difference. In fact, at least for this case, anything newer than
gcc-2.6 will apparently generate the same thing in the end.

The compiler I have access to right now do not generate any different code
for != and ^, and I don't remember what the original code generation issue
was...
