No, it can't. There is not support at all for c++ in the kernel. Even if
you don't use exceptions and you redefine all new() operators, when you
try to load the module it will not find several symbols that are defined
inside user space libraries. Under 2.4 I managed to use c++ code in a
module, but I had to define some 100% bogus symbols in the sources to make
the loader happy (those symbols are gcc- and architecture-dependent).
Furthermore, c++ code can crash because c++ hides too many things,
expecially temporary stuff which is allocated on the stack. Stack space in
*very* limited in kernel space. Finally, linux 2.6 do not permit loading
c++ code anymore.
