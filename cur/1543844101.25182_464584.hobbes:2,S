Even that wouldn't be illegal.  No one ever said that any particular write 
becomes visible to all CPUs at the same time.

Yes, I think this must be right.  If a store is hung up in a CPU's store 
buffer, it will mask later stores by other CPUs (i.e., prevent them from 
becoming visible to the CPU that owns the store buffer).  Hence all stores 
that _do_ become visible will appear in a consistent order.
But my knowledge of outlandish hardware is extremely limited, so don't 
take my word as gospel.
