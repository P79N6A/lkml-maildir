It was posted a number of times to lkml in December, and it was
commented on by a few different people, and the patch went through a few
different revisions.  It also was in the -mm tree for awhile.

That's what the patch allows to happen.  I think it's the right
approach, what do you think it should do?

Hm, in sleeping on it, I think I'll leave it, as it's worked out just
fine for me for the past 2+ years I've been the PCI maintainer, this has
been the first it has come up.  But if it really annoys you, how about
just adding another L: entry for it, so people can choose where they
want to go?
Oh, and you forgot the Signed-off-by: line :)
