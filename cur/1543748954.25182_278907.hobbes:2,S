But if /etc can also be a file, cat would not complain!

Yes, indeed the idea itself is good. `ls` uses it to follow symlinks that 
point to directories:
ls -l /U
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 35 Dec  6 22:03 /U -> 
/media/usb-0000000000004287:0:0:0p
ls -l /U/
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root  48 Dec  6 14:27 .
drwxr-xr-x  31 root root 824 Dec 14 17:51 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 1614 Dec 12 23:57 tstpasswd

Well, and before ls is tweaked to do so?
