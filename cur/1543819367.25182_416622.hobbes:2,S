There are two problems.  First the scheduler probably doesn't account
for the reduced capacity of a CPU getting hammer with interrupts. Second,
it does make sense to balance different device's interrupts to different
CPU's. A longer term user mode IRQ balancer can make those decisions.
For the networking case, there is a real win if the application code runs
on the same CPU as the interrupt. Otherwise, you end up cache thrashing
control block structures and headers.
