A few different problems.  First, when I use my USB hub then I get this 
  drivers/usb/core/hub.c: new USB device 00:11.2-1, assigned address 2
  drivers/usb/core/hub.c: USB hub found at 1
  drivers/usb/core/hub.c: 9 ports detected
  drivers/usb/core/hub.c: new USB device 00:11.2-1.4, assigned address 3
  drivers/usb/core/hub.c: USB hub found at 1.4
  drivers/usb/core/hub.c: 3 ports detected
  drivers/usb/core/hub.c: new USB device 00:11.2-1.7, assigned address 4
  drivers/usb/core/hub.c: new USB device 00:11.2-1.8, assigned address 5
  drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: ctrl urb status -32 received
  drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: usb_submit_urb(ctrl) failed
and none of the USB devices show up at all.  But, when I plug the keyboard
and mouse in without the hub they work fine.
For background I'm using a MAC USB keyboard (w/passive hub) and a Logitech
Trackball plugged into the keyboard.  When I plug the keyboard into the 
computer then both work fine.  When I unplug them I get 
  drivers/usb/core/usb.c: USB disconnect on device 2
  drivers/usb/core/usb.c: USB disconnect on device 3
  drivers/usb/core/usb.c: USB disconnect on device 4
and subsequent plugins of the devices get 
  drivers/usb/core/hub.c: new USB device 00:11.2-1, assigned address 5
  drivers/usb/core/hub.c: new USB device 00:11.2-1, assigned address 6
but the devices never work.
Finally, I've noticed a few times that the mouse has taken a vacation - i.e.
I move it and nothing happens.  This goes on for about twenty seconds and then
all the movements in did in the interum start happening.  During this twenty
seconds my built-in PS/2 mouse works fine.  Oh, and I get no kernel output 
from any of this.
My config can be found here

Let me know if there's any other information I can provide
