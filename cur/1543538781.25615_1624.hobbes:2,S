Bringing this back slightly on-topic...
I agreee that the wide spread of gcc versions is causing increasing
grief.  Do you think we should lay 2.7.2.3 to rest, and nominate a
different compiler version as the "officially supported" one?
It seems that relatively few people are still using 2.7.2.3.
When is gcc-3.0 to be released to manufacturing?
