The patch also needs to handle group destruction too; currently it
leaves cpuset pointers dangling. So it would either have to refuse
removing a group when there are still irqs associated, or move them to
the parent.
But yeah, this was just a quick hack to show the idea, glad you like it.
Will try to flesh it out a bit in the coming week.
