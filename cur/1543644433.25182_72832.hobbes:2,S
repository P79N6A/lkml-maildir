BTW: Have you tried gcc 3.2 with say -finline-limit=2000 too?
By default gcc 3.2 has for usual C code smaller inlining cutoff, so the IO
difference might as well be because some important, but big function was
inlined by 2.95.x and not by 3.2.x. On the other side there is
__attribute__((always_inline)) which you can use to tell gcc you don't
want any cutoff for a particular function.
