A thread about getting vertical synchronization
interrupts from a video card is available at, 
http://groups.google.ca/group/alt.lang.asm/browse_frm/thread/d1057c825a7933f0/f7239ffb484587d9
I have started a project to write a windowing program
on svgalib at, 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/svgalib-windows
 
My idea is, 
1. Convert svgalib drivers into kernel modules to get
v-sync interrupts. 
2. Write a windowing program on svgalib. 
Everyone can join.
