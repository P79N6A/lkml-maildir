So the following code in refill_inactive_scan only exists in my
imagination?
	    if (page_count(page) <= (page->buffers ? 2 : 1)) {
		    deactivate_page_nolock(page);
		    page_active = 0;
	    } else {
		    page_active = 1;
	    }
We only move pages to the inactive list when they have one reference
from the page cache and one from buffers. Since all mapped pte's also
keep a reference, this means that there cannot be any pte's that point
to this page by the time we decide to deactivate the page.

And that is because we only move it after all pte's have been unmapped.
