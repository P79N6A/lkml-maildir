This is the closest it appears to be possible to narrow down where the
regression happened.
Some form of changelogging to enumerate what the contents of the
2.6.6-bk6 -> 2.6.6-bk7 delta are and to reconstruct intermediate points
between 2.6.6-bk6 and 2.6.6-bk7 is needed.
I have already tried to carry out various procedures to accomplish this
for several other problem reports and/or issues and come have come away
from the effort highly discouraged (having made zero progress) each time.
