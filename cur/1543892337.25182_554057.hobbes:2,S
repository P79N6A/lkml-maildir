Might be better to say 3 Gigabytes instead of 3.5.  I booted a 4gb kernel on
a machine with 4gb at work and only saw 3gb of memory.
Also, I've noticed that there's ~128mb of memory lost if you select 1gb when
you have 1gb of memory installed.

Same here

It's probably worth it to just say 3gb.
I've looked at the cpuinfo for several machines, all of which (pIII and
better, not all physically support even 2gb of memory) show pae in the
flags, so is there really a reason not to just specify 64gb always?
The oldest machine I have access to is a pII 333mhz machine, cpuinfo also
lists pae in the cpu flags.
