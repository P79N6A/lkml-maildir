Hi!
I have the following problem since I switched from bcm4400 to the
`in-kernel' driver b44:
Sep  1 17:37:11 gandalf vmunix: b44: eth0: Link is up at 10 Mbps, half duplex.
Sep  1 17:37:11 gandalf vmunix: b44: eth0: Flow control is off for TX and off for RX.
Sep  1 17:37:16 gandalf vmunix: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
Sep  1 17:37:16 gandalf vmunix: b44: eth0: transmit timed out, resetting
Sep  1 17:37:17 gandalf vmunix: b44: eth0: Link is down.
Sep  1 17:37:20 gandalf vmunix: b44: eth0: Link is up at 10 Mbps, half duplex.
Sep  1 17:37:20 gandalf vmunix: b44: eth0: Flow control is off for TX and off for RX.
and so on. This didn't (and still does not) happen with the bcm4400
(from debian sid bcm4400-source).
I compiled the kernel myself on debian/sid, it is a laptop (acer tm654).
If you need more information I will provide all I can do.
Best wishes
Norbert
