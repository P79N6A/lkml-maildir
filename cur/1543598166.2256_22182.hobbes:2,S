I'm curious was this embedded system or was it a stock PowerPC.  I
don't know of any off the shelf machines that come with BIOS source code.

As another data point, I earlier tried a similiar experiment by
accident.  In that case I forgot to enable ram refresh.   And then
read and wrote patterns to the SDRAM.  In that case I could find one
or two bits wrong (but 99.99% of them correct), after only a second or
two.

Ah you have one of the nice memory controllers.  On some you have
to do the prefreshs & co manually on others the memory controller will
do it for you.
The result here is interesting.  So while you don't loose everything
on powerdown.  About a minute after power down you do.  Not perfect
but it should be good enough to consider RAM self deleting in most
cases.  Except for the reset case which could prove very dangerous.  
For any of these attacks to prove workable you need to get a hold of
the machine while the power is still on.
So the attacker has two way to attack your machine.  Attempt to break
in while it is still running.  Put in a minimal boot cd and press
reset and see how much is recovered.  Generally breaking should prove
the more fruitful course, but the fact that reset preseves all of the
memory, means it simply is not safe for someone to have physical
access to your machine while the power is on.
Or do you read this differently?
