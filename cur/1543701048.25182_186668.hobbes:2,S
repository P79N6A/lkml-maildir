Luckily for me, I built my cdrom drivers as modules, so I could play :)
I turned on debugging, and noticed that cdi->use_count continues to increment by
2 for each access. In cdrom_release, only one cdi->use_count-- exists, so the
driver never gets to 0 use count and releases. I noticed in
drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c line 753:
        if (!ret) cdi->use_count++;
Which is our second increment, but I can't find two decrements, because the
check further down won't ever be true if the above is true. Hence, two
increments and only 1 dec when we reach cdrom_release. What I did, was add a
conditional decrement right before the open_for_data call, which makes the value
of use_count like it used to be prior to the Mt. Rainier patches. Seems kinda
hacky :)
