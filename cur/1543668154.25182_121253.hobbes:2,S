I don't mind temporary solutions, but I prefer the ones, which don't have 
to be thrown away completely (e.g. like Andries char device changes).
If Andries would actually explain, what he wants to do with the larger 
dev_t, it would be a lot easier to help him, so that we can at least avoid 
the biggest mistakes.
