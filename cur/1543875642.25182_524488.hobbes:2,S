| Why do you need this?
Setting result to 0 indicate that there is no errors. Pete, look
this init code does the following - 
	1) creates 3 workqueues
	2) register usb driver
So we have:
	- at each step of creating worqueue we have to check if it was
	  succsessfull
	- if all workqeues were successfully created we need to check if
	  usb registration failed
So we can get error on any step and there is a question how to properly
and eleganly handle them... the solution I proposed maybe is not ideal
but you may help me supposing your own patch :)
And as result I set 'results=0' to prevent from printing message about
worqueue fails if the error _really_ occured in usb_register. Just
review the function at whole and you will find the reason.

Agree, may be the labels could be like:
	err_respond_queue:
and so on?

| What in the world is this supposed to do? Under what conditions can

If error was in worqueue creation then there will be 0.

Can't agree... if modprobe failed I wonna know _where_ it happens and
why :) Or maybe I misunderstood you...
