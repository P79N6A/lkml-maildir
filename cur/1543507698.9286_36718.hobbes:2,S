[1.] One line summary of the problem:    
Filesystem corruption under 2.2.12
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
Under Linux 2.2.12 (and 2.2.11) one directory gets
mysteriously corrupted always when some cron-job
scans it. This didn't happen under 2.0.x. I first
suspected HD's DMA-mode but disabling it didn't help.
The message is:
EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,5)): ext2_readdir: bad
entry in directory #18682: rec_len is smaller than
minimal - offset=0, inode=393222, rec_len=7, name_len=6
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
filesystem, ext2, corruption
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
Linux version 2.2.12
[7.] Environment
[7.1.] Software (add the output of the ver_linux script here)
-- Versions installed: (if some fields are empty or looks
-- unusual then possibly you have very old versions)

[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds:
I have included two dumps of the directory in question:
-dump1 is the (correct?) directory after e2fsck
-dump2 is the corrupted directory
Also included are config options for kernel and
'dmesg' output.[unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream][unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream]#
