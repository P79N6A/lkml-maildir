Yes, I think so. My suspects were due to my misunderstanding.
I was wrong when I said that we can ignore rmb() part of mb()
in case when start_hz_timer() runs after rcu_start_batch().
	rcp->cur++;
	// ->cur will be visible to other cpus
	// _before_ we will *READ* nohz_cpu_mask.
	// we don't have any 'timing' problems.
	// In other words: if another cpu does not
	// see the new value - we did not read this
	// mask yet.
	smp_mb();
Thanks for your patience.

Yes! it was really helpful, thanks to all. I think it would be great
to have Paul's very clear (and short!) explanation somewhere in
Documentation/.
Oleg.
