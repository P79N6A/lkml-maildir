I am talking about snapshot_system() here. It's not given that the 
filesystems need to be read-only (you can snapshot them too). The benefit 
here is that you can do whatever you want with the snapshot (encrypt, 
compress, send over the network)  and have a clean well-defined interface 
in the kernel. In addition, aborting the snapshot is simpler, simply 
munmap() the snapshot.
The problem with writing in the kernel is obvious: we need to add new code 
to the kernel for compression, encryption, and userspace interaction 
(graphical progress bar) that are important for user experience.
