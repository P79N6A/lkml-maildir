Not a single one of the devices in my collection features vendor_name_kv 
in the ROM's unit directory. The vendor_name_kv in the ROM's root 
directory more often reflects the vendor of the enclosure or bridge 
board than the vendor of the bridge chip. (Most vendors of enclosures or 
boards seem to put only their name into a firmware although they have 
the opportunity for market differentiation by an own firmware full of 
their very own bugs...)

A few older Initio based enclosures needed it. Newer don't, including 
the one I have here. AFAIK the 36byte inquiry workaround does not break 
anything if forced onto non-broken devices.
