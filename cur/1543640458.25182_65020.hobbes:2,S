You're right it's incorrect to say cleanly

That's great, I think there's a big advantage doing this because if this 
data lies in the driver model code then it's very easy to standardize 
interfaces for hardware and power management

Could you please send me a patch, if there is one, concerning your work 
with conditional attributes, I'd love to take a look.  If we could work 
something out like this it would solve all kinds of problems.  I'll look 
into it.  Remember that devfs patch I had a while ago.  Instead of using 
devfs handles I could use kdev_t and export the major and minor through 
a conditional attribute.  If so should a list of major and minor pairs 
be in one file?
Also when you say conditional attributes do you mean conditional in the 
device structure as well.  In other words do you mean a list or hash of 
attributes in the device structure?
Thanks,
Adam
