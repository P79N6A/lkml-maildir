I see, "follows" the other way around. That fixes the breakage but I
guess it's not exactly what the people doing make menuconfig want.
Though in absence of the following it would IMHO make sense anyway.

I fear it too but perhaps there is some sane way? I don't know,
asking (recursively?) interactively?
Like:
QWERTY requires at least one, select (Y/M):
- ARCH_X86 && NET_ETHERNET, or
- USB4_0 && !SMP, or
- XXX
then:
NET_ETHERNET requires at lest one, select (Y/M):
- PCI128
- ISA256
then (info):
PCI128 requires PCI and it's selected automatically.
I don't know. It could be useful even with a single dependency when
configuring as the module, the user could select Y or M for dependency
interactively (people may want to have E1000E=m and TULIP=m but MII=y).
Not sure if still on the same planet, though :-)
