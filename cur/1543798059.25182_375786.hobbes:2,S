If it gets it wrong X deadlocks, but yes, it does seem... odd.

Ah, yes, tuxracer does have fairly high demands, doesn't it.

I just installed the latest ppracer alpha (the closest out there to
tuxracer)
OK, I see 25-40fps with that, with DRI. If I turn on stencil buffering
it gets unbearable, but that's just asking too much of the card I think.

Ah, this is a pure-PCI 9250, is it? (I wasn't aware you could get hold
of those anymore... I think X supports them, but textured stuff is
necessarily going to be slower.)
