It's not that easy -- there are different windows versions out who
do different things. Sometimes systems are built for older windows
versions, sometimes systems are built for newer windows versions.
They don't necessarily work on newer versions.
But people expect Linux to run on all of them.

I'm not aware of that many systems where reboot doesn't work.
Also I'm sure there are some who don't reboot even in Windows.
Another reason is probably that reboot is quite hard to debug.
One recently new problem is that some systems don't have keyboard
controllers anymore so that method obviously doesn't work. But 
it doesn't hurt to try it first because it's unlikely to break
something
The triple fault fallback is normally quite reliable though.
I would expect that putting the ACPI method in the middle
is probably safe enough.
