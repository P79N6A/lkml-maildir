Marcelo,
Prefetch has undergone extensive testing internally. Other groups are
continuing to test it, also. All controllers on the street now have
prefetch enabled. When version 1.92 of the controller f/w is released
prefetch will be disabled by default. This patch re-enables it on x86 only
because of a _big_ performance hit in RAID1 operations.
This is on my list for 2.6. Since it has now been released I will begin
submitting updates after Christmas. (My list for 2.6 is extensive.)
Also, please include this version of the patch rather than my first
submission. I moved a variable inside the ifdef to clean up warnings on
non-x86 platforms.
Thanks,
mikem
