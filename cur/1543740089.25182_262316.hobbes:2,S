In Makefiles for compiling modules before the new
kernel build procedure, we would just build up
a gcc command-line with the correct parameters
and definitions, i.e. :
CC = gcc -Wall -O2 -etc -etc
DEFINES = -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ -DONE=1 -DTWO=2 -DETC=etc
CC += $(DEFINES)
In this manner, one could dynamically change definitions
(-DEFINES) being passed to the compiler. The problem is
that the new compile procedure doesn't allow this. It
is possible to 'cheat' and add a string to CFLAGS like
CFLAGS += -DONE=1 -DTWO=2 -DETC=etc
...but it's not CFLAGS that needs to be modified, it's
a named variable that doesn't exist yet, perhaps "USERDEF",
or "DEFINES". I see that the normal "defines" is a constant 
called "CHECKFLAGS", so this isn't appropriate for user
modification.
Could whomever remade the kernel Makefile, please add
a variable, initially set to "", like CFLAGS_KERNEL, that
is exported and is always included on the compiler command-
line?
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
