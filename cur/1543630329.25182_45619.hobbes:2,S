I didn't save the address of the person who reported the reboot
error...
This c++ code was reported to reboot a machine.
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <iterator>
using namespace std;
int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    string raw_filename = "input.out";
    ifstream raw_file(raw_filename.c_str());
    vector<long> data;
    copy(istream_iterator<long>(raw_file),istream_iterator<long>(),back_inserter(data));
    data.erase(data.begin());
    return 0;
}

On Linux 2.4.18, the program just seg-faults (as it should).
On the version you are using, you should write a 'C' program
that does lseek() beyond EOF. There could be a bug there, but
otherwise I can't tell from the program presented.
Cheers,
