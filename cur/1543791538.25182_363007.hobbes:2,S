Matt responded to a private that I posted to Dave and Matt. Matt is
traveling and told me to go ahead and post a fix.
I removed memory_present called from the FLATMEM routine contig_initmem_init.
Otherwise my original quick patch used for testing SPARSEMEM EXTREME
was nearly complete.
I've boot tested all three configurations (SPARSEMEM, DISCONTIGMEM and CONTIG)
on my DL585 (4 node machine).
