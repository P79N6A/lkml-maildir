Not unless you're talking floating-point/MMX, or using the RDTSC
instruction.
However, if you have a reasonable limit on how long you may be
interrupted (1/2 of the major increment) you can do this without
loops:
	mov (xtime_sec),%ecx
	mov (xtime_usec),%eax
	mov (xtime_sec),%edx
	cmp %eax,500000			; 1/2 of the major increment
	jb 1f
	mov %ecx,%edx
1:	; Result in %edx:%eax
If the minor counter is less than halfway to rollover, it is safe to
assume the value read immediately *after* is stable; if it's more than
halfway, that the value read immediately *before* is stable.  One
advantage with not having a loop is that you don't bias the output.
