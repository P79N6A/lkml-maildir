The GPL is very clear in its implementation: it grants wider permission
to create derivative works than to distribute them, implementing its
"virality" in terms of restrictions on distribution, not creation.  So,
it seems that you're claiming that the GPL is broken or unenforcable in
some aspects.  (If you're not, I'd like to know where I'm confused.)
If that's the case, it's a claim I'm not qualified to debate, but would
be interested in hearing the FSF's response.
