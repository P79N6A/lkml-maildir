Putting a task to sleep _is_ rescheduling it.  TASK_NONINTERACTIVE  
means that you are about to reschedule and are willing to tolerate a  
higher wakeup latency.  TASK_INTERRUPTABLE means you are about to  
sleep and want to be woken up using the "standard" latency.  If you  
do any kind of sleep at all, both are valid, independent of what part  
of the kernel you are.  There's a reason that both are TASK_* flags.
Cheers,
