We _definitely_ prefer "irq" over something else that means the same 
thing.
If GSI means some _specific_ interrupt, and thus has additional meaning 
over "irq", then by all means, use it, but spell it out. "Global System 
Interrupt" means _nothing_ to me. What makes it "global"? What makes it 
"system"?
The _only_ thing that uses "gsi" is the MP table stuff, and that's 
apparently just from the documentation.
In other words, if it's a normal interrupt, it's "irq" or "interrupt". The 
same way a "disk" is a "disk" - it's not a DASD. 
Stupid acronyms that don't actually mean anything more than the standard 
name are nothing but stupid.
Interrupts are interrupts. We call them something else only if they are 
_specific_ interrupts (ie a "NMI" clearly has a very _specific_ meaning, 
as has "SCI", although the latter is already obscure enough that it's 
probably a good idea to spell it out a bit if it is ever used outside of a 
context where use is obvious).
