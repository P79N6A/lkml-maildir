Hmm, curious.
please explain. 
==
int __add_pages(struct zone *z, unsigned long start_pfn, unsigned long nr_pages)
{
        int err = -EIO;
        unsigned long pfn;
        unsigned long total = 0, mem = 0;
        for (pfn = start_pfn; pfn < start_pfn + nr_pages; pfn++) {
                if (pfn_valid(pfn)) {
                        online_page(pfn_to_page(pfn));
                        err = 0;
                        mem++;
                }
                total++;
        }
        if (!err) {
                z->spanned_pages += total;
                z->present_pages += mem; -------------------------------(*)
                z->zone_pgdat->node_spanned_pages += total;
                z->zone_pgdat->node_present_pages += mem;
        }
        return err;
}

It looks contents of zone is increased at (*). Do I see old code ?
==
static inline int populated_zone(struct zone *zone)
{
        return (!!zone->present_pages);
}
==
"empty zone" I said means a zone which is not populated.
this populated_zone() is used at build_zone_list().
if populated_zone(z)==0, zone "z" is not included into zonelist and zone will be never
used.
