from 2.6.24-rc6-mm1 patch-series file:
slub-noinline-some-functions-to-avoid-them-being-folded-into-alloc-free.patch
slub-move-kmem_cache_node-determination-into-add_full-and-add_partial.patch
slub-move-kmem_cache_node-determination-into-add_full-and-add_partial-slub-workaround-for-lockdep-confusion.patch
slub-avoid-checking-for-a-valid-object-before-zeroing-on-the-fast-path.patch
It seems it got lumped into some other slub patches, but the bug does
not seem to be introduced by them, as I can see it in mainline
2.6.24-rc6.
Should this patch made a candidate for the merge-before-2.6.24-final-queue?
