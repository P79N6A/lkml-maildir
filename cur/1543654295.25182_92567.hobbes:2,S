I'm using Debian Testing, which is (the maintainer's own?) version
1.29+1.30-WIP-0930-1.  Debian Unstable is now on version 1.32 (and
Testing should get updated to this soon?).  Mind you, what I have
installed is almost 2 months old.
Just in case, I'll upgrade to 1.32 before I try to duplicate the
problem on 2.4.20.  Thanks for your time and trouble :^)
