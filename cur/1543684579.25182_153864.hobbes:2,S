Hello!
Finally I have decided to submit my kernel oopses I have been
experiencing. It became annoying since i switched to use Linux as my
primary OS. They happen average once a day. I am not sure whether it is an
ext3 bug or memory problems, so I am sending them to this address I have
found in Documentation dir of kernel tree.
I am using Slackware linux with 2.4.21 kernel:
Linux repetus 2.4.21-ow2 #14 sob sie 2 17:07:14 CEST 2003 i686 unknown
unknown GNU/Linux
Kernel is tainted, as I am using NVIDIA graphics driver to run my X11.
Bugs happen both in text as in graphical mode. Most of them are somewhat
connected to kswapd, as it is the most frequent phrase I observed in them.
Please contact if you need more info.
