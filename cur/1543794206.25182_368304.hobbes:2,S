Greetings.
The place where the connection tracking helper modules are called from changed
from 2.6.9 to 2.6.12.
In 2.6.9, helper modules were called from ip_conntrack_core.c (
ip_conntrack_in function)
In 2.6.12, the helper modules are called from
ip_conntrack_standalone.c (ip_conntrack_help funtion)
I would like to use the 2.6.12 kernel, but with helper modules called
like in 2.6.9
I was wondering if other parts of the system would be affetcted if I
put the helper module call in
ip_conntrack_in and remove the call from ip_conntrack_help
Any help or information is greatly appreciated.
Thanks a lot,
Thomas
