??? trylock is always safe. You can deadlock _only_ spinning on the lock.
As far as you don't spin you can do everything you want at any time.
And BTW lru_list_lock is the first one to grab, so you can grab it at any
time, and if somebody is just grabbing it plus something else then you'll
find the lru_list_lock as just busy and you'll giveup in trylock.
