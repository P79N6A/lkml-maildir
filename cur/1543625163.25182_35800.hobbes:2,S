Unfortunately so.  I have some boards here that have higher precision
timers but nothing approaching the clock rate of the chip.  I don't think
there are any PPC boards with timers at that rate.
Some of the 6xx or 74xx model debug registers may have something useful
here, though.
} Oh, you're cycle timer is too slow to be interesting, apparently ;(
