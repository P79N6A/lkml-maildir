Same behavior as the old code.  I/Os are broken up into at most 
max_readahead size pieces.  In the case of the old code only 1 of these 
could be outstanding. In the new code there could be at most 2 
outstanding at any point in time.

This is why for these types of applications, especially on RAID arrays, 
you need to set max_readahead into the MBs. (But that is a different topic).
