Regardless of issues addressed, Andi's been working with everyone for
something on the order of 12+ months and this is out of the blue. I very
very strongly suggest that you take up each of these issues with him so
that they can be addressed as individual incremental improvements to the
API everyone's been working with for all that time as opposed to screwing
the world (esp. now that commodity NUMA boxen are becoming more prevalent)
with transparent and deliberate distro-competition motivated API skew.
