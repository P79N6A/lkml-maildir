I don't know whether this has been posted already as the search engine on
kernelnotes is broken but,
i20 is broken from 2.3.43 up to and including 2.3.48 by a change in
netdevice.h. struct net_device has
been altered by the removal of start and tbusy data members. Code in
i20_lan.c relies on both of these
data.
