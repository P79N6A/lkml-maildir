After bashing my poor bruised head against the screen for a
considerable period I've discovered that memset'ing your IO space
to zero is a very good way to stop your machine dead, silently.

When clearing a large page allocation ensure we use a page clear function
which will correctly clear a ZONE_HIGHMEM page.
