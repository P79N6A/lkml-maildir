Heh.  I have a USB mouse and I see similar problems:
Red Hat 9 (more or less), XFree86-4.3.0-2, kernel 2.6.0-test10, dual
athlon, USB Logitech optical mouse, configured to read from
/dev/input/mice (only!).
Every few hours the mouse suddenly jumps to a corner of the screen and
seems broken for a second or so.  After that I can move it back to
where it is useful.
I never noticed such behaviour when running 2.4 on this box, nor when
running earlier 2.6 kernels.
There is nothing about "atkbd" or "mouse" or "lost synchronisation" in
the kernel log.
