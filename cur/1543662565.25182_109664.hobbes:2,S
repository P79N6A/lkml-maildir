Since only one driver can register as the /dev/watchdog (ie
major=10/minor=130 char device), would it be better if:
* the first watchdog driver to register with the base also gets
registered as the watchdog misc device, and when that driver unregisters
then the second watchdog to register now gets registered as the misc
device, etc.
* each watchdog driver gets an additional sysfs file named 'misc', where
writing a '1' to the file causes the driver to become the registered
misc watchdog device.
* something else
