    I need to increase the open files per process from 1024 to 32768.
However, it seems that if I change the INR_OPEN value in
include/linux/fs.h I break a number of important user side utils.  Is
the only fix for this to recompile those utils?
    I guess I could use ulimit to increase the # of open files per
process but that doesn't seem to be as clean a solution.
