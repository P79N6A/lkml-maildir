This is a bit off-topic, but in that particular case we can do
	if (cancel_work_sync(&A))
		A->func(&A);
unless we want to execute ->func() on another CPU of course. It is easy to
implement flush_work() which waits for a single work_strcut, but it is not
so useful when it comes to schedule_on_each_cpu().
But I agree, flush_workqueue() should be avoided if possible. Not sure
it makes sense, but we can do something like below.
Oleg.
