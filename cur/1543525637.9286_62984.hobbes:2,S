Hi,
For the past few weeks there's been a change in linux-kernel posts. The
From:, Date:, and certain other headers are followed by tabs instead of
spaces. This breaks things like 'grepmail'. Manually removing the tabs from
just the From: and Date: headers seems to fix it.
Is this an intentional change, or can it be reverted back to the old way? I
currently use 'grepmail' to help generate the 'stats' section of Kernel
Traffic. It's only a small inconvenience to edit the mailboxes by hand, but
I thought I'd post here anyway, in case it was a bug in the list software.
Be well,
Zack
