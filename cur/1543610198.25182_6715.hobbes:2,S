This seems to be just bad indentation rather than a bug. 'targ[j]=0'
seems to have the purpose of zero-terminating the string, if you look
at the callers of those functions. (But yes, the code is extremely
hard to read, and I can't convince myself either way about whether the
|| two lines earlier should or shouldn't be an &&.)
