No. The real bugs were that the people involved wouldn't even accept that 
unwinding information was inevitably buggy and/or incomplete.
That much more fundamental bug never got fixed, as far as I know. 
I'm not going to merge anything that depends on unwind tables as things 
stand. The pain just isn't worth it.

Good call. Dwarf2 unwinding simply isn't worth doing. But I won't yank it 
out, I simply won't merge it. It was more than just totally buggy code, it 
was an inability of the people to understand that even bugfree code 
isn't enough - you have to be able to also handle buggy data.
