Subject: compile failure for ipv4/netfilter/ipt_TCPMSS.c in 2.5.46

I get the following when compiling:
net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_TCPMSS.c: In function `ipt_tcpmss_target':
net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_TCPMSS.c:88: structure has no member named `pmtu'
net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_TCPMSS.c:91: structure has no member named `pmtu'
net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_TCPMSS.c:95: structure has no member named `pmtu'
I was looking around the headers (without much prior knowledge), and
wondering whether the statement:
(*pskb)->dst->pmtu
should be changed to:
(*pskb)->dst->dev->mtu
I'm just taking a stab at this; is this correct?
