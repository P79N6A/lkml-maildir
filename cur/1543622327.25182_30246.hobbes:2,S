There is no create and destroy (init is purely userspace).  There is
"this is a semapore: up it".  This is a feature.

Agreed with implicit locking: good catch.  Disagree with neatness: I
like finding out in advance that there's no fast semaphore support.

Since pages are pinned "on demand" and a process can only do one
syscall at a time, the maximum number of pinned pages per process ==
2.  Which is fine.
Will do syscall version, and see if I can actually get it to beat
fcntl locking on reasonable benchmarks (ie. tdbtorture).
Cheers!
Rusty.
PS.  Nomenclature: my fiance suggested FUS (Fast Userspace
     Semaphores), and I am legally obliged to agree.
