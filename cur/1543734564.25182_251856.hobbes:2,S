It's true that the atomic_add_return and the comparison are not executed
atomically, but they don't need to be: a value is equal to 0, or not,
however long ago that value was computed, no matter what happened since.
The important thing is that the value is the atomic result of the atomic
operation: which may not be the case when you use atomic_add followed by
atomic_read, but is what's guaranteed by atomic_add_return.
