Alan,
In fact, you are both right and wrong at the same time.  NWFS is not
dependent on a mirroed cache and hotfix/mirroring are architecturally
separate (Hotfix and mirrroing ARE independent of NWFS even in Netware),
however, there are fault tolerant dependencies that allow NWFS to handle
some very complex data failure and recovery conditions not available
with most other FS's.  It is possible to implement without it, but then
NWFS is not complete.  Netware allows mirrored objects at a cache
level.  There is also a very clean layer between disks and cache, unlike
Linux, which is quite frankly a big, nasty ***MESS*** between the disk
drivers and the buffer cache.  There's no obvious method of supporting
async callbacks (which will increase file system performance by several
hundred percent).
All I am suggesting is that we adopt a semantic similiar to what's in NT
and Netware today rather than stay stuck with a non-extensible
architecture.
