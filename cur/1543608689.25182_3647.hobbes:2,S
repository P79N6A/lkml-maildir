There might also be heuristics that explicitly _notice_ slow growth, not
necessarily as a function of time, but as a function of the tree structure
itself.
For example, spreading out (and the inherent assumption of "slow growth")
might make sense for the root directory, and possibly for a level below
that. It almost certainly does _not_ make sense for a directory created
four levels down.
