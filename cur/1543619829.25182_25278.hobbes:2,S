I already thought about that a bit... what if we changed /proc/apm again, 
adding one line for each possible battery slot?
The current format is:
<driver version> <BIOS version> <APM flags> <AC status> <battery status> 
<battery flag> <battery left (%)> <remaining time> <remaining time units 
(min/sec)>
I suggest we change the first line to reflect an overall battery status 
(i.e. average of all slots in system). Then we could add one line for each 
battery slot, indicating
<battery status> <battery flag> <battery left % > <remaining time in seconds>
I suggest we always show the new stuff in seconds because I like easily 
parsed things, and even shell scripts can divide by 60 if they want to ;)
If there's no battery in this slot, we can show the usual of -1's, or just 
put "? ? ? ?".
So on my system, I would see this if I did
$ cat /proc/apm
1.16 1.2 0x03 0x01 0x03 0x09 94% 283 min
0x04 0x80 -1 -1
0x03 0x09 94 16980
Whoever manages apmd also probably has some suggestions...
(btw, "Stephen" is a really great name ;)
