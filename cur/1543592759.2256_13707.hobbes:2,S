My sensors are working and appear to give the correct numbers; I'm just
getting a regular spew of messages from the SMB resets.

That's interesting, in light of the other message I just sent (i.e., DMA
enabled in BIOS, but *not* detected by the kernel).
What version of the BIOS are you running?  I'm still on the 1003b, because
I've heard a few horror stories about 1004 that have put me off upgrading.
I'm on kernel 2.4.4, with Athlon optimizations.

I think I tried it both ways earlier.  At any rate, since I had to reboot to
check the DMA settings I went ahead and set it back to 'off', and it still
says the same thing.
