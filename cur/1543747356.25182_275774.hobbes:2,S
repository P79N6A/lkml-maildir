Dammit, how hard is it for people to admit that they aren't the only ones 
around?
There are still people who use ancient setups, and upgrade the kernel. 
They won't complain to _you_ or to redhat when their setup breaks, because 
they aren't _using_ your setup. They complain to me.
This is what statisticians call "self-selection". It means that you guys 
only see the part of the world that uses your stuff, so you think that 
there is nothing else.
