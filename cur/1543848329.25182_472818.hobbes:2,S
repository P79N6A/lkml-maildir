According to the comment in the code, access is blocked only during the
time that the device is making the transition between different power
states.

Could you resubmit your old patches and include a corresponding fix for 
this access problem?
BTW, is it possible for userspace to try accessing a device in D3cold?  
Doesn't the fact that it is D3cold rather than D3hot mean the computer is 
turned off?  Or have I been missing out on new developments?
