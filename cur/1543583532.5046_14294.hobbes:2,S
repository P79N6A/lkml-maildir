Note that the Linux VM is certainly different enough that I doubt the
comparisons are all that valid. Especially actual virtual memory mapping
is basically from another planet altogether, and heuristics that are
appropriate for *BSD may not really translate all that better.
I'll take numbers over talk any day.  At least Mike had numbers, and
possible explanations for them. He also removed more code than he added,
which is always a good sign. 
In short, please don't argue against numbers.
