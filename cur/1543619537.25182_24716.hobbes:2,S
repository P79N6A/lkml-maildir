The only lockup problems I have run into are connecting some eepro nics to
a 10bt hub, and using (cheap arsed, it appears) PCI riser cards.  I have
heard of some SMP related issues, but nothing concrete, and I don't
have any SMP systems personally.  You could try the e100, but I have
no idea if it will be better or worse for your particular problem.
