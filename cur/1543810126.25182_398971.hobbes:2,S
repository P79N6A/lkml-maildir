Hi peter, I've had a good look and have just a couple of comments:
---
 #endif
        int prio, static_prio;
+#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
+       int load_weight;        /* for load balancing purposes */
+#endif

Can this be moved up to be part of the other ifdef CONFIG_SMP? Not highly 
significant since it's in a .h file but looks a tiny bit nicer.

The weighting seems not related to anything in particular apart from saying 
that -nice values are more heavily weighted. Since you only do this when 
setting the priority of tasks can you link it to the scale of (SCHED_NORMAL) 
tasks' timeslice instead even though that will take a fraction more 
calculation? RTPRIO_TO_LOAD_WEIGHT is fine since there isn't any obvious cpu 
proportion relationship to rt_prio level.
Otherwise, good work, thanks!
