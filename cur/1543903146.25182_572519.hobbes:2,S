That seems like an unsafe thing to do (unless we err out somewhere);
lest there is, say, a microcode update disabling clflush due to an erratum.
It also seems to me we should have a macro for clflush(), especially
since it is "clflush (%0)" :: "r" in a number of places, which really
isn't correct; it should be "clflush %0" : "+m", both to allow
addressing modes to be used and to give gcc a modicum of a hint that
something is going on with a specific memory location.
