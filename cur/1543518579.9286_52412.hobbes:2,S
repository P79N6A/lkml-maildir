That means going for the lowest common denominator, ie. 386 and SMP.
Thanks, but no thanks.  I don't mind one module being a bit
suboptimal, but the whole kernel?  Especially mm...
My argument only makes sense if you update modules independently of
the kernel proper, e.g., you want to install the latest network
drivers from Donald.  The ideal would be that rdist handled the module
directory for me.
