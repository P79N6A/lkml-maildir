I don't know, probably the ACPI code can now probably detect the
presence or absence of the HPET timer.
Can you remove CONFIG_FB_VESA support from your kernel config but boot
as if you have vesafb (ie with vga=<VESA mode number>). Your machine may
boot to completion but you will have a blank screen.  But you should be
able to have an output in netconsole and you can start X. I wanted to
know if the lockup is related to the framebuffer.
