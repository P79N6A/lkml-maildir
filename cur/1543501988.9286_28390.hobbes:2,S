Hmm, P'hap -EISDIR could be caught in an application (libc wrapper?)
library. 
Check if "blahblah.doc/.this-dir-is-an-albod" exists 
   and if so then  open a pipe to the output of tar -xz instead.
The only catch I can see is that some people what this to handle a
`default representation' instead, presumably so they can grep it or
whatever, with the existing tools.
To be honest people who are likely[1] to want to do that are likely to
know enough to look inside the directory and deal with it like that.
Of course this won't satisfy those who don't like the existing semantics
to be broken[2], but they can either not use albod-aware wrappers and
avoid them.  (which they will do anyway - I'm assuming here this group
in congruent with the don't want/need albods group). Or just not use
these tools on albod directories.
A second problem is undocumented directory (read: file) formats - but we
don't have any of those do we?
TTFN
[1]     I use the word likely here as I'm sure someone has an exception 
        to raise.
[2]     Like directories silently turning into pipes. Put like that it 
        sounds horrible doesn't it.[3]
[3]     Eek. My vote has to be to keep it in user-space. I was thinking  
        of proposing the FS gives the lib writers 1 bit or so per inode 
        as a flag for this sort of thing but it's broken over NFS and
        the above mechanism doesn't need it..[4]
[4]     Do doubt so one will find something wrong with it.[4]
        (like a stack overflow)
