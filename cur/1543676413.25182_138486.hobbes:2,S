Yes, but the comment certainly is confusing.  How about something like
this:
/*
 * PCI_DMA_BUS_IS_PHYS should be set to 1 if there is necessarily a
 * direct corespondence between device bus addresses and CPU physical
 * addresses.  Platforms with a hardware I/O MMU _must_ turn this off
 * to suppress the bounce buffer handling code in the block and
 * network device layers.  Platforms with separate bus address spaces
 * _must_ turn this off and provide a device DMA mapping
 * implementation that takes care of the necessary address
 * translation.
 */
#define PCI_DMA_BUS_IS_PHYS	pci_dma_bus_is_phys

This sounds all very dramatic, but try as I might, all I find is three
places where PCI_DMA_BUS_IS_PHYS is used:
	- ide-lib.c: used to disable bounce buffering
	- scsi_lib.c: used to disable bounce buffering
	- tg3.c: what the heck??
The tg3 code looks ugly in the extreme (sorry).  If I understand it
right, it's trying to work around a bug which shows up when a packet
covers a certain address?  With an I/O MMU, you then remap the
offending buffer again before freeing the old mapping which will
ensure a different address of the packet, whereas in the non-I/O MMU
case, you copy the entire socket buffer (since just remapping it won't
change the address and since there is no interface to copy just a
portion of a socket buffer) and then do the remapping.
Did I get this right (or at least close enough)?
It seems really bad to me to rely on implementation-specifics of the
DMA API.  I suspect the code would break on a platform which has
separate bus address spaces but no (hardware) I/O TLB?  (Yeah,
probably not a supported scenarious, but with a proper fix, this
wouldn't be a problem.)
Does this bug happen often enough that it's performance critical?
Otherwise, you could just always use the copy-the-entire-buffer
workaround.  If its performance-critical, would it make sense
to extend the socket buffer API to allow copying a portion of
a buffer?
I really dislike PCI_DMA_BUS_IS_PHYS, because it introduces a
discontinuity.  I don't think it should be necessary.
If it wasn't for tg3.c, couldn't PCI_DMA_BUS_IS_PHYS be gotten rid of
much more cleanly with a dma_max_phys_addr(dev) function, which would
return the maximum physical address that device DEV can address
(either directly, or via an I/O TLB)?

Yes.  Would you mind fixing that?
