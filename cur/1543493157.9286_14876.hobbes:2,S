Hi!
I think that there is a SMP race in the put_pio_request() and 
get_pio_request() in mm/filemap.c. The PIO list may get corrupted if
several processors access it at once.
May be someone might like to add a spinlock there (or tell me that there
is no race because of <some smart explanation here>).
