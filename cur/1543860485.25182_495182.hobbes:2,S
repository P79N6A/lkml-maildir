To avoid any misunderstandings:
This wasn't in any way meant against you personally.
And in this case you were right, it was the same bug.
My answer was based on experiences like one during 2.6.19-rc where we 
had 4 bug reports for a regression with a patch available. And it turned 
out that one of them was for a completely different regression.
That's why I prefer to get confirmations that a user actually run into 
the same issue, and not into something completely different with similar 
symptoms.
