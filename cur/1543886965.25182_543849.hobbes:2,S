On the occasions that that happens to me, It's almost always due to
stripped whitespace. If it were charset-conversion, looking at the patch
should surely highlight the problem?

Gmane didn't do that¹ -- Anton did. But it would apply just fine anyway;
Anton's error only causes a _cosmetic_ issue when viewing his mail, not
a problem with applying the patch.
The Content-Type: header only actually matters to git-am for the commit
