Subject: [PATCH 3/4] Fix networked filesystems to handle ATTR_KILL_ bits correctly
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/20/283

This fixes NFS and CIFS to take advantage of the new scheme for
handling setuid/setgid bits. For these filesystems we want to just
let the server handle clearing these bits since the client may not
have permissions to do so.
For CIFS, this adds a patch to clear the ATTR_KILL bits so that
notify_change doesn't try to do a second setattr. NFS already clears
these bits, and this just updates a comment to make it clear
that doing this is more than an optimization.
