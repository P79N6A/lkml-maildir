Yes, and no (it does the same thing as your version internally, so
no downside).

Yeah: do all that in cpusets. It's already information you would have
to derive in order to make it work properly anyway. If you are not
passing in the singleton domains ATM, then they will not get properly
detached and isolated.

detach_destroy and build are things that may get reimplemented to
suit different capabilities (eg. we might want to have multiple trees of
domains for each CPU). So I think it is important to expose the simple
partition API which should be unambiguous and stable.
It's not a huge deal, but I'd like to keep partition_sched_domains. After
my patch, it's really simple.
