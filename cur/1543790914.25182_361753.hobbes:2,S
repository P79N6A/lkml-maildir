And since there isn't a Bluetooth device on s390 (yet), we can live with
the broken input core for now. Would be nicer if the input layer would
work but there are more important things..

.. e.g. this one. I tried to cleanup the Kconfig for s390 once. After
the patch has grown over 2000 lines of code I gave up. If you have the
feeling that this should be fixed I'll give it another try. At least the
issue with ARCH_S390/ARCH_S390X vs. S390/S390_64 should be fixed.
