OK, running dosemu at the console does not cause a lock up.  More
specifically:  just running dosemu doesn't cause a lock up ever.  To get
it to lock up, I have to run this game I play.  Under X, just running the
game and waiting at the game's main menu causes the lock up in a couple
minutes.  At the console, the game's graphics mode is not supported, so I
get a blank screen.  But if I run the game blind and wait at the main
menu, there is never a lock up.
Also, it seems that turning off preempt makes the problem go away.  At
least, I haven't got any lockups yet.
Cheers, Wayne
