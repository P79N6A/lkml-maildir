Ok, I'll drop the big-patch format... this is against draft 5 :)
This drops most of the last changes, since they didn't get used...
I'm taking the ISDN approach and splitting patches up for higher
chances of acceptance :)
1) s/millenium/millennium/
   This should not need an explanation :)
2) 
-* The already legendary linux performance is significantly enhanced.
-  High end SMP scaling gives good performance on 12 processor 
-  machines. Linux 2.2 supports up to 64 processor systems.
+* The already legendary Linux performance is significantly enhanced.
+  High-end SMP support scales well, supporting up to 64 processor systems.
   a) Linux should always be capitalized
   b) "gives good performance on 12 processor" implies to me as a consumer
      poor performance from 13 to 64 :)  or maybe even 2-11...
   c) referencing 2.2 is silly since that's what the release is about
3)
-cope with the massive expected deman for this upgrade, the Linux Kernel
-Archive has a whole heirarchy of mirror servers worldwide which are in place
+cope with the massive expected demand for this upgrade, the Linux Kernel
+Archive has a hierarchy of mirror servers worldwide which are in place
   a) spell fix for demand
   b) spell fix for hierarchy
   c) "whole" seemed useless
4)
-It interoperates well with a wide variety of other systems.
-Linux can take advantage of modern PC and PowerMac hardware
-or give new life to older 386 and 486 based computers. Several other
-processors, including the 64-bit Alpha and UltraSPARC are also
-supported.Support contracts are available from vendors and due to the open
-source nature of Linux to numerous third party organisations. Linux is
-provided under an unlimited use license that lets users make in-house
-customizations to the system itself. Latest estimates suggest that Linux has
-up to 20 million users worldwide.

   a) Alpha and UltraSparc seemed like an add-on in the original phrasing
   b) "Support" needs a space before it since it starts a sentence (or two)
   c) use of both "high-end" and "low-end" gives a clearer picture
   d) "due to the open source nature of Linux" comma'ed off for clarity
   e) "organisations" to "organizations" *shrug*
