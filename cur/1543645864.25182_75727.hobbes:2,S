Got this error on one occasion when leaving make xconfig - 'ERROR - Attempting to write value for unconfigured variable (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDESCSI).', but I suspect it is just a warning.
More oddly, there are two instances of 'Generic PCI IDE chipset suppport' in IDE, ATA and ATAPI Block devices.
More details on request,
John.
