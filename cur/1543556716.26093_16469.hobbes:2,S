What's wrong with returning -Exxx error code when the user requests
unsupported interface or function?
I think we should just #define possible values in standard include file
and make ifconfig/ip use it. We can add additional media types as
required.
2.5 task IMHO.
I think we need few ioctl calls: get + set media (int argument),
get + set speed (probably two - RX and TX), etc.
In my 2.4 HDLC stuff - to be published :-( - there something like that
(in private ioctl range, of course).
