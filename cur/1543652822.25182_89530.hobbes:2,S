This sounds intriguing.
Bill, if I may borrow from your data structure expertise,
what would you do if you wanted gid_t's indexed by two criteria?
Obviously, we want them them indexed by value (to look them up
for access checking), but NFS also needs them sorted by usage,
to fit the last 3 into the RPC parameters. This looks like
something requiring two overlaying trees who share leafs,
and every leaf being a single gid_t, with nightmarish overhead.
Before Tim came to the scene, the hope was that lookups would
do exhaustive search of arrays, sorted by LRU, while RPC
picked N leading elements of said sorted array. Tim busts
this scheme to pieces, because he sorts arrays by value
(if I read it right).
