Who knows? But I suppose they will notice if this would ever become a
problem.

Everything should be gated below linux.binaries.* then...
The reason I think it's acceptable to not do this is that the traffic is
low even when a few binaries are gated.
Someday[1] I plan to create a linux.binaries.patches group to distribute
kernel patches, but as usual it will be moderated.

soon.
[1] Or closer, if somebody will contribute a script able to detect new
kernel patches in a kernel.org mirror...
