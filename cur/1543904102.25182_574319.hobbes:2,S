hrm...
     x86, serial: convert legacy COM ports to platform devices
     Make x86 COM ports into platform devices and don't probe for them
     if we have PNP.
This seems like it will break decades-long-working stuff, in favor of 
breaking new ground in our favorite area, "trusting the BIOS."
It's just not worth it for serial ports, IMO.  Serial ports are 
something that just shouldn't break at this late stage in the game.  My 
new Intel platform boxes don't even have serial ports, so I question the 
value of messing with serial port probing even more... because... just 
wait a year, and your box won't have a serial port either!  :)
I certainly don't object to the use of platform devices (or isa_driver), 
but the probe change seems questionable.  That's sorta analagous to 
rewriting the floppy driver probe routine.  Sure you could do it... but 
why risk all that damage and go through debugging all over again?
It seems clear from this report that we cannot, should not, trust BIOS 
for something (a) so simple and (b) that has been working for over a decade.
