Hi,
  I'm looking at 2.4.0-test5, but the code has been present in earlier
kernels.
  __add_to_page_cache(), in mm/filemap.c, is re-checking the page cache
after adding a new entry;
	__add_to_page_cache(...)
	{
		....
		alias = __find_page_nolock(mapping, offset, *hash);
		if (alias != page)
			BUG();
	}
  Obviously, this is good for debugging, but will it still be there when
2.4 becomes stable?  There isn't a comment suggesting its removal.
  BTW: As new pages appear to always be added to the head of a chain in
the page cache, and searches always start at a head, the alias check isn't
much of a debug check; it should find the page just added.  Given this,
the above check isn't much of a performance hit, either.
