Hi,
based on the touchkit USB and livebook PS/2 touchscreen driver,
I made a driver for the touchkit PS/2 version. The work is based upon
kernel 2.6.13.2 .
The egalax touchsreen controller (PS/2 or USB version) is used
in this 7" device:

Currently I'm using the PS/2 version in a DirectFB enviroment.

Could you please have a look at it and tell my your comments on
what would be additional required to get it included into kernel tree.
Please CC me on replies, as I'm not subscribed to this list.
