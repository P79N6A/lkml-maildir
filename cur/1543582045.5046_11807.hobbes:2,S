or more generally
<< lock;
read pte
if (!present(pte) || !writable(pte))
	do_page_fault();
pte |= dirty
write pte.

Not to mention, does it guarantee to use the newly read physical
address, does it check the superviser permission again, does it use the
new PAT/CD/WT attributes?
I can vaguely imagine some COW optimisation where the pte is updated to
be writable with the new page's address, and there is no need to flush
other processor TLBs because they will do so when they first write to
the page.  (But of course you have to be careful synchronising with
other uses of the shared page prior to the eventual TLB flush).
