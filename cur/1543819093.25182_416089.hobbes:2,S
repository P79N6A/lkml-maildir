After reading 'man 2 read' more thoroughly, I've adjusted fb_write()'s
return codes  appropriately.  Can you try this patch and let me know if it
fixes your problem.

fbdev: Fix return error of fb_write()
- return -EFBIG if file offset is past the maximum allowable offset
- return -EFBIG and write to end of framebuffer if size is bigger than the
  framebuffer length
- return -ENOSPC and write to end of framebuffer if size is bigger than the
  framebuffer length - file offset
