Having a feature flag for each power saving balance is possible but
will be an overkill since independent control of features at each
sched domain may not yield useful configurations.  The present power
saving heuristics that gets enabled at sched_mc=1 is primarily
controlled by SD_POWERSAVE_BALANCE but has side effects and can be
rendered ineffective by changing other SD flags.
We did consider having individual SD_flag for each of the power
savings functions, but that quickly lead to too many possible
configurations with most of them incorrect or ineffective.  In order
to improve the consumeability of the power saving features, we have
proposed to enhance the existing tunable with monotonically increasing
powersavings vs performance tradeoffs.  
I agree with the 'visibility' to low level interface that you have
pointed out.  It will be good to have flags showup at the low level
interface, but do end users like system administrators would want to
know and tune these flags?  It makes sense with the current set of
flags which depict important scheduler features, but power savings
related flags only further qualify or emphasise existing functions and
control points in the scheduler.  
In my opinion adding flags for each powersaving feature will add 
un-necessary complexity and may not be as useful to end users.
