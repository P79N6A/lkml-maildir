There's the bit types:
u_int8_t (unsigned char)
u_int16_t (unsigned short int)
...
int8_t (signed char)
int16_t (signed short int)
...
size_t and register_t
If I understand these correctly, size_t is the size of a pointer
(ptrdiff_t on linux?) and register_t is signed size_t.
These are common along GNU and BSD systems,
just #ifdef __BIT_TYPES_DEFINED__
For porting issues, many Win32 headers have them as now,
and for DOS16 and DOS32 they're easy.

ACK.
