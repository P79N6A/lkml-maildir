tmscsim driver should be used in 2.6. I've posted the "final" version of a
patch to this driver on linux-scsi. Kurt wanted to put it on his site for
download, so, maybe it's there. Otherwise have a look in linux-scsi
archives. It should be included in 2.6 at some point, possibly, 2.6.1...

P.S. heh, this is becomming a FAQ:-)) Looks like there are a couple more
users of this driver / chip then I initially thought:-)
