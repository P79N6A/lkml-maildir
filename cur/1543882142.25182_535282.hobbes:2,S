It's not .  And it's one of the worst interface I've seen lately.
Did anyone actually review this crap before it went in?  I completely
agree with Linus that these kind of boundaries that lead to horribly
complex ioctl interface are totally wrong.
Now suspend2 wasn't exactly nice either when I last reviewed it,
but we should probably give it another attempt if we can sort out
a proper incremental merge.
