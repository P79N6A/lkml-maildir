Then the CVS tree won't be stable, and so useless to remote people just
wanting to "cvs update" their stuff. Or am I missing something here?

I'd add the possibility to group csets into super-csets (and so on, why
not?), without ever losing the individual pieces. Masoch^Wadventurous folks
could then grovel around inside as needed. Linus' 2.5.63 --> 2.5.64 would
then just be such a super-cset, separately manipulable.
No, I have no clue of how to do this.
