This explains why setsockopt(SNDBUF) sets sk->sndbuf to twice the user
supplied number.
But IMHO
* getsockopt(SNDBUF) should return 1/2 sk->sndbuf.
* sk->sndbuf should be initialized to 2*wmem_default.

Yes.
I overlooked that when I updated the message queue code: you could kill
the computer by sending lots of 0-byte messages to a SysV message queue
