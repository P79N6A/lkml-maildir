Compact PCI specifies a max of 8 slots (one of which is typically the 
system board). Regular PCI doesn't have a hard and fast slot limit 
(except for the logical limit of 32 devices per bus); the limits are 
driven by electrical loading concerns. As I recall, a bus of typical 
length can accommodate 10 "loads", where a load is either a device 
pin or a slot connector (that is, an expansion card counts as two 
loads, one for the device and one for the connector). (I take this to 
be a rule of thumb, not a hard spec, based on the detailed electrical 
requirements in the PCI spec.)
Still, the presence of bridges opens up the number of devices on a 
root PCI bus to a very high number, logically. Certainly having three 
or four quad Ethernet cards, so 12 or 16 devices, is a plausible 
configuration. As for bandwidth, a 64x66 PCI bus has a nominal burst 
bandwidth of 533 MB/second, which would be saturated by 20 full 
duplex 100baseT ports that were themselves saturated in both 
directions (all ignoring overhead). Full saturation is not reasonable 
for either PCI or Ethernet; I'm just looking at order-of-magnitude 
numbers here.
The bottom line is: don't make any hard and fast assumption about the 
number of devices connected to a root PCI bus.
