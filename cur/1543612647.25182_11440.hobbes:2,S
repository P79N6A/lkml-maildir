Yes. I tried the entire 2.5.1-pre series:
-pre1 and -pre2 are fine.
-pre3 doesn't compile out of the box and with 3 trivial compile fixes to
      pc_keyb.c shows the problem.
So anything including and after -pre3 is broken wrt. locking.

Like I said before - it has nothing to do with Jens' bio stuff. Also the
fixes done by Andrew have nothing to do with it.
Moreover, if I back out the changes to pc_keyb.c, the problem goes away.

Udo.
