I don't know if this has come up before or not but the following config 
will
result in a non-working sound system. I have no clue how to fix it though.
CONFIG_SOUND=m
CONFIG_MODULES=y
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y
CONFIG_KMOD=y
The key here is KMOD, with that on and soundcore compiled as a module, 
upon boot the following messages get spewed to console.

Linux version 2.2.12 (root@wacko.gxsnmp.org) (gcc driver version 2.95.1 
19990816 (release) executing gcc version 2.7.2.3) #9 Mon Sep 20 18:23:58 
EDT 1999
(note! it is compiled with 2.7.2.3 even though its 2.95.1 as the compiler 
driver)
Now if the CONFIG_KMOD=n things work ok, just no autoloading of modules.
Compiling sound in works also. Don't know if this is a bug so much as a 
strange interaction in the config options.
Anyway I'm open to suggestions.
