well here are the results with the cd I burned at home and in a scsi cd rw drive:
# dd if=/dev/rdsk/c1t4d0 bs=2048 | md5sum
1569+0 records in
1569+0 records out
6a1248783a21722816b972aa9bae9d5e  -
and also with readcd but an older release:
# readcd -version
readcd 1.11a19 (hppa1.1-hp-hpux11.00) Copyright (C) 1987, 1995-2002 Jörg Schilling
# readcd dev=1,4,0 f=- | md5sum           
Capacity: 1569 Blocks = 3138 kBytes = 3 MBytes = 3 prMB
Sectorsize: 2048 Bytes
Copy from SCSI (1,4,0) disk to file '-'
end:      1569
addr:     1569 cnt: 19
Time total: 6.239sec
Read 3138.00 kB at 503.0 kB/sec.

I am very confused: cdrecord finaly do well its job on ide drive but what went
wrong for the check (cdrom drive? (but I don't have another model to test) or
some code in the kernel? (I don't think to have a small chance to put this ide
drive on a *nix system which could support ide and scsi hw)).
Any idea?
Cheers,
