Could someone explain, why we limit sk->rcvbuf from below at all?
It is very nice to have rcvbuf=0 and it means exactly, that we
do not want to receive anything.
Being useless (but still valid?) with TCP, this feature is very useful
on datagram sockets, I even used it somewhere.
So, why not to remove this check from sock.c and not to announce
that anyone setting rcvbuf to small number gets exactly the thing
which he ordered?
