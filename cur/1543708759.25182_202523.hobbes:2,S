This one is probably too large for the list, sent privately
to the usual culprits, lurkers can find it at:

<<
Bulk of the iommu rewrite.
Lots of things renamed, sillicaps killed, stuffs moved around and
common code properly extracted from implementation specific code,
new allocator, etc... The code is overall a lot simpler, faster,
less prone to fail, and a lot more manageable.
I didn't use "bk mv", there is no need to keep the old history
attached to the new file.
