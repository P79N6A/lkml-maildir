I've reproduced it on 2.5.14 while building glibc.spec. Tried using
alt-sysRq-T combination but it was only showing the request, nothing was
done after it. Note that this combination was working before hang (checked
it). Also if it might be helpful: this is part of strace ls /proc/1234 where
1234 is a pid of hanged process:
getdents64(3, /* 14 entries */, 1024) = 376
lstat64(0xbffffbc0, 0x8055a64) = 0
lstat64(0xbffffbc0, 0x8055ad8) = 0
lstat64(0xbffffbc0, 0x8055b4c) = 0
lstat64(0xbffffbc0, 0x8055bc0) = 0
lstat64(0xbffffbc0, 0x8055c34) = 0
lstat64(0xbffffbc0, 0x8055ca8) = 0
lstat64(0xbffffbc0, 0x8055d1c) = 0
lstat64(0xbffffbc0, 0x8055d90) = 0
lstat64(0xbffffbc0, 0x8055e04) = 0
lstat64(0xbffffbc0, 0x8055e78) = 0
lstat64(0xbffffbc0, 0x8055eec) = 0
readlink("cwd", "/home/users/adasi/rpm/BUILD/glibc-2.2.4/localedata", 4096)
= 50
lstat64(0xbffffbc0, 0x8055f60) = 0
readlink("root", "/", 4096) = 1
lstat64(0xbffffbc0, 0x8055fd4) = 0
readlink("exe",
And from now on it's hanged :/
