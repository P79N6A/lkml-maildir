You should probably rather move away from struct class_device and 
class_device_create() and use struct device and device_create() instead 
(all the drivers using class_device are currently being converted this 
way, so that class_device could go away), so that your driver is using the 
new kernel driver core API.
The conversion should be really very simple.
