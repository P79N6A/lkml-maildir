   How do I do it with user-mode command? If user-mode command exists,
   I'll drop this patch happily, but I was not aware of it existing. I do
   not know about screen blanking combinations on neither of my notebooks
   (neither toshiba, nor thinkpad). I could turn external display on and
   internal off, but that is not quite the same as blanking and will have
   bad side effects.
Oops.  I stand corrected.  There's an TIOCLINUX ioctl for unblanking the
screen, but not for blanking the screen.  There should be, though.  :-)
Maybe that would be the better patch....
