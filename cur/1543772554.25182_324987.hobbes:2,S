This case is interesting, but it will be resolved in two possible ways :
1) no firewall in front of A
  - C spoofs A and sends a fake SYN to B
  - B responds to A with a SYN-ACK
  - A sends an RST to B, which clears the session
  - A wants to connect and sends its SYN to B which accepts it.
2) A behind a firewall
  - C spoofs A and sends a fake SYN to B
  - B responds to A with a SYN-ACK, which does not reach A (firewall, etc...)
  - A tries to connect to B and sends its SYN with a different SEQ
  - B responds to A with only an ACK (no SYN) indicating the expected SEQ.
  - A responds to B's ACK with an RST and B flushes its session too.
  - A resends its SYN to B which accepts it.
Cheers,
Willy
