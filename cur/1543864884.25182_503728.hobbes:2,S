So what was the motivation for doing this then?  It's only point 
is to have smaller startup costs for AIO than clone+fork without
fixing the VFS code to be a state machine, right? 
I'm personally unclear if it's really less work to teach a lot of 
code in the kernel about a new thread abstraction than changing VFS.
Your patches don't look that complicated yet but you openly
admitted you waved away many of the more tricky issues (like 
signals etc.) and I bet there are yet-unknown side effects
of this too that will need more changes.
I would expect a VFS solution to be the fastest of any at least.
I'm not sure the fibrils thing will be that much faster than
a possibly somewhat fast pathed for this case clone+syscall+exit.
