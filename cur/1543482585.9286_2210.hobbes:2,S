The deadlock is simple:
1. Two processes has read locks.
2. Both want to upgrade to write lock.
3. Both wait forever for this, as the other aren't going to release
   the read lock until it has finished using the write
   lock it doesn't get.

Exactly, and this solves the problem outlined above, like this:
1. Two both processes have read locks
2. Both want the write lock
3. Both release the read locks
4. Both tries to grab the write lock
5. One gets the write lock, the other is forced to wait
   until number one release it again.  No deadlock.
You could have an upgradeable non-deadlocking lock if you make
the upgrade mechanism drop the read lock when some other process
also is trying to upgrade.  This hovewer is unnecessary complication,
and it is dangerous because it isn't natural to assume that
the upgrade option might drop the lock letting another process
mess with the data in the meantime.
