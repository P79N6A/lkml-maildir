The transfers are each longer in the TSO case, so need more
to transfer more data from the bus just to get _one_ of
the sub-packets of the large TSO frame out.  It thus makes it
more likely they'll be a delay.

No, I mean "bypass L2 cache on miss" for stores.  Don't
tell me IA64 doesn't have that? 8) I certainly didn't mean
"always bypass L2 cache" for stores :-)
