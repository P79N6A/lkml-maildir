Nope. The instruction is not being used. However, there are a lot
of coprocessor instructions and if any of these are encountered
before the emulator handler is in place, I'm in trouble. The '486
doesn't have a coprocessor.

Same source-code.

I tried with both 'C' compilers.

Right.

Penguin : Linux version 2.3.13 on an i686 machine (400.59 BogoMips).
