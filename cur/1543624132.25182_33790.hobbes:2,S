Come on, Tom, truth in advertising.  If you don't have the file identifier 
in the file, what you just described doesn't work.
Arch has a concept of an "inode" quite similar to BitKeeper, in fact
one wonders where the idea came from :-), and as long as the the "inode"
is embedded in the file, you can do what Tom says above.  If it isn't,
that won't work, no matter what he says.  I speak from the experience
of importing lots of kernel versions into BK and trying to automate the
detection of renames.  Can't be done and if Tom claims it can, then 
ask him to demonstrate how by taking a a few thousand kernel patches
and autodetecting the renames.
