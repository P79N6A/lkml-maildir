Hi Greg, what patches specifically have problems ? Paul is just back
from vacation and we are trying to catch up with merging the tons of
pending powerpc stuffs, but we have a couple of requirements with things
in this list, notably my small export of pci_cfg_space_size() which
should be trivial, but also Linas error recovery stuff... So if one of
these is causing problems, we need to know right now as it means we have
to rebase.
Thanks,
Ben.
