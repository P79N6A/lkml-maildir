We want the check to fail to detect mis-programmed eeproms.  The
checksum test isn't conclusive, but it does provide an indication
something is wrong.

The assumption is that the eeprom was programmed correctly in
manufacturing, so your nics were 1) mis-programmed during manufacturing,
or 2) modified later using some tool.  Follow-up with
linux.nics@intel.com to make sure 1) isn't the case.
