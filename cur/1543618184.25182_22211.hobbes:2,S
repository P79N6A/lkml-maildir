kernel.org is back online, and is now wired for proper remote
management so we hopefully should avoid these problems in the future.
I have also gotten a fair number of offers for a second-server site; I
will need some time to sort through them all figure out which one is
best for us.  In general, my preference is for another site which
looks as much as possible like the existing one, i.e. a dedicated
server, preferrably of the same type.
