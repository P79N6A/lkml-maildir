No, that implication had never really occurred to me before either.
But when you said "caches the file twice" it suddenly made sense.
With subtree_check, the NFS file handle contains information about the
directory, and NFS uses the filehandle as the primary key to tell if
two things are the same or not.
Trond keeps prodding me to make no_subtree_check the default.  Maybe it
is time that I actually did....
