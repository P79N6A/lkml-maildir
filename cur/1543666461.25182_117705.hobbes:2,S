Come to think of it, using any of the bitops generates unoptimized code
for cpu mask testing when we know that NR_CPUS will fit into a single
long.  For NR_CPUS <= 8*sizeof(long), using mask & (1UL << cpu) removes
the unnecessary array calculations.

I could tell you, but then marketing would kill me :(  Wait a bit.

Keep the optimized model, where cpu_online_map is #defined to 1 for UP.
Changing it to an ADT just to get type checking on architectures that
only support UP looks like a bad tradeoff.
