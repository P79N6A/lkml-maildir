Ok, that one is line 295 in io_apic.c. It bombs in 2.4.21-pre{2,3}
because mp_bus_id_to_pci_bus was changed from a static array to
a dynamically allocated array. On your machine, smp_read_mpc() in
mpparse.c doesn't get to the point where it allocates that array,
so the array is NULL in io_apic.c and you get an oops.
Fixing the oops is easy (see below), but the real problem is
that 2.4.21-pre2 apparently broke MP table parsing on your HW.
I suggest you sprinkle tracing printk()s in setup/smpboot/mpparse
and compare 2.4.20 (good) and later (bad) to see where things
start to diverge.
