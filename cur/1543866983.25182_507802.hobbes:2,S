Are you sure this is a useful optimization? Do you have numbers vs open+aio_sendfile+close? 
Compared to the cost of sending a complete file three system calls should be quite in the noise. 
And Linux system calls are not that expensive (few hundred cycles normally) 
Adding such compound system calls would be a worrying precedent because
I'm sure others would want them then for their favourite system call combo
too. If they were really useful it might make more sense to have a batch() 
system call that works for arbitary calls, but I'm not convinced yet
it's even needed. It would be certainly ugly.
