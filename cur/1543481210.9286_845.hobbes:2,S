One thing: "goto" is really the only sane way in C to implement a
so-called posit/admit structure, which *is* recognized by structural
programming -- you assume that it is going to be OK, but need to do
cleanup if you bail.  Sometimes an early return or "return do_cleanup();"
is acceptable, but if the function needs to do cleanup using local
variables, then there is no real choice.
