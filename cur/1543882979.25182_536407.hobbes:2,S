(1) can be done without extra locking.  Device-mapper already has  
code to freeze filesystems and that makes a natural process-stopping  
point.  Any threads doing IO will very quickly put themselves to  
sleep at (1) and save us some effort during step 2.

If the image can't be saved then there are 2 options:
   (1)  Call sys_restore() with the image
   (2)  Pass your snapshot file-descriptor to sys_unsnapshot()
In the former case, the system will be restored to the state it was  
at a few seconds earlier, right as it took the snapshot.  In the  
latter case the modified-in-memory snapshot pages will be synced back  
to the disk filesystems, the copy-on-write data-structures torn down  
(think of merging an LVM snapshot back into its base device), and the  
memory allocated for the snapshot will be freed.  Either way the  
system is properly in sync with disk again, the only difference is  
whether you want to preserve the userspace state from during the  
attempted snapshot (IE: any error status).  You could also save the  
error state in case (1) by just auto-posting a bug-report on http:// 
bugs.$VENDOR.com/ of course :-D.
