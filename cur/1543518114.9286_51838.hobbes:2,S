While I agree this is a good workaround, I'd like to note that my
keyboard will miss the first repeat as a result of this patch, because
when my keyboard is set to a 250 ms delay before the first repeat, it
actually only takes about 242 ms.  There is then a 33 ms before the next
repeat, which I may throw off my judgement enough to make things annoying
for me.
I am sure that there are other keyboards with even less of a delay that
people are used to, and perhaps some that can be set to even less for the
initial delay.  This patch doesn't have any option to support these, but
I don't see any easy alternative (easiest thing is probably a config
option, which is pretty silly).
Attached is a happy delay test program, enter key only.  You may wish to
clear the screen first (especially in an X terminal or framebuffer), to
reduce console overhead.
Output from my keyboard:
0.242143
0.033059
0.033039
0.033066
