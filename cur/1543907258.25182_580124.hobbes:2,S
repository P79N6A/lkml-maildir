The binary blob is run in the kernel.  I wasn't aware of any
completely open-source drivers for ADSL modems, mine is a PCI ADSL
modem.  I have been referred to the BeWAN PCI driver as a guide for
conforming to GPL, but they use a binary library as well.

My company has been given documentation and the library source under
the terms of an NDA with the chipset manufacturer.  We are permitted
to compile the library and distribute the resultant binary blob, but
not release the source to the library.
The binary blob is linked into the driver we have written.  We don't
distribute this compiled module, customers are given the driver source
and the library blob, which they compile themselves.
Thanks for the help.
