Is this patch allready included in the 2.6.13-rc6-git1 patch ?
I compiled/installed that kernel now over 6 hours ago
reboot   system boot  2.6.13-rc6-git1  Wed Aug 10 13:24          (06:04)
Prior to that 2.6.13-rc6 crashed on me twice:
reboot   system boot  2.6.13-rc6       Mon Aug  8 16:52 (1+20:29)
reboot   system boot  2.6.13-rc6       Sun Aug  7 22:07 (2+15:14)
Although it managed to receive 1.8 and sent 3.6TB in 24 hours!
