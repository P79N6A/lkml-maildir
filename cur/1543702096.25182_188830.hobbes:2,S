Looks like your libc has 2.6 kernel headers.  I refer you to my
previous answer:
You are compiling against 2.6 kernel headers.
(Most people have 2.4 kernel headers in
/usr/include/linux, even if they are running a
2.6 kernel).  You will need to update the
firmware_loader directory.  Do the following:
        cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.speedtouch.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/speedtouch login
(just hit return if asked for a password).  Then do
        cvs -z 9 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.speedtouch.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/speedtouch co speedtouch
This creates a directory called speedtouch.  Replace the contents of the
firmware_loader directory with the contents of this new speedtouch
directory.  Now rebuild: in the top level of the speedbundle do
        make clean
        make
(become root)
        make install

Remove the speedtch.o file in
/lib/modules/(kernelversion)/kernel/drivers/usb
Ciao,
