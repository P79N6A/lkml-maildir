It depends on the meaning of graphics :
If it is direct card access, then kernel job.
If it is higher level like window system etc, then it
can be discussed...

Unix was not designed for graphics.

Is X so stable and performant ?
For instance, X is not precise enough to make
compatible implementations.
X.free and X.org are not compatible.
Some graphic drivers work only with special versions
of X.org.
Gnome and KDE are not compatible.
etc.
Other example : can X follow new graphic progress ?
>but then there is no reason to stick it in the
kernel.
Usual reasons : Reusability, portability, ease of
maintenance, speed, etc.
What do you think of solutions using framebuffers like
directfb or fbui ?
It is in the kernel, the hardw access is direct, it is
fast and stable.
Why X.Org puts so many layers between the hardware and
the screen ? It adds complexity and slowness to the
project.
I think the discussion should move to X.Org ?
