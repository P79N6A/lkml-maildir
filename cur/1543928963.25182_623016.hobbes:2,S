I wrote a small program to talk to ptrace and look at the trace of small
sample programs to test the patch. I do this on P4 32bit and Core2
64bit.
Our debugger team has a prototype implementation for their debugger. But
that will not be available for some time.
I hope that we get gdb support, soon, but that would take a while 
if I had to do it.

I added a ptrace command to query for the maximal buffer size and moved
the macro to ptrace_bts.h.
I am not sure how much flexibility is actually needed, here. I would
expect
the trace to be very useful near its tail, but unmanageable when it gets
too big.
I would rather add flexibility when and where it is needed.
regards,
markus.
