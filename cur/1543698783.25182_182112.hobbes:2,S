Problem being that user space programs are not supposed to use the kernel 
headers - they're supposed to use the glibc headers anyway.  In fact the 
latest kernel source headers don't work in userspace period.  And the user 
space glibc 'kernel' headers are released and distributed seperately and 
contain much less code than the actual kernel kernel headers.
