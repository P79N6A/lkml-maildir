Yes, have a look at the work of the Click Modular Router PPL from MIT,
having a Polling Router Module Implementatin which outperforms Linux Kernel
Routing by far (according to their paper :)
You can find the Link to Click somewhere on my Page:
http://www.freefire.org/tools/index.en.php3in
 the Operating System section
(i think)
I can recommend the click-paper.pdf
