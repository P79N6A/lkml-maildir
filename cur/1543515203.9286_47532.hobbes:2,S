The kiobuf mechanism may be the way to go but it (or associated
bits of the kernel) has some rough edges. Stephen Tweedie seems
to be very busy so perhaps someone else could look at some of
these points:
1) If a driver has 2 or more pointers to the user space (e.g.
   iovec scatter gather mechanism) then the second call to
   map_user_kiobuf runs the risk of hanging forever if it
   presents a range containing a page that the first call
   to map_user_kiobuf has already locked. [I think 
   map_user_kiobuf should have a variant to return EBUSY
   rather than always wait for the page in question to free
   up. Could it determine that the current kernel thread is
   holding that page and so _not_ wait on it?]
2) If a character driver plans to call unmap_kiobuf in its
   release() call then it may never get a chance. Linux
   seems to freeze the process due to locked pages _before_
   it closes down file descriptors. This situation occurs when
   SIGINT hits a process. A side affect of this is that the driver
   will not release other resources and, if it is a module, will 
   not unload.
3) As of 2.3.21 (I'm yet to try this on 2.3.25) trying to use
   unmap_kiobuf() in a bh handler results in a "BUG" oops. BTW
   This was an attempted work-around of point 2.
4) As of 2.3.25 map_user_kiobuf() and unmap_kiobuf() are not
   exported symbols in kernel/ksyms.c making them difficult to
   access from a module.
So the kiobuf mechanism may be sufficient for the "raw"
character device but it needs more work (and documentation)
before other driver writers are encouraged to use it.
