Subject: [PATCH] reserved buffers only for PF_MEMALLOC
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/10/260

The buffer allocation path in 2.4 has a long standing bug,
where non-PF_MEMALLOC tasks can dig into the reserved pool
in get_unused_buffer_head().  The following patch makes the
reserved pool only accessible to PF_MEMALLOC tasks.
Other processes will loop in create_buffers() - the only
function that calls get_unused_buffer_head() - and will call
try_to_free_pages(GFP_NOIO), freeing any buffer heads that
have become freeable due to IO completion.
Note that PF_MEMALLOC tasks will NOT do anything inside
try_to_free_pages(), so it is needed that they are able to
dig into the reserved buffer heads while other tasks are
not.
