I would actually disagree.  I have systems with multiport serial cards 
installed, and I much prefer those to be named differently.  Not only do 
I not have to worry about the same problem I *constantly* have with 
onboard Ethernet cards -- whoops I just installed an expansion card and 
suddenly my onboard NIC is eth2! -- but the expansion serial ports tend 
to be *different.*
For example, on my serial server, the Cyclades ports (ttyC*) use RJ-45 
connections from an external expansion module, whereas of course the 
builtin ones (ttyS*) use DB-9s.
