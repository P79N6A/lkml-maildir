   Linux happened to process invalid ND messages with invalid options
   such as
    - length of ND options is 0
    - length of ND options is not enough
   Specification says that such messages must be silently discarded.
   This patch parses/checks ND options before it changes state of
   neighbour / address etc. and ignores such messages.
   Following patch is against linux-2.4.19.
Patch applied to 2.4.x and 2.5.x, thanks a lot.
Let us hope more patches like this one are coming :-)
