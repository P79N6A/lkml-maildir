What exactly is needed to get got SATA and PATA support
comparable to the driver provided by promise?  Would it be
possible to adapt the existing promise PATA IDE driver to drive
the PATA port, while the libata Promise driver handles the SATA
ports.  Or would a new driver be needed?
How would the two drivers share the same PCI device?
