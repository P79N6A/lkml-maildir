I'm not so sure.
Most of the block allocation (and pre-allocation) code is actually of
necessity going to be filesystem specific.  There are patches
currently in the ext4 patch queue which would provide a
filesystem-generic preallocate system call, and that makes sense.  And
delayed allocation could be done more in the VM --- but the actual
reservation code?  It's not at all clear it makes sense to try to
generalize it, since filesystems like XFS which look up free blocks
via extents have fundamentally different abstractions which would be
more efficient for them.

What patterns do you think means things like "this file is likely to
be deleted immediate", or "this file will grow pretty big"?  I don't
think there are any that would be generally valid.
The only thing which I think makes sense is to delayed allocation,
which as I said part of which could be done in the VM/VFS layer, and
an explicit API for large files that need to persistent preallocation.
