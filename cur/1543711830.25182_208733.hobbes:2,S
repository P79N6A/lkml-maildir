I have a patch for that too which I have been testing for DoS in
route cache, not latency. It is worth testing it here, however 
I think re-arming tasklets is not as friendly to latency as
executing the rcu callbacks from process context. One thing
I have noticed is that more softirqs worsen latency irrespective
of the worst-case softirq length.
Thanks
