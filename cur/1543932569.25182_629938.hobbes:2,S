Mmm.. that's a programmers' man page, not a user/admin page.
Something in mv(1) would be very useful to have.
And perhaps a mount flag to select desired behaviour,
since virtually everyone expects it to "just work" that way,
and it doesn't.
I'll happily generate a patch if we can agree on the correctness
of the sample patch I posted earlier, plus a suitable mount flag name.
Cheers
