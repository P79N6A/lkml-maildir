Since the problem isn't reproducible on the pwc-camera on the onboard
UHCI controller, I tend to think it isn't a problem with the PWC driver
but with either the hardware or the usb-ohci driver. If 3 out of four
cameras has the same problem, and the fourth doesn't the problem is
easiest to find if you look at the difference between them, the UHCI
vs OHCI controller/drivers.
And I think he is subscribed to this list. I don't want to bother him to
much since he has gotten tons of bugreports that has turned out to be
bugs in uhci.o, usb-uhci.o and usb-ohci.o over the last year.
