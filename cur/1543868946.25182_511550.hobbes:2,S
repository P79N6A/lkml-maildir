OK, but this change was needed because the new IRQ-debugging code reliably
causes e1000 to explode.
So perhaps until e1000 gets sorted out we should disable the debug code:
--- a/lib/Kconfig.debug~a
+++ a/lib/Kconfig.debug
@@ -79,7 +79,7 @@ config DEBUG_KERNEL
 
 config DEBUG_SHIRQ
 	bool "Debug shared IRQ handlers"
-	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && GENERIC_HARDIRQS
+	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && GENERIC_HARDIRQS && BROKEN
 	help
 	  Enable this to generate a spurious interrupt as soon as a shared
 	  interrupt handler is registered, and just before one is deregistered.
