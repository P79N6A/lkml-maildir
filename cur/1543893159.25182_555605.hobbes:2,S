well, dmesg (/var/log/messages) is around 35MB :) Even bz2 compressed it is 
over 700KB. I put it here: 
http://dump.ru:80/loadfile.php?filename=fir_acpi_debug.bz2&id=379192
 
This is from /var/log/messages. I do not have serial console and cannot 
capture output directly; I can only hope nothing is lost at this rate.
