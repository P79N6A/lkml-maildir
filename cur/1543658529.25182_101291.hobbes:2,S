Subject: [BUG - HRT patch] nanosleep returns 0 on failure

George -
In the latest 2.5.54-bk1 high-res-timers patches, it appears that
nanosleep() is returning 0 (success) and not setting errno when an rqtp
argument is sent that specifies a nsec value < 0 or >= 1000 million.  In
this instance, the POSIX System Interfaces doc states that errno is supposed
to be set to EINVAL, and nanosleep should return -1.
In the 2.5.50 high-res-timers patches, behavior was as expected (i.e.,
returned -1 and set errno=EINVAL).  Unfortunately, I haven't looked at any
patches since then to know exactly which patch stopped behaving as expected.
A plain 2.5.54-bk1 kernel also behaves as expected (returns -1, sets
errno=EINVAL).
The tests I am using to reproduce this issue are part of the POSIX Test
Suite at 
http://posixtest.sf.net
 under
posixtestsuite/conformance/interfaces/nanosleep.  5-1.c (sending -1 nsec),
6-1.c (sending multiple nsec values < 0 and >= 1,000 million), and 10000-1.c
(sending other nsec values < 0 and >= 1,000 million) are failing.  I've
included 5-1.c below.
Additional information is below:
kernel used = 2.5.54-bk1
HRT patches applied = 
 hrtimers-core-2.5.54-bk1-1.0.patch

Thanks.
