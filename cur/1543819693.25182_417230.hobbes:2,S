The worst security is that which doesn't do what it claims to do, giving
a false sense of security.  Which is precisely the problem with
path-based access control; it makes the user think that he is protecting
a given object, when in fact the object may be accessible by another
means.

Multiple instances of the same program can't be distinguished?

So you have an unbounded number of policies that can govern access to
any given file object and the enforcement of the system policy is
entirely dependent on the file tree structure and any process that can
manipulate that structure.  Further, what about runtime files generated
in shared directories like /tmp, /var/run, ...  And let's please
separate user interface from kernel mechanism.  If you want to specify
pathnames for fixed resources in a user-level config file, that is fine,
but pathnames have historically been rejected as a suitable basis for
the kernel for a reason, not just in the security space.  Why should
this change?  Isn't this a fundamental design change to Linux?

Not sure what is meant by "subvert AppArmor" here.  Bypass is certainly
possible.

So the attacker knows precisely how to bypass it.  The attacker (beyond
the script kiddies) isn't going to attack you at the point of strength;
he will attack you where you are known to be weak.

Except that your internal unconfined programs/processes may nonetheless
be subverted via the confined program, because:
a) you aren't controlling all objects and operations, and
b) you aren't controlling those internal programs/processes at all, so
they are at risk of taking untrustworthy inputs from the "confined"
ones, and
c) there is a high likelihood of interactions between those
processes/programs in any real system, particularly in shared
directories where paths aren't very useful as a distinguisher.

Introduce new hooks at the proper location where the information is available.
