All processes on arm26 must map the same page 0 as its where the SWI 
vector table goes. The vector table is located at address 0, and as such 
becomes virtual address space once the MMU is switched on. This is 
unavoidable, unlike later ARMs which can remap it elsewhere.
The only way this could work is if you do the zeroing with all 
interrupts off and restore page 0 afterwards, which seems rather silly 
to me.
