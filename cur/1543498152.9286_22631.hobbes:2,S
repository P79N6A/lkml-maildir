You have the completely wrong idea what a device driver is!  XF86_SVGA
is a device driver!  gpm is a device driver (mouse driver.) 
magicfilter/ghostscript is a device driver (printer driver.)  Neither
belong in the kernel.
Things belong in the kernel if they *have* to be there.  Not otherwise. 
This implies the need for a coherent, *USER SPACE*, setup for managing
devices.  Bootup devices are somewhat a special case, of course, but
that doesn't change the fundamentals.

The whole design philosophy behind this.  "Throw all the crap in the
kernel, it's the easy solution."
