I think that should be -EEXIST.

Okay, the arch implementations of ptep_test_and_clear_young say
Christoph is right: the preliminary pte_young test should be buried
in there (in the SMP cases as in the UP cases), not out in rmap.c.
(Just in case anyone is in doubt, I'm absolutely not proposing a
preliminary pte_dirty test in the SMP ptep_test_and_clear_dirty.)
I'll leave it for now: it's much better dealt with when we get to
doing the (much more important) TLB flush after clearing young.
Andrew, please just ignore rmap 25 (billed as 24) "pte_young first".
Hugh
