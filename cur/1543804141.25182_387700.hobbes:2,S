Hum, I don't think so (but maybe someone else knows for sure), I thought
that driver was specifically for a certain kind of IBM server, not an
IBM laptop.  It looks like from this output that the acpiphp is not
recognizing any hotplug capable devices on your laptop.  I believe that
this is defined by acpiphp as a slot which is "ejectable", meaning
contains an ACPI method called _EJ0.  I think we should take a look at
your dsdt to make sure that it seems reasonable, and also perhaps you
could send the output of lspci -vv -x with the laptop booted in the dock
just to see what kind of dock bridge you have and make sure everything
seems like it should work.  Please send the disassembled output of your
dsdt - if you've never done it before, instructions for doing this can
be found here:

thanks!
