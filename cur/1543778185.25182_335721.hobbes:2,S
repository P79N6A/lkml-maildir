I submit that sparse switch jump table's are not an "unusual" construct in
the Linux kernel/drivers.  GCC only creates a table large enough to cover
the largest of the sparse values - it doesn't have to be 0...255.  0...60
with 10 values sparsely scattered would generate a 61 element jump table.
There's many K of locked memory in these sparse jump tables.  About 2K worth
in the VT102 code alone.
