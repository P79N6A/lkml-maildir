Thanks for the pointer! Hmm.  That patch is very similar to what I'm
trying to avoid. 
Just to be clear for everyone else, that commit id is for Linus' git
tree. The patch I'm proposing is against the -rt tree, where the
run_posix_timers() function has been converted to a kthread instead of
being run from the timer interrupt context.
This allows the possibility of the the run_posix_timers_thread racing
against the task its running on behalf and the task exiting, and I hope
that is what my patch resolves (although I'm not confident its 100%).
The tsk->signal check from the patch above looks like it would avoid
this as well. Is there a specific benefit to checking that over
exit_state?
If anyone has further feedback or info about why the above was reverted
it would be appreciated.
thanks
