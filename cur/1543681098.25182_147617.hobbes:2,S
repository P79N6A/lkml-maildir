1.4Ghz Athlon via 82cxx chipset, software raid 1 scsi drives, currently 
running 2.4.21
With 2.5.73/74/75(the only ones I've tried thus far) the kernel boots fine 
until it tries to mount the reiserfs partition on the raid1 set.  Replaying 
the journal takes many times longer than with 2.4.  Once it gets past that 
point the whole machine appears to be quite sluggish.  Is this a known issue 
with reiserfs + software raid 1?  What information would be useful to aid in 
debugging?
I have smp disabled, preemption enabled, tried with generic x86 
disabled/enabled.
Thanks,
Chris
