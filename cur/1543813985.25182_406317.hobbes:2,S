It's less code:
static inline unsigned round(unsigned x)
{
	return x % N;
}
add()
{
	buf[round(tail++)] = item;
}
remove()
{
	return buf[round(head++)];
}
num_in_buffer()
{
	return tail - head;
}
Not terribly important though.

Well yes ;)
But what are the implications of this mask on 64-bit platforms?

If that's semantically what the 0xffffffff means then yes.

The way you have the code here the compiler will need to create an array on
the stack and then populate each item in that array each time it's used.
If these are made static, that's all done at compile time.

readl() should already take care of all that.

In that case something funny is going on.  We should understand what that
is - it'll come back to bite us.
