Some driver (at least one) also needs to know of the actual PCI base
address values, since the chip may have to be provided with actual PCI BUS
address in order to access its internal memory from SCRIPTS (8XX) or from
some equivalent stuff. That does not mean that the chip will use PCI
cycles, but just that it will uses the _actual_ PCI address window for
address comparison to decide what memory to access. 
The address values provided in the pcidev structure qualified as 'suitable
for ioremap()' looks rather a bad hack than a clean abstraction to me and
it is not enough for all drivers to be portable. A driver needs some
handle to access the device and, as I just wrote twice:), may also need
the _actual_ configured PCI base addresses, but does not care of your
obscure cookie that just make sense as input of some kernel routine. 
All this stuff is to be redesigned for 2.3/4, in my opinion.

It may be now, but it must be changed in the future. It hides the reality
in a stupid way, in my opinion.  The right way to go is to tell the kernel
with the parameters that correspond to the reality.
A PCI device driver want to tell the kernel:
- Give me some MMIO handle to access this configured PCI BUS address range
  on that PCI BUS, but I donnot care of how you will proceed for it.
Instead of that, you tell the driver:
- Provide ioremap() with some right-cooked address value supplied in the
  pcidev structure and you will get some address-typed value to access the
  device.
