    Hi all :)
    I mean, the field 'i_ino' in the 'struct inode' field contained
in the 'struct socket' field of the 'struct tcp_opt' structure, shown
as field number 10 in each entry of /proc/net/tcp. Moreover, this
inode number doesn't seem to be associated with any block device,
maybe is a fake inode number?
