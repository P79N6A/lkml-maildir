In fact, there is a (IIRC single) byte changed in the hostbridge's config
space after resume. Blindly writing back the old value re-enables access
to the cardbus memory resource below 1M. But I agree solving the real
cause (i.e. bogus mapping to legacy area) is better then trying to cure
whatever triggers the problem with that.

IIRC there was some discussion on l-k some time ago, whether such fixups
should stay close to were the issue appeared or better be placed at
generic pci quirk location. In this particular case I personally tend to
the latter one as well, particularly because there may be other BIOS'
doing similar things with non-cardbus memory bar's.
The patch however was simply what I'm using since 2.4.0 just in case the
cardbus-specific fixup would be the prefered way.
