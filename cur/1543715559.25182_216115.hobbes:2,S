Thanks for this report, and sorry for the late answer.
drivers/net/irda/tekram.c uses irda_task_delete, but this function is 
not EXPORT_SYMBOL'ed in net/irda/irda_device.c .
The most simple solution would be to change TEKRAM_DONGLE_OLD to be a 
bool (as does the patch below), but perhaps the IrDA people know a 
better solution.
