And thanks for the further info you sent, which allowed me to rebuild my
kernel to reproduce the problem easily with artsd.  Though the answer was
staring me in the face from the first info you sent (and did occasionally
flit through my mind without being properly swatted), even in my Subject
line above: why were the page flags 0x414 instead of 0x4414 i.e. what had
happened to the PageCompound flag which I thought one of my patches was
adding?
Whoops, I'd completely missed that now we have to pass __GFP_COMP to
turn on that behaviour, because there are or were a few other places
which get confused by compound page behaviour.  There's an excellent,
illuminating, prescient comment on compound pages by Andrew in
ChangeLog-2.6.6: but though he there foresees sound DMA buffers needing
it, I've a suspicion that DRM and some others might also be needing it.
So I'll go on a trawl through the source before finalizing the fix,
but below is the patch you guys need.  Does this patch deal with your
Bad page states too, Marc?  Does it help your mouse at all somehow?
