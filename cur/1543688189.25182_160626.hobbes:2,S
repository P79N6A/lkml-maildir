Subject: NFS regression since 2.6.0-test3 (in -test4 and 4-mm1)

Transfer time doubled and kernel log is swelling...
Remote is exported rw,no_root_squash and runs a Slackware 7.1.0
(Universal NFS Server 2.2beta47) kernel 2.2.16. Mounted here with a
simple "-t nfs". Both remote and local is ext2.
_2.6.0-test3_
"cp -a" the remote /etc directory takes 2 minutes. /var/log/kernel says:
Aug 27 03:59:59 loke kernel: eth0: media is TP.
Aug 27 04:02:34 loke kernel: nfs warning: mount version older than
kernel
Duh! I'm using your util-linux-2.12pre.tar.gz so stop complaining.
_2.6.0-test4 and -mm1_
The transfer takes 4 minutes and log is filled with:
Aug 27 04:20:47 loke kernel: eth0: media is TP.
Aug 27 04:22:34 loke kernel: nfs warning: mount version older than
kernel
Aug 27 04:23:21 loke kernel: nfs: server oden.fish.net not
responding, still trying
Aug 27 04:23:41 loke kernel: nfs: server oden.fish.net OK

[Lots of lines deleted]
Aug 27 04:27:00 loke kernel: nfs: server oden.fish.net OK
Aug 27 04:27:01 loke kernel: nfs: server oden.fish.net not responding,
still trying
Aug 27 04:27:01 loke kernel: nfs: server oden.fish.net OK
Last night the complete backup took 9 hours (transfer of 1.2 gig).
That's why I noticed the issue.
