Oops. I was thinking of the problems with latency when you cat a big file
to a tty. Especially with a fbdev driver. As for the interrupt latency. I
will have to work on that.

   Oh its quite a challenge. Everytime I think I solved a problem I
discover another limitation of the console system. The code is very old
and is completely designed around the idea of the VGA text mode hardware.
Now that linux supports many kinds of hardware it was a matter of
rethinking the abstracting of the console system. Especially if we want to
take advantage of the video hardware we have today. It is not that much of
a leap tho. 
   What is even worst is the whole vidoe subsystem. We have DRI/fbdv and
v4l all running independent of each other but yet each subsystem can have
a impact on other apps using the other 2 subsystems. Then we have the
console angle. So when thinking about the console design I have to take in
consideration the other video subsystems of linux as well. What a job but
it is well worth it.

Thanks. It should be another month before it is really ready for mass
testing.
