Are you so sure? 2x SMP on intel means about 30% performance increase,
if you are lucky. SMP on intel can even _slow you down_ for certain
kind of loads, and web server may be exactly this kind of load.

Try running UP kernel on that Pentium II-400 machine. If single cpu
can not handle the load, don't expect 2 cpu's to handle loads in
stable way.
BTW it is _web server_. Why don't you do congestion control? Don't try
to handle any new requests if load is above 20. That is probably the
right way. TCP stacks will retransmit their connection requests, and
things will slow down, but machine will stay alive.
