Hi Michael,
I booted test7-pre5 via syslinux-1.44 with a minimal initrd.gz today.
Can't do much with kernel and initrd on a floppy, but she mounted
/dev/ram0 just fine.  I do not have devfs compiled into this kernel..
nor any idea how to use it properly if I _did_ enable it ;-).
syslinux.cfg:
label linux
kernel bzimage
append root=/dev/ram0 initrd=initrd.gz init=/bin/sash
	-Mike
