it's only used in the error path AFAICS.
but you are right about evserver_epoll/kevent.c incorrectly assuming 
that things wont block in evtest_callback_client(), which, after 
receiving the "there's stuff on the input socket" event does:
	recvmsg(sock),
	fd = open();
	sendfile(sock, fd)
	close(fd);
while evserver_threadlet.c, even this naive implementation, does not 
assume that we wont block in that function.

fully agreed.
