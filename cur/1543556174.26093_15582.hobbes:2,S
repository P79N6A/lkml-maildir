Hi,
I have the following soundcard in my ToshibaDynabook(db45) model of
laptop.
Acer Laboratories Inc. [ALi]|M5451 PCI South Bridge Audio
(MULTIMEDIA_AUDIO unknown) SubVendor=0x1179 SubDevice=0x0003
Till the date, I was using 2.2.16kernel typically compiled for RH7. To
enable the sound card, I was doing the following
	modprobe soundcore
	modprobe soundlow
	modprobe sound
	modprobe ac97_codec
	modprobe trident
This worked fine.
But I am facing problem from the time, I have upgraded the m/c to
2.2.17-21 kernel in Mandrake7.2 Whenever I am doing the above, m/c
hangs. I tried to use the natively compiled code of trident in 2.2.17
kernel, but again, the kernel freezes while booting. I have not tested
the trident driver for 2.4 kernel. Can anyone please help me??
