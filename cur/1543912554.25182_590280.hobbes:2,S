The reason I suspected DMA support is because I noticed the description 
of DMACK- (DMA acknowledge) and DMARQ (DMA request).

What I fear is that programmed I/O will tie up the CPU and add 
non-deterministic latency to my real-time apps.
Suppose that an app is waiting for an acknowledgement from a PCI device 
when the OS suddenly decides it is time to write 4 KB to disk. Typical 
write rate is quoted as 1.2 MB/s i.e. the write would require at least 
3.4 ms to complete.
My fear is that the entire transfer is done in a non-preemptible 
critical section. In other words, my real-time app would be delayed 
several milliseconds, which is unacceptable.
Am I mistaken?
Regards.
