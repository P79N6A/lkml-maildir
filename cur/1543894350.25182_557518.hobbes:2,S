Hmm...  So, if someone takes one of the many GPLv2+ contributions and
makes improvements under GPLv3+, you're going to make an effort to
accept them, rather than rejecting them because they're under the
GPLv3?

I understand.  I assumed you had some trust that people would abide by
your wish to permit TiVOization, and that authors of modifications
were entitled to make "whatever restrictions they wanted" on their
code.
Pardon me if I think your position is at least somewhat incoherent.
Can you help me make sense of it?
