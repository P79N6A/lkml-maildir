Subject: No proper shutdown after kernel 2.6.13-rc2

Hello list,
this is an old issue, I reported it to 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5410
 in 2005, but it still 
bothers me. My mouse light (simple Logitech USB mouse) still stays on 
after shutdown with 2.6.21-rc7.
But, headway has been made (a little). It turned out that I don't have a 
jumper on my motherboard that would explain this behaviour (e.g. 
PS2_USB_PWR). Then there's MS Windows which manages to shut off the 
mouse light when it shuts down.
Last but not least I finally managed to find the commit which triggered 
the issue back in 2.6.13-rc2:

    [PATCH] USB: fix ohci merge glitch
    A patch re-organizing some parts of root hub initialization deleted 
the
    code initializing the bus-neutral reboot/shutdown notifier for OHCI.
    This patch just restores that deleted code.

I'd really appreciate if someone could attend to this.
Thanks!
