It can be either, but the former can only be the result of a problem
(either hardware fault or a data-corrupting software bug of some
description).  In the normal case, only the latter scenario happens.
ext3 has a mode to flush all data before metadata gets committed.
That is its default mode, and it avoids this problem without having to
actually journal the data.

Yep.  ext3 behaves in the same way in its fastest "writeback" data
mode.

Indeed.

ext3 does exactly that.  It's necessary to keep things in sync if we
have blocks of data being deleted and reallocated as metadata, or
vice-versa.

If you are using full data journaling (ext3's "journal" data mode) or
the default "ordered" data mode, then no, you never see such
behaviour.
In the ordered mode, it achieves this precisely because it is keeping
a record of which blocks have been committed (or, more accurately,
which *deleted* blocks have had the delete committed).  If you do a
"cat > file", then before the new data is written, the file gets
truncated and all its old data blocks deleted.  ext3 will then refuse
to reuse those blocks until the delete has been committed, so if we
crash and end up rolling back the delete transaction, we'll never see
new data blocks in the old file.
Cheers,
 Stephen
