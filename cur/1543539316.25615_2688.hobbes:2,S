What would be the way to add a page of memory to the pool of RAM-pages
wherein programs can run?
What I want to do is; I have an PCI-card with on-board RAM. I want somehow
to tell the kernel that it can use that RAM as if it was any other RAM.
I'm not looking for elaborate code-fragments (altough they're welcome ;-]),
but pointers where to look would be nice.
Thanks in advance,
Folkert van Heusden.
p.s.: do a reply-to-all so that I receive your replies (if any); I'm not
(yet) on the kernel-mailinglist.
