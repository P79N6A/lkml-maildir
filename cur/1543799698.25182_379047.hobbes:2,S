Sorry, we should probably drop this one (and #2) again. The required 3rd 
patch was only recently added to Linus' tree and I didn't get a chance 
to send it to you.
I also have a report that even with the 3rd patch the problem is still 
there:

I'm now wondering if that is related to the option that Pavel just 
pointed out. I'll be sending that bug upstream once we have more details.
