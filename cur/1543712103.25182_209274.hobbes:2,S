That was probably me, actually.

Seems perfectly sane.
However, I've got a few pending patches that touch the same areas and
do some more critical cleanup that I've been sitting on since the
2.6.0 freeze. So perhaps I should start pushing those again and we can
queue this behind them. David, if you get a chance, grab the latest
copy of my linux-tiny tree from
 
http://www.selenic.com/tiny/2.6.5-rc2-tiny1-broken-out.tar.bz2
 
http://www.selenic.com/tiny/2.6.5-rc2-tiny1.patch.bz2
and see how I've tweaked the pool structure and the locking and how
your bits fit with it.

Can we avoid adding this ifdef in some fashion? What does the compiler
generate here when prefetch is a no-op? This seems to call for a
prefetch_range(start, len) function/macro in any case.
