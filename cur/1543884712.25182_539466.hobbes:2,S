I'm assuming that the FB is used. Neither of my two
computers can do VGA text mode. Even for computers
which can do VGA text mode, if you want large fonts
(either by number of characters or by character width)
you need to use FB. That's just a requirement; anything
else would be insane.

Reliably sending printk through a userspace console is not
even possible. (consider a panic, OOM, or runaway RT task)
