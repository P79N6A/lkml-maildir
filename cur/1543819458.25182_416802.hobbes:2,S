if it's slow redrawing, i'd blame the video driver or X, not KDE/Qt - tough 
you might want to try another style and windowdecoration. plastik is 
generally speaking quite fast, or try the 'light' style. Xorg xcomposite 
might help too, but i guess your video card won't like that :D
slow app startup will be better in Kubuntu Dapper+1, as they will finally 
incorporate the new fontconfig (*g* i hope so) and use GCC's C++ symbol 
invisibillity in KDE/Qt. those both can give speedups in the area of 10-20%, 
so that should be noticable. KDE 3.5.3 also will also have a few other 
patches to speed up the KDE startup process, so - faster login, too.
now with al this, its hard to imagine KDE 4 will again sport some 20/30% 
speedup due to reduced memory usage/binary size ;-)
