I did respond to that one, but perhaps some mail have been getting lost,
cause i cant find any more from you in my inbox.

I must admit i havent tested the very very latest, will do

Well, im not sure how good i would be at maintaining SD, my idea was
more or less just do the bare minimum to get the thing running on newer
kernels :)

Actually, now that you mention ogg123, i've had some bugs on CFS with
this, i thought it was an ogg123 bug, but now that i remember it its
only on CFS i have it.. when i run multiple ogg123 instances, suddenly
they will just stop playing and lock up. This happens when someone
writes alot fast to me on kopete, where i use ogg123 to play a bling
sound..
