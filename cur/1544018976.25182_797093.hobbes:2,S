Another iteration.  I didn't use a general finish_wait_exclusive() but
a version of this function that just returns whether we were woken
through the queue or not.  The result is stable due to the waitqueue
lock.  The callsites use it only if interrupted and the normal
finish_wait() otherwise.

With exclusive waiters, every process woken up through the wait queue
must ensure that the next waiter down the line is woken when it has
finished.
However, if the waiting processes sleep interruptibly, they might
abort waiting prematurely.  And if this in turn races with an ongoing
wake up, the woken up process might be the one currently aborting the
wait and the next real contender is never woken up, doomed to stay on
the queue forever.
This has been observed with __wait_on_bit_lock() used by
lock_page_killable().  If the contender was killed and woken up at the
same time, the next contender would never be woken up: the previous
lock holder would wake the interrupted contender and the interrupted
contender would never do unlock_page() -> __wake_up_bit() because it
never took the lock in the first place.
To fix this, it must be ensured that when the interrupted task tries
to remove itself from the waitqueue (finish_wait) it has to check for
whether it was woken up through the queue, and if so, wake up the next
contender.
Add finish_wait_woken() which does the same as finish_wait() but also
returns whether the wait descriptor was already removed from the
queue.  Serialized by the waitqueue spinlock, this is safe indicator
for whether we have to wake up the next contender or the previously
running task will do it.
Then use this function for __wait_event_interruptible_exclusive() and
__wait_on_bit_lock() to wake up the next contender if needed.
