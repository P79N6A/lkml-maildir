Hi Andre,
The motherboard has VIA-chipset.
What does this mean for me?
Will the APIC-problems be solved in the future or do I have to deside upon
running "noapic" semi-crippled or not run Ultra-DMA?

If this is a VIA SMP system there are APIC problems that you do not want
to even think about addressing.
MPS1.1 and passing "noapic" will fix most of there mess, but you have a
semi-crippled system, but it runs.
