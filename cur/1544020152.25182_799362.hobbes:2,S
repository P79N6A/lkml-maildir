As I said in the patch, I'm really ok with any naming. Adding another 
pre/suf-fix seemed to render names a little on the long side, hence the 
'k' choice.

Will try to see if I can come up with something, although is not really 
easy to simulate what can happen in a real life scenario.
What happens today is that if you're waiting for POLLOUT, say in a socket, 
a new incoming packet will trigger a wakeup, epoll has to check the 
ready-list, call f_op->poll, verify that the event doesn't match the 
interest, and go back to sleep. Same if it was waiting for POLLIN, and 
write-space was triggered.
