The ccw_device_id structure contains two more fields in addition to the
field that are set up in ccw_device_recog_done, namely match_flags and
driver_info. driver_info is set later in ccw_bus_match, so that is fine.
match_flags of the device is never used, only the match_flags of the
drivers version of the ccw_device_id is used. So the code is correct
even without the memset. But your point about the maintenance pitfall is
valid, we will add a memset after 2.6.18. I don't want to push yet
another patch.
