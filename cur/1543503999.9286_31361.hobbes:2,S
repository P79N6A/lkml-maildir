Not at all --- if you have two machines, each with an internal disk
being mirrored to the other, then you only need to mount the filesystem
on one of those machines at once for failover.  The negotiation of who
has that right is a separate issue, of course (the same host should also
be the owner of the software raid array, and we also need to manage
rebuild of the raidset when the other machine resurfaces).
