Indeed. The fact is, we do need a "testing ground" for some experimental
fixes to stuff that needs to be fixed, and that's one of the things the
-mm kernels used to do for 2.5.x.
Since everybody was pretty comfy with that setup, we'll just continue that 
way. By the time 2.7.x opens up, things should have calmed down, and 
commercial vendors have their support trees in shape etc, but for now the 
-mm tree is a testing ground, and I'll make -pre trees that should be 
fairly stable, and then we'll do the 2.6.1 etc "real releases" based off 
them.
