Subject: [PATCH] [Request for inclusion] Filesystem in Userspace
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew, Linus!
Please consider adding the FUSE filesystem to the mainline kernel.
FUSE exports the filesystem functionality to userspace.  The
communication interface is designed to be simple, efficient, secure
and able to support most of the usual filesystem semantics.
Reasons why I think inclusion is a good idea:
  - It is widely used.  There are many filesystems available which use
    FUSE, and there are probably even more in-house applications
  - It's been around for 3 years, it's very stable and both the kernel
    interface and the library API have matured
  - It's non-intrusive, the patch doesn't touch other parts of the
    kernel
Patches for 2.6.10-rc2 and 2.6.10-rc1-mm5 are available from:

Comments are welcome.
Thanks,
Miklos
