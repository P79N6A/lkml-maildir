Having all of the namespaces is certainly on my TODO list.
I'm not at all certain if there is a need for a kernel container
concept.

Currently redirecting a system call from the new host back to it's
original home is not something I had planned on.  Most of the reasons
I want to migrate relate to avoiding the hardware I am migrating from.
Either to reduce it's load or to leave before the hardware dies.
That said the idea of a user space monitor that can handle
the strange virtualization things that don't fit well into the
kernel is appealing.
Note all of the migration I am looking is not process migration but
container migration.  So I want a container per application.
