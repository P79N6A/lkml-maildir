Hi!
We are trying to track down ugly bug where machines fail to power down
/ power up at first occassion on 2.6.8.1 + acpi parts from 2.6.9-bk1.
Unfortunately all acpi changes in this area are merged into "BKrev:
412f21c8cj8TLCDiYwWr68kVXtdeXg" => it is not easy to find bug by
binary search. Is there easy way to get split-up patches?
Bjorn: You could probably download individual patches from bkbits.net
by hand and try to revert them one by one.
Others: Is there easier way than that?
Improvement request:
One big change looks like this on cvs log...
[PATCH] USB: USB PhidgetServo driver update
Once again a (small) patch for the phidgetservo driver.
Some servos have a very high maximum angle, set upper limit to the
maximum allowed by the hardware. Reported by Mario Scholz

....would it be possible to put some bkrev's or urls for the
individual changes? If I want to find patch corresponding to last
change on bkbits, ... I guess I can only grep for changelog comment.
