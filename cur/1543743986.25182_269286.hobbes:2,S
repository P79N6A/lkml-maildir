It also looks like we should have gotten an oops in do_wait() if this ever
happened with SLAB poisoning. Google doesn't seem to find any reports like
that.
Of course, the race to make this happen is likely extremely small indeed,
so the reason may just be that nobody ever triggers it in practice (and it
almost certainly requires that a threaded app waits for its children in
multiple threads, which is also fairly unusual - so this is likely a very
small race coupled with an access pattern that doesn't actually happen in
real life).
But maybe it's because I just missed some reason why this all is ok. I'd 
love to be wrong about it.
Anyway, if I'm right, the suggested fix would be something like this (this 
replaces the earlier patches, since it also makes the zero return case go 
away - we don't need to mark anything runnable, since we restart the whole 
loop).
NOTE! -EAGAIN should be safe, because the other routines involved can only
return -EFAULT as an error, so this is all unique to the "try again"  
case.
Ok, three patches for the same piece of code withing minutes. Please tell 
me this one is not also broken..
