All I said was "I can't upgrade the kernel". There's nothing stopping me 
patching it, as long as nothing happens to the Ethernet and ATM driver 
interface side of things - this is all protocol-layer stuff and should be well 
away from the EDI. I can't honestly see why/how fixing a bug in IPv6 would 
completely invalidate the way the Ethernet/ATM drivers interface with the kernel.
All I wanted to know is if if there WAS a known IPv6 routing issue in this 
kernel, and then fix the kernel I've got. That would leave me with a variant 
of the kernel in itself.
I'm not claiming to have found an Oops, nor am I providing an Oops log from a 
tainted kernel. All I'm trying to do is find out WHY this doesn't work, IF 
it's a known issue, and HOW to fix it myself.
Thanks.
