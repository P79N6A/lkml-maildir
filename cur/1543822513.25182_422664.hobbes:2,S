Per-cpu variables need to be accessed only with preemption
disabled.  And the preemption enable/disable operations
provide a compiler memory barrier.
#define preempt_disable() \
do { \
	inc_preempt_count(); \
	barrier(); \
} while (0)
 ...
#define preempt_enable() \
do { \
	preempt_enable_no_resched(); \
	barrier(); \
	preempt_check_resched(); \
} while (0)
The scheduler itself need to take care to not cause the situation
you mention either.
Therefore this is an issue we had already, not some new thing
introduced by using __thread for per-cpu variables.
