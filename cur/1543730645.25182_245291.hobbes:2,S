Subject: [patch 1/2] make page table index functions take void*
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Andi, since this is your code, I thought I'd send these to you to look over
first.  Do you have any good test cases for this code?  I don't think I have
any hardware that uses the NX bit.  
Instead of casting the void*'s into "unsigned long"s to pass into the pagetable
functions: p{gd,md,te}_index(), do a cast inside the macro.  All of the current
callers should be "unsigned long"s already, so this should have no other
effect than making it valid to pass a void* to those functions.
