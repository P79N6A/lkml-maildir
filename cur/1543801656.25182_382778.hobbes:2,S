Well, if I were going for _un_readability I'd have suggested:
        printk(space = !space ? "     " : "\n");

I think it's a psychological thing because it makes you spend as
much time parsing a single line as it would to parse a whole
if-then-else and it just feels wrong somehow.

For simple espressions I think it's about the same, but like you said
it's a personal thing.  A soon as you start nesting cases the 'if'
becomes much clearer.  (People who nest ternary expressions should
be taken out and shot.)
