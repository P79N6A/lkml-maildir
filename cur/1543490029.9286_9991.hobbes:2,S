Hi -
I'm new to this list, but I found an old bug that
caused me weeks of headache, and wanted to announce
it's existence so that someone else doesn't get
stuck in the same wicket that I did.
FIRST! Please don't flame me for reporting a 2.0.x
bug... I'm mailing the list to *REPORT* the bug (so
that others know about it), *NOT* to request a fix
for the bug:
===THE BUG REPORT===
For those of you using a 2.0.x kernel with egcs
(this probably includes everyone using Slackware
3.5 and 3.6) and has their BIOS assigning 2 or more
PCI cards to the same IRQ (which should, in theory,
work) you'll notice that the drivers for these cards
cannot be loaded in the kernel at the same time when
they are compiled as modules.
The Fix:
Upgrade to a 2.2.x kernel.  This problem is fixed
in 2.2.x...
Thanks for your time,
Loren
(P.S. I've got an item for the 2.2 wish-list, but
since it's not relevant to this post, I'll put in
a separate email.)
