Subject: [PATCH/RFC 0/2] simple SPI controller implementation on PXA2xx SSP port
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Following this will be two patches, releasing an initial "SPI controller" 
implementation running on David Brownell's "simple SPI framework" and a 
prototype "SPI protocol" driver for the Cirrus Logic CS8415A SPD/IF decoder 
chip.  The controller should run on any PXA2xx SSP port and has been tested on
the PXA255 NSSP port.  Complete board setup and description facilities per the
the SPI framework are supported.
Your comments and suggestions encouraged!  You can e-mail me directly if you
have any question regarding running SPI controller on your board.
Thank you David for helping me make this real!
