I use SAK from time to time when I have problems with hung processes.
Sometimes it is difficult to figure out what was being killed and why.
For example, Midnight Commander contains a bug: it holds fd#3 open to
the tty. It prevented me from daemonizing processes (like X) - they
died upon SAK. 
This little patch makes SAK tell whom and why it kills. Tested.
