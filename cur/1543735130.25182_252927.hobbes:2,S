Agreed.  Ok, should be easy to fix with the same scheme, except
that it has to use offset 0 instead of 1 for the !FP case.
I will cook up a patch.
BTW the SMP check is also wrong because preemptive kernels also
need this unwinding, although they should not spend too much
time in locking.

It's more than WCHAN, e.g. sysrq-t assumes it too.
