You're using a reserved field; how do you mean "compatible" in this
situation? Think of a filesystem with real files > 2TB. How will an
unpatched ext3fs driver handle those files? You'll only see the <2TB
content, right?
May an unpatched version under any circumstances clear the high-order
bits of the newly introduced 64bit integer, just because it doesn't know
to preserve this reserved field's value?

Being unfamiliar eith ext3's internals, are there other
reserved/free-for-future-use fields that don't clash with the HURD?
Are you proposing a patch like this for ext2, too?
