User should not know about low-level transport - 
it is like socket layer -  write only data and do not care about
how it will be delivered.

In the previous versions netlink group was assigned as incremented
counter, 
that was not convenient, but now we have 2-way ID, which is better
from users point of view - idx is supposed to be major id, val - 
some subsystem of that set.

Each connector message requires pair of u32 ids - idx and val.
Idx is generic system id [which is equal to the appropriate netlink
group
in current implementation], while val is id of some subsytem
inside idx.
Using only group without it's own connector's id will heavily
complex callback register/unregister notification [Jamal's suggested
feature]
for example.
