Sorry about that.

+ help
+ The "USB HID Mouse Interrupt Polling Interval" is the interval, at
+ which your USB HID mouse is to be polled at. The interval is
+ specified in miliseconds.
+
+ Decreasing the interval will, of course, give you a much more
+ precise mouse.
+
+ Generally speaking, a polling interval of 2 ms should be more than
+ enough for most people, and is great for gaming and other things
+ that require high precision.
+
+ An interval lower than the default is not guaranteed work on your
+ specific piece of hardware. If you want to play it safe, don't
+ change this value.
+
+ Now, if you indeed want to feel the joy of a precise mouse, the
+ following mice are known to work without problems, when the interval
+ is set to at least 2 ms:
+
+ * Logitech's MX-family
+ * Logitech Mouse Man Dual Optical
+ * Logitech iFeel
+ * Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer
+ * Microsoft Intellimouse Optical 1.1
+
+ If unsure, keep it at 10 ms.
