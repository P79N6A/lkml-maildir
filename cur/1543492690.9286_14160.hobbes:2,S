Dear friends,
I have downloaded the 2.2.3 kernel from sunsite and tried to compile.
I have a Realtek 8139 NIC card.  When I browse the Driver files in 
drivers/net directory, I found that the code for the above card is
available (rtl8139.c) but there is no menu item in both config and
menuconfig for kernel configuration hence I am not able to select the
file.  Kindly help me in this regard.
TIA
