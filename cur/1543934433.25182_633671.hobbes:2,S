Subject: [PATCH] fix the sysfs_add_file_to_group interfaces
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I can't see a reason why these shouldn't work on every group.  However,
they only seem to work on named groups.  This patch allows the group
functions to work on anonymous groups (those with NULL names).

Again, this is something that's needed by the code to convert the SCSI
transport classes to groups (because we currently have the attributes
set up as anonymous groups on class devices).  So, taking this via the
SCSI tree would be appreciated.
Thanks,
James
