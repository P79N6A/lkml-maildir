To be fair, the _problem_ wasn't solved in under 4 hours.  He was given an
answer to a known problem in less than 4 hours.
However, you are correct in implying linux support is, in many respects,
far better than that of any commercial OS.  Anyone tried explaining to
Microsoft or Sun that something is broken?  They both immidiately assume
you are an idiot (I;m sure that's true more offen than not) and proceed
with an attitude of "how dare you suggest our OS is broken."
