You can tell a subsystem from a module quite reliably because it has a 
subtree of dependant questions. Now you might get it wrong, but its still
correct to prompt for the subtree of questions again since if you've just
forced on eepro100 for example, you do want to be asked mmio/pio and the
like

The graph tells you that. The only interesting case I could find is the
negation one - some rules are  A conflicts with B which makes the UI side
much more fun
