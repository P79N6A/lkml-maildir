The code I guess needs to spot that there isnt an APIC. The test proposed is
very wrong though. A CPU can have a local apic on a SMP board with no APIC
or IO-APIC set up (eg on daughtercard stuff)
There is only one sane test I can see. Figure if the CPU can have an APIC and
test it. If it cant have an APIC run a 489 test if there is an MP table
and actually poke the bits and see if its there
