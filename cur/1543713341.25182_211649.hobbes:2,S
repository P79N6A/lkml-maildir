That change was made for scheduling latency reasons, mainly due to huge
pagetable walks in zap_page_range():
    i_shared_lock is held for a very long time during vmtruncate() and
    causes high scheduling latencies when truncating a file which is
    mmapped.  I've seen 100 milliseconds.
    So turn it into a semaphore.  It nests inside mmap_sem.  This
    change is also needed by the shared pagetable patch, which needs to
    unshare pte's on the vmtruncate path - lots of pagetable pages need to
    be allocated and they are using __GFP_WAIT.
If we no longer hold that lock during pte takedown then sure, it would
be better if we had a spinlock in there.
