Yup, I missed that.   Thanks for pointing it out.

I expect this will be a write_lock_irq() since zap_other_threads will be
doing a bit more than just reading the task info.
This will be down in a do-page-fault failure path (see
arch/*/mm/fault.c).  I wonder if calling write_lock is going to be safe,
or if its possible to get into a deadlock?  i.e. should I branch back up
to the survive: label if I can't take the lock?  Would that even be
sufficient? or is it not an issue here?

Yup, next spin I'll add more to the changelog.
