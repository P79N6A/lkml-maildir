Subject: 2.2.x hang on boot, no Magic SysReq key either.

I've got an HP Vectra VL series 3 underclocked (yes, under) to 90Mhz (from
100) that freezes solid on any 2.2.x kernel I've tried (2.2.0, 2.2.2,
2.2.2ac5) seemingly right after starting the network scripts. This also
happened with 2.1.Xpre7 (I forget what X was prior to 2.2), but I couldn't
spend any time debugging it.
The NIC is an HPj3171a (aka, an Intel EEPro 100). The system is a P90,
24MB EDO RAM which compiles kernels without sig11-ing (several kernels
since I've tried various attempts to get it to work). An AHA2940 SCSI
board with a 4.2GB Connor drive attached. A "buggy" CMD640 (workaround
enabled) with a 420MB boot drive is also present. I don't know what the MB
is.
Like stated in the title, SysReq does nothing to remedy the break, and
2.0.36 works perfectly fine, so fine that it had an uptime of around 2
months before I tried upgrading.
On a side note, here's how to scare the daylights out of yourself: reboot
RH5.2 after having NIS working but not having tested a reboot. RH decided
to run ypbind and yppasswdd before starting ypserv. Hrm, that works *REAL*
nicely for the NIS server. Right. Yeah.
If you need to contact me, please CC me <bkosse@iname.com> privatly since
I don't actively subscribe to the list (my dial-up link would just die). I
will also check the archives.
Thanks for the help.
