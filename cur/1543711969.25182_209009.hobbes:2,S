No, mprotect() on the entire stack will mark the vm_area with the
desired protection and VM_GROWSDOWN/VM_GROWSUP will expand
automatically with the new protection.  And if you want to expand the
stack in user-level, e.g., by intercepting SIGSEGV, you'll either do
an mmap() or mprotect() at any rate so there is zero extra cost there.
