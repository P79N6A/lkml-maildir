yeah. AFAIK most other mainstream OSs also still often use similarly 
'arcane' concepts (i'm here ignoring literature, you can find everything 
and its opposite suggested in literature) so i felt the need to point 
out the difference ;) After all Linux is about doing a better mainstream 
OS, it is not about beating the OS literature at lunacy ;-)
The precise statement would be: "there's no concept of giving out a 
time-slice to a task and sticking to it unless a higher-prio task comes 
along, nor is there a concept of having a low-res granularity 
->time_slice thing. There is accurate accounting of how much CPU time a 
task used up, and there is a granularity setting that together gives the 
current task a fairness advantage of a given amount of nanoseconds - 
which has similar [but not equivalent] effects to traditional timeslices 
that most mainstream OSs use".

note that you can set it to 0 and the box still functions - so 
sched_granularity_ns, while useful for performance/bandwidth workloads, 
isnt truly inherent to the design.
So in the announcement i just opted for a short sentence: "there's no 
concept of timeslices", albeit like most short stentences it's not a 
technically 100% accurate statement - but still it conveyed the intended 
information more effectively to the interested lkml reader than the 
longer version could ever have =B-)
