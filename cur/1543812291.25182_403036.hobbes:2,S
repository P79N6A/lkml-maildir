atomic_read is special since it's not actually an atomic operation ;)
but.. think about it: you do 2 atomic reads, however there is ZERO
guarantee that the reads are atomic with respect to eachother; eg your
head and tail are not an atomic "snapshot" of these 2 variables!

you can also use WARN_ON() and BUG_ON() for that, you then get a more
readable oops message (with filename and line information)

msg should have the __user atribute here since it can be in userspace...
sometimes. It is the "sometimes" that is the bad idea!

well that's the other extreme. But if it's going to be a major source of
memory allocations, yes. If it's only sometimes, or "a few", then no.
For example if your tasklet function allocates one, and then frees it
before being done, I don't see a problem. It becomes a problem when
there will be many of these, and when they have longer lifetimes,
because then the vm can become starved of memory before it has a chance
to do correct the memory imbalance.
(GFP_ATOMIC is like borrowing from the VM, the VM will be in slight
imbalance afterwards. With GFP_KERNEL you allow the kernel to fix this
imbalance. A slight imbalance is fine and not a problem. Especially if
you give it the memory back soon. But if the imbalance can accumulate,
for example because you keep allocating and free the memory much later,
it can become a problem)
