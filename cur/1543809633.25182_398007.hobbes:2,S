Hello,
I am writing to you to request your help in a very disturbing case of an 11 year old girl who is fighting for her life.
Four years ago, Lavinia Velman was returning home from the kindergarten when she was hit by a car.
The recovery was hard and at one time her life depended on a breathing machine in a hospital.
On 24th of December 2003, Lavinia received as donation a semi-portable breathing machine she could use at home.
Lavinia's life had begun to return to normal. She could move her hands and could stay without the breathing machine for up to 10 hours.
A new tragedy struck in October last year when an electricity black out caused Lavinia's breathing machine to stop.
The black out lasted for a few hours, so long that even the breathing machine's batteries ran out.
The child panicked and went into cardiac arrest. The medics were very skeptical regarding her chances of survival.
Now the only solution is an operation in a hospital in the UK (Cromwell Hospital, London).
The costs for the transport and operation are around £30,000.
Lavinia's family lives in Sofia, Bulgaria. They are quite poor and have been able to gather only a small part of that amount.
Please make a donation to support Lavinia and her grief torn family. Please help her in her fight to survive.
Your donation, whatever the amount, is greatly appreciated and can make a difference.
Donations can be made via check or money order to: 
Victor Velman
32 Bangor Street, Port Dinorwic, Gwynedd, LL56 4JD
United Kingdom
Please make checks payable to: VICTOR VELMAN .
Thank you very much in advance!
Silvia and Bill Durham, trying to support a worthy cause
