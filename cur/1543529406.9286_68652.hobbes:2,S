I tried to activate it on a 2.2.x kernel. In fact, there's even a bit
of scaffolding left in the source from a previous attempt (by Alan I
guess). All you get are time outs on the dma channel. A lot of people
have tried and this seems to be the general result.
Feel free to try though. If you get it to work, I'd be very
interested.
