  Hi, all. Version 211 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
Patch directly available from:
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rgooch/v2.5/devfs-patch-current.gz
AND:
ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/linux/kernel-patches/v2.5/devfs-patch-current.gz
NOTE: kernel 2.5.1 and later require devfsd-v1.3.19 or later.
This is against 2.5.10. Highlights of this release:
- Do not put miscellaneous character devices in /dev/misc if they
  specify their own directory (i.e. contain a '/' character)
- Copied macro for error messages from fs/devfs/base.c to
  fs/devfs/util.c and made use of this macro
- Removed 2.4.x compatibility code from fs/devfs/base.c
				Regards,
					Richard....
