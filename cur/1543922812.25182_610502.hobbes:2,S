Michael Kerrisk, whom I've copied, does.  I recently sent in an update
to all of the mempolicy man pages that describe the behavior as it
currently exists.  [I need to send in an update for
MPOL_F_MEMS_ALLOWED].
One of the things that has bothered me is that there are no cpuset man
pages to reference from the mempolicy man pages.  [I know, we can and do
refer to the kernel source Documentation, but that might not be
available to everyone w/o some digging.  "See Also" refs typically point
at other man pages...].  To get around this, I had to talk about "nodes
allowed in the current context" or some such weasel-wording in my
updates.
Paul:  what do you think about subsetting the cpuset.txt into a man page
or 2 that can be referenced by other man pages' See Also sections?
