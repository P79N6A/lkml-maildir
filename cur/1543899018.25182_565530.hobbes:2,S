The patches have some trivial-but-common coding-style bloopers which
scripts/checkpatch.pl will detect.  Please check it out.
Please send a patch which documents mfgpt_irq in
Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt, thanks.
Andy, the miss rate on documentation for new __setup() handlers is about
75%.  Might be worth adding to checkpatch.pl.
