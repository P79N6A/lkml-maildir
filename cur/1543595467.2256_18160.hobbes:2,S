Subject: [PATCH] CREDITS update
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

My association with VA Linux Systems (and Precision Insight before that)
ended last month.  At this stage, it is unclear whether I will continue
working on the various open source 3D graphics projects (DRI, Mesa etc)
or not.  My work is being transitioned to the remaining members of the
PI group or, unfortunately, abandoned for the time being.
I hope to be able to continue working on the kernel, perhaps in slightly
different areas though :-)
