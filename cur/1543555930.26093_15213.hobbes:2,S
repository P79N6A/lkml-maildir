Me too. (:  Keith posed two objections:
1. The >] could get word-wrapped so that it doesn't appear on the same
   line as the [<.  I *do not* see what makes this hard to parse
   reliably.
2. Someone (i.e. kernel debugger) could insert extra text.  Well, same
   culprits can mangle oopsen already -- see klogd.  These evil tools,
   whichever ones they may be, should learn to use /* */ or something.
   That way it is relatively easy to ignore their output.

PS. Should we be using KERN_* here?
