Just a note (which Al probably considered too obvious to point out), but
MAX_NESTED_LINKS isn't the maximum number of followed symlinks.  It's
the number of recursions we're limited to.  The maximum number of
symlinks followed is 40 (see fs/namei.c:do_follow_link).
Al, would it be worth making 40 an enumerated constant in the same
enumeration as MAX_NESTED_LINKS?  Something like this:
