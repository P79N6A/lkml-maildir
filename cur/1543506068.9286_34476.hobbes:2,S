Do you mean that you inspected the whole 2419 lines of code that refers to 
jiffies and investigated the corresponding source files ? ;-)
I would be impressed if I really beleived so. :)
All this mess-up for, in fact, a simple problem. But as we know, dealing 
with date and time hasn't been a great success in I.T. The Y2K problem 
will be our punishment.
In most cases where you need to deal with timeout, you just have to:
1) Calculate a deadline by adding some positive delta to the current
   time.
2) Test for the expiration of this deadline.
You can cover this need by 2 simple abstractions in Linux:
1) Calculate the kernel time of the deadline:
   #define ktime_get(delta)  (jiffies + (u_long)(delta))
2) Check against the expiration:
   #define ktime_exp(tlimit) ((long)jiffies - (long)(limit)) >= 0)
   (assuming that tlimit has been obtained using ktime_get())
I bet everybody that the above trivial stuff covers more than 80% of 
the needs regarding timeout issues.
For more complex stuff or guys, we can add some other stuff and advise
users to use it only when it is really needed, for example:
3) Add a delta to a kernel time value:
   #define ktime_add(a, d) ((a) + (u_long)(d))
4) Substract a delta from a kernel time value:
   #define ktime_sub(a, d) ((a) - (u_long)(d))
5) Compare or diff 2 kernel time values:
   #define ktime_dif(a, b) ((long)(a) - (long)(b))
It seems that time issue is too complex for the average human. Einstein
have had to suffer of that in some early time and we all will suffer of
the Y2K catastroph due to this human abstraction limitation. ;-)
