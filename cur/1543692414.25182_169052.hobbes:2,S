I (along with quite a few others I suspect) read linux-kernel for 
(amongst other things) interesting things about linux.
Announcements of ports to new machines seem to be entirely on-topic,
even if it's by a third party that found linux in their toaster.
I don't see a functional difference between "I intend to port linux to my
toaster, can people help", and "I want to get source for the linux running
on my toaster, can people help".
I have purchased a WRT54G on the basis that it (through the efforts of
the seattlewireless group and many others) contains a running linux 
enviroment that can be customised to an extent that lets me do lots of
things that would otherwise be impossible without a much more expensive
device.
I intend to write to linksys and inform them of this, along with the 
saying that I'll buy more if I can get full enough source to compile
kernels and make firmware.
