Hi,
what is the status of fs-cache? 
I'm asking, because the PS3 gained access to the video memory as a block 
device recently. I'm using it as a swap device and set swappiness to 100. 
Since the PS3 has only little (main)-memory (< 256MB), it would be more 
effective to use the video memory (~180MB) primary as the file system cache 
and all the main-memory as page cache (swappiness = 0?).
I know that fs-cache is for network-fs caching, but could it be used to cache 
ext3/4 filesystem?
Greetings
Marvin
