It is obscure.  Someone may have a case that makes it easy to
reproduce but it won't happen frequently.
So we should have enough time to review and fix this carefully,
instead of needing to rush a fix out.

Huh?  The irq lock is sufficient for this.
This is not a code software problem, this is a software hardware
interaction problem.  This is a problem in that there is no way to
guarantee that ioapics see a series of manipulations in the same
order that the cpu issues those manipulations.
In particular the ioapic is seeing the ack after we reprogram
the ioapic, which causes the ioapic to not accept the ack (because
it's vector number changed) and then the ioapic waits forever
for an ack that isn't coming.
The other half of the problem is pending_eoi() is testing a bit in the
hardware that in my experience is not sufficient to guarantee that
the hardware is in a state where action may be taken.
This is a very delicate problem because there is little if any guaranteed
ordering between cpu operations and ioapic operations, especially because
there are two channels of communication the ``apic bus'' and the memory
mapped ioapic registers.  So what happens on one channel has no ordering
requirements of any kind with what happens on the other channel.
