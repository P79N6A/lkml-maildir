Yes Adrian, it should be 2.15 instead. My mistake.
Hopefully this patch should solve steve's issue too.
Reattaching the patch with corrected changelog.
Thanks
Vivek
o i386 kernel reboots instantly if compiled with binutils older than
  2.15.
o Older binutils required explicit flags to mark a section allocatable
  and executable(AX). Newer binutils automatically mark a section AX if
  the name starts with .text.
o While defining a new section using assembler "section" directive,
  explicitly mention section flags.
