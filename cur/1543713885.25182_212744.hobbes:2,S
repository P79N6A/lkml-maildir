I might have the same problem.  I switched from 2.6.5-rc1 (I think) to 2.6.5 and 
lost my console.  Unfortunately I don't have the old config handy, but I'm 
pretty sure I had the framebuffer console off.  The only was I got my console 
back was to enable fbcon.  This is on x86_64 with a generic 32MB SiS card.
Any useful information I could send?
