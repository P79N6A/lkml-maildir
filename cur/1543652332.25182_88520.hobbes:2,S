going in function of time is even better of course, but just assuming
bytes to be a linear function of time would be a good start, it depends
if you want to backport the deadline I/O scheduler to 2.4 or not. I
think going in terms of bytes would be simpler for 2.4. We're going to
use 2.4 for at least one more year in some production environment, so I
think it could make sense to address this, at least to be a function of
bytes if not of time.
