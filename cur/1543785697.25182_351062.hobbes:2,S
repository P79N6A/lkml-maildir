Yep, 4294667.296 = 2^32/1000-300 is exactly the value jiffies gets
initialized to on i386. Supposedly subtraction of INITIAL_JIFFIES is
missing here.

Yes, this seems to be different, possibly unrelated problem.
It's interesting that the value jumps _exactly_to_zero_, though.
Will need to dig into the code...
