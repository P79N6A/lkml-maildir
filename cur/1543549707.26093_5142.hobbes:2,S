Well, if this isn't worth doing right... Patch size is just something
you have to deal with. Hopefully you can get an early-2.5.x merge.

Why limit it? If the existing poll method needs extension, do it.

That may be, but we deal with it all the time. The VFS code has to
be well-optimized and SMP-safe. Besides, many of these Win32 handles
will refer to files anyway, won't they?
>   * The dentry filename support does not handle anonymous files.
Sure it does. What do you want, pre-deleted files or filesystems
that do not appear anywhere? You can have a filesystem floating
around in free space, sort of half-way mounted (no mount point),
and filled with deleted files with random hex names.
>   * The dentry filename support does not handle separate namespaces.
By this you mean...? Can you not just apply a prefix?
Perhaps you could use the half-way mounted filesystems,
with some way to specify the desired filesystem root.

Well, that would be generally useful for Linux software.
Also useful: an open-read-close operation that doesn't muck around
with fd allocation. Maybe hang the data off of a struct stat, so that
callers can atomicly get everything.

OK. Problem?
The list would be NULL most of the time. If Linux apps start
using this feature a lot, then it can be optimized.

Excuse me? Does Win32 not allow rename of open files?
Assuming that is the problem, you have a few options I think.
You could let handles block rename, except that you might let
root override restrictions caused by non-root users. You could
just ignore this problem and see what, if anything, breaks.
You could lie I suppose, supplying old names as needed.

Yeah, that is a problem. Ignore it, so it might go away. :-)
Mere ASCII case is no problem, and wide characters can always
be translated to UTF-8 to keep the VFS happy. Maybe you can add
an alternate matching function for Win32 and MacOS API support.

Doesn't that strike you as being a hack that will cause you
to need _more_ code in the end? You'll end up writing a second
VFS layer if I'm not mistaken.
