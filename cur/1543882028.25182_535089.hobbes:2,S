Adrian,
I understand your concerns, it's more and more common to see developers
considering their work is worthless. But it's not. You should see the
current development model as a pipeline. What you feed at the input can
take some time to reach the output, and if we wait for the whole pipeline
to flush, more crap gets released.
What is needed is a higher priority on fixes for known regressions. I
find your summary above more readable than the large lists of regressions.
I think that you should reply to Linus' announces with something that
short, starting from the known-with-patch, known-for-more-than-1-month,
and all-known-regressions. It may help Linus focus even more on those.
Also, while it will not prevent any release with regressions, at least
it will prevent such a stupid case of known regressions with patch
available.
Also, check how many regressions you have reported and which have been
fixed during the -rc stage. You'll see your work really was useful.
Maybe Linus should accept to dedicate -final to known regressions only,
to force a check in this area ? Whether or not all of them get fixed is
not the real problem, but at least we will not have any regressions with
pending patch unapplied !
Please do continue that task if you have the time to do so !
Thanks,
Willy
