Can't comment. Another post states that they are using a 400W with problems.

Are you mixing connector types, ie gold/silver (I can't remember what they 
are made of )? This _will_ give you problems, among which including 
stability. You should _always_ match connectors with the mainboard. I 
apologize if you already know this.

See above, I'm just throwing out a potential solution.
