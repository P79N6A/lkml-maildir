Fixed endian isn't necessarily a requirement.  Detectable endian is.  As 
long as (a) the filesystem mkfs notes the endian-ness and (b) the kernel 
filesystem code properly handles both types of endian, life is fine.
For SquashFS, though, I would think that fixed endian would be easy. 
Since it is byte-packed, just handle endian as you unpack.
