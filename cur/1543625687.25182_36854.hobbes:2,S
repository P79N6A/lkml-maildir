Nope, look at the code and comments around "isa_dev"   :)
isa_dev is the PCI device structure for the ALi ISA bridge... very 
definitely a PCI device.
some background:
It is normal in some situations that you need to examine or set PCI 
config registers for the ISA bridge, when dealing with some IDE 
motherboards.  The southbridge is typically the chip that actually 
implements IDE on your motherboard.  Even though IDE is normally 
exported as a separate PCI device, you still have to deal with the ATA 
register blocks at hardcoded legacy ISA addresses 0x1f0 and 0x170.  So, 
when you write the ATA registers for channel 0 or channel 1, you are 
writing to 0x1f? or 0x17?, the ISA bridge is most likely the portion of 
the southbridge chip actually decoding those addresses for you.
