Hi,
  I maybe going mad (or it may be too late) - but I've been starting X,
quitting and restarting - and there are a couple of times over the last
day where I could have sworn that I pressed return on the startx and had
to hit return again.
This is 2.4.1-ac2 with XFree 4.0.2 on Alpha.
OK - it might be just going mad; but I'm fairly sure its loosing a key
there.....
Dave
