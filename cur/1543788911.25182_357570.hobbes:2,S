Hm, I think that this is even merged already, at least the exact same one liner
I sent is in Linus' git (see commit id dd0fc66fb33cd610bc1a5db8a5e232d34879b4d7). By the way, how
can you see the patch's source by using the commit id? 
git-cat-file "blob" dd0fc66fb33cd610bc1a5db8a5e232d34879b4d7
says "bad file."

		Boris.
