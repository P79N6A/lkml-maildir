Don't fear, go ahead, 2.6 should work fine without an i8042.

The default keymap. Patch was already created by somebody, I'll
include it soon.

This one should probably be Intl1 and not F14. Scancode collission
between japanese keyboards and some old keyboard.
We will never be able to create a scancode->keycode table that matches
all existing keyboards. This is why these tables can be changed from
userspace via ioctls.
