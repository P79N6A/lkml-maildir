Ah, this is for fixing the bug by this order of calls.

Ah, sorry. commit_charge_swapin() should chekc the page is still
SwapCache. Sorry. I'll update this in Monday.

yes. I'm wrong at that point.
I'll add PageSwapCache check to "commit" ops.

Hmm, doesn't that change will add new unnecessary complex ?

I'll revisit this Monday and think of swp_entry==0 problem.
Thank you for pointing out.
