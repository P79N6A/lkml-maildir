If you really believe that it is good practice to implement DMA in
a way so it works at some places as expected but on others not....
... then you like the Linux kernel be a junk yard :-(
Good practice is to fix _all_ related code in a project in case a bug
is identified and fixed at some place. Unfortunately this is not true
for Linux and for this reason, Linux cannot yet be called mature.
