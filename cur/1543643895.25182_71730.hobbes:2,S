In that case, I also suggest manual optimization for "convenient"
values of HZ, because from what I've seen, GCC can't figure this
out on its own:
#if 1000 % HZ == 0
#define MSEC(x) ((x) * (1000 / HZ))
#elif HZ % 1000 == 0
#define MSEC(x) ((x) / (HZ / 1000))
#else
#define MSEC(x) (((x) / HZ) * 1000 + ((x) % HZ) * 1000 / HZ)
#endif
