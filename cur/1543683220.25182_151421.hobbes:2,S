hi,
this is a bug report?!
with the linux kernel 2.4.22-pre8 from bk as of this day I get short stalls
about 5 to 8 seconds resulting in nothing happening with my machine at all.
(right now it happenend, but I can still type this)
the kernel reports the following two messages:
hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x64
hda: DMA interrupt recovery
hda: lost interrupt
...
hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x64
hda: DMA interrupt recovery
hda: lost interrupt
hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x64
hda: DMA interrupt recovery
hda: lost interrupt
hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x64
hda: DMA interrupt recovery
hda: lost interrupt
and so on.
so maybe this helps you find an error in the kernel.
best wishes,
axel siebenwirth
P.S. I attached gzipped dmesg and .config
