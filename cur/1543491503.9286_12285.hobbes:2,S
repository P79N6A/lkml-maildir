Hi all,
	I'm trying to install RH onto a HP omnibook I have lying around the house
and have come across a question I can not seem to find the answer for.
Hopefully you can shed some light..
	On my Desktop box Fstab lists my /usr partition as /dev/hda3 (I thnk it's
3 it could be 5, but you get the idea) and /home is /dev/hda5 and swap is
/dev/hda7.  This is ok as this system works fine.
	The Omnibook is a different matter however.  I was having problems getting
RH to install (at the Disk druid / fdisk stage) so I manually used fdisk
and set up four partitions.  hda1 -> hda4.  I then editied fstab to reflect
the 'new' partitions and their path.
	When I rebooted I get the message that the /usr, /home, and swap partions
can't be found.
	Does Linux _have_ to have certain /{paths} located on certain devices ?
(like on the working box) in which case how can I use fdisk to create a
/dev/hda7 partition for the swap or is something 'else' giving me grief and
this is just a red herring ?.
	Thanks in advance.
