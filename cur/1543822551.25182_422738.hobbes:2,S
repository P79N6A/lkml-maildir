AFAIK, many of these things are waited for uninterruptibly, and uninterruptible
tasks cannot be frozen.  Theoretically we may have a problem if there's an
interruptible task that waits for the completion of an operation that gets
finished after snapshotting the system.  However that would have to survive the
syncing of filesystems, freezing of kernel threads, freeing of memory as well
as suspending and resuming all devices.  [In which case it would be starving
to death. :-)]
