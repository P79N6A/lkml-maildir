Too bad that you cannot make them publish their infos.

Interesting, this was where I posted, as well...

And I won't, as I reverted to my stable kernel again and thus patching it 
again (yes it was 2.6.24 with early-quirks.c from git and your patch on top) 
doesn't give more info then I already provided. Furthermore I also told you 
that because of missing nforce2 ID the practical test wasn't really 
necessary.
Just add this line to your patch:
+       QBRIDGE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_NVIDIA, PCI_DEVICE_ID_NVIDIA_NFORCE2, 
nvidia_timer),
So that the quirk gets applied for nForce2, then your patch is - while still 
wrong in my eyes - not a regression anymore (for me) and thus I would take 
back my NAK(, but still not ACK it).
bye,
