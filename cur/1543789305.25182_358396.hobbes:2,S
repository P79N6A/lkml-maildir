Thanks a ton for figuring this out!

Overall the quirk is a hack until ATAPI is supported -- but even after 
ATAPI is supported, we need to figure out some way to keep IDE driver 
from stealing the legacy IDE ports before libata can touch them :(
However, when ATAPI is supported, that at least means that both PATA and 
SATA can run at full speed.
Your patch is correct, and should go into 2.6.14-rc post-haste.
I continue to grumble at the Kconfig annoyance:  CONFIG_SCSI_SATA is 
fundamentally a yes/no question.  CONFIG_SCSI_SATA=m makes no sense at 
all -- and causes problems, as we see -- but is required in order to do 
Kconfig dependencies correctly AFAIK.
Maybe 'if SCSI_SATA' is needed instead?  A lame way to implement 
dependencies, but if there is no other way...
