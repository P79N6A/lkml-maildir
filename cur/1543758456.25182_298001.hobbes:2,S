I have read through Matt Tolentino's version at least and this version of
the placement policy should be an easier merge for hotplug. Particularly,
stuff from his patch like the removal of magic numbers (which I should
have done anyway) are present in this version of the placement policy
patch. I will also move how a MAX_ORDER-1 block of pages is removed from
the global list and put it in it's own inline function.

If there are any other changes that might make hotplug's life easier, I'm
sure someone will shout :)
