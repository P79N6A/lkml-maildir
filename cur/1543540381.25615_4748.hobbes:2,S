Some options:
1.  MySQL database, create table TYPE=RAID
        (don't go creating bix indexes, because while the data file is
        split the index files are not)
2.  Alpha CPU
        (hooray for 64 bits!  gosh where did my budget go?)
3.  2.4 kernel
        (have we broken MS's vaporware record yet?)
4.  ReiserFS
        (but then we're all test-pilots of a sense)
5.  2.2.x kernel with the LFS patch
        (probably your easiest and safest option)
