Sure, that's the only way we do it (CRIS has typically too low performance
and memory to compile anything although it has been shown that it is
possible)
You can find the compiler at
http://www.axis.com/reg/login.php?oldurl=/products/dev_sdk/download_compiler
.php.
Unfortunately you have to register. 
The GCC CRIS maintainer is also very active in the GCC comunity.

Great - thanks!
Are there access to a cross-compile chain for i386 
somewhere?
