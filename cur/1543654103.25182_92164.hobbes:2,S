no of course, but something seems to be buggy...
..  nothing changed ;((
I have patched last 2.4.20-rc3 with Ingo patch (irqsharing.patch) or/and 
apic_route-2.4.18.patch ... patch applies with no problems but no change...
I have downloaded the prepatched kernel from www.aslab.com (linux-2.4.19-1)
(they affirm their servers use 7500) and even in this case no change 
appened...
I have HT enabled in the BIOS; SMP and IO-APIC are compiled in the kernel...
but I still receive some buggy messages in dmesg (see attachement), btw my 
full custom device has IRQ routed to 0 (see my lspci)
If anybody as some IDEA ... I will happy ;P
