Hi, I've got the following problem when I make modules with the 2.6.0-test3 version
CC [M]  drivers/char/riscom8.o
In file included from drivers/char/riscom8.c:51:
drivers/char/riscom8.h:88: field `tqueue' has incomplete type
drivers/char/riscom8.h:89: field `tqueue_hangup' has incomplete type
drivers/char/riscom8.c:84: warning: type defaults to `int' in
declaration of `DECLARE_TASK_QUEUE'
drivers/char/riscom8.c:84: warning: parameter names (without types) in
function
declaration
drivers/char/riscom8.c: In function `rc_paranoia_check':
drivers/char/riscom8.c:143: warning: implicit declaration of function
`kdevname'drivers/char/riscom8.c:143: warning: format argument is not a
pointer (arg 2)
drivers/char/riscom8.c:147: warning: format argument is not a pointer
(arg 2)
drivers/char/riscom8.c:142: confused by earlier errors, bailing out
make[2]: *** [drivers/char/riscom8.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [drivers/char] Error 2
make: *** [drivers] Error 2
I know maybe I have to disable the module, but I don't know which module should I disable. Thanks very much
