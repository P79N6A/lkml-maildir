yeah. What comes up periodically in GPLv3 discussions as 'proof' of what 
the GPL means are totally detached statements of the FSF and of RMS, 
often written a decade _after_ the GPL has been chosen for a license of 
the Linux kernel. (the whole anti-Tivo line was invented well after the 
fact.) And those statements have little bearing on the interpretation of 
the license of GPL-ed works. (unless, of course, the author of a GPL-ed 
work agrees with those statements and intends them to be his 
interpretation of the license.)
