MIPS drivers (and this one is specific to a particular MIPS SOC) are
generally a bit sloopy about checking of return values of ioremap because
ioremap is only doing some address arithmetic but no allocations that
actually could fail.  So for 64-bit kernels or addresses below 0x20000000
on a 32-bit system ioremap cannot fail.  In the same cases ioremap happens
to be a no-op because where nothing was allocated nothing needs to be
freed.

Note to self, __copy_from_user and gang are generally assume to not
return an error so it might be a good idea to move that unlikely() into
the macro definitions.
