There's unsolvable design issues in the way devfsd communication works
(with the last two patches the holes are closed as much as possible)
and it's fundamentally flawed by putting device name policy into
the kernel.   And then there's of course certain implementation quality
issues...
We have udev now which solves what devfs tried to solve without that
issues so people should switch to that ASAP.  That doesn't mean we
can simply rip it out because people started to rely on the non-standard
device names, but it's use is pretty much discouraged in 2.6.
