Hi,
  I have some old 486, on which i had installed Red
Hat linux 6.0 I have compiled the kernel several times
in DEC 99. It all worked fine. But Now in Jan when i
compile it with addition of few printk statements in
the net directory, i am getting a warning
WHEN I TYPE : make net
I get this warning
RULES.MAKE MODIFICATION TIME IS IN FUTURE (8817374 >
6729645)
Any clue. Also at the end of compilation it says 
CLOCK SKEW DETECTED YOUR BUILD MAY BE INCOMPLETE
Is it due to the year change over. And how can it be
corrected.
THANKS
SUJIT VAIDYA
