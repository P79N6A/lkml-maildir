My bet is on harddisk firmware acting weird.  You can prove this by
reconnecting the disk to known working port without cutting power.  Or,
you can prove that the original port works by removing the harddisk and
putting a different one.  You'll need to issue manual scan using SCSI
sysfs node.  It's very rare but some drives do choke like that.
