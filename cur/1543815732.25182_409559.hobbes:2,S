For any SCSI command including MODE_SENSE, 'bufflen'in scsi_cmnd structure holds actual data buffer size in bytes if 'use_sg' flage is NOT set.
The question is that "value of bufflen is 4 for the sd_read_cache_type operation and that is NOT sufficient to return header and page data by driver".
If there is something that I misunderstood with the operation, please guide.
