So why can't lib/string.c explicitly say __builtin_foo() instead of  
foo() where we mean the former?  Here's a brief summary:
With -ffreestanding:
   __builtin_foo():  Use the GCC built-in if possible, otherwise out- 
of-line
   foo():            Always use the out-of-line function
Without -ffreestanding:
   __builtin_foo():  Use the GCC built-in if possible, otherwise out- 
of-line
   foo():            Use the GCC built-in if possible, otherwise out- 
of-line
What's wrong with always specifying -ffreestanding and using  
__builtin_foo() instead of foo() where applicable?  That's what it  
was designed for, according to the GCC manual:
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.1.1/gcc/C-Dialect-Options.html#C-
 
Dialect-Options
If you want to unconditionally force a certain function to use the  
GCC built-in on a particular architecture, you could always just do  
this to get exactly the same result as without -ffreestanding:
#define memcpy(dest, src, len) __builtin_strcpy((dest), (src), (len))
#define memcmp(a, b, len) __builtin_strcmp((a), (b), (len))
[...]
Just stuff those types of defines in an x86-64 specific header  
somewhere and turn on -ffreestanding unconditionally; you'll fix all  
of the problems with MIPS, etc, without even changing the semantics  
on x86-64.
Cheers,
