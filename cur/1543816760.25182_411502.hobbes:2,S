Loading 'xt_tcpudp' module solves the problem. Thanks for the answer.
So, the problem was just that the new 'x_tables' module is loaded automatically
according to modules dependencies, but 'xt_tcpudp' is not.
As a result, an upgrade of the FullPliant user land tools is required in order
to force the 'xt_tcpudp' module to load before calling 'iptables' with
'--destination-port' option.
