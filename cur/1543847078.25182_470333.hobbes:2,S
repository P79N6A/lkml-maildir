My keyboard, a ps2 microsoftie thats about got the legends worn from the 
keycaps, has not exhibited any such behaviour.

No hardware updates here recently, the most recent addition being a wap11 
for my lappy.  And I believe that was up and running for at least 2 months 
before this started.  Mobo is an older (now) biostar, gig of ram, XP-2800 
Athlon, 333 fsb.  Accessory 4 port usb1.1 hub in front panel for usb 
expansion. 7 usb devices total.  But only 5 are alive ATM, and one of 
those doesn't properly ID itself, a pl2303 usb-seriel adaptor thats 
plugged in but not in use. $40 and it doesn't honor flow control either 
style or way.
Thanks Uwe.
