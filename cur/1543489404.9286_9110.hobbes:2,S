Hi.  As Linus has stated several times that he does not like any of the
implementations for ISA Plug and Play devices which are currently out
there (kernel-space), I have begun to try to work on one myself, mainly
for 2.3.x.  I currently have detection of devices and knowing what
resources they will accept and was wondering how people thought that the
actual allocation of resources should be handled.  Part of the problem
(IMO) with the current code is that it requires a) every driver to know
about plug and play or b) the plug and play to know about every driver.
Unfortunately, I've been unable to come up with a great way to get around
this and was wondering if anyone had any ideas. 
Thanks,
Jeremy Katz
