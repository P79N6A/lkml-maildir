These are harmless. I have one machine that generates them too.
I think they happen because the BIOS either does something
incorrectly while booting the POSting the CPU or these are
expected and it forgets to clear them. Only a few BIOS
seem to do it, so it is probably a BIOS bug. 
You see them because the MCE code logs boot MCEs now.
That is because it is the only way to log MCEs that 
cause the system to reboot is to log them after the reboot.
Some of the bit combinations are clearly non sensical, like
corrected ECC error with error uncorrected and the Address
is bogus.
I have been pondering to add some filter to remove
these bogus MCEs, but I have not come up with 
a good heuristic yet. Perhaps ignore all MCEs at resume
with addresses that are beyond the physical memory.
But that would not have caught the last one.
