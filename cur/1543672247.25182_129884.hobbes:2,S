That is true, but note that ALAS^H^HSA creates device nodes in /proc
manually.  IOW, removal of proc_mknod() won't solve anything.  The
real question is whether we should allow device nodes on procfs.
If we should not allow them, ALSA needs API changes.  If we should,
it'd be better to have creation of such nodes explicit (and if ALSA
keeps doing that, it should switch to calling proc_mknod()).
