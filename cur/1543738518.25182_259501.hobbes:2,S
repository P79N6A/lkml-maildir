I'm running it, and dl'ing the suse livecd-9.1 to test the burning 
sometime tomorrow.  About the only unusual thing I see in dmesg is:
-----------------
EXT3 FS on hda8, internal journal
EXT3-fs: mounted filesystem with ordered data mode.
EXT3-fs warning: maximal mount count reached, running e2fsck is 
recommended
kjournald starting.  Commit interval 5 seconds
EXT3 FS on hdd2, internal journal
EXT3-fs: mounted filesystem with ordered data mode.
EXT3-fs warning: maximal mount count reached, running e2fsck is 
recommended
kjournald starting.  Commit interval 5 seconds
-----------------
but it *didn't* ask me to hit y for the check while it was booting.
Also, the last couple of -rc's seem to be keeping a lock on /usr when 
shutting down, so the 3 attempts at a clean umount during the 
shutdown phase all fail.  I made sure that everything was stopped 
except some screen backgrounds that come from /usr, and gkrellm, 
which sits on every window here.  That hasn't bothered the reboots 
until maybe -rc2 but -rc3 for sure is doing it 100% of the time in 
the shutdown phase.
