What is "it" that gets put off until 2.5?  Breaking net drivers with an
interface upgrade, or eliminating this race?
I would prefer that 2.4.0 went out the door with a race-free netdev
interface.
Andrew's patch is nice and small, and doesn't -require- a driver
upgrade.  We can upgrade the important drivers now, and then do all the
stinkbomb crapola drivers during the 2.4.x series or whenever.
There is absolutely no need to break drivers for this.  Not only is it
needless pain, but doing so is inconsistent -- with struct
file_operations, I am free to have owner==NULL.
