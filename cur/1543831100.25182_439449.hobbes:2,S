Better management is a good reason.  But constructing the management in 
a way that hampers the implementation and confuses existing applications is
a problem.
Things are much easier if namespaces are completely independent.
Among other things the semantics are clear and obvious.

That or we setup the child and then drop CAP_NET_ADMIN.

I guess I was thinking from the performance and cleanliness point of
view.

If necessary.  But mostly we concentrate on the fundamentals and figure
out what it takes to take the level 2 stuff working.
