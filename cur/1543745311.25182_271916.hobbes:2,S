gcc-3.4.3 caveats:
While gcc-3.4.3 fixed the string literal parsing
bug I saw, which involved chunks of literal string
with escaped newlines sandwiched around repeated
instances of a string-valued macro and the whole
thing assigned directly as the value of a
const char *, 3.4.3 is more strict than gcc-3.3.x
about embedded, unescaped newlines.
In gcc-3.3.2, string literals like this merely
got a "deprecated" warning:
const char * msg = "hello
world";
gcc-3.4.3 refuses to parse that at all, reporting
a missing " error as soon as it sees the unescaped
newline after 'hello' (and then reporting itself
confused by the remainder of the source file).
(Recompiling a system full of old laissez faire
C applications code with gcc-3.4.3, there is going
to be some additional maintenance involved.)
gcc-3.4.3 also bloats the kernel a little.
While stripped application binaries
(-march=i686 -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing)
consistently end up smaller than they were
when compiled with gcc-2.95.3, a 2.4.28-rc3
kernel ended up 60k bigger with the same
.config.
