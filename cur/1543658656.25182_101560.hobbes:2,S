No. The original code used _absolute_ thresholds for the DTMF tones and
the harmonics. That did not work very well.
My simple patch added a relative energy comparision of the DTMF tones
and a simple plausibiltity check (DTMF is only accepted if there is
exactly one DTNF pair and no/low signal level on the other DTMF
frequencies. That worked with my (very limited) tests.

My patch did a first step in that direction, but took only the energy
on the DTMF frequencies. That does not seem to be sufficient.
Another thing which may improve resistance against false DTMF detection
would be to require more than one consecutive samples to contain a valid
DTMF tone. See the link in one of my posts on lkml.

That would be nice. But that must be a rather big chunk of data - the
Mitel tape alone contains 30 minutes of speech, the Bellcore tapes even
more. Too much for my dialup line, I'm afraid.
