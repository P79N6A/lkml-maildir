Ugh, so I'm having second thoughts about this patch.  I believe what is 
happening here is that the requeue loop requeues each waiter from one 
futex (key1) to another (key2).  It rightly takes a reference to the 
futex at key2 and then decrements the references to key1 by drop_count 
(since the waiters now reference key2, not key1).  The newly taken key2 
references will be dropped in futex_wait() when each waiter is woken up 
and takes the futex.
I apologize for the confusion on this.  Thanks for suggesting I send 
this patch out independently from the rest Peter ;-)
If we can come to a consensus on this, I suggest pulling this patch from 
tip/core/futexes.
