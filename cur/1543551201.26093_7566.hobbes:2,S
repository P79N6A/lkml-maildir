The spec talks about three types of connection - "40-wire assembly",
"80-wire assembly", both being three-connector cables with the
limitations you cite. Plus it talks about a "direct point-to-point
connection" for a single device case. There isn't any minimum length
specified for that case. This may be some relict in the spec, though.
