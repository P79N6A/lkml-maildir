Those are helpful inputs, but not good enough to produce a reliably
unique value.  Good randomness is better.
Your chances of a collision using the GPS coordinates, time _and_
network address together is significantly higher than a good 128-bit
random number.
This is why UUID generators typically combine some pseudo-random value
(which cannot be trusted to be properly random), and some fixed value,
such as network card MAC address, which is assumed to be unique (but
which isn't always, in practice).
Of course, public key systems don't use those parameters directly.
(They might as input entropy to a random number generator).  They can
be used to identify where you are, when you did it and who with :)
Example: MAC addresses in UUIDs are a way in which Microsoft Word
documents have revealed information about the person who wrote them :)
