In my case, the emu10k1 has an IRQ all to itself... (and I don't have
ACPI enabled).
Been running the kernel emu10k1 on test11-pre5 since this morning.
I've only had one lockup (older testX emu10k1's locked up more
frequently). So there still appears to be a problem with (or triggered by)
test11-pre5 emu10k1. As I was under X at that stage (XMMS & two xterms), I
did not see any panic()'s or BUG()'s.
Next I'm going to compile with serial console & see if I can see any
panic() or BUG()s.
