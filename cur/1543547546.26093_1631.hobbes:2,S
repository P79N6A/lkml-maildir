LINUX KERNEL PROBLEM REPORT
[1.] Megaraid driver in Linux 2.2.17pre20 hangs on "Blocked
mailbox......!!"
[2.] Full description of the problem:
After upgrading to Linux 2.2.17pre20, a medium loaded Squid proxy box
running on a DELL 2300 with a PERC Megaraid card hangs completely in the
megaraid driver.  The server doesn't even respond to pings. However, the
line "Blocked mailbox......!!" is written the console once every second.
Running on 2.2.16 and previous versions works fine, but 2.2.17pre20
hangs after 2-3 days uptime.
[3.] Keywords: dell, ami, megaraid, raid, scsi, driver, mailbox
[4.] Kernel version: 2.2.17pre20
[5.] N/A
[6.] N/A
[7] Environment:
DELL PERC Megaraid firmware U.81 Firmware 1.63
DELL 2300
[X.]  Other notes:
I am now running tests on the system using 2.2.18pre2 and Megaraid
Firmware U.84. I'll follow up if this configuration has problems as
well.
SUGGESTION: It would be nice if the drivers would prefix their message
with the driver name. "Mailbox blocked" does not make me think of a RAID
driver.
The link to Dell's support site in the megaraid.c source takes me to the
PERC/2 driver. It would be nice if there was a link to the updated
PERC/1 driver as well.
