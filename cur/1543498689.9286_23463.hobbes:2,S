[1.] One line summary of the problem:    
     module is not loaded when my hardware is off
[2.] Full description of the problem:
     I wrote a device driver ( for a little bit specific device -
     CAMAC interface adapter (ISA) ). Driver is written as a loadable
     module. The adapter is in the ISA slot and is connected with 
     the CAMAC crate controller by a cable. CAMAC crate has separate
     power source.
     When I load the driver by insmod command having the CAMAC crate
     powered on, it is loaded without a problem.
     If the power on the crate is off, I cannot load the driver.
     check_region(..) returns some non-zero value, so I have to exit.
     ( I call check_region() before doing anything with my board. )
     In this case insmod (?) tells (after my diagnostic message about
     inabilty to access i/o ports needed, see [7.5])
     /lib/modules/2.2.5-15/misc/apex.o: init_module: Device or resource busy.
     Moreover, after this happened I can switch the power on the crate
     on and off without any effect ( i.e I cannot load the module anymore )
     until the system is rebooted.
     Some interesting detail: after successfull loading (if the power
     was on) I can look at the file /proc/ioports and see
     ...
     100h-106h: apex
     120h-13eh: apex
     ...
     among other entries in this file. apex is my module name and
     ports specified are those which the adapter use, so everthing is OK.
     In the case when insmod fails to load the module ( power was off)
     any attempt to read the content of the /proc/ioports after that results
     in a OOPS message (see [5.] below). I tried to read the file
     by cat and with F3 in Midnight Commander with the same result. 
     This behaviour does not depend on weither the power on the crate
     was on or off during the system booting. What matters is that
     in order to load my driver I have got to turn my crate on
     before first attempt to do this.
     I looked at the kernel/resources.c, but did not find any i/o port
     related code in it. All functions there perform some manipulations
     with iolist and iotable. I mean check_region(), request_region(),
     release_region() and find_gap(). I have been using Unix/Linux only
     for half a year, so I can only guess that something
     in the kernel permanently does something with i/o ports and
     with those iolist and iotable, otherwise the behaviour of insmod 
     and/or  check_region() and/or get_ioport_list (?????)
     would not depend on weither the power on my crate is on or off.
     
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
     modules, driver, i/o ports, check_region(), /proc/ioports
     iolist, iotable in /usr/src/linux/kernel/resources.c
     
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
     Linux version 2.2.5-15 (root@porky.devel.redhat.com) 
     (gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)) 
     #1 Mon Apr 19 22:21:09 EDT 1999
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information 
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
I found the stuff below in /var/log/messages. It is the same
I see on the screen. Also I did nm vmlinux | sort | less
and EIP from dump om the screen point also somewhere in vsprintf.
Hope this is what you need.

     problem (if possible)
     I am afraid it is not possible: you do not have that adapter :-))).
