There is dev->broken_parity_status ... although exactly what the sematics
of that flag actually are seems to be rather vague - there's code which
sets it for the Mellanox Tavor device, but it seems to only be exposed
via sysfs - no code in drivers/pci seems to take any action based upon
this flag being set.
That rather raises the question about the usefulness of that quirk.
