sometimes it should, eg some of the ioctls that read data via special
commands from the drive that could also use byteswapping - ide-smart 
comes to my mind.
Btw the Q40 has also byteswapped IDE bus like the atari.
We already have atapi_{input|output}_bytes bytes that does the
swapping, and m68k has {ins|outs}[wl]_swapw. Perhaps one of this 
could be reused to do the bswap?
