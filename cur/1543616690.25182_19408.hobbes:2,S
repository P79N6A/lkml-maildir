top# insmod /lib/modules/2.4.17/misc/cipcb.o
/lib/modules/2.4.17/misc/cipcb.o: unresolved symbol sk_run_filter
/lib/modules/2.4.17/misc/cipcb.o: Note: modules without a GPL compatible license cannot use GPLONLY_ symbols
running CIPE 1.5.2 I get the error above.  Should I be bother the
CIPE people with this?  Or is this some kernel thingy that needs
to be dealt with?
I remember reading on l-k a few times some stuff about GPLONLY_
but I have no idea what to do now that I've run into whatever
the problem is that is caused by this?
CIPE is a GPL'ed program.
