Well here is more crap then...
kobjects corresponding to /sys/class/tty/* and /sys/class/net/* have the
same kset (i.e class_obj) but totally different attributes. There is no
way to find the attributes given a kobject belonging to lets say 
/sys/class/net/eth0 except through the hierarchy maintained in pinned sysfs 
dentries.
