The usual form is, I believe,
	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/willy/misc.git dmapool
Otherwise people get all confused and think it's an empty tree (like I just
did).

Could we please at least have a shortlog so we can find out what the patch
titles are so we can google them so we can find out what the heck you're
proposing we add to the kernel?

It shouldn't be this hard!
There were no replies to v2 of the patch series.  It all looks reasonable
from a quick scan (assuming the patches are unchanged since then).
afaik these patches have been tested by nobody except thyself?
