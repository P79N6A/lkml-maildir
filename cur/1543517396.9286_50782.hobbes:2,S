AFAIK volatile is not enough to get _asm_ to do the right thing.
volatile guarantees visibility, but in this case it's atomicity that has
to be guaranteed.
If volatile causes asm "m" constraints to always use the original memory
location, that would be quite useful but it is not documented to do so.
