I have proposed the following patch to Ted for inclusion into the
serial driver. It adds:
- support for 16C654 uarts (they have 64 bytes of fifo)
- support for the 18C850/4 uarts
- support for PCI based multiport serial adapters

This patch is against 2.2.10, but should apply cleanly
to any of the 2.[23].x kernels. I've tested 2.2.5, 2.2.10,
2.3.9 and 2.3.10.
I'd like to hear from people who use this patch; bugs,
improvements, feature requests.
If you're interested in being an official beta tester
(which may include free hardware), please contact me.
Yes, I am being paid to support this and yes, Connect
Tech is releasing this patch under GPL.
