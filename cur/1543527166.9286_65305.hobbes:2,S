Andris, do you use smbfs?
I found the first codepath that could cause your problems:
Within net bottom half handler:
ip_rcv()
 calls ip_local_deliver()
 calls tcp_v4_rcv()
 calls tcp_v4_do_rcv()
 calls tcp_rcv_established()
 calls sk->data_ready
could be smb_data_callback()	[in fs/smbfs/sock.c]
 calls _recvfrom()
 calls socket->ops->recvmsg()
could be inet_recvmsg
 calls tcp_recvmsg !!!!! < this must not be called from an BH.
Ok, it seems that smb_data_callback() is broken in 2.2.14.
It cannot read the data directly, it must wake the waiting thread up,
and the thread must call recvmsg() at process level.
