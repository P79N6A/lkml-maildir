Subject: Quota and Q_SYNC - broken

Can someone please fill me in on two questions?
1)  Why did the Q_SYNC and friends constants get changed?  I have old 
binaries that don't work anymore, and in fact, new binaries don't work 
either unless I update my sys/quota.h.
2)  Does quoatctl(Q_SYNC) still work with a NULL special (meaning sync 
all quotas)?  The man page has it listed, but it seems to be broken.
I'll provide a patch for the second, if someone wants to point out why 
the first was broken (braindead) and what the preferred solution is.
Thanks.
Tim
