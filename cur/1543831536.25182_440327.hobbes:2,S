Subject: -git: strange dependency for EMBEDDED6xx
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Commit c5d56332fd6c2f0c7cf9d1f65416076f2711ea28 contained the following:
 config EMBEDDED6xx
        bool "Embedded 6xx/7xx/7xxx-based board"
-       depends on PPC32 && BROKEN
+       depends on PPC32 && (BROKEN||BROKEN_ON_SMP)
This looks very strange.
This dependency is equivalent to
	depends on PPC32 && SMP=n
Was this the intention?
Or what else was the intention?
