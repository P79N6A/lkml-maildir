Thank you!  I knew there might be a more efficient way to do that, so 
I'm glad I sent that to LKML for you to see ;-)
Still, I think it should be added into the documentation somewhere... 
I'd be happy to submit a patch, I just don't know where it should go.  
Obviously, this is specific to -mm kernels only.  Do you know?
