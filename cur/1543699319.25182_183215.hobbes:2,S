In proc_resetdevice() ... after usb_reset_device().
If usb_reset_device() worked sanely, it wouldn't be
necessary to try fixing up its result.  Plus, last I
looked, I don't think usbfs fixed it up correctly.
Actually that call is dangerous and probably should
fail if usbfs isn't controlling all the interfaces
on the device ... checking before it tries.
> usb_reset_device
We've known for some time this routine needs a rewrite.
It's never quite worked right, and it doesn't handle
DFU style devices (like the most common USB 802.11b
adapters) well at all.
> usb_set_configuration
That is, you're saying that _if_ usbfs is modified to
get rid of ps->devsem and use dev->serialize instead,
then you'd need some other way to guard proc_setconfig()
against disconnect?  That still seems like a chicken/egg
issue to me.
> usb_unbind_interface
See the patch I posted yesterday evening, with usbfs parts
of the updates to driver binding.  It's incorrect for usbfs
ever to be calling that ... device_release_driver() is the
thing to call, for drivers that weren't bound using the
usb_driver_claim_interface() call.  That way the sysfs
state also gets cleaned up ...
