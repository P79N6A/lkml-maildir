I'm not aware of what kind of symtoms the bug shoud have caused, but it seems
that it fixed at least one on my 2.2.1-ac5. Before, the mounts would drop when 
NT peer would close the socket. After this, any access to the mount -- ls, cd, 
umount, or even df -- would hang and refuse to obey SIGKILL. After applying the 
patch, the mounts still drop, but the hanging processes can be SIGINT'ed. 
Moreover the processes seem to hang less often. I seem to remember similar
enhancement updating from 2.0.34 to 2.0.36 -- perhaps there was a similar
change in the code?
The dropping mounts, however, were not cured. With 2.0.36 there is no problem
with NT (or other smb server) closing the socket -- smbfs seems to transparently
reconnect when needed. With 2.2.1, the mounts drop after few minutes of idle time
when NT closes the socket. (With samba, the problem does not show up, at least 
that often, since samba does not close the socket all that often.) I suppose this 
behaviour has something to do with the recent smbfs delayed mount discussion. As
I understood, in 2.0 the smbmount would fork a child that did remounting in the 
background every time smbfs asked it to. Now that the smbmount scheme has changed, 
this does not happen any more, am I correct?
There's yet one more thing strange thing with smbfs. I use ssh to create a secure 
channel through which I -- among other things -- mount shares with smbfs. If the 
throughput without ssh is, say, 200KB/s, through ssh it is only 20-40KB/s. With
smbclient, however, the throughput only drops to something like 180KB/s. With 
sharity through ssh, the performance is ~150KB/s. The slowdown is not specific to
ssh tunneling, tunneling through socket (the executable that creates a socket to 
a specific destination) had similar effect. I seem to remember that NT had 
similar loss of smb performance when tunneling through ssh (which was a heck of
a battle to get working at the first place.)
Obviously, there is something in the smbfs code that causes the tunneling to be 
slow. I took a quick look, but did not find anything. Could anyone point me 
an exact spot to suspect, so I could compare that to the smbclient equivalent.
