        presumably you loose 2k at the top because the bios is doing
        something with it

I'm not sure where above the video memory resides, probably in the
last usable section looking at the size of it, but I don't see why it
should be marked as usable then.  Also, if it was being misreported, I
would expect running X and such like to clobber kernel buffers
eventually and cause all sorts of nasties (like disk corruption).
Was does lspci -v report for the video (VGA Adapters) address? You
might also be able to find this from the XF86 startup session.
Also, can you try adding a line like:
        mempages >>= 1;
to the start of fs/dcache.c:dcache_init(...) after the variable
delcaration obviously and see if that helps at all?
