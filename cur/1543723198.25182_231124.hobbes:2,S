Yes, I've seen this declared in other reports too.
It probably means just that for window scales of 0..2 the misinterpretation
does not result in a too-small-to-send-data window.
But I'm still confused that the scaled window is being given to the
receiver, and this makes the connection freeze.  I wonder if there is
a queer box doing NAT or similar in front of the gentoo machine which
either:
1) Applies any window scaling to both directions
2) Applies window scaling to the wrong direction
and uses this to "help" with dropping of out-of-window TCP segments.
