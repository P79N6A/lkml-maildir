Then as we say, set up routing properly.  Specify the correct source to be used
on a route rather than the implicit primary interface address.
ip r a d.e.f.0 dev int0 src d.e.f.1, and assuming the .0 represents the network,
all traffic destined to this network not having an explicit source will get
assigned the route source and appear as d.e.f.1 on the wire.
