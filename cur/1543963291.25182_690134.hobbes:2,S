Well, actually the other functions like oprofile_add_trace are using the 
&__get_cpu_var(cpu_buffer) construct.

Here they are:
/home/jroth/kernel/spufs/arch/powerpc/oprofile/../../../drivers/oprofile/cpu_buffer.c: 
In function ‘oprofile_add_value’:
/home/jroth/kernel/spufs/arch/powerpc/oprofile/../../../drivers/oprofile/cpu_buffer.c:234: 
error: ‘cpu_buffer’ undeclared (first use in this function)
cpu_buffer is defined by the DEFINE_PER_CPU_SHARED_ALIGNED macro:
DEFINE_PER_CPU_SHARED_ALIGNED(struct oprofile_cpu_buffer, cpu_buffer);
