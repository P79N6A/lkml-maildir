Thats what is happening currently. However it is being done piece by
piece, slowly and carefully.

You should follow l/k more closely. Since 2.6.15 Paul Fulghum and I have
completely rewritten the entire buffering logic. In 2.6.14 or so I
rewrote the line discipline locking and support code.
One hint by the way - stop looking at locks and code, look at locks and
data structures. There is an old saying "lock data not code" and it
really is true if you want to follow the locking and get it right.
The open/close/hangup logic is last on the list to fix, because as
you've noticed its the most horrible. Once the other locking is sane
that bit should become more managable even with the strict and bizarre
rules POSIX and SuS enforce on us in this area.
