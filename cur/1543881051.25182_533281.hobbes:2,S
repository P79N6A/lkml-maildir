Subject: [PATCH] ieee1394: more help in Kconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/21/151

  - s/Device Drivers/Controllers/
  - clarify who needs pcilynx
  - don't recommend Y for raw1394; M is typically used
