From the reports it seems pretty consistent. I guess it could well
be something that may occur with SLAB *if the conditions are a bit
different*...

But page allocs from slab isn't where the OOMs are occurring, so this
seems unlikely (also, the all_unreclaimable logic now should be pretty
strict, so you have to really run the machine out of memory (1GB of
swap gets fully used, then his DMA32 zone is scanned 8 times without
reclaiming a single page).
That said, parallel kernel compiling can really change a lot in memory
footprint depending on small variations in timing. So it might not be
anything to worry about.
