I thought about this: I agree it doesn't look as neat, but "hard to
read" for what purpose?  It's just as easy to find a particular field
you're looking for and it's just as easy to find the end of the
declaration: I couldn't come up with a convincing argument for needing
to skim-read these declarations, so I didn't complain to the author.
Rusty.
