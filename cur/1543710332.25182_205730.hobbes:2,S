Sorry, I meant to check that one against the docs.
The patch is wrong.  For 3c905B, the transceiver select bits are
InternalConfig:20-23 and for 3c590 the transceiver select bit are
InternalConfig:20-22.
That patch thinks the transceiver select bits are bits 21 to 36 of a 32-bit
register so no, it won't work very well.
