I am a newbie to the linux-kernel mailing list; however, I don't think
that system calls to the kernel for status info will be developed.
The point of /proc is to provide user space access to this information
without having to make syscalls to the kernel.

Granted there is some "overhead" in creating the filehandles, but I
think /proc is the preferred way to go.
