If I remember correctly, folks were complaining that boot time was
drifting due to the same issue. 
So yes, a full rework of the time subsystem is needed, but it alone
won't fix all of these problems, its just the first step. Once we have a
sane time base that isn't dependent on regular timer ticks, we then need
to make the timer subsystem and every other subsystem to use that time
base instead of Jiffies/HZ. 
This isn't going to happen instantly by any means. I'm trying to get the
time of day rework finished as soon as I can, but I've got the day job
to do as well. In the mean time, we can staple gun any user visible
exported HZ/jiffies values so they are accurate (using ACTHZ or
gettimeofday), and also look into changing HZ to a less error-ful
value.  HZ=1001 has been suggested and looks quite promising (although
/net/schec/estimator.c wants a power of 4).
