So you want your system to hang in a deadlock... forcing you to
press the reset button to restart....

thats what happens, sort of, if the kernel isn't allowed to kill
off some processes. Just fsck every filesystem that was mounted...

First time it happened to me I wanted global user resource limits on memory
so that I would get notified when I was going over available memory. The
quota should be about 5-10MB less than physical maximum (say 1-5% of total
reserved for root). That way support daemons don't have to be killed
(the X server for instance) and I know (and processes know) when the
resources are no longer available.
