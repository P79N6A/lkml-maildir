I have a Compaq Presario 425 here, with a K5 upgrade (by Evergreen
Technologies) in it. It reboots immediately after "Booting the kernel..."
with Linux 2.4.0test10 (I haven't tried test11preX on this machine) if the
kernel is compiled for 586/K5/etc. If I compile for 486, then it boots. If
I compile for 586/K5/etc. with 2.2.17, it boots. (This is all with egcs
1.1.2.)
Is this a real bug or just a documentation bug?
