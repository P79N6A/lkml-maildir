It is probably lock-break, not preempt.  I don't have lock-break patches
for 2.4.19-pre yet.  Lock-break/low-latency and the more general lock
breaking / explicit schedule work is very reliant on the version of the
kernel they were designed against.  This is why this approach is not a
proper long-term solution ...
