There are keyboards (USB, PS2) with Sleep and Suspend buttons
that are not related to ACPI nor APM. We had 2 options - add
an input handler that would translate input events into ACPI
events and feed /proc/acpi/event[*] or go other way around and
use input layer for delivering suspend and sleep requests for
all types of keyboards/buttons, including ACPI buttons. The
secons option is better because userspace solution using input
layer will not be tied to a particular technology (ACPI) and
can be used on other platforms as well.

[*] Embedded people are not particularly interested in
processing suspend requests in userspace and would rather
do it right in the kernel. I am about to apply a patch
from Richard Purdie that adds transaltion from input events
into APM events.
