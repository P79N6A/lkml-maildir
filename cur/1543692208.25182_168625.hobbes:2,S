This is the fix that went into test5-bk11?  Now that i2c seems to be 
initilising properly again I've been able to test it in bk13.  I get exactly 
the same results as before the patch.  BTW, something I should have mentioned 
before is that this is on an XFS partition.
Just did a slightly different test and got this from it...

Note it *does* come up as euid root.
$ sync

But not after it has been synced.  Odd, but that's how it works.
As I said before it seems to me that this is coming from an old cached version 
of the directory entry.  As such that version will need to be cleared from 
the cache at the same time as updating the s(ug)id data on the file system 
itself.
