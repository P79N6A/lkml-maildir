Indeed.  Which means that the compiler almost certainly would have
done the wrong thing in certain cases with the conditional lvalue
extension.
There were real, hard to fix bugs here.  Rather than sweat too much
about what the "right" semantics are supposed to be, and how to get
them all "correct", we just removed the ill-thought extension.

In ANSI C you've no alternative except memcpy, since you can't cast
the pointer and reference the object via some other type (assuming
neither type is char, yadda yadda).
