I'm glad you bring that up, actually. One of the "downsides" of the new
unplugging is that it really requires anyone waiting for IO in a path
like the file system or device driver to use io_schedule() instead of
schedule() to get the blk_replug_current_nested() done to avoid
deadlocks. While it is annoying that it could introduce some deadlocks
until we get things fixed it, I do consider it a correctness fix even in
the generic kernel, as you are really waiting for IO and as such should
use io_schedule() in the first place.
Perhaps I should add a WARN_ON() check for this to catch these bugs
upfront.

Can you try io_schedule() and verify that things just work?
