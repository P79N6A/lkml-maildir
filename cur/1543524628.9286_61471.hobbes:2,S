I double checked __pollwait() again, and now I see a problem:
there is no error handling! If gfp() return NULL, then __pollwait() will
ignore that file, and thus poll will wait _without_ a wait-queue. The
bug is so obvious that I didn't notice it when I saw the bug report on
l-l a few days ago.
I've already forward-ported the patch to 2.3, and I'll post it in a few
hours.
