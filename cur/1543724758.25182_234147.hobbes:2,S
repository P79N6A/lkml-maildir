Subject: [PATCH] - trivial comment fixups in init/main.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/7/13/159

This patch has some trivial comment fixups for init/main.c, to bring
the comments into consistency with the coding style of the kernel.
These modifications were originally made by Adam Kropelin
These came to our attention while working on a patch to
calibrate_delay(), and I thought we should separate these
changes from that patch.
The patch applies silently against 2.6.7 and cleanly but
with hunk offsets to 2.6.7-bk20.
