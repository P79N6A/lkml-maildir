Not as well as I'd like, I'll admit.  I really couldn't find any
standard benchmark that would push the TCP hashes hard.

16K pages on IA64.  As the patch currently stands x86-64 and ppc64
would not be a concern, as we still use the old behavior by default
for those architectures.  Only IA64 NUMA kernel configurations will
have this on by default.  Additionally, this only affects NUMA machines,
and I'm not aware of any x86-64 architectures of that nature (please
educate me if I'm mistaken).

I'll look into running that, but have my doubts as to whether I
can scare up appropriate quantities/types of hardware.
