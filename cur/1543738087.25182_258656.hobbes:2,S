Ok I've pondered this somewhat. I don't think the hack proposed is the
right answer for this. I believe you should implement a simple line
discipline for this device so that it stays out of the general code.
Right now that poses a challenge but if drivers were to implement
ldisc->modem_change() or a similar callback for such events an ldisc
could then handle many of the grungy suprises and handle them once and
in one place.
Thoughts ?
