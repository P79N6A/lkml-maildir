In general, "exit 1" (newline shouldn't be needed unless the shell is buggy).
bash allows a smaller variant: "! :" (again, newline optional).
I've seen somewhere a shell that lets you save an extra byte by using "let
1", but the ones I tested set an exit status of 0 for that (which is arguably
more correct).  (The shell in question predefined an "alias false='let 1'"
IIRC.)
I don't know of any smaller versions.  That doesn't mean they don't exist...
someone somewhere may have a shell with a :-equivalent which returns a
nonzero exit status.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
