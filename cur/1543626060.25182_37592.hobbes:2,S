Well, these boards use KL133s (not KM133s).  The KL133 also has an
integrated S3 ProSavage card.
Maybe another bit seems to need setting somewhere.  But where?

I've been told the same.  Clearing bit 5 is apparently necessary to
prevent IDE crruption.  Asus lists two motherboards, one with a KL133,
one with a KL133A.  It looks like the motherboards using KL133s are
broken, and the KL133As work.
How bad is "not clearing bit 5"?
How bad is 
  if ((device_id = kl133) || (device_id = km133)) {
     /* Don't clear bit 5 */
  }
Is it possible to clear bit 5, but not bit X, to fix it?
