Actually you will have a VERY hard time getting it to roll over.  Issues
of your life time, not to mention the hardware's life time.  64 bits
makes a VERY large number and you are counting in 427 day increments. 
Remember we have been counting seconds since 1970 in 32 bits and
rollover is still, most likely, beyond the capability of any machine
running today to get to.  Now consider counting in 427 day increments
instead of seconds.
