This is almost certainly the biggest brainfuck in the x86-64
architecture.  It should have been supported to set the segment
registers via "movq rm64,%fs|gs" (i.e. REX64 MOV sr,r/m64).  Barring
that, it would have been better if *all* setting of the segment
registers from userspace had been completely outlawed, so the kernel
at least could have tracked the usage.  The combination is in so many
ways worse than ever.
IMNSHO we should assume in the ABI that this will be fixed at some
point, and therefore we shouldn't work too hard to create kluges that
are based on warts in the first x86-64 generation (K8) only, that
later can't be fixed.
There is plenty of reason to believe the x86-64 architecture will be
around for a long time to come.  It is more important to create sane
ABIs than it is for those ABIs to be microoptimized to the first
generation of x86-64 processors.
