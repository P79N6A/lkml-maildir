hba is decalred as
static ctlr_info_t *hba[MAX_CTLR]
So if I change the cmd_pool_bits to embed the DECLARE_BITMAP
statement, while compiling this file as a module, is there not a
chance of cmd_pool_bits cross a page boundary and allocated in two non
contiguous (physical) pages? Would it cause a problem with
__find_fist_zero_bit() and friends?
