Huh?  The device can't generate any legacy interrupts once MSI is
enabled.  As the PCI spec says:
    "While enabled for MSI or MSI-X operation, a function is prohibited
    from using its INTx# pin (if implemented) to request service (MSI,
    MSI-X, and INTx# are mutually exclusive)."
Although the MSI core does do pci_intx() for PCIe devices only, for
some reason I can't grok.

Actually NVidia/AMD was working on some systems long before that -- I
had it working at least 2 years ago.
