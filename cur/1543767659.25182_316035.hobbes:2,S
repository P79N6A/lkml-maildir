Hi Ladislav, hi all,
> Chip is searched by bus number rather than its own proprietary id.
Yes, I think it makes much more sense (especially since the proprietary
id was not known by anyone outside of the ds1337 driver).
I think I understand that ds1337_do_command() will be called from some
other kernel driver. Why isn't it exported then? I'd expect:
EXPORT_SYMBOL(ds1337_do_command);
next to the end of the ds1337 driver. Maybe it would also make sense to
have a ds1337.h header file declaring this function?
Additionally, I would welcome an additional patch documenting the fact
that the ds1337 driver will work fine with the Dallas DS1339 real-time
clock chip.
Thanks,
