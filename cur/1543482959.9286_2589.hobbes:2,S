I'd much rather just use some stale "struct task_struct" data.
What we _might_ do in /proc, is to just increment the usage count for the
(double) page that contains the task structure, so that even if a
release() does happen while we're using the page, the page won't get
re-used, and we can essentially look at all the info as it was when it was
released. 
Note that by the time it has become a zombie, it will have released all
the mm stuff anyway, so we don't even have any dangerous stale mm pointers
that we'd follow: we'd only be looking at that one structure. 
Voila, no memcpy(), no silly locks, no problems. 
Anyway, for 2.2.1 I don't even want to be clever. As it is (with the bogus
array.c race "fixes" removed), the page may get freed without any kernel
lock, and we may return _completely_ bogus information, but that is (a) 
extremely unlikely in the first place and (b) basically harmless and
pretty much impossible to exploit.
