Hi guys,
# cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr
218374  17929   1000000
This looks wrong to me. I am constantly increasing /proc/sys/fs/file-max 
because of "Too many open files in system" error in application. Application 
itself doesn't have file handle leak: it's multi-processes(not threads) based 
and the main process doesn't open any socket, only children do and they don't 
live for long.
