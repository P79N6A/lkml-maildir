It requires 32GB's worth of pte's.
So yeah, it might be possible on a 64GB ia32 box.

The overflow can happen in any get_page(), anywhere.  If we wanted to check
for it in this manner I guess we could do
	if (page_count(page) > (unsigned)-1000)
		barf();
in the pagefault handler.
But I don't think it's a serious issue on 32-bit machines, and on 64 bit
machines the 64-bit counter kinda makes sense?
