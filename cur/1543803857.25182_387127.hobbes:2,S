Don't reassign the pid at all. Keep task->container and do the job
explicitly. Most task searches for a pid are abstracted already and most
users of ->pid who try and use it for comparing two tasks for equality
or for keeping a task reference are already terminally racey and want
fixing anyway.
It raises a few other minor questions - one is /proc - but if container
0 was the usual one then putting the other containers into a subdir
would break nothing. Alternatively proc could allow multiple mounts and
a container = option to get the fs view right in chroot trees. The
subdirectories would be nice for management views.
You'd also need some process management items for other contexts - kill
etc but most of that can be done just by having a fork_into_container()
ability.
