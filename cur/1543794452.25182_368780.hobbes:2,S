	This didn't applied at V4L tree. This flag was removed at the latest
version. We had already a patch including static on some I2C structs and
other trivial fixes.
I'll added your patch with fixes on my tree and send to -mm in the next
V4L patchsets, after the patch that removes position and fixes some
stuff at saa7134-alsa.
Cheers, 
Mauro.
