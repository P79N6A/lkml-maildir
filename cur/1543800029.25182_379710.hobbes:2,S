Looks good to me, except for the coding style. Also, depending on both
SND and SOUND doesn't make much sense, as SND itself already depends on
SOUND, so we can simplify the SAA7134_ALSA dependency list.
Linus, can you please apply this patch before releasing 2.6.15?
Thanks.
Fix the cyclic dependency issue between CONFIG_SAA7134_ALSA and
CONFIG_SAA7134_OSS (credits to Mauro Carvalho Chehab.)
