Your countermeasures to optimized dictionary attacks are suboptimal. The
following code is from your util-linux patch:
 aes_encrypt(&ctx, &loopinfo.lo_encrypt_key[ 0], &loopinfo.lo_encrypt_key[ 0]);
 aes_encrypt(&ctx, &loopinfo.lo_encrypt_key[16], &loopinfo.lo_encrypt_key[16]);
 /* exchange upper half of first block with lower half of second block */
 memcpy(&tempkey[0], &loopinfo.lo_encrypt_key[8], 8);
 memcpy(&loopinfo.lo_encrypt_key[8], &loopinfo.lo_encrypt_key[16], 8);
 memcpy(&loopinfo.lo_encrypt_key[16], &tempkey[0], 8);
Symmetric block ciphers can't be used as hashing per se. Neither seems the
swapping scheme you're using to be a standard hash construction for ciphers.
I suggest to read "Applied Cryptography", Bruce Schneier, "18.11 One-Way
hash functions using symmetric block algorithms" as an introduction to that
topic. To avoid this troubles all together, I recommend to use a standard
MAC instead.
Further, the iteration depth of 10^5 seems to be insufficient.

Everyone attending a rhetoric seminar learns, "If you run out of
arguments, attack the person itself". The attacks, you're speaking of in
the next paragraph, apply to the key deduction. That's very different
from IV deduction.

As I said, not cryptoloop's responsibility.

Please read my mails carefully. See the following paragraph:

You are talking about util-linux again. Rusuu, don't try to fool the
audience by arguing for something totally different. Further if you try to
provide evidence for something, provide an URL to back your claims. I wasn't
able to find any mails in the archives dealing with that topic.
