Yah, I guess, but that isn't pretty at all ;)
Andrew, remember how we used to do it (and still do it in the 2.4
patch)?  Wouldn't that work?  Specifically, when we enter
preempt_schedule we set a flag value in preempt_count.  This flag value
is checked at the top of schedule and, if set, we skip the first chunk
of code that handles sleeping tasks.  The task->state never changes. 
Upon leaving schedule and returning to preempt_schedule, we unset the
flag.
This allows us to preempt tasks in any state, without problems or
special cases.  It also wasn't too much overhead - compared to now,
basically just:
	if (unlikely(current->preempt_count() & PREEMPT_ACTIVE))
		goto pick_next_task;
at the top of schedule().
