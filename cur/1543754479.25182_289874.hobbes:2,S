Hi Ram,
I can't speak for Al, but the following is how I understand it:

Although Al hasn't explicitly defined the semantics for mount
- --make-shared, I think the idea is that 'only' that mountpoint becomes
tagged as shared (becomes a member of a p-node of size 1).  The
- --make-shared / --make-private / --make-slave should probably all be
non-recursive actions.
/tmp/mnt1/mnt1.1 and /tmp/mnt1/mnt1.1/mnt1.1.1 will remain private.
The --rbind is described as simply walking the vfsmount tree rooted at
the argument and performing --bind.
So:
- - /tmp/mnt2 becomes a peer of /tmp/mnt1, because /tmp/mnt1 was in a
non-empty p-node.
- - /tmp/mnt2/mnt1.1 becomes a copy of /tmp/mnt1/mnt1.1 because the latter
was not in a p-node.
- - /tmp/mnt2/mnt1.1.1 becomes a copy of /tmp/mnt1/mnt1.1/mnt1.1.1 because
the latter was not in a p-node.
Only new mounts placed on top of /tmp/mnt1 and /tmp/mmnt2 will get
propagated back and forth.

EINVAL.  You should only be able to demote a mountpoint to a slave if it
was part of a p-node (shared).
