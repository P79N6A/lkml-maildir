They're usually not insane. xAPIC's have 8-bit physical ID's, not 4-bit,
but no one's bothered tracking whether the APIC's found were serial APIC
or xAPIC, and then dispatching on that in the IO-APIC physid check to
avoid unnecessarily renumbering the things or panicking.
This is my longstanding complaint regarding APIC_BROADCAST_ID being wrong.
