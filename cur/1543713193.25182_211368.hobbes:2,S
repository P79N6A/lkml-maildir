From a very superficial examination of your data, it looks like there is
something going wrong in the interrupt handling of the driver for (one
of) the network cards.
Distcc can generate a lot of network traffic. You might experiment with
switching the role of the two network cards (in case there might be
something wrong with the hardware of one of them) or use the '--listen'
directive in the distccd configuration to do so.
If the panic is indeed caused by the network driver, then it should also
be possible to trigger and debug this with a tool like netcat (listen on
the panicking box with 'nc -l someport' and send some stuff from another
box ('cat /dev/zero | nc panicker someport' or vice versa).
Sadly, nothing of this will solve your problem of course, but it might
pinpoint the cause somewhat more accurately, leading hopefully to a
solution!
