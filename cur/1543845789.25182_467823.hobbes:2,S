Subject: [PATCH] IPv6/DCCP: Remove unused IPV6_PKTOPTIONS code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/29/101

>  Coverity found what looks like a real leak in net/dccp/ipv6.c::dccp_v6_do_rcv()
|  otoh, it seems to me that opt_skb doesn't actually do anything and can be
|  removed?
This is right, there is no code referencing opt_skb: compare with net/ipv6/tcp_ipv6.c.
Until someone has time to add the missing DCCP-specific code, it does seem better
to replace the dead part with a FIXME. This is done by the patch below, applies to
davem-net2.6 and has been tested to compile.
