SInce this continues to be promulgated .. I'll say this in public:
      Do NOT quote without asking permission to quote.
Ask the people concerned if they can be quoted in the way you want
to quote them. You do not want to use out of context quotes and you
will be in trouble if you do. If you receive their permission,
hang on to it. If you hear nothing, consult your lawyer friends.

It is not a "microsoft" quote.  It is a quote from an individual in a
leaked document.  He's a human being.  Ask him if you can use this quote
as one of several in a press release. He did not write this as part
of a book chapter that he intended for publication, so its status
is murky.
