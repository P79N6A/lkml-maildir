Looks like we are in a deadlock here :)
However you choose to call it, it is unacceptable IMO.

So the userspace filesystem would pass that amount to the kernel. It's 
not pretty, but it is workable.

This looks like a bug to me. Maybe jiggling the thresholds would help.

The situation with userspace filesystems is:
  some process allocates memory, blocking on kswapd as memory is full
  kswapd calls userspace filesystem to free memory
  userspace filesystem calls kernel, which allocates memory and blocks 
on kswapd
  eventually all processes in the system block on kswapd
I have observed (and fixed) this on a real system.
with ramfs, once it accounts for memory, there would be no deadlock and 
no oom.
