I was thinking about driver programming of a device on the board that sends
interrupt requests to the PLX-9050. I got bit by a UART that powered on to
an 
interrupt signaling mode that caused the 9050 to continuously assert an 
interrupt request on the PCI bus. This was not a 9050 setup issue. I hope 
that your board does not have any issues like that.

When we updated our 9050 based card for hot-swap, we selected the PLX-9030 
which is a compatible, but newer, part. It incorporates all of the CPCI 
hot-swap infrastructure, even small stuff like ejector switch debouncing.
