The kernel rarely has a need to actually read or write the page's contents
with the CPU.  On those occasions where it does, it will use kmap.  Search
for zero_user_page() and kmap in rc7-mm1's fs/buffer.c
But that's file pagecache, which can be in highmem.  File metadata is accessed
within the filesystems without kmapping.  This:
box:/usr/src/linux-2.6.21-rc7> grep '[-]>b_data' fs/*/*.c | wc -l 
1017
explains why that never got fixed.
