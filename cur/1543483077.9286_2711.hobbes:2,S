Sure, if you look at my last email to Linus, you'll see that I am _only_
talking about getting the mm of a random process (not the current one!).
Probably I should comment better my patches, but I have really a big
leakage of spare time these days but I _don't_ want to decrease the kernel
hacking (even if Linus asked me to go away two times).

Infact, the only bugfix is array.c (as I just pointed out clearly in
bugtraq). Another reason I didn't either checked about lock_kernel() two
night ago before adding mm_lock, is that it was very late, I had a little
time and I seen some bugreport on the list that was oopsing in mmput (so I
thought "yeah, I seen the race!", I thought it was the mmput/current->mm =
&init_mm race). Then I also seen the mm->count as atomic_t so I thought it
was really the case. 
Ah note, there was overhead also in the overhead since checking for
mm->count == 0 in mmget was a nono ;).

Ok this is a completly different story and I am the first that don't want
to continue it now, but I want to point out that atomic_t is __far__ to be
the only thing we'll nee to make the mm_struct browsing race free (as I
understood from Linus's word).
I am very very happy to see that I was not (completly ;) crazy.
