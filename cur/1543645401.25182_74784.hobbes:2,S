Joe Thornber sent a patch removing LVM1, but LVM2 has yet to
make an appearance in 2.5.x patchform afair.  LVM is in one of
those sneaky positions where they could theoretically cheat
the feature freeze, as whats in the tree right now is fubar,
and we need /something/ before going 2.6/3.0.
It'd be nice to get /something/ in before the feature freeze so
people can bang on this after halloween when we ramp up stability
testing instead of waiting until the last minute.
There are some patches in -dj which make the existing LVM1 code
compile and 'sort of' work, but they're not fit for inclusion imo.
