You can just change the HZ to 1000 (or 1024) in include/asm-i386/param.h.
This however will break some userspace apps that assume HZ==100 in that they
will report wrong times. Also some places in the kernel might not be
completely HZ!=100 clean.
Artur Skawina <skawina@geocities.com> has a patch to address these problems.
Ask him. (Sorry: I don't know if he set up a web page.)
