My problems with ENOPROTOOPT were due to lack of coffee.  They were
caused by ICMP protocol unreachable responses from the test server
because I'd taken away it's pppd.  My mistake.

I've tested this now with a host running kernel 2.6.13 with Matt's
SC_MUST_COMP patch to the kernel and to ppp 2.4.4b1, sending SIGUSR2 to
the pppd while flooding the connection with pings from the server.
The result is an LCP TermReq from the server to the client, after which
no further data packets appear.  All the data packets up to the LCP
TermReq are encrypted.  The client sends an LCP TermAck, then takes down
the interface.  There's sign of CCP down, in that a CCP ConfReq appears
from the server just after the LCP TermReq.
I'm not sure this is an adequate test, and will take advice on that.
Test configuration;
- server, 2.6.13 + SC_MUST_COMP, ppp 2.4.4b1 + SC_MUST_COMP, pptpd 1.3.1
- client, 2.6.12.5 + SC_MUST_COMP, ppp 2.4.4b1 + SC_MUST_COMP, pptp 1.5.0
Client side pppd log fragment;
