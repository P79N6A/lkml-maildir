Oh that's quite interesting to know.

Well, in my experience, except for compiling, HT has always caused
massive slowdowns, especially on network-intensive applications.
Basically, network perf took a 20-30% hit, while compiling took
20-30% boost. But I must admit that I never tried HT on anything
more recent than a P4, maybe things have changed since.
