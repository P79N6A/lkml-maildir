User space does not expect to get dumped with -EBUSY randomly on PCI
accesses. Not a viable option in that form _but_ making them sleep would
work - even with a simple global wait queue
for the pci_unblock_.. path
ie add the following (oh and uninlined probably for compatcness)
static int pci_user_wait_access(struct pci_dev *pdev) {
	wait_event(&pci_ucfg_wait, dev->block_ucfg_access == 0);
}
