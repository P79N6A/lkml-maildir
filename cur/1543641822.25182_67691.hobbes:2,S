Hi Andre,
Here's the patch that's given me flawless performance on a PDC20269 and
the Maxtor 160GB since December -- I bought the drive when I noticed you
had a driver for it. This is E-IDE driver revision 6.31 from mid-December
2001, with 2.4.16 mainline. I and my students use the large drive largely
for digital video; it's mounted through NFS on another machine also
running 2.4.16. There's a CD drive and a DVD writer on the same machine as
the Promise card, and they work great.  I use the DVD writer for vanilla
ISO images of compressed video; there may of course be modes it doesn't
handle. For a while I had a CDRW that also worked fine.
Good news that you're working with the Promise guys. My point is don't
spread yourself too thin. Consolidate the stuff that's working, and don't
destabilize perfectly good code bending over backwards for poor hardware.  
Some girls are just too hard to please to be worth the trouble.
And hey, great work! 
Cheers,
Peter
