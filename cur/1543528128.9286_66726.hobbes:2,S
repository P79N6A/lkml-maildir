Unfortunately you've already introduced a security hole in wu.ftpd if you
dont modify it
	put //ipc/statusfile
stomp... and ipc may contain stuff you dont want outsiders reading. I'd actually
like chrooted stuff not be able to access the master /ipc. In fact being able
to mount further /ipc namespaces inside chrooted environments which are
seperate from the main one would be the good thing
Thats another step into supporting partitioning of applications on Linux
