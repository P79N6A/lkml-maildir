If you do that, RCU basically loses most of it's meaning.
You'll be taking a lock for - and dirtying in the cache - every single
dentry on the hash chain, which is pretty much guaranteed to be slower
than just taking the dcache_lock _once_, even if that one jumps across 
CPU's a lot.
In other words, no, I don't think that's a good idea. We really want to
take the dentry lock only after we're pretty sure we have the right
dentry. Otherwise the dentry chains will be bouncing from CPU to CPU all
the time.
