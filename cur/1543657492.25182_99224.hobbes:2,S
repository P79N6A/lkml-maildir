That's fairly simply done as part of the wrappers: The allocator stores the 
vaddr, paddr and size in a hash table.  Thus, the paddr can be deduced when 
kmem_cache_alloc is called by the allocation wrapper using the linearity 
property.
I've got to say though that the most sensible course of action is still to 
generalise pci_pool, which can be done easily and safely.  I think replacing 
it with a slab based scheme is probably a 2.7 thing.
