Recent Pine versions support a feature called flowed text that can 
whitespace damage your inline patches, you want to turn that off. Could 
probably also be some other setting that's causing it, but I haven't 
delved into it any deeper since my pine config seems to work well (at 
least I'm not getting any complains about damage when I use Ctrl+R to 
insert patches).
If you want it I can send you my .pinerc off-list, just ask for it in 
private email.
