OK, so back to square one: why am I supposed to do all this work for
something that will likely slow things slightly down and, at best,
doesn't hurt performance?  The old set up works great and as far as
I'm concerned, is not broken.
Don't get me wrong. I'm willing to invest time to switch to the new
setup, but I'd like to have a good reason before doing so.  That's not
asking for too much, is it?
