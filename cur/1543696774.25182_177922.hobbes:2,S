Hi Andrew,
I'm not sure who best to send this report to so feedback appreciated.
I'm running kernel 2.6-test9 here on top of Fedora Core.
XFree boots just fine but a small amount of "torturing" with mouse
movement is sufficient to lock things up solid.
This kernel is compiled for SMP (I have two Xeon's with HyperThreading).
Re-compiling the kernel for single-processor usage results in a stable
system (I'm using it to write this email).
I'm using an Intellimouse PS/2 and the Xeon's are at 2.66Ghz.
More data points:
(1) I've not encountered this problem on a dual Athlon 1.8Ghz using the
same mouse and kernel 2.6-test9 (SMP or UP).
(2) The Fedora Core Kernel 2.4 compiled for SMP also runs stably on the
dual Xeon platform (I'm booted into that kernel now as I write this email).
What would you suggest as my next steps? Would you like some more
information/other tests performed?
Many thanks,
Dan.
