Well, this sucks.
I am not sure how you both came to this impass, but it really is quite
unacceptable.  I think there are several problems here:
   No maintainer should cut off contribution from an entire
   company to a platform it intends to help support and
   implement.
   Usually these kinds of impasses are a result of limited thinking
   on the part of both parties.  You and the contributors within
   Compaq/DEC should extend an olive branch of some sort and
   try to focus on technical solutions that will work for everyone,
   including the maintainer.
It seems to me that if the conflict has been over architecture
for serial devices, you could simply agree to pursue different
paths for a while and see how that pans out.  I know of several
places in the Linus kernel where this is being done -- the
HCDs in the new USB support and the experimental VMs.
Specifically, there are two UHCI HCDs:  usb-uhci and uhci.
They were written by different people and share no code.
They should both, however, be completely compatible with
one another, since they are endeavoring to support the same
specification.  This has been blessed by Randy Dunlap for the
time being.  I believe there will come a time when one of the
UHCI HCDs will be dropped, but in the meantime, both provide
good exprimental feedback.  Perhaps you and Russell could
agree on such a path.
The bottom line is that I think you should be looking at your
contributions with a long view and think creatively about
how to avoid conflict with Russell.  On the other hand, I'm
not sure what the process is regarding the selection of
a maintainer, but it seems to me that remaining open to
contribution is a requirement for a maintainer. 
Perhaps the Linux community should draft up some
guidelines for the job of maintainer that would include
some mechanism for replacing a maintainer who is not
effectively shepherding his port.
