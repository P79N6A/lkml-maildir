With a tree, you will be allocating and de-allocating for every
insert/delete right?  That seems like a reasonable performance
hit that an array-based approach might not have... 
On cache-coherency issues, wouldn't it be more likely to have a cache hit when you are
accessing one contigious (ie the array) piece of memory?  A 4-k page
will hold a lot of indexes!!
To get around the fixed size thing..could have
the array grow itself when needed (and probably never shrink again).
This would suck if you did it often, but I'm assuming that it would
quickly grow to needed size and then stabalize...
