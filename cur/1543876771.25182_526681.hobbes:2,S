There are more uses for it.

There was a proposal some time ago to put that into the ELF aux vector
Unfortunately there was disagreement on what information to put 
there exactly (full topology, only limited numbers etc.) 
My proposal was number of CPUs, number of cores, number of nodes
as three 16 bit numbers.
