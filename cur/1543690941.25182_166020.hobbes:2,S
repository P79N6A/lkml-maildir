Hi James.
I have cleaned up the testing module.
A complete rewrite.
Code is reduced by almost 1900+ lines in tcrypt.c.
I have compiled and test it on my machine.
The kernel size is reduced by 5 Kb.
I am including the patch for testing as an attachment.
It provides uniform interface for adding new tests.
Anyway, I think, now you won't call it a dirty module.
I expect changes in the comments at the beginning of source files.
Any suggestions are welcome.
