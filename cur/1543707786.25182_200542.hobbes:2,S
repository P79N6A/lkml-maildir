Yes but...there were no high network loads. Just me typing into ssh.
STOP PRESS....FIX...
That may well be so, but I rebuilt the kernel with the optional MMIO on the 
rhine driver, and the messages have disappeared.
I have also used wget to fetch a 100Mb file at an average 1.02Mb/s and it 
worked flawlessly and still no warnings in dmesg.
