| Randy, I'd say that this :
| 
| __asm__ __volatile__("lidt %0": "=m" (var));
| 
| is better then :
| 
| __asm__ __volatile__("lidt %0": :"m" (var));
| 
| IMHO, since "var" is really an output parameter.
Yes, I agree, var is output and should be listed after the first ':'
IMHO also.
Thanks for checking that they generate the same code, though.
I'll buy you a beer...  No, wait, I already did that.  :)
