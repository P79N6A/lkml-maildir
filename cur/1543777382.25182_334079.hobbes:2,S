I'm don't think it has ever been working in the 2.6 series. If you are
getting rid of it get rid of the #define PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_VGA in pci.h
too since this code was the only user.
Looking at the code as written I don't think it would work on my
machine with multiple VGA devices on different buses. I use the system
BIOS to enable the one I want and it sets up the bridges.
This code is part of VGA arbitration which BenH is addressing with a
more globally comprehensive patch. Ben's code will probably replace
it.
