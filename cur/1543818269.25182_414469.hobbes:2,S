Is this good enough?  Isn't it possible with the current 
try_to_wake_up() implementation (with or without smpnice) for two RT 
tasks to end up on the same CPU even when there are less RT tasks than CPUs?

I wouldn't have thought a new policy was necessary.  Why not just do 
this for all SCHED_FIFO (or even all RT) tasks?
BTW Does any body in the real world actually use SCHED_RR?
