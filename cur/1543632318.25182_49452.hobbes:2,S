That is a thinko in the preempt patch, not -ac... don't bother Alan with
it.
There is a new version of the patch up at the usual place which is
fixed.  Or in smp.c just replace
	cpu = get_cpu();
with
	preempt_disable();
	cpu = smp_processor_id();
and replace
	put_cpu();
with
	preempt_enable();
Sincerely,
