Does this small patch fix the problem for you?
In another bug fix we started calling acpi_sleep_prepare on the shutdown
path called by reboot/halt/poweroff, so the code would always be called with
interrupts enabled.  This just modifies it so we only call this code
if we know we are going to power off the system.
That change was added in the patch you indicate as where the
regression started.
