A call from left field:
As a sys-admin I love the idea of the capabilities, but I hate this mount 
--bind thing. I'd really rather see it have its own command name. If it were 
strictly something that happens at mount time for a filesystem that'd be one 
thing, but
>mount --bind --capability=xx,yy /usr/bin/foo /usr/bin/foo
looks like a mistake. 
If you were loop mounting the binary into the user's directory, then I could 
see using mount.
This would be clearer:
setcap -c xx,yy /usr/bin/foo
(I also have nothing against long option names.)
