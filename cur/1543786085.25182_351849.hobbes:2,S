Yup that may be a reason to tolerate the add for realtime.

You can ask lots of application vendors the same question because its all 
over lots of user space code. The fact is that gettimeofday() / 
clock_gettime() efficiency is very critical to the performance of many 
applications on Linux. That is why the addtion of one add instruction may 
better be carefully considered. Many platforms can execute gettimeofday 
without having to enter the kernel.
