Hi all!
Just a quick thingy, it might be worth entering this into some FAQ:
When using a Gigabyte BXD [SMP] motherboard, make sure your bios setup is
configured to use MPS version 1.1, and not 1.4 !!!
This little change caused my USB driver to start working fast again (my
printer was suffering from a data underflow), and my soundcard, based on an
es1370, stopped generating quazillions of interrupts per second..
What is disturbing: this isn't discussed anywhere near the kernel-source,
I'd have expected some witty comments on this, but well, it seems to work
again -- or is someone busy implementing the MPS 1.4 specs into the kernel?
Regards,
--
