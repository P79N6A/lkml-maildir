I'd like to second that I think private-namespaces are the right way
to solve this sort of problem.  It also helps not cluttering the
global namespace with user-local mounts

I'd like to talk about this a bit more and start driving to a solution
here.  I've been looking at the namespace code quite a bit and was
just about to dive in and start checking into adding/fixing certain
aspects such as stackable namespaces, optional inheritence (changes in
a parent namespace are reflected in the child but not vice-versa),
etc.
One aspect I was thinking about here was a mount flag that would give
you a new private namespace (if you didn't already have one) for the
mount (and I guess that would impact any subsequent mounts from the
user in that shell).  Another option would be a 'newns' style
system-call, but I'm generally against adding new system calls.
Shared subtrees are a tricky one.  I know how we would handle it in
V9FS, but not sure how well that would translate to others
(essentially we'd re-export the subtree so other user's could mount it
individually -- but that's a very Plan 9 solution and may not be what
more UNIX-minded folks would want -- we also need to improve our own
server infrastructure to more efficiently support such a re-export).
So, to sum up I think private namespaces is the right solution, and
I'd rather put effort into making it more useful than work-around the
fact that its not practical right now.
