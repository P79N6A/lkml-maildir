besides cycle overhead, function tracing increases cache footprint - and 
with a CPU that has smaller caches (such as the C3) it can tip a loop 
over the edge, and can make it cache-trashing, while it would fit into 
the cache before. In such a situation the difference can be dramatic.
(on CPUs with larger caches similar artifacts can happen too, but it 
needs a 'fatter' loop, which are apparently rarer.)
