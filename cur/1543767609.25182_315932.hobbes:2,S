As others have mentioned, bzImage seems to be a requirement now for x86.  
However, zImage will not do any better for you.  I recall doing testing of 
zImage vs bzImage a long time back, and the bzImage kernels were slightly 
smaller than the zImage ones anyway.  I think you're going to be out of luck 
trying to get your kernel that small.  A single floppy boot/root disk isn't 
really possible with 2.6 kernels anymore.  Have you looked into pxe booting 
instead?  I work at a cluster company and we do tons of pxe/network booting 
stuff.
