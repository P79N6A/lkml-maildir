You're duplicating the VFS infrastructure with your pluging system.

Hans, this only shows you didn't listen to be the last few times I
explained it to you.  There's nothing wrong with defining plug in IDs
associated with every file, and the linux file_operations, inode_operations,
etc.. are _not_ filesystem granularity but inode granularity (except in
reiser4 where you throw everything together just to add your own
de-multiplexer below).  So the only thing your plugin might need to is to
define it's own file or inode operations (in fact it might need a few
more things speaking from experience with kinda similar things, but it
certainly doesn't need to duplicate what's there)

There's nothing wrong with that, although such things might be better
as a stackable filesystem.  Maybe they're not, and we'll find out once
people are prototyping these things and playing with them. But you don't
need your additional layer of abstraction for those anyway

Because root can read kernel memory this is completely useless :)
But if you want it as your private patch no one forbits you to do it,
just don't expect such security by obscurity to go into mainline.

most of your audience doesn't understand the fine points of filesystem
implementation.  they want your feature but don't care how it's implemented.
here it's the other way around - we don't care too much about what not so
important features we have but more about how sanely they're implemented.

Now we're getting personal again, right?  My filesystems according to
MAINTAINERS are freevxfs and sysfs, but if you look at commit logs I've
done work on pretty much any filesystem in the tree, and often doing tree-wide
changes.  That's why I care about every new filesystem in the tree and not
a single one.
