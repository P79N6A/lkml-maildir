grep for CONFIG_PCI_DOMAINS in arch code and include/linux/pci.h.
This is normal "arch" interface:  you enable a define, and a group of 
functions is assumed to be present.  Otherwise (!defined), a set of stub 
no-ops is activated for your arch.
I have implemented the [small] group of functions the code assumes to be 
present, when CONFIG_PCI_DOMAINS is enabled, like all the other arches 
that implement PCI domain support.
