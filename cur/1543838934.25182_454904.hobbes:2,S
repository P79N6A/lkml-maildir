I guess there is a difference as to what you call controlling. You
probably mean that in Windows is is easier to navigate GUI with
keyboard whereas I mean that in Linux or Unix you just start a
terminal program and do all necessary setup from within it (with
keyboard ;) )

Well, it was just a thing to try. On some boxes interrupt mode of EC
was reported to hurt mice, while on others there was no effect or even
was an improvement.

Hmm, don't see anything bad happening here.. Could you please send me
your /var/log/messages (still after booting with i8042.debug=1
log_buf_len=131072)? You should probably spare other people's
mailboxes and send it to me directly... Or put it on FTP somewhere.
Thanks!
