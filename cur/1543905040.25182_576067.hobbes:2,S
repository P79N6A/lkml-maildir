Can you send me a dmesg, there are some cases when high disk load can
cause high interrupt latency in both 2.2 and 2.6 depending upon what is
configured. I don't think thats related to the main problem but it is
worth knowing about hdparm -u1

It means more load but that shouldn't matter much, and the transmit side
if under load with asynchronous traffic will not lose bytes sending.
