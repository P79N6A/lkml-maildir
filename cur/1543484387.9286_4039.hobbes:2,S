I noticed this with 2.2.1 - at one stage I through the machine had locked
solid, but it was just my MRTG cron job running.. mouse under X stopped
for about 5 or more seconds.. keyboard didnt respond..
it happened again an then every other time it became sluggish..
seems to be a I/O/swap related thing.. I didn notice those kinda things
before 2.2.0..
I maybe imagining it.. but it just seemed odd..
