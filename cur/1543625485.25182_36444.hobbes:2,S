Whoops, my apologies.  The patch looks ok to me.
I read your text closely and the patch not close enough.  As I said, it 
is indeed wrong for a device driver to fail f_op->release(), "fail" 
being defined as leaving fd state lying around, assuming that the system 
will fail the fput().
But your patch merely propagates a return value, not change behavior, 
which seems sane to me.
