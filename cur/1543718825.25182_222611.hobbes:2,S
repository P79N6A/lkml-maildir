I had been hoping someone had just forged your email

The wordy mix-case aspect is kind of annoying, and for

I count:
1. came up with the design ideas
2. wrote the original patch
3. reviewed and passed on
4. modified
5. blindly passed on

Add "pirated:" if you like, so that searching for
pirated code is easier than checking the evil bit.
