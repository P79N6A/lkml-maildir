Calling that for whatever is passed, certainly.
But the <linux/spi.h> header does have a comment right next to the
declarations of spi_transfer.tx_buf and rx_buf, saying that "buffers
must work with dma_*map_single() calls.
In general all APIs that use DMA will follow the rules listed under
"What memory is DMA'able?" in:
  linux/Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt
The rest of that file is a bit PCI-centric, but that section remains
the primary description of what can be DMA'd.  I had assumed that went
without saying; permaps wrongly.
