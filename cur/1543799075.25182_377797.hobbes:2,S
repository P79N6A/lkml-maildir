Sure, and we're now more costly than the current implementation with irq 
disabling.
If we go with simple mutexes that's because there is a gain, even a huge 
one on ARM, especially for the fast uncontended case.  If you guys 
insist on making things so generic and rigid then there is no gain 
anymore worth the bother.
