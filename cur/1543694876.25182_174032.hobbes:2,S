After having read numerous arcticles regarding oom
killer/conditions/bugs/features I believe the lack of the oom killer is
possibly the best scenario _without_ any user configuration. If you really want
an oom killer it seems obvious that what you really want is a _configurable_
oom killer. The simple approach in configuration is handing it a list of
processes it should _not_ kill. This means of course you need a user-space tool
to mark processes as not oom-killable, possibly implemented as a kind of
priority. Not set means "kill-at-will", set means top-priority gets killed as
last.
Did we already have this kind of proposal? :-)
