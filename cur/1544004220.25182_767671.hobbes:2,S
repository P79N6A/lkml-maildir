What do you think about elevator based solutions like 2 level cfq
patches submitted by Satoshi and Vasily earlier? CFQ can be trivially
modified to do proportional division (i.e give time slices in
proportion to weight instead of priority). And such a solution would
avoid idleness problem like the one you mentioned above and can also
avoid burstiness issues (see smoothing patches -- v1.2.0 and v1.3.0 --
of dm-ioband) in token based schemes.
Also doing time based token allocation (as you mentioned in TODO list)
sounds very interesting. Can we look at the disk time taken by each
bio and use that to account for tokens? The problem is that the time
taken is not available when the requests are sent to disk, but we can
do delayed token charging (i.e deduct tokens after the request is
completed?). It seems that such an approach should work. What do you
think?
