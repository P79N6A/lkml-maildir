   Would you tell us the points of the "several details," please?
We believe that the whole SPD/SAD mechanism should move
eventually to a top-level flow cache shared by ipv4 and
ipv6.
Therefore all the interfaces will be architected such that
a move to a flow cache based lookup system will be a very
simple change.
