It would seem that the OEMs buying the board would like this feature, 
since it could be incorporated into POST, diagnostic CDs, etc. And since 
server owners are more likely to have a service contract, anything to 
make service calls faster is a benefit to the system vendor.

If someone handed them some good specs except for the table, I suspect 
they would see the benefit. Independent BIOS writers compete for board 
contracts, in-house writers want features with one time cost and every 
time benefit, I think you're right that this would be a benefit to everyone.
Given that it seems so simple, is there a reason why this hasn't been 
around for ages?
