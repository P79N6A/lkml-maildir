Get a better DAC960 :). The DAC960 I'm currently using is triple channel,
and also most DAC960's handle 15 drivesd per channel. If VA don't know of
any DAC960's with more than one channel - I'd drop them as your source for
advice.
Also make sure that the drives you've purchased/purchasing are compatible
with the DAC960. DAC960's are very picky in their drive friends they make
(even revision numbers can make a difference).
Try the mylex website, or even read the /linux/Documentation/README.DAC960
Cheers,
Peter.
