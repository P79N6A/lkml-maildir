I don't really want to see V34 in the kernel if at all possible. V34 isnt that
real time. This is a test for the kernel I think. mlock() and using the
real time scheduling should be enough. If not then Ingo and others have a 
target to polish up the scheduling patch.
The other thing about V34 in user space is you ought to be able to use it with
any sound card ;)
