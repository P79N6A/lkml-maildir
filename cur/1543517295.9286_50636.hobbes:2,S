The only way way to go, unless there is a local driver to interpret
the IOCTL, collect the needed data, then transfer it (only once..) and then
transfer the return value back.

or even
	ioctl(fd, ptr,...)
No difference. other than the inability to distinquish from the data transfer
read/write...
IOCTLs (no matter what you call them) are there for out-of-band data. What
the control data is happens to be is up to the filesystem/driver. Some of them
have standardized interfaces, many more do not. As far as security goes,
they still have to be optionally audited. Control over what is transferred
doesn't have to be enforced - the open of the fd covers that.
The only time I can think of that would require more is when removable media
has a mandatory lable - Users shouldn't be able to overwrite the label. I
do think that this can be handled in a relatively simple way (of course I
don't happen to have one handy...).
