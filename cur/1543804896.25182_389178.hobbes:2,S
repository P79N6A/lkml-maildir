Actually fs/ramfs/file-nommu.c does use this (but it need not because
!CONFIG_MMU page allocator already does something similar).
But largely, no in-tree drivers use the facility so I think it would
be good for the mm folk to consider the first use case if and when it
comes up. So I've added a comment in split_page to that effect.
