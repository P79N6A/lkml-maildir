I rewrote the reschedule_idle heuristics because the old 2.2.x heuristics
was buggy and made no sense to me.
The 2.2.x version of my reschedule_idle rewrote is here (against 2.2.12
but will apply cleanly against 2.2.13):

It's production quality so don't worry to apply it on your most critical
server. It's just been included into 2.3.x and infact people noticed it
while starting X 8).
Please Arthur try it and feedback producing some performance number.
Thanks.
