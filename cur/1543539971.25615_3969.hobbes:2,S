This is just an interim bug fix for the create.c file permissions
problem reported yesterday.  There's a new set of archives (nwfs0726.zip
and nwfs0726) posted at 207.109.151.240 and www.timpanogas.com that
contain this fix.  This problem corrects the permission create errors
seen with tar and zip.
:-)
