Thanks for the good detective work. I'd appreciate if you could find
the text
#define NTFS_GETS8(p)        ((*(ntfs_u8*)(p)))
in ntfsendian.h and replace it with
#define NTFS_GETS8(p)        ((*(ntfs_s8*)(p)))
Please report if this works, so I can provide Linus with an additional
patch. Well, this is is what we get if we accept other people's
patches without looking at them line-by-line. I start hating myself
for rushing this release.
Regards,
Martin
(*) Now that I have to offer an additional patch, anyway, I think it
I'll replace the (experimental) with (DANGEROUS)
