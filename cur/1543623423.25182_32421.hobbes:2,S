   The reason I ask this is because I have been trying to setup a
   tunnel, and I cant get it to work either with ifconfig or iproute.
   [root@towel ip]# ip tunnel add blink mode sit remote x.x.x.x dev
   eth0
   ioctl: Invalid argument
The reason this fails is because SIOCADDTUNNEL uses SIOCDEVPRIVATE
which can't be translated properly to/from 32-bit apps running
on 64-bit kernels.
