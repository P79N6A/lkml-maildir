uhm, but why? "Probably safer" is not the right kind of technical 
argument ;-)
The PCI-GART quirk which we use on some systems unmaps pages _not_ 
because of coherency problems (any cache coherency problems would be 
triggerable before we unmap them anyway), but due to _page aliasing_ 
problems: these pages might be in our general e820 map so we must 
disable them.
( in any case, the CPA code does not deal with cache attribute coherency 
  - that is topic of the upcoming PAT feature. We still largely rely on 
  MTRRs to get cache coherency right. )
furthermore, your patch does not even do what you claim it does, because
it is an elaborate NOP on most modern CPUs:

as clflush does not work on not present pages...
