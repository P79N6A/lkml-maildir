It appears I could do this with the generic netlink subsystem.
I'll have a go at it.

And, will still be in the netlink implementation and will still return
an appropriate error.

Agian, will still be in the netlink implementation.
Speak up if it's not right.

OK, I'll do that if someone speaks up.

Also, still in the netlink implementation, with a comment a bit more
informative than the one above.

That's not going to change.
There's nothing new here at all.
This is merely an re-implementation of the existing autofs ioctl
interface with two additional calls, nothing more.

I'll add a document describing this, as previously agreed.

I haven't had any problems with this over time.
I've always thought that this was because the flag is only set during an
expire, of which there is only ever one going for a given mount, is
synchronous, and mount requests only read the flag to check status.
But I could be wrong since it may have been OK because the existing
autofs ioctl holds the BKL for its operations.
I'll think about it.
