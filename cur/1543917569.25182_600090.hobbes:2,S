Hi!
I have just compiled a 2.6.23-rc8 using the config from my 2.6.22 as a basis
and I came out with a not working (almost black) vga text console.
This is what I'm getting on my logs:
Console: colour dummy device 80x25
console [tty0] enabled
Instead of the old:
Console: colour VGA+ 80x25
The options related to the console on my config are these:
CONFIG_VT=y
CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_HW_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_CORE=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT=y
CONFIG_DUMMY_CONSOLE=y
The machine is a AMD x64 X2 Athlon with a NForce 4 chipset, vga is a ATI
radeon and I have also set:
CONFIG_DRM=m
CONFIG_DRM_RADEON=m
I have tried with and without CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT and
CONFIG_VIDEO_OUTPUT_CONTROL with the same results. BTW: when X starts the
display is Ok.
If you want me to do any tests or need more info just tell me.
Regards...
