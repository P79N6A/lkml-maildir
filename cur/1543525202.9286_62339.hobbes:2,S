RAID is not in working state in 2.3. It's in Cox's ToDo list. Ingo planned
to port it's RAID 0.90 to 2.3 for 2.4 ... AFAIK it was not done.

Since RAID is broken and it's KNOWN that RAID is broken there are no way to
try to compile it...

Features known to be broken should not be compiled. They should be fixed
instead. And there are not enough manpower to fix all such places :-/
