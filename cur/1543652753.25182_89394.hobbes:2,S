How about the following:
clean	Delete all intermidiate files, including symlinks and modversions
mrproper	clean + deletes .config and .config.old
distclean	mrproper + all editor backup, patch backup files
In other words a more powerfull clean compared to today.
The difference between clean and mrproper is then _only_ the configuration
files. That easy to explain, and thats easy to understand. Today only
very few people know the difference, and simply save their config,
and do make mrproper.
I have many times seen people do something like:
cp .config xxx
make mrproper
mv xxx .config
No need for that, when make clean deletes enough.
Only caveat is that people are forced to wait for the modversion stuff,
but to my understanding Rusty is making that step obsolete soon.
Did I miss something obvious?
