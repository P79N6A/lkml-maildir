Well, I've never gotten a single SCSI error from the controller...  not to
mention that the block being requested is WAY beyond the end of the
device.  If this wasn't a RAID device, this would be one of the 'Attempt
to access beyond end of device' errors that non-raid users have reported
many times for the 2.2 series kernels.
I have also gotten the error when not under any load, about once a month
or so, but never with the alarming frequency of last night!
