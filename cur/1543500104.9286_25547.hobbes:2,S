With a server running 2.3.8-pre2, my diskless workstation (2.2.9) boots
the kernel, successfully mounts /, there is disk activity as it starts
rc.sysinit, but then it stops and gives "server not responding" and
"can't get a request slot" messages.  It never recovers.  set -v in
rc.sysinit indicates that it does not get far, and stops on the line:
ifup ifcfg-lo 
This is all RedHat 6.0.  I am using knfsd.  There are no error messages
printed in /var/log/messages or debug.log except that the various
daemons started successfully.  If I try to bring down NFS services, the
attempt just hangs.
If I boot the same server with 2.2.9, everything works fine.
