The process would work a lot faster if the Fedora project would
contribute anything at all to ALSA development.  It's a lot of work!  I
haven't seen a line of sound driver code from anyone at Red Hat since
the OSS->ALSA transition, years ago.  Meanwhile the vendors keep getting
cheaper and cheaper, which means more functionality that used to be in
hardware has to be done in the drivers.
For example the Debian people are very helpful, they have someone who
filters out the real bug reports from their users and pushes them into
the ALSA bug tracker.  Fedora just points clueless users at the ALSA bug
tracker and tells them "good luck".
