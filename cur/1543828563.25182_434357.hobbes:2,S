Please send me a copy asap - I urgently need to get the -mm patches vaguely
stabilised.
I'm somewhat surprised that the sn2 failed so seriously - I thought Jes was
testing that fairly regularly.
I think we kinda-sorta have a handle on the s2io->IRQ problem (although the
unexpectedly-held console spinlock is a mystery).
The scsi->BIO->mempool->slab crash is also a mystery.
Thanks.
