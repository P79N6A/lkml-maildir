first the nvidia thing needs to be removed from that kernel. (wouldnt be 
the first time it messes up the preempt count)
i have the PREEMPT_TRACE feature in the latency-tracer patch-queue. I've 
merged it to 2.6.18-mm1 and have uploaded a combo patch to:
 
http://redhat.com/~mingo/latency-tracing-patches/latency-tracing-2.6.18-mm1.patch
CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT should be enabled, that will activate 
CONFIG_PREEMPT_TRACE. No need to enable latency tracing itself.
