Hi,
i''ve got an external USB 2.0 HDD. First 120GB Partition is AES encrypted 
reiser4. I just got LOADS of errors. syslogd is still writing them to disk. 
I have no idea whats happening here.
reiser4 paniced, usb told me "ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: devpath 4 ep2out 
3strikes" and SCSI emulation had ioerrors.unmounting the reiser4 isn't 
possible, umount segfaults. Whatever happens here, we need - at least - lower 
the amount of log generatet. This is not really handy...
lsusb still lists the disk
syslog can be found (as soon as syslogd finished...;) at
http://zodiac.dnsalias.org/misc/crashlog
I have used swsp and suspend to ram some times before, if that matters.
Please tell me if you need additional log. 
regards
Alex
