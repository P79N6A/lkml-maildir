I think that's broken (because I don't see where that behavior is
described). IMO, based on the code, it should only go with defaults when
-n -y or -m is passed. Anything else should detect when stdin is not
valid and abort. If stdin is valid, and empty string is read, then
that's a valid "give me the default" response.
Why is it so hard to error when stdin is closed? It's not like that will
break anything.
Since silentoldconfig does this, then oldconfig should aswell. The only
naming difference is that silentoldconfig is quiet, and oldconfig is
not. Why should the two act any differently with a closed stdin?
