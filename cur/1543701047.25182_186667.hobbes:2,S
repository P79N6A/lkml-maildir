Accusys is a stolen technology from Dupli-Disk, there are law suits
pending the last time I heard.
If it was based on the original firmware of the Dupli-Disk, it has totally
wrong state machines for executing hdparm style callers.
I know the FSM's are wrong because I fixed them for Dupli-Disk.
How they operate, I can not disclose.  But Accusys can not handle correct
settings for FSM to Taskfile.
