I know that my Compaq X1000-series laptop does do some kind of ACPI 
games with the disk on ACPI power off (I assume it is putting the disk 
in standby before power-off at least). It also does this if you boot 
into DOS, GRUB, etc. and then hit the power button. Could be if the disk 
is dumb enough to spin up for sync cache and standby when there is 
nothing to flush, and the kernel does its own standby, this could cause 
an extra spinup/down..
