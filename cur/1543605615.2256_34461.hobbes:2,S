I decided against adding special code to sysctl for the taint flag so
yes, you can clear it.  There is no point in adding special code for
the taint sysctl, it is even easier to remove the taint message from
the log before submitting.
As AC has said (several times) tainting is not foolproof, it is to help
triage bug reports from people who don't submit complete information.
Those users who know enough to lie are also unlikely to submit bug
reports.  Tainting is to help beginners.
