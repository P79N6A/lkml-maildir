What I originally did did so for a good reason, which was that it was
intended to support far more radical reorganizations, for instance,
things that changed the per-cpu runqueue affairs for gang scheduling.
I wrote a top-level driver that did support scheduling classes in a
similar fashion, though it didn't survive others maintaining the patches.
