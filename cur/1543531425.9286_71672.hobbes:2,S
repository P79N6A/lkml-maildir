2.3.99-pre2-2 with pppd-2.3.10 failed to work for me as well (see
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=95328556110781&w=2
for details).
After upgrading to pppd-2.3.11 (the RPM from the RedHat-6.2 BETA)
it worked like a charm with 2.3.99-pre3-3.
Oh, and this is async PPP over X.75 on an EURO-ISDN base
connection.
