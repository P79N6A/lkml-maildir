It shouldn't be necessary to do this - the CPU will do the right thing with PCI
bus cycles on its own.  I simply have 
if [ -n "`/sbin/lspci -d 10de:0020`" ]; then
        echo 'base=0xe6000000 size=0x1000000 type=write-combining' >/proc/mtrr
fi
in my /etc/rc.local, and its been working well for months.  By "ignore
the memory at 0xe4000000", I mean exactly that - just don't put any mtrr
entry for it.
I think the Riva TNT cards *do* have a full 16MB of video memory.
Only some of it may be frame store, depending on the resolution etc, but
the rest is used for off-screen pixmaps.  If VESA reports only 15MB of
video memory, it probably only means framebuffer and ignores the other
things you can do with the memory.  The X server can make us of it all
(off-screen pixmaps, windows, font cache, etc).

The stuff at 0xe4000000 is not RAM, its probably just memory-mapped control
registers.  A card can take up 32MB of address space but only have 16MB of RAM.

It's probably all video memory, but the X server maps it in chunks depending on
what its using each chunk for.  That will depend on your video modes and what
ever else you've been using the X server for.
X -probeonly will tell you where and how much video memory the X server found,
and you should just use that for your MTRR setting.  I hope the X server will
set its own MTRR soon and avoid all this confusion.
