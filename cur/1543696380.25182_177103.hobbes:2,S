I agree...there's much more in lib than just percpu_counter_mod.

Actually, I do think lib serves a purpose for shared routines that are
used in disparate places throughout the kernel.
Why code these as Kconfig symbol dependencies when the library mechanism
does exactly what we want except for this one all symbols are in modules
case.  As a counter example: kobject is in lib...Imagine exactly how
many Kconfig conditions we'd have to introduce to conditionalise that...
I really think the correct way forwards is to fix the one failing case;
I was just asking if anyone had already thought about it.
