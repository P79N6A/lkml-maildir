The only requirement here is that the checksum be correct.  And sure,
that's not a hard guarantee because, on average, you will get a good
checksum for bad data once every 4 billion power events that mess up
the final superblock transfer.  Let me see, if that happens once a year,
your data should still be good when the warrantee on the sun expires.

Since the updated tree is created non-destructively with respect to
the original tree, the only priority relationship that matters is the
requirement that all blocks of the updated tree be securely committed
before the new superblock is written.

Surely it can't be that *all* IDE disks can fail in that way?  And it
seems the jury is still out on SCSI, I'm interested to see where that
discussion goes.
