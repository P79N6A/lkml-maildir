Not really. We have removed the nfs_client from the public lists, and we
are guaranteed that there are no more active superblocks attached to it
so nothing can call the reclaimer routine (which is the only routine
that takes a write lock on clp->cl_sem).

Yes, I believe that we can, for the same reasons as above: the race with
the reclaimer is impossible, hence the read lock on cl_sem is redundant.

No, that should not be possible. Again, see above: there are no active
superblocks, so clp->cl_superblocks is empty.
