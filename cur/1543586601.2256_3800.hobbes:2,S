These are excerpts from ppp 2.4.1 README.linux file:
...
The Linux PPP implementation includes both kernel and user-level
parts.  This package contains the user-level part, which consists of
the PPP daemon (pppd) and associated utilities.  In the past this
package has contained updated kernel drivers.  This is no longer
necessary, as the current 2.2 and 2.4 kernel sources contain
up-to-date drivers.               
...
2.1 Kernel driver
Assuming you are running a recent 2.2 or 2.4 (or later) series kernel,
the kernel source code will contain an up-to-date kernel PPP driver.
If the PPP driver was included in your kernel configuration when your
kernel was built, then you only need to install the user-level
programs.  Otherwise you will need to get the source tree for your
kernel version, configure it with PPP included, and recompile.  Most
Linux distribution vendors ship kernels with PPP included in the
configuration.                       
...
Hope this helps,
