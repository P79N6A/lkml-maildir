Hello,
I am trying to allocate memory from a driver using GFP_KERNEL.
The allocation fails if I try to allocate more than what is physically free.
What ever memory is free is available in the free buffers/cache.
Why is this happening ? How do I allocate more memory than what is 
available in the 'free physical'.
Shouldn't kmalloc take care of flushing free buffers/cache to free 
physical when there is a memory allocation requirement ?
I am running 2.4.7-10 RH7.2 on i386.
Any suggestions or pointers could be very helpful.
Thank you.
Regards,
Sriram
