I agree. Trying to do an FSCK on such a beast must be REALLY fun.
The old UNISYS had similar things to track file revisions. Half the
time the file got really screwed when there was a crash - the same
line of fortran would be repeated (once for every change made to it).
It also made the filesystem very slow.
The only support I can think of would be a flag on a "directory" to
indicate to an underlying file system that the file is complex. That
way when a unix tar, cpio, dump ... (they have to carry the bit) copies
files out, the mkdir would recieve the flag. The underlying FS could
impliment it as either a simple directory (plus flag), or a complex file
with native streams. Tar and cpio copying from a filesystem with the
native streams would see a directory with the bit.
No changes to open or anything but the directory functions to pass
the flag back and forth.
