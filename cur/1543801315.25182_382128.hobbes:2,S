>Why don't you go and look instead of quibbling in the abstract?
I'm in favor of asking for clarification on the mailing list instead of 
going and looking.  It's more efficient for one person to do the research 
and then disseminate the information on a mailing list instead of everyone 
going and looking.
>Why are you bothering to nitpick Harald?
I'm in favor of the nitpick.  Little ambiguities and errors can cause big 
misunderstandings that snowball; I have more trouble with people who fail 
to recognize they've inferred something that wasn't said than with people 
who refuse to infer.
>Do you not realise he understands the GPL better than you do
As a scientist, I give no one a free ride with, "It's true because I said 
it and I should know."  Being an expert only means you're better able to 
prove you're right.
