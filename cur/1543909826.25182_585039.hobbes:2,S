This may have been the intend. However, today the visibility is controlled 
using barriers. And we have barriers that we use with atomic operations. 
Having volatile be the default just lead to confusion. Atomic read should 
just read with no extras. Extras can be added by using variants like 
atomic_read_volatile or so.
