yep, i guess it's the two missed-preemption points i fixed in -16.

are you sure you got the order of the columns right? :-|
e.g. the lt004.18PK traces you sent show a number of huge latencies,
biggest one being 1949µs. The biggest one in lt001.18RT is 250 usecs,
and much of that i believe is due to debugging overhead. (It's not
apples to apples because i dont have the RT-under-stress traces yet.) 
something's really not kosher here.

this too is suspicious to me. How can then the PREEMPT_RT kernel end up
performing within 100 usecs in only 78.56% of the measurements - it's
ridiculously low! The tracer might have a bug, but such a selective bug?
the only recent thing added was the global RT balancer, which is not
active under PREEMPT_DESKTOP. Maybe this code somehow interferes with
your workload? Could you try to disable it, by changing kernel/sched.c's
#ifdefs from:
 #if defined(CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT) && defined(CONFIG_SMP)
to:
 #if 0
(there are ~5 such places in sched.c)
