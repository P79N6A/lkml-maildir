In this section I've used the trick:
#if (LINUX_VERSION_CODE > 0x20100)
#define driver_name name
#endif
out of the main code path. (I.e. near the top). That assigns the
"name" variable twice, but as long as you do it before the actual
assignment, it gets the ugly define out of the main path again. 
This is getting a bit ugly, so you might decide to find the cure
worse than the problem.
