Assuming you have outgoing traffic on the NIC as well it isn't that bad,
because there will be likely some queueing delay for the ACK in which
you could in theory still cancel it of you know better (it would hurt the
abstraction between device drivers and dev.c a lot though)

That would just break the whole idea behind softnet. When you're juggling
the cache line for the sequence counter you could as well juggle the 
cache line with a shared queue head, e.g. we would be at 2.2 level again.

That's the real solution long term, right.
