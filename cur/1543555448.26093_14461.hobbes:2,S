It seems like lastest kernels cannot run lmbench successfully.
lmbench stops at "Local networking", between lat_connect
and bw_tcp, as far as I can see from 'top'.
No errors reported, lat_connect or bw_tcp exit silently.
All 2.4.0-test[5-11] seem to have this problem.
2.4.0-test1 and 2.2.x all run lmbench successfully instead.
