I couldn't agree more.
But I do think there is value there because DIPC and friends could be very
valuable as tools for developing applications that work better in a
distributed manner.  If each section of code (thread, process) can operate
within the framework that DIPC, et al. provide then there is a good argument
for providing that functionality as an integrated part of the OS where things
like filesystems and process management and signalling can be coordinated with
the help of the kernel.
