That's something we need to do anyway, but here it's not a matter of removal
blocking on module refcount:

and that is clearly broken.  Moreover, unlike having rmmod -w interruptible
(which is obviously a very good idea), here we would be in the middle of
cleanup sequence and it would be too late to back off if interrupted.
