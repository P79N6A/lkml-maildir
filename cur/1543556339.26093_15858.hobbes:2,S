Not really. Anything that modifies directories holds both ->i_sem and
->i_zombie, lookups hold ->i_sem and emptiness checks (i.e. victim in
rmdir and overwriting rename) hold ->i_zombie, readdir holds both.
So we could even play with punching holes in them - very easy to do when
you do ext2_delete_entry(). I've done that on directories-in-pagecache
system, but decided that I don't want to deal with (bogus) warnings from
earlier kernels (they would do the right thing, but they would complain
loudly). Truncating is a piece of cake. Repacking is not a good idea,
though, since you are risking massive corruption in case of dirty shutdown
in the wrong moment.
