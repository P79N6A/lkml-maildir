At the start of my discussion with Larry, I asked if the firmware
could cause such a difference. Larry said no, and I believed him, but
I'm very lost as to what could be causing such a difference between
bcm43xx and b43. I figured it was at least worth testing, I mean, it
wasn't like I was recommending others do the same.
I'm actually still using the b43legacy driver right now, and it really
does work exactly the same as b43. If you're interested, here's the
relevant section of dmesg from when I loaded the b43legacy driver:
