Hey Matt,
Sorry for pulling back out of your vacation to resolve the issue where one
never existed.  You have to understand this is all about gemme gemme free
and do not want anyone or anything to get in people's way.  Even to the
point of added excessive meaning to a simple copyright license.
From what I see and had expected, DELL has/had met its obligations to GPL.
I hope everyone including "FLUKE" is happy about interrupting somebodies
vacation, and me have to burn personal capital to get a response from Matt
on this issue.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
