As far as I'm aware, the known MMCONFIG-related issues that I'm aware of 
are or have been:
-Some devices built into the AMD K8 integrated northbridge can't be 
reached by MMCONFIG - already handled
-Overlap of device BAR and MMCONFIG aperature during BAR sizing causing 
lockup - can be avoided by disabling device decode during BAR sizing.
-PCI Express CRS-related issues - already handled by disabling CRS by 
default
-Devices behind certain host bridges (some AMD HT to PCI-X bridges, 
others?) can't be reached by MMCONFIG - can be handled by Tony Camuso's 
patch or something similar (note that this is really a BIOS bug, it 
should not list those buses in the MCFG table if MMCONFIG cannot access 
them, and if it didn't I think we could already handle that)
-Some issue with some AMD CPUs needing MMCONFIG accesses to use a 
certain register I believe? already handled?
Of these, I think the PCI BAR/MMCONFIG overlap problem is responsible 
for by far the most cases of machines thought to have "broken MMCONFIG", 
when in fact they were nothing of the sort. I don't recall hearing of a 
single machine where MMCONFIG really just didn't work at all.
As I've mentioned before, all of these issues (well, I suppose not the 
BAR overlap one) need to be resolved whether we have Arjan's patch or 
not, otherwise if a driver does opt in and tries to use extended config 
space it will still break. And if they are resolved, the patch seems 
quite pointless.
