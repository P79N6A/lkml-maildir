Here's an example; if there's a theoretical integer under/overflow in
some part of the kernel, but no one is hitting it because (by chance,
not by design) there's no way for a user to stuff an incorrect value in
there.
Does it get fixed in 2.6.x.y?  According to the above rule, it does not.
However, it may be the case where a third party patch end up modifying
things such that the value in the sign integer is now not properly
sanity checked (ignore any security issues for the moment; assume only
root can stuff an incorrect value in there).  If it's a core function, a
third party module may end up calling it without checking the integer
value it's passing.  So, it's not a problem in 2.6.x; it becomes a
problem at some later point, thanks to an external patch or module.
Why not just fix it?  It still falls under the category of an obvious
fix; just because a user isn't triggering it now, doesn't mean they
won't be triggering it later.  An argument could be made that this would
mean a lot of extra work for the Suckers, but it's only up to the point
at which the next 2.6.x kernel is released.

I'm not saying fix every problem, but I would think that those that fix
a (potential) race, oops, hang, or security issue would be worth fixing.
But then, maybe I'm reading too much into this (as it's been stated
these are guidelines, not rules..)

Ah, yes.
