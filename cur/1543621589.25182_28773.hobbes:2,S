This is happening on boxes with 1 GB of memory, etc... Besides that,
bdflush's first argument is a percentage, and that's what I was
adjusting.  And yes, I've set the percentage way down and it has
increased the rate at which it switches back and forth to make it look
like it's reading and writing at the same time, but it's not.  Throughput
never goes up.
This sort of thing works fine in 2.2 kernels...
