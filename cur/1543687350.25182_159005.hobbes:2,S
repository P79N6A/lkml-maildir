yes it is coustomised board and ISP1161A host controller is connected to a 
fpga device which is on the PCI bus. Infact it is one of the general purpose 
io (gpio-23) to which usb interrupt line is connected and gpio is programmed 
as an interrupt. I am getting the 'sof' interrupt continuously (at every 
1msec) and I can see the corresponding interrupt count in /proc/interrupts 
is incrementing accordingly.
Regarding hc 1161a, I have been told by phillips factory people that the 
driver is working fine with the x86 platform. I did a port to the powerpc 
platform.
