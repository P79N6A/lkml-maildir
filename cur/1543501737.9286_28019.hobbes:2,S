Hello Linus,
   I'd like to drop the static array from kernel/resource.c (the number of
regions in systems with lots of PCI boards can grow pretty high) and replace it
by dynamic allocation of resource buckets. However, request_region() can be
called before the MM gets initialized (for example in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c
or in console init). I'd like to know your opinion on what path should we
choose:
   - "head in the sand" strategy -- just ignore the problem and if it bites
     us, increase the array size.
   - Try moving all resource mgmt calls after MM init.
   - Create a trivial memory allocator (free-less) for allocations before
     MM gets inited. This would also save passing of memory_start to many
     functions and make parsing of command-line options easier (for now the
     drivers need to have their own static arrays for options).
   - Use few static resource buckets before MM gets inited and allocate
     the rest dynamically.
				Have a nice fortnight
