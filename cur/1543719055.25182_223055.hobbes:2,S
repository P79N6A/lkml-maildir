Correct, we don't have to worry about that.  The various chips either
(a) lock the bus during the entire tablewalk, or (b) set the accessed
bit atomically and use a normal write when setting both bits.

Yes, and this is how our hardware at least works.

The documentation actually provides a more general implementation for
any kind of pte update.  In this case it would logically reduce to
your outline above.  The actual outline in the manual is:
	val = pte_val(entry);
	for(;;) {
		/* Set the pte to 0 to discourage others */
		oldval = 0;
		SWAP(ptep, oldval);
		/* Flush this entry from all MMUs */
		flush_tlb_entry(ptep);
		/* Gather the existing bits */
		val |= oldval;
		/* Did another MMU monkey with it since? */
		if (!*ptep)
			break;
	}
	set_pte(ptep, entry);
which seems far more complicated than necessary just to set these 1 or
2 bits.
