Whilst I'd agree with you over that, how about something like the
following patch:

That then allows one to do...
 Q> make arch makefile
 Q> make arch dep clean modules modules_install bzImage
...and one actually gets asked which architecture one requires.
However, if one omits the "arch" from those lines, it just uses the
native architecture.
Best wishes from Riley.
