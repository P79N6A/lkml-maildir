Please show me I'm wrong, but so far as I can see (from source and
breakpoints) LMbench never touches the SysV IPC code, which is the only
code affected by Mingming's proposed IPC locking changes.  I believe
LMbench tests InterProcessCommunication via pipes and sockets,
not via the SysV IPC msg sem and shm.
If that's right, then your improvement is magical; but we can
hope for even better when the appropriate codepaths are tested.
