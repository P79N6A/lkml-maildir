You *could* do it, but it is bad idea. You don't want to patch
printk.c, that driver printk could be done from interrupt (and you
can't switch consoles at that point), you loose context, etc. What
about doing the simple thing, maybe hack with CRs and be done with
that?
If someone wants more eye candy, they have to patch their kernel with
bootsplash.
