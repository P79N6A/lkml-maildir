On a lot of devices, the "power button" is the resume button.  When you
"turn it off" it suspends, and when you "turn it on" it resumes.

I realise that.  I do work on embedded devices, and this behaviour is
explicitly there to support embedded devices.
I've suggested a workable solution to you which allows both of us to
have the behaviour we both desire from the system.  That sounds like
a negotiated solution to me...
