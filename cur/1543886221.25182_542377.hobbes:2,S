Imo, the best style to relay information is by directly stating facts.
I'm going to try to suggest some improvements on this..

I think previous text is unnecessary. Just tell the reasons why 
volatile is bad and what should be used instead, no need to quote 
people.

Again, I would write this in non-personal way:
"Volatile is often used to prevent optimization, but it is not the
behavior that is actually wanted. Access to data must be protected and 
handled with kernel provided synchronization, mutual exclusion and 
barriers tools. These tools make volatile useless."

The previous suggestion takes care of explaining that, remove this.

Ok

"Spinlock primitives will serialise execution of code regions, and 
memory barrier functions must be used inside spinlocks to force 
loads and stores."

I would say it directly:
"Spinlock will force an implicit memory barrier, thus preventing 
optimizations to data access."

Unnecessary quoting, imo. Tell the same information directly without 
personifying the statement.
