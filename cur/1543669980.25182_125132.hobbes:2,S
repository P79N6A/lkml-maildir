Do you mean to say that the problem lies in the Seagate drives, not in the SiI 
3112 controller and/or its driver code?
I'm seeing SATA as a common component on quite a few motherboards, and am 
definitely seeing SATA drives in the retail channel.  In my experience, all 
of these pieces work flawlessly under Win2k and XP... would love for them to 
do the same under Linux.

Why no fun?  Why can't you say more?  We would really appreciate more 
specifics when you can.  If the problem lies with Seagate, I'd be happy to 
press the issue with them.
