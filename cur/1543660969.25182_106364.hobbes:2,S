Hi, Scott
I have some questions about your CPCI Hot Swap driver.
Would you mind helping me to clarify them ?
1. Why need we clear the EXT bit in the HS_CSR in "disable_slot()"?
I think the EXT bit has not been set at this point.
2. I wonder why we could not receive the #ENUM interrupt when we unpluged
the board after disabling the corresponding slot("echo 0 > power")? It 
seems that the cpci_led_on has some mysterious side effect, but I could 
not find any hints in the spec.
Could you help me?
Thanks in advance.
Best Regards,
-Stan
