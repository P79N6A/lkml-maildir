indeed. The French gov't has made noises that they will relax
domestic use restrictionms, but there is talk, then there is do.
In any case, I've never heard of France attempting prosecute anyone in a
foreign country for having a web site that let French residents download
illicit crypto. Nonetheless, a web site maintainer may want to take certain
precautions to look for ".fr" in the browser's source host, lest the French
secret police bomb the web master's physical site (taking French supranational
law enforcement to sadly, precedented form).
