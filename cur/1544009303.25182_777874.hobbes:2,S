Btw, for the general case, instead of forcing everyone to duplicate, how 
about:
cpumask_var_t cpus;
with_cpumask(cpus) {
   ... code to populate cpus
   smp_call_function_some(...);
} end_with_cpumask(cpus);
Where with_cpumask() allocates cpus, and uses a mutex + static fallback 
on failure.
May need a couple of variants (spinlock + GFP_NOWAIT, mutex with 
sleeping allocation).
