Mmmm, if you have a broken out patch, it'd be preferable. If I were to 
apply the whole of -mjb, I'll get a damned sight better results than 
any of them, but that's not really a fair comparison ;-) I'll can at 
least check it's stable for me that way though. 
I did find your broken-out anon-vma patch, but it's against something
else, maybe half-way up your tree or something, and I didn't bother
trying to fix it ;-)
