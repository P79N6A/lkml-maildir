That should not have changed for quite some time.
Also it depends on the CPU of course.

Otherwise RDTSC can be speculated around and happen outside the protection
of the seqlock and that can sometimes lead to non monotonic time reporting.
Anyways after a lot of discussions it turns out there are ways to archive
this without CPUID and there is a solution implemented for this in ff
tree which I will submit for .25. It's a little complicated though
and not a quick fix.

ltr doesn't synchronize RDTSC.
