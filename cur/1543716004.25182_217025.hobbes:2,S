Kernel only provides emulation of 3 protocols via /dev/psaux: bare PS/2,
IntelliMouse PS/2 and Explorer PS/2. Since your program does not issue
Intellimouse or Explorer protocol initialization sequences it gets just
bare PS/2 protocol data - 2 axis, 3 buttons. Extra buttons are mapped onto
first 3. For exact mapping consult drivers/input/mousedev.c
