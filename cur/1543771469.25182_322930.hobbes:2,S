OK. I've to admit - I am not able to quantify the differences in snappiness 
after  trying hard to switch between vanilla rc5 and rc5-TOD with acpi_pm and 
tsc.  Ignore that for a while. (Although I still feel something is less 
snappy with TOD patches applied -tsc and acpi_pm both) If you have any means 
of measuring  the performance difference - let me know.
At the risk of sounding insane - 
Can any one try listen to music with the TOD patches applied?
I did it with XMMS, amaroK and Juk - All *seem* to play my music slightly 
faster than vanilla. Voices sound as if they were fast forwarded 
(fractionally).
