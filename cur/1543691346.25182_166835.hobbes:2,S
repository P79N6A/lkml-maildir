Subject: [PATCH] Linux 2.6.0-test5 OOPS in sysfs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/9/17/185

A week back I ran into this bug which was causing an OOPS. Andrew Morton
sent me a fix which worked and which I acknowledged on the mailing list
as being the correct fix. However I haven't seen this fix make its way
into the code, so I am sending it again.
Please note that the bug was fixed by Andrew, not me.
thanks,
