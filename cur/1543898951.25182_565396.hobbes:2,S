It happened twice before I gave up on my 2.6.22-rc7 test kernel and went
back to something earlier. I suppose I should double-check that it
wasn't my slab changes, but I really don't think that's it.

There was nothing, apart from a later 'hidd -l' which got stuck on the
same semaphore. I have an hcidump of it happening, at
http://david.woodhou.se/hidd-lockup-dump.txt
 -- it doesn't seem
particularly enlightening though. There's just a disconnection and
reconnect, as happens quite frequently with this mouse, and then we're
deadlocked. I'll build with hidp debugging.
