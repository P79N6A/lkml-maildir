No surprise there. They use a 56-bit major and a 8-bit minor too!
They will need to redo everything for ino_t and others anyway.
In your case, change __dev_t to __u32 (which you may define) and
add padding every place that __dev_t was used. Assuming you are
using a PC, add your padding after the __dev_t.

Tell them to wait for the kernel next time rather than trying to
decide Linux data types all by themselves.
