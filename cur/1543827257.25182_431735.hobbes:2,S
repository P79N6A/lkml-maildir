Do you also see the problem if you decode from file to memory only.
without any display?
NO: You have some problem with your peripherals.
YES: Check for heat and power problems.
	If you are brave you could try some cpuburn variant to put the heat 
	to the maximum.
	WARNING: This could kill your CPU and might void your warranty, 
		since this is not "normal use" of your CPU :-)
Good luck!
