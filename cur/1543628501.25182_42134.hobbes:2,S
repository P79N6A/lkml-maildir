This is better.  I did not want to add another define or a new policy
(i.e. user != kernel maximum priority) but doing so is valid.  Actually,
I think there are a lot of kernel threads where we probably want to set
a priority above the max user-space priority.
There are circumstances in user programming where we want a larger
maximum RT priority, too.  In serious RT programming it wouldn't be
uncommon to see 100-1000 priority levels.  I think having such a wide
range is partly to make programming easier (i.e. a lame crutch) but it
does help to more readily layer real-time tasks.
Now the hard part is abstracting sched_find_first_set for an arbitrary
MAX_RT_PRIO.

Whatever you prefer...

Great, thank you.
Linus, Ingo's patch is fine by me.  Apply?
