Yes and no.  The idea behind the cloneset is that most of the blocks (or files)
do not change in either source or target.  This being the case its only necessary
to update the changed elements.  This means updates are incremental.  Once
the system has figured out what it needs to update its usable and if you access
an element that should be updated you will see the correctly updated version - even 
though backgound resyncing is still in progress.  This type of logic is great for backups.
