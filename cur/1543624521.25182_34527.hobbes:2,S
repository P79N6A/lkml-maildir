I have a similar report with 2.5.6 and PIIX from  Helge Hafting
<helgehaf@aitel.hist.no>:
	I saw nothing unusual until I tried a simple benchmark:
	# hdparm -t /dev/hda
	Nothing happened with the disk, the process
	got stuck in D state immediately and just sits there.
	The drives works though, "ls -R" works for partitions
	on either drive.
It looks like you uncovered or created some race ...
