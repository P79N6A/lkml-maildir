Not particularly. I don't count as a great fan of the config file syntax and 
don't use any configuration myself. I moreover don't own an ICE1724 card, so 
I'm not familiar with it's possibilities and quirks and generally, if this 
thread turns into guiding every user on the list through his/her respective 
problems with ALSA I have to respectfully decline...

The first thing I don't know is why you need an .asoundrc at all. I've CCed 
the alsa-user list -- some subscribers to it probably have experience with 
ice1724 and might be able to get you specific advice if you want.
Renaming .asoundrc seems wrong in any case. If you need anything special for 
  Skype, it seems you could always define it in a seperate "skype" PCM and 
use that only from skype.

Yes, as far as I'm aware you do.

Not sure? Is your receiver on an analog output and are your headphones 
connected directly to a card output as well? In that case, "or" would seem 
to be just a mixer issue, and "and" would be dependent on hardware abilities 
and needs someone who knows your specific card and setup.

It's not working without an .asoundrc?
But -- I'll personally not continue this very specific subthread simply due 
to not having the hardware, nor great generic experience with an .asounrc 
due to not needing it myself. When I do use one, I alway start by googling 
up a few examples and take it from there. Perhaps someone from alsa-user 
will step in.
