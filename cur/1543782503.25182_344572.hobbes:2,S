   >>But it's not needed so why add bloat?
A 'tmpfs_size' option seems to just make sense given the fact that
the mount program has a 'size' option for tmpfs.
It makes sense if tmpfs becomes am initramfs option. 
It's one less thing to do in an init script.
What if you have a root.cpio.gz that requires 200MB to hold, but you
only have 300MB of memory?
50% of total memory wouldn't hold it, but 90% etc. would (tmpfs_size=90%).
