Right, sorry.  The output I had there was from holding down sysrq-p for a
while and then feeding all the EIPs I collected from the serial console
through ksymoops as I didn't have any other way to debug it without
changing the code (I was rushed for time :)).  There was no NMI lockup as
interrupts must have been left enabled.
That other guy seemed to get a stack backtrace, though.
