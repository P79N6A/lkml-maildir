of course, but that doesn't mean it can't re-use X's code, they are
the best drivers we have. you forget everytime that the kernel fbdev
drivers aren't even close, I mean not by a long long way apart from
maybe radeon.

We still have to do state swapping, we just don't expose it,
suspend/resume places state swapping as a requirement.

Of course, how we decide their device is another story best left to a
permissions model, either  /dev or sockets will cover this.

Multiple independent users on one card is always nasty but I can't see
anything to stop this from working.

I've already pointed out the first of these is crap, a protected
daemon is better. displaying printks inside interrupt handlers on a
graphics console is always nasty, especially if the engine waits for
idle space etc.. so ideally this should involve just blasting to the
fb using info we know about like framebuffer/font etc..

Same as 5 really..

Obviously as part of replacing X we must implement all features that X has.

DRM is designed to be incrementally changed, we cannot just break it
however, we can add new features that are enabled for a new userspcae,
but old X servers should continue to work with the new DRMs, this is a
hard requirement that is missing and will be missing every time you
post these lists.

Of course, have you got drivers for these written? this is mostly in
the realms of the driver developer, the modesetting API is going to
have to deal with all these concepts.

not really necessary.. nor should it be... fbset works, something like
it would be good enough..

or other arches can have initial fbdev drivers that get disabled at
run time, stated a few times previously

of coursee again this obvious.
13) text mode
Yes should always be an option.
Some simple ones from me:
14) backwards compatible, an old X server should still run on a new
kernel. I will allow for new options to be enabled at run-time so that
this isn't possible, but just booting a kernel and starting X should
work.
15) re-use as much of the X drivers as possible, otherwise it will KGI.
16) secure - no direct IO or MMIO access, modesetting is slow anyways
having the kernel checking the mmio access won't make it much slower.
17) incremental implementation - so it won't KGI.
