Subject: New Driver For Kallisto GPS Card

I have written a driver for the Kallisto GPS card.  It is accurate to between 1 - 5 microseconds.
The driver can be retrieved from:
http://www.btinternet.com/~david.skingsley/linux/kallisto/
The driver uses the do_settimeofday call within the kernel as this seems to be the only way of doing it.  Is this sensible (I am still feeling my way around)?
If there is anyone out there who can take this driver and re-test it for me I would be grateful.
Thanks,
David.
