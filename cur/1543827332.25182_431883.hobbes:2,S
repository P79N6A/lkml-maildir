I find the whole console/tty layer to be quite confusing to talk
about. I am mixing up console as in where printk goes and console the
video card login device. The part about making everything equal was
directed towards the printk output device.
I see now that you can have tty0-7 assigned to a different console
driver than tty8-63.
Why do I want to do this?
Why do we need 64 predefined tty devices?
Googling around the only example I could find was someone with a VGA
card and a Hercules card. They setup 8 consoles on each card.

How can I change where printk are going at run-time? I didn't know you
could do that.
