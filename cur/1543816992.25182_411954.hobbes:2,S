indeed - very good point. Emin, could you try the patch below [which 
isnt a full solution but should be a good first approximation], does it 
make any difference?

yeah, preallocation is pretty much the only way to go for deterministic 
workloads. Still, networking (and other complex subsystems) can still be 
used in parallel to deterministic tasks - and those should not be 
starved easier when PREEMPT_RT is enabled. In fact, with the patch below 
it could become much more robust - we could in fact achieve to never 
fail an allocation due to being in an atomic context.
