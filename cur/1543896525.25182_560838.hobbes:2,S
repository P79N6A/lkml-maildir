We have mprotect covered. If a process tries to mprotect() some pages
executable, he had writable before, it is no longer trusted in our current
implementation.
We are beginning to feel like poeple do not look at our patches, because we
screwed up the msg-id, so our Patches are not visible as one clean thread. Sorry
for that.
