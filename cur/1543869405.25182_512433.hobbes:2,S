Does this provide additional info to you?

Description VIA Dual PCI Riser
The EXT-PCI is a PCI riser card which expands a PCI slot into two PCI slots.
EXT-PCI slot 1 (lower slot) uses the system resources (Device ID, INT)
of the PCI slot of the motherboard.
EXT-PCI slot 2 (Upper slot) uses device 19 and INT_A.
Upper slot has the problems. TranquilPC does not even respond anymore.
The lower slot is a copy of the normal (single) PCI slot w.r.t. devcie
and irq, it has DN20 and irq 20.
dmesg links ALNKA to IRQ 20. So if ALNKA is INTA both PCI cards should
share IRQ 20?
