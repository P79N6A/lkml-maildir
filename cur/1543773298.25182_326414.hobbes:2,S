I figured it out. This workaround has only just been enabled on my board since 
I updated my BIOS from the 1.6 to 1.7 revision. Clearly the workaround's 
"detection" isn't sufficiently vigorous. I can demonstrate 2.6.12 
mis-detecting my nForce3 board with the 1.6 BIOS, and correctly enabling the 
workaround with the 1.7 BIOS.
It's probably not worth fixing, but it might be a useful datapoint in future 
(make sure people with MSI MS-7030 boards update their BIOS).
