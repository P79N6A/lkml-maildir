In case it isn't clear, I need to be told where I can get a particular
tree from and who should be contacted in case of problems (I do not troll
through the MAINTAINERS file).  I can currently handle git trees and
quilt series.  I am willing to consider other formats/scms.  I also do
not mind having multiple trees (or branches or series files) for a single
subsystem/maintainer.
Series files must be annotated with an indication of the place in Linus'
tree that they are based on using the following format:
# BASE <some identification of a place in Linus' tree>
This base can be a SHA1 or a release tag or one of the ...-git<n> or the
output from "git describe".  Alternatively, you can be based on another
tree in linux-next by using:
# NEXT_BASE <name of a tree in linux-next>
The names are in the Next/Trees file in each release and normally do not
change.
Also you may (if you like) delimit the parts of the series you want in
linux-next by using:
# NEXT_PATCHES_START
.
.
# NEXT_PATCHES_END
There can be multiple such sections.
