Steven Baur has kindly provided a source rpm which includes
module-init-tools 0.7 as well as modutils, allowing you to install it
without screwing your package manager.  I haven't tested it (Debian
here), but it looks to be the right solution.
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/modules/modutils-2.4.21-4.src.rpm
This is also the location of the module-init-tools from now on, as I
release them.
Cheers,
Rusty.
PS.  Am returning to .au today.  Once I'm back (and recovered),
     development will speed up again, I promise.
