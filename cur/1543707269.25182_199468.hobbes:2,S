You should usually try to declare the spinlock near the things it protects, in
the hope that they'll be in the same cacheline.  If we blow 128 bytes for
every spinlock, things will get slower, not faster.
ie. like any optimization, the default should be not to do it unless there's
a reason[1]
Cheers,
Rusty.
[1] An optimization being defined here as something with tradeoffs.
    Doing the obviously superior thing is not an optimization, it's simply
    being a decent coder.
