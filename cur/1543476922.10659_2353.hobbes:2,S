Are you joking ? Even two constructs like
  A. someclass var(1);
  B. someclass var=1;
are NOT equal ! And there it's possible to write program where first construct
will be Ok while second will be considered as error (sample below) ! Or more
obscure sample (if sample above is not obscure enough :-):
-- cut --
struct A {
  int a;
  virtual fooa() {}
};
struct B {
  int b;
  virtual foob() {}
};
class C: public A, public B {
};
A *a;
B *b;
C *c;
-- cut --
What call is more effective: c->fooa(); or c->foob(); ? Or which assignment
is faster: a=c or b=c ? This is depends from compiler of course ! In case of
egcs 1.1.1 c->fooa(); and a=c is more effective ... C++ is FULL of such obscure
things :-(( And thus non-acceptable for ANY project if speed and reliability
matters.

Yes. Of course. But C is small and very simple language while C++ is HUGE
complex monster :-(( And thus it's not so problematic to understood what
C compiler doing (especially without -O :-) and almost impossible to understood
the same about C++ ...

You'll need to know HUNDREDS of C++ quicks instead ...

If you'll use C++ as C then may be (not sure). But if you'll use objects you
are tied to VERY LIMITED C++ object model.

Of course not ! Compiler is limited by object model and poor design. If you'll
use C++ as "C with classes" (it was initial name AFAIK :-) not as C that is...

We DECREASE complexity of kernel by using VERY SIMPLE language where are NO
automagic contructors, destructors, etc. Object model is created by hand and
as such not suffer from language limitations... Take a look on structures full
of pointers to functions -- this is exactly C++-style objects created by hand.
But we could do quite a lot of tricks with such objects not imaginable in C++...

Ok. Just a short example.
-- C++ code --
#include <iostream>
class someclass {
  int i;
public:
  explicit someclass(int _i) : i(_i) {}
  virtual foo() {
    std::cout << i << endl;
  }
};
void test(someclass& x) {
  x.foo();
}
void main (void) {
  someclass a(1);
  test(a);
}
-- C code --
#include <stdio.h>
struct someclass {
  int i;
  int (*foo)(struct someclass*);
};
int someclass_deffoo(struct someclass* x) {
  printf("%d\n",x->i);
}
/*
 * int someclass_otherfoo(struct someclass* x) {
 *   printf("%d\n",x->i<<1);
 * }
 */
void test(struct someclass* x) {
  x->foo(x);
}
int main (void) {
  struct someclass a={1,someclass_deffoo};
  test(&a);
/*
 * a.foo=someclass_otherfoo;
 * test(&a);
 */
  return 0;
}
-- cut --
C++ code is shoter, yes, but test() in C++ code will generate something like
-- cut --
        movl 4(%esp),%eax
        movl 4(%eax),%edx
        pushl %eax
        movl 8(%edx),%eax
        call *%eax
        addl $4,%esp
        ret
-- cut --
while C code will generate
-- cut --
        movl 4(%esp),%eax
        pushl %eax
        movl 4(%eax),%edx
        call *%edx
        addl $4,%esp
        ret
-- cut --
One additional inevitable memory reference :-)
And more: uncomment few lines, commented in C sample above and you'll see
that C++ object model is even more limited :-))
Yes, I know that if there are will be a lot of functions in C version of
someclass then you'll got very big structure while size of C++ version
will not change. Big deal :-) Add table (just like C++ compiler does :-)
and be happy. But in C++ you COULD NOT remove this additional memory
reference even for simplest classes ! And you could not change nature of
your class in run-time -- it's hardcoded in compile-time.

Please reimplement full (with uncommented lines) C example in C++ classes
without loss of effectiveness :-))) This is not Linux kernel. This is just
short example.

Not use classes ? Why in this case use C++ at all ? Just for templates and
for exceptions ? Hm. May be. I'm not sure if this is very wise idea though.

C++ is just big non-shapen heap of different things, not clear language like
Ada or even Java. Some concepts there are usefull, some not. But it's total
mess as whole.

And this is exactly where C++ is not big help. Since most problems in kernel
are some race conditions and obscure deadlocks not just size of codebase.

C at least has one advantage: it's simple language very close to hardware
(and assembler :-) C++ language has poor object model, A LOT OF quicks and
REALLY BAD support for modular programming (all this "include files" stuff
is pure shame for modern language). Why use this monster ?
P.S. Ah, almost forgot about my example with var(1); and var=1; ...
Just
-- cut --
struct someclass {
  explicit someclass(int) {}
};
-- cut --
will be enough, but if you need more obscure sample here it is:
-- cut --
struct someclass {
  someclass(int) {}
private:
  someclass(someclass&);
};
-- cut --
