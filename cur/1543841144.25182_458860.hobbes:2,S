I re-reviewed SRCU and found no issues.  So I am OK with it going upstream
if it is useful.
I do have a comment patch below to flag an "attractive nuisance".
Several people have asked about moving the final synchronize_sched()
out of the critical section, but this turns out to be not just scary,
but actually unsafe.  ;-)
Again, this patch just adds verbiage to an existing comment.
