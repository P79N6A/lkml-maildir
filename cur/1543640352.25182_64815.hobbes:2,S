Wouldn't it be much easier to ask -very few- people (GnuPG/SSL/SSH teams
primarily)  to use /dev/super-reliable-mathematically-proven-random if
available, instead of asking much larger crowd to hack their code? This
will be backward compatible, and at the same time offers a much better
randomness for those who care about it. Myself, I read 128-bit session
keys for multiple, not-so-secure, short connections from /dev/random and
it would be sad if it runs out of data.
Also, /dev/random may take data from /dev/super-...random until it sucks 
it dry, and then switches to less secure sources. This will guarantee that 
the enthropy of readings is -not worse than-, and for moderate requests is 
much better.
