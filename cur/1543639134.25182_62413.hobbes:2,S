If you can prove that a MUST_NOT_HOLD(foolock) will never
trigger because it is already protected by other locks,
then what's the point of having that foolock in the first
place ?   (since the region is already protected...)
If the foolock is actually protecting something, then by
definition lock contention is possible and the kernel will
Oops in MUST_NOT_HOLD(foolock).

Agreed.
Btw, the MUST_HOLD macro _is_ straightforward and extremely
useful. IMHO it'd be a shame to have only the SCSI code use it ;)
