Hello list,
I have observed a strange slowdown with the 2.6.18 kernel in VMware. 
This happened both with the SUSE flavor and with the FC6 installer CD 
(which I am trying right now). In both cases, the kernel "takes its 
time" after the following text strings:
* Checking if this processor honours the WP bit even in supervisor mode... Ok.
* Checking 'hlt' instruction... OK.
What's with that?
