I remember this from VAX/VMS "system manager school"!
"Don't ever read anybody's data from the SYSTEM account...."
The text read could write a whole command-procedure to
the answer-back buffer, then tell it to answer-back! The
result would be the execution of anything from a privileged
account.
I don't think the built-in VT100-220 emulation has an
answer-back buffer, but there still are RS-232C terminals
out there........
