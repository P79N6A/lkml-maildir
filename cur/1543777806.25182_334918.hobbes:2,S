Hi Jiri, 
The patch grabs reference counts to pdev structures, but almost never
decreases the reference counts. 
If you are working in a team, and want others to be able to continue
where you left off, you should add a comment, even if it is repetitive
to state what needs to be done. 
As far as I can see, you grab a reference to the "pdev" on 
initialization, and never release it. Or you only release it in 
certain error conditions. Would this make the driver unable to 
be unloaded and reloaded? That would not be good. 
	Roger.
