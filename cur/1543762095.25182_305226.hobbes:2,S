Considering msft don't do full options hardware detection until 
after GUI shell is up, next speed up could simply be start from 
hibernate?  They already do a hardware signature, and if hardware 
changed you may need a new license anyway :-)  Pay per cold boot?
Noisy startup?  2.6 has good solution in default kernel build, 
display milestones during startup or super quiet loader option 
passed from boot?  "dmesg -qq" thru "dmesg -vv" stir anyone?
