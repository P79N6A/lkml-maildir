No, you tell your boot loader to use this default with the kernel.
In LILO, it's something like
image = /somewhere/something
  append = "sb=0x220,5,1,5"
or such. Or, if your card supports PnP, use ISAPNP. Works remarkably
well. (Though I still don't get all the mixers on my AWE32 ... not
sure why.)
