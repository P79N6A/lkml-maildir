I can't imagine binary compatibility having been a reason. At least for
the RH distros it really isn't kernel wise. At All.
PREEMPT was (and is?) a stability risk and so you'll see RHEL4 not
having it enabled. But it has nothing to do with in-kernel binary
compatibility; that just doesn't exist, kernel.org or distro alike.
