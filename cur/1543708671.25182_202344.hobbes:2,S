FWIW, I think the silly one-liner is actually an improvement, since
then we use a hardware register for the counter, instead of a stack
location.  I was concerned about not increasing the register pressure
with the patch; it looked very tight already, and I couldn't tell it
wouldn't be exceeded with some older compiler that failed to eliminate
the frame pointer, for example.
If that's the way to go, I'll post a patch that leaves the +r alone.
If using a stack location for the counter could possibly be as
efficient as using a register, I'd convert  "+r" (lines) to "+g".  Any
preferences?
