Me?  I much preferred your original, much sparer, nopagedone patch
(labelled "uglyh as hell" by hch).  I dislike passing lots of args
down a level so they can be passed up again to the library function.
In particular, I feel queasy (fear loss of control) about passing a
pmd_t* down to a filesystem, which I'd prefer to have no access to
such.  But I may be in a minority, and the decision won't be mine.
