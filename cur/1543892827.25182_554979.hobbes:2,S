grow so much compared to *which other modules*?  the ones that came
with your distro?  if that's the case, try installing your new modules
with
  # make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 modules_install
that makes a *huge* difference in the size of the installed modules,
as i learned when i first ran across this on my fedora core system.
