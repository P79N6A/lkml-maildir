Linux doesn't really support this configuration at the moment.
Historically Intel hasn't supported different stepping cpus in the same
system, much less different frequency cpus. I know the TSC time source
code won't handle it properly, and there are other users of rdtsc that
might cause problems. Other concerns would be users of cpu_khz
(scheduler?) and cpufreq code. 
I've heard that AMD has introduced this as a possible configuration, and
Intel may have changed their support story as well, so this may need to
be addressed.

The TSC syncing code is still there, but it runs only once at boot. Thus
it will sync the cpus, but then won't account for the TSC drift between
them.
The only way to get around this is to use an alternate time source, such
as the ACPI-PM time source (clock=pmtmr), or even the PIT (clock=pit).
ACPI-PM still uses the TSC for delay() so it may still have issues, so
be warned.
