Perhaps I'm missing something, but my idea was that the manager would
not be sent any signals by other threads.

I think you've misunderstood my idea. The data that is copied is
simply the information about what threads are announcing an intetion
to accept what signals.

But the POSIX standard permits such races -- no?

Right. All that is taken care of. The mechanism just makes sure that
the actual kill or sigqueue call is directed to a thread (process) that
is willing to accept the signal. The race potential is only when 
thread A is concurrently blocking signal N while thread B is trying to
send it and selected A as the destination. But that seems solvable.
