I said it was possible, not that it was nice and elegant ;) I know it's
ugly at the moment - which is exactly why people have been asking for
an i2c-core conversion.

I2C can't really probe either. We abuse a transaction type we known most
chips will reply to but otherwise ignore to achieve chip presence
detection. It did damage in the past (killing Thinkpad laptops) and
could do again in the future. So, having board-specific lists of chips
to avoid probing would help.

What we have in the works is "I2C chip type X at address A". No
interrupt nor platform data at this point. But once the conversion to
the device driver model is done, I guess it'll come naturally if needed.
