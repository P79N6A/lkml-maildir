Subject: [GIT/Cogito question] Access to specific versions of the kernel

I finally succeeded to get cg-clone to work on 
linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
I can see the 2.6.13-rc4 is in there and can use cg-diff to see the
difference between the current tree and 2.6.13-rc4. 
But how to I extract the 2.6.13-rc4 source from the tree?
Or even more complicated: I would like to make a branch based on
2.6.13-rc4 and work from there. At some point I would like to jump to
2.6.13-rc5 (or 2.6.13). I do not want to have the in-between changes
tickle in. I.e. I need something like "cvs rtag -b -r 2.6.13-rc4 mytress"
and "cvs update -j 2.6.13-rc4 -j 2.6.13-rc5".

How do I do that with cogito or git?
