I know it's repetitious, but it's nice to maintain a changelog entry along
with the patch.  Especially when seventy people have asked "wtf is this patch
for?".
Implementation-wise, do you really need to clone-and-own the mem.c
functions?  Would it not be sufficient to do
	ptr = arch_translate_mem_ptr(page, ptr);
inside mem.c?

Please find a .h file for the function prototypes.
