The in kernel API already exists in drivers/md/dm.h, see dm-ioctl.c
for example code that uses this.

True, all the devices are exposed in /dev/device-mapper.  What we do
with LVM2 is stick with the /dev/<vg_name>/<lv_name> scheme, where the
lv is a symlink to the relevant node in the device-mapper dir.  That
way people only see the top level devices, unless they peek under the
hood by looking at /dev/device-mapper.

The thing that you've missed is that ranges of sectors are mapped by
dm onto 'targets', these targets are instances of a 'target_type'
virtual class.  You can define your own target types in a seperate
module and register them using the
int dm_register_target(struct target_type *t);
function (see <linux/device-mapper.h>).  We originally intended all
the standard target types to be defined in seperate modules, but that
seemed silly considering the tiny size of them (eg, < 200 lines for striping).
The targets type that we will be using in LVM2 are:
io-err - errors every io
linear
striped
snapshot, and snapshot origin
mirror (used to provide pvmove support as well as mirroring).
(both the snapshot targets and mirroring target will use kcopyd for
efficient copying using kiobufs.)
So if you invent a new form of striping, just implement a new target type.

No, there's a seperate mirror target that Patrick Caulfields working
on at the moment.

Suspending a device flushes all pending io to the device, ie. all io
that has been through the driver but not yet completed.  Once you have
suspended you are free to loaded a new mapping table into the device
(this is essential for implementing snapshots and pvmove).  When the
new mapping is in place you just have to resume the device and away
you go.
