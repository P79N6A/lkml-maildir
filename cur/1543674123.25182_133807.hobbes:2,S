 You can take a look at lib/kobject.c:kset_hotplug()

 envp points to the first empty slot of the environment being
 constructed, so no, I am not overwriting anything.

 The code is ready to add a new environment variable if needed. If we
 really don't need more variables, it could be simplified, but I don't
 think it is so important.

 OK, I just added:
	if (num_envp < 1)
		return -ENOMEM;

 The envp array we get is reset to zero, so anything we don't explicitly
 set is already NULL.

 The num_envp issue was real, and anyway, I appreciate a little
 feedback, it seams like people don't hack the kernel on Sunday :-P
 Thanks
