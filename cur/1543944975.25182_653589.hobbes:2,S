Hi Paul,

this patch is very interesting.
BTW:
Are you think this function name must be "relative" ?
I think "relative" implies ordered set.
but linux bitmap is abstraction of unordered set.
if possible, i prefer another name.
end up, bitmap_relative is map as pecial case, i think.

agreed with node_relative idea.
I think this is very useful.
Thanks!
