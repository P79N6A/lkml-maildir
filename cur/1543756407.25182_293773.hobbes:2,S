More memory will allow the kernel to keep more cache in memory.  You can
see how much memory the kernel is using for cache with free(1).
That does not sound like your problem, though.  It sounds like you want
the kernel to do more _read-ahead_, e.g. cache things _before_ you even
need them (and then you might want more memory to actually keep all of
the stuff alive in the cache, but that is a secondary problem).
Unfortunately, since you are doing random reads, it is very hard for the
kernel to do intelligent read-ahead.
What you can do is pre-fault the entire file into memory.  This is not a
bad idea if you know you are going to ultimately read much of the file.
You can prefault the file automatically and asynchronously using
posix_fadvise().  Example:
	if (posix_fadvise (fd, 0, 0, POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED))
		perror ("posix_fadvise");
See posix_fadvise(2) for more information.
It might also be faster to use mmap(1) over read(2).  Then you can use
madvise().
Best,
