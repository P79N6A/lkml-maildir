I'm sure you're right, but my goal is to improve all the Kconfig help
messages (clarity, accuracy, consistency) and so at this time I want
to limit myself to changes to the help descriptions.
If somebody will add documentation for this or any other subsystem
I will gladly refer to it but in the meantime I'm sure we can come up
with a wording which everybody can agree with.
The point of view I'm coming from is that of a non-kernel-developer
who has to make a choice about some feature of the kernel which they
don't understand. When I'm configuring a kernel I appreciate a bit more
detail in the help text.  I want to provide enough information to help
the user make a rational choice, or give them some idea about what they
are agreeing to put into their kernel. If they still don't understand,
there will be a suggested safe answer.
I'll see if I can make it briefer, if there's any fat which can be
trimmed away.
Current wording:
