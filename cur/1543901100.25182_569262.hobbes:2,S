Hello,
First of all excuse me for my bad english, this is my first time in LKML.
I'm not a programmer, but i'm a Gygabyte 7DPXDW+ owner (thanks ebay...), then i tried to compile a 2.6.20 patched kernel with an adapted version of the Kumar Gala's code as i found in:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/30/379
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/30/385
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/25/211
Well, the modified patch end related fixes applies well and compile, i get the pca954x module to work with:
modprobe pca954xx force_pca9540=0,0x70
the dmesg command says:
i2c-5: Virtual I2C bus (Physical bus i2c-0, multiplexer 0x70 port 0)
i2c-6: Virtual I2C bus (Physical bus i2c-0, multiplexer 0x70 port 1)
pca954x 0-0070: Registered 2 virtual buses for I2C mux pca9540
and the i2cdetect says:
  Installed I2C busses:
    i2c-6       smbus           Virtual I2C (i2c-0, mux 70:01)
    i2c-5       smbus           Virtual I2C (i2c-0, mux 70:00)
    i2c-0       smbus           SMBus AMD768 adapter at 50e0
    i2c-4       i2c             NVIDIA I2C Device
    i2c-3       i2c             NVIDIA I2C Device
    i2c-2       i2c             NVIDIA I2C Device
    i2c-1       smbus           saa7133[0]
This means that's all ok:), the module works!
Now the problem, the motherboard has two LM90 multiplexed by the PCA9540, but the sensors command only shows one chip directly attached to the amd768 bus:
lm90-i2c-0-4c
Adapter: SMBus AMD768 adapter at 50e0
M/B Temp:    +37°C  (low  =    +0°C, high =   +70°C)
CPU Temp:  +47.5°C  (low  =  +0.0°C, high = +70.0°C)
M/B Crit:    +85°C  (hyst =   +75°C)
CPU Crit:    +80°C  (hyst =   +70°C)
I tried to force the probe of the lm90 module with:
modprobe lm90 force_lm90=5,0x4c
or
modprobe lm90 force_lm90=6,0x4c
but the sensors command only seen the i2c-0 address.
The strange thing is that sensors-detect recognize both the LM90 on the virtual buses (plus one on the real bus):
sensors-detect
# sensors-detect revision 1.413 (2006/01/19 20:28:00)
This program will help you determine which I2C/SMBus modules you need to
load to use lm_sensors most effectively. You need to have i2c and
lm_sensors installed before running this program.
Also, you need to be `root', or at least have access to the /dev/i2c-*
files, for most things.
If you have patched your kernel and have some drivers built in, you can
safely answer NO if asked to load some modules. In this case, things may
seem a bit confusing, but they will still work.
It is generally safe and recommended to accept the default answers to all
questions, unless you know what you're doing.
 We can start with probing for (PCI) I2C or SMBus adapters.
 You do not need any special privileges for this.
 Do you want to probe now? (YES/no):
Probing for PCI bus adapters...
Use driver `i2c-amd756' for device 00:07.3: AMD-768 System Management
Probe succesfully concluded.
We will now try to load each adapter module in turn.
Module `i2c-amd756' already loaded.
If you have undetectable or unsupported adapters, you can have them
scanned by manually loading the modules before running this script.
 To continue, we need module `i2c-dev' to be loaded.
 If it is built-in into your kernel, you can safely skip this.
i2c-dev is already loaded.
 We are now going to do the adapter probings. Some adapters may hang halfway
 through; we can't really help that. Also, some chips will be double detected;
 we choose the one with the highest confidence value in that case.
 If you found that the adapter hung after probing a certain address, you can
 specify that address to remain unprobed. That often
 includes address 0x69 (clock chip).

Some chips are also accessible through the ISA bus. ISA probes are
typically a bit more dangerous, as we have to write to I/O ports to do
this. This is usually safe though.

Then i think it's all right, both 4c addresses are on virtual buses (on the phisical one there are a UU statement) but a:
sensors *-i2c-5-*
or:
sensors *-i2c-6-*
results in:
No sensors found!
I read that this drive is able to determine if a device is attached to the virtual or the phisical bus and manage to not activate the first one to avoid duplicates, is that true? Is there a way to force the devices attached to the virtual bus to work? Or simply i made a mistake?
Thank for the patience and a big thank for your work.
