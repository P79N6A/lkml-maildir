The DTMF detection is broken since kernel 2.0.x. I have a patch for a 
2.2 kernel which may manually be applied 2.4 kernels with some manual 
work. It fixes an overflow problem in the goertzel algorithm (which 
does the basic tone detection) and changes the algorithm to detect the 
DTMF pairs. If interested, I can try to recover that patch.
