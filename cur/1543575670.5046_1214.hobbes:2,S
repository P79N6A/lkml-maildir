My setup
-A standard install of RedHat 7.0 with the 2.2.16smp w/ hand compiled X
 4.0.1 to support xinerama
-Tyan tiger 133 s1834 motherboard (VIA Apollo Pro133A Chipset)
-256mb PC133 RAM
-Two 800 Mhz PIII eb Slot-1 CPU's
-Matrox g450 32MB RAM dual-heal AGP video card w/ hand compiled X driver
 from matrox
My problem
from /var/log/message at startup:
mtrr: v1.35a (19990819) Richard Gooch (rgooch@atnf.csiro.au)
<snip>
CPU0: Intel Pentium III (Coppermine) stepping 03
<snip>
CPU1: Intel Pentium III (Coppermine) stepping 03
Total of 2 processors activated (3194.88 BogoMIPS).
<snip>
checking TSC synchronization across CPUs: passed.
mtrr: your CPUs had inconsistent variable MTRR settings
mtrr: probably your BIOS does not setup all CPUs
and immediately after starting X:
kernel: mtrr: base(0xd4000000) is not aligned on a size(0x1800000) boundary
last message repeated 2 times
and finally:
%cat /proc/mtrr 
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 256MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0xd0000000 (3328MB), size=  64MB: write-combining, count=1
reg02: base=0xd5800000 (3416MB), size=   8MB: write-combining, count=1
I would like to know what, if anything, is wrong and what I can do about it.
Cheers!
