encountered the following error while trying to customize 2.4.22-10mdk on
Mandrake Linux 9.2 . I was in the sound module, and when I clicked on the 
alsa sub-menu it barfed - and always does at this point. 
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
