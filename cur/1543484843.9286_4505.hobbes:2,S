Ahh, now I see your argument. 
You are correct. The scheduler code is special, and the scheduler will
leave lock_depth set even though it has released the lock. I did that as a
performance optimization, because I thought nobody would ever care, but
it's obvious that yes, you do have to also set lock_depth to -1 inside the
scheduler.
Good point, sorry for not catching on to what you meant.
