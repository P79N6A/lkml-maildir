Fair enough... according to Documentation/infiniband/core_locking.txt,
the only driver methods that cannot sleep are:
    create_ah
    modify_ah
    query_ah
    destroy_ah
    bind_mw
    post_send
    post_recv
    poll_cq
    req_notify_cq
    map_phys_fmr
and I don't think ehca does an hcall from any of those.  Of course
there might be other driver-internal code paths that I don't know
about.  Maybe do a quick audit and then stick might_sleep() in the
hcall functions to catch any mistakes?
