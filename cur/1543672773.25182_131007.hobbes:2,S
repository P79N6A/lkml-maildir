What's the difference? If the code uses 0x12345670ul, but 0x12345678ul
would be correct, who is going to find the correct change without the
documentation. Maybe someone reverse engineering the meaning of those
bits. But most just accept the fact that one is better than the other
without understanding why.
And one big binary blob is better than the other. Same here.
Anyway, _should be ok_ is not _definitely legal in all countries_, so
we basically both say "see a lawyer".
