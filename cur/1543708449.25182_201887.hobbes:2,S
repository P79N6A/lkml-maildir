Although, this simplifies the development and maintenance effort, having a
single driver to drive both controllers or two independent drivers is not
always our decision. Most often, it would be Dell's preference.

So it would be. We would make the controller and devices detection PCI
ordered for 2.6 and preferred ordered for lk 2.4. A patch for unified-alpha1
would be posted for this change soon.

Currently, IA64 has only 1.18 series of drivers as supported ones. 2.x
driver is not tested on this platform.
