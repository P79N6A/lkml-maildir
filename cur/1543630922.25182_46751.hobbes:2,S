The move was mainly motivated by long term programmer direction, not a
Config.in user interface change (which in hindsight could have been
done better).
Davicom and other tulip-related files are being organized into
drivers/net/tulip, and eventually they will be sharing code from a
tulip_lib.c file or similar.
My long term idea is to have a shared lib providing the core for drivers
which support:
21040/1 chips
21140/2/3 chips
Xircom chips
...and then all other tulip clones will probably be rolled into a
"tulip_clone.c".
i.e. organize the tulip chips into major families, with a central
tulip_lib.c from which they all share code.
