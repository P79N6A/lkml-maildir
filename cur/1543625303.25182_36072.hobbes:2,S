There's a reason why I live in Boston.  My house is 20 minutes from
downtown Boston, and 15 minutes from MIT/Harvard Sqare/Cambridge, and
three years ago, my 3 bedroom, 1.5 bedroom house with a large country
kitchen sitting on a sixth of an acre of land cost me $168,000 dollars
(I pay ~$700/month mortgage).
(I love to really piss off Silly Valley types by pointing this out.  :-)
Best of all, I don't have to live out in the middle of nowhere (the
Boston Symphony, lots of amateur/semi-professional/professional
theater productions, etc.), and there are lots of smart people to
socialize with.
