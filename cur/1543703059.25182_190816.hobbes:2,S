Odd.
5083  16:00:30.714217 open("lock/trigger", O_WRONLY|O_NONBLOCK) = 5 <0.000013>
5083  16:00:30.714260 fcntl64(5, F_GETFL) = 0x801 (flags O_WRONLY|O_NONBLOCK) <0.000004>
5083  16:00:30.714287 fcntl64(5, F_SETFL, O_WRONLY|O_NONBLOCK) = 0 <0.000004>
5083  16:00:30.714309 write(5, "\0", 1) = 1 <1.637019>
5083  16:00:32.351378 close(5)          = 0 <0.000005>
Seems innocuous.  What filesystem type is lock/trigger on?
Can you generate a kernel profile of this activity?
Boot with `profile=1', copy this:
SM=/boot/System.map
TIMEFILE=/tmp/prof.time
sudo readprofile -r
sudo readprofile -M10
time $@
readprofile -n -v -m $SM | sort -n +2 | tail -40 | tee $TIMEFILE >&2
into /tmp/foo and do
	/tmp/foo whatever-command-you-were-using
Thanks.
