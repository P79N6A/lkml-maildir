Or is such a situation not possible at all? Are bad sectors the only 
reason that might have caused this? That sounds a little strange to me, 
that would have been a very unlikely concentration of conincidences, IMO. 
That's why I still think there are no bad sectors at all (at least not 
because of this). Is there any way to actually find out?
