With the patch and Linus' modifications, the boot progresses further
than with Linus' mods alone.  However, it now fails a bit later when
it comes the CardBus bridge in the docking station (following output
manually typed from the console):
...

For your reference, at this stage we appear to have a cascade of three
bridges between a potential device (currently empty CardBus slot) and
the CPU
                1              2      3
CPU Southbridge -> PCI Express -> PCI -> CardBus
Note that the messages before this log, e.g., from ohci1394, also indicate
that the peripherals in the docking station still remain inaccessible due to
unmapped memory (all reads return 0xff). 
Many thanks for your effort,
  Andreas
