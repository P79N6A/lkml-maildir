Do you mean request_mem_region()?

request_mem_region() for ISA memory is another problem point. The few drivers
that use it seem to assume that the ISA memory base is 0. This won't work on
non-PC machines, since ISA memory may be somewhere else in the address space,
and more important, there already may be something different at address 0,
which breaks request_mem_region(). On a PC the first 16 MB of RAM (with some
holes at e.g. 0xa0000) overlap with ISA memory space, but not on other
architectures.
For ioremap() we have a hack on PPC (PReP/CHRP) that adds isa_mem_base if the
bus address to map falls in the first 16 MB area, but this cannot work for
request_mem_region(). I do have my full memory map (RAM) marked in /proc/iomem.
So once again I vote for the introduction of
isa_{request,release}_mem_region(), just like we already have isa_readb() and
friends.
