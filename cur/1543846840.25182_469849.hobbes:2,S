Subject: 2.6.19-rc1: kexec broken on x86_64

Kexec is broken on x86_64 under 2.6.19-rc1.
Or rather - kexec works ok under 2.6.19-rc1, but something related to
the vmlinux format has probably changed and kexec-tools fails to load
a vmlinux from 2.6.19-rc1.
Loading bzImage works as usual, but vmlinux does not load properly.
The kexec binary fails with the following message:
Overlapping memory segments at 0x351000
sort_segments failed
/ #
Again, running kexec under 2.6.19-rc1 works ok. But rebooting into a
2.6.19-rc1 vmlinux does not work correctly. This is regardless of
which kexec-tools tree used.
A coarse-grained bisect says that the problem was introduced in 2.6.18-git7.
But maybe this is a kexec-tools issue?
I've used Horms testing tree as usual, tested the latest version
5aa1e11a27f1dc1ce96f850966e94f68c9cd8bce to be exact. Horms testing
tree that can be found here:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/horms/kexec-tools-testing.git;a=summary
I've also tried version 71d2424c8ac4f93a60c3eee5c95df269f584a9da of
Eric's main tree:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/kexec-tools.git;a=summary
That tree is unfortunately broken on x86_64. You need to apply the
follwing patch on x86_64 to be able to compile:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/horms/kexec-tools-testing.git;a=commit;h=6492b850281a106c042221b836a693141fd9b49b
None of the kexec-tools trees can load a 2.6.19-rc1 vmlinux under
x86_64. i386 works fine.
