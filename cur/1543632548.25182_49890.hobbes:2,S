Comparing 2.4.19pre8aa3 and 2.4.19pre9aa2 on quad Xeon:
Both kernels configured with CONFIG_2GB=y and CONFIG_HIGHIO=y.
dbench 64/192 on various filesystems had a 2-20% improvement.
(average 5 runs).
tbench 192 throughput up over 300%.
LMBench pipe bandwidth and latency improved.
The regression in OSDB aggregate simple report compared to
non-aa kernels is gone.
