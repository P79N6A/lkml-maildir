Hiya,
This patch updates some personal info in the CREDITS file.
I'm no longer actively involved in Keyspan driver work so shouldn't really be 
listed as a Maintainer here.
Do however field the occasional question on them and as I'm dropping the 
misc.nu domain, want to ensure people can find me should they need to.
Cheers,
Hugh
