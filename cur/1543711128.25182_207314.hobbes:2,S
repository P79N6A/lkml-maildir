Much improved!
Since audit_receive_filter() is only called with audit_netlink_sem
held, it cannot race with either audit_del_rule() or audit_add_rule(),
so the list_for_each_entry_rcu()s may be replaced by
list_for_each_entry()s, and the rcu_read_{un,}lock()s removed.
Not a fatal problem, just a bit of unnecessary overhead.
The others look good!

Ditto!
