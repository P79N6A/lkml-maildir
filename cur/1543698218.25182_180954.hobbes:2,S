Hi there,
I am currently experiencing a weird problem using /dev/ircomm0 to connect to my Sony Ericsson t68i mobile phone using Debian GNU/Linux and Kernel 2.6.0-test11.
Upon trying to connect via /dev/ircomm0 using dip -t or minicom, I get the following kernel message:
"Detected buggy peer, adjust mtt to 10us"
After reading on the lists and living in google for days, I found some posts from Jean Tourrilhes, where he is writing about a connection problem due to a kernel irda problem and / or buggy Ericsson phones.
(i.e. 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0306.2/1964.html
)
Either way, after checking on his patch I recognized, that the 2.6 kernel doesnt really differ from his proposal. 
I then tried playing around with sysctl_min_tx_turn_time but unfortunately... this didn't help either.
Connecting to the phone works fine on my old 2.4.19 so now I am wondering if anyone here has a similar problem after upgrading the kernel.
Since the only usable messages I found so far regarding this problem were from mailing lists, I figured this might be the best place to ask.
The funny thing I maybe should tell you as well is, I have no problems connecting to a friends mobile, which is actually a siemens.
Thanks in advance for your answers and your time
Alexander Heuer
