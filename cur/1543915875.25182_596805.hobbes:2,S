I've bisected it down to this trio of changes:
- b0cb1a19d05b8ea8 Replace CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND with CONFIG_HIBERNATION
- 296699de6bdc7171 Introduce CONFIG_SUSPEND for suspend-to-Ram and standby
- 673d5b43daa00b42 ACPI: restore CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP
The actual change is probably in the second of those.
I've seen the comment that the change may just be cosmetic, but I'll leave 
it to others to confirm that (and if so, judge if it is desirable or not).
Cheers,
Frans Pop
