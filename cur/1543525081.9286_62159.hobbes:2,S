freepages.* is critically important for allowing the user to define the
"headroom" of free memory maintained for ATOMIC allocations.  On busy
networked machines, this is absolutely vital.  For user-mode
allocations, it's never going to be that important except as a way of
allowing some slack as we start up the page stealer in the background.
