Sounds like your first step is to set up acpi.  What distro are you 
using?  What happens if you do "echo -n mem > /sys/power/state"?
The patches you need are to make the ahci disk interface resume 
properly.  There's a series of 6 patches from Forrest Zhao which he 
posted to the linux-ide list, and they apply cleanly to 2.6.18-rc1-mm1.
