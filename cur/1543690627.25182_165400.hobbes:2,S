**update**  Had written the following and then updated to 2.6.0-test4-bk8
and found the module_char_10_135 problem has gone away.
  Thanks,

Had changed "Enhanced Real Time Clock" from module to built-in so next
itteration will change it back and check it out. In the meanwhile here's
a recap of what I've done:
Started with a Slackware 9.0 installation, booting kernel 2.4.xx.
Custom kernel, these (amoung others) are modules: lp, floppy, and
"Enhanced Real Time Clock". Have this line in fstab so can mount floppy
as user:
  /dev/fd0   /mnt/floppy   auto   noauto,user
Everything works as expected. Then kernel-2.6 came out. So I "cp /vmlinuz
/vmlinuz.4", changed lilo's first entry to lin6, adding 2nd entry lin4,
installed lilo, edited lilo.config to change the 2nd vmlinuz to vmlinuz.4
and recycled lilo.
