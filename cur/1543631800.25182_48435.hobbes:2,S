That looks like my patch.  It stops the oops (by fixing a signed
vs. unsigned comparison bug) but doesn't fix the colormap handling.
On my G4 powerbook, which has an ATI Rage 128 (Mobility M3 AGP 2x) the
screen colours are all totally wrong under X when I boot 2.5.18.  I
have Option "UseFBDev" in my /etc/X11/XF86Config-4, so the X server is
using the kernel frame buffer driver to do colormap updates.  (The
colours are all OK on the text consoles though.)
Paul.
