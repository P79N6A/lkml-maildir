Ok, it isn't listed (USR0009).  I'll send a patch.  BTW, there is some
other ID - /sys/devices/pnp1/01:01/card_id - and it contains USR0101.
What's this?

But why doesn't it find the two standard mb-embedded ports?  And why
they are found by 8250_pnp?  Is it a normal behaviour?

Ok.  I' trying.  The kernel is compiling...

Thanks.  But what about the incorrect info in /proc/tty/driver/serial?
