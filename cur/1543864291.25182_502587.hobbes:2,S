This is not what's going on.
The hypervisor does the PCI config space programming on the
device to setup the MSI so that it can be done in a controlled
manner and such that the device cannot ever be configured by
one domain to shoot MSI packets over at devices which belong
to another domain.
It's that simple.
That's absolutely reasonable, and is I believe what you'll see the
sparc64 hypervisor(s) all needing as well.
