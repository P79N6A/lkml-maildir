It seems that the test should be :
	if (nmi_watchdog == NMI_IO_APIC) {
		... disable it
	}
I don't think the perfctr watchdog would be affected by the code in
io_apic.c
(on a vaguely related note, booting with nmi_watchdog=2 on my SMP
machine gives high rates of nmis :
janus:~# cat /proc/interrupts | grep NMI ; sleep 1 ; cat /proc/interrupts | grep NMI
NMI:      88358      88358
NMI:      88432      88397
when the machine is compiling kernels. I dunno why ...)
