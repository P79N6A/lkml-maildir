No, you might end up waking someone who did the pthread_cond_wait()
after you did the pthread_cond_broadcast in place of one of the
existing pthread_cond_wait() threads.
I don't believe this is allowed.

Where?  Having done the inc, the futex_up at (a) will fall through,
giving the "thread behaves as if it [signal or broadcast] were issued
after the about-to-block thread has blocked."

You're talking about a completely different beast.
So the summary is: futexes not sufficient to implement pthreads
locking.  That's fine; I can drop all the "extension for pthreads"
futex patches and leave the code as-is ('cept the UP_FAIR patch, which
is independent of this debate).
Thanks!
Rusty.
