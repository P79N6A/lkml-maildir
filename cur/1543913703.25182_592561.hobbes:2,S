You might rename EXPORT_UNUSED_SYMBOL to EXPORT_UNUSED_SYMBOL_ADRIAN 
because AFAIK I am still the only person who was ever dumb enough to
use it after you wanted me to do so...
Everyone else is allowed to always add, remove and change exports
as he likes, but I should go through this special process.
It makes no sense (except for keeping me busy) to treat some patches I 
send special while changes made by other people that break the modules 
API are still allowed.
Andrew, please define API rules, IOW rules for addition, removal and 
changing of exported code, that are valid for *everyone* or go to hell 
with your EXPORT_UNUSED_SYMBOL.
