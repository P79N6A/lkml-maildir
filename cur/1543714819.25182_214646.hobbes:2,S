Subject: 2.6.6-rc1 caused dedicated Quake 3 server to core dump

For years now, I've been running a dedicated Quake 3 server on my linux
box.  Last night, was the first time I've ever seen a core dump with
Quake.  2.6.5 was and is now running fine, but under 2.6.6-rc1 it core
dumped within about 30 minutes with the attached dmesg output.  I am
also including my config's for 2.6.5 and 2.6.6-rc1.  The only things I'm
aware of as being different is CONFIG_POSIX_MQUEUE=y and the relabeling
of usbhid (2.6.6-rc1) from just hid (2.6.5).  If any additional
information is needed, please let me know.  Also, please CC as I'm no
longer on this mailing list.
Thanks,
Steve
