Hi Dave,
Here's a patch that fixes a modify-after-free bug in ip_conntrack which
was caught by the slab-debugging in 2.5
I've tried to get Harald to approve it and send it to you but I've been
unable to get any response from him for ~2 weeks, so here it is. He can
complain later and provide a diffrent fix if he doesn't like this one.
This patch fixes the case where a related connection terminates after
the connection that expected it has already terminated. In this case the
list_head of the already terminated (and free'd) connection were
modified and we might get invalid pointers in other expectations.
Andrew has had a slightly diffrent fix in -mm during this time. That
patch fixed the modify-after-free but still left invalid pointers in
expectations, this one doesn't.
Please apply to both 2.4 and 2.5
