Yes indeed. At the moment however I was just looking at something 
as simple as a single (or more) parameter to pass from an old 
kernel to the new one. That parameter could be a scalar value/
variable or denote the address of a control block, or something 
requiring more complicated interpretation like you mention.
If the parameter is a pointer to an address block right now the
code to put it in a place that doesn't get overwritten when the
new kernel loads is left as the responsibility of the caller.
Designing a generic and clean interface for that would require
more thought and is best delayed a bit till we understand all the
needs better. Mcore for example (as you probably know already)
passes a map of affected pages to the new kernel and during early 
bootmem initialization those pages (from the previous boot) are 
marked as reserved, instead of moving them to a contiguous memory 
area. Its just the start of the map (crash header) that's still 
passed in as a fixed location (rather its relative to the end of
the current image) and I was looking at a nice way to avoid that.
One way of course is to add a kernel parameter(s) and set this 
through user-space (after extracting it from the
kernel .. possibly via kmem) when loading the image (kexec tools
does all the work of filling up the parameter block). Probably
that's what was intended.
Eric, Is that correct ? BTW, did you have an option (or plan 
to add one) in kexec tools to use the current kernel's parameters 
and append additional options to it ?
