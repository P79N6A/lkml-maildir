The subject wasn't hardware fault tolerance. It was a desire for faster reboots
on a vanilla server. The correct answer to maximising up time in such a situation
is indeed to take care to avoid need for reboots - good power, good air con,
clean filters, tidy wiring, etc. Most people have a poor attitiude to these
things, but they can do far more to improve most people's up-time than a faster
fsck ever could. I've had a lot of bad experiences with ECC RAM *not* protecting
against failures (many designs are buggy), but I've had excellent experience with
a cool dust free machine room avoiding them. How can I know that I am avoiding
failures? Well, I just have to compare our failure rates with those of other with
similar hardware and poorly managed installations.
Start with the weakest link!
