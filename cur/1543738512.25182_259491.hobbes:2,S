Interesting.  I find that with suspend-to-ram, USB keyboards don't
work after resume, and that the system will hang on resume if you
remove a USB device during sleep.
Are you using suspend-to-ram or suspend-to-disk?

OK, how about we pass a struct that contains both the target system
power state and the target device power state?  That would fit in 32
bits.
For now (i.e. 2.6.9), could we have the following patch?  It only
affects suspend-to-disk, and it tells the drivers that we are going to
D3cold (4) when we are doing suspend-to-disk.
