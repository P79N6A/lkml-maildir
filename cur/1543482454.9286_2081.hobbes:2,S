It is correct if we limit the physical memory to 2 GB minus something on 
32 bits systems, and by the way it does a useless masking for i386 arch 
on remapped address.
So, it will be correct for me forever since I will never use that amount 
of memory on 32 bits Intel, but the useless masking as gone away from my 
systems since months.

I was aware of the care of having old drivers still working and I agree
that I should not have written this stuff was 'bogus'.
Btw, I have posted about this problem weeks (perhaps months) ago but 
nobody replied to my post.

I was not asking for this stuff to be changed in 2.2, but just suggesting 
some simple and quick changes to help users go beyond the 2 GB physical 
limit on 32 bit Intel if they really need or just want.
After all, everybody can implement his own patches for his personal use.
