You'll find that the existing ports that support multiple pci
domains do not number the busses on the secondary domains from
zero.  If domain 0 has 3 busses, then domain 1's root bus will
be bus number 3, and so on.
This approach works quite well in practice, even on machines
with large numbers of pci domains, since there tends to be no
pci-pci busses on domains other than the one containing legacy
i/o widgetry.
