Hmm, I thought that was the whole point of the different cpu type
choices in the kernel.  Then again the MTRR is still available with a
386 kernel on a newer cpu as far as I remember, so I guess I will try a
486 optimized kernel next.

That is the plan long term, although the BIOS's serial console doesn't
seem to work well with grub at least on minicom.  I think switching to
lilo may help that.

Even more reason to keep the video off (I think it steals some system
ram when on as well).

I have audio disabled since I have no need for it.

Only PCI and LPC devices in use, so I don't think I will be poking any
legacy registers directly, although I have no idea if the kernel would
be poking any of them as part of running the drivers.  Hopefully not.
Thanks for the information.
