Goodie. Are there other known problems with silly copy-protection 
schemes?  It migth be worth testing.

Yes. It seems I broke "strace" with it. Probably the difference in system
call trace reporting that Dan Jacobowitz already pointed out.
Now, that should be easily handled by just separating out the cases of 
system call tracing and debug trap handling, and using the old silly code 
for system calls. I'd prefer a cleaner approach, but that seems to be the 
sane thing to do for now.
