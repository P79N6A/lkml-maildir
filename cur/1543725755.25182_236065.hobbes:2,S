Oh ok, that makes much more sense now. "arch/kerne/cpu" is the

I think we agree.  So are there some existing docs that you/Ximian has 
on reccomended usage and object naming? I didn't see anything on 
freedesktop.org.  That's where a lot of my questions are coming from. We 
have this really simple events system, but how do we expect it to be used
in the kernel.
