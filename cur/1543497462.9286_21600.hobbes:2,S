Not needed, if the <linux/string.h> header is included whereever needed.
BTW, what is wrong with the builtins? I see claims that they generate
horrible code, but no substantiation... and even if so, I'd prefer to fix
the builtins than to kludge around them in the kernel...

Should _never_ happen with glibc-2.1, and if it happens you have bigger
trouble than that.
