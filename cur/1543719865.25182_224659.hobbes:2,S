IIRC, Lisp systems like CMUCL and SBCL (plus commercial Lisps) had
problems with FC1 due to execshield.  They tend to do things like
compile code on the fly to heap memory and expect to be able to run

Disclaimer: I don't hack on free Lisps; I just follow some of the
mailing lists, so I may have important details wrong.  :)
