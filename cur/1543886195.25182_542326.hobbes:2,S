Yup, done.

As Stefan, said, dma_map_sg() breaks the limit guarantee, so we have to split 
things manually if sg entries got merged.  I've added a comment explaining this.
Isn't max_sectors the overall size limit of the request, though?  The SBP-2 
protocol imposes a maximum size of 65535 bytes per sg entry, but the total 
size of a request can be larger.  I guess, setting dma_boundary to 2^15 could 
work.

Done.

Oh, hmm... I though the kernel style typically was to avoid excess parens :) 
But, sure, I see the comment about preferring parens with sizeof in CodingStyle.

That should simplify the code a bit.  How long has that been the case?

Ok, I've changed that.

Ok, I'll patch the scsi host template definition.

I was trying to be clever and only allocate the host once the device had been 
discovered and initialized.  I have now changed the code to just allocate the 
host up front and use the hostdata mechanism for the sbp2_device struct, which 
also addresses the host life cycle comments below.

Stefan addressed this one.

Now fixed as described above.
Thanks for the review, will send out new patches.
