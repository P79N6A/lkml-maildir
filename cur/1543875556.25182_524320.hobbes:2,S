We never want to _abort_ pending updates only pending reads. So, even with 
revoke(), we need to be careful which is why we do do_fsync() in 
generic_revoke_file() to make sure pending updates are flushed before we 
declare the inode revoked.
But, I haven't looked at forced unmount that much so there may be other 
issues I am not aware of.
