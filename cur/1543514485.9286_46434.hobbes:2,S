Hi,
PPSkit-0.8.1 should do for ntp-4.0.98b, but I could not test it (CVS
stopped working for me).
Here are the changes and other important information bits:
                            NEWS for 0.8.1
+ Updated ``BUGS'' and ``INSTALL''.
+ As I got no majority in the API working group to enforce setting the
  ``api_version'' to the proper value when using
  ``time_pps_setparams()'', I enforce it before the kernel is entered.
  This will fulfill what the draft says: ``This field is present to
  enable binary compatibility with future versions of the API.''
+ Avoid possible overflow situation when interpolating ticks using the
  timer chip's register in ``arch/i386/time.c''.
+ Updated ``enable_pps.c'' to fix some bugs when reporting events and
  times.  Changed format of output to show both sequence numbers.
  Added new option '-J' to monitor jitter only when a PPS or clock
  error is signalled.  Made event detection algorithm more reliable if
  both events are monitored.
