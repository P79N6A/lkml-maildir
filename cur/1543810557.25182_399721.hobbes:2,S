None of that matters or is relevant.
You took a kernel interface which was present in 2.6.10, 2.6.11, 2.6.12,
2.6.13, 2.6.14 and 2.6.15 and changed it in a non-compatible way, without
telling us that it was non-compatible and without even notifying people
that we'd gone and broken existing userspace.
We.  Don't.  Do. That.
Please either restore the old events so we can have a 6-12 month transition
period or revert the patch.
