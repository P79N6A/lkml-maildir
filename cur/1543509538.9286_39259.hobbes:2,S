My dual Pentium III system is up and running linux smp-kernel 2.2.3. The
motherboard used is an ASUS P2B-DF.  Trying to set the BIOS clock via
the /sbin/clock or the /sbin/hwclock
commands fail. As probable reason for this behaviour the syslog file is
full of entries like:
Sep 16 07:31:23 lxsrv2 kernel: set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 50 to 1
Sep 16 07:32:24 lxsrv2 kernel: set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 50 to 2
Sep 16 07:33:25 lxsrv2 kernel: set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 50 to 3
Sep 16 07:34:26 lxsrv2 kernel: set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 50 to 4
Also the entries in /proc/rtc are anomalous:
rtc_time        : 12:36:05
rtc_date        : 1997-01-01
rtc_epoch       : 1900
alarm           : **:**:57
DST_enable      : no
BCD             : yes
24hr            : yes
square_wave     : no
alarm_IRQ       : no
update_IRQ      : no
periodic_IRQ    : no
periodic_freq   : 1024
batt_status     : okay
Has anybody had similar problems? Any help would be appreciated.
Please let me know, if you need further information.
