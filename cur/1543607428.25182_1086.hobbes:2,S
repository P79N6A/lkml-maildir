We've been over this already, while it would be nice for testing if the
two VM's could be compared without all the extra variables of the Linus
and -ac trees it's not going to happen. It would be a big headache to 
maintain all the extra source that would involve and all the changes to 
other stuff you'd have to patch to make the two interchangeable. This 
has been discussed for almost a week now and I'm sure it will show up
in next weeks kernel-traffic. I'd encourage layperson's to wait till
then to see how this story continues. <announcer_voice> So until next
week dear viewers! Same bat-time, same bat-channel!</announcer_voice>
If you're interested in seeing some of the discussion, here's a
reasonable jump off point in the archives...

Just trying to better the signal-to-noise on linux-kernel...
