Some old notebooks forget them on, which makes the keyboard unusable -
you get '4' instead of 'u', etc.
We can't read the LED state anyway (except for going to the BIOS data
structures, which isn't reasonable from the atkbd driver), and we need
to initialize it, so off is the safer default.
Further, this has been the behavior of Linux since it was first
implemented, and thus, in my rewrite of the keyboard handling, I didn't
change it.
It's trivial to change the default lock state in init scripts / xdm
config / X config, too.
