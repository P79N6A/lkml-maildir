It's a winmodem, so this is off topic here. What you see in the
sources are things to identify it with lspci etc, not to make
it work.
Check
http://developer.intel.com/design/modems/support/drivers.htm
 .
Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. I own such a crap (as
a backup, because I have ADSL), actually, the 537, and Intel
doesn't even list drivers for my model (only for the 537EP),
but I could get them at
http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/Intel/537/
 . And yes,
there's no 2.6 support, another reason to stay away from such
winmodems.
