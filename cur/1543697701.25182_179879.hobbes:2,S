When did this change take place? It would be easy to test then. I did some
more tests on the weekend and found that this isn't RAID related; also
normal single disk access is much faster on the 2.4.20-ac's than on other
recent kernels. Just to summarise, the disk speed on one of the Athlon
XP's (2GHz, 1.5 GB RAM, 2*160 GB Maxtor 6Y080L0) according to bonnie++:
RAID-0		VIA	write	read
2.4.19		none	10,000	  9,000
2.4.20		3.35	73,000	 88,000
2.4.20-ac1	3.35-ac	70,000	135,000
2.4.20-ac2 	3.35-ac	71,000	140,000
2.4.21-pre1     3.35-ac 71,000	 79,000
2.4.21-pre3	3.35-ac 71,000	 79,000
2.4.23-rc3	3.37	65,000	 82,000
single disk
2.4.20-ac2	3.35-ac	55,000	 74,000
2.4.23-rc3	3.37	54,000	 48,000
So the single disk read performance of 2.4.20-ac2 is as fast as a
double RAID-0 array of other kernels.
Have a nice day,
