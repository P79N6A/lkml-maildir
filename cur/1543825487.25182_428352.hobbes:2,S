They are separate patch sets (and rc5-mm1 has David's without Peter's).
But they trample on nearby areas and share infrastructure, so I'm happy
that they're looked at together.  Peter has helpfully arranged his to
go on top of David's: that can be reversed later if it's decided that
Peter's is wanted but David's not.
