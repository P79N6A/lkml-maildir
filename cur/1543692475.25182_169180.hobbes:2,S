        /* Our write does not write to user space */
        write = (ssize_t (*)(struct file *, const char *, size_t, loff_t *))
                file->f_op->write;
lbt:
	For cases like this, where we use a kernel pointer and do the 
	"set_fs(KERNEL_DS)" thing to make a user-pointer routine write
	to kernel space, I suggest casting the pointer instead of
	the function, along with a comment on the "set_fs()".
		set_fs(KERNEL_DS);
		/* This cast is legal due to the set_fs()! */
		data = (const void __user *) addr;
		...->write(file, data, bytes);
		set_fs(old_fs);
	See? That makes the cast more obvious, and it also makes it obvious
	_why_ the cast from kernel->user pointer is ok in this case.
Hmm. Yes. Hmm.
I have to admit that my cast is complicated, one might even say messy,
but as always - when something seems messy it can be made to look
less so by using more lines of code. E.g.,
	write = (write_to_kernel_t) file->f_op->write;
looks less intimidating, and write_to_kernel_t can be defined next to
write_proc_t that we have already.
I think I prefer two rights above two wrongs - the declaration
already gives addr the right type - it really does point to kernel space -
but we inherit an incorrect type for file->f_op->write, so have to cast
that.
Hmm. In reality maybe I have no strong feelings either way.
Will see what you do and possibly send some other version
of what you did not apply.

[Soon things get more interesting. These were the trivial cases,
with set_fs nearby and to a constant value. In other words, cases
where we know precisely what happens and only have to add a cast.
Intermezzo has a lot of code where the same code may be executed
with kernel and with user pointers.
Sendfile can use kernel or user pointers. It is declared with __user
so requires
        retval = in_file->f_op->sendfile(in_file, ppos, count, file_send_actor,
                                         (void __user *) out_file);
(fs/read_write.c:585 -- two wrongs indeed) where the type of pointer
is implicit in the actor.  Struct tty_operations has the field
	int  (*write)(struct tty_struct *tty, int from_user,
		      const unsigned char *buf, int count);
Etc. Lots of places where static markup does not suffice to show
which pointers point to user space. Pity. That diminishes the value
of __user markup greatly.]
