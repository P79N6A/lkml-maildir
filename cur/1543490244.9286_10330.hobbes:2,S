...I had a router crash this morning, and fetchmail dropped some
connection for timeout. Now I have :
Active Internet connections (w/o servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State

This ones are here since this morning (it's about 10 hours) 
I supposed that after some time they would be forcibly closed. Server is 
pop3 daemon, I am not sure what machine but I think a SG (sendmail 
says IRIS 2.0). 
Linux 2.2.3 vanilla.
