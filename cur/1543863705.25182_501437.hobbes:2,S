These comments from me are before the hand merge I'm going to do tonight.

I fixed all of those I can find.

Removed. They are for annotation which isn't important right now.

Removed.

I reduced that all to a single space without using huge tabs.

I made this change.

Not sure what you mean here but I made the key comparison so that it would
treat each struct field in most to least significant order evaluation. The
old code worked fine. What you're seeing is the newer stuff.

I've made your suggested change, but I'm not done with it.

Done. I misinterpreted the style guide and have made the changes to
conform to it..

Done for all the instances I remember off hand.

I'm a bit of a space cadet so I might have missed something.
Latest patch here.

I'm going to review and hand merge your changes to the older patch tonight.
Thanks for the comments.
