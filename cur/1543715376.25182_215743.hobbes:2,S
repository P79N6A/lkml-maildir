smbfs and cifs does not share any code although I believe both of them
will send multiple requests in parallel. Any chance that this is the 
server or network?
smbfs at least does not limit the number of requests it sends. It could be
a problem if the server has a low limit (should be the maxmux field in the
smb_conn_opt struct).
I could send a patch for this, but unless cifs does the same then that is 
probably not it.
