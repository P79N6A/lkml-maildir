Actually. Looking around at the server side, there appear to be a
couple of potential problems too...
There don't seem to be any checks and balances to prevent the user
from removing the sunrpc module immediately after svc_create_thread()
gets called.
I presume that the call to lockd_up() in nfsd() will help (since that
calls rpciod_up() and hence MOD_INC_COUNT) but AFAICS there appears to
be plenty of possible races before we get to that point.
Cheers,
