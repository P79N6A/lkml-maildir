Subject: [PATCH 1/7] HPET: Fix mmap() of /dev/hpet
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The address passed to io_remap_pfn_range() in hpet_mmap() does not
need to be converted using __pa(): it is already a physical
address. This bug was found and the patch suggested by Clay Harris.
I introduced this particular bug when making io_remap_pfn_range
changes a few months ago. In fact mmap()ing /dev/hpet has *never*
previously worked: before my changes __pa() was being executed on an
ioremap()ed virtual address, which is also invalid.
