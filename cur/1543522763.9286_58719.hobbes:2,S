These may not be all the errors.  I haven't seen very many... many of
them didn't show up in the logs.  The chip lockup ones are from mpg123
-Z -s *.mpg > /dev/dsp1 (dsp is sb16 with standard kernel OSS), or at

Thank you for being interested in my report.  I hope you all will
impliment the wavetable midi asap.  Thank you for the great work.  It is
nice to have CLEAN sound.
