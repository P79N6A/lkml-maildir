I understand what you want to do. Page migration is meaningless if the
cost of it is high.

It's not hard to add "no-retry-mode" to "remap_onepage()" function
if you want. It may skip to migrate some pages if they are accessed
heavily. In paticular if you only want to care about anonymous pages,
they will be handled very well.
