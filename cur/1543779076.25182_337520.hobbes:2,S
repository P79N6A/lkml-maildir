Yes. The thing is, that to make the 2.6.13-rc4 work here, I have to either 
use this:

or the new Adaptec aacraid driver that uses the new comm. Since the latter 
is unlikely to make it into mainline before 2.6.13, the above patch 
should.
However I may add, that the 512 value was found to be the maximum 
acceptable for my configuration only (AAC 2410SA + 3xWD1200JD + 
1xWD1600SD). If there is anyone else out there having similar problems it 
would be nice if they tested the value. Perhaps for some other 
configurations the value would have to be even lower. (??)
So, from my POV the value should be set to at most 512 for the 2.6.13 and 
after 2.6.13 is out, the new driver should be pushed in before the next 
freeze.
