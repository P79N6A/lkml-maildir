| Hi everybody!

| I hope that i can steal enough of your precious time to get your
| attention for a new patch that adds hard real time support to the
| linux kernel (worst case interrupt response time below 5
| microseconds):
|
| The proposed "real time interrupt patch" enables the linux kernel
| for hard-real-time applications such as data aquisition and control
| loops by adding priorities to interrupts and spinlocks.
|
| The following document will describe the patch in detail and how to
| install it:
