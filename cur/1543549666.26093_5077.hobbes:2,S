Process 1,2 and 3 all start allocating 20 pages
      process 1 stalls after allocating 19
      some memory is freed and process 2 runs and stall after allocating 19
      some memory is free and process 3 runs and stalls after allocating 19
    now 57 pages are locked up in non-swapable kernel space and the system deadlocks OOM.

My point here is simply that error returns in memory allocation allow 
higher level kernel operations to safely marshal a collection of resources following
a safe algorithm that is optimized for the case when there is no memory shortage
and that only starts going to the slow case when the system is stalling due to memory
shortages anyways.
