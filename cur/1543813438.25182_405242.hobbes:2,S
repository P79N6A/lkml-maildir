Then why not just have a bunch of different files for the different
things, and then a simple shell script to grab them all and put them
together however you want.
The main issue is that if you create a sysfs file like this, and then in
3 months realize that you need to change one of those characters to
be something else, you are in big trouble...

Sure, lots of different files can be combined by a script into a whole.

Just because you don't want to use it doesn't mean it isn't the proper
tool...
