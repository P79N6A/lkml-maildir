There was a "threadgroup" added just before the 2.4 release.
Linus said he'd remove it if he didn't get comments on how
useful it was, examples of usage, etc. So I figured I'd look at
the code that weekend, but the patch was removed before then!
There is nothing that ps and top can do about this problem.
I've certainly looked into the matter; much of the code is mine.
BTW, the version in debian-unstable is the most stable. :-)
These options might help a little bit: --forest -H f

How about a filesystem filter to spit out patches, or a filesystem
interface to version control?
