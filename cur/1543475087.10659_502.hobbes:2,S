Try 1/7th, or 21% (at least based on your figures)...

Obviously you don't have to pay for your time connected to the
Internet! I do, as do most others in the UK and several other
countries!!!
That may only be 1/8th denser, but it's 300 Megs and that equates to
quite a few lumps of brass...
Also, try comparing individual tarballs: The latest kernel tarball
shows as follows:
		gz	12.4 MB
		bz2	10.0 MB
That makes the gz tarball 24% larger than the bz2 one, and even at 56k
Baud, downloading an extra 2.4 MB costs money...

What's the access rate to ftp.funet.fi from sites that have to pay for
their connections?

Best wishes from Riley.
