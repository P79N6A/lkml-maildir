Leonard,
please try booting with pci=noacpi -- if that causes the box to work,
then you have an ACPI interrupt configuration problem.  If it doesn't,
try booting with "acpi=off" to confirm that it functions properly with
ACPI completely out of the picture.
also, the acpi developers are actually at
acpi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.
thanks,
