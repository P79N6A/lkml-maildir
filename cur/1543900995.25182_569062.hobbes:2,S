I see, the acessor is abstracted via a function.
That seems pointless, and allows you to do things like this, improving
the implementation on one set of platforms yet leave others using
SMT/multi-core scheduling behind.
It makes a lot more sense to make the implementation consistent
and therefore the improvements are seen on every platform.
