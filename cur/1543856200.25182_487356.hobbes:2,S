If you read John David Anglin's email, you'll note that if you take the 
address you need this function provided somewhere.
Which of the functions my patch changes also have a global function 
provided within the kernel?
If none, "extern inline" didn't make any sense.

Currently, "inline" is defined to be always_inline, and 
__always_inline is for cases that produce non-compiling or non-working 
(opposed to only suboptimal) code.
