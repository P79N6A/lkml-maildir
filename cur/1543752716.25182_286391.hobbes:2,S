Subject: timer problems on 2.6.x on IBM x306 servers

I have had multiple IBM x306 servers loose interrupts.  Eventually the
timer will get a few interrupts, but it can stay at the same spot for a
long time.
If I reboot, and then add append=noapic in lilo and reboot again I never
get a problem in the future.
One of the boxes I have has a third NIC and if I use noapic the machine
cannot boot.  Is there something besides noapic I should try.
Is there any other information you would like?
