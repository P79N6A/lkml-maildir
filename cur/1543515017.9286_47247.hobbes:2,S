Doh.  I forgot how unsigned math works.  
It doesn't matter if the tsc wraps after setting last_tsc_low.  The
subtraction, eax -= last_tsc_low, will still yield the right result.
As long as the tsc wrap hasn't occurred more than once.  That could
only happen if the timer interrupt didn't run for 2^32 cycles (about
10s on my machine).
