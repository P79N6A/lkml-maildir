This doesn't make a lot of sense, as..
1. the dmi_scan changes shouldn't apply to your system unless you've
   found a way to crowbar a 6x86 into a board with a l440GX chipset.
2. The Athlon SSE support is in an Athlon only path, so that never gets
   run on your box
3. The P4 HT support is in CONFIG_SMP ifdefs, so never even got compiled
   in.  Likewise the smpboot.c changes.
*stumped*.
Can you rebuild from a clean tarball, patch straight up to pre5
and try and reproduce this ? I'm betting it won't happen and you had
some cruft from an old build making things go awry.
Dave.
