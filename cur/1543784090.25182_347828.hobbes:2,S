The only other user of proto_list besides proto_register, which
doesn't care, are the seqfs functions. They use the slab pointer,
but in a harmless way:
                    proto->slab == NULL ? "no" : "yes",
Anyway, I've moved it up to the top.
[NET]: proto_unregister: fix sleeping while atomic
proto_unregister holds a lock while calling kmem_cache_destroy, which can
sleep.
Noticed by Daniele Orlandi <daniele@orlandi.com>.
