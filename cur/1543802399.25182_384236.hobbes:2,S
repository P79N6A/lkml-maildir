Doing every call through some lib even if it's only a wrapper leading
to kernel syscall doesn't look very interesting.
Some people need statically lined apps and minimum usable distro without
bloated libs. What about Unix device abstraction?
Are we going the current Windows way?
Anyway Windows is stearing to the microkernel approach (approaching Vista)
and it looks that we are going to the current Windows model while MS  
developers
are going far away. Hurd looks nice but it is not good enough now.
But the idea is good and needs more people to improve it.
So we could have Unix device approach with drivers running as separate  
processes
not in kernel space. With proper kernel scheduling and being non-swappable
we could get good security, stability and additionally enough simple
 from app point of view approach. Going through libs we are going through
all the LD_PRELOAD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH and linker security hell.
Kernel approach looks good enough for me now. But it is not so secure of  
course.
So we need some process->kernel-device->driver RT/non-swappable/correctly
scheduled process IPC so we can do it the other way. IMHO that's the future
if we don't want drivers in the kernel.
Best regards
