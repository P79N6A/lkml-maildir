Right you are.  I only avoided the checksum calculation, which is hardly
worth it for modern processors even though the NIC will do it for you.
One could further argue that TCP is not the protocol of choice if
you're looking to minimize transfer latency.  There's still the receive
path to worry about, for instance.
