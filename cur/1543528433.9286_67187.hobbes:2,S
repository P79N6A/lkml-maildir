kmap() assumes that a "struct page" exists.
It's not guaranteed that a "struct page" exists for reserved memory:
this could happen if you boot with "mem=32M", or if the ACPI tables are
the last element in the e820 map:
* max_pfn is set to the end if the last usable block.
* then the ACPI tables follow --> they are behind max_pfn --> behind the
end of mem_map.
Not everyone has 8 GB memory :-(
