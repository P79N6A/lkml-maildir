Oh!  I realised why we're mis-communicating.
I started in the assumption that you're using POLLRDHUP to trigger a
second read, but you're using it in a different way (makes sense given
the name!)
You're assuming that a short read is always the last one with data,
that's the read() trick, and detecting EOF is really a wholly separate
problem.
Ah..
First let's get the misc bits out of the way.

Look at the line "if (copied >= target)" in tcp_recvmsg.

Normal behaviour is for urgent data to be discarded, I believe.  Now
if someone sends it to you, you'll end up with the socket stalling
with pending data in the buffers.  Not saying whether you care, it's
just a difference of behaviour to be noted and a potential DOS
(filling socket buffers which app doesn't know to empty).
Now on to the important stuff.

I disagree - inside a stream parser callback (e.g. XML transcoder) I
prefer to _not_ know the difference between pipe, file, tty and socket
that I am reading.

Stream fds provided you don't hit the unusual cases.
Point taken.  Now I'm saying there's an interface which is no more or
less complicated, but _doesn't_ require you to treat different kinds
of fds differently.  So I can write code which uses the read() trick
universally without having to pass that extra parameter,
EOF_SETS_RDHUP, to the event callback :)

Quite.  When you write an app that uses it and the read(2) trick
you'll see the bug which Eric brought up :)
I'm saying there's a way to write an app which can use the read(2)
trick, yet which does _not_ hang on older kernels.  Hence is robust.
My overall philosophy on this:
    The less object A needs to know about object B, the better, right?
Right? :)
