Playing with this sort of alignment is not the way to go in my opinion.
There are lots of subleties in hardware optimizations we probably never
will know about. The difference may be due, for example, to some subtle 
hashing that takes into account some other bits.
A strong alignment may allow the Bogo Mips result to be more deterministic
among kernel actual map, but no need to have such a deterministic Bogo
Mips result for udelay() to be accurate. It is the __delay() loop that
must behave consistenly for udelay() to be fine.

I donnot have an Alpha machine. I just based my postings on problems
reported to me. By the way, I am currently expecting some result with
__delay() as a true function, but this will be tried after the week-end.
