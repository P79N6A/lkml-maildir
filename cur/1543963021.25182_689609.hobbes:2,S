s/modes/model/ but, as far as I'm aware, works fine other than that. When I boot
with CONFIG_X86_PAT after applying that, I see:
	x86 PAT enabled: cpu 0, old 0x7040600070406, new 0x7010600070106
and PAT is retained in the feature flags. However, this I do not consider very
surprising. Why is this code doing what it is doing in the first place?
These feature flags are read from hardware in the CPUID instruction. Why is this code
then going "ah, this CPU may _claim_ PAT but we won't actually believe it unless it's
model foo, bar or baz". Is that feature flag buggy?
That is, why is the attached not the better fix? Works fine for me as well and will
retain the PAT feature flag also for for example the AMD family 6, model 1 and model
4 that both also advertise PAT in their feature flags, but wil have lost them now as
well in the same way.
If for some or other reason this explicit PAT white listing is in fact necessary, in
addition to the above, it seems you also need/want the same in generic_identify() in
that same file.
And what it definitely wanted was a changelog...
Rene.
