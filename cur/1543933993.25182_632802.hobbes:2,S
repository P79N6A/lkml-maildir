For MemoryStick Pro on my TI7421 card reader (since my old MemoryStick card 
and camera have disappeared somewhere, so I cannot currently test that):
Tested-by: Carlos Corbacho <carlos@strangeworlds.co.uk>
However, my only concerns are that:
1) tifm_ms was not autoloaded
2) On loading tifm_ms, only memstick was autoloaded - mspro_block was not.
Although, whether this is an issue with userspace (ie. udev) not dealing with 
the modules properly, I don't know.

File names in comments are now frowned upon - there was a thread on this in 
October on LKML:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/12/524
Also, before Andrew gets in with this - you should run this through 
checkpatch, as there are a few errors it throws up (mostly foo* and C99 
comments).
