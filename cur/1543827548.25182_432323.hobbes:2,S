No kidding.  Okay, it is also now failing for me with 2.6.16.18.
BUT.. with exactly that same binary kernel, it worked fine
not long ago --> but I've swapped out userland since then,
upgrading from Breezy to Dapper.  So something userland in Dapper
is triggering this failure, in a way that Breezy never did before.
This device has been quite usable until now (the upgrade to Dapper).

MMm.. yes, that makes some sense.  I have a pl2303 standalone that works fine,
but the one integrated into the 1.1 hub/dock is the one that fails.
If I plug the 1.1 hub/dock into another external hub, no problems.

Okay, I'll hunt for that.  Do you know of the exact patch?
Thanks
