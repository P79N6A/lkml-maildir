Someone needs ping Novell about patent  6,728,959 for SMP Strong 
Affinity and get it added to the patent commons project at OSDL.  It 
will help defeat  any claims brought by that certain Lindon Utah company 
owning SMP in Linux.   I noticed Novell has signed up but not placed any 
patents into the project.  Just thought I'd remind folks.  Linux uses 
strong affinity in much of its architecture.  Having that patent in the 
commons will remove any claims that Linux SMP infringes Unix.
