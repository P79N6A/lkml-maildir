Yep - although I put the dependancy into the line above. I had a patch, and 
was going to send it yesterday, but I only noticed that it was still in my outbox _after_ I'd disconnected... I noticed this when playing with the win95 bug
stuff in smbfs. 
Note that the reason I was doing this was because the help fails to mention
that CONFIG_SMB_95 has side effects when used on NT. 
Documentation/filesystems/smbfs.txt states this, but it should be in 
Configure.help as well. I'd do a patch, but I'm not sure if this option is
safe WRT win98. Anyone?
