It clearly says there that the driver is for 2.6.20. The changes needed for 2.6.21 are actually
very small (couple of fields in the mmc layer were renamed).
In general, it is impossible to maintain out-of-tree driver in sync with kernel tree - too many
changes are committed into it. The -mm version obviously fits its tree.
