How did you get the SysRQ-P output?
Didn't it lock up "hard"?
I use a similar kernel for several weeks and it lock up "hard" during "make 
zlilo" (always) or "make bzImage" (from time to time) ;-(
I have to-do several sync commands form another shell to build a bootable 
kernel. But "make modules modules_install" works always smooth.
No hangs during "normal" use.
Latest kernel is:
Linux version 2.4.18-pre8-K3-VM-24-preempt-lock (root@SunWave1) (gcc version 
2.95.3 20010315 (SuSE)) #1 Mit Feb 13 23:15:44 CET 2002
plus
waitq-2.4.17-mainline-1
bootmem-2.4.17-pre6
read-latency-2
latest ReiserFS stuff
