Following are the kexec patches which modify the concerned area and 
are _not_ under CONFIG_KEXEC. So it is also important to test such 
codepath with and without CONFIG_KEXEC. We have been testing various 
x86 machines with these patches and so far we have not observed any 
problems related to machine shutdown or APIC/IOAPIC shutdown.
x86-rename-apic_mode_exint.patch
x86-local-apic-fix.patch
x86-i8259-shutdown.patch
x86_64-i8259-shutdown.patch
x86-apic-virtwire-on-shutdown.patch
x86_64-apic-virtwire-on-shutdown.patch
x86-machine_shutdown.patch
x86_64-machine_shutdown.patch

Following are the links to kdump testing results and kexec-tools patches

At this point of time we have device initialisation problem in hand which
causes intermittent failures in second kernel boot in case of kexec-on-panic.

That's right. After the kexec rework, significant chunk of kdump 
functionality particularly related to panic codepath, which halts 
other CPU's and saves register states, is merged with kexec, as 
kexec-on-panic functionality.
kdump code in kernel is mainly reduced to dump capturing functionality 
only. If kexec-on-panic can successfully boot second kernel, there are 
remote chances of /proc/vmcore or /dev/oldmem not getting generated.
