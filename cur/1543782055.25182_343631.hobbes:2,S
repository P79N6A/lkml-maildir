Having an abstraction layer for a single client driver does seem a bit
pointless.  It would become more pointful if other client drivers were to
pop up.
Hence an option would be to merge an IOC4-specific driver which just does
what you need, no abstraction layer.  If someone later comes up with a
requirement for a driver for similar-looking hardware then we can resurrect
the abstraction layer at that stage.
