Involves taking up precious CD space with the DM tools and modules...
Besides, this isn't really the point, the point is that the new dmcrypto
is only in -mm and cryptoloop is in both trees, those of us developing
applications based on cryptoloop don't have a mainline kernel to even
start testing dmcrypto against in the 2.6 series, so it is more a
political issue than a technical issue which makes the removal of a
feature like this from the 2.6 series a bad thing...  (In my humble
never contributed to the kernel opinion)
Technically speaking there is no doubt that you are correct to want to
remove cryptoloop... but if people are depending on that support to stay
in a stable kernel and are developing based on it and don't have the
time to learn dm or dmcrypto and redesign whatever may need redesigning
to use it, it strikes me as rude to pull that support.

DEPRECATED would probably do...
