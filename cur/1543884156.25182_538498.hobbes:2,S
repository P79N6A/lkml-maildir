Why would we need to go back to SLAB if we have not switched to SLUB? SLUB 
is marked experimental and not the default.
The only problems that I am aware of is(or was) the issue with arches 
modifying page struct fields of slab pages that SLUB needs for its own 
operations. And I thought it was all fixed since the powerpc guys were 
quiet and the patch was in for i386.
