If you have 100% CPU load, you don't do background zeroing and you
fallback to old zero-after-alloc.
Background zeroing would help in applications that don't consume 100% CPU
all the time but need to be fast (interactive programs, internet or
database servers etc.).
It would also help a bit when system is under i/o load.
I don't see a big problem in rescheduling. Idle task can clear only a part
of page and check for the need to reschedule.
Processor cache can be disabled (I hope).
The whole idea is that if CPU has nothing to do, it could do something
useful. Why not?
