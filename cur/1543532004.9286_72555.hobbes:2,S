I've been searching around and I've seen one or two questions about
excessive context switching but I've yet to see any response to queries
regarding what level of switching should be expected.
Here are my details:
Pentium III 550 w/ 512kb Cache
RedHat 6.1 running the 2.2.12-20smp stock kernel
MySql 3.22
Apache running with JServ
I can give more details if necessary.
I'm seeing 'vmstat 1' output that looks like this:
   procs                      memory    swap          io    
system         cpu
 r  b  w   swpd   free   buff  cache  si  so    bi    bo   in    cs  us

Under moderate load I often see cs go as high as 500000. That seems like
quite a lot.
should I be worried about this or is this normal due to mysql threading
and jserv's jvms running?
or am I a fool and I should be running a newer kernel which clears all
this up.
thanks,
