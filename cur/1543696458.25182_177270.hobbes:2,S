This is a bit problematic, unfortunately... There really is no good way
to do this, the best you can do is approximate.

My suggestion would be to do page allocations (not kmalloc()). With kmap
that'll work just fine for you, and it's easy to extend to just use the
right gfp mask if/when we ever get something that works for this.
