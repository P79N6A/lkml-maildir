I'm very well aware of that ;-) But what you wrote was:

Or did you mean "after" instead of "without" ? Or maybe "into
equilibrium" instead of "the window open ..." ? (After all, the
window isn't only open, but it's been blown off its hinges.)
In any case, your statement accurately describes a somewhat
surprising quirk in Linux TCP performance as of only a bit more
than six years ago :)
