I have just spent a very frustrating evening trying to get console on USB 
working.  My laptop does not have regular DB-9 serial connectors, only 
USB.  So I ordered a USB to serial converter, configured a 2.6.0-test3 
kernel, added a console=/dev/ttyUSB0 to the kernel command line and 
connected this to my desktop with a null modem adapter.  However, I am 
unable to get output from this setup on the desktop.  On another setup I 
can get a normal serial console output, so I am fairly confident I can set 
things up correctly.
Googling around and doing a search on lkml archives gave some minimal 
help, but I can find very little info past early to mid 2.5 kernels.  The 
configuration doesn't quite seem to work the way I read documentation.  
For instance, the web pages I can find indicate I should be able to build 
this modular; however the configuration makes the setting of console on 
usb depend on USB being y and EXPERIMENTAL being defined.  
In /var/log/messages I can see the USB-to-serial converter being recogized 
and the driver being loaded, just before the synaptics touchpad is probed.
It looks like things are correct, but, as I said, I am unable to get 
output.  Am I headed for frustration, or is there some advice to get good 
results?  
Is there any advice I might be able to use to get this going?  I really 
want to be able to catch some oops output.
