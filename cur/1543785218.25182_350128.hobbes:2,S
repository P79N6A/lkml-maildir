Agreed the dst changes are ugly; that can be worked on.  But the 
cacheline bouncing problem on the atomic_t dst_entry refcounter has been 
around for quite a while -- even on SMPs, not just NUMA.  We need a solution 
for that.  I thought you were against the dst_entry bloat caused by the 
previous version of the dst patch.  alloc_percpu takes that away.  You had
concerns about workloads with low route locality. Unfortunately we don't have
access to infrastructure setup for such tests :( 
As for the ugliness, would something on the lines of net_device refcounter 
patch in the series above be acceptable?
Thanks,
Kiran
