It seems the patch got lost, I've updated it a bit and resent it to Andrew.
But: I think there is the potential for an even larger cleanup, although 
this would be more a rewrite:
Get rid of rcu_check_quiescent_state and instead use something like this 
in rcu_qsctr_inc:
static inline void rcu_qsctr_inc(int cpu)
{
        struct rcu_data *rdp = &per_cpu(rcu_data, cpu);
        if (rdp->quiescbatch != rcp->cur) {
             /* a new grace period is running. And we are at a quiescent
              * point, so complete it
              */
             spin_lock(&rsp->lock);
             rdp->quiescbatch = rcp->cur;
             cpu_quiet(rdp->cpu, rcp, rsp);
            spin_unlock(&rsp->lock);
     }
}
It's just an idea, it needs testing on big systems - does reading from 
the global rcp from every schedule call cause any problems? The cache 
line is virtually read-only, so it shouldn't cause trashing, but who knows?
