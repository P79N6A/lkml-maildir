Subject: apic errors and looping with 2.4, none with 2.2

I have one machine that won't run 2.4.  As soon as a 2.4 kernel boots, it
starts throwing APIC errors.
The machine is a dual CPU pIII 933MHz system with 512Mb ram on a
SuperMicro motherboard, either a P3TDLR or a 370DLR, with the ServerWorks
LE chipset.  I'm booting using lilo with append="noapic".
As soon as I boot into a 2.4 kernel, I start getting APIC errors on both
CPUs.  Varying combinations of:

Mar 23 00:40:45 dahlia kernel: APIC error on CPU1: 01(08)
Mar 23 00:45:45 dahlia kernel: APIC error on CPU1: 08(08)

Mar 23 00:58:27 dahlia kernel: APIC error on CPU0: 08(01)

Mar 23 01:11:04 dahlia kernel: APIC error on CPU1: 02(02)
Mar 23 01:11:04 dahlia kernel: APIC error on CPU0: 02(0a)
Mar 23 01:11:04 dahlia kernel: APIC error on CPU1: 02(08)
Mar 23 01:25:45 dahlia kernel: APIC error on CPU1: 08(08)
Mar 23 01:25:45 dahlia kernel: APIC error on CPU0: 0a(08)
After a few hours of uptime, the box stops responding to keyboard input.
It begins printing the above messages to console over and over.  I have
several other identical machines that I received in the same batch that
run 2.4 without any problems (though they do seem to require "noapic").
It runs fine with 2.2 and is running 2.2.26 right now.
The machine is not in production use and can be used to test.  Any ideas
for what I should look at?
