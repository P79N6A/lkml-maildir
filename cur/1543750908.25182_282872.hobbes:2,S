I've had this problem with many mailing lists not based in the UK, so
presumably that particular stupidity doesn't apply to them.  However
sad the case of the arm lists, I'd like to know if there are more
basic problems involved that could explain my experience.
It sounds like it would be an excellent idea not to host lists in the
UK though...
