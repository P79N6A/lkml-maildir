That could work, although it may be better to make it more generic and 
capable of handling any form of data. 
Any form of persistent storage would do - and if it can be handled entirely
in userspace, all the better. I merely pointed out that Keith's 
inter_module_xxx could provide this quite cleanly. Others disputed that it 
was required at all.
