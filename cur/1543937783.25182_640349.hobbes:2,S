Right, and this is consistent with other complaints about the PFN of the
page mattering to some hardware.
> c) dual/triple stream are not affected by your patch and are improved over 2.6.19
I am not very surprised. The callers to the page allocator are probably
making no special effort to get a batch of pages in PFN-order. They are just
assuming that subsequent calls give contiguous pages. With two or more
threads involved, there will not be a correlation between physical pages
and what is on disk any more.

I don't have enough experience with LVM setups to make an intelligent

Performance issue only. There are no data integrity concerns with that
patch.

That is certainly an option.
