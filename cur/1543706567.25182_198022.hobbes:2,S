No, it doesn't store the counter with the id.  They expect you to do that.
My best understanding is that thi sis to prevent re-use of the same key.
I'm not sure I grok why it is useful.  If you release a key, it should be
safe to reuse.  Period.  I assume there was some use case that brought about
this "feature" but if so, I don't know what it is.  The big comment about it
is just confusing me.
