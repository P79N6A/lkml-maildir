True, but we frequently update the tree at an interval of HZ/4.
Updating at every page fault sounded like an overkill and building the
entire tree at reclaim is an overkill too.

We don't have elements below their soft limit in the tree

We do remove the tree if it goes under its soft limit at commit_charge,
I thought I had the same code in uncharge(), but clearly that is
missing. Thanks, I'll add it there.
