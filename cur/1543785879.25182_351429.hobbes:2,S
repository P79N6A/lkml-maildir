You don't need a marker for all text files, but it's legal to have a marker
for utf-8 text files (see the uniocode standard 4.0.0 section 15.9), and
it's handy to use it until you made everybody in the world convert
everything to utf-8 (but not utf-{16,32}{le,be}).

If utf-8 encoded text files are text files, and text files are scripts,
and all of them shall have the same features, utf-8 encoded text files
with BOM MUST be recognized as legal scripts, too. Therefore this patch
fixes a kernel bug.
BTW: Implementing the other utf signatures from Table 15.3 is left to the
reader as an exercise.-)

If all text files are script files, execute this mail.

How exactly does it break, and what is it? And why must *it* be prevented
from breaking by ignoring script signatures in valid text files?

If your tools can't print utf-8 encoded characters, they are broken for
ISO-8859-*, too. Besides that, it's not a kernel problem.

Like e.g. the "From "-line starting each message in a mbox file? Virtually
no email client will display it. The size of email messages does differ
from it's unencoded content size, too! Off cause nobody can handle this,
and all users contantly try to kill themselfes because of that - NOT.
