According to arch/ia64/Kconfig, PCI support is optional on ia64.
Either arch/ia64/Kconfig should be fixed or the PCI=n builds must be 
fixed on ia64.
Looking closer, is the problem you are talking about caused by the fact 
that IA64_GENERIC select's options without ensuring that the 
dependencies of what it is select'ing are fulfilled?
