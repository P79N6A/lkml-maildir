Thanks for noticing - I had really this doubt when writing some code (in the 
patch, I've added a dirty PTEs on read accesses because I was unsure, and 
even because of my warning).

No, just replace pte_write() with is_write, as below. They might not coincide, 
but if on a write fault we return with a clean PTE, we'll loop indefinitely 
(experienced while hacking on remap_f_p), so the warning above is definitely 
correct.
       WARN_ON(!pte_young(*pte) || is_write && !pte_dirty(*pte));

Inform me of my mistakes, so I can keep imitating Homer Simpson's "Doh!".
