hm. When there are threaded interrupts, we quite naturally have to 
synchronize via scheduling, in synchronize_irq() - the interrupt we are 
waiting on might be scheduled away!

that's not good enough, we must not schedule with the preempt_count()

one solution would be to forbid disable_irq() from softirq contexts, and 
to convert the vortex timeout function to a workqueue and use the 
*_delayed_work() APIs to drive it - and cross fingers there's not many 
places to fix.
another solution would be to make softirqs preemptible if they are 
threaded. I'm a bit uneasy about that though. In that case we'd also 
have to make HARDIRQ threading dependent on softirq threading, in the 
Kconfig.
