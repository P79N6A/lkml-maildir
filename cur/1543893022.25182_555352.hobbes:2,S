Subject: [PATCH 2/3] cpuset: zero malloc - revert the old cpuset fix

Second of three -- This one undoes the first one.  Apply before
the container patch that changes cpusets to use containers,
in order to avoid a patch conflict.
The cpuset code to present a list of tasks using a cpuset to
user space could write to an array that it had kmalloc'd,
after a kmalloc request of zero size.
The problem was that the code didn't check for writes past
the allocated end of the array until -after- the first write.
This is a race condition that is likely rare -- it would only
show up if a cpuset went from being empty to having a task
in it, during the brief time between the allocation and the
first write.
Prior to roughly 2.6.22 kernels, this was also a benign
problem, because a zero kmalloc returned a few usable bytes
anyway, and no harm was done with the bogus write.
With the 2.6.22 kernel changes to make issue a warning if
code tries to write to the location returned from a zero
size allocation, this problem is no longer benign.  This
cpuset code would occassionally trigger that warning.
The fix is trivial -- check before storing into the array,
not after, whether the array is big enough to hold the store.

Andrew,
This is the second of three in the set - it reverses the
first one, to avoid colliding with the container patches.
Apply somewhere before, or entirely merge into:
