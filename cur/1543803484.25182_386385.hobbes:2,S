The kernelrelease depends on the actual configuration.
So without having completed the make *config step kbuild cannot tell the
correct kernelrelease.
Now with the patch attached to last mail kbuild will now error out in
case there is no valid kernelrelease. Thats obviously only a hack, since
we need to error out when .config has been updated and the new
kernelrelease has not been created.
Maybe the better approach would be always to create the .kernelrelease
file as part of the configuration - based on the principle of least
suprise.
See attached patch.
