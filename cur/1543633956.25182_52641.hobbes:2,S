Hi!
While trying to compile 2.4.19 the following error occurs:
pcilynx.c: In function `mem_open':
pcilynx.c:647: `num_of_cards' undeclared (first use in this function)
pcilynx.c:647: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
pcilynx.c:647: for each function it appears in.)
pcilynx.c:647: `cards' undeclared (first use in this function)
pcilynx.c: In function `aux_poll':
pcilynx.c:706: `cards' undeclared (first use in this function)
Relevant config options seem to me:
CONFIG_IEEE1394_PCILYNX=m
CONFIG_IEEE1394_PCILYNX_LOCALRAM=y
CONFIG_IEEE1394_PCILYNX_PORTS=y
Cheers,
Rolf
