No, I don't. I don't at all. But I prefer a more pragmatic approach to
the developers and companies who don't.
And yes, there _is_ IMHO a difference in telling someone on LKM,
especially someone without deeper knowledge that is lookin for help:
"You're using a non-open source driver, so we can't help you. Please
ask your vendor for support."
and
"Fuck off, <insert binary vendor, software or distribution> Luser".

expression).
