The legacy mode splits a tasks vm into an area for heap, mmaps, and stack
at fixed points.  Notably, mmap space started at 0x40000000, and new
mappings were searched from there scanning upward.  While stack grew
down into that area and heap grew up into that area.
The non-legacy (flexmmap) approach, starts looking for mmap space just
below the largest possible (rlimit) stack size and scans downward.  This
gives the most possible space to either brk or mmap heavy applications,
since the space doesn't start off as fragmented.
