        Once again, subject sez it all. CONFIG_SOFT_WATCHDOG is mentioned in 
drivers/char/Config.help, but is not a configurable option in any part of make 
{old,x,menu}config. Therefore isn't compiled or even touched:
bradl@bellicha:/usr/src/linux/drivers/char> grep CONFIG_SOFT_WATCHDOG Config.in
bradl@bellicha:/usr/src/linux/drivers/char> 
        Because of this, my software watchdog program refuses to run, as 
softdog.o doesn't exist, which creates /dev/watchdog.
                                                        BL.
