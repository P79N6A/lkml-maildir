Hey,
Just wanted people to know that the same problem I reported about 2.4.4 a
while back is still present in 2.4.6-pre6 (hard crash when doing "cat
whatever > /dev/dsp1" where /dev/dsp1 is an external USB audio device, where
"hard crash" means a freeze followed by "wait on irq" message as reported
earlier).
I have tracked down the problem to having appeared between 2.4.3 and 2.4.4
and occuring only on kernels compiled SMP (actual number of processors
doesn't matter), but the only response I have got is "no major changes
occured between those kernel versions" and I am not competent to find it
myself. :(
Any help appreciated...
