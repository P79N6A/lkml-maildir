Andrew,
Here is the changelog and signed-off-by for this patch. Of course I will
follow the SubmittingPatches guideline for future patches, sorry for not
doing it for that patch. 
I don't send this mail in the recommended form because the patch is
already added to the mm tree and I want to avoid a duplicate (or does it
not happen?).

[PATCH] gdth: remove the scsi_request interface from the gdth driver
From: Achim Leubner <Achim_Leubner@adaptec.com>
I removed all scsi_allocate_request()/scsi_release_request() calls and
all scsi_request structures from the driver and I replaced scsi_do_req()
call with a direct call to gdth_queuecommand() to send the request.
Furthermore I made some changes to preserve compatibility to the 2.4.x
kernels.
Signed-off-by: Achim Leubner <Achim_Leubner@adaptec.com>

Thanks,
Achim
