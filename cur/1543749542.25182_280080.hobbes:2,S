Yep! I just compiled my system without SMP and I was able to start up X
with NVidia on my HT laptop (with V0.7.33-04).  
Ingo, do you think this is a bug with NVidia (bad proprietary module) or
might be with something in the RT SMP side? I'll look a little more on
Monday, but if you know of something, let me know.  I'm curious to why
it works fine without RT but will not work with RT (and SMP). I
shouldn't say NVidia bug, since it only is a problem with the RT SMP, so
I should say incompatibility w.r.t. RT SMP and NVidia.
If you are one of those that don't want anything to do with the NVidia
driver, and don't care less if it works or not, let me know that too.
That way I won't bother you with this anymore and will only communicate
with Valdis :-)
Thanks,
-- Steve
