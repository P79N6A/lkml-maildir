I guess we should only use page_cache_release() if the page is known to be
pagecache.  In the case of get_user_pages() the page could of course be
anonymous in which case put_page is probably more appropriate.  It's all a
bit of a mess and if we ever do end up having PAGE_CACHE_SIZE > PAGE_SIZE,
someone will have some work to do.
I suppose put_page() would be better for now.

no...  You should only dirty the page if it was modified, and then use
set_page_dirty() or set_page_dirty_lock().
See dio_bio_complete() for an example.
