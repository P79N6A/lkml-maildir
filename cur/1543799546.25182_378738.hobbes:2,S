Hi , all !
Could anyone please clarify one thing in that old well known
wait_event_... code (taken from 2.6.5 wait.h ):
#define __wait_event_interruptible(wq, condition, ret)          \
do {                                                                    \
        wait_queue_t __wait;                                     \
        init_waitqueue_entry(&__wait, current);           \
                                                                        \
        add_wait_queue(&wq, &__wait);                   \
        for (;;) {                                                      \
                set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);    \
                if (condition)                                          \
                        break;
........................................
Is it possible that scheduling happen after set_current_state() but before
checking the condition ?
If yes - even if we will have condition==TRUE by this moment - the scheduler
will make the process to sleep anyway , right ?
Regards
