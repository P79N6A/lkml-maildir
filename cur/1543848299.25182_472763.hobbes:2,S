Hi, all.
I'm new to the list so forgive me in advance for any netiquette mistakes I 
make.
I wrote a driver for the accelerometer chip on HP nc6400 laptop (I think the 
same chip is present on
other NCxxxx models). This driver uses ACPI interface present in the bios 
and behaves pretty much like
hdaps. This is a fully functional version - tested on 2.6.17 and 2.6.18 (not 
2.6.19-rc1 since I have a
problem with that kernel on my laptop). It applies on 2.6.19-rc1 as well 
though. I would like your
remarks and suggestions on this. Also, should I mail this patch to a kernel 
maintainer? I could not find a maintainer that looks like the address for 
this patch. The closest one is the lm_sensors maintainer, but
that's probably wrong.
Thanks in advance
Yan Burman
