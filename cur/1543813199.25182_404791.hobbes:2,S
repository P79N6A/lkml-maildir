Yes.

No.  The new creation fails, but we end up with two "c" directories
under "b".

I agree, but that's not what happens :)

Yeah, I just couldn't figure out how to clean it up properly :)

That's great, thanks.
I have a test module that shows this at:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/patches/gregkh/sysfs-test.patch
just load the 'gregkh' module and look in /sys/class/gregkh/ to see the
duplicate "gregkh1" directories.
thanks,
greg k-h
