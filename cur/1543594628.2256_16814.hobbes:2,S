It seems that the Davicom NIC's is the problem in this system.
I have tried to swap them with new davicom cards, and tried
with only one of them.
Davicom DM9102AF is the chip on all the cards.
Adaptec SCSI 19160 Ultra160, 68/50pin  (7892B, rev2)
I changed the Davicom's with Intel cards (same IRQ), and now it works
flawlessly. I think this might be an error worth looking at..

Hi, i'm getting the following errors constantly while accessing my scsi disk
(10x per second or more)
"Kernel: scsi0: PCI error Interrupt at seqaddr = 0x*"
"Kernel: scsi0: Data Parity Error Detected during address or write data
phase"
(where * is a number, most often 8 or 9)
I'm running Kernel 2.4.6pre1 (also got it with 2.4.5)
Worked fine with the distro's kernel 2.4.0
Hardware:
  Adaptec SCSI 19160 Ultra160, 68/50pin  (7892B, rev2)
  MSI K7T-PRO2 motherboard (VIA chipset)
  Amd Duron 750Mhz cpu
  Winbond SDRAM (7ns)
  2x Davicom PCI 10/100 cards
  ATI 3D Rage IIc AGP
The computer is running SuSE 7.1 without X or other fancy
packages, as it is going to run a squid cache server.
The Scsi drivers are compiled into the kernel.
