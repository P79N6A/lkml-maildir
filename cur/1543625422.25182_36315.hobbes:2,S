I have a patch that introduces BUG_ON for 2.4.  I like the idea of
BUG_ON and it is certainly a place where the unlikely bit is useful. 
I've posted the patch here before; I was going to do so again against
the next 2.4-pre.
Further, and most importantly, the patch provides compatibility with 2.5
code that uses it.  I have no problems naming BUG_ON anything anyone
wants (Jeff's suggestion of kassert seems sane) but we should then do
the proper renaming in 2.5.
