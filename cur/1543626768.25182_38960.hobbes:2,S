On WOLK 3.2 i use swsusp and it works just fine on my P4 system.  With
the ac kernel i get a panic whenever i try to suspend.  I tried
including the couple lines that i patched in WOLK 3.2's swsusp mentioned
in the swsusp mailing list and still it panics.  Perhaps it's due to the
Taskfile stuff i compiled with, i'll try it without that stuff next. 
wish i could take a screenshot of the panic
