If its attached to atkbd then its not a PCism and its now
nicely modularised in the atkbd driver. Providing we have
a clear split between the core "morse sender" and the
platform specific morse output device (do we want 
morse_ops 8)) it should be clean and you can write morse
drivers for pc speaker, for non pc keyboard and even for
soundblaster 8)
