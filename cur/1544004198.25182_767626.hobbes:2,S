This works for now (though it's probably going to anger some people who
are trying to make generic distro kernels), but what we really need to
do is to make geode_gpio* defined even when we're not specifically
building with MGEODE_LX.  I'm not sure how best to do that, but the
answer probably includes using the generic x86 gpio api.
