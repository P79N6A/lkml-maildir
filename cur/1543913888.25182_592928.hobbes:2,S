I would like to happily report that the sky2 driver works great in  
the NIC on my tablet where the sk98lin and skge drivers both fail  
utterly and hang the kernel.  On another system the sk98lin and skge  
drivers don't recognize the chipset at all (missing PCI ID?) while  
the sky2 driver works perfectly for large quantities of data  
transferred.
Cheers,
