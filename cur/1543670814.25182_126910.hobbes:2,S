I forgot to mention 2.4.19 on Debian Woody, GigaByte GA-7VAXP/Athlon 
MX2500/512 MB (and several other Intel motherboards).
I am glad that you mentioned ext3 because while I curse ReiserFS, I really 
don't think that it is part of the problem. Definately PCI-dma related, but 
does onboard IDE (i.e., my system disk) use DMA in the same way that a PCI 
adapter such as Promise does?
