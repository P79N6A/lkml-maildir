Okay. Jeff, Alan -- 2.6.20.15 apparently working. A few weeks ago there was 
another report of a DVD drive failing detection on pata_amd (my CD and DVD 
drives work fine on pata_amd). Did some ATAPI timeouts change or something?
He's using:
00:1f.2 IDE interface: Intel Corporation 82801GBM/GHM (ICH7 Family) Serial 
ATA Storage Controller IDE (rev 02) (prog-if 80 [Master])

Okay, makes sense, seems the new driver simply can't grab the SATA part 
anymore when the old driver already's got the IDE part -- I wasn't sure 
about that (not a SATA user myself -- just noticed your report due to 
noticing that previous one due to pata_amd...).
The old SATA driver available from the IDE menu also does not support your 
chip, so I don't believe there are any workarounds -- you'll need the issue 
fixed.
