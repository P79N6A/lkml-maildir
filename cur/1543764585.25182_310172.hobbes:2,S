True, it's trivial to just add the patch when needed (aka building with 
-W), but the number of such patches add up and having them in the tree by 
default is less pain (for the -W user).  I'm not on a quest to make the 
tree -W clean, but I find -W useful to find the odd actual problem and a 
number of the warnings that -W spits out can be silenced without harm, 
those are the ones I aim to fix. But I see the point of not adding patches 
to make -W happy if it adds clutter for the non-W case, so I'll see if I 
can come up with a cleaner way to fix this case that will be more 
generally acceptable (perhaps Zwane's suggestion about using named 
initializers could result in something cleaner - I'll look at that)...
