There is some confusion in the SCSI world between SCSI as a transport 
and SCSI as a commands set and software communication protocol, which 
works above the transport. So, you can implement SCSI transport at any 
software (eg iSCSI) or hardware (parallel SCSI, Fibre Channel, SATA, 
etc.) way, but if the SCSI message passing protocol is used overall 
system remains SCSI with all protocol obligations like task management. 
So, pure software SCSI solution is possible. BTW, there are pure 
hardware iSCSI implementations as well.
