I find that puzzling, given that flush_unauthorized_files is only called
if the process is changing SIDs on exec, and running less certainly
doesn't involve a SID transition (at least for any policy that I have
seen).  I tried the sequence shown with 2.6.8.1-mm1 with SELinux enabled
and disabled, and did not see the behavior he describes.  Is the bug
reproducible?  Was he running with SELinux enabled or disabled?  What
policy did he have loaded?
