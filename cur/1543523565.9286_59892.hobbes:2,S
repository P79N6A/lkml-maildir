Could be USB.

All USB Host Controllers use one of 2 programming interfaces: UHCI or
OHCI.
To figure out the correct one, you can either brute force it (try both
drivers) or look at lspci -v and if it has a prog-if of 10, it's an OHCI
card.
Then after the driver is loaded, check to see if there's anything in the
kernel logs or (after running: mount -t usbdevfs none /proc/bus/usb) see
if there's anything extra in /proc/bus/usb/devices
