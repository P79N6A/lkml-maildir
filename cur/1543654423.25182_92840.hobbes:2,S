The new module stuff has been in for about three weeks now, many people
are having problems with it, and I have yet to see a single post praising
the *actual* benefits. Will there be a time when this is reverted and
rescheduled for a future release (2.7?) or is this a do-or-die feature?
It doesn't have the feel of something solid having a few corner cases
fixed, it feels like a bunch of band-aids which will unstick in future
releases and continue to be high maintenence.
