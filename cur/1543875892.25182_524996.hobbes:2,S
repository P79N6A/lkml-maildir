In commit 0475ac0845f9295bc5f69af45f58dff2c104c8d1 when converting
the converting the orphaned process group handling to use struct pid
I made a small mistake.  I accidentally replaced an == with a !=.
Besides just being a dumb thing to do apparently this has a bad side
effect.  The improper orphaned process group detection causes kwin to
die after a suspend/resume cycle.
I'm amazed this patch has been around as long as it has without anyone
else noticing something funny going on.
And the following people deserve credit for spotting and helping
to reproduce this.
