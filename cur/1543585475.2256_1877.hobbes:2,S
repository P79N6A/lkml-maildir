The Linux community definately provides the configuration testing that
could never be done in a lab setting.  At least one that most companies
could afford.

SGI is working on regression testing for Linux.  We have released some
of our tests and utilities under the Linux Test Project.  IMHO, a few
hundred tests aren't enough.  I need to make another big push with the
tests I've ported over the last few months.  
I believe there is some work in the Open Source Development Lab that
some IBMers could comment on.  I don't know if there is a web site
detailing their efforts yet.
