I don't think your patch alone would have been sufficient. With it it
would have depleted the local reserves and then jumped onwards to other
nodes (since the ALLOC_NO_WATERMARKS allocation doesn't have
ALLOC_CPUSET).
Unless there was a mem-policy restricting the zonelist (not sure if
cpusets and mem-policies are independent like that)
But your point stands.
