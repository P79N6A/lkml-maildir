	Hi;
	I havent tried 2.5.51 vanila, but 2.5.51 with dm-3 patch
is working well so far for me on LVM system. (All other 2.5
kernels tried would hit a BUG()-- already reported.)
	If anyone wants me to recommend some sort of stress test
let me know; Ive simpley constructed and populated several
fileystems, md5sum'ed all the files, bzip2'd them, rm'd them,
etc. Then several hours of looping kernel compiles.
	Thanks for the work of the contributers.
Paul
