I messed it up when I forward ported the throttle-rcu.patch
from 2.6.0+lots-of-instrumentation to 2.6.4-vanilla in order
to publish in lkml. The original patch did this -
@@ -110,6 +113,10 @@ static void rcu_do_batch(int cpu, struct
                head->func(head->arg);
                RCU_nr_rcupdates(cpu)++;
                count++;
+               if (count >= rcumaxbatch) {
+                       RCU_plugticks(cpu) = rcuplugticks;
+                       break;
+               }
        }
Sorry about that.

Does the throttle-rcu patch also help eliminate dcache flood ? You
can try by just changing count >= rcumaxbatch to ++count > rcumaxbatch.

Yes, I think we should consider using  limiting even in the non-preemptive
case.
