Hello,
Is there any way to controll bus enumeration at boot
time?
I am using 2.6.7 and 8.  The issue is I have a system
with 2 FC cards that are enumerated first before the
on board controller (scsi).  I need to know how to
make sure that:
1> the on board controller is first (so I can boot
properly)
2> make sure the FC cards are always enumerated in the
same order.
Thanks you for your help.
Phy
