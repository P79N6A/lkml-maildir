If you look at the sysvinit code, you'll see that rc.sysinit does get
a controlling tty, but the init code blocks all "user" signal (such as
SIGINT) before executing it. I assume this is done to prevent some
security problems, though I question its utility -- it's certainly
useful to ctrl-c out of a screwed up rc.sysinit, and the script can
block those signals itself if it wishes to.
