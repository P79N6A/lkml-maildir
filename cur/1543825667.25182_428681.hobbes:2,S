What do you think we're _talking_ about?
What do you think my example of sys_readahead() was all about?
WE DO HAVE EXACTLY THAT MECHANISM. IT'S CALLED PLUGGING!

What do you think plugging IS?
It's _exactly_ what you're talking about. And yes, we used to have 
explicit unplugging (a long long long time ago), and IT SUCKED. People 
would forget, but even more importantly, people would do it even when not 
needed because they didn't have a good place to do it because the waiter 
was in a totally different path.
The reason it's kicked by wait_on_page() is that is when it's needed.
