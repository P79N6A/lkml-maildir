Agreed, but in either case we're in trouble with
loops = 0xffffffff (or close) - chances to break the loop
are small. Although such values must not be passed
to __delay anyway.
Alternatively we can use
	rpcc	%0
	addl	%1,%0,%1
1:	rpcc	%0
	subl	%1,%0,%0
	bgt	%0,1b
	: "=&r" (tmp), "=&r" (loops) : "1"(loops));
loops here must be positive int, but it's still up to
2+ seconds for 1 GHz.
Ivan.
