Mandriva is a French company.
And what Willy describes really sounds like someone fiddling with some 
settings (or something like accidentally selecting some non UTF-8 
locale).
Bad things can happen when you somehow get charsets mixed, but 
distributions default to UTF-8 for quite some time, and problems
with a 100% UTF-8 system have therefore become were unlikely.
