 "To summarize the feature:
    The old NFS had a feature whereby if a setuid process failed due to
  EACCES or EPERM, the RPC engine would drop the privileged credentials,
  and retry using the uid/gid (instead of fsuid/fsgid).
    Of course, this sort of thing may be a security problem, so in 2.4.x
  (and in 2.2.18pre) it has been disabled by default. Unfortunately some
  broken programs rely on this silliness instead of bothering to
  dropping privileges themselves (the setuid version of xterm trying to
  read ~/.Xauthority being one of the more prominent offenders); hence
  the decision to make a new mount option..."
