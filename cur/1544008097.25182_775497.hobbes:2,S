Sadly, no.  I'm trying to convince Oren that this is important, but I've
been unable to do so thus far.  I'd appreciate any particularly
pathological cases you can think of.
There are two cases here that worry me.  One is the case where we're
checkpointing a container that has been off in its own mount namespace
doing bind mounts to its little heart's content.  We want to checkpoint
and restore the sucker on the same machine.  In this case, we almost
certainly want the kernel to be doing the restoration of the binds.
The other case is when we're checkpointing, and moving to a completely
different machine.  The new machine may have a completely different disk
layout and *need* the admin doing the sys_restore() to set up those
binds differently because of space constraints or whatever.
For now, we're completely assuming the second case, where the admin
(userspace) is responsible for it, and punting.  Do you think this is
something we should take care of now, early in the process?

*Functionally* we know this design can work.  Practically, in Linux, I
have no freaking idea.  The hard part isn't getting it working, of
course.  The hard part is getting something that doesn't step on top of
everyone else's toes in the kernel and, at the same time, is actually
*maintainable*.
