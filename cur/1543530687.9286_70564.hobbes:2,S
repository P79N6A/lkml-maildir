I'm sorry. The question was not clear. How did you determine that
"DMA to user-space" meant from a driver? Further, how did you
determine that it was not an ISA device?
I thought that he said that he wanted to DMA multiple devices directly
to user-space. This doesn't seem like a "driver" to me, especially
since he explained how much "better" it would be than the "usual" way.
