Yes, but how?  If we don't take the hotplug lock, we are relying on the
callers to "prove" the cpu can't go away.  But we've already shown that
we can't find this by inspection :(

The easiest thing to do in this case is to use smp_call_function_single(),
since the thing we want to do is just rdmsr and wrmsr.
How about this instead of reverting?
Rusty.
fix: use smp_call_function_single() not work_on_cpu in acpi-cpufreq.c
get_measured_perf() gets called through twisty chains, and
work_on_cpu() has issues being called here as it takes the cpu hotplug
lock.
So we just use smp_call_function_single() which should work fine for
this case.
