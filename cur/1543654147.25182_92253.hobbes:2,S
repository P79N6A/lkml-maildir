The major problem with this idea is the question: who will pay for
keeping this database of motherboard models, et. al, up to date?
If it is done purely on a voluntary basis, it will have huge gaps, and
then there will be people complaining about why the #!@$#@
configuration system doesn't list their motherboard.  Even Microsoft
hasn't attempted to do what you have described, and for good reason
--- new motherboards and new chipsets appear far too often for any
software product to be able to track this with any hope of success.
