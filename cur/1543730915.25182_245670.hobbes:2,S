Ouch.
I think Hans' idea is (I don't know if it is a good idea nor if it is
doable, but at least it sounds interesting) to have special compound
files where you can do something like this:
cp text.txt test.compound/test.txt
cp image.jpg test.compound/image.jpg
And if you read test.compound (the main stream) you get a special format
that contains all the components. You can copy that single stream of
bytes to another (reiser4) fs and then access test.compound/test.txt
again.
The only thing I'm worrying about with this approach is what happens if
someone tries to simultaneously open test.compound and
test.compound/test.txt.
Hans has an example somewhere where he does something like that
with /etc/passwd.
