Sorry to be off topic, but I can't seem to find working samba information
anywhere.  Does anyone here know is where I should look?
ping samba.org  # fails, so i can't get on the lists
lynx 
http://samba.edu.au/samba/
 # hangs
ftp.samba.org doen't answer,
and all the search engines I look at point to samba.org stuff.
Are there mirror sites that I might be able to see?  
Thanks for your time,
Dave.
