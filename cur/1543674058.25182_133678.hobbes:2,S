The patch is uglyh as hell, though.  The right fix is to change the
->nopage method to cover what do_no_page is currently, change anonymous
vmas to have vm_ops as well and set ->nopage to do_anonymous_page.
The gets of the current do_no_page become a new helper (__finish_nopage?)
and EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL()ed.  It would also be nice if you could point to
a filesystem that actually needs this, but if you can get rid of the
do_anonymous_page special casing a patch might even be acceptable without it.
