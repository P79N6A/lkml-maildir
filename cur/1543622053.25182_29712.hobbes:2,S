Eric,
  Thanks very much to both you and Alan.  You were exactly right.  The version
of /sbin/init on our filesystem was quite old (2 years old).  I grabbed the tar
ball of the newest version, and using this version (without the "#if 0" lines)
works just fine because it sets up the console properly.
Thanks again.
