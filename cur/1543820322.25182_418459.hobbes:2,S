OK, let's get a couple of things clear...
No one here "hates" C++ per se. It is a tool, and every tool has its purpose.
Using C++ in the kernel has not been deemed apropriate for several
reasons. There are several (other) reasons to make the Linux Kernel C
only, this has been discussed, trolled, flamed, argued, come, gone,
etc, etc FAQs and searches are your friend there.
In your scenario, you have two possible option (IMHO)
1 - Port your existing code to C
2- keep it in C++, keep it in user level and have a simple file system
driver communicating with your existing code (I think FUSE applies to
the situation)
