Stephan,

The WD1800BB and the WD1200BB use the same technology (same data density,
fewer platters).  The streaming speed should be very similar.

OK.  We've found a potential issue.  Are the disks being identified as
UDMA-33 or UDMA-66/100/133?  The performance numbers agree too closely for
this to be a coincidence.  Check the boot logs.
Good luck.
