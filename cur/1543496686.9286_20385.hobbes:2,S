Your patch is wrong. The eof bit should be set by the server: see RFC
1094. By setting the eof bit indiscriminately on each page on the
client side, you are limiting directories to what can fit inside a
single 4K page.
If by 'glibc RH5.2+' you mean RH5.2 with glibc-2.1 then please note
that there seems to be a bug in the latter. I saw a similar problem to
what you describe on our SMP server was using the NFSv3 stuff (which
has a completely rewritten dircache handling). In my case, installing
nscd seems to have cured the problem.
Cheers,
