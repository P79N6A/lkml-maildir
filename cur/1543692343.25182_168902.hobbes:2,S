Hallo Malte,
Hallo list-members,
my solution for getting a reliable NFS Server with 2.5 kernels was
to use "no_subtree_check" in /etc/exports.
(The next thing is pasted, please read below the code)
I stumbled over the following lines of code in fs/nfsd/nfsfh.c:
int nfsd_acceptable(void *expv, struct dentry *dentry)
{
        struct svc_export *exp = expv;
        int rv;
        struct dentry *tdentry;
        struct dentry *parent;
        if (exp->ex_flags & NFSEXP_NOSUBTREECHECK)
                return 1;
        tdentry = dget(dentry);
        while (tdentry != exp->ex_dentry && ! IS_ROOT(tdentry)) {
                /* make sure parents give x permission to user */
                int err;
                parent = dget_parent(tdentry);
                err = permission(parent->d_inode, S_IXOTH, NULL);
                                                  ^^^^^^^ <- !!!!
                if (err < 0) {
                        dput(parent);
                        break;
                }
First, nfsd_acceptable always returns success if subtree_checks are
diabled. Second, I think, the line marked above is not correct.
The comment says "give x permission to user", but the call looks
suspiciously wrong.
You can also make the error disappear by allowing setting all x bits
for "other" from your mount-point down to the directory where the error
appears.
Echoing "32767" to /proc/sys/sunrpx/nfs_debug helped me a great deal
to find that error.
Cheers,
Patrick
