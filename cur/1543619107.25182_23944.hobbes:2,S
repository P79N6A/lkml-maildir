Actually it's more like UDP. *grin* Least with TCP we get an ACK that the 
connection is accepted, and some sort of status is kept. Not so sure we 
have that with you all the time.
But hey, lots of things run over UDP, just a matter of making sure everyone 
realizes it's not a guaranteed medium really, isn't it?
