Good report. To tell the truth, I know that this lockup exists,
there's an RH issue-tracker item against me on this.
It is different from the old "porkchop" lockup, which DaveM and
Jeff Garzik fixed.
The stumbling block is that NMI oopser catches a thread which
gets stuck because of the lock, but this does not explain
how the lock was taken.
I think the best resolution would be an instrumentation patch
which records lock takers, and prints them when the thing is
forcefuly oopsed. I should come with it eventually, if someone
does not beat me to it (I wish they did, actually :-)
