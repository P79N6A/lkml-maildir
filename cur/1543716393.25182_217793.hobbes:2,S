We all are, don't worry.

Absolutely. But "in theory" is a thing we may want to strive for, but not 
at the expense of "in practice".
Sadly, we used to encourage (yeah, yeah, I should 'fess up: it was me, I'm 
guilty, I was stupid) user-space code to include kernel headers. 
Admittedly, that was about ten years ago, and we've tried to fix it ever 
since, but the thing is, I think backwards compatibility in the end is 
more important than "in theory". And silently breaking things in subtle 
ways would be bad.
What we _could_ do is to move _all_ the "_syscallX()" stuff into the
__KERNEL__ define, which would at least break any potential pre-glibc
users in a very visible way. What I _don't_ want to do is to have somebody
by mistake compile against updated kernel headers, and it still compiles,
but just doesn't work at run-time the way it's supposed to. THAT is
confusing and bad.
In short: either we should make non-kernel users break in _really_ obvious
(and hopefully easy-to-fix) ways, or we should keep things compatible. 
None of the "oh, the return value changed subtly" thing, please ;)
