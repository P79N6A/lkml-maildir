It was not only a warning here, but the pptp client also didn't work again
until after rebooting. Every time the connection was retried (every 10
seconds or so) the message appeared. Perhaps this is a problem in the pptp
client, but after rebooting it worked.
As for the patch: applied to vanilla 2.6.5 (applied cleanly, offset -5
lines) and compiling now.
One problem though: I'm running 2.6 for about two weeks now (with a 24x7
pptp connection), and I encountered this problem just once. I've seen a
report that someone got this error when his connection was severed, so
I'll try to pull the phone cable a few times and see how it recovers, both
with and without your patch. I'll report back when I know more.
Thanks,
