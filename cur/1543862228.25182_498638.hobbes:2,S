It is OK since in it821x_fixups() we set it explicitly:
		if(strstr(id->model, "Integrated Technology Express")) {
			/* In raid mode the ident block is slightly buggy
			   We need to set the bits so that the IDE layer knows
			   LBA28. LBA48 and DMA ar valid */
			id->capability |= 3;		/* LBA28, DMA */
and we are better off using generic helper if we can
(which may later allow us to use generic tuning code).

Before my patch hwif->autodma was only checked in the chipset specific
hwif->ide_dma_check implementations.  For ide-cris it is
cris_dma_check()
function so there no behavior change here.
Sorry for not explaining changes in detail in the patch description
(I will update it).
