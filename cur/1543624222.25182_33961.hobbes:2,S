DFT = Drive Fault Tolerance
It is an IBM utility which performs extensive diagnostics of a hard drive.
At present this is a DOS program which is used via a dos boot disk.
Have look at the IBM website where you can download this (you can get a dd
image of the boot floppy from there, too, if you don't have Windows).
The idea behind native DFT is to be able to perform drive diagnostics from
within the OS without rebooting with a DOS disk and tying up the system
for hours during the checks. The advantages of this combined with IDE/SCSI
hot swap are strikingly obvious...
The utility also returns a special fault code which in combination with
the ibm website allows you to return a faulty disk and obtain a
replacement very easily.
Best regards,
	Anton
