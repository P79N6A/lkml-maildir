Well, I have no idea how this is even possible.
On ia64 HOTPLUG_CPU depends only on SMP && EXPERIMENTAL and the patch doesn't
change that.  Moreover, SUSPEND_SMP_POSSIBLE cannot be set on ia64, either with the
patch or without it.
Anyway, I'm going to drop the "HOTPLUG depends on PM_SLEEP_SMP" bits and retest
with allmodconfig on everyting I can test.
BTW, the patch is needed to fix compilation problems on PPC.

Rafael
