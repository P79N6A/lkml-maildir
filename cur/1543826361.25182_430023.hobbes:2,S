hm, i sent a patch to fix that, long time ago.

in the debug case we go into the 'slowpath' all the time - so that we 
can do the debug checks under the mutex lock.
if we get real contention then we have a might_sleep() check that will 
catch that.
i'd suggest to push 
work-around-ppc64-bootup-bug-by-making-mutex-debugging-save-restore-irqs.patch 
upstream - i thought we agreed that while it's a bit hacky and slows the 
mutex code down a bit, it's not practical right now to forbid 
uncontended mutex_lock() in early init code?
