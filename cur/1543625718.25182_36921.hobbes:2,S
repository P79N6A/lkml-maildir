I look at the glibc code. It uses a constant RLIM_INFINITY for a given
arch. The user always passes (~0UL) to glibc on x86. glibc will check
if the kernel supports the new getrlimit at the run time. If it
doesn't, glibc will adjust the RLIM_INFINITY for setrlimit. I don't see
how glibc 2.2.5 compiled under kernel 2.2 will fail under 2.4 due to
this unless glibc is misconfigureed or miscompiled.

The problem is not all arches use (~0UL) for RLIM_INFINITY.
# cd linux/include
# grep RLIM_INFINITY asm-*/resource.h | grep define
asm-alpha/resource.h:#define RLIM_INFINITY      0x7ffffffffffffffful
asm-arm/resource.h:#define RLIM_INFINITY        (~0UL)
asm-cris/resource.h:#define RLIM_INFINITY       (~0UL)
asm-i386/resource.h:#define RLIM_INFINITY       (~0UL)
asm-ia64/resource.h:#define RLIM_INFINITY  (~0UL)
asm-m68k/resource.h:#define RLIM_INFINITY       (~0UL)
asm-mips64/resource.h:#define RLIM_INFINITY  (~0UL)
asm-mips/resource.h:#define RLIM_INFINITY       0x7fffffffUL
asm-parisc/resource.h:#define RLIM_INFINITY   (~0UL)
asm-ppc/resource.h:#define RLIM_INFINITY        (~0UL)
asm-s390/resource.h:#define RLIM_INFINITY   (~0UL)
asm-s390x/resource.h:#define RLIM_INFINITY   (~0UL)
asm-sh/resource.h:#define RLIM_INFINITY (~0UL)
asm-sparc64/resource.h:#define RLIM_INFINITY    (~0UL)
asm-sparc/resource.h:#define RLIM_INFINITY      0x7fffffff
What should we do about it? I know e2fsprogs-1.26 doesn't work on mips
nor alpha because of this. I don't think it works on sparc.
BTW, mips has
/*
 * SuS says limits have to be unsigned.
 * Which makes a ton more sense anyway.
 */
#define RLIM_INFINITY   0x7fffffffUL
It doesn't make any senes.
