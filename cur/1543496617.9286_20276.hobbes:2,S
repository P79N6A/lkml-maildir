Grrrr... I've looked through the buffer.c interaction with loop.c and I
got some questions (read: caught several suspicious places).
a) While irrelevant in this situation, anti-deadlock protection (allowance
for 2-fold amount of requests) will break violently for loopback over
loopback.
b) Maybe more relevant here: do_lo_request() calls bmap(). Which can
easily lead to several bread() calls. There we go again.
First of those is almost certainly a bug. I'm less sure about the second
one, though. Could somebody comment on those? Andrea? You've dealt with
buffer.c lately...
