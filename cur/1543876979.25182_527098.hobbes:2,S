I'm not sure what you're referring to.
void get_writeout_scale(struct backing_dev_info *bdi, int *scale, int *div)
{
        int bits = vm_cycle_shift - 1;
        unsigned long total = __global_bdi_stat(BDI_WRITEOUT_TOTAL);
        unsigned long cycle = 1UL << bits;
        unsigned long mask = cycle - 1;
        if (bdi_cap_writeback_dirty(bdi)) {
                bdi_writeout_norm(bdi);
                *scale = __bdi_stat(bdi, BDI_WRITEOUT);
        } else
                *scale = 0;
        *div = cycle + (total & mask);
}
where cycle ~ vm_total_pages
scale can be a tad off due to overstep here:
void __inc_bdi_stat(struct backing_dev_info *bdi, enum bdi_stat_item item)
{
        struct bdi_per_cpu_data *pcd = &bdi->pcd[smp_processor_id()];
        s8 *p = pcd->bdi_stat_diff + item;
        (*p)++;
        if (unlikely(*p > pcd->stat_threshold)) {
                int overstep = pcd->stat_threshold / 2;
                bdi_stat_add(*p + overstep, bdi, item);
                *p = -overstep;
        }
}
so it could be that: scale / cycle > 1
by a very small amount; however:
if (bdi) {
        long long tmp = dirty;
        long reserve;
        int scale, div;
        get_writeout_scale(bdi, &scale, &div);
        tmp *= scale;
        do_div(tmp, div);
        reserve = dirty -
                (global_bdi_stat(BDI_DIRTY) +
                 global_bdi_stat(BDI_WRITEBACK) +
                 global_bdi_stat(BDI_UNSTABLE));
        if (reserve < 0)
                reserve = 0;
        reserve += bdi_stat(bdi, BDI_DIRTY) +
                bdi_stat(bdi, BDI_WRITEBACK) +
                bdi_stat(bdi, BDI_UNSTABLE);
        *pbdi_dirty = min((long)tmp, reserve);
}
here we clip to 'reserve' which is the total amount of dirty threshold
not dirty by others.

Good point, .1 seconds is a lot of time.
I'll cook up something like that if nobody beats me to it :-)
