This should really be IPPROTO_UDP as defined in <netinet/in.h>

You are right, this is really a huuuuuge buffer. If you are getting a 1.5kb 
packet every 80 ms on average, this is about 20kb/second. Even a 64kb buffer 
should be much more than enough.
My advice is just request a 64kb buffer, and stop messing with the rmem_default 
and rmem_max parameters.
