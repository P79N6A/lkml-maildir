SuSE always starts the portmapper when starting NFS, and as I'm using NIS as 
well I'd notice it if the portmapper were not available. The 
/etc/rc.d/nfsserver script refuses to run when the portmapper is not 
available. So I find it unlikely that that would be the case with my 
configuration.
If it's a VFAQ, where's the FAQ? It's not my normal behavior to break in onto 
lists and post questions, but I couldn't find anything pertaining to my 
problem...
