Subject: [PATCH 2/3] lib/string.c cleanup : remove pointless register keyword
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Removes a few pointless  register  keywords. register is merely a compiler 
hint that access to the variable should be optimized, but gcc (3.3.6 in my 
case) generates the exact same code with and without the keyword, and even 
if gcc did something different with register present I think it is doubtful 
we would want to optimize access to these variables - especially since this 
is generic library code and there are supposed to be optimized versions in 
asm/ for anything that really matters speed wise.
