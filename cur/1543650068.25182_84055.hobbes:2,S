What I want is irrelevant, it's Linus's call.  I'm just doing a little 
volunteer secretarial work until his return.
I'll put out one more version of the list this evening, and possibly one more 
on Monday if Linus hasn't replied to it by then and there are significant 
objections.  But that's it.

Well you are. :)
Nice mammoth, though.

What, as in "glad we're not them"?  (I suppose thanksgiving is coming up.  But 
the holiday in question is Halloween.  Celebration of sweet tooth, not 
generic gluttony.  We americans put enough effort into this area we need 
specific holidays for the aspects of it, dont'cha know. :)

And spoil my appetite for dinner?
I haven't personally been motivated by the potential for microsoft to make any 
sort of technical achievement since...  At least 1996, probably earlier.  I'm 
not thinking about Microsoft, I'm thinking about Linux.

I'm all for it.  I just can't put a patch on the list that doesn't exist yet.  
(I suppose the entry could say "go bug Hans for a patch"... :)
I'll think of something...
