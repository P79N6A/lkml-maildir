Would someone care to spemd a moment to tell me what the spin_lock_bh
does that spin_lock alone does not do?  (not just "local_bh_disable",
pleasse :-).  I am chasing SMP oopses for filesystems mounted on nbd
which only seem to happen in association with high memory stress (and
possibly "high memory"), and I suspect I am going to be interested by
the answer.
There is no commentary that I can find in the source, beyond the
assembler code in local_bh_enable().
