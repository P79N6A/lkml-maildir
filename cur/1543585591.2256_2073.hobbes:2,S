Do you also have IDE_AUTO_WHATEVER option enabled , 
as suggested ( no, commanded ) in the VIA_IDE_OPTION help text ?
( press '?' when selecting the VIA IDE driver option )
cat /proc/ide/via ?
What do you think is the "correct" transfer rate of the disk ?
For the record , I have a MSI K7T Pro2A board ( VIA KT133 with a
vt82c686b south bridge ) and a IBM DTLA 307045 hard drive on a 80
wire IDE cable ( set to CABLE-SELECT , connected to the end connector;
you must always first use both connectors on the end of the cable !
never left one end unused )
Without doing any settings with hdparm, I get the full transfer rate
of the disk, measured with hdparm : ~35MB/s
kernel is 2.4.recent or redhat recent 2.4.x versions.
