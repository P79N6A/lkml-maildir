Well, if you want portable - do it in userland and use CODA...

Better do it early, while amount of code is not too large.  Endian-clean
code is easy.  The rule is: never treat any "integer" types from disk as
assignment-compatible with int.  Always use something like fs32_to_cpu(),
etc. - it's cleaner that way and inlined functions actually work fine.

See above (and check how sysvfs does it - there it's even more obvious,
since you have to deal with _3_ variants of on-disk bytesex (big-endian,
little-endian and NUXI).

Same thing - endianness issues.
