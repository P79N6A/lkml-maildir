Hello...
I am wondering is there is a way to obtain resource usage 
from the kernel w/o doing a kernel call from a program
(can I get this from /proc/??  ?).
For example, I am interested in discriminating between
processor idle time, time spent in processes, etc.
Is this possible, or will I have to get this accounting
information from the kernel via a module/system call?
Thanks
Tom
