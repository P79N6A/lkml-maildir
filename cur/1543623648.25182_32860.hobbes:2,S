Subject: [BETA-0.96] Seventh test release of Tigon3 driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Not much changed, just one biggie.  Get it at:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davem/TIGON3/tg3-0.96.patch.gz
Changes:
[PERFORMANCE] Don't mess with DMA read/write boundary settings on X86
	      Should result in significant performance increases on
	      this platform.  I'm rather confident our driver performs
	      better than Broadcom's driver on all platforms now.
[PATCH-ERROR] Some parts of 0.95 didn't apply directly due to some
	      botched up hand patch editing on my part, sorry :-)
Please test and benchmark, and I'll be away until Saturday to look
into reports.
And you Aussies, you know what you need to do :-))))
