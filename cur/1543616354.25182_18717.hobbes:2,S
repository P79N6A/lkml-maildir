The interesting thing that I currently do with initrd support is a
custom network-booted Linux installer for an embedded system. 
I'd like to be able to do this with initramfs too.  It needs:
- busybox, of course
- sfdisk  (scripted fdisk)
- mkreiserfs
- lilo
- dhcpcd
- A utility to display images in the framebuffer, like "fbv".
