Ok, I will roll back to vanilla 2.6.20 tomorrow.

For example this ones (essentially the same, except that epoll and
kevent are used):
http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/archive/kevent/evserver_kevent.c
http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/archive/kevent/evserver_epoll.c

Yep.

If they are too good, I will start searching for bugs and tune my code
first, but eventually of course yes. 
In my blog I will post them in 'real-time' even if kevent will
unbelieveably suck.

I have a git tree at (based on rc1 as requested by Andrew Morton):
http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/archive/kevent/kevent.git/
Or patches at kevent homepage:
http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/old/?section=projects&item=kevent
Direct link to the latest patchset:
http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/archive/kevent/kevent-37/
(order is insignificant as far as I recall, except 'compile-fix',
whcih must be the latest).
