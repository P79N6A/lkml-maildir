No, but the point is, everybody _would_ consider it a bug if a
low-level driver "write()" did anything but touched the explicit buffer.
Code like that would not pass through anybody's yuck-o-meter. People would
point fingers and say "That is not a legal write() function". Anybody who
tried to make write() follow pointers would be laughed at as a stupid git.
Anybody who makes "ioctl()" do the same is just following years of
standard practice, and the yuck-o-meter doesn't even register.
THAT is the importance of psychology.
Technology is meaningless. What matters is how people _think_ of it.
