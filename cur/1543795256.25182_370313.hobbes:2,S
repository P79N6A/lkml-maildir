Hrm... let me see... You are getting an interrupt for EHCI after it has
been resumed, so it should work.
 /me double-checks the patch
> ehci_hcd 0000:00:02.2: lost power, restarting
Hrm... I can't find that line in the code...
 /me rechecks with david's other patches
Ah ... I see it. There might have been some screwup between david's
patch and mine.
Make sure that 
       set_bit(HCD_FLAG_HW_ACCESSIBLE, &hcd->flags);
Is still done before anything else in ehci_pci_resume(). It may be worth
following it with a memory barrier actually... just in case (due to the
absence of locks in that area).
Ben.
