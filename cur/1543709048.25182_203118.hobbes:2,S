kbuild scans for dependencies and build the output file in one go.
Therefore from a make perspective it will not see the new dependency of
nfsd_idmap.h when starting to compile nfsctl.c.
Dependencies are first OK after first kernel compile.
So if you tried twice the 'bk get' functionality should be OK.
