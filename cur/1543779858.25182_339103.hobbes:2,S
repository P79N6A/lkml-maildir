I'm at a disadvantage here as the linux mm system is one area I've
avoided getting too deeply involved with so far. My knowledge is
therefore limited and I won't know what correct or incorrect behaviour
would look like.
We know the the failure case can be identified by the
cmpxchg_fail_flag_update condition being met. Can you provide me with a
patch to dump useful debugging information when that occurs?
