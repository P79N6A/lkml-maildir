That's not the part of the patch I object to - fixing that is fine.
What I object to it that it special-cases the zone names, even though that
doesn't necessarily make any sense at all.
What about architectures that have other zones? THAT is the kind of
fundmanental design mistake that special-casing DMA and NORMAL is horrible
for.
alloc_pages() doesn't have that kind of problem. To alloc_pages(),
GFP_BUFFER is not "oh, DMA or NORMAL". There, it is simply "oh, use the
zonelist pointed to by GFP_BUFFER". No special casing, no stupid #ifdef
CONFIG_HIGHMEM.
THAT is what I object to.
