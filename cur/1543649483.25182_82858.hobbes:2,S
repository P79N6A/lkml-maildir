Subject: module_init in interrupt context ?

With kernel 2.4.19 I noticed that calls from module_init()
may be done in interrupt context. I didn't have a problem here
before 2.4.17.
E.g. in module_init() I use pci_module_init() for my driver
(I don't have HOTPLUG enabled), the when the .probe function is called
and the card is detected I create a proc entry for this new
found device, but most of the time create_proc_entry causes
BUG(), because it is called from interrupt context.
What and where is the reason for that ?
Shall the pci_module function be interrupt-save, or
all functions called from module_init() ?
Thanks,
Armin
