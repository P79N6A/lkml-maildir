	Hi Marcelo,
	It's now your turn to get IrDA patches. It's what I sent to
Linus, minus the 2.5.X specific bits.
        Patches have been tested in 2.4.19-pre2 (SMP). All non
critical patches have been on the IrDA list for more than one month
(in particular all the changes to LAP Tx queue).
        Have fun...
        Jean
[FEATURE] : Add a new feature to the IrDA stack
[CORRECT] : Fix to have the correct/expected behaviour
[CRITICA] : Fix potential kernel crash
ir249_sock_connect_cli.diff :
---------------------------
	o [CRITICA] Fix socket connect to remove dangerous cli()
	<Tested on SMP>
ir249_irnet_disc_ind.diff :
-------------------------
	o [CORRECT] Fix IrNET disconnection to not reconnect but
	  instead to hangup pppd
ir248_lap_icmd_fix-4.diff :
-------------------------
	o [CORRECT] Fix Tx queue handling (remove race, keep packets in order)
	o [CORRECT] Synchronise window_size & line_capacity and make sure
	  we never forget to increase them (would stall Tx queue)
	o [FEATURE] Group common code out of if-then-else
	o [FEATURE] Don't harcode LAP header size, use proper constant
	o [FEATURE] Inline irlap_next_state() to decrease bloat
ir249_usb_cow-2.diff :
--------------------
	o [FEATURE] Don't use skb_cow() unless we really need to
	o [CORRECT] Reorder URB init to avoid races
	o [CORRECT] USB delay adds processing time, not removes it
