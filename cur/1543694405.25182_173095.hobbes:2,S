Oh, by all means the above isn't sufficient, just an example.  We have
already had 2 arch-specific assembly PRNGs that are much better than
the above that can be used if there is no HW RNG.  My point was that it
would be nice to hide the details of which PRNG and all the CPU selection
and config detection from callers in the kernel.
Cheers, Andreas
