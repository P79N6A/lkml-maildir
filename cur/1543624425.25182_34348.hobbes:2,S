	Maybe you are thinking of the patches that I posted a
while ago that included an update to some locking changes for
a bunch of the scsi drivers.  Alan spoke up and said that
I should not apply the NCR53C80 part of those patches because
I had made a mistake and becuase there was a newer driver in 2.4,
and provided some tips on porting the 2.4 driver.  I immediately
said I would follow Alan's advice and not submit patches
based on the old NCR53C80-based drivers.
	Maybe you were thinking of some other event when you
said "I believe changes to NCR53c80 were recently reverted back because
these 'fixes' lead to massive data corruption."  If so, I would be
interested in hearing about it.
