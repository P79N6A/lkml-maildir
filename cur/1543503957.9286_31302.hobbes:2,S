I know they're locally generated because the network sniffer saw them
when the net consisted merely of my box, another linux box, and the
network sniffer, all on a hub.

I recall the network guys telling me that they Ciscos were forwarding
the packet around.  I'll see if I can find out for sure exactly what
the packets looked like.
In any case, the network guys are testing a software upgrade on the
Cisco switches which doesn't suffer from this problem.
