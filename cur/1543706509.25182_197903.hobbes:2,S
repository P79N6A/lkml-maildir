I dont have much reiserfs experience on production systems so I cannot say
anything about its stability. However, about the external journal
question, my bonnie++ tests (which I would recommend you do them yourself)
showed not much increase in speed than with internal journal, than say,
xfs with internal or external (but the reiserfs values where much better
in general, at least in the many small files test).
As you said because its mostly read() that shouldnt matter. Dont forget 
noatime mount option :).
