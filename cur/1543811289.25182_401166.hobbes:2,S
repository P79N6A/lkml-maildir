The magic is "git-ls-remote". In particular, the "--heads" flag limits it 
to just showing branch heads.
Then you can feed that into "git fetch", which takes the format 
"localname:remotename" to tell it how to fetch.
In other words, something like
	git fetch remote $(git ls-remote --heads remote | awk '{print $2":"$2}')
should do what you asked for.
