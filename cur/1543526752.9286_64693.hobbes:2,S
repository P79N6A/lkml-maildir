No. Its bad and doesn't work.

In your case: never.

It is modified from the timer interrupt. It is also marked "volatile".
This means that the compiler is NOT allowed to move the "move jiffies
into a register" outside the while loop.
So, without that volatile the compiler would indeed be allowed to
do something like
	load jiffies, r4      ; jiffies temporarily in r4. 
	add  r4, 6, r5        ; calculate timeout into r5. 
0:	sub r4, r5, r0 
	jnz 0b
(which if the compiler is really good actually optimizes even futher:
0:	jmp 0b
)
but with the volatile attribute on the "jiffies" variable, it will
need to reload "jiffies" every time around the loop:
	load jiffies, r4      ; jiffies temporarily in r4. 
	add  r4, 6, r5        ; calculate timeout into r5. 
0:	load jiffies, r4      ; reload jiffies in r4. 
	sub r4, r5, r0 
	jnz 0b
And the timer interrupt will increment jiffies 100 times
a second, until the thing times out.
