Hi,
I am using FC4 with Kernel Version of 2.6.17-1.2142 & 2.6.11-1.1369. I 
tried to install 2.6.21.1 from source.
Installation goes well without any error. But when I rebooted my system 
in this new kernel. I got kernel panic error. Initially i got error 
related to Label for / . So i edited grub.conf & fstab and put drive 
path (/dev/sdx) instead of label. But then I got this error. I am unable 
to understand this error.
mount: error 6 mounting ext3
Error opening /dev/console!!!!: 2
error dup 2'ing fd of 0 to 0
error dup 2'ing fd of 0 to 1
error dup 2'ing fd of 0 to 2
Switchroot: mount failed :22
