Hi, Phillip,
I have said the gap between you and me is the definition of context.
In Robert's definition, *context* is used in a classification method
and really something in higher-level. And I used that term to explain
why ISR can not sleep.
If you do not like the name, name it your way and substitute term
*context* in my previous mail with what you name. But I believe my
other explaination still hold, right?
And again, if anyway I am forced to use your termnology system, I
would also agree your other point regarding hardware.
