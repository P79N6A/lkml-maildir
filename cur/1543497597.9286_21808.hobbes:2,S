I have to admit that my only experience of Slackware goes back to when
I first came across Linux, when a friend loaned me his Slackware
installation set. I was less than amused when my attempts to install
it resulted in a message informing me that my Intel P166 was an
invalid processor!!!
Shortly after that, Personal Computer World magazine included a full
RedHat Linux 4.1 installation on their cover CD, and that installed
like a charm, with no problems whatsoever, and with very little
thinking necessary on my part - I believe the most technical question
I had to answer related to my keyboard layout.
With the exception of the system referred to in your quote above, I
have never had any problems with RedHat Linux, and I've used 4.1, 5.0,
5.1, 5.2 and 6.0 installations, and for that reason, I have in general
stayed with RedHat.
Best wishes from Riley.
