Subject: [PATCH] regulator: move bq24022 init back to module_init instead of subsys_initcall
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/18/72

This workaround was needed when regulator/ was not linked before both
power/ and usb/otg/ in drivers/Makefile. Now that it is even linked
before mfd/, this patch makes sure that bq24022 isn't probed before the
GPIO expander is set up.
