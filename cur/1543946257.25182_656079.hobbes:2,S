ive been hackin away at mISDN for a while and use it with recent kernels 
  2.6.2X and have a patch for 2.6.24 (move from semaphore to complition) 
the distro we built is heavily reliant on mISDN (voip) i dont use the 
isdn kernel drivers at all any longer.
im all for mISDN been mainlined into the kernel and the old stuff been 
removed there could be users still it is marked as depricated and the 
plan was with 2.6 to use mISDN from the start.
