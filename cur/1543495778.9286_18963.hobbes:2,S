Remember, all of this hoo-ha is being generated by Microsoft's Marketing
department, *not* engineering.
I don't think they particularly care about getting anyone's attention
who is using linux.  We already know it works, or we wouldn't be using
it.  
They're trying to distract those who might otherwise consider linux as a
viable alternative to NT.  They've set the test up so that whether "the
Linux Community", Inc. shows up or not, they come out smelling rosy.
They win even if "the Linux Community" shows up for the test.  They've
already determined some configurations on which they can make NT perform
reasonably well against Linux (you don't think they'd do this unless
they already knew the results, do you?), and have placed the focus on
"NT vs. Linux" rather than "NT vs. Linux" on these narrow
configurations.  Let Red Hat propose a test and see if MS agrees to it.
Obviously, a more valid test would be to take a set of machines which
represents a wider slice of what different corporations and people
actually use.  Show the range of performance and then you'd have a
clearer picture.  But that's certainly not what MS/Mindcraft is after in
proposing the test.

nod.  but the challenge is legit.  The linux community did speak up at
the
flawed testing, and they want to make it right.  I would like to see
linux
beat nt in a test like that, for advocacy I suppose.
