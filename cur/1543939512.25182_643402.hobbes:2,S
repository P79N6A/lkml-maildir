Hi Ingo,
Can I talk you into dropping these patches of mine from sched-devel
(or not send them to Linus):
da0f9440cdcb1edd5424de91f326de83de3fe5f9 sched: make sure jiffies is
up to date before calling __update_rq_clock()
6eb300ad38fef6db4efe177067a65aaa771596da sched: fix rq->clock
overflows detection with CONFIG_NO_HZ
They are not of good enough quality, and I'm working on a better approach.
Thanks.
