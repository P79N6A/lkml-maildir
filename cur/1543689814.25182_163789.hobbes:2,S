So far, no major distribution does support an i386. Basically, this has
leaked in by some broken patch to libstdc++ which was not observed for a
long time. To support i386, an additional emulator for additional i486
needs to be compiled-in, too. I had a short try to port Debian's patch
into 2.6.x, but it oopsed :-> If I get some time, I'll finish that.
Before we have thie i486-emu-for-i386 in, i386 support in the kernel
doesn't make *any* sense on it's own...

Oh well, the Elan is a beasty thing:) However, I like your overall
approach, though.
