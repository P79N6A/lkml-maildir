Bus-powered != self-powered.
Self-powered means that it has its own power cord.
Bus-powered means that it gets its power from the USB cable.
Unlike Greg, I would have said that bus-powered hubs
can be a problem -- especially when you plug too many
devices into them that need lots of power.  What we saw
at the USB PlugFest was hubs just shutting down when
we did this.  :(
