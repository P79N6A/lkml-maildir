Hi!
Something is wrong with your solution, because I'm building a monolithic
kernel, so nvidia would be my only module. I have done make modules as
you've said (I think a simple make does that also, so it wouldn't be
required), and the Modules.synvers file doesn't exist. 2.6.5 works
normally, only using nvidia as a module. Note that module support is
compiled in the kernel.
