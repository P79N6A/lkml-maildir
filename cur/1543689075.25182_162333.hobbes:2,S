Well a new scheduler needs the same testing as an old scheduler.
The difference is less of it has been done.

First off, no general purpose scheduler should allow starvation depending
on your definition. The interactivity stuff, and even dynamic priorities
allow short term unfairness.
A cpu hog is not a starved process. It becomes a CPU hog because it is
running all the time. True, it mustn't be starved indefinitely by a lot
of higher priority processes. This is something Con's and my schedulers
both ensure.
Hmm... what else? The "didn't use their timeslice" thing is not
applicable: a new timeslice doesn't get handed out until the previous one
is used. The priorities thing is done based on how much sleeping the
process does.
Its funny, everyone seems to have very similar ideas that they are
expressing by describing different implementations they have in mind.
