q-tools is great and I'd really like to use it, but it would be great if 
readprofile worked too and reported callers into the contention function.  
I've already found that q-tools isn't that easy to setup on some machines, 
whereas readprofile is near universal, so I think there's value in making the 
latter work reasonably well, while still keeping its simplicity.
Thanks,
