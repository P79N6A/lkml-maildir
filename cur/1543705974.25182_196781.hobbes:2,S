I think the problem is not that it doesn't work with kernel, but it 
doesn't work with the application. And while some people may be able to 
ignore having a system which will work with both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels, 
for many systems it may not be practical to change config to something 
which will not work in 2.4 in hopes it might work in 2.6.
Marking the old driver as broken is fine, taking it out will certainly 
prevent anyone from fixing it. Better to have it around, I would think.
