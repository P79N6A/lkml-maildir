It's mainly the big ia32 boxes which a) have a lot of CPUs and
b) have a lot of memory and c) run a lot of tasks.  They're
gasping for normal-zone memory.
I'm half-inclined to just revert the whole thing and put the stats
back, rather than adding yet another obscure config option.  But
your patch is certainly very tidy...
