I'm not sure what value of stable you want, I've been using 2.6.0-test1
(ac?) with crypto since it came out. Clearly there are a lot of things
missing before 2.6 is ready for general use, but it sure is nice to have
that filesystem protected. The crypto seems stable, as long as that's the
main thing you do with the box.
I hope we can get the control of key length back, while I doubt that
anyone who actually could break the default is going to be involved in
anything I do, I'd like to see it for future applications.
