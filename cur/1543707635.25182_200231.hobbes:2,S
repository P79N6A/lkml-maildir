Yea, you be right. Many of those paths would not need to care about
TENTATIVE at all, so using the d_inode thing would make them uglier, I
agree. Maybe the flag is better after all (and it really should be pretty
well contained by just checking all __d_lookup callers, so it should be 
hard to get it wrong, but maybe I've forgotten some path).
We could do it both ways - do the TENTATIVE_INODE thing as a debugging 
thing at first to make sure none of these dentries escape, and then remove 
it (and the unnecessary tests in the pruning paths) once everybody is 
convinced that it is working correctly.
