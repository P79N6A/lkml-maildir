This is a nfs-server who serves web-servers (apache). I find a lot of these
messages, but they (upto now) only point to 3 different filenames. And these
are in fact all directories. The box never crashed and has currently 20 days
uptime. It is dual P-III and has 6 GB of RAM.
The questionable directories were created long before they first showed this
message and have never changed (regarding name-change). Their contents were
possible changed but surely not often meaning no more than once a day or once a
week.
It may well occur that multiple nfs-client systems _read_ them, as well as
multiple processes on one client.
The nfs-clients are 2.4.19 boxes and one 2.2.21.
