As mentioned before, if we ever modify tsk->flags, where tsk != current, we
have a nasty race.  So this function's interface really does invite that
race and hence is not very good.
As we do seem to be only calling it for current or for a newly-created task
I guess the access is OK, so perhaps a weaselly comment would cover that
worry.
