Yes, nobody is touching the resource once it is freed. But because of
double kobject_put() getting called in the kobject_unregister() code patch
I am seeing successive parent's kobject_unregister() causing panic as that kobject's
kobject_cleanup() gets called when childs kobject_unregiser() is getting called.
i.e patern's kobject_cleanup() gets called for some reason when clild's kobject_unregister()
is called. My patch fixes this issues.
