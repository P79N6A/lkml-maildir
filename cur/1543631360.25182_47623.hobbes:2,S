Yes.  Unfortunately a bunch of the bug fixes we made between 0.06f and
0.09b uncovered other, even worse, bugs - at least on some
hardware/firmware.
It also would have helped if I'd been pushing to the kernel more

Yes checking 0.11b, which is in Marcelo's latest -pres (and in
2.5.17), would be very helpful
