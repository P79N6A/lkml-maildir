The machines is not really thrashing yet, but I'd expect in another couple
days, if experience holds, that it will be gonzo.  I'd like to revert back
to 2.4.20 before then, as this is a production machine.  I'll leave it
going as is for a short while, however, in case anyone has any suggestions
about things I should look at while it's misbehaving.
