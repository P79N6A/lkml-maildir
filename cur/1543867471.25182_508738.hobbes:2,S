I think you may have mis-interpreted my words. *When* a schedule would 
block a synco execution try, then you do have a context switch. Noone 
argue that, and the code is clear. The sys_async_exec thread will block, 
and a newly woke up thread will re-emerge to sys_async_exec with a NULL 
returned to userspace. But in a "cachehit" case (no schedule happens 
during the syscall/*let execution), there is no context switch at all. 
That is the whole point of the optimization.
