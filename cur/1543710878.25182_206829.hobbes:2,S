Subject: [PATCH] klibc update
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Too big to post,
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/patchkits/2.6/2.6.5-rc1-klibc1.patch.bz2
	or
bk://kernel.bkbits.net/jgarzik/klibc-2.5
IIRC, this is:  my update of Bryan O'Sullivan's update of Greg KH's 
update of my merge of hpa's and viro's hacking :)
WRT overall klibc merge:  when it can do md RAID autorun, it's 
mergeable.  And didn't somebody write a tiny mdctl program...
