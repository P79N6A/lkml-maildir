	Because it is simple (how do you fcntl(2) from a shell fd?), has no
ranges (what do you do with ranges passed in to fcntl(2) and you don't
support them?), and has a well-known fork(2)/exec(2) pattern.  fcntl(2)
has a known but less intuitive fork(2) pattern.
	The real reason, though, is that we never considered fcntl(2).
We could never think of a case when a process wanted a lock fd open but
not locked.  At least, that's my recollection.  Mark might have more to
comment.
