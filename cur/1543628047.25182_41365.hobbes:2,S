Haha. come on, man - you`re the one with the magic wand :)
Just to let you know that both my WDC WD273BA and my WDC AC313600D
(both from the Expert series for those of you not familiar with WD drives)
are still working great with TCQ - now, without any
benchmark numbers to back me up, I actually think this release of the TCQ
implementation seems even smoother than previous releases. Hard
to explain, actually.
One more thing - it would be really great if all you guys out there
with WD drives could test TCQ and give Jens feedback if you stumble
over WD disks which support TCQ! (Western Digital has not been very
helpful in the process of adding support for TCQ on WD disks).
We seem to have figured out that Caviar disks do not support TCQ,
and that the Expert series does, so we`re interested in hearing from
guys with other WD drives, in particular :) You can use the
attached perl script, sent to me by Jens, to check you drives.
