How frequently?
Are you able to provide some actual numbers (expected and actual values),
so we can look at the bit patterns?

What driver drivers that?  b44.c?

We do perform racy 64-bit updates of some of the stats counters.  But
that'll only affect 32-bit kernels and I'm assuming you're running a 64-bit
kernel on that AMD64 box (are you?)
Plus it's odd that both the byte-counters and the packet-counters go wonky
at the same time.
