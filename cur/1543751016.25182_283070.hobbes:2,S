Setting the above two attributes from a Linux client accessing NTFS via
cifsfs pops up more often too. One scenario would be
  ntfsclone --fs-compression --output /mnt/cifsfs/backup.img /dev/foo
and the transparently compressed backup.img should be loopback mountable
by whatever preferred NTFS driver for whatever reason.
