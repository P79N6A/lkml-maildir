Oh my.  I beg to differ.

So why does it work, actually?

I don't really think so (see below).

pci_disable_device() does really only one thing: it clears the bus master bit.
Yes, it also calls pcibios_disable_device(), but on x86 this is a NOP.
I don't think it is SO bad, is it?

The driver using the new model is not supposed to save the state and power
off the device.  Still, it's probably a good idea not to trust the drivers. :-)

No, it shouldn't.
However, the patch below actually may help and it really is not too different
from my "new infrastructure" patch.  It leaves the pcie_portdrv_restore_config()
in the PCIe port driver's ->resume(), but that shouldn't change things,
pci_enable_device() in there shouldn't do anything and the bus master bit
should already be set.
The "new infrastracture" patch makes pci_disable_enabled_device() be called in
the suspend code path, but that only disables the bus master bit, and
pci_reenable_device() be called in the resume code path, but that only sets the
bus master bit back again.  So, they are almost the same and I'd be surprised
if your patch didn't help.
I had that "new infrastracture" patch ready yesterday and I thought it might
help, so I sent it.  I was too tired to prepare a new patch and that would
probably look like the one below (I'd remove the pcie_portdrv_restore_config()
from ->resume too, but that's only a detail).
Thanks,
Rafael
