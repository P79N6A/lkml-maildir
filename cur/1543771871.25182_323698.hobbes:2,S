I tried to resume immediately when the screen goes blank and got the
following results.  Out of 9 trials I got:
 - 4x: it would say "Restarting tasks..." but then oops and hang
   immediately.  See the oops below.
 - 4x: come back and give me a shell - but it hangs
 - 1x: come back, give me a shell and let me type; built-ins worked
   but commands produced the oops posted by Matthew a few days ago.
So far it has never come back when I don't resume immediately.
The new oops I got is:
root@(none):/# mount -t proc none /proc
root@(none):/# echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep
Stopping tasks: ===|
