Subject: [patch] i386, apic: fix 4 bit apicid assumption of mach-default

Andi/Andrew,
Can you pick this up for your trees and if there are no issues, can you please
push it to mainline before .23 gets released.
We have seen a boot failure with fewer cpu sockets populated on a MP platform.
Similar problem can happen on a fully populated system, if # of cpus <= 8
and any of the apic id's is > 16
thanks,
suresh

Fix get_apic_id() in mach-default, so that it uses 8 bits incase of xAPIC case
and 4 bits for legacy APIC case.
This fixes the i386 kernel assumption that apic id is less than 16 for xAPIC
platforms with 8 cpus or less and makes the kernel boot on such platforms.
