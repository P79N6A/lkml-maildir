no, it isn't a non-kernel issue.  this must be done atomically wrt the
user level, so it must be done in the kernel.  there's no good way for the
application (or library) to allocate a specific RT signal, so there must
be some form of "gentlemen's agreement" between libraries and application
as to which uses which signal.

alan, you can detect an overflow, but recovering from one is another
matter.
one might argue, though, that queue overflow is a good way to prevent
receiver livelock, and provide a nice smooth degradataion of performance
during system overload.  it really depends on how dangerous is a queue
overflow to correct application behavior.

asynchronous writev and sendfile are useful enough to want in many
applications.  why should each application developer reinvent the wheel?
however, maybe this can be done in the user-space threads library, if
there was some nice way to allocate RT signal numbers.
