there's one more new version:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.8-rc2-I4
this fixes another rare bug: release_task() could trigger a 'Badness'
atomicity message when the right conditions occur on a preemptible
kernel. This bugfix also allowed the addition of might_sleep() checks
(and hence voluntary-preemption points) to dput() and fput(), two common
functions.
