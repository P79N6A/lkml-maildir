That's probably because people got lazy with copying around the
definitions -- perhaps surprisingly this happens quite frequently in arch
headers ;-)
MIPS has a fixrange_init() which does things in more or less one shot.
__set_fixmap() is a good abstraction if you're interested in poking at
individual fixmaps, but at least the kmap fixmaps have special handling all
over the place (look for kmap_pte in the various highmem implementations),
and there are few fixmaps otherwise.

There are of course things that make this more attractive on x86,
especially with regards to the global bit and preservation across a TLB
flush, there's a note in arch/sh/mm/init.c above __set_fixmap() about
that. fixmap doesn't really have any special behaviour that makes an
architecture implementation problematic at least.
