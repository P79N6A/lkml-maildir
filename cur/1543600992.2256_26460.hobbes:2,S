Subject: [PATCH] Hotplug PCI driver for 2.4.10-pre8

Hi,
Another release of the Compaq Hotplug PCI driver is available at:
	
http://www.kroah.com/linux/hotplug/pci-hotplug-2001_09_12-2.4.10-pre8.patch.gz
This is a _unstable_ release, you have been warned :)
Changes since the last release:
	- forward ported to 2.4.10-pre8
	- first cut at moving the driver into two separate pieces.
I'm actively working on splitting the driver up into a "generic" hotplug
pci controller code, and a Compaq specific hotplug pci driver.  Right
now only the character driver piece has been split out.  Because of
the changes that were done to the ioctl interface, the existing
userspace tools will not work.  A version of the GTK+ tool that works
with this patch can be found in the cvs tree at sourceforge:
	
http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=32538
Any comments on the current interface from groups that are working with
other hotplug pci controllers is very welcome.
thanks,
greg k-h
