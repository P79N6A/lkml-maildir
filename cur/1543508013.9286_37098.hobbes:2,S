It happened again.  This time X didn't come back & I ultimately had to
reboot.  But, I was able to log in from another box on the net.  I
had:
   blinky kernel: stuck on TLB IPI wait (CPU#0) 
again according to dmesg, but I think they were the ones from the
previous freeze, because they didn't show up in /var/log/messages &
other things did.  The screen, mouse & kbd seemed frozen, but the
system responded to the magic-sysrq key (not on the screen, but the
responses are recorded in the logs).  But, killing X & setting the kbd
to XLATE didn't get the system back.  X was up at 50% utilization
before I killed it.  Now it looks more like X or the video card seized
up.  Anyone have any other ideas?
Video card according to output from startx:
   (--) SVGA: PCI: NVidia Riva TNT rev 4, Memory @ 0xe0000000, 0xe3000000
   (--) SVGA: chipset:  RIVATNT
   (--) SVGA: videoram: 16256k
