The second CPU is in a bottom half handler, ie most likely the local
interrupts are enabled. I though about a tiny patch which calls
smp_call_function() in wait_on_irq(): the IPI would call a stripped down
version of show_registers().
This has zero impact on the server, it only changes the behaviour _if_ the
server hangs.
What do you think?
