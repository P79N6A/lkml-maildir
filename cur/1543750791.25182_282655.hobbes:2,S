if it's long enough, ipfwadm should not have entered 2.6 at all. It's not
because you don't see any use to that particular feature that you can guarantee
that it is not used at all. At least, a large public call to get in touch with
the potentially unique user of this feature would be a start, but generally we
should not remove a feature from a stable kernel. What will go next ? minix,
because someone will decide that there have been many better filesystems for a
long time, so that's long enough ? Revert modules to modutils because someone
will think it's simpler for everyone to use a single toolset ? I have no
problem removing numerous feature between major releases, even breaking APIs,
but I really hate it when something which is called "stable" constantly
changes.

Frankly, sometimes I'm really wondering. We see lots of very clever ideas,
and sometimes people come up with concepts which can break existing apps, and
simply justify by "this should not have been done in the first time." (eg:
unexport syscall_table). But I'm certain that all these mistakes are caused
by those too long development cycles. Some developpers get bored by things that
irritate them, and prefer to fix the stable tree to stop what they believe is
an error, instead of waiting for the next release to fix it there.

All in all, I agree with you. The small differences lie in /proc files or
oops syntax, etc... But even old syscalls are still supported and that's fine.
I appreciate it when I read the packet(7) man page to find that even the
interface from linux 2.0 is still supported.
The problem is that nowadays, the userspace-visible code is not only in
userspace anymore, but also involves modules interfaces sometimes because
some commercial apps rely on modules (firewalls, virtual machines, etc...),
and their userspace is nuts without those modules, so in a certain way,
breaking some kernel internals within a stable release does break some apps.

I don't agree with you. "known" bugs become features of this particular
release and people learn how to play with them. The MM beahaviour when one
single user can crash the whole machine just accidentely playing with malloc()
would be called a bug on any other decent OS. For us it's a feature we have
been used to live with.
It's possible that 2.6 has fewer of those known bugs, but it still has many
yet-to-discover bugs (the first ones being all those 'my machine does not
boot anymore' reported here and caused by those too long release cycles).

I agree with you on the first part, but not on the second one, because as a
stable kernel implies it, it will still be possible to apply current patches
to new releases with very few efforts. Indeed, I have already sent rediffed
patches to different maintainers because they were easy to do. For a while
now, on 2.4, you can easily apply jiffies64, epoll, netdev-random, preempt,
lowlat, bme, squashfs, tux, etc... The list is long and demonstrantes what
stable code looks like. "stable" does not mean it will not crash, but it means
"it will not change much", eventhough this tends to imply the former.

I feel they're brave. I know several other people who went back, either because
they didn't feel comfortable with upgrades these size, which sometimes did not
boot because of random patches, or simply because of the scheduler which didn't
let them type normally in an SSH session on a CPU-bound system, or even a
proxy which performance dropped by a factor of 5 between 2.4 and 2.6. I know
they don't report it, but they are not developpers. They see that 2.6 is not
ready yet, and turn back to stable 2.4.

agreed.
