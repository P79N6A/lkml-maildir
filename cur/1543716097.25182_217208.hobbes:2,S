Hello,
I am implementing a /proc interface for our HBA which
registers as a SCSI HBA with the SCSI-midlayer. 
Hello,
I am aware of existing /proc/ implementations wherein
buffer-size is limited and data upto 4096 bytes
only is displayable via the "proc_info" entry-point in
the Scsi_Host_Template structure.
I would like to know what is the new methodology of
implementing /proc which is supposed to have overcome
the buffer-limitation of the earlier /proc handling.
- Kindly let me know
- Thank you
