Eh?  What kbuild2.5 does, last time I looked at it, is let the user pick from
the list of targets for that arch, for 'installable'.  This looks great
from the PPC side, which has ~6 targets for this right now.  No need to
limit to some 'generic' names or limit the number.  For 2.4, I don't think
we should bother to do anything, except _maybe_ change the text after
oldconfig/whatnot to say 'zImage or bzImage and then install'  Or nuke
it all together.
