I even explained why in my mail.
 "The box intentionally locks up, so we have a chance to know wtf happened."
What's easier to debug: A box that just spontaneously reboots, or a box
that locks up with doublefault information on screen ?

No release of Red Hat Linux ever shipped with a double fault hander.
RHEL4 is the only product we sell that has it. Fedora also has it since
FC2 iirc.

Same fan was transplanted to another box after that death, where it
was found to be as dead as the CPU & board it was previously plugged into.
Given the heat of the dead CPU, it's safe to say it wasn't operation
at time of death.
