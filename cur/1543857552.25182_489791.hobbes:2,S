Oh, an error of thought when I read the patch 
7dfb71030f7636a0d65200158113c37764552f93 made that statement. After more 
checking, sched.h is apperarently included in suspend.h from swap.h so 
the direct include of sched.h in most drivers was/is not nessecary.
Do you agree with the patch below then? This was how I first fixed it 
but found it strange no-one hit it before, and from there it went on... 
Thanks for the help. (Sign it?)
