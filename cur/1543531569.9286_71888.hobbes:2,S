Hi,
think there's a problem with loop device. I've tried to mount iso file
via loop device (loop build as module)
mount h3.iso /h3 -o loop -t iso9660 
that's ok.
in /var/log/messages:
kernel: loop: registered device at major 7
kernel: loop: enabling 8 loop devices
but cp /h3/some_file /tmp/ will freeze io disk subsystem. Everything
works except disk io operations.
h3.iso is ok, 2.2.13 kernel with loop module mounts it ok and cp works
ok as well.
