Hello,
Couple of questions for porting a Windows device driver to
Linux :
1) In Windows we have a device driver developmnet kit (ddk)
   to develop device drivers. In Linux do we have anything
   parallel to this ?
2) In Windows there is a VCOMM driver which is a standard
   commn. interface. Do we have anything parallel to this in
   Linux?
   If not, can anybody suggest an approach for porting
Thanks,
Girish
