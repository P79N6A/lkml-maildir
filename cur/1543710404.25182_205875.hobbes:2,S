Hello,
I have Debian  Linux with precompiled kernel 2.4.25. My box is with IDE 
RIDE (Highpoint)
The heaviest process, that I have is squid-cache. Its cache is about 1.7 
GB and cause good CPU and memory load.
The problem is that I start to receive the fallowing error in my logs:
__alloc_pages: 3-order allocation failed (gfp=0x20/0)
__alloc_pages: 3-order allocation failed (gfp=0x20/0)
__alloc_pages: 3-order allocation failed (gfp=0x20/0)
__alloc_pages: 3-order allocation failed (gfp=0x20/0)
__alloc_pages: 3-order allocation failed (gfp=0x20/0)
__alloc_pages: 3-order allocation failed (gfp=0x20/0)
I read some posts for this error for kernel up to  2.4.11, but I haven't 
SCSI nor USB. I can't understand what cause this error.
I dont't know if I have some phisical problem with my memory or disks.
I'm not in list so please answer me directly.
