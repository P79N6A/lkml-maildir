I think that automagic configuration for the common workload with some
way (sysfs|proc) to retrieve and set policies is the way to go.
With this kind of control we could have /etc/init.d/io-optimize that
paused the startup for 10 seconds and tests every device|controller in
fstab and optimizes according to the .conf file for latency or speed...
Or a daemon that retrieves statistics and adjusts the policies every minute?
Also, everybody says "do it in userland". This is doing (some of) it in
userland :)
