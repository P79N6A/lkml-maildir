When I was experimenting with something similiar, (but as a much more
common case) I had the problem of not waiting on pages that were being
written out if there was no other freable memory.   Which caused
programs that should have continued via mapping to die due to memory
allocation failure. 
This isn't likely to be an issue except for programs that use file
backed storage, exclusively, or nearly so.
I solved it with a wait_on_any_page routine that had a timeout, to
prevent any chance of deadlock.  Andreas work of adding a schedule_yield
appears to be a complementary common case fix, of making it likely the
i/o gets started.
Unless this becomes an issue we can probably just put this in the
queue of things to think about.  If the i/o queue was the common case
I'd be adapting my code right now.
