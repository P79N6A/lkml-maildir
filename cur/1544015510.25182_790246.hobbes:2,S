Compiz is now refusing to run, and says :
Jan 11 11:22:47 tux kernel: compiz:3330 map pfn expected mapping type
 write-back for d0040000-d0a40000, got uncached-minus
Due to the "write-back" part of the message, I've check /proc/mtrr and it
does contain :
[root@tux log]# cat /root/mtrr-2.6.29-rc1 
reg00: base=0x000000000 (    0MB), size= 2048MB, count=1: write-back
reg01: base=0x07f800000 ( 2040MB), size=    8MB, count=1: uncachable
reg02: base=0x07f700000 ( 2039MB), size=    1MB, count=1: uncachable
reg03: base=0x0d0000000 ( 3328MB), size=  256MB, count=1: write-combining
When running 2.6.28, it does contain :
[root@tux log]# cat /proc/mtrr 
reg00: base=0x000000000 (    0MB), size= 2048MB, count=1: write-back
reg01: base=0x07f800000 ( 2040MB), size=    8MB, count=1: uncachable
reg02: base=0x07f700000 ( 2039MB), size=    1MB, count=1: uncachable
reg03: base=0x0d0000000 ( 3328MB), size=  256MB, count=1: write-combining
so it's exactly the same content.
Is there anything else I should check ?
Regards,
Paul
