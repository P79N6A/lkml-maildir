Due to the timeout?  So it should come back after 10*num_online_cpus seconds?
Does Arjan have a lot of CPUs?

But what would a fix look like?  I think things would work OK if all the
appropriate stuff is present in initramfs, yes?  We wouldn't want to break
that.
hm.  kobject_uevent() stupidly returns void.  If we were to fix that, is
there any reason why _request_firmware() should still wait for ten seconds
if kobject_uevent() returned a synchronous error?  (ie:
__call_usermodehelper failed?)
Answer: yes.  That won't work because request_firmware() uses
call_usermodehelper(wait=0) (iirc this bad thing was done because of
deadlock problems which were hard to fix properly).
But all it not lost - because call_usermodehelper() will use CLONE_VFORK I
_think_ we can still work out whether the child thread successfully exec'ed
a new program.  It'd take a bit of hacking on the fork() code to make that
work though.
