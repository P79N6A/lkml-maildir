Using signals to communicate with kernel threads is rather baroque - we
have a range of less klunky ways of controlling kernel threads in-kernel.
The containers guys are going through converting lots of these things over
to the kthread API - I believe it's a requirement for containerisation.
nfsd/rpc is going to be one of the hard ones to convert, but it's going to
happen.
