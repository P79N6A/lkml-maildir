Wouldn't this mean that we try to set up the NMI stuff regardless of
forcing the timer ? I can imagine a flaky system where somebody needs to
avoid going near that stuff.
timer_init() making sure to set all fields seems reasonable to me.  Or
oprofile_init() could grab ->backtrace, memset the structure, then
replace ->backtrace...
