I have similar issue with:
floppy_init()
  floppy_grab_irq_and_dma()
    fd_request_irq()
      request_irq()
      floppy_hardint()
      ...
      floppy_hardint()
This causes interrupt storm, hanging the machine on bootup.  Booting with
pci=noacpi fixes this.  So, I'm assuming acpi pci irq routing problem.
This is irq 6, which ACPI is disabling.  Perhaps disabling leaves it in
a bogus state?
thanks,
