I upgraded to 2.4.2, and initially I couldn't reproduce the problem.
Besides the kernel version difference, another difference was the fact
that I did the 2.4.2. test on a freshly booted system, while the
2.4.2-pre4 test was done on a system with quite some VM pressure:
uptime a couple of days, running acroread, netscape, xemacs, couple of
gnome-terminals with large scroll back buffers (10000 lines).
John Adams told me that the data didn't hit the disk on his system and
that he had to add O_SYNC to the open()s. After I did that, I could
reproduce the problem on linux-2.4.2, with the strange results that the
bug is in *every* file with initial size >=1024 bytes.
John also told that his machine doesn't have swap, but I fail to see
why that could influence the reiserfs subsystem. Anyway, the bug seems
to appear when the data hits the disk, either by high VM pressure, or
by using O_SYNC.
