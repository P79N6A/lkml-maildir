A few. They're not in the mainstream kernel. Well, specificly:
	- the UDF fs is still sort of alpha - Ben's the dude here
	- most DVD-RAMs, instead of appearing as two SCSI LUNs, one
	  a CD-ROM and one a rewritable removable drive, appear
	  as one device; there're a few patchs floating about to make
	  the kernel recognise the vendor strings and make two entries.
	  I am using this approach happily with a Creative DVD-RAM.
Cheers,
