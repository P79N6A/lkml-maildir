Like I hinted at, you can't just "vet a page". Because a page alone is
meaningless garbage, unless it happens to be an extremely small program,
with headers, all nicely aligned. Most likely you don't know if a random
page of data is code from a COFF file, ELF file, or some random crap I
typed in at a terminal after having too much coffee.
So. You'd need to scan *all the pages* of *the entire file*, every time
that you performed any type of operation. Hence, that idea is completely
out right away. The on-access scanning isn't perfect, but it's probably
about as good as you can get and still have a reasonably usable system.
