Hi,
I'm following the latest releases of the 2.3-series to get my xircom 10/100 Mbit + 56Kbit modem working under a Toshiba Laptop.
It worked, but the kernel was not always that stable for normal use.
Now, I jumped from 2.3.49 to 2.3.51, but 2.3.51 does not boot anymore.
After LILO I get 'Loading 2.3.51' and then a blank screen.  This also happens with the .52-pre series and .99-pre1.  I compiled the kernel with egcs 2.95.2, using VESA framebuffer (but without it I get the same thing).  Does anybody have a clue what's going on?
I tried compiling with egcs 2.95.2 and pgcc 2.95.2 (you never know ...)
I used the standard optimizations, I tried compiling for P-II and for pentium.
I tried to disable VESA Framebuffer, ... the .99-pre1 I tried now was almost a basic kernel + PCMCIA-support in the kernel (cardbus).  Still the same thing: A blank screen.  There is not any letter that comes from the kernel itself that comes on my screen.  It does not continue (f.e. like it's only my screen that refueses to work) to load, there is no harddisk activity, nothing...  This is weird.
Anyway, for the interested, my .config (2.3.52-pre):
