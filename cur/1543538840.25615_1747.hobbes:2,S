	I'll see if I can whip that up for 2.4.0-testN...

	A root-owned daemon that has made sure to lock down
any memory it may need via mlock() won't have any swapping
issues. Running at nice -20, or even better, FIFO scheduling,
you can eat as much (or as little) of a timeslice from other 
apps as needed.
	With this basis, you can have all sorts of flavors
of the daemon that do kill processes randomly, ask the user for
which process to kill, have a list of ``you can kill any processes
but these....' or what have you.
	Actually, extending klogd to have a pluggable log-message-to-action
filter would be the best general case solution. Then, you could handle
missing floppies, automatic Ooops handling, whatever.
	Your thoughts?
