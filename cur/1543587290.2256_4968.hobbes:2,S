That's only if we want to do no better than the current system. We'd want
a new variable called timer_margin or something, which would be dependent
on interrupt source and processor, and could be tuned up or down via
sysctl.

Make that larger or smaller. If we come out of a quiescent state (1 hz
interrupts, say) and start getting 10ms timers, we want to respond to them
right away.

We could also have a HZ_max tunable above which we would not try to
reprogram the interval. On older systems, this could be set at
100-200HZ...
