Another couple of points.
1) Even with the two tasks sample the 15 % slodown is not evident 
	because the switching rate is statistically low.
2) My algo use the _same_ _sematics_ used by the old one but do it faster.
Probably You know better then me how many time schedule() is called in a 
Linux workstation ( system calls ).
Lowering the time the cpu execute schedule() is not as lowering user mode 
code because schedule() code is mostly interrupt protected.
This means a low speed in acknoledging IRQ and hence a worse system response 
to events.
This is all,
	Davide.
