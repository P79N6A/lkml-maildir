I think what Matt is saying is that certain functionality of the USB 
device is soft-coded. So once this data is gone from the device, trying 
to write to or from it will fail, since the read and write commands are 
(partially) soft-coded. If this is true, then writing to this device is 
like trying to ping a computer that was booted up, but had no operating 
system loaded. It would seem weird to create a device in such a manner, 
but it is not outside the realm of possibility.
I had a printer (hp lj1000) that operated in exactly this fashion. To 
work, its firmware needed to be cat'ed to the device before any printing 
was done. I never got this working and instead just returned the printer 
and replaced it with a postscript compliant model. I recommend that you 
do similar. No sense eating the cost. It will be impetus for the 
manufacturers to make robust and compatible devices.
