Well, all this depends on how the media has been formatted. From what I
heard (I have no exchangable drives since I sold my SyQuest crap), some
ZIP (presumably) media are partitioned and have their fourth partition
formatted, giving your data as /dev/hdd4 or /dev/sdb4 or something other
with 4 to the end. Then, the entire media might be formatted "raw" with
Linux, so you'd have to mount /dev/hdd instead.
The BIOS is only involved for booting and come APM or ACPI (power
saving) stuff, maybe also for VESA frame buffer stuff, but other than
that, its settings are partially read and the BIOS is no longer taken
into account.
Of course, a system hang is Not Nice[tm] and should be fixed by the
respective maintainers IF IT IS an actual bug. Please check the cabling
or use hdparm to use more conservative transfer modes before assuming
it's a bug with Linux -- a "cp" hang certainly warrants investigation.
OTOH, mount should not hang if you mount the wrong part of the disk, but
complain instead, however, I'm not sure if a bogus partition entry can
cause these hangs.
