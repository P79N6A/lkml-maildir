Someone posted a patch that should have fixed this (binding the control
connection to the data connection) and someone else posted a possible patch
to the patch. Unfortunately, I'm not familiar enough with the kernel to know
whether the original patch is fine as it stands, whether it needs the other
patch, or whether either of the two patches will make my machine explode and
kill my cat. Has anyone with much kernel masq experience checked these out
and/or sent them to Linus/Alan for inclusion in the next kernel? I'm having
the same problem with my masq box and am looking for a solution.
Thanks,
