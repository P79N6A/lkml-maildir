Hi
We have a Compaq server running RedHat Linux 6.2 with kernel 2.2.17
Once in a while we get errors like:
Nov 13 09:18:33 www2 kernel: VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for httpd... 
Nov 13 09:18:43 www2 kernel: VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for mysqld... 
The server then hangs and I have to cycle power to get it up and running
again.
Does anyone here know if 
  1. this is a known problem / bug?
  2. there is a patch available ?
  3. the problem is described anywhere else ?
