Or delete it from disk and include it in the kernel instead.
Having it in the kernel instead of as a sepperate file makes sense to
me; you'll never loose it as long as you have the actual kernel
around. Nothing like finding a problem with an older kernel and not
being able to duplicate the config with a newer one because you
deleted the .config at some point. With the config embedded in the
kernel that never happens...
As for the security issue with being able to read /proc/config.gz,
couldn't that be solved easily if that file had mode 0400 ?
