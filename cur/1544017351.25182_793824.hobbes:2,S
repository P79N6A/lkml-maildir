ah, indeed - tip/x86/setup-lzma is currently not in tip/master (due to a 
breakage that is being investigated), that's why i missed it.
So i took out the boot.h change from core/headers-fixes and your fix will 
take precedence.

those x86/header-fixes bits from you are in core/headers-fixes now:
 dbca1df: x86: headers cleanup - setup.h
 a7c4e68: x86: headers cleanup - sigcontext32.h
 4440270: x86: headers cleanup - prctl.h
So i think we are all sorted, agreed?
