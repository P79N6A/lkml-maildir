And you are ASSUMING the connection was authorized. I can assure you that 
there are about 200 (more or less) connections from the secure net to the
internet expressly for the purpose of transferring data from the internet
to the secure net for analysis. And not ALL of these connections are 
authorized. Some are done via sneakernet, others by running a cable ("I need
the data NOW... I'll just disconnect afterward..."), and are not visible
for very long. Other connections are by picking up a system and carrying it
from one connection to another (a version of sneakernet, though here it
sometimes needs a hand cart).
