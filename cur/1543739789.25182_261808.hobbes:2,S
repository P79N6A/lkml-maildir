Subject: [PATCH] change pagevec counters back to unsigned long and cacheline align

Change pagevec "nr" and "cold" back to "unsigned long", 
because 4 byte accesses can be slow on architectures < Pentium III 
(additional "data16" operand on instruction).
This still honours the cacheline alignment, making the size
of "pagevec" structure a power of two (either 64 or 128 bytes).
Haven't been able to see any significant change on performance on my 
limited testing.
