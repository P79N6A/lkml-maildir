Russell, the symbols are where the reference to an .init.text
section are coming from, they are not the .init.text function
being referenced itself.
It is saying that something between rest_init and run_init_processes,
which are not .init.text, are referencing an .init.text object.
It's unfortunate that the .init.text object being referenced for some
reason can't get the symbol printed out properly on ARM, it does get
printed out on other platforms, but once you fix that it will be very
easy for you to decode these messages.
But they are still useful.
The other one you posted was legitimate and as I explained just
needs an exception entry added to modpost.c
