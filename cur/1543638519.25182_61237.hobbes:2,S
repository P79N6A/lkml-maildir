I would like to see at least the identifiers named sanely
(is there already in the Linux kernel) and ALL the assumptions
documented with BUG_ON() or sth. like this.
The rest can be reconstructed by reading the source. But non-local 
assumptions are a nasty source for BUGs :-(

But it shouldn't be that easy, that Aunt Tillie starts submitting
feature patches without understanding the whole picture ;-)
PS: Trimmed CC a little, since these people are busy doing other
