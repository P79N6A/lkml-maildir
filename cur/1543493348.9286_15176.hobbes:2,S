You are simply blind to the huge flaws in your pet solution.
I only claim that the flaws in my solution are tolerable.

Daemons really aren't interesting. They are started in exactly one way
from exactly one place, without any worry about a hacked environment.
There are no untrusted ancestor processes to worry about.
Since daemons have such nice properties, I can execute them in any
odd way I please:
/sbin/usercap named NET_BIND_SERVICE /usr/sbin/named
That was very easy and quite boring.

You are brushing away some _serious_ problems. You would completely
throw away all hope of compatibility with everything.
You might as well in fact run NT. It has a capabilities system and it
includes filesystem support for security features. After all, you are
willing to throw away all UNIX compatibility.

You do get a choice between incomplete and ugly. You can embed UID info
in the executable if you wish.

All of the above are important options. Nothing is obviously the best.
Every admin should get to choose tradeoffs that are appropriate for
their local environment.
I could see running PGP-signed executables off of an otherwise untrusted
server when a more trusted server is unavailable.

I am serious. You are free to choose the zero option. Disabled features
don't interact very much.
BTW, the above is starting to look like FUD. Stick to the facts please.
