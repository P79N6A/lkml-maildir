Can you tell me when Linux actually does this?  I know in theory it can happen, but I've 
never seen it.  Does the code to implement moving of data from one physical page to 
another even exist in any version of Linux?
Also, what would be the point?  What reason would there be to move some data from one 
physical page to another, while keeping the same virtual address?
