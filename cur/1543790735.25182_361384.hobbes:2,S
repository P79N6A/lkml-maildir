I would prefer to let this live in -mm at least for a little while. 
Confirmation from AMD, Intel and VIA owners would be really nice, too. 
AMD and Intel might be a little bit hard to find.  I think Peter Anvin 
had an Intel ICH w/ RNG at one time...

None of this precludes having this stuff in userspace.
That said, I don't object to your code being an intermediate step.
