That is an invalid reason: There was no hardcoded device node previously
(it was using a dynamically assigned major).
The only tool I know which uses this device is "megarc" from LSI Logic.
This tool uses the char device /dev/megaraid0, which will be created
correctly when using my patch and udev (the recommended setup for Linux
2.6 systems). I have tested this and it works.
User-level applications should not rely on hardcoded device numbers in any
case, but should use the correct device from /dev or search for the device
they need in sysfs.
