Forget about EDID2 for now. No-one is actually shipping stuff that 
uses the extended EDID2 info blocks, since it was originally designed 
for the VESA PnD flat panel connectors, which flopped miserably. I 
have yet to see any device with EDID2 in it, and as such we have not 
yet written an EDID2 parser for our tools either ;-)
