Hi.
I hope this is not too off-topic for this list.  I have discovered
discrepancies between various Unix implementations and/or their
documentation, and the Single Unix Specification, concerning the
behavior of the connect() system call for blocking, stream, sockets,
when it is interrupted by a signal.  Rather than explain it all, I'll
refer you to the Web page I just wrote about this, namely <URL:
http://www.eleves.ens.fr:8080/home/madore/computers/connect-intr.html
>.
I believe that the behavior Linux uses is the best, but it seems to be
at odds with a literal reading of the Specification.  (Details and
explanations are on the page I've just mentioned.)  I'd like to know a
little more about this, e.g., how it was decided and by whom, and
when, and what arguments can be given to support it.
