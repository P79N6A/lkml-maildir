Um, please ask next time when you want to quote from a private 
discussion.
To put it in perspective: I meant here that stopping the em28xx 
development using GPL is a consideration, not to take em28xx hostage. 
My first point in that same discussion was this:
"hverkuil: - It is pointless to worry about what others might do with 
your GPL code. Anyone can take it at any time and who knows, they might 
succeed. Then again, they might not. In any case, it shouldn't be a 
reason to consider stopping."
The only people you are hurting by taking em28xx offline are the 
end-users and yourself, I'm sorry to say.
