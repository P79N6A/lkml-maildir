and this is exactly what i need. I will aggregate 3 or 4 ppp links w/ an
ISP (here we use those USRobotics modems, the ADSL/ASDL/ISDN/alikes are
coming but with a high cost (about US$ 200 one 64k link).
Maybe other approach i can do is make a filter-based w/ NAT eql, where
one device just send packets out and other receives packets in. This
will be a forced hack ("xunxo", as we call here), but maybe works. 
Is any trouble doing this? Like break tcp code?
But i really don't want do reinvent the wheel -- I know that eql does
this, and just want to have one version that runs in RH6.
