	Indeed.  It seems fairly clean to me - I was actually thinking
that the idea could be significantly enhanced such that get_queue instead
returns a pointer to a structure:
struct request_queue
{
	struct request		* current_request;
	request_fn_proc		* request_fn;
	make_request_fn		* merge_fn;
	spinlock_t		  io_request_lock;
	void                    * queuedata;
};
such that each queue has it's own queue head (obviously - this is
effectively all this structure contained before), function pointers for
requeust queueing, mergeing of new commands, a lock (to be used in place
of io_request_lock), and finally an abstract pointer that request_fn()
could use (for whatever purpose the actual queue handler wanted).
