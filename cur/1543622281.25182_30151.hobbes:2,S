Basically I lend toward your arguments. I think too that a bios based
detection is already right and then we have now the ide-skip kernel
parameter which is allowing to exclude a drive from handling by the 
linux ide driver anyway. And I think that 2.4.x and above don't run on
i386's anymore anyway.
