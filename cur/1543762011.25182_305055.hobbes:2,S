The stack usage in some files under drivers/net/wireless/hostap/ is
too high.
drivers/net/wireless/hostap/hostap_ioctl.c:
prism2_ioctl_giwaplist:
        struct sockaddr addr[IW_MAX_AP];
        struct iw_quality qual[IW_MAX_AP];
64 * (16 + 4) Bytes = 1280 Bytes
prism2_ioctl_ethtool:
        struct ethtool_drvinfo info = { ETHTOOL_GDRVINFO };
196 Bytes
__prism2_translate_scan:
        char buf[MAX_WPA_IE_LEN * 2 + 30];
(64 * 2) + 30 Bytes = 158 Bytes
drivers/net/wireless/hostap/hostap_cs.c:
prism2_config:
        cisparse_t parse;
        u_char buf[64];
        config_info_t conf;
The main offender seems to be "parse" (but I'm too lame counting how 
many bytes it's exactly) resulting in nearly 1 kB stack usage.
drivers/net/wireless/hostap/hostap_plx.c:
prism2_plx_check_cis:
#define CIS_MAX_LEN 256
        u8 cis[CIS_MAX_LEN];
256 Bytes
