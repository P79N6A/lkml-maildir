A "compatibility list" is going to be pretty big, and hard to keep up
to date.  My thinking is that keeping track of a few notable things
that don't work is easier than running after all the stuff that does.
Of course, if automation can be brought to bear, that might make
either one much easier, but I'm dubious, because "it doesn't work" is
a vague concept, and really ought to be researched some.
A third concept "look, these guys support Linux really well!" (not
just "ok, it works") might also be easy to do.
By the way, the concept is not really about punishing vendors, and I
don't want it to come off looking like that.  It's about "this piece
of hardware does not work with Linux".  Who knows, maybe the fault is
with the kernel maintainers:-)  It might be nice if that gave some
incentive to the manufacturers to help bring the driver up to speed,
though.

I'd be worried about people who are just irritated that their system
didn't work out of the box hitting a button to submit this
information.
I suppose some sort of vote system could be put in place so that the 1
guy who didn't get the hardware to work gets outvoted by the 10 who
did, but there is more incentive to hit the button when you are
irritated than when everything 'just worked'.

It's a wiki, so for now I think placing comments on the bottom of the
page would be sensible.  We'll see if and how it grows.

Excellent idea.
Thanks for your thoughts,
