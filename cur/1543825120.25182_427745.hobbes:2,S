dpc7146, hexium_orion and mxb don't match all PCI IDs, they only match
boards with zero as a board ID.  So they won't conflict with
non-broken boards that have valid subvendor IDs.  But they will
conflict with each other.
How may of these boards are broken and have zeroes in the
subvendor/subdevice fields?  Apparently some of the dpc7146f,
hexium_orion, mxb, and stradis boards are broken.  How many of the
boards supported by the generic saa7146 driver are broken the same
way?
Can't the stradis driver do the same thing as the other drivers and
explicitly match the broken zero subvendor id and the non-broken
subvendor IDs?
static struct pci_device_id pci_tbl[] = {
        {
         .vendor = PCI_VENDOR_ID_PHILIPS,
         .device = PCI_DEVICE_ID_PHILIPS_SAA7146,
         .subvendor = 0x0000,
         .subdevice = 0x0000,
         },
        {
         .vendor = PCI_VENDOR_ID_PHILIPS,
         .device = PCI_DEVICE_ID_PHILIPS_SAA7146,
         .subvendor = STRADIS_SUBVENDOR_ID,
         .subdevice = STRADIS_SUBDEVICE_ID,
         },
        { }
}
That would fix the problem for me and make it SEP. :-)
Can somebody with a SDM2xx stradis board mail me the output from
"lspci -vn" and I'll cobble together a patch that does this?
This still needs solving properly, but at least it makes it less of
a problem for people with non-broken hardware.
