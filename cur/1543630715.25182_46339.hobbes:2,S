I traced it down. The trouble exists since 2.4.19-pre4. Trond Myklebust 
touched the VFS in order to send dentry revalidation events to NFS. 
http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/789/2002/3/100/8078826/
But Trond's patch conflicts with almost all non-standard virtual or remote 
mount file systems (supermount, cdfs, ftpfs, and maybe autofs). I don't know 
if the cdfs oops I observed now for a while is related.
Is it possible to leave the VFS layer untouched? Or restrict the dentry 
revalidation to NFS and let other remote file systems coexist, i.e. without 
revalidation calls? 
Or is it recommended to write fixes for the file systems stated above, 
because they now have wrong assumptions about the VFS behavior? 
Anyway, while these questions arise, I request to remove Trond's patch since 
the patch changes too much for 2.4 stable kernel series.
Attached is a revert patch against 2.4.19-pre8 for Marcelo.
Thanks 
Jörg
