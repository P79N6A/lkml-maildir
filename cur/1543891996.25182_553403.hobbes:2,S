Subject: [PATCH 0/4] no MAX_ARG_PAGES
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch-set aims at removing the current limit on argv+env space aka.
MAX_ARG_PAGES.
The new mm is created before the binfmt code runs, the stack is placed at the
highest address supported by that architecture.
The argv+env data is then copied from the old mm into the new mm (which is
inactive at that time - this introduces some cache coherency issues).
Then we run the binfmt code, which will compute the final stack address. The
existing stack will be moved downwards (or upwards on PA-RISC) to the desired
place.
This 'trick' heavily relies on the MMU, so for no-MMU archs we stay with the
old approach.
Tested-on: i386, ia64, frv, parisc, ppc64, um, x86_64
Patches against: .22-rc4
-- 
Changes since last time:
 - fixed ia64
     ( va-space constraints )
 - fixed ia64 CONFIG_IA32_SUPPORT
     ( brown paper bags and more va-space constraints)
 - fixed powerpc
     ( address limit on stack extention )
 - removed audit_kill() in favour of audit_panic()
 - nicely spit out the patches
