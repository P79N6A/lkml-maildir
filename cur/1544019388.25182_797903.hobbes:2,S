This might take a while.  I can offer to put this driver in the staging
tree while you work on it if that would be helpful?
The way the staging tree works is that drivers are held in a separate
area (drivers/staging) in the linux kernel while they're being worked
on.  The driver can be installed by users while it's in the staging tree
(so made use of) but it will taint the kernel with a warning that it's
not of linux kernel quality yet.  Once we get an acceptable driver in
drivers/staging, I'll move it across to drivers/scsi and remove the
taint.
