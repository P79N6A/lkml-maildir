Hi,
there seems to be a number of issues regarding the above setup. Symptoms:
 - Directory listings of big (read: more than approx. 200 files)
    directories show up as empty in 95% of all cases
 - Requests fail randomly (5-10%)
No. 2 is especially annoying for cron jobs, because the problems seem to
persist over some time (about half an hour), then everything is back to
normal.
Any ideas what might be causing this?
   Simon
