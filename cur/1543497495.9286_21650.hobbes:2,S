That's correct: this is expected behaviour for Unix raw character
devices.  You are doing dma from memory to disk, so the application
needs to do the alignment normally done by the OS.

You might be talking to a device which cannot scatter-gather, or which
can scatter-gather only on block boundaries.  Remember that the
virtual memory is not going to be physically contiguous.

It will break the code, since there is absolutely no support anywhere
in the kernel for submitting an IO to a single disk block from a
scatter-gather buffer.
