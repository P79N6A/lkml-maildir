That's what you would expect: they will auto-negotiate full duplex, in the
same way they would negotiate 10 or 100 Mbit/sec.

No, that's not possible. They just automatically configured for the
best performance available - in this case, full duplex.

No, it would just prevent your card working. Large numbers of collisions
are normal during fast transfers across a hub.
