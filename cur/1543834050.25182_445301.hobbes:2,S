Why does the patch make it to linux-kernel-announce and the nice 
announcement, like this one, not? The short patch description is far 
more useful, since if it's to something I don't use I don't need to 
apply or examine it.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
