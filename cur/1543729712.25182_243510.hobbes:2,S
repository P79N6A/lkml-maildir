The highlights:
 nw   spin   rjct  lock & function
19.0% 81.0%    0%  dcache_lock
 3.3% 96.7%    0%    d_alloc+0x270
 2.7% 97.3%    0%    d_delete+0x40
18.3% 81.7%    0%    d_instantiate+0x90
 4.7% 95.3%    0%    d_move+0x60

19.1% 80.9%    0%    dput+0x40
10.5% 89.5%    0%    link_path_walk+0xef0
   0%  100%    0%    sys_getcwd+0x210
41.4% 58.6%    0%  rcu_state
61.3% 38.7%    0%    __rcu_process_callbacks+0x260
41.4% 58.6%    0%    rcu_check_quiescent_state+0xf0
So it looks like the dcache lock is the biggest problem on this system with 
this load.  And although the rcu stuff has improved tremendously for this 
system, it's still highly contended.
