hi *!
in order to compile 2.5.4[34], i had to add #include
<linux/netfilter_ipv4> to net/ipv4/raw.c, since it choked on
NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT being undefined in line 297.
since i've had this problem for two kernel releases now, i thought i'd
bring this to your attention.
regards,
jörn
(please cc: me on followups, the archive i'm using to read lkml lags
badly. thx.)
