I also have an A7V and both of my IBM IDE drives are connected to the
Promise controller, running in UDMA-5 mode. There hasn't been any
corruption on either of the drives that had to do with UDMA-5 mode.
And the ext2 bugs that 2.4 kernels had, have been fixed in the latest
versions.
What drive are you using? AFAIR, Andre Hedrick once said certain Maxtor
drives aren't quite safe with DMA.
