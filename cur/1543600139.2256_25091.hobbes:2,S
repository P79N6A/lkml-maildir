If you want only textmode, look at nvvgacon
http://www.arava.co.il/matan/misc/
this module enables text console on secondary nvidia cards. I think it
only works on riva128 now, but it should be easy to add support for tnt
and later. If you also want to use a second keyboard, There is also
ps2key, usb2key, to emulate a second console (from user space) with a
keyboard connected to usb or to ps/2 mouse port.
