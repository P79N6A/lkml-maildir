Yes but not home users with relatively new/bleeding edge hardware or
small projects writing for example a wifi driver or a security patch
or whatever without full time commitment to tracking kernel changes.
Enterprise products are suited for production servers,
school/government/companies desktops and not for "enthusiasts" or for
small kernel projects (they obviously cant write drivers or patches
for custom distro kernels). Those enthusiasts have to get mad with
performance regressions, new incompatibilities, new crashes etc.
My suggestion was to release a 2.6.X kernel every 6months reducing
kernel development fragmentation between different distros and giving
away stabler stuff.
