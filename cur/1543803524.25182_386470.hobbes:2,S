To do what you describe I would create a monitor mode device, switch 
channel, then destroy it.  All the time you leave the station device 
unchanged, though you probably need to disable it.  This may not be 
possible with all devices--i.e. for those that require different 
firmware to do monitoring you will be restricted to a single virtual 
device and/or operating mode.
