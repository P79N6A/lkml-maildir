I have an old DELL Latitude CPi233D laptop with this Neomagic card (from 
/proc/pci):
 VGA compatible controller: Neomagic Corporation NM2160 [MagicGraph 128XD] 
(rev 1).
      IRQ 11.
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.  Min Gnt=16.Max Lat=255.
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xf1000000 [0xf1ffffff].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xfde00000 [0xfdffffff].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xfdd00000 [0xfddfffff].
With 2.4.(18|19|20-preX) with the neofb driver, scrolling up in 
vim/less/man/ecc (in console, not in X) is dog slow, somthing like a 2/3 
lines in second. Scrolling down is fast.
The 2.5 kernel that I've tryed are 2.5.39 & 2.5.40.
With 2.5.39 the slowlyness issue has desapeared an everything works fine.
With 2.5.40 the only difference from 2.5.39 is that when shutting down the 
system, i get an oops from the nmfb driver, with more or less this message:
Danger danger! Oopsen imminent
MTRR setting reg 2
I tried compiling with & without preempt, with ACPI, with APM (after disabling 
ACPI) with the same results.
Sory for my poor english
Cheers,
Frederik Nosi
