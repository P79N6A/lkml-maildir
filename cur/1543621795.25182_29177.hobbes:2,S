Linux 2.5.4 with CONFIG_PNPBIOS=y and "pnpbios=off" oopses
in ahc_linux_isr() (or near there, according to the
System.map file).

Linux 2.5.4 with CONFIG_PNPBIOS=y and ("pnpbios=nores" or
"pnpbios=nocurr") dies with the same problem as posted in
the original email in this thread.
By changing only one config (to CONFIG_PNPBIOS=n), Linux 2.5.4
boots with no problems on this system.
