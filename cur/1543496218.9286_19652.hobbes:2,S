Hi all,
Anyone else have stability problems with 2.2.9?  I've had it die twice in
the past 12 hours under fairly light load (network traffic only, basically).  
I've gotten no errors, oopsen, etc.  It just completely dies.
This machine is basically a router.  It's a Cyrix 6x86MX with a pci ne2k, a
linksys tulip clone, an ide hard drive, cdrom, and zip, and that's about it.
It's been running linux on that hardware stabily for a couple of years until
it met 2.2.9 ;-).
later,
chris
