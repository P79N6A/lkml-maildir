i think i found the reason for the sawtooth: it's a bug in hardirq
redirection. In certain situations we can end up not waking up softirqd,
resulting in a random 0-1msec latency between hardirq arrival and
softirq execution. We dont see higher latencies because timer IRQs
always wake up softirqd which hides the bug to a certain degree.
I'll fix this in -Q8.
