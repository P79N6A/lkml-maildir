You probably mean gcc 2.95.1 :-). It might be nice to know that gcc 2.95.2
is expected to be released this weekend (but don't be surprised if it
doesn't).

The egcs team has taken over gcc development. See 
http://gcc.gnu.org/
 .

They want to make a better compiler. I think they also want world
domination, just like Linux wants ;-).

But that was already possible: gcc 2.95.x is just egcs 1.2 with another
name badge. If your program compiled with egcs 1.1.x, it will probably
compile with gcc 2.95.1. Personally I had only minor problems when I moved
from gcc 2.7.2.3 (and gcc 2.8.1) to gcc 2.95.1. The C++ compiler is
different because the C++ standard itself changed.

I don't know. AFAIK, the biggest problem is the strict aliasing check that
gives problems with Linux kernels, but using -fno-strict-aliasing solves
that. FYI: gcc 2.95.2 will default to compile without the strict alias
check, according to Jeffrey Law:

  Subject: gcc-2.95.2 vs strict aliasing
  This is an FYI, not an RFC -- I do not want to start another debate on the
  strict aliasing issue _as it applies to the upcoming GCC 2.95.2 release_.
  --
  I have changed the branch to not perform strict aliasing optimizations by
  default.  This is a tactical retreat to give us more time to continue sorting
  through the potential for warnings and avoiding optimization in cases where
  we can detect that a program is likely violating the aliasing rules.
  We will reevaluate the strict aliasing decision for future releases
  independently of the decision to disable them for the GCC 2.95.2 release.
