Ok, with just __rtl8169_set_mac_addr disabled it works. With netconsole 
disabled, and your phy_reset patch applied it seems to still work. The 
printk
+		printk(KERN_ERR "%s: PHY reset failed.\n", dev->name);
doesn't get printed. If I uncomment __rtl8169_set_mac_addr it stops 
working again. What does it tell us about the original set_mac_address 
problem?
I haven't said it's an on-board chip, not a plug-in card. Don't know how 
setting the mac address worked in your configuration, but if it is storred 
in a prom, maybe it is just missing on my board?
The kernel is not 2.6.19-rc3 either. It is a clone of the powerpc git some 
time shortly after 2.6.19-rc2.
Thanks
