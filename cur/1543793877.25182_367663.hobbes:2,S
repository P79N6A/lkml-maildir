Uhh, this patch doesn't introduce any kind of virtualization yet.    
When that happens, _this_ code will remain the same (it wants the  
real pid), but *other* code will switch to use task_vpid(current)  
instead.  This is an extremely literal translation of current->pid to  
task_pid(current), both of which do exactly the same thing.

There is no way to make Linux robust with unreliable memory  
subsystems, sorry.  It would be like trying to make a human more  
robust with an unreliable O2 supply. Memory just has to work.
