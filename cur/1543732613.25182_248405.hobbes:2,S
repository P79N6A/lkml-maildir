I've occasionally had the need to search all files on my system for
the one file which contains a particular phrase -- all I remember is
the phrase.
Just doing "grep -R" was a tedious job: at least half an hour.
Sometimes, I want to search all source files on my system for a
particular word, for example to search for uses of a particular system
call or library function.
That would require something that could search through all the .tar.gz
files and .zip files (nested if necessary) as well as plain files.  It
would take so long -- hours at least, maybe more than a day -- that
I've never bothered doing such a thing.
"find "that entered archives really wouldn't help (although sometimes
"locate" that entered archives would be nice).
In other words, I'd use that capability if it was magically fast, but
as we expect it to be insanely slow (just grepping gigabytes is slow)
that makes it not so useful.
However, if we ever see that search engine index thing happen, it
would be a most excellent capability if it searched inside archive
files too.  I would definitely use that.  Not often, but occasionally I would.
