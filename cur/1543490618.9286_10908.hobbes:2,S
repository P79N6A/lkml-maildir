These days I am receiving 2/3 spam per day privately. I save _all_ the
spam in a folder.
andrea@laser:~$ ls -ls mail/spam
 644 -rw-------   1 andrea   andrea     654595 Mar 22 15:42 mail/spam
andrea@laser:~$ ls -ls mail/spam.gz

Just to produce some number since 3 Jan I got >600kbyte of pure spam. This
number exclude the spam I receive via mailing-lists.
