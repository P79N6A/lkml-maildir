OK, let's go a step further - what if syslog dies or breaks in some way
shape or form so that the syslog() function blocks...?
My worry is the one that was originally raised but ignored:  syslog() should
not BLOCK regardless of whether it's local or remote.  syslog is not a
reliable mechanism and many programs have been written assuming they can
fire off syslog() calls without worry.

      The truth is the truth, and opinion just opinion.  But what is what?
