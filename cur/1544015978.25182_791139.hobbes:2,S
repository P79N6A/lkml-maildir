There's something funny in this tree.   In changeset
19f0a391bf9d88307e52557ff3125b24e2519bd4 there is
a removal of arch/arm/mach-integrator/clock.h
I think when you installed that commit something
automatically deleted zero length files it found,
but that's just a guess.
Please fix this up so I can pull from you.
Otherwise all of those changes looked fine.
