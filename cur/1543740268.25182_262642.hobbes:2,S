I searched for the code in the scitech FTP server... If this code is 
similar to the one found under "../obsolete/.." then it seems that the 
code is somewhat optimized for speed, whereas for video initialization 
we probably could rework it to be optimized for code size.
If the complete interpreter could fit in 64k (or something like that) 
then the chances of it getting into the kernel would be probably higher 
and could solve a lot of problems.
This is a problem I find somewhat interesting, and would be willing to 
give it some of my spare time...

P.S. Aren't there other uses for a in-kernel x86 interpreter?
