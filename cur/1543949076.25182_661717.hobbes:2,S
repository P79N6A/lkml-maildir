Sure I started the discussion but I suppose you missed Andi's and other 
replies. All I said that people should think twice before relying on it.
btw I'm ok if I _am_ the _one_ who has to convert those pieces of code, that's 
part of the fun :). But if people keep adding stuff which uses stom_machine 
that may be pretty difficult :).
btw Being an RT guy you do not think that stop machine is evil ? I mean from 
the overhead and especially latency perspective. By overhead I mean if you 
have 100+ cpu box that Paul and other guys have mentioned here. Every single 
CPU has to be frozen. You said it's reasonably fast. I guess it depends what's 
reasonable. And from the latency perspective all bets are off. We have no 
guaranties whatsoever as to hold long it will take for cpu X to get frozen 
(there numerous factors here) and all the other cpus have to wait for it.
As I said for some things there is just no other way but to use the 
stop_machine but we should try to minimize that as much as possible.
