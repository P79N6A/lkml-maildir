i'd be glad to test any patch. Note, the config was generated via 'make 
randconfig', for automated build and boot QA, and "working SCTP" is not 
something that is necessary for such a kernel to boot. So the workaround 
might be fine as well - not all config space combinations that are 
reachable via 'make randconfig' make "sense", but they should still 
build and boot fine.
