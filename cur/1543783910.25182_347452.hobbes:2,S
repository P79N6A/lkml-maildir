I understand this. My point is that the structures are *not*
dynamic-tick specific. They are interrupt source specific, generally
(also known as hardware timers) -- dynamic tick or NO_IDLE_HZ are the
users of the interrupt source reprogramming functions, but not the
reprogrammers themselves, in my mind. Also, it still would be confusing
to use dynamic-tick, when the .config option is NO_IDLE_HZ! :)

I messed with this with my soft-timer rework (which has since has fallen
by the wayside). It is a bit of overhead, especially del_timer(), but
it's possible. This is what I would consider "dynamic-tick." And I would
setup a *different* .config option to enable it. Perhaps depending on
CONFIG_NO_IDLE_HZ.

Yes, true, it does enable that. Well, to be honest, it completely
redefines (in some sense) the jiffy, as it is potentially continuously
changing, not just at idle times.

I'm not trying to limit the name, but make sure we are tying the
strcutures and functions to the right abstraction (interrupt source, in
my opinion).
Thanks,
