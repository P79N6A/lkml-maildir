Hmm, KMix doesn't do either, but if I mute the main volume and
restart KMix, it will come up unmuted, but the volume set to
zero.
Other mixers (XMixer, aumix) don't seem know of the concept of
muting at all. (And switching input sources doesn't seem to
have much effect on what gets sent to the speakers.)
Also, a quick grep through linux-*/sound/ doesn't find the
word "mute". Are you sure this isn't a feature of the mixer
instead of the sound API ?
