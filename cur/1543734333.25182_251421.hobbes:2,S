Well, it looks like things blindly move to the next bitmap block and
don't check that the offset within it is valid, so the patch below
(not runtime or compile-time tested) may help. It relies on
next_free_map() returning NULL after having cycled through enough of
the bitmap blocks.

The /proc/ code is rather messy around this area so I don't have any
immediate ideas there.
