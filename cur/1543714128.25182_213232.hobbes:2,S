After a quick googling:
http://www.advogato.org/person/scandal/
According to this link, the wlan-ng drivers suffer a similar fate as
several other wireless drivers (e.g. HostAP) as they allow for
driver-based (as opposed to firmware-based) WEP encryption and
decryption.
Fortunately, the recent inclusion of the ARC4 module (by yours truly) in
the crypto API will allow these wireless drivers to use this
driver-based WEP and still be included in the kernel.  The Michael MIC
cipher was also recently included by HostAP to be used with TKIP.
I have CC'ed this to the linux-wlan guys in case they're not aware of
this development.
