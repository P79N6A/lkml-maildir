Hi,
Linux-2.5.5-pre1 reintroduces this old problem for me again after it had been
ok with 2.5.3-final. Some interesting information that might help track down
what's causing it.
The problem only happens when the following bit of rc.local is executed upon
startup with 2.5.5-pre1. 2.5.3 is fine.
if [ -x /opt/dnetc/dnetc ]; then
  su nobody -c /opt/dnetc/dnetc 1>/dev/tty7 2>&1 &
fi
There is no getty or anything running on tty7.
Additionally the system load as shown by w, uptime, etc. is the normal load
plus 100%. However, ps, top etc. don't show any processes causing load.
-Udo.
