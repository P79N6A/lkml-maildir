Yes.  Something scribbled on the pagecache, most likely.
If this happens, take a copy of the offending binary and all its shared
libraries - simply copy them into a temp directory.  The corrupted version
will be written to disk, from the pagecache.  Make sure you keep
a copy of the offending vmlinux as well for looking things up in.
Then reboot and start diffing things; the differences can provide
clues.  If the diffs show single-bit errors then it's a RAM
problem.  If the diffs look like pointers into kernel space
then look 'em up in vmlinux and shout loudly.  etc.
