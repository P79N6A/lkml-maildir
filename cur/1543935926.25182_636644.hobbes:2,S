I know that it's not popular to care about the kernel size, but your 
patch will cost precious memory in the common case of UP embedded 
systems with CONFIG_PM=y.
It seems the correct solution would be not to hijack __cpuinit
(as your patch does), but to create a new annotation.

BTW: Is there any good reason why your patch is x86 only?
     No matter how this gets handled, it should be an architecture 
     independent issue.
