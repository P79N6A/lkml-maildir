I suspect a call to panic would be more appropriate there.
I actually missed this one as I generated the patches against
Linus's latest tree.
Are we in process context where we can afford to do a clean shutdown
of the machine?  I would have expected an error handling path to
not be able to do better than emergency_restart. 
Regardless a panic sounds much more appropriate and will let the action
taken depend on the users policy.
