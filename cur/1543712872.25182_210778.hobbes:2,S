The short answer is that programs (like xsane or scanimage) generally
shouldn't be using the SETCONFIGURATION call.  The program should be 
fixed.
The longer answer is that several patches have been submitted in the last 
week that touch on this and other related problems.  They may appear in 
2.6.5-rc4 or later.
