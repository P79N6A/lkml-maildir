Does that mean "in kernel space", "in the kernel distribution" or "in 
memory completely under the control by the kernel?"  That is really what 
this is about.
There could be a klibc-build binary in rootfs, build at the time the 
kernel was built, that can be invoked by the kernel in parallel with 
/sbin/hotplug.

The whole point of putting klibc in the kernel tree is so we can do this 
kind of stuff without breaking the stock kernel build as a 
self-contained entity.  Without that objective, Olaf is right that it is 
not necessary.
