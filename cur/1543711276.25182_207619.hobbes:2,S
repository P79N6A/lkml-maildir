Yes, the x86-64 64bit vsyscalls predate all the vDSO work and haven't
been updated. It has a vDSO for 32bit programs though.
I guess it would be not that much work to add it for 64bit too. 
I would not be opposed to it if somebody sends me patches. 
This means my only objection is that an dwarf2 unwind table written
without the .cfi_* support in the assembler is incredibly ugly and
unmaintainable. I really don't want to have more such ugly tables.  I
guess it would be best to force an binutils update for dwarf2
information.
