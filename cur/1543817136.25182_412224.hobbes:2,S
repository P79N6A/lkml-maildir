The issue me actually be a driver interrupt locking bug.  The driver  
supports three distinct interrupts for TX, RX, Error.  I asked Emin  
to try changing the driver to use SA_INTERRUPT in the request_irq()  
to see what happens.  I believe that when he did that it worked but  
hurts performance.
