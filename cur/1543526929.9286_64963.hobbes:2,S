That's not quite correct.  The mantra of F_SETSIG is that you never ever
have to do anything unscalable like polling on every fd you have open
when only a few have activity.  The poll() you describe above is a
single non-blocking poll on one single fd, which doesn't have the
scalability problems inherent in making your whole event loop revolve
around poll().

Agreed.
