AFAICT, per 
http://www.yamahayst.com/pcaudio/downloads_body.htm,
 the 
DS-1x series (YMF724, YMF740, YMF744, YMF754) use the same driver.
Looks like the datasheet at
http://www.yamahayst.com/pcaudio/download/index.htm
 for the YMF-754 should
provide enough info to make the SBPro playback-only emulation go.  Support
for the other nifty features (digital in/out, etc.) shall come when Yamaha
acquires a clue.  Heck-- even their motorcycle line needs rethinking.
