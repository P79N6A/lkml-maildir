One thing that I've noticed with devfs is that all the old-style names are
symlinks.  Documentation/filesystems/devfs/README, I think is the file
that describes this.  The actual device file for /dev/hda now is:
/dev/ide/hd/c0b0t0u0
OR
/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/disc
I use the shorter one in my fstab, it makes things neater.  It's also a
symlink, but I would think that symlink will stay longer than /dev/hda
will, anyway.  When I rebuild my system, or get a completely new one,
everything will probably wind up using /dev/ide/host0... etc.

Everything is modularized here, including ppp and such, and modprobe is
loading everything quite nicely for me.  I don't like to run one big
kernel, it wastes too much memory, and so I use pretty much *everything*
that I can in modules (IDE I can't, because I boot from IDE, but I leave
SCSI in a module, becuase I use ide-scsi to burn my CDs and it's not
*reqired*).

I can't help you much more than what I've already said, but best of wishes
and luck to you.  I would advise that you traverse through /dev/ though,
and find out how the new organization is... it's *quite* different from
the old method.  The symlinks are only there for backwards compatability
for the time being - however, I'd expect those to be moved out when pretty
much all Linux software is using the new arrangement.
