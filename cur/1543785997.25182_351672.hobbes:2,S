Ah, in that case I agree: we have nothing to worry about by merging

Thanks for the confirmation Ingo. This is part of my "cleanup resched
and cpu_idle" patch FYI. It should already be in -mm, but has some
trivial EM64T bug in it that Andrew hits but I can't reproduce.
I'll dust it off and send it out, hopefully someone will be able to
reproduce the problem!
