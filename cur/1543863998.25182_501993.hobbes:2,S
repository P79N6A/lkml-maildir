You mentioned this is the reason for the spi_get_exclusive-patch
you sent privately (thanks).  I hadn't seen that, and from my
reading of the standard I read "bus transaction" (their wording
for what's between cs deactivation) as a single byte or at least
send and reply part of a command as separate "bus transactions".
Yeah, there's only one SPI device on my bus.  To simulate other
devices on the bus, chatting along when the SD/MMC SPI device
has chip-select inactive, I experimented with sending "random"
stuff while in the chip-select function like so:
(in chip_select_function at the end, added)
...
        if (value != BITBANG_CS_ACTIVE)
                send_random(spi);
}
void send_random(struct spi_device *spi)
{
        u8 buf[256];
        int i;
        static int value = 0;
        static int n = 0;
        struct spi_transfer t;
        memset (&t, 0, sizeof t);
        t.tx_buf = buf;
        t.len = ++n;
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
                buf[i] = value++;
        if (crisv32_spi_sser_dma_txrx_bufs(spi, &t) != n)
                panic ("badness\n");
        if (n == sizeof buf)
                n = 1;
}
... and *now* I see it. ;-) No card works.  Hm.  Modulo bugs in
the above, I agree you need that claim-stuff if there's more
than one device.  Still, I guess that's actually a rare
configuration.

That's for read.  For write, it's until the 0x0 bytes stop.  But
this is a performance feature, not critical for basic function.

I retract this patch and suggestion, given your later
suggestion.  (Not worthwhile as a feature.)

Not all are important as long as mmc_spi provides fallback
solutions, or what works all the time with some cards.

Let me rephrase: some controllers (yes, they are using the
bitbang framework but that's beside the point) do not deactivate
chip-select; they may not have that signal programmable.
Therefore, some are using SPI as if chip-select is an optional
part of the function, so maybe it should be left as that.
