Hi guys,
A long time ago I noticed a curious feature on my Dell Latitude CPx 
H-450GT laptop - rebooting it via "shutdown -r now" (and therefore going
through BIOS) does not discard the microcode applied to the CPU. But I
would expect it to be discarded as prescribed by Intel manuals, on #RESET.
Does it mean that rebooting a laptop does not actually ever reset the
CPU? (this would imply that the BIOS is also a protected mode software?)
Of course, doing "shutdown -h now" and switching off the power does
discard the microcode as expected.
Any thoughts? I post on linux-kernel because, potentially, your thoughts
may become relevant to the content of arch/i386/kernel/microcode.c which
is part of Linux kernel :)
Regards,
Tigran
