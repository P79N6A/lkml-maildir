This used to work on the older systems.  Newer systems that use PCI bridge
circuitry don't let you do this because you form a local ground loop when
you short the pins, and they've got pull up and pull down logic that will
shunt the signal (the system sees it as a short and not an NMI) .  Even NMI
cards won't work on most systems newer than about 96 that use the newer
Intel design.
Good luck.
Jeff
