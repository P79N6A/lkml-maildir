Sure.

Yes, it's a little nicer than my second variant. But it's still more
complicated than the first one and I'm not sure if doing that is worth it

... as we lose 4 bytes here (currently the union of structs in ifreq
is limited to 16 bytes)

What might be actually better than my first variant, is a variable-length
data:
struct ifreq {
        char name[16];
        union {
                ...
                struct {
                        int sub_command;
                        int data_length;
                        void *data;
                }
        }ifru;
}
... while "data" would be fr_protocol, eth_physical etc.
It's (of course) more complicated, but there is a gain:
- we can have different size requests (from 0 bytes to, say, 100KB)
- we split SIOC namespace into domains
- the core ioctl handler can still "verify" data area for the underlying
  driver
