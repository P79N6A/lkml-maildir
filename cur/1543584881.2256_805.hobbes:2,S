Can you do the following:
ls -i (path)/imlib1; ls -i (path)/fd         # record inode numbers
debugfs /dev/hdX
stat <inode_number>                          # '<' and '>' are required
send output.  This should tell us if the badness is stored on disk or in
memory.  Of course e2fsck would help as well.  Were these newly created
inodes, or existing ones?  If you shutdown and restart, does it go away?
Anything in syslog about ext2 warnings or errors?
Cheers, Andreas
