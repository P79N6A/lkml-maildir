Looking at 2.6.0-test11, it seems that its struct inode has such a
field, albeit named i_writecount.  Commentary from fs/namei.c:
/*
 * get_write_access() gets write permission for a file.
 * put_write_access() releases this write permission.
 * This is used for regular files.
 * We cannot support write (and maybe mmap read-write shared) accesses and
 * MAP_DENYWRITE mmappings simultaneously. The i_writecount field of an inode
 * can have the following values:
 * 0: no writers, no VM_DENYWRITE mappings
 * < 0: (-i_writecount) vm_area_structs with VM_DENYWRITE set exist
 * > 0: (i_writecount) users are writing to the file.
 *
 * Normally we operate on that counter with atomic_{inc,dec} and it's safe
 * except for the cases where we don't hold i_writecount yet. Then we need to
 * use {get,deny}_write_access() - these functions check the sign and refuse
 * to do the change if sign is wrong. Exclusion between them is provided by
 * spinlock (arbitration_lock) and I'll rip the second arsehole to the first
 * who will try to move it in struct inode - just leave it here.
