I got the followings with tip/master:
drivers/pci/probe.c: In function 'pci_bus_show_cpuaffinity':
drivers/pci/probe.c:56: error: implicit declaration of function 'cpumask_from_node'
drivers/pci/probe.c:56: warning: pointer/integer type mismatch in conditional expression
make[3]: *** [drivers/pci/probe.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [drivers/pci] Error 2
it's due to the typo in arch/ia64/include/asm/topology.h, I guess.
