Before the change /proc/tty/drivers shows this:
[jonsmirl@jonsmirl ~]$ cat /proc/tty/drivers
/dev/tty             /dev/tty        5       0 system:/dev/tty

/dev/vc/0            /dev/vc/0       4       0 system:vtmaster
serial               /dev/ttyS       4 64-67 serial
pty_slave            /dev/pts      136 0-1048575 pty:slave
pty_master           /dev/ptm      128 0-1048575 pty:master

I changed it to this which better reflects my system.
[jonsmirl@jonsmirl ~]$ cat /proc/tty/drivers
/dev/tty             /dev/tty        5       0 system:/dev/tty

/dev/tty0            /dev/tty0       4       0 system:vtmaster
serial               /dev/ttyS       4 64-67 serial
pty_slave            /dev/pts      136 0-1048575 pty:slave

Nothing in that patch has anything to do with udev support. It is just
trying to make things match my current devices. When we got rid of
devfs /dev/vc/0 became /dev/tty0.
The ttyp change was a mistake. The patch below removes that error. Is
there anything else wrong with it? That's why we have patch reviews,
to catch dumb errors like that.

If I use udev to rename my devices, the names aren't going to match
/proc/tty and what ps shows. The idea behind udev is that the kernel
only deals in device numbers and all naming happens in user space.
