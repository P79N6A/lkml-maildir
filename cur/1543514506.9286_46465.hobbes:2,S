Just a day or two ago I compiled Kernel v2.3.23, and when the init
scripts tried to mount my vfat HD, an error message aboutr vfat not
being supported was returned. When I tried it from the commandline, I
got a message about unresolved symbols. I don't remember any actual
specific symbols being mentioned, just unresolved symbols.
Also a problem, since about 2.3.21(The first new kernel I have been able
to use since 2.3.5) is that when I try to mount a smb mount, I get a
message about "no such device", and the mount failed.
Suggestions for either one of these???
