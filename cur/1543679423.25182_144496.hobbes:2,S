Great thanks. I'll try my best to leave it alone for a while now and let 
others test it (no 1000Hz alone does not fix this problem).
I'll leave the latest available O1int patch here:
http://kernel.kolivas.org/2.5
for downloading and remind people that if you use the -mm tree you will see 
better performance if you reverse patch the 100Hz patch, but it still should 
benefit at 100Hz.
