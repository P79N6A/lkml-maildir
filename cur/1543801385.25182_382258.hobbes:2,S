config MODE_TT
        bool "Tracing thread support"
        default y
        help
        This option controls whether tracing thread support is compiled
        into UML.  Normally, this should be set to Y.  If you intend to
        use only skas mode (and the host has the skas patch applied to it),
        then it is OK to say N here.
Then I unfortunately do not quite understand what this is for.
