Definitelly. I have similar issues with pmacs, clocks generation
and interrupt controller are in Apple's mac-io ASIC which is on PCI,
so this ASIC can't be part of the normal PM tree and has to be handled
as part of the "core" PM code. This kind of issue will still happen, the
new scheme won't "magically" make PM work on every single laptop out
there, there will still be some corner cases to deal with, but at least
these will be limited to real corner cases and most "normal" drivers
will fit in the new, saner, mecanism.
Ben.
