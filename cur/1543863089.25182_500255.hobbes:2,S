Hello,
This is the third iteration of devres patchset.  Changes from the last
take[L] are...
* devres patches collapsed into one as Jeff requested
* updates for sata_inic162x added
* rebased to the current upstream
Git tree is available at the following URLs.
  
http://htj.dyndns.org/git/?p=libata-tj.git;a=shortlog;h=devres
  git://htj.dyndns.org/libata-tj devres
For detailed info, please read Documentation/driver-model/devres.txt.
Similar info can also be found from the initial take[I].
This patchset is against
[U]   libata-dev#upstream
[1] + sata_promise-kill-qc-nsect

The git tree contains both previous patches, but this patchset apply
