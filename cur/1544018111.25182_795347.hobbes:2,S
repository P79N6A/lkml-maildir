While this patch was indeed broken, generally for -tip patches we are very 
permissive and do not require testing 4 .config variants: compile testing 
on the bit width x86 variant that is being modified is enough. If both 
variant are modified (as in this case) then compiling the 32-bit and 
64-bit defconfig is enough.
If some build failure slips through it will be handled by automated 
testing facilities (such as -tip's testing) - it really does not scale if 
we expect developers to build kernels they dont use (and dont care about 
nearly as much as about their primary config).
This lowers the bar of entry to developers who submit their patches from 
low-powered hardware and simply dont have the means to do wide build 
testing. The many .config variations are not really the developer's fault 
but our collective fault. Developers should spend their time thinking 
about patches, not waiting for the nth kernel build to finish.
