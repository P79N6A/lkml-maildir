Testing the new pre6 kernel I found out some oddities:
- I'm missing a scrollbar in the main window of xconfig.
  My screen 1024x768 is not nig enough for the whole menu 
  and there are no scrollers to help. Just <next> in each menu... :(
- ATA2/Support help has a wrong topic 
- saying no to modules don't disables the < >m option in all menues
- QIC-o2 tape support under mice section. why?
- so as the watchdog support. why?
Could someone with more TCL/TC experience fixe this, please?
Ralf
