It isn't. The default vendor is "unknown". When the processor(s) are
tested, the characteristics are checked and the vendors are then usually
identified.
Here is the default....
processor	: 0
cpu		: 486
model		: unknown
vendor_id	: unknown
stepping	: unknown
fdiv_bug	: no
hlt_bug		: no
fpu		: yes
fpu_exception	: yes
cpuid		: no
wp		: yes
flags		:
bogomips	: 33.28
FYI. This is an actual machine, a 486-DX/66. The CPU is marked green,
but is disowned by Cyrix.
If your message is flame-bait, forget it. It would be called a
GenuineCyrix if it was.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
