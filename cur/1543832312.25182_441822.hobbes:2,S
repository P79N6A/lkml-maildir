Some architectures like ours can run with a single zone since they have 
DMA that works anywhere. Same thing is true for my machines are home and 
at work.

The problem is that the zones are not even empty! We keep 16M in some 
weird ZONE_DMA that barely anyone one uses anymore and add slabs to it 
that are only used by some confused device drivers.
Also the empty zones are still a problem since they have to be scanned 
repeatedly (potentially on each allocation). They waste cachelines and 
result in loops where we could just have straight code.
