Oh thats certainly a good option as well, there are two other ways as
well a) list hot plug devices as "unknown or plugged in post boot" b)
make the PCI table a loadable module that is loaded by the hot plug
code, the device description is extracted from the big list and put in
the /proc/pci list and the module unloaded again.
b) may sound a bit silly, but since you are unlikely to replace PCI
hot-plug devices at a rate of 10000 devices/second, it is actually
quite feasible.
Anyway I agree with Ted, this discussion is basically a "storm in a
glass of water" (as we say in Danish).
