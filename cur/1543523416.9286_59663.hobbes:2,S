2.2.13 vs 2.2.15pre4
laptop AMD K6/2-333 128MB Memory
I run mpg123 almost all the time in the background. I don't generally
experience any clicks in the music except when I am running a
backup script of mine.  The backup script does a tar and pipes the
archive to pgp and the result is delivered over the network to
another machine.
With 2.2.13 I got the occasional click in the audio when the
backup was going on.  I never noticed any other manifestation of
the "delay".
With 2.2.15pre4 the click occurs and seems to be more like a 0.35 second
pause rather than a click.  I also noticed in my VI sessions the
sessions stops for the duration of the pause.  I had never noticed 
VI pause before.  
I just ran the script again, and the click/noticable pause occured
twice while typing this line.
I don't do anything with niceness.  Everything is running with
whatever niceness the system assigned by default.  Click/paused
2 more times.
