I seem to recall that Andrea identified reasons why per-user mlock limits
were fundamentally broken/unsuitable, but I forget the details.  Perhaps he
could remind us?
As for this patch: it's a new capability which will get basically zero
testing for the next year, which is a worry.  How have you tested it, and
how much?
