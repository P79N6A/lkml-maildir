Hi all,
  i am using this patch for the first time and i am reporting my experience.
   Before this patch with all the programs i usually keep running 
(opera/iceweasel with lots of tabs, icedove mail client, konversation 
irc client, akregator feed reader, and the super-hog second life client, 
vim, among others) the reponse was a bit slugish (waiting for program 
focus, wait for redrawing specially when i change from one virtual 
desktop to another).
   After I started using this patch the response/interactivity seems 
improved and faster, i never used Linux so responsive as now. I can 
switch between virtual desktops with immediate response. Even with a 
load of 2.0 (now, while i am writing this) thse system it's very 
responsive and the audio and video still work without glitches.
Just for the record, and if it matters i am using it on a laptop with a 
T2500 CPU, 1 GB RAM.
If there's any way i can help, providing data, running any kind of 
benchmark to quantify the beahaviour, etc... please ask.
Thanks all who made/tested this patch. Good work. Thanks.
