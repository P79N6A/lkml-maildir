I've found that hci_usb also hogs power on the Macbook; blacklisting this 
module cuts down HZ considerably. I also found appletouch consumed ticks, 
just as you did.
uhci_hcd then drops to noise; my Macbook's sitting on 10W with the backlight 
on minimum, which is about what it can manage in OS X on maximum life 
settings.
