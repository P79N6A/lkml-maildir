I have a dual Athlon MP system with Tyan S2466N4 Motherboard. It looks
more of a problem with the interrupt controller.  I downloaded -17 and
tried that, but now it hangs on starting up cups and the last message
from the kernel is:
lp0: using parport0 (interrupt-driven).
It looks like a pretty bad lock up, since I know exactly when it happens
since the cursor stops blinking.
I'm right now compiling the PREEMPT_DESKTOP kernel to see if that gives
me the same problems.
