Which is dead wrong. A short test program here (Fedora rawhide, i686,
gcc-4.0.0) shows that if you use an array, it is allocated on the stack and
the contents of the (constant, readonly) string is copied there before use,
just as you'd have to expect given C's semantics. I.e., the function gets
larger, slower, and uses more stack. If the array is declared const makes
no difference (AFAIR, it can't, as the const doesn't guarantee it won't be
changed).
