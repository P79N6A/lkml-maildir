i was building a windows machine (yah booh sucks) for a client and i got a P5A
would it work - would it hell
got them another motherboard (smicro if i recall) and all was well
i kept the P5A - not sure why
i've just put linux on it and it is rock solid
same basic config
p5a, K6-ii/350, 128M SDRAM DIMM, Maxtor drive
you know, i suspect that a lot of the flakiness that is attributed 
to microsoft could quite possibly be flaky hardware
