Any suggestion on what BLKBSZGET should return?
1) blocksize = 0 (same as it does already for most devices)
2) return -EINVAL
3) same as BLKSSZGET
4) return -ENOTTY
It probably doesn't matter much as any user of BLKBSZGET is
already broken, but it would be good to do the right thing
since it is a documented interface.
