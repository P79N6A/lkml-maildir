IS_ERR(ptr) and PTR_ERR(ptr) would also yield some interesting bizarre
errors if the last page (last 1000 bytes in the current implementation
of IS_ERR) were valid!

Yes ... rounding 'end' up to pmd/pud/pgd boundaries can certainly
wrap around to zero ... giving up the last page of address space
seems reasonable.  Giving up the last PGD_SIZE just to make some
math a bit easier sounds like overkill.
