Ted,
Thanks for your suggestions and help.
We started it from 2.6.7 last year and then it was sitting idle for several 
months for lack of resources. We'll go back to that version and generate a 
diff that's easier to read.
Yes, changing the name has made the task of rebasing wrt. changing kernels lot 
difficult. Our original intention was to make testing easier by keeping ext3 
and checkfs filesystems in the same kernel. Had we continued it at that 
point, we would have posted differences wrt. ext3 sources themselves. There 
was compelling reason to change the name.
Regards.
