Well, Linux *does* use it, but the partition table format and the
bootstrap requires CHS addressing, unfortunately; there isn't much we
can do about it, although some newer BIOSes support an LBA API.  I was
working on an ext2-aware boot loader which would also be able to use
the LBA API; I ran into some issues with Linux itself that got me
stalled a bit unfortunately (ext2 reserves inode 5 for the boot
loader, but doesn't give any way of installing a cluster chain onto
that inode without umounting the filesystem.)
