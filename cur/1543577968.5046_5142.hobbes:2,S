Sounds like the kernel is using ACPI reserved memory, so the first ACPI
event corrupts kernel memory and the kernel locks up.
I've seen similar problems with an IBM ThinkPad 600X, but it was fixed
somewhere in 2.4.0-pre12-test7. Try linux-2.4.0, if that doesn't work,
boot the kernel with "mem=1MB-less-than-the-machine-actually-has", so
for a 128MB machine, try "mem=127M".
