There is AFAIK no known exploit to BIND 8.2.3 and I don't see why
anyone should use a "novell Netcache backdoor". If I'd want to hack
your box, I would use this:
% telnet vger.timpanogas.com 22     
Trying 207.109.151.240...
Connected to vger.timpanogas.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
SSH-1.5-1.2.27
^]
telnet> quit
Well known exploits downloadable at any of the better hacking sites.

Come on, you can't be _that_ blind. Either you didn't install all your
vendor recommended updates or you installed self rolled programs and
got caught.
You even get connects on the telnet port (no daemon, though), so you
either have a hosts.allow (which _is_ spoofable) or a non-cleaned up
[x]inetd.conf which means you didn't harden your box for Internet
usage.
If you don't prepare your box for a hostile environment, you get
hit. First law of the Internet.
