that clears it up somewhat :)

Well, the thing I'm interested in is people overwriting parts of shared
libraries (at least those opened with dlopen). In my tests, I am using
mmap/msync to overwrite the library rodata section with
MS_SYNC|MS_INVALIDATE. When I do this the running copy (using
MAP_PRIVATE) appears unmodified, but no ETXTBSY error is given. What you
are saying would seem to indicate that the running program *should* be
modified.
Perhaps MS_INVALIDATE doesn't bother invalidating MAP_PRIVATE mappings?
Or am I missing a trick here? :)
(this is on intel btw).
