I agree.
However, the thing I object to is to saving that special string away, when
the information exists there as-is. I really don't see the advantage of
	printk("%s", dev->name);
over the much clearer
	printk("%d:%d:%d", BUS(dev), SLOT(dev), FN(dev))
Sure, the latter is slightly longer, but at least it's obvious what it
will actually print out - it's clear that now we're printing out the
_position_ of the card rather than it's "name".

If you want to make life easier, just do a
	char * pci_slot_fmt(struct pci_dev *dev)
	{
		static char fmt[10];
		sprintf(fmt, "%d:%d:%d", BUS(dev), SLOT(dev), FN(dev));
		return fmt;
	}
if it's the re-typing of the stuff you object to, and you just want to
have one place to change when you want to change the way you print out
devices. I'd certainly agree with that kind of thing. 
And I'd even agree to caching the string if I thought it had some reason
for it (performance, clarity, whatever), but as it stands I feel that
calling it "name" just confuses the issue completely and brings no real
advantage.
