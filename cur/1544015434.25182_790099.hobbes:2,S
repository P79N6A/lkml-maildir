I already have a fix for this pending in my tree:
net: fix section mismatch warnings in dccp/ccids/lib/tfrc.c
Removed the __exit annotation of tfrc_lib_exit(), in order to suppress the following section mismatch messages:
WARNING: net/dccp/dccp.o(.text+0xd9): Section mismatch in reference from the function ccid_cleanup_builtins() to the function .exit.text:tfrc_lib_exit()
The function ccid_cleanup_builtins() references a function in an exit section.
Often the function tfrc_lib_exit() has valid usage outside the exit section
and the fix is to remove the __exit annotation of tfrc_lib_exit.
WARNING: net/dccp/dccp.o(.init.text+0x48): Section mismatch in reference from the function ccid_initialize_builtins() to the function .exit.text:tfrc_lib_exit()
The function __init ccid_initialize_builtins() references
a function __exit tfrc_lib_exit().
This is often seen when error handling in the init function
uses functionality in the exit path.
The fix is often to remove the __exit annotation of
tfrc_lib_exit() so it may be used outside an exit section.
