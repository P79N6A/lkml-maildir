I have a worse problem.  :-)   I often run several instances of the
identically version-numbered kernel, all available from the LILO boot
menu, each instance having a different .config or perhaps compiled with
a different gcc.  If each instance wants to share
/lib/modules/[sameversion]/... then I've got a problem.  Ditto for
userspace programs compiled against /usr/include/linux and
/usr/include/asm, where I want the compiled program to correspond very
closely with the currently running kernel.  So...
I "fixed" this problem by creating /lib/modules/BootsAs/,
/usr/include/BootsAs/, etc.  Then, rc.sysinit looks in /proc/cmdline to
figure out what I typed at LILO, greps through /etc/lilo.conf to find
the physical /boot/[xyzzy].vmlinux that was booted, and it creates
symlinks so /lib/modules/[sameversion] -> /lib/modules/BootsAs/[xyzzy]
and so on.  This is also a win when you have several LILO targets that
point to the same kernel.
