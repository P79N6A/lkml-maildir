Thanks!
patch applies ok
compiles ok
boots ok
patch -R succeeds with lot's of hunks
Tried it anyway, and found an improvement only in cfq, where :
echo 512 > /sys/block/hda/queue/max_sectors_kb
gives full speed for 5-10 sec then drops to half speed
other scheds lock into half speed
echo 192 > /sys/block/hda/queue/max_sectors_kb
gives full speed for all scheds
Thanks!
