Same behavior here with a Pentium III 600, 128 MB RAM and 128 MB of swap.
Filled mem and swap with the infamous glob() "bug" (ls ../*/.. etc.), made
swapoff, and the machine kept very responsive except for the last 10-15
seconds before swapoff ends.
Even scrolling complex pages with Mozilla 0.9 worked smoothly :).
