   So if you would prefer to not do this in the kernel you can ignore
   the patch, but then the setkey application needs to be fixed.
In one sense yes, but in another no.
setkey is for manual keying and debugging.  Therefore, disallowing
experimenting with non-rfc-compliant orderings seems to lack purpose
to me.
