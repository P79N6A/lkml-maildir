VESA does not require VM86 so this change is completely wrong. Worse
still the x86-64 does not support VM86 so you have just crippled the
x86-64 port unneccessarily.
Please sort out your personal X server problem instead. To start with X
doesn't require VM86 to be present at all and can do software 8086 int
10 emulation for BIOS code.
