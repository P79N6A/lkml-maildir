Actually thats not the case in my experience, very often thing like that
go to the driver specific mailing lists or the driver maintainer in
private email. In fact this more common than a report going
linux-kernel.

I never claimed you don't, but some reports you never receive.
All I am suggesting is a CC, no fairytales or other stories to go with
it that actually takes time to write.
