No, that's not how that works in reality.  In practice, the boot loader 
picks the lowest address it can practically use, in order to minimize 
the conventional memory ceiling.  For example, PXELINUX always loads at 
0x50000, simply because odds that you have a PXE stack and can use 
0x90000 is about zero to none.  In fact, these days there are enough 
BIOSes that load stuff in the high part of memory that using 0x90000 is 
actively dangerous and **needs to be avoided**.  Theoretically, you're 
right; it adds a  very small amount of memory to the decompression.  If 
that matters, there is actually a very easy way to deal with it: for any 
boot loader there is a Lowest Usable Address (conventional memory 
ceiling).  You can use INT 12h and adjust the load address all the way 
up to 0x90000 if the conventional memory ceiling permits; this usually 
is something like five lines of assembly.

There can't be a "default load address".  0x90000 is actively dangerous 
and trying to encourage it for anything than legacy kernels is WRONG. 
If you can't handle this, then you need to go back to the drawing board.
