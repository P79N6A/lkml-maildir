Even for the same block dirty twice? I am not sure about that case
so I put it there. I got a lots of thing to do tonight.

I think we have the lock on ext3_rename. I might be wrong.
If other process can change the dir between the add new entry
and delete old entry. We should also need to check the entry have
been delete from other process in case fall into dead loop? 
Too bad I don't have time to look at those until tonight.

Do you have time to look at the missing "." and ".." entry patch?
Can you please change my email address in source file to vmware
if you submit it?
