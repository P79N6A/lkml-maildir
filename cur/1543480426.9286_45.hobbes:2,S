I disagree here.  For something as simple as ISA PnP, doing the hardware
access is userspace is not good.
I particularly like the isapnp modules which the ALSA people have.  I
don't know the PnP "protocol" well, but it seems to be about as simple as
is reasonable, while still providing good user (/proc/isapnp) and kernel
(functions like PCI - find_device(), &c) interfaces.
In short, I think it fits the "hardware detection framework" which Linus
said was the only PnP which we would be seeing on kernel.org...
