I recently upgraded from 2.2.12 to 2.3.19. Now my serial port doesn't work
properly, unless I do an explicit
setserial /dev/ttyS0 spd_vhi
When I turn my modem on, or when the computer boots, whichever is last,
the TR, HS, SD, and RD lights come on. Using minicom just has a line of
garbage rather than the usual line of AT commands under 2.2.
Letting minicom reset the modem clears the SD and RD lights, but the modem
still doesn't work. Its detected the IO and IRQ stuff correctly, but I
still need the setserial command to get the modem working.
After that, minicom/ppp works fine. The TR and HS lights stay on.
I haven't tested the other serial port yet, and I can check if a serial
mouse works (I have a PS2 one in this machine), if this would help.
Thanks,
Bradley
