i've attached mlock-test2.cc that should test this theory. The code
breaks up the mlock-ed region into 8 equal pieces and does mlock() on
them separately. It's basically a lock-break done in user-space. Does
this change the nature of xruns?
if it doesnt change the xruns then it shows that it's not the locking of
make_pages_present() that interacts with jackd, but it's what it does
that interacts with it (or with the audio driver).
assuming the DMA-starvation theory isnt excluded via mlock-test2.c:
prefaulting is quite memory-bandwidth-intense. It might even be that the
CPU, internally, deals with pagetable related memory fetches (and
writebacks) differently - e.g. gives it a higher priority on the bus. 
Does your audio card have a maximum PCI latency setting already?
