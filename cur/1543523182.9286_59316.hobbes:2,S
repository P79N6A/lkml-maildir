Hi again,
I have been trying to compile the latest kernel with FB support, but the
option doesn't appear (it's greyed out) within the xconfig option.  Is there
something missing?  or do I need to use the text config program to set this
up?
BTW:  I have noticed some of the post concerning complining kernel with the
Althlon -- I have ran into the same problems and have had to compile the
kermel using optimizations for the AMD K6 to get things to work.
