Why does overcommit in mode 2 (OVERCOMMIT_NEVER) explicitly force
MAP_NORESERVE mappings to reserve memory?
My understanding is that MAP_NORESERVE is a way for apps to state that
they are aware that the memory allocated may not exist and that they
might get a SIGSEGV and that's OK with them.
Failing to do this makes certain well-know apps (*cough* Sun Java
*cough*) fail to run, which seems to be rather unhelpful.
