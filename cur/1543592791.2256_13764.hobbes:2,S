Is this reproducible?
A patch went into ac3 which attempts to address qlogicisp problems on
Alpha.  It originated from the nether regions deep inside Compaq,
original source unknown.  There is a -extraordinarily slight-
possibility this patch (which simply adds "mb()") causes problems. 
However, it is more likely that the patch is harmless but also useless,
not fixing the real problem.
Other questions - is your machine SMP?  How much RAM?
