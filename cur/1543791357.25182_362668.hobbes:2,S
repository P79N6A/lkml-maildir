I cant speak for anything else than CONFIG_PPC_MULTIPLATFORM, but I bet
almost noone really uses the boot wrapper from the kernel. An external
mkzimage for the rest of the supported boards sounds like a good plan.
Cant be that hard to maintain as the kernel interface is stable.
We have such thing in opensuse, it needs an update for PReP and iSeries
to provide the flat device tree.
