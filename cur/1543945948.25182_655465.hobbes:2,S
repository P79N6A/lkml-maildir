Before the patchset, msgctl08 used to be run with the old msgmni value: 
16. Now it is run with a much higher msgmni value (1746 in my case), 
since it scales to the memory size.
When I call "msgctl08 100000 16" it completes fast.
Doing the follwing on the ref kernel:
echo 1746 > /proc/sys/kernel/msgmni
msgctl08 100000 1746
makes th test block too :-(
Will check to see where the problem comes from.
Rgards,
