I recently (very recently yes) i purchsed my self a Pentium III processor, 500
mhz .. nice toy for sure, but it seems the combination kernel 2.2.2 + pIII is
lethal ..
Whist running 2.2.1 there are no errors, but when i upgraded to 2.2.2, i got a
bug notice while booting up
bug: timer interupt set twice at (some number here)
this happend after scsi detection, before ppp/etc code in the kernel init.
The compiler i use is egcs 1.1.1, with a further clean redhat 5.2 setup.
The egcs compiler cant be the sole factor to blame for the bug, since
2.2.1 doesnt seem to mind pIII's at all.
If there's anything i can do to help solve this problem let me know, i know
im prolly one of the few people with a pIII  ATM.
