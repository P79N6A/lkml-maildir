I have to correct me: the code does not disable all interrupts from the
card, only the last one processed. But these may be send interrupts, too.

I now implemented that and do a short test (if it runs under normal

I now had this situation again and my patch really worked fine: the interface
continued to work fine after 55 packets got dropped.
