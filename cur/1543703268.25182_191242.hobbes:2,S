Ok - here is a patch that should fix lib/mask.c displaying and parsing
cpumasks for 64 bit big endian architectures.  It has only been tested
on 64 bit little endian architectures ;).  Technically, it is against
2.6.1-mm3, though it should work against any kernel with a lib/mask.c
file, since this is the first change to that file.
The comments in the patch explain the details.
Thanks to Paul Mackerras for the "eor-1" coding suggestion, and to Joe
Korty for keeping me honest.
Tomorrow I will attempt a patch to change the ascii format for masks to
zero-fill each word (8 ascii hex chars, representing 32 bits).
