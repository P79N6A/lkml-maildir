I propose the following as a global yacc rule; already used in usr/dash 
in the klibc tree, and which seems to work for both bison and BSD yacc:
quiet_cmd_yacc = YACC    $@
       cmd_yacc = $(YACC) -d -o $@ $<
$(obj)/%.c %(obj)/%.h: $(src)/%.y
         $(call cmd,yacc)
Note that bison seems to make smaller code than yacc, so I definiteily 
think we should default to bison over yacc.
