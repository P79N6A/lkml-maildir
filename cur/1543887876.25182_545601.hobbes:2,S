That should not be a big problem. Create like 4x950G virtual sparse
drives (takes roughly or so 4x100 MB on the host after mkfs), then
set up a raid inside the vm, with which you can play - even write
to it. Not sure how RAID5 will affect the host size of the virtual
drives, since during first resync when all disks are blank, it will
XOR it (0^0=1), and hence fills up the host disk.
