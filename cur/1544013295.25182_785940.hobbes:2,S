We _could_ make a "CONFIG_COMPILE_ONLY" check, but wouldn't it be even 
nicer to make sure the cross-compiles are something that might actually be 
expected to work?
I realize that cross-tools tend to lag a bit - the pressure to maintain 
them tends to be much lower - but I was sure we had somebody who did a 
reasonable cross-compiler toolchain. Is gcc-4.1 really the most modern 
thing that is easily available?
