Hi Matt,

Ok, I compared your patches againts mine and they were almost identical. :-)
After some more coding I have now a first set of patches to get everything
moved and to add the missing watchdog drivers. Next patches will contain
updates on the documentation and on each driver seperatly. 
The first patches are:
Patch 1 : move of existing watchdog drivers in drivers/char/watchdog/
Patch 2 : remove of 'old' watchdog drivers in drivers/char/
Patch 3 : cleanup additional spaces in headers + addition of MODULE-info
Patch 4 : C99 designated initializers for watchdog drivers
Patch 5 : add extra watchdog drivers
If you want to test them you can get them at the following URL:

 .
Greetings,
Wim.
