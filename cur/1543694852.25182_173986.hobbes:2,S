Thanks.  You're now the third person (schlicht@uni-mannheim.de,
jeremy@goop.org) who reports that the weird oopses (usually in
invalidate_list()) go away when the fbdev code is disabled.
You're using vesafb on nvidia, Jeremy is using vesafb on either radeon or

Has anyone tried CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB and CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, see if that
turns anything up?
