I am sure the maintainer would appreciate if you wrote down what you found
difficult/missing from the docs (in the form of a patch to the existing
docs perhaps).

#include <linux/limits.h> gives:
#define OPEN_MAX         256    /* # open files a process may have */
But autofs is well behaved and doesn't use kernel headers but that makes
it fails on newer glibcs (at least I think that was it).
Just define it. If autofs4 is doing the same as autofs3 then it is only
used for program lookups (where a program generates the map to use) and
unless you are going to use those it won't matter at all.
There is also some info here, including how to find the autofs
mailinglist.

Or google for "autofs OPEN_MAX", "autofs mailinglist archive", ...
There appears to be a autofs-open_max.patch somewhere.
