The calling from fork code only occurs if there is one millisecond of 
time_slice left so it will only very rarely be hit. I dont think this 
accounting problem is worth worrying about.

Ah yes. Good point. Will add that to the equation.

Right you are. The cpu accounting uses primitive on-interrupt run time 
which as we know is not infallible. To extend this I'll have to keep a 
timer based on the sched_clock which is already implemented. That's 
something for me to work on.

And that will need looking into.
Thanks very much for your comments!
