O.k.  I was simply thinking that if we weren't reprogramming the mtrrs, it
would be a good idea to make certain we didn't map any PCI drivers
into a write back area.

O.k.  If it easy.  
Currently I can find information for some via chipsets.  One
serverworks chipset, practically every intel chipset, the AMD 750
& 760 chipsets, current SIS chipsets, and the alpha tsunami chipset.
There is probably more that is just what I have actually seen.
There are complications of memory reserved for AGP, and memory
holes.  But they shouldn't be too bad.
My only problem is I don't have the bandwidth to code it up at the
moment, but if it's the kind of patch that if done well you are
likely to accept I'll look at it.  
Since it is only likely to be 30-40 lines per chipset it should
only take an hour or two per chipset.  And after the first couple are
in the kernel others can clone the work. 
This has the nice side effect that once we know where the ram is on a
chipset we can reprogram the MTRRs correctly ourselves, correcting bad
BIOS's.

That sounds reasonable.  Since we don't always have all the
documentation we need heuristics so we can run on boards where we are
just guessing.
On the not trusting the BIOS, would you accept patches to do more
of the lowlevel setup?  
There is a pnp-os spec that basically says you should only need to
initialize devices necessary for booting.  With linuxBIOS we are
working to take this to the extreme, and define devices necessary for
booting as:  RAM, the bootstrap CPU, the Flash ROM chip, and possibly
a serial port for debugging.  Currently I need to a little more setup
than this because of limitations in linux. 
The more of the lowlevel set we can get into linux, the less you need
to trust the BIOS and the less I need to code to get linuxBIOS up on
an individual motherboard.
