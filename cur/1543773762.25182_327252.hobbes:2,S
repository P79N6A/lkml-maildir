This is a good idea and I wanted to do it for a while, only I was unable
to figure how to write the "depends on USB!=n" part. I'm all for it.
Let me give it a test here just to be sure, but I think we're good.
One question though, do we want this:

Seems superfluous to me, because we kept CONFIG_USB_MON. This place should
probably be left alone.
