The most upsetting thing is the followings:

 Note some pages coming up from swap.
 This is vmstat exactly corresponding to doing read via mmap. So it
 looks like current VM  preforms in come cases to swap out pages from
 mapped files rather then discarding them :(
 This of course reduces performance on sequential IO :(
