Not as the only indication I agree. But for machines running X that
are actually used by people I think it's important to always give some kind 
of visual feedback when the X server freezes. And kgdb will make the X server
freeze. You could actually make it a notifier list to register severals
ways to do this, e.g. the cluster people could add something that makes
it flash a warning light. For a standard box I think flashing the keyboard
is a good default for now
(ok there are USB keyboards too, for those there will need to be a different
solution)

That doesn't tell the user at all why his X server just froze.
But it may be a good addition.
