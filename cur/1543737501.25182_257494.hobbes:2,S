I have used Maxtor "SATA" drives that require
the O/S to do a "SET FEATURES :: UDMA_MODE" command
on them before they will operate reliably.
This despite the SATA spec stating clearly that
such a command should/will have no effect.
I suppose libata does this already, but just in case not..
Something simple to check up on.
