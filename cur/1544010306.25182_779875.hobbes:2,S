I spoke too soon: no, it didn't help as it happened again last night. I
don't see how CIFS oculd have helped, as userlevel smbd has AFAIK nothing
to do with the CIFS kernel module?
Apparently only pulling the client cable does NOT provoke the bug (tried
several times), whereas putting the client box into sleep mode does
(though that worked at least once as well). This time it also didn't
reboot properly without hard power-off. :/
Now running with Manfred's patch to idr.c; will report back if it happens
again.
