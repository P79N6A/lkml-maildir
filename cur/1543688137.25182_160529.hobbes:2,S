That was because they wanted the non-streaming files to be left in the cache.

I'm sorry to say, but you *will* get lower performance if you lower the mem=
value below your working set.  This will also lower the total amount of
memory available for your applications, and force your apps, to swap and
balance cache, and app memory.
That's not what you are looking to benchmark.
