Approving messages with Majordomo requires piping them through an approval
script or forwarding them back to the list with an Approved: header (very*
error prone).
Multiple moderators requires having a means of filtering duplicates
(painful, but I've built one) or having round-robin delivery to moderators
(the Majordomo 2.0 approach).
