My clients are all RHEL3.  I'll give the nfs_fsstress scripts a shot.

The server I'll be testing is dual Xeon, 2GB RAM, 2 x 3ware 9500-12 
controllers running the 9.1.5.2 firmware and using the stock centos-4 
drivers.  (I see a huge performance hit using the latest 3ware driver set, 
9.2.)  The 3wares are doing hardware RAID5, and I do software RAID0 across 
'em.  Networking is the same -- 2 e1000s, not bonded.  I'm running 256 NFS 
daemons, well, just because.
