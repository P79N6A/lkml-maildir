They are common to folks wanting to playing back any kind of video image
with reasonable quality. What's happened is that sloppy apps are using
slopping OSes to create one big glitchfest that consumers are use to.
Coming from an old SGI background I know how idiotic this is. Yes,
RTOSes aren't used for media applications, not because its exotic, but
because most folks that are Microsoft influence, includes Linux, can't
write decent media apps even if IRIX and the sources for the apps are
handle to them.

This would changes it. RTOS companies are typically are driven by
defense contracts and the like which is a culture that encourages
consumer technologies like this to be developed. If you give apps folks
the necessary tools, combine that with the knowledge, then this would
be much more prevalent as a base level of performance for these apps.
If anything media apps have been sucky for the very reason Valdis
previously described.
