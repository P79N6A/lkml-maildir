Bad bad bad!
You shouldn't be using floating point in the kernel at all! Most
architectures do not save the full floating point register set on
entry so if you start messing with the fp registers you may corrupt
user space applications.
You need to either write a customer user space app or use a table as
Arjan suggested.
