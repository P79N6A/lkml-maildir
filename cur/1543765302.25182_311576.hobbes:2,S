Subject: [PATCH] Possible fix for git
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I noticed earlier today that I ran out of file descriptors when doing a
'git commit'. As far as I can see the following patch ought to take
care of the problem.
