hm, there is a cond_resched_softirq() for every line output so the 
actual latency from this alone shouldnt be that bad. While /proc/net/tcp 
has a quadratic algorithm, the per-line latency is O(N), which shouldnt 
show up on the radar.
but note that Ananitya is running a fast system as a stock desktop 
system browsing the web, so there shouldnt be tons of sockets. So the 
latency isnt caused by /proc/net/tcp itself, but there does seem to be 
some networking related anomaly.
we'll hopefully be able to tell this more specifically from the re-done 
trace.
