Actually, I don't think we really agree. My view is that using
DIPC/MOSIX encourages bad programming and will hardly ever lead to
efficient parallel applications. Now if someone wants to write a user
space layer that gives them such a programming model, that's fine by
me.
But I'd object to even one nanosecond of extra latency or one byte of
kernel bloat to (exclusively) support such schemes, because I think
they're flawed. It's the same reason we don't want STREAMS in the
kernel. It's a flawed concept and it shouldn't bloat the kernel or
kill performance for sensible networking.
Now, if DIPC/MOSIX requires a kernel module and perhaps some system
calls, I don't mind if they are allocated some slots in the syscall
table (just like we did for STREAMS). But anything else should stay
out of the kernel.
