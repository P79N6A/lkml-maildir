Hi out there!
I was asked a question lately that I was unable to answer: Assume you
want to make a (encrypted, but that's not the issue here) filesystem on
a loopback block device (/dev/loop*). Can this be a journalling one? In
other words, will
prompt$ mount -t {ext3|reiserfs} -oloop my_file my_mount_point
be stable to work with?
TIA,
Marc
