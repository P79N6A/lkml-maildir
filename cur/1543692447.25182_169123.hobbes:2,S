Hi,
I have trouble with linux-2.6.0-test6 and via82xx. With default
parameters I'm unable to play sound. I've tracked down the problem to
this change:
   - use dxs_support=3 (48k fixed) as default, since there are so many
     problems with dxs_support=0.
Loading module I see this:
via82xx: Assuming DXS channels with 48k fixed sample rate.
         Please try dxs_support=1 option and report if it works on your machine.
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:11.5 to 64
         
and when I try to play anything the player locks and I see the
following messages:
ALSA sound/core/pcm_lib.c:2156: playback write error (DMA or IRQ trouble?)
ALSA sound/core/pcm_lib.c:2156: playback write error (DMA or IRQ trouble?)
ALSA sound/core/pcm_lib.c:2156: playback write error (DMA or IRQ trouble?)
dxs_support=1 doesn't help since I  have a VT8233A. dxs_support=2 is ok.
Looking at  the code I see  that VT8233A (without dsx)  and VT8233 (with
dsx) are selected  using dxs_support parameter. Is this the  only way to
do it? 2.6.0-t5 worked for me, not sure  that this is a bug but at least
it's a regression.
This is my audio device:
00:11.5 Class 0401: 1106:3059 (rev 40)
        Subsystem: 1695:3004
        Flags: medium devsel, IRQ 5
        I/O ports at e000 [size=256]
        Capabilities: [c0] Power Management version 2
                                
Luca
