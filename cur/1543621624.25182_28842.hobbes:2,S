After about 50 days of uptime on 2.4.17 on an Alpha, I started getting
this message from ps, et al.  The adjtimex program says:
         mode: 0
       offset: -2942
    frequency: -11020216
etc. (I'm running ntpd).
50 days is about 4320000000 clock ticks (normally 1024 Hz) which is
suspiciously close to 2^32.  Perhaps something is rolling over?
