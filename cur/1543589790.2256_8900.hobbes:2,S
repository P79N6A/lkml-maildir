Hello all,
           I am just a beginner in linux programming and I want to write a
script for disconnecting users in cisco router.Could anybody help me out.
           The scenario is like this. I have been using Cisco router2500
and in that we have users connected to it in async port.
when I execute the command.
Router#sh users
I will get something like this
Line          User             Host(s)            Idle location
1 tty 1        user             async interface    dial-up for ISP
now if i execute the command
Router#clear line 1
the "user" will be disconnected from the router.
           Now what I want is to write a script that will disconnect the
user from the router.
           When you telnet to the router the process goes like this
telnet ip address
then it will ask for 
password:
then you get something like this
router>en         (you have to type en to enable it)
then again it asks for password
password:  
once you give the password
Router#show users         (you have to execute the following command)
then if you want to disconnect particular user then you give command
Router#clear line 1 
how do i put the whole thing in a script and achieve the above .Could anybody 
help me out.
Thanking you,
Ajay Dangol.
