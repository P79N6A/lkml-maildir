The profile looks bogus. The NIC driver is nowhere in sight. Normally
its mmap IO for interrupts and device registers should show. I would
double check it (e.g. with normal profile) 
In case it is no bogus: 
Most of these are either atomic_inc/dec of reference counters or some
form of lock. The system_call could be the int 0x80 (using the SYSENTER
patches would help), which also does atomic operations implicitely.
restore_all is IRET, could also likely be speed up by using SYSEXIT.
If NAPI hurts here then it surely not because of eating CPU time.
