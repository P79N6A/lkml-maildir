Subject: [PATCH] Allow group ownership of TUN/TAP devices
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/18/228

I recieved from Guido Guenther the patch below to the TUN/TAP driver
which allows group ownerships to be effective.
It seems reasonable to me.
> the attached patches allow tun ownership by group. We found this useful
> since we can then spawn tapX devices on system boot (via
> /etc/network/interfaces) which logged on users can then use for their
> virtual machines.
> 
> The first patch is for the kernel, the second one for the tunctl. They
> shouldn't change existing behaviour and we introduced a new syscall for
> the group setting. The user now is allowed to send packages if either
> his euid or his egid matches the one specified via tunctl (via -u or -g
> respecitvely). If both gid and uid are set via tunctl, both have to
> match. In case you find these useful, please apply.
