they are 100% identical. except for the fact that one is 
master and the other slave on the same cable.
I did not include the results for both in order to shorten the message.
here we go, just in case:

Mr Davidovac Zoran mentioned normal transfer speeds with kernel 2.4.17.  
Should I try ? Are there significant differences between 2.4.9-21 (or -31)
and 2.4.17 in the IDE drivers ?
This is Linux Country. On a quiet night, you can hear
Windows NT reboot!
