This gets interesting. We probably need revokefs (which we use
internally as a substitute for revoke inodes) to be stacked on top of
the actual fs so that you can still read from the fd. But most of the
revocation is still the same, we need to watch out for fork(2) and
dup(2) and take down shared mappings.
