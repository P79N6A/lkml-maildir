   Seems to be my day for this happening.  A bit more data:
   There's next to no collisions going on, from ifconfig eth0 on the
SERVER:
          RX packets:31331103 errors:0 dropped:1 overruns:0 frame:151
          TX packets:42576602 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:33733 txqueuelen:100 
and the WORKSTATION:
          RX packets:301884 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:238086 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:397 txqueuelen:100 
Also the numbers on the SERVER at least for collisions didn't increase
the last time NFS cut out on me.
   I'm not seeing ANY other logging in kern.log on either machine above
the NFS timeout reports, nothing about NICs having trouble or the like.
