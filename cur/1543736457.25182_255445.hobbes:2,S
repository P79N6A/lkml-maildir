Is Amanda set up incorrectly if SuSE's default 2.6.5 kernel and a
vanilla 2.6.7 work well even with clients, but 2.6.9-rc2-mm1 to -mm3
versions fail at the same task, with the same Amanda installation and
software?
I only exchanged the kernel, nothing else. Same hardware, same
user-space software.
I doubt that it's Amanda's configuration. I'd expect a "stable"
2.6.9-whatever kernel to be backwards compatible with its 2.6.X
predecessors.
