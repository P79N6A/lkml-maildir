The individual MAINTAINERS files eliminates what Linus
described as their "hotness".
No shared updates by multiple parties.

I believe that wrong.
Maintainer patterns frequently look like:
F:	arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/
F:	drivers/cpufreq/
F:	include/linux/cpufreq.h
If in source, this would currently require 21 + 12 + 1 
modifications instead of 1.

I think the insertion of maintainers into source
itself is wrong.  It's freeform, error prone and
requires significant modifications to source files
as maintainers come and go.

Which is the help I'm looking for.
Can someone please help here on ideas or implementation
adding a makefile target for MAINTAINERS from files
in a specific subdirectory?

In the distributed form, you'll still end up with
~400 new files spread all over the tree.
Either way, you'll have hundreds of files.
$ grep "^F:" MAINTAINERS |  sed -e "s/[A-Za-z0-9\_\*\.\-]*$//" | sort |
uniq | wc -l
415
Centralized as maintainers/* or distributed as ../../../Maintainers
Pick one, I don't much care, but I'm still looking for
Makefile/KConfig help reassembling it into a single
MAINTAINERS block similar to the current form.
Help?
cheers, Joe
