Eric, this looks very good. The pspace internal implementation
is very similar to what I was working on objectifying the pidmap
etc. I was pursuing the same route in using find_pid()
functions as the means to distinguish pspaces rather then
actually virtualizing them.
But this code already goes so much further in many many aspects.
Kudos to you.
I am still going through some of the details, but this is an
excellent starting position.

Yes, but I have one question for you...
Large parts of the patch are adding the pspace argument
to find_task_by_pid() and in many cases that argument is
current->pspace.
It might bring down the size of the patch if you
have
find_task_by_pid( pid )  {  return find_task_pidspace_by_pid ( current->pspace, pid ); }
and then only deal with the exceptional cases using find_task_pidspace_by_pid
when the pidspace is different..

At he surface it looks OK .. how does this work in a multi-threaded
process which does cloen ( CLONE_NPSPACE ) ?
We discussed at some point that exec is the right place to do it,
but what I get is that because this is the container_init task
we are OK !
A bit clarification would help here ...
