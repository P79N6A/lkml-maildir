The security check is comparing key label to task label.  If it's not
done 100% in current context, then task must be passed to get access
to proper label.  So, for example, request-key is done by the special
privileged /sbin/request-key via usermodehelper on behalf of someone else.

Just remove the comment, and we'll all agree ;-)

Hmm, suppose, but auditing is not the charter of LSM.  So in this case,
the previous hook can audit key creation if needed.  Just looking to
avoid hook proliferation if possible.

I see, what would they used for?
