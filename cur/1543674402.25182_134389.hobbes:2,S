I've applied all of these to my tree, but I didn't apply the following
to Linus's tree because they just didn't apply.  I tried to fix up a few
by hand, and got some of them to work, but eventually gave up on the
rest.  So here's a list of the ones that didn't go into Linus's tree:
	USB speedtouch: use optimally sized reconstruction buffers
	USB speedtouch: send path micro optimizations
	USB speedtouch: kfree_skb -> dev_kfree_skb
	USB speedtouch: receive code rewrite
Also this one didn't go into Linus's tree, as it's already there:
	USB speedtouch: remove MOD_XXX_USE_COUNT
So, any patches against Linus's latest bk tree to bring the above into
sync would be appreciated.
thanks,
