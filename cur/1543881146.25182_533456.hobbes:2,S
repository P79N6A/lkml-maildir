well, i just simulated a runaway X at nice -19 on CFS (on a UP box), and 
while the box was a tad laggy, i was able to killall it without 
problems, within 2 seconds that also included a 'su'. So it's not an 
issue in CFS, it can be turned off, and because every distro has another 
way to renice Xorg, this is a convenience hack until Xorg standardizes 
it into some xorg.conf field. (It also makes sure that X isnt preempted 
by other userspace stuff while it does timing-sensitive operations like 
setting the video modes up or switching video modes, etc.)
