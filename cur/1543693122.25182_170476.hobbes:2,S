Well, then, you're going to have to study and learn the entire
TCP stack in order to learn how to do this and furthermore to be
able to do this safely.
I'm a bit skeptical of what you actually want to use this for,
so I'm going to choose not to help you with this until you give
some more details of what you're exactly up to.
