I added git@vger.kernel.org and Junio Hamano
Another possibility is improving git to allow
some sort of "declaration of interest" in bits
of projects.
That would allow options like:
o  git-format-patch to include CCs
o  git-commit and git-branch to notify or
     take some other action
etc...
It's generic, applies to multiple projects, etc.
I don't care which mechanism is used, I just want
to be able to CC appropriate people and lists on
changes to their areas of interest without wasting
time searching all over the place per file changed.
The LK MAINTAINERS file is weakly specified, but
I'm not a git-geek, nor do I want to be one, so
MAINTAINERS was the file I could easiest change
with minimal impact to LK sources.
The get_maintainer script is trivial,
I'm not wedded to it at all.
