And the IRQ handler needs to do some extra job... Anyway, it looks -rt
breaks synchronize_sched() and needs to have it fixed:
"/**
 * synchronize_sched - block until all CPUs have exited any non-preemptive
 * kernel code sequences.
 *
 * This means that all preempt_disable code sequences, including NMI and
 * hardware-interrupt handlers, in progress on entry will have completed
 * before this primitive returns."

Please realize that evey microsecond wasted on a 'low performant'
driver is taken from high performers and if we can help it why
shouldn't we?
