I'm not overly hopeful. If they fix the problem, then it's likely
that the real bug is hidden.

Yes. And the failures you were seeing with my first patch were coming
from the mempool code anyway. We want those to fail early so they don't
eat into the min_free_kbytes memory.
You could try raising min_free_kbytes though. If that fixes it, then it
indicates there might be some problem in a memory allocation failure
path in software raid somewhere.
