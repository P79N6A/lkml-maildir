hello 
i think there is a bug in the 2.5.0 kernel, patched with patch-2.5.1-pre2
the bug seems to be related with the CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDESCSI option
this problem does not arise with the previous patch-2.5.1-pre1 patch
the problem is that with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDESCSI enabled, the kernel cannot
compile, while with this option not enabled, the kernel can compile
the compilation stops with the following messages:
---
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686 -malign-functions=4     -c -o ide-scsi.o ide-scsi.c
