It's up to you, IMHO you're doing a mistake, but I don't mind as long as our
customers aren't at risk of early oom kills (or worse kernel crashes)
with some db load (especially without swap the risk is huge for all
users, since all anonymous memory will be pinned like ptes, but with ~3G
of pagetables they're at risk even with swap).  At least you *must*
admit that without my patch applied as I posted, there's a >0 probabity
of running out of normal zone which will lead to an oom-kill or a
deadlock despite 10G of highmem might still be freeeable (like with
clean cache). And my patch obviously cannot make it impossible to run
out of normal zone, since there's only 800m of normal zone and one can
open more files than what fits in normal zone, but at least it gives the
user the security that a certain workload can run reliably. Without this
patch there's no guarantee at all that any workload will run when >1G of
ptes is allocated.
This below fix as well is needed and you won't find reports of people
reproducing this race condition. Please apply. CC'ed Hugh. Sorry Hugh, I
know you were working on it (you said not in the weekend IIRC), but I've
been upgraded to latest bk so I had to fixup quickly or I would have to
run the racy code on my smp systems to test new kernels.
