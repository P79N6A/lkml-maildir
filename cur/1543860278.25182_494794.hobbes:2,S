Then GCC is not a "reasonably good compiler". Considering
#define MAX 6400
struct foo {
    int line[MAX];
};
void bar(struct foo *a) {
    int i;
    for(i = 0; i < MAX; ++i)
        a->line[i] = -1;
}
void baz(struct foo *a) {
    __builtin_memset(a->line, -1, sizeof(a->line));
}
`gcc -O3 -c test.c` will generate a classic loop rather than a repz
movsd for bar(). baz() will get a call to an extern memset(),
probably because gcc could not figure out how to make a repz for it
and hence thought it was better to use an external hand-crafted
memset.
