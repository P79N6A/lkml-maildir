Subject: [patch 1/2] Avoid wasting IRQs patch update (i386)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The patch addresses a problem with ACPI SCI interrupt entry, which gets re-used, and the IRQ 
is assigned to another unrelated device. The patch corrects the code such that SCI IRQ is 
skipped and duplicate entry is avoided.
Second issue came up with VIA chipset, the problem was caused by original patch assigning IRQs 
starting 16 and up. The VIA chipset uses 4-bit IRQ register for internal interrupt routing, and 
therefore cannot handle IRQ numbers assigned to its devices. The patch corrects this problem 
by allowing PCI IRQs below 16.
