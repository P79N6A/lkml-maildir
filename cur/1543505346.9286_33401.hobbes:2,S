I think you screwed up your dependencies: sx_init would also get
-=called=- if this were the normal situation. Somehow, you first set
CONFIG_SX = y, then switched to config_SX=M, and one way or another
tty_io.c didn't get recompiled.
Near the end of tty_io.c we have:
#ifdef CONFIG_RISCOM8
        riscom8_init();
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_SPECIALIX
        specialix_init();
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_SX
        sx_init();
#endif
which is supposed to "evaporate" (i.e. evaluate to "nothing") if we
don't have the RISCOM8, specialix IO8+ or SX support compiled into the
kernel. If a driver is a module, as far as the rest of the kernel is
concerned, it isn't there....
Linus shall I make you a patch that moves all these to "__initcall"?
The problem is that it involves lots of drivers maintained by others.
