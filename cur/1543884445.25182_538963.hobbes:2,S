That's only addressing part of the issue.  What about automatic or static 
external variables that are declared but may go unreferenced depending on 
preprocessor macros?  You need to annotate them with __attribute__ 
((unused)) to suppress compiler warnings.  Globally disabling such 
warnings would eventually cause unused code to go unnoticed.
