OK, that's a fair cop.  I agree.  In fact, for readv/writev(), POSIX 
does specify:
"If the sum of the iov_len values is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the 
operation shall fail and no data shall be tranferred."
... which is good precedence for doing so for all values.
So, what system calls are affected?  sendfile, [p]read[v], [p]write[v], 
send*, recv*, any others?
