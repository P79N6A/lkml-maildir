I don't really understand the argument for why "it shouldn't"; but it
doesn't really matter because it already does - all possible root fs
devices (except loopback) are already hardcoded in the kernel so that it
knows what to make of 'root=/dev/hda3'.  I don't care if 'policy' on this
matter is dictated in the kernel - for me it's a welcome consistency! Look
at the crap with the 'sg' devices; sga vs sg1.  The policy argument
carries no weight at all for me, since I can always create symlinks
(debian does sg1 -> sga) and currently I only see benefits to a consistent
naming scheme.  Show me where this ties my hands or causes me problems and
I'll listen. 
Given all I've heard and all I've read (devfs FAQ) and the small size of
devfs, count me 'strongly in favor'.

devfsd?
