It would be great to see a patch that causes process accounting records to
be written out for all tasks when pacct is toggled off, logfiles switched,
etc.  I suppose a field to indicate if the task had actually exited or not
would be neccessary.
This would make life easier on those of us who track users' cpu usage from
day to day or whatnot.  Long-running processes can be accounted for in the
correct time frame.  Between the field denoting if a task had not exited
at the time the pacct record was written, the task's creation time, and
the process id it would be easy to subtract the relavent amounts from the
previous interval during analysis of the process accounting log to get
correct values for all intervals, even if a process runs for months on
end.
