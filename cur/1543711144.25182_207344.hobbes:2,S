Hi,
The patch below breaks my ppc64 box. None of the keys behave as expected :)
I also get a bunch of stuff in the dmesg:
atkbd.c: Use 'setkeycodes 66 <keycode>' to make it known.
atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0x66 on isa0060/serio0).
The boot messages show:
serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
input: PS/2 Logitech Mouse on isa0060/serio1
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
If I back the patch out, things work again and I get:
serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
input: PS/2 Logitech Mouse on isa0060/serio1
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
input: AT Raw Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
Sounds like assuming we are always in translate mode is bad for me.
