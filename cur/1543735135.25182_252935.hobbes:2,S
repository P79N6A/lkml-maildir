Current preempt is broken, sure.  But having robust preempt
would allow code simplification.  Long loops outside critical
sections would be ok - no time or code spent testing for a need for
rescheduling because you'll be preempted when necessary anyway.
Or am I missing something?  Other than that current preempt isn't up to
this and might be hard to get there?
