 These can be checked for explicitly as the list isn't likely to grow.  I
can dig a few Intel docs for IDs of 486-class PCI chipsets that have no
PCI-ISA bridge if they'd be useful.
 Also note that there are PCI-ISA bridges that are reported as "non-VGA
unclassified" devices as they predate PCI 2.0.  The SIO (82378IB/ZB) comes
to mind here.  The bridge is used in certain models of Alpha systems as
well.  The bridges would need to be listed by IDs, too.
