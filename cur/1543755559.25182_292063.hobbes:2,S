Additional information:
My swap-file is also on /dev/sdb2. It appears as though swap
is being written beyond the end of the SCSI device and the
device doesn't like it. Also on a subsequent re-boot the
signature in the swap file had been destroyed so that swapon
didn't like it. I needed to use `mkswap` again.
