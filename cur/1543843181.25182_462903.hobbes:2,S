I think that your SSDT is valid.  I can't point to a specific
reference in the spec, but I think the "try _HID first, then try
_CID" strategy is clearly the intent.  Otherwise, there would be
no reason to separate _HID from _CID.

I support this, although I do understand that it will make it more
difficult to integrate ACPI into the driver model because the driver
model currently only does one pass to check whether a driver can claim
a device.
