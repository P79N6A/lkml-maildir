I was actually out at something different...
        /* Make sure a caller can chown. */
        if ((ia_valid & ATTR_UID) &&
            (current->fsuid != inode->i_uid ||
             attr->ia_uid != inode->i_uid) && !capable(CAP_CHOWN))
                goto error;
for example. Using current->[e]uid would not make sense here.
