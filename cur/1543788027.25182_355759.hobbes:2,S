You are right, the patch is supposed to export that variable as well.
I must have forgot to add it to the file list using quilt before sending
it out, and I tested it as built-in so I didn't catch it.
I'll fix this.  Thank you.
We're only using send_group_sig_info because it does a check for signal
'zero' which means status check.  send_sig_info doesn't do that check any
more.  We could probably just handle this inside job some how and use
send_sig_info instead.
