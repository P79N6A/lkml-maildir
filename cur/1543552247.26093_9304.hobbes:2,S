I am using gcc 2.95.2 from its release, and i doesn't encounter any problems
on kernel compilation. Yes, i saw compiling problems on mailing lists, but i
think, that gcc 2.95.2 should be used widely as kernel compiler. It's better
than forcing users to have old 2.7.2.3 (even 2.95.2 is now year old), or to
have 2 compilers - one for 'normal' programs, second for compiling kernel.
It's more stable than gcc 2.95(.1), much more stable than pgcc,*cc, and its
millenia far from gcc 2.96 snapshot. It will be nice to point in Changes
*explicitly*, that gcc 2.96 will not work, that gcc 2.95.2 will work in most
cases, and if it will not (or if error in runtime), try to use egcs-whatever or
gcc 2.7.2.*. Gcc 2.95.2 (in fact anything > 2.7.2.3) is there compared as equal to
pgcc, which is unfair.
