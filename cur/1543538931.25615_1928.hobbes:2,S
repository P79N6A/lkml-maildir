The main problem is that it doesn't handle accessing data elements at
all. In other words, you need to call a DLL function _for_everything_.
That's a serious performance killer.
In other words, it trades off performance against pseudo-compatibility.
(How many old NT drivers actually _do_ work with the new NT interfaces?
They may load, but then the whole thing crashes...)
