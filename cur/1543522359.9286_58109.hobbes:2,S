	a complete breakdown - while I tried to create a countermeasure
	for one particularly badly broken WinNT MTA software so that
	we could kick away 2/3rds of VGER's input queue log, I broke
	more than my intention was..
	When I then did put it into use, I realized in about 15 minutes
	what I had done, and reworked it properly.
