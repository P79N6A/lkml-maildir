Then you are running loop that fails in few seconds using my tests.

Writable file backed loops received death sentence when GFP_NOFS was
introduced to kernel, and they have been on death row since then. The best
way is to set up partition backed loop using loop-AES. Mainline loop is
still prone to deadlock, both file backed and device backed.
