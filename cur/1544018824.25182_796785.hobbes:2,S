Thank you very much, James.
Thanks to you, I found the root cause of the
problem. The acpi_pci_get_bridge_handle() function assumes
pci_bus->self is NULL on the root bus. But it is not true
and pci_bus->self can have a non-NULL value on some
platfroms (like yours). So it must check pci_bus->parent
instead.
I found some other code that has the same wrong assumption.
I'll make a fix for them and send it soon.
Thanks,
