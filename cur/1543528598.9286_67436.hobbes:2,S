I'm seeing transmit timeouts _again_ in 2.3.49 with my eepro100, vanilla
2.3.49 driver.  This driver was fixed in 2.3.48 and worked perfectly. 
There are now timeouts occurring in 2.3.49, even though the driver was
not changed.  What gives?
Dual-processor SMP box.  "ping -s 3000 -f foo" reproduces it in a second
or two, just like in 2.3.47 before the eepro100 patch that moved
netif_stop_queue/netif_start_queue into the spin_lock()ed code.
