You're right, the original problem still remains. The tracking is still
2x compared to Linux 2.4.
Here's how I did the measurement.
Get a foot-scale and start xev. Ajust xev so that the coordiates of the
window are 0,y (y is y-axis - don't care) in the X root window (my res is 1024x768).
Now align the mouse so that it shows 0,0 on the top left corner in the xev window
and move the mouse exactly one 1 inch and you'll see that under Linux 2.6.0-test7
the x axis position is at something like 325. However repeating the same test under
Linux 2.4.22 puts the mouse at x axis position 170 (gives me a accelearation factor
of about 2x).
This is a horribly crude test but it explains my problem that the mouse driver isn't
tracking correctly.
Hope this helps figuring out the problem.
