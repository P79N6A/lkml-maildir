Yes.  I have improved the comment over page_file_cache() a bit:
/**
 * page_file_cache(@page)
 * Returns !0 if @page is page cache page backed by a regular filesystem,
 * or 0 if @page is anonymous, tmpfs or otherwise ram or swap backed.
 *
 * We would like to get this info without a page flag, but the state
 * needs to survive until the page is last deleted from the LRU, which
 * could be as far down as __page_cache_release.

The bdi will no longer be accessible by the time a page
makes it to free_hot_cold_page, which is one place in the
kernel where this information is needed.
