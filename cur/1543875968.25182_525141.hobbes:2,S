Okay, the attached patch applies. Can someone comment on whether
it makes sense? (pasted inline for comments)
From: Brian Braunstein <linuxkernel@bristyle.com>
Fixed tun/tap driver's handling of hw addresses. The hw address is stored in
both the net_device.dev_addr and tun.dev_addr fields.  These fields were not
kept synchronized, and in fact weren't even initialized to the same value.
Now during both init and when performing SIOCSIFHWADDR on the tun device
these values are both updated.  However, if SIOCSIFHWADDR is performed on the
net device directly (for instance, setting the hw address using ifconfig),
the tun device does not get updated.  Perhaps the tun.dev_addr field should
be removed completely at some point, as it is redundant and
net_device.dev_addr can be used anywhere it is used.
