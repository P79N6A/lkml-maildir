One way to tell if this is true, is simply to time how long
the failed operation takes.  If the drive truly does not do retries,
then the media error should be reported more or less instantly
(assuming drive was already spun up).
If the failure takes more than a few hundred milliseconds to be reported,
or in this case 4-7 seconds typically, then we know the drive was doing
retries before it reported back.
I haven't seen any drive fail instantly yet.
Can anyone with those newfangled "RAID edition" drives try it
and report back?  Oh.. you'll need a way to create a bad sector.
I've got patches and a command-line utility for the job.
If your drive supports "WRITE UNCORRECTABLE" ("hdparm -I", w/latest hdparm),
then the patches aren't needed.
