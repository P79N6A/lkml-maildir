What is this, kindergarten? What false claims have I made? I pointed out
several you made, to which you had no rebuttal. Then you start playing
"Jens made obviously false claims", huh?? I've had more mature
conversations with my 1 year old son.
I'm sorry if you feel that me refuting your false statements are
personal attacks. Clearly not a problem that can be fixed at my end.
Ignoring facts and continuing to write the same wrong claims over and
over again doesn't make them true in the end.
Please take me off the cc list, thanks.
