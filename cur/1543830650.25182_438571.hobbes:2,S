Which brings us to a basic question.  Does it make sense to have
a define that completely disables namespace support.
I know all of the simple namespaces have been implemented like that,
and it was relatively easy there.  I'm not at all certain in the long
term we want a configuration option.  Especially if simply enabling
the code doesn't have an impact on performance.  Which I think is
a merge requirement anyway.
As for inet_addr_type and friends I do agree that implicit arguments
make for an easier implementation of CONFIG_NET_NS.  My gut feel
is though that the code with explicit arguments is probably more
comprehensible in the long term.  Especially as we find more weird
exceptions where the process we are running in does not have the correct
network namespace.
In general unnecessary CONFIG options are a problem because they make
the entire testing process much harder and make the code harder to
write (so that both cases work and work cleanly).
So my feeling is that we actually want to kill all of those CONFIG_XXX_NS
options.
Which simply leaves us with the problem of implementing the code cleanly.
