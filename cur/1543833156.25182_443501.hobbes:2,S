Hi,
I saw same message.
When GAM(Global Array Manager) is started, The following message output.
kernel: kernel unaligned access to 0xe0000001fe1080d4, ip=0xa000000200053371
The uioc structure used by ioctl is defined by packed,
the allignment of each member are disturbed.
In a 64 bit structure, the allignment of member doesn't fit 64 bit
boundary. this causes this messages.
In a 32 bit structure, we don't see the message because the allinment
of member fit 32 bit boundary even if packed is specified. 
patch
I Add 32 bit dummy member to fit 64 bit boundary. I tested.
We confirmed this patch fix the problem by IA64 server.
