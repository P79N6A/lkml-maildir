You probably can modify pci code to do that, but there is no reason for
you
to do it. Just ignore that message - your M5229 IDE reports that it
needs
some interrupt allocated to INTA. Fortunately IDE driver decided that
it should use IRQ 14 & 15 for this interface. So as long as it works, do
not pay any attention to biosirq message.
