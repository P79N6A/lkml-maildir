At least for the moment I don't think this is necessary.
Keep in mind that accessfs with the current ressource coverage
contains only entries which are static after initialization (except
for user-initiated permission changes of course), not like devfs where
entries are appearing, disappearing and reappearing all the time when
modules are loaded/unloaded etc. So a small shell script which sets
permissions once after boot should suffice in all cases (one could
also write a script which saves permissions on shutdown, to
automatically preserve changes made by the admin).
