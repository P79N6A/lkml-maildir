I don't think this is right. Prove me wrong by explaining how kswapd works,
but if a page isn't dirty, there is no need to write it out to disk.
My (perhaps incorrect) assumption is that kswapd prefers to swap on clean
pages over dirty pages. If your pages are mostly clean, there is nothing
to write to disk the clear majority of the time.
Clean read-only pages should *never* be written to swap. They can be re-read
from their source.
I _think_ what you are seeing is that kswapd is not cleaning pages out
fast enough, which means that *other* tasks executing need to have their
*swapped out* pages *read* from disk. I.e. the churning you hear is probably
mostly reads - not writes.
