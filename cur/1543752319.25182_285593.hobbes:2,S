Greetings;
I just bought a Sony HandyCam DCR-TRV460, which has both firewire and 
usb ports.
But I couldn't seem to open a path to it using usb, so I plugged in an 
old firewire card that has the TI-Lynx chipset on it.  Its recognized 
(apparently) by both dmesg and kudzu, but although I'd turned on all 
the 1394 stuff as modules when I got ready to plug the card in and 
rebuilt my 2.6.10-ac8 kernel, kudzu didn't load any of them, and when 
I try to, I'm getting "-1 Unknown Symbol in module" errors. 
Probably an attack of dumbass, but I'd appreciate any help that can be 
tossed my way.  ATM I'm rebuilding again with the base module built 
in.

Cheers, Gene
