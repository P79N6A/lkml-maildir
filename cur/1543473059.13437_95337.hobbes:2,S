After a few weeks of happily using IDE scsi emulation + scsi tape to run
my HP Colo 8GB tape under 2.1.125, I decided to try the latest kernel to
see if the problems with the IDE tape driver were fixed. Unfortunately,
they are still there. Is anyone working on this?
Here are the sort of messages I see, followed by tar quitting with an I/O
error. It happens irregularly, and only during large writes. It's an SMP
kernel, but (at least for 2.1.125) I confirmed that the problem also
happens in UP. The mainboard is an ASUS PL297DS.
