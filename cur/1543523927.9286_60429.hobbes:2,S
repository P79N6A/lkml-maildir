You might get better performance with an algorithm like this one.  Maybe
even better than bsrl on i386 -- I think bsrl is very slow on modern
chips.
  const static table [32] =
    { 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 
      5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 };
  size = (size - 1) >> PAGE_SHIFT; /* Let's assume it's 12. */
  if (size >= (1 << 10)) { size >>= 10; order += 10; }
  if (size >= (1 <<  5)) { size >>= 5 ; order += 5; }
  order += table [size];
The table has to go outside the function because of the way GCC
implements inline functions.  With a bit more typing, you can generalise
it for any PAGE_SHIFT and still have it optimise to the appropriate code
for a particular page size.
have a nice day,
