Hm, what compiler version are you using to get this warning?
This should not be happening (the usb_midi_ids are used in the
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() macro to export the info to userspace), and I
can't duplicate the warning here with gcc versions 3.3.1 or 2.96 (Red
Hat rawhide and Red Hat 7.3 respectively)
thanks,
