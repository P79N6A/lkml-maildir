This is much less frequent in 2.1 with the current uaccess.h
implementations of copy_from_user, copy_to_user, get_user, put_user.
At least on i386, these facilities cannot stomp on kernel memory no
matter *what* values the user specifies.
There were some problems around 2.1.77 or so with buggy sound driver
code that had lots of __get_user and __put_user.
In fact, I would advise someone who wants to do a security check of the
kernel (either a Good Guy or a Bad Guy) to make a list of the unchecked
functions in uaccess.h, grep the entire kernel source for these functions,
and validate all of the use cases.  They should all have explicit
constraint checks.
