I was wondering about multiple OS instances in their own address
space. What's the need for separate address spaces for the kernels ?
It looks more natural to me to _actually_ have N instances of kernel
data structures in the _same address space_, i.e. turning
each global variable into an array_ indexed by an "instance id",
much in the same way as we have now per-CPU structures. Well,
I don't actually think it would be as simple as stated above, I'm just
proposing it as a general approach towards ccclustering.
(btw, there was some discussion on #kernelnewbies, on Nov 12th and
21st, you can find the logs here
