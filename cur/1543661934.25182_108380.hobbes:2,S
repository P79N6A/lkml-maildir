No, it's not.  I keep you telling you LSM is not just about SELinux,
but I'm happy to say it again, if necessary.

Of course not.  Noone is saying that the LSM hooks alone give security;
rather, they enable you to install a module that gives security.
>security needs a careful design
You keep saying this.  People keep telling you that LSM does have a
careful design.  I suspect you mean that you don't like the design we
chose, for whatever reason -- but that's a different sort of beast,
isn't it?
If you have constructive suggestions, I'm listening.
