My inputs:
- I do not like pci_express_read implemented as inline function. It is 
called only in one place. It is more appropriate, on my opinion, to 
merge all stuff added to include/asm-i386/pci.h , into 
arch/i386/pci/direct.c.
- if you will present 4k config space for all devices, it will save lots 
of work: you do not need to modify struct pci_dev, do not need almost 
all stuff in drivers/pci/proc.c. By presenting 4k config for PCI device 
you should not broke anything.
- Here and in _write function:
+static int pci_express_conf_read(int seg, int bus,
+        int devfn, int reg, int len, u32 *value)
+{
+    if (!value || (bus > 255) || (devfn > 255) || (reg > 4095)) {
+        printk(KERN_ERR "pci_express_conf_read: "
+                    "Invalid Parameter\n");
Worth to use
         printk(KERN_ERR "%s: Invalid Parameter\n",__FUNCTION__);
