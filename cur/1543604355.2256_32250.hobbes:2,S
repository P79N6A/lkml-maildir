Couldn't this mess be solved with a module (optionally) containing a URL
to a source-code tarball? Modules that come with the kernel would point
to the relevant kernel sources on ftp.kernel.org.
This would alleviate all worry about things like closed-source BSD;
after all, anyone could check if there is source availible with wget.
