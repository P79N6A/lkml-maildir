Correct != comprehensible ;)
"In all journalling modes ext3 guarantees metadata consistency after a
 crash.  In its data=journal and data=ordered modes ext3 also guarantees that
 user data is consistent with metadata after a crash.
 However ext3 does not provide user data atomicity guarantees beyond the
 scope of a single filesystem disk block (usually 4 kilobytes).  If a
 single write() spans two disk blocks it is possible that a crash partway
 through the write will result in only one of those blocks appearing in the
 file after recovery"
