I can see the read/write batching being helpful there, at least to
prevent writes starving reads if you let the queue drain completely
before starting a new batch.
CFQ does something similar, just not batched together. But it does let
the depth build up a little and drain out. In fact I think I'm missing
a little fix there thinking about it, that could be why the read
latencies hurt on write intensive loads (the dispatch queue is drained,
the hardware queue is not fully).

I think we need to end up with something that sets the machine profile
for the interesting disks. Some things you can check for at runtime
(like the writes being extremely fast is a good indicator of write
caching), but it is just not possible to cover it all. Plus, you end up
with 30-40% of the code being convoluted stuff added to detect it.
