Hi there,
I have been trying to update a SMP machine to kernel 2.4, but I stubled over
the same problem over and over again:
With SMP enabled, the network card does neither send nor receive any data. There are
no error messages, but the card behaves just as if the cable was physically disconnected.
I have tried the de4x5 and the tulip driver with no success, and a 3c59x-card
with just the same problem.
The problem occurred on two identical dual-PPro machines, so hardware problems
should be excluded. Kernel 2.2.13 does work without problems. With SMP disabled,
the problem disappears. I have tried 2.4.18 as well as 2.4.19
Could anyone help me to find the correct person to contact about it?
Thanks,
Nobbi
