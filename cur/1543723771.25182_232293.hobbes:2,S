Ah, you want wakeup latency numbers.  Sorry, I don't have any.  I believe 
Andrew and Davide both wrote tools for measuring in the wild, a search of 
the archives should turn up something that will give you the numbers you're 
looking for.
If I'm understanding your question, no, there is no latency guarantee.

Yes.
