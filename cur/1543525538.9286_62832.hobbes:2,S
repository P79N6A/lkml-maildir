pppd (2.3.11) does not work with kernel 2.3.43. 
i patched straight from 2.3.41 to 2.3.43, and ended up with two
distinct differences:
	 1) no autolocation of the ppp_generic module,
	    even though this worked fine in 2.3.41. A manual modprobe
	    of ppp_generic works fine, and stops pppd from
	    complaining. 
	 2) more problematic:
Feb 12 15:39:17 dhin pppd[432]: ioctl(TIOCSETD(PPP)): Invalid argument(22)
and
Feb 12 15:40:13 dhin pppd[481]: ioctl(TIOCSETD): Invalid argument(22)
If I just reboot into 2.3.41, it works fine again. I looked over the
patch files for ppp-related stuff, but couldn't find anything that
leapt out at me as the cause of this.
Any ideas ?
