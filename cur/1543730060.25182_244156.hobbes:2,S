Hey! I built a primitive computer from one of those in a microprocessor 
class a year ago.  2 8-bit registers, 8-bit data-bus and 16-bit address 
bus.  There were two interrupt pins, IRQ and NMI, and a simple 
condition code register.  The CPU clock is the same as the bus clock.  
What fun!!!

A well designed guide could go a long way toward convincing companies 
to release specs.  When a well known hardware website has user 
testimonials that the drivers suck, the tech support are unhelpful, and 
the company just doesn't get it, said company will probably tend to 
listen.
