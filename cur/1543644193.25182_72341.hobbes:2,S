There are a number of issues here:
1) userspace has 3 GB space, kernel has the other 1 GB
2) if you want to mmap a file over and over again, you'll
   need to have the code that maps the file and the glibc
   mmap(3) stuff mapped into your address space ;)
3) your process will want to have a stack somewhere
4) address 0 is reserved to trap NULL pointer dereferences
   both in kernel and user space
cheers,
Rik
