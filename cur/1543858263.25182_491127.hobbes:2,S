Subject: [PATCH] Add support for Korenix 16C950-based PCI cards
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus, Andrew,
This patch adds initial support to 8250-pci for the Korenix Jetcard PCI
serial cards.  The JC12xx cards are standard RS232-based serial cards
utilising the Oxford 16C950 device.
The JC14xx are RS422/RS485-based cards, but in order for these to be
supported natively, we will need additional tweaks to the 8250 layers
so we can specify some values for the 950's registers.  Hence, these
two entries are commented out.
