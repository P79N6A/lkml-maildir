This is a problem that already exists, if two devices are at the same io 
address there is not much we can do. Autoprobe will pick up one first 
and the second is out of luck.
(or are you confusing bus_id with device_id?)

Nothing is being changed as far as this concerned. If you compile ne.c 
into your kernel you get autoprobe at 0x300.
