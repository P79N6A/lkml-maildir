Well they might be able to help themselves by recompiling (for
instance a BSD with advertising module) - this happens for
instance when functions become #define's and so forth - so
if you want full detail, at risk of #include <warandpeace.h>:
For modules without a GPL license:
 You are trying to load a module which has unresolved symbols. These
 symbols may not be exported by this version of the kernel (perhaps
 you have a version mismatch), or they may be exported GPLONLY,
 (in which case they will not be available to your module which does
 not carry a GPL compatible license). You may be able to fix
 this by recompiling the module against your current kernel's source;
 if this doesn't work, or you don't have module source code,
 contact *only* the module supplier for assistance; no one else
 can help you.
And the alternative version if the module DOES have a GPL license:
 You are trying to load a GPL licensed module which has unresolved
 symbols. These symbols may not be exported by this version of the
 kernel (perhaps you have a version mismatch). You may be able to fix
 this by obtaining the source code for the module, and recompiling it
 against your current kernel's source.
