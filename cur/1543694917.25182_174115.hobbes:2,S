Hi,
I've released the 004 version of udev.  It can be found at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-004.tar.gz
Thanks to Robert Love, there are now rpms available at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-004-1.i386.rpm
with the source rpm at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-004-1.src.rpm
udev is a implementation of devfs in userspace using sysfs and
/sbin/hotplug.  It requires a 2.6 kernel to run properly.
The major changes since the 003 release are:
	- MAJOR speedups over the previous version.  No more "sleep(1)"
	  always, we now wait for the "dev" file to show up, and not
	  blindly guess.
	- partitions now work again.
	- removal of devices that were named differently from the kernel
	  name work properly.
	- proper spec file.
	- a man page with real content.
	- sync up with current version of libsysfs.
Many thanks to Dan Stekloff, Kay Sievers, and Robert Love for their help
with patches for this release.  I really appreciate it.
The full ChangeLog can be found below.
The udev FAQ can be found at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-FAQ
Development of udev is done in a BitKeeper tree available at:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/udev/
If anyone ever wants a snapshot of the current tree, due to not using
BitKeeper, or other reasons, is always available at any time by asking.
thanks,
greg k-h
