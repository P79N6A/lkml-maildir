Really,
I spent more than an hour on the phone with SuSE-US's President discussing
many subjects.  Since I just reviewed 6.1, there were a few desired
suggestions I offered to Mr. Marc Torres.  You really should adjust the
tone from "tell" to "inform/suggest".  He is a man that listens intently
on well thought I deals.

I gather there was a minor puzzle in YaST, but if you have used SuSE since
5.3 you should have an idea how to work YaST to make it do what you want.
I last installed 5.0 to review.

Now hold up.  Are you not primary SCSI, or is my vision/memory blurring.
Resend the missed logs, and we'll start over.
Let's not point to SuSE until we resolve a hardware question or two.
