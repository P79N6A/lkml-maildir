Ah, ok... this is just a terminology issue.  I'm not really familiar with
a 'true capabilities-based system', but I am familiar with how
'capability lists' are designed to work under Linux.  What bothers me is
that the setuid-root scheme doesn't correctly implement capabilities, and
that correct semantics are being broken to work around limitations in the
design.  So, when I've been saying 'true capabilities support' I've meant
'true support for capability lists as implemented in the Linux kernel'.
I'll probably continue to misuse the terminology, but I hope you
understand.

I'm interested in why you think it's fundamentally broken.  In the design
issues I'm considering, it seems at _worst_ to be much better than the
current root=all powerful model.  I've already given one example of
securing named(8) with the capability lists support.

Well, I've got a bit of a learning curve ahead of me with kernel hacking;
if for some reason you don't think the Linux implementation of capability
lists will result in enormously improved security (when implemented and
used properly), then it would be nice to know why _now_.
cheers,
