	No.

	So that other memory mapped busses such as ISA and sbus
can use them.
	USB devices should do DMA operations with respect to their USB
host adapters, typically a PCI device.  For example, imagine a machine
with two USB controllers on different bus instances.
	One of these days, I'd like to add "struct device *dma_dev;" to
struct request_queue to facilitate optional centralization of
dma_{,un}map_sg for most hardware drivers.  PCI scsi controllers, for
example would set dma_dev to the PCI device.  USB scsi controllers
would set it to the USB host adapter.
