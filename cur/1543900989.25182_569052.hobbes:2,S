Subject: [PATCH] change SysRq keycode for systems without SysRq key
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/13/414

this patch adds an entry in Kconfig after 'config MAGIC_SYSRQ' which
asks for a different keycode (replacing also KEY_SYSRQ with
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ_KEYCODE in char/keyboard.c)
it was tested on some USB keyboards (Microsoft and Apple USB keyboards,
and it works)
I sumbitted this patch two years ago, but it was ignored.
I think this patch is very important, even to a non-developer (SysRq-k
is very helpful when testing unstable software/drivers)
