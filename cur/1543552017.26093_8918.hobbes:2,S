Subject: bind() allowed to non-local addresses

Using linux-2.4.0-test9, bind() incorrectly allows a bind to a non-local
address.  The correct behavior should be a return code of -1 with errno
set to EADDRNOTAVAIL.  (Simple snippet to reproduce/debug the problem is
available on request)
There appears to be significant differences between the
net/ipv4/af_inet.c:inet_bind() in the 2.2 and 2.4 sources.  The
inet_bind() in the 2.2 sources contains a check to ensure that the value
returned by inet_addr_type() is RTN_LOCAL as well as a #ifdef'ed check
to allow the bind in certain cases if the kernel was compiled with
transparent proxy is enabled.  In inet_bind() of the 2.4 tree all of
these checks are conspicuously absent.
The following patch fixes the problem for me, but I am still concerned
possibly breaking transparent proxy.  Basically the patch is nothing
more than the addition of a simple check for RTN_LOCAL. (Moving call to
inet_addr_type() is a *very* nit-picky "optimization" that eliminates
wasted time in the call in the event that subsequent port and capability
check fails).
