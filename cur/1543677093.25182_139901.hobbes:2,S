Unfortunately even a perfect backport seems to be only a partial solution 
-- the ATI binary only drivers don't seem to know how to talk to the 2.5 
AGP 3.0 stuff anyway (well, at least they didn't work at all when I tried 
them under the 2.5 kernel :-/), and as they are lame binary-only drivers 
there is no way to fix that. 
There are also no other drivers for the R300-series Radeon GPUs. :-(
This absolutely sucks, but turning the card into an AGP 2.0 card seems to 
be the only surefire way to get it to work properly under Linux. :-(
