And vtun's script in debian doesn't, so that I had to load it by hand.
Don't justify lack of support thanks to corrections that people had to
add ;)
The problem I'm raising is that with udev we seem to be heading to
asking every program to know which module it should load by hand before
being able to use a /dev entry. This looks odd to me (why not opening
the /dev entry itself shouldn't autoload the driver?).
