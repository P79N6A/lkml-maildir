Hi Andrew! Al! Folks!
The following set of patches extends the per device 
'noatime', 'nodiratime' and last but not least the 
'ro' (read only) mount option to the vfs --bind mounts, 
allowing them to behave like any other mount, by 
honoring those mount flags (which are silently ignored 
by the current implementation in 2.4.x and 2.6.x)   	
the patch makes the following syscall variations behave 
as expected:
 - open (read/write/trunc), create
 - link, symlink, unlink
 - mknod (reg/block/char/fifo)
 - mkfifo, mkdir, rmdir, rename
 - (f,l)chown, (f)chmod, utime
 - access, truncate, mmap
 - ioctl (gen/ext2/ext3/reiser)
 - (f,l)setxattr, (f,l)removexattr
an older version of this patch was included in 
2.6.0-test6-mm2, and v2.6.4-wolk2.0, the patches were
used by several people, without any issues ...
please consider inclusion (in -mm ?) and/or let me know
what needs to be changed to get this functionality into
mainline ...
patches are against 2.6.11-rc4 but they do apply fine
against 2.6.11-rc4-bk9 (so no modification required)
TIA,
Herbert
(all six patches are)
