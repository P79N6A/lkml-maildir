Last year, at the Realtime linux workshop, there was a paper about 
running Linux on a machine with 2Mb of RAM + 2Mb of Flash. They even 
manage to boot in 1 second! Nevertheless, they had to do several 
modifications to achieve this. Maybe with the new options in the 2.6 
kernel, it would be easier...
