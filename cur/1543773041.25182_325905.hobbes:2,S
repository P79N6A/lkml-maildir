Subject: [PATCH linux-2.6.12-rc6-mm1] blk: cfq_find_next_crq fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

 Hello, Jens.
 Hello, Andrew.
 In cfq_find_next_crq(), cfq tries to find the next request by
choosing one of two requests before and after the current one.
Currently, when choosing the next request, if there's no next request,
the next candidate is NULL, resulting in selection of the previous
request.  This results in weird scheduling.  Once we reach the end, we
always seek backward.
 The correct behavior is using the first request as the next
candidate.  cfq_choose_req() already has logics for handling wrapped
requests.
