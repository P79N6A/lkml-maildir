The silence is deafening, eh?
From a quick peruse of the patch, it *looks* very good; factoring out the
interface code makes the actual drivers much cleaner, IMHO.
I tried patching a clean 2.2.7 kernel with it, and it oopsed as I was
logging in for the first time (on the USB keyboard). This is on a Pentium
system, VX chipset, with an IBM buckling spring AT keyboard, a macally
iKey USB keyboard+hub, a Kensington USB mouse, and a Logitech serial mouse
(shouldn't affect anything) hooked up.  Distribution is Redhat 6.0. I have
some serious doubts as to how accurately this oops was decoded, since I
couldn't get a dump of /proc/ksyms, plus I copied it down by hand (and you
don't want to see my handwriting). 
Note: the USB keyboard still worked for magic sysrq after the rest of the
system was down. Hope that helps.
