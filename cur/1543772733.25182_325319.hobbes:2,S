I can roll another hotplug release any time you want, there's nothing
holding that back.
But please, don't break old users of hotplug or udev.  Especially
hotplug (for udev one can argue that it's still so new that upgrading is
realistic, but try to prevent that too...) as that package is so tightly
tied to the distro, the next time it would be upgraded is for the next
distro release.
So, any way to not break anything?
thanks,
