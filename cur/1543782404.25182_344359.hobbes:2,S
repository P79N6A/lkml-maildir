Err, the Cyclone does not generate interrupts. So this issue does not
affect those systems.
As for the HPET, it sets its own interrupt frequency based off of
KERNEL_TICK_USEC (which you're right, isn't quite what is used in the
jiffies conversions).  Would it be easier to just adjust that value to
use ACTHZ or CLOCK_TICK_RATE?
