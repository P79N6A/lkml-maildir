You are mistaken, again.  Statement (B) is default construction of
var, followed by construction of a temporary "someclass(1)", followed
by assignment of that temporary to var, followed by destruction of the
temporary.  The compiler may elide the contruction and destruction of
the temporary under many circumstances; but the semantics are clear
nonetheless.

Static type checking with knowledge of inheritance; forced
construction and destruction; convenience.  (C already has adequate
static type checking if you use composition instead of inheritance.)

You are mistaken, again.  This is 100% ANSI C++.  I wrote it with the
ANSI standard open in another window.

It is _exactly_ changing the nature of an object (not a class, but I
think that's just a typo on your part).  Consider that we may choose
to define a constructor for Derived2 that omits the initialization of
member variables, thus inheriting previous values from Derived1.
