Dear Ingo,
I agree that it should be (and is now) possible to use system calls from
within system calls (i.e. by going through int 0x80 via _syscallX().
However, some of the examples you give have nothing to do with this issue.

yes, reusing the methods that filesystems (or others) provide is a good
thing. Going through int 0x80 is *also* a good thing. But they are two
completely different things.

Yes, but you have not shown a single case of calling system calls from
within system calls (or from withing any other part of the kernel) via
sys_XXX functions. I presume there are none (on i386 architecture)?
All I said is that if the kernel wants to call a system call then it
should go through _syscallX() macros. All known to me examples do just
that. (but on alpha they do call sys_XXX() functions which is a bit
inconsistent but I am sure there is a reason for that).
Of course the examples you gave are valid usages of kernel functions
via indirect pointers but NOT of using the system calls.
