Rodolfo,
I am eager to see an "official" USB driver. I have used a patch I found 
on the web that was attributed to you for 2.6.20 in our recent project. 
It patched cleanly and has worked fairly well. I am busy with other 
projects right now but might be able to squeeze some time to test on our 
board.
We have a custom PXA 270 board and we are moving to the PXA 320. I was 
very concerned that we have no 270 driver in mainline and no hope of a 
320 driver.
Regards,
