They allow CF8/CFC to access ECS in cases where mmcfg is not working.

Right, we need to be able to "correctly access the full config space".

Sure, on the bus we should only see pci configuration requests in both
cases.
To summarize it:
- mmcfg needs support by BIOS ("PCI services in ACPI")
- CF8/CFC ECS access does not have that dependency
- For base configuration space access we already have two methods -
  type 1 and mmcfg  (type1 as fallback if there is no mmcfg).
- So what's the benefit in not allowing CF8/CFC ECS  access ("extended type1")
  if the hardware supports it and if mmcfg is not suitable?
One thing that comes out of that fruitless discussion:
For IBS Robert might have to implement CF8/CFC ECS access directly in the IBS
code, or in a new driver for ECS access of NB functions. Just to ensure that
IBS is working if there is no mmcfg. And this is kind of ugly.

Andreas
