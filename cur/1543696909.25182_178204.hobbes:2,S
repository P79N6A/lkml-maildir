Yes exactly. Fundamentally I want *anybody*, without restriction, to ge able 
to pull and update sources from any open-source project hosted with bk.
The requirements are the equivalent functionality to:
lobobk clone ...
lobobk -r co
lobobk pull
lobobk export -r tag dest
Ie, Get a local clone of the repo, Be able to keep it updated, checkout the 
head version and export any particular tagged version.
and absolutely nothing else.
Not necessary, but if the cloned repo  was complete enough to be recloned, It 
would also make the perfect tool for anyone wanting to host a coherent mirror 
of the repo. Which takes us full circle I believe :)
