Subject: [PATCH] ppc64: Fix __raw_* IO accessors
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi !
Linus, I don't know if you did that on purpose, but you removed the
"volatile" statement from the definition of the __raw_* IO accessors
on ppc64, which cause some real bad optisations to happen in some
fbdev's like matroxfb to happen (just imagine that matroxfb loops
reading an IO register waiting for a bit to change).
(Note: matroxfb has other potential problems due to the fact that
__raw_* do not do any barrier (Petr, we probably need to fix that
some way, unfortunatley, I don't think we have a good abstraction
for providing the missing barrier to a driver using __raw... can't
you just switch back to little endian registers and use normal
readX/writeX ?)
Anyway, here's the fix for asm-ppc64/io.h
