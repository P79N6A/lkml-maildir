It would appear the kernel is not properly reporting all the active sockets.
I noticed this in 2.5.70 while checking netflow collection... udp port 9800
is bound and actively receiving traffic, however, nothing reports it's
existance.  2.6.0-test4 still has this bug.
This smells like a simple "off by one" bug, but I've been too busy to go
look at the code.
