The fan/heatsink wasn't glued to my boards at least (I have two of
those). You just have to squeeze the plastic things on the back
of the board and it'll go off. I had a fan on mine. You?
All ports are USB 2.0. What you're missing is that you (afaik) use
UHCI to talk to USB 1.1 devices (1.5 and 12Mbit/s) and EHCI to talk
to USB 2.0 devices (up to 480Mbit/s). It should just work
out of the box. Try inserting a USB 2.0 device into each port and
see what it says. It works as USB 2 here with my Creative Zen NX
and I tried a few ports. THe only thing that isn't USB2 is the
card reader package that you got in the box. It's USB1.1 only.
