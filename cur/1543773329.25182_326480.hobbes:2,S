Hi all,
what do you think about this simple idea of a script that could help
users to fill better BUG reports ?
The usage is quite simple, put the attached file in
/usr/src/linux/scripts and then:
[root@frodo scripts]# ./report-bug.sh /tmp/BUGREPORT/
cat: /proc/scsi/scsi: No such file or directory
[root@frodo scripts]# ls /tmp/BUGREPORT/
cpuinfo.bug  ioports.bug  modules.bug  software.bug
iomem.bug    lspci.bug    scsi.bug     version.bug
Now you can simply attach all the .bug files to the bugzilla report or
inline them in a email.
The script is rude but it is enough to give you an idea of what I have in mind.
Any comment ?
