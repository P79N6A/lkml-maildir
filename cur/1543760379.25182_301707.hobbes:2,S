If you can send in a patch that fixes it in an obvious way and in less
than 100 lines of context diff, hell yes.
Remember: all the other constraints still hold. Don't fall into the trap 
of believing that "if it fixes a regression, it's for -stable". It needs 
to be _obvious_, and it needs to be small enough that bugs are unlikely.
And that "small enough" is really important. Bugs do happen. Even in 
"obvious" patches. The whole _point_ of -stable is to try to make them 
less likely, and the strict constraints are very much a part of that.
