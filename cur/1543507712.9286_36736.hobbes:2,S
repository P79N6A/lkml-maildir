Would it not be more sensible to introduce a syscall or some such thing to
do it? Surely having the kernel format up nice tables for /proc, and then
applications reading and parsing it all back again, is a bit pointless. Leave
the files in /proc for humans. We've got sysctl for tunable parameters,
is there a parallel that could be used for read-only info?
