You'll have no trouble if things *need* to be balanced, because
that would imply the runqueue length average is significantly
above the lengths of other runqueues.
As far as the extra test goes, it's really a miniscule overhead
compared with the fork / clone cost itself, and can be really
worthwhile if we get it right.

Well it may be brain-dead, but if people use them (and they do)
then I would really be interested to see results.
I did testing with some things like apache and volanomark, however
I was not able to make out much difference on my setups. Though
obviously that's not to say that there won't be with other software
or other workloads / architectures etc.
