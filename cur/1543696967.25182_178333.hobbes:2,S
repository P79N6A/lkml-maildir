that doesn't help.  As I am aware, the seq_file structure is only
allocated in the seq_open() call.  How does seq_open() know which
private data (i.e. hash table) to associate with struct file?
The only moment I know which htable corresponds to a proc entry is at
the time where I call proc_net_create() [or a similar function].  So the
information would need to be associated with the dentry or whatever...
seq_file() is allocated way too late.
