Thanks :)
Note that (speaking technically) the SII libata driver doesn't mask all
interrupt conditions, which is why it's listed under CONFIG_BROKEN.  So
this translates to "you might get a random lockup", which some users
certainly do see.
For other users, the libata SII driver works flawlessly for them...
