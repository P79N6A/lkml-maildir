Hi Linus,
Hi LKML people,

For this we need a block remapper layer that can map any
blocksize n to any blocksize m with only the following constraints:
   - n and m are powers of 2
   - n is a multiple of m
Both should use the page cache ( of size p) of course, so it
becomes 2 layers, if n > p.
   -  translating a buffer of n into some pages
   -  translating a page into buffers of m (current buffercache)
We could limit the translation to 5 powers of 2 obove and 5 powers of 2
below PAGE_CACHE_SIZE so that we can maintain a validity bitmap
(2^5 = 32 bits) for each layer if access is too expensive[1].
Some subsystems could certainly benefit from it.
   -  loop device (with all the crypto stuff)
   -  LVM
   -  FSes that support block sizes != PAGE_CACHE_SIZE
   -  Devices with blocksize != 512 (they don't have to care
      being special anymore). There are even some rumors
      about very pervert blocksizes of 1M and the like.
Since these remapped buffers will look like merged requests, I
see even no problems with the elevator any more.
The question is, where we implement this infrastructure, esp. if
we consider the last user (devices with blocksize != 512).
This has to be answered by the main architects of Linux before
anyone could start.

Daniel (and others) uses ext2 as as a playground, because it is
implemented, tested and not that hard to understand and verify.
Hope they will switch to some own design later, once they
sufficiently played around with^W^W^Wtested their ideas.

[1] In buffer cache we use read-modify-write for partial pages,
   which hurts performance for them and is annoying for media
   with limited write cycles like flash and CD-RW[2].
[2] Yes I know about packet writing mode ;-)
