Hi all,
I am running 2.4.21-rc2-ac2 with a radeonfb and dri. If ACPI is
enabled the power of 2.4 GHz Intel i686 is reduced to minimum the half. 
The acpi modules of 2.4.20 are working perfect in that constellation.
(Need that for power off at shutdown). DRI and XF86 4.3.0 are
running much better than the ati-drivers.
BTW: Which kernel-params do I need to start radeonfb with
video:radeonfb=1280x1024-16@75 ? The FB even starts with 
colour frame buffer device 80x30.
Any hints?
Ciao
Elimar
