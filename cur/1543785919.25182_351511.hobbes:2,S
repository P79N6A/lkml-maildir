Subject: [PATCH 09/12] HPPFS: add special permission checking from procfs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Procfs uses a special permission method in some cases, so we can't use the
generic one, and must call instead the inode's one if it's not null (only
some inodes use a custom method).
It seems that this method is used to avoid a chroot'ed process to escape
its chroot by accessing another process's root/cwd through procfs (both by
a quick read of the code and by testing on the host), like in "cd
/proc/1/root".
I've not added a ->permission operation on symlink, as there is no procfs
symlink using it, and I wonder if symlink can have permissions set at all
(guess not).
If you disagree, just add it (hppfs_permission() handles null pointers
gracefully).
Note: I've cared to use the proc inode (I missed that in the beginning) -
since the dentry is always created by the underlying ->lookup this should be
safe - or not? I've gone to do some checking, and since we pass to it a
procfs inode, referring to the procfs superblock, it seems that yes, we're
fine.
