Hm, CDROM works correctly EXCEPT for ejecting.
From my bootup messages you can see that CDROM is correctly
recognized, and that I successfully mounted two CD-s (so far):
hdc: TOSHIBA CD-ROM XM-6102B, ATAPI CDROM drive
hdc: ATAPI 24X CDROM drive, 256kB Cache
Uniform CDROM driver Revision: 2.52
VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,0)
VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,0)
ISO 9660 Extensions: Microsoft Joliet Level 3
ISO 9660 Extensions: RRIP_1991A
It's only that I have to press button to eject them, where I used to
type "eject", and it worked correctly few days (weeks?), ago on the
same setup.
