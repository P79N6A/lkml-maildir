Oh yes, I understand your problem, I went through that for several years with
2.4. Another advantage of many small updates is that the risk of conflict is
minor, and your users might often be able to apply the official patch *after*
your patch, which is very convenient.
Maybe you should just run a cron script to patch your kernels everytime a
new fix goes out, so that you'll at least be able to reply to your users
whether it's supposed to work or not.
