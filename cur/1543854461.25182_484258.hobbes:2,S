Correct; this is no different than modifying ->fsuid temporarily.

I don't see any value added by introducing yet another field for the
create SID (unlike the actor SID, where we need to distinguish it for
certain checks where the task is the target rather than the actor), so I
don't advocate this approach.
I still suspect that the task flag approach would have been rather
simpler...
