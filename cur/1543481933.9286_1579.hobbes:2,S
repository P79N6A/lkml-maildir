beq / bne have three operands, two registers that are being compared and one
branch target.  There also is a register that is hardwired to zero, so
branches based on a comparison with zero are just as fast as with any other
number.  That's for both Alpha and MIPS.
MIPS FPUs are a bit different, they rely on a status register which has one
status bit (MIPS I - III) or eight (MIPS IV instruction set).  Compare
instructions set or clear such a flag.  The branch instructions then can
branch depending on wether such a flag is set or cleared.  MIPS IV allows to
specify for compares and branches which of the flags should be used by an
instruction.  Dunno about the Alpha, the Alpha manuals is 3m away from here
and I won't get up from my warm bed for just that :-)
