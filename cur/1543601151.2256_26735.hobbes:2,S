Hmmm...  I've tried the patch with 2.4.8, 2.4.8-ac12, and 2.4.9-ac8.  All
three says "couldn't find the kernel version the module was compiled for"
when insmod tries to load the ipconfig module.  I've also tried different
versions of insmod(2.4.0, 2.4.2, and 2.4.8).  I have not yet tried your
kernel yet since I'm working with pcmcia devices, but I'll give it a try
as well, just to see if ipconfig would load or not.
Anyone else here have a clue?
