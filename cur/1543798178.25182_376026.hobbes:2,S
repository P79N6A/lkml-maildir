The vast majority of ups and downs are actually mutex related not semaphore
related, so by majority share, up/down perhaps ought to be repurposed to
mutexes: they _are_ the preeminent uses.
From my modified tree, I see:
	semaphore	up	down	down_in	down_try
	Counting	41	59	1	0
	Mutex		4405	2824	362	107

Whilst that is true, they're in a small minority, and it'd be easier to change
them.
