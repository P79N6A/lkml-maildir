Sorry to follow up my own post, but I misspoke here.  I do have this problem 
solved, but not in a way that strace would find useful.
The user-mode port has enough control over its processes that it can simulate 
a fork.  So, what the tracer does is null out the fork, call clone itself, and 
impose the proper state on the new child.
This works because tracer and tracee are in the same address space, and 
obviously doesn't cut it for strace.
