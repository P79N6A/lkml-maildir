2.6.12 should be old enough, but maybe if you could try 2.6.9 that would
definitely be old enough to rule out recent airo changes.

You get to either install windows on your laptop, or pull the card
(pcmcia or minipci, either way) and put it into a windows computer.

Do you know which kernel version that patch first appeared in?

Could be, it would be quite helpful to get the version of firmware you
are using.  Versions earlier than 5.30.17 are known not be flaky or even
not work with newer Linux kernel drivers since Cisco changed the
firmware interface in that version.  That said, I've seen cards in the
5.00.xx range work with the latest drivers, but not well.  These older
firmware versions sometimes lock up sponaneously and require a reboot,
updating to later firmware post-5.30.17 fixes that problem.

That would be a great idea, let us know what the results are, especially
if you cna figure out which firmware version you have, or if the card
itself is really just dead.
