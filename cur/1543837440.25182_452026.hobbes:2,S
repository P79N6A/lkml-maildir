Real SCSI for a developer, for a user it's USB.
And things become even more confusing considering that the drive might 
show up as /dev/sda or /dev/uba depending on the driver used.

You are talking about kernel<->kernel and kernel<->hardware interfaces.
I'm more concerned about the kernel<->userspace interface.

Or by adding some manual links if using a static /dev.
But I'm still not getting the point why the /dev/sd* namespace has to be
