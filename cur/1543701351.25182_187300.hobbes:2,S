If you are serious about this, we have tons of good ideas, and tons of 
suggestions on how to avoid bad ideas :)
OpenCores (
http://www.opencores.org/
) might be a good place to start, as 
they already have a 10/100 ethernet MAC which is working, and has been 
silicon'd:  
http://www.opencores.org/projects/ethmac/
  Full "source" for 
the MAC is available, in VHDL I think.  OpenCores also has PCI VHDL and 
other glue you may need.
You'll definitely want to implement autonegotiation.  It's a showstopper 
without that.  And if it's not gigabit ethernet, it's already outdated. 
  So it's a tough challenge.
Once you have basic gigabit ethernet working with 10/100/1000 
autonegotiation, let us know, and we'll pelt you with good suggestions :)

You don't need an NDA, but you do need to pay US$50 or so for the specs. 
  Or a nice person might just send them to you :)
