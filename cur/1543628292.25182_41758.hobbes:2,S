This is almost right and I can see there is some confusion, so here's
son technical info in the midst of this, err, "discussion" :-)
If you want to send a regular style patch
	bk export -tpatch -r+		# send most recent changeset
	bk import -tpatch		# accept regular patch
If you want to send BK style patches
	bk send user@host.com
	bk receive
NOTE! bk send will send *everything* it has not already sent to that 
email address, i.e., the whole tree.  See the "bk help send" docs for
info on how to tell BK that the user already has part of the tree.
