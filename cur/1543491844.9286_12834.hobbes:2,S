I have a curious problem with APM with both 2.0.36 and 2.2.4 which may
or may not be related to yours.
The symptoms are clear enough though: The battery charge level is fine
until it drops below 35%, but as soon as it drops below that point, it
continuously reads 0% and I get spammed with battery low warnings on
ALL consoles (logged in or not) AND all telnet sessions, with
something like four or five copies of the message a second, and the
system becomes completely unusable in Linux.
However, if I then boot across to Windows 95, the system becomes quite
usable again, with battery power levels showing up as a reasonable 34%
and no spam at all. This state continues until the battery power level
reports around 3% at which point Windows 95 forces a shutdown.
I hate to say it, but in this respect, Windows 95 appears to be
superior to Linux...
If suggestions on this front are welcome, then mine would be to limit
messages about low battery status to (a) not more than one a minute,
and (b) the active console only. That way, the operator has a chance
to shut the system down properly !!!
Best wishes from Riley.
