I'm wondering if this is a kernel issue.  I have a bunch of headless
machines running, and until recently I was running them all w/o keyboards
attached.  Then I noticed that the newer machines(Athlon's) became unusable
on the network w/o a keyboard.  The onlder machines with ps/2 connectors
seem to work fine as do the older style AT machines.  I don't know if this
is a problem with the motherboards, with the kernel(stock 2.2.14-5 on all of
them) or something else.
