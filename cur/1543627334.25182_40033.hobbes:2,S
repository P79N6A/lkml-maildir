Doing
 $ find . -name 'zlib.c'
on the Linux 2.4.18 source reveals the three zlibs
  ./fs/jffs2/zlib.c
  ./drivers/net/zlib.c
  ./arch/ppc/boot/lib/zlib.c
Further checking reveals that ./arch/ppc/boot/lib/zlib.c is based on
zlib-0.95, while the other two are zlib-1.0.4.
Which one should I use? Shouldn't they be merged? And what about the
double-free() bug?
