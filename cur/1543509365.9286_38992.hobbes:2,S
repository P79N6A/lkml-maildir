I had a working 2.0.30 and wanted to upgrade to 2.0.35 .
I choosed the hard way .
I started with the 2.0 and patched up to the 2.0.35 .
Then I wanted to build the 2.0.35 an I got errors .
The wrong files were :
/usr/src/linux/scripts/mkdep.c
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/lib/delay.S
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/lib/semaphore.S
after the patching they contained several copies of the original file 
, I cleaned these files and then the build went well .
I would like to know if someone has already got such a problem and 
what can be the source of it .
Thank you to all of you
Paolo Savron
