Just a bug report.  Using tar to create an archive on a SCSI tape works
fine, but attempts to read from the tape end in system load going
through the roof when the operation is finished (i.e.. we have read all
the files, now we just need to close the device or something like
that).  I wish I could be of more help, let me know what I can do to fix
this.
