I was willing to accept that there might be an exploitable security 
issue taking more than 100 lines to plug the hole (remember, check your 
elegance at the door), and I like your suggestion regardless of length. 
But I don't think any more exceptions are desirable. As you said, "see 
below."

I have the feeling that drivers will need some special consideration, 
like allowing additions to an existing blacklist to prevent "almost 
working" with similar but not identical chips and the like.

Right problem, wrong solution. What you is that SOME solution go in 
mainline. My example above of adding a chipset to a blacklist is a 
perfect case, where you want the chipset to become supported, not long 
term "officially unsupported." And band-aids like using the BKL or long 
linear searches just to prevent something which causes a hard hang or 
oops should not be blessed and included in mainline.
I know you understand this, I just think it's worth saying more clearly.

Different in function as well as style. Testing complex patches can be 
done in -mm, reliable is often easier than optimal.

I can't imagine anyone not using a good patch in mainline, I can imagine 
some really brute force patches in stable, because they are easier to 
vat than a really correct solution.

I was actually thinking that the normal patch might want a fast path in 
practice. Some things are clearly wrong, like off by one errors in array 
handling and the like, using pointers to freed data or which could be 
null, that kind of thing is pretty unsubtle, and I would think would 
need fewer eyes-on. But until we see how this works in practice, let's 
not fix it. The stable kernel should have a stable process, which should 
not be changed unless there's a demonstrated problem.
