Hi Nathan, thanks for the feedback! This is indeed a false alarm. The tool
was able to infer the semantics of _sv_wait, but failed to used it due to
a bug in my checker... Problem fixed now and I will rerun the checker
tonight. I will update the error reports when the results are ready. 
Best,
Yichen
