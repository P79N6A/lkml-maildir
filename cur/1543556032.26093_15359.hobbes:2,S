Not so broken. I use it under SMP 2.2.18-pre23 and works fine. But under 2.4
hangs. So I think it is something that changed between 2.2 and 2.4 (locking
granularity???). And just hangs your box, does not corrupt anything.
It is a pitty that any piece of copylefted code prevents nVivia of giving all
of the drivers in source form.
