Based on my measurements, the "process_load" processes run at a
dynamic priority of 115--122.  Which is also pretty much the dynamic
priority range of the gcc processes.  At a certain point, the vanilla
Linux scheduler may select either a process_load process or a gcc/make
process to run, depending on which current runnable task has the
highest dynamic priority.
With swap-sched enabled, the virtual runnable tasks (tasks that are
blocked because of waiting for another task) are kept in runqueue. 
For example, if a contest process_load task A with prio 115 blocks on
waiting for another contest task B with prio 122, task A will remain
in runqueue.  Task A may be selected by the vanilla scheduler to run
since it has a high priority. On noticing that A is a virtual runnable
task, swap-sched further select B to run in place of A. So in the end,
B will be select to run. Without swap-sched, A will be removed from
the runqueue once it's blocked, and task B can hardly get a chance to
run since it has a low priority. That's why at
http://swap-sched.sourceforge.net/node9.html,
 process_load has a much
higher LCPU% when swap-sched is enabled.
