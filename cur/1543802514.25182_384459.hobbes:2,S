Well, a bit before that -- it takes a while for the softlockup timer to 
trigger. Yes and no, the machine's 'dead' while this is happening but in 
the end (minutes) it does recover in so far that it's no longer trying 
(but does leave around a cdparanoia in D state). Yes, I reboot, and then 
  things work again, until... well, they do not, which is quickly with 
the SG_IO patched cdparanoia.
It's probably more useful to test with a very minimal CDDA extraction 
tool using SG_IO, if Jens has any such tool lying around, and if anyone 
_wants_ me to test. As said, I personally just switched back to using 
regular cdparanoia, which is working fine for me.
Rene.
