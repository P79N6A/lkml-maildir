I think you have it fundamentally backwards: the best for performance is 
WB + cflush. What would WC offer for performance that cflush cannot do?
also, it's irrelevant to change_page_attr() call frequency. Just map in 
everything from the card and use it. In graphics, if you remap anything 
on the fly and it's not a slowpath you've lost the performance game even 
before you began it.
