Oops. Weird, it worked on my machines.
Sorry for the problems and thanks for tracking it down
I will look at it.  Andrew, probably just back it out for now.
Badari, Can you send me the beginning of your boot.msg again so that
I can see your node layout?  (you probably did already, but I cannot
find the mail anymore)
