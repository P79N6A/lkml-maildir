It shouldnt matter. If its entirely tied to ISA bus performance you should
be able to run it on 486 quite honestly.

or hang a small CPU on it and shove it on USB since USB can do isosynchronous

And quite a few chipsets steal cycles for other things (memory refresh, ram
thermal limiting and the like). With the Z85230 driver which also at high
speed really tests ISA bus throughput I regularly saw PCI boxes getting
worse performance  than ancient all ISA relics. Throughput was also comparable
between a K5 and a PII/233

The problems with the IO apic are generally bios, however there is one 
concern I have. APIC is a message passing bus so doesnt have a guaranteed
delivery time.
