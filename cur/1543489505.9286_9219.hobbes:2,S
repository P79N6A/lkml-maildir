Now you have me confused. :(
The original post was a collection of different matches for the kernel
aliases ppp-compress-21 etc.  As I understood it, the question boils down to
"which alias is supposed to go with which kernel module?"
Your reply seems to cover when to use each module rather than what the alias
to be used  for that module supposed to be.
Does your reply mean that it is irrelevant which the base alias used for
each module is as long as the compression modules desired for the connection
are loaded?
Thanks,
Lourdes
