well, look at /usr/include/linux/ppp-comp.h
you'll see :
#define CI_PREDICTOR_1          1       /* config option for Predictor-1 */
#define CI_PREDICTOR_2          2       /* config option for Predictor-2 */
#define CI_BSD_COMPRESS         21      /* config. option for BSD-Compress */
#define CI_DEFLATE              24      /* config option for Deflate */    
thus  /etc/conf.modules might contain:
alias ppp-compress-21 bsd_comp
alias ppp-compress-24 ppp_deflate
i don't know what ppp-compress-1 stands for exactly. so i would put it off
to turn off the messages (maybe someone could explain ?)
alias ppp-compress-1 off
the same goes for net-pf-3, in /usr/include/socketbits.h
#define PF_AX25         3       /* Amateur Radio AX.25.  */
#define PF_IPX          4       /* Novell Internet Protocol.  */
#define PF_APPLETALK    5       /* Don't use this.  */
and in /etc/conf.modules
alias net-pf-3 off
alias net-pf-4 off
alias net-pf-5 appletalk
