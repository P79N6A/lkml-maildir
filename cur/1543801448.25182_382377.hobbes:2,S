<smhuch> - the sound of my eyeballs popping out and splatting against

So ... recompilation is not testable, but boot time reordering of the 
code somehow is? ;-) Yes, I understand the distro toolchain issues, but 
it's still a scary solution ...
Personally, I'd think the sane thing is not to try to optimise by 
workload, but get 80% of the benefit by just reordering on a more 
generalized workload. Doing boot-time reordering for this on non-custom 
kernels just seems terrifying .. it's not that huge a benefit, surely?

I was thinking about that with modules earlier, and whether modular 
kernels would actually be faster because of that than a statically 
compiled one. But don't you get similar effects from the .o groupings by 
file we get? or does the linker not preserve those groupings?
