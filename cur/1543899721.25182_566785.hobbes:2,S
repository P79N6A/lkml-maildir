I have mentioned this problem before with resizing non-partitioned devices,
then trying to resize the filesystem.  
I consider the issue a bug, because different parts of the kernel have
a different size for the same device.  It should be consistent, preferably
with the new size being reported both by the sys fs and by blockdev (then
hopefully xfs_growfs will work without a reboot).
