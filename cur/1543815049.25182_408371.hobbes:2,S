Thanks, it helps a lot :)

In fact that is not enough.
In include/asm-i386/timex.h, get_cycles() is defined as
        static inline cycles_t get_cycles (void)
        {
                unsigned long long ret=0;
        
        #ifndef CONFIG_X86_TSC
                if (!cpu_has_tsc)
                        return 0;
        #endif
        
        #if defined(CONFIG_X86_GENERIC) || defined(CONFIG_X86_TSC)
                rdtscll(ret);
        #endif
                return ret;
        }
If one (as I did at the first attempt) selects a CPU type of
"586/K5/5x86/6x86/6x86MX", he will get nothing from /proc/latency_trace.
So does it make sense to add dependency lines like the following one?
        depends on (!X86_32 || X86_GENERIC || X86_TSC)
Cheers,
Wu
