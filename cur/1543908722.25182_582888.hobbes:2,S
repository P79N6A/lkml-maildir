Since there's no atomic "unlock and read" function, any code that could ever
close a socket in one thread while another thread is blocked on read might
call close just before another thread blocks in read. Nothing stops another
thread from opening something, getting the same file descriptor, and then
allowing the thread to call "read" on the wrong file descriptor entirely.
Since this can never be made sane in general, I see little point in making
one variation of what can go wrong a bit saner. It is still irresponsible to
code like this.
