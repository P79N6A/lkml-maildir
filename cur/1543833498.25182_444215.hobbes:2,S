there's a git tree which contains the sanitised exported headers for all
architectures -- basically the result of 'make headers_install'.
It tracks Linus' kernel tree, by means of some evil scripts.¹
Only commits in Linus' tree which actually affect the exported result
should have an equivalent commit in the above tree, which means that any
changes which affect userspace should be clearly visible for review.
