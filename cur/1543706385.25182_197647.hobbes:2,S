sysfs, definitely.

You have control of what happens to the devices.  If you don't want them 
probed for partitions, they won't be..

This would be something to talk with the md maintainer about, I think. 
I'm not sure we want to do this, since the user may have a valid reason 
to access the underlying disk.
