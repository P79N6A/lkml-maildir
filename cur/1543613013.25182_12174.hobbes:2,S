Shouldn't of said direct mapped there, they actually are direct mapped. 
I meant the function from virtual memory to cache isn't one-to-one, i.e.
multiple virtual addresses map to similar cache lines.
I should of added that n-way set associativity is increasingly making
this all less needed, but its still has benefits (the downside is there
is overhead, obviously, to making sure everything maps appropriately).
