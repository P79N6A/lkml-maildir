Subject: functions from 2.0 replaced by?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

These 3 functions existed on a 2.0.36 / glibc2.0.6 box:
verify_area (from mm.h)
memcpy_tofs (from ??)
memcpy_fromfs (from ??)
They however do not exist on my 2.2.7 / glibc2.1.1pre2 box.
Have they been replaced?  If so, by what?  Are they deprecated?  If so, what 
should I replace them with?
Thanks in advance, once again.
