GPL and BSD are two different philosophies of freedom.
Some people (e.g. me) consider the BSD licence a less free licence 
since it doesn't defend that the code stays free.
Some people consider the BSD licence more free since NetApp or Linux or 
Microsoft can take your code and never gove back.
Although I don't agree with it, I can understand the rationale of the 
latter.
But stating in your licence that noone has to give back but then 
complaining to some people on ethical grounds that they should give
back is simply dishonest.
Is your intention to allow people to include your code into GPL'ed code 
and never give back, or is your intention that this shouldn't happen?
And whatever your intention is should be stated in your licence.
