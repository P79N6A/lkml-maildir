Basically from what I read:
1. The MCH/ICH8 hub 'requires' a minimum of 512MB to run, the board manual 
states it needs at least 512MB of memort.
2. The DVT/IGP graphics uses either 128MB or 256MB, I have it set to 
128MB.
How can the Linux kernel find this out/poll this information so users do 
not have to know mem=XXXXM?
Justin.
