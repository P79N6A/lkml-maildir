Again Evgeniy I really begin to like kevent :)

I wonder if you can reorder fields in this structure, so that 'read mostly' 
fields are grouped together, maybe in a different cache line.
This should help reduce false sharing in SMP.
read mostly fields are (but you know better than me) : callbacks, rcu_head, 
priv, user, event, ...
+#define KEVENT_MAX_EVENTS      4096
Could you please tell me (Forgive me if you already clarified this point) , 
what happens if the number of queued events reaches this value ?
+int kevent_init(struct kevent *k)
+{
+       spin_lock_init(&k->ulock);
+       k->flags = 0;
+
+       if (unlikely(k->event.type >= KEVENT_MAX))
+               return kevent_break(k);

As long you are sure we cannot call kevent_enqueue()/kevent_dequeue() after a 
failed kevent_init() it should be fine.
+int kevent_add_callbacks(const struct kevent_callbacks *cb, int pos)
+{
+       struct kevent_callbacks *p;
+       
+       if (pos >= KEVENT_MAX)
+               return -EINVAL;
if a negative pos is used here we might crash. KEVENT_MAX is a signed too, so 
the compare is done on signed values.
If we consider callers always give a sane value, the test can be suppressed.
If we consider callers may be wrong, then we must do a correct test.
If you dont want to change function prototype, then change the test to :
if ((unsigned)pos >= KEVENT_MAX)
              return -EINVAL;
Some people on lkml will prefer:
if (pos < 0 || pos >= KEVENT_MAX)
	return -EINVAL;
or
#define KEVENT_MAX 6U /* unsigned constant */
+static kmem_cache_t *kevent_cache;
You probably want to add __read_mostly here to avoid false sharing.
+static kmem_cache_t *kevent_cache __read_mostly;
Same for other caches :
+static kmem_cache_t *kevent_poll_container_cache;
+static kmem_cache_t *kevent_poll_priv_cache;
About the hash table :
+struct kevent_user
+{
+       struct list_head        kevent_list[KEVENT_HASH_MASK+1];
+       spinlock_t              kevent_lock;
epoll used to use a hash table too (its size was configurable at init time), 
and was converted to a RB-tree for good reasons...(avoid a user to allocate a 
big hash table in pinned memory and DOS)
Are you sure a process handling one million sockets will succeed using kevent 
instead of epoll ?
Do you have a pointer to sample source code using mmap()/kevent interface ? 
It's not clear to me how we can use it (and notice that a full wrap occured, 
user app could miss x*KEVENT_MAX_EVENTS events ?). Do we still must use a 
syscall to dequeue events ?
In particular you state sizeof(mukevent) is 40, while its 12:
+/*
+ * Note that kevents does not exactly fill the page (each mukevent is 40 
bytes),
+ * so we reuse 4 bytes at the begining of the first page to store index.
+ * Take that into account if you want to change size of struct ukevent.
+ */
+struct mukevent
+{
+       struct kevent_id        id;  /* size()=8 */
+       __u32                   ret_flags; /* size()=4 */
+};
Thank you
Eric
