"Yet"? I haven't been following things closely enough, but I got the
impression that the long-term plan was something like this:
1. Move all the IDE drivers over to libata (Alan Cox has a patch to do
this, at least part of that patch is in -mm, and I'm already running
this flawlessly on one of my systems -- it's not debugged yet, but
none of the bugs happen to hit me). Yes, this means *all* ATA hard
drives become /dev/sd*, not just SATA.
2. Reorganize the Kconfig menus so that ATA stuff is no longer a
subsection of SCSI.
3. Rename /dev/sd* to /dev/disk*.
Of course, I could be mistaken (in which case, please feel free to correct me).
