Yes, that's a killer: ordered tags aren't going to be able to enforce cross 
device write barriers.
There is one remaining curiosity I have, at least about the benchmarks: Since 
the linux elevator and tag queueing perform essentially similar function 
(except that the disk itself has a better notion of ordering because it knows 
its own geometry).  Might we get better performance by reducing the number of 
tags we allow the device to use, thus forcing the writes to remain longer in 
the linux elevator?
