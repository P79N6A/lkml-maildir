Which display driver are you using for X? Using Xinerama/multi-displays or similar?
I noticed this behaviour once on a dual-monitor setup. After starting X then 
exiting it, I noticed the problems that you describe on the primary monitor. 
However the secondary monitor was showing the output as normal (including 
cursor) if I remember correctly.
Both displays were running from a single GeForce4 Ti card, using the nvidia 
binary driver under X. No framebuffer.
Never found the problem, but never really investigated either.
