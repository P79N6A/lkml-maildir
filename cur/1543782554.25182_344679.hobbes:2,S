Subject: [PATCH 0/7] Cell SPU file system, snapshot 4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Thankfully, there is now documentation available to the world about
the Cell architecture (
http://cell.scei.co.jp/e_download.html
), so I
am now able to disclose more of our work on the SPU file system.
This is a rather big update compared to the previous version, as it
contains work from Mark Nutter and Ulrich Weigand to support context
save and restore of SPUs. This release should still be fully compatible
to the previous ones, but we intend to do incompatible changes for
in the future.
