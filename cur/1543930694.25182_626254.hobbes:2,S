On x86_32, a diff between defconfig before and after the patchset :

< CONFIG_INSTRUMENTATION=y
< CONFIG_PROFILING=y
< CONFIG_OPROFILE=y
< CONFIG_KPROBES=y
< # CONFIG_MARKERS is not set
Shows the same result. As you explain in your message, the HAVE_* is
just a way to know if the architecture provides a feature. The menu
entry is CONFIG_<FOO>, which depends on CONFIG_HAVE_<FOO>, will allow
y/n/m selection.
