The hardware sector size?  It depends on the drive.  
Some may let you do it, this usually requires a low-level
format, possibly using litte-documented vendor specific tricks.

Having two scripts, one for each case is too bad?

You should really ask the manufacturer.  One reason may be to squeeze
more data onto the disk.  Each sector has some overhead on the magnetic 
surface, such as crc data and sector gaps.  And the sector number is 
written too so the disk firmware knows where the head is - this is why
you need a low-level format when changing.  You need to write
new sector numbers for the different-sized sectors.
The overhead means you get more data on the disk by using larger
sectors.  Fewer sectors in total means less overhead when per-sector
overhead adds upp.
