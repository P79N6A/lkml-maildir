There is.
For kernel.org, you could say '/pub/scm/blah' in your alternates
and expect it to work, only because 
http://kernel.org/pub
hierarchy happens to match the absolute path /pub on the
filesystem, but for most people's default HTTP server
installation, they would need to say /var/www/scm/blah to have
alternate work locally, but somebody has to know that the named
directory is served as 
http://machine.xz/pub/scm/blah
 somewhere.
Client side smarts need some help from the user here to know
that '/var/www/scm/blah' read off of objects/info/alternates
match that URL.
