The kernel is providing the mechanism to interleave over a set of nodes or 
prefer a single node for allocations, but it also provides for remapping 
those to different nodes, without regard to locality or affinity to 
specific hardware, when the cpuset changes.  That's what Choice C is 
intended to replace: a node means a node so either you get an effected 
mempolicy over the nodemask you asked for, or MPOL_DEFAULT is used because 
you lack sufficient access.
