There is no such asymmetry, at least not in theory.
POSIX.2 states that mv will move directories as well as files,
also across filesystems.
From mv(1):
DESCRIPTION
       mv moves or renames files or directories.
...
       When  both source and destination are on the same filesys­
       tem, they are the same file (just  the  name  is  changed;
       owner,  mode, timestamps remain unchanged).  When they are
       on different filesystems, the source file  is  copied  and
       then  deleted.   mv  will  copy  modification time, access
       time, user and group ID, and mode if possible. When  copy­
       ing user and/or group ID fails, the setuid and setgid bits
       are cleared in the copy.
GNU DETAILS
       The GNU implementation (in fileutils-3.16)  is  broken  in
       the  sense  that  mv  can  move  only regular files across
       filesystems.

but as mentioned this is incorrect. A POSIX compliant mv(1)
will move directories, but GNU fileutils 3.16 is not POSIX
compliant. Apparently GNU fileutils 4.0 corrects this - I have
not yet seen it. Updates for the man pages are welcome.
