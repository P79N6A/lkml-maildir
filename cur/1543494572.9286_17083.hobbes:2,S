Hi!
Shaw Carruthers (shaw@shawc.demon.co.uk),
"sym/ncr53c8xx phase error still present in 2.2.7":

I see similar problems with an NCR810A and an IBM DDRS 4.3G. I've removed
anything else from the bus, replaced all cables, switched to known good
terminators, disabled sync tarbsfer, queueing, disconnect. No luck. I tried
2.0.35, 2.2.[67] - if available with the sym83c8xx driver, too.
Replacing either disk (with an elderly 1G Seagate) or controller (with an
Adaptec 2940) solves the problem.
I tried to reproduce this with FreeBSD 2.2.6 and 3.0 - Problem disapeared.
It ran my stress test for 5 hours. Linux ran only between 5 minutes up to 2
hours stable.
Somehow I don't think it's hardware-related.
Rainer
