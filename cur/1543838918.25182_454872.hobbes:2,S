I think hal should get an error when it tries to open the cdrom device
when the burning application is using it.  It shouldn't even get a
chance to issue an ioctl.  I was assuming hal doesn't keep the cdrom
device open at all times (if it does, well that would be stupid).

Hmm, so how does one tell hal to go to hell and leave the cdrom device
alone at all times (other than totally disabling hal).  Who the heck
wants all that stupid auto crap anyhow. :)
