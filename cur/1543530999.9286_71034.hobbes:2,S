I just put util-linux-2.10h the usual places
(such as ftp.win.tue.nl:/pub/linux-local/utils/util-linux).
There are many changes, but for l-k people the following may be of interest:
* Added pivot_root (Werner Almesberger)
* Added elvtune (Andrea Arcangeli)
* Added need and extended simpleinit and shutdown (Richard Gooch)
