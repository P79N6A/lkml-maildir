Hello,
I got under kernel 2.2.9 (redhat 5.2) the following errors I have
never seen before:
(...)

Is this something I should worry about?
I found some people reporting similar messages, thinking they
have something to do with the sym/ncr53c875-scsi-driver resp.
with broken scsi disks. It is true that I have a scsi controller,
but only for my tape drive; all of my disks are ide ones and 
according to e2fsck and scandisk I don't recognize any damage
to my disks. Maybe some of these people are interested in the 
fact, that in my case it doesn't seem to be a disk problem.
But - can I do anything to avoid those error messages?
Many thanks,
Juergen.
