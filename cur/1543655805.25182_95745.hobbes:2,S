Clearly the truth is somewhere between your two viewpoints, but one thing is
for sure:  The Linux kernel is hands down the better product.  There are
still a few exceptions to this rule, but those are disappearing rapidly
(epoll cures the last one that gives me heartburn).
Now, if only the application designers could match what Windows applications
designers have accomplished.  I think the first step would to torpedo
X-Windows :) ...But that's a topic for some other mailing list.
