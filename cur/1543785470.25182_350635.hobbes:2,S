I like the look of the patch.
I would like to go one step further and simply disallow writing to
MAP_SHARED memory full stop. It eliminates so many corner cases and
weird behaviour (ie. after writing to a readonly MAP_SHARED, the process
will no longer see updates to the file).
Actually, maybe that's too much. I imagine on a shared memory
application
there would be use in changing writeable MAP_SHARED memory in a
debugger.
How about we disallow writing to readonly MAP_SHARED?
However going back a step - I still think Andrea's patch is nicer than
what we have now.
