Igor didn't rant, not even a little bit, and it reflects poorly on you
that you engage in hyperbole rather than hear his story.  In fact, or at
least in my opinion as a computer programmer with 30 years experience,
he's right: A newly stable kernel is not stable.  He might even be right
about regressions since 2.6.24.
It's a sorry day when somebody making a simple, reasonable and accurate
feedback is criticised for not providing bug reports.  But don't let him
(or me) stop you guys from toasting your fine success.  You believe it's
stable; what more could anyone want?
