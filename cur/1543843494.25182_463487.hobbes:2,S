I have a C program that computes limits to obtain desired guarantees
in a single 'for (i = 0; i < n; n++)' loop for any given set of guarantees.
With all error handling, beautifull output, nice formatting etc it weights
only 60 lines.

I do not 'do not like guarantee'. I'm just sure that there are two ways
for providing guarantee (for unreclaimable resorces):
1. reserving resource for group in advance
2. limit resource for others
Reserving is worse as it is essentially limiting (you cut off 100Mb from
1Gb RAM thus limiting the other groups by 900Mb RAM), but this limiting
is too strict - you _have_ to reserve less than RAM size. Limiting in
run-time is more flexible (you may create an overcommited BC if you
want to) and leads to the same result - guarantee.
