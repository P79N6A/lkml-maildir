Conincidentally I've found the same problem but fixed it differently.
Because nr_real is not real # of devices but max # of devices of a major #,
it doesn't need to be changed on disk add/remove.

< 		sd_gendisks[i].nr_real = 0;
---
> 		sd_gendisks[i].nr_real = SCSI_DISKS_PER_MAJOR;
1336d1335
< 	SD_GENDISK(i).nr_real++;
1450d1448
< 			SD_GENDISK(i).nr_real--;
2.6 has little different structure but it does like this
sd.c:sd_probe()
	gd->minors = 16;
