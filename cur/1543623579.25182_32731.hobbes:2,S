   use vmalloc_32(), this one returns lowmem.
You can't use vmalloc() pointers as arguments to pci_map_single.
That is the point of what he's mentioning.

   This is illegal because addr is a kernel _virtual_ address.  You have to
   get the page using vmalloc_to_page() and feed this to pci_map_page()
   then. 
There is no such requirement that pci_map_page() only be used.
If you know you haven't got a HIGHMEM page, it is legal to
pass this to pci_map_single().
