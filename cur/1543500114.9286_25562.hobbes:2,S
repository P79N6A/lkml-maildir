	I have three ide disks and an ide cd (see below).  The problem is that the 
	newest disk (hdb in this case) isn't configured so I can see all of it.  The
	disk is a 13Gb disk, but I can only get to about 8Gb as seen in the df 
	output below.  Note the differences in the RawCHS values between the two
	hdparm outputs.
	My questions are:
	1)what do I need to do the see the whole disk?  
	hdb: Maxtor 91303D6, 12427MB w/512kB Cache, CHS=25249/16/63, (U)DMA
Very good! So the kernel does see the entire disk.
You just failed to partition it correctly.
	[root@helium /root]# hdparm -i /dev/hdb  (info obtained at boot time)
	 CurCHS=25249/16/63, CurSects=25450992, LBA=yes, LBAsects=25450992
The hdparm -i info is broken - it is not the info obtained at boot time,
but a mangled version of that.
	[root@helium /root]# hdparm -I /dev/hdb  (info requested from the drive)
	 CurCHS=16383/16/63, CurSects=16514064, LBA=yes, LBAsects=25450992
This is as expected. The disk must report 16383/16/63, independent
of its actual size, when it is at least 8.4 GB, according to ATA specs.
The size is found by looking at LBAsects.
