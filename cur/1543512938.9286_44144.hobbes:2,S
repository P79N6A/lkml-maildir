Greetings,
Setting aside the likely "2.0 is obsolete" / "the performance won't be as
good" answers for a moment, is there any functional reason not to run a
2.0.3X kernel on a PIII?  We're testing some proprietary code which runs
under Linux 2.0 and has not yet been ported to 2.2, and we'd like to test
it on a PIII.  I am aware that there are probably lots of CPU
optimizations/features which will not be supported, but the main thing I'm
concerned about is functionality: things like untrapped CPU-specific bugs,
device-driver imcompatibilities, etc.
thanks,
-bp
