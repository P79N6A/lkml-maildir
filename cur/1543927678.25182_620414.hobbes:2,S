Hi, Eric:
Thank you for the quick response. You can get the source code containing 
the test code from 
ftp://ftp.jlab.org/pub/hpc/qmt.tar.gz
 . This is a 
data parallel threading package for physics calculation. The test code 
is pthread_sync in the src directory once you unpack the gz file. To 
configure and build this package is very simple: configure and make. The 
  test program is built by make check. The number of threads is 
controlled by QMT_NUM_THREADS. The package is using pthread spin lock, 
but the barrier is implemented using a queue-based barrier algorithm 
proposed by  J. B. Carter of University of Utah (2005).

I am not sure what the biggest change between kernel 2.6.21 and 2.6.22 
(23) is? Is the scheduler the biggest change between these versions? Can 
the scheduler of kernel somehow effect the performance? I know the 
scheduler is trying to do load balance and so on. Can the scheduler move 
threads to different cores according to the load balance algorithm even 
though the threads are bound to cores using pthread_setaffinity_np call 
when the number of threads is fewer than the number of cores? I am 
thinking about this because the performance of our test code is roughly 
the same for both kernels when the number of threads equals to the 
number of cores.
