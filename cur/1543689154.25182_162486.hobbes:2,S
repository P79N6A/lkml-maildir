> Latency is not bandwidth.
Bingo.
The way to address memory latency is by increasing bandwidth and
increasing parallelism to use it -- thus amortizing the latency.  HT is
one of many ways to do this.  If systems are to grow faster at a rate
better than memory speeds, then plan on more parallelism, not less.
