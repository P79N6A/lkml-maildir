Then people are getting what they deserve. Any time you employ some
external source for filtering your email, you'd better take the time to
figure out how to use it correctly. This applies to any of the current
RBL-style blacklists.

Your description is accurate, except that you'll still have problems
communicating, if you're the "Linux Wizard". The MAPS DUL is a listing of
dynamic dialup pools based on information gleaned from various providers
and research, and blacklists people in the situation you described.

No, not being aware of some of the limitations of running a mail server
from a dialup link has damaged your communication.

You administrate a lot of SMTP servers on non-static links?

You're not giving your SMTP servers static addresses? I find this either
hard to believe, or unquestionably silly.

You're right, the blame is being mislaid.
It should be on that 1% of the population which is ruining it for the
others, not on the ISP or ORBS.

Actually, I've thought about it a long time, and have been using and
defending ORBS almost since it's inception. I've had to email Alan several
times due to confusion over what people were stating about ORBS and what
ORBS actually did, to ensure that I had correct and complete information.
Believe me, with the arguments that ensue regarding it (it seems like
people are having this conversation on damn near every mailing list I'm on
now), I've thought about it.
Have you?
