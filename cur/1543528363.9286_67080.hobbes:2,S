Hi,
So I saw the latest kernel moves paging_init before reading the MP tables.  
My question is this... on our systems, the MP tables will be in the BIOS 
protected area (ie the area that the e820 call will report as unusable).  
Will the de-reference of such an address still work once paging_init has 
been called? Also, is this intended to work because paging_init installs 
translations for all available RAM?
Best Wishes,
Lyle
