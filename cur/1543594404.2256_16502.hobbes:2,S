Hi all,
	
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lhcs/
	Version 0.3 (untested) of the HotPlug CPU Patch is out, with
ia64 and x86 support.  Bringing CPUs down and up is as simple as:
	# Down...
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/cpu/1
	# Up...
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/cpu/1
	Apologies for the slow release, and *huge* kudos to the people
who did the real work for this release:
	Kimio Suganuma (ia64)
	Jason McMullan (x86)
Thanks!
Rusty.
