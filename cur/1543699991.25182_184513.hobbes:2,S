I've seen this, too, with XFS=y and OOM_KILLER=n, but haven't yet gotten
around to "make clean" and try again with a fresh build (I had 2.4.23
code traces in the .o files). I also have device-manager 1.00.07
patched in (no rejects, no manual edits necessary). My version was
pulled from BK, I can look up the latest ChangeSet I pulled from the
official kernel if necessary. I'll now try a "make clean" build after
yet another BK pull.

SuSE Linux 8.2, gcc 3.3.1, Gigabyte 7ZX-R (VIA KT133 + Promise 20265R),
root ext3 on SCSI (sym53c8xx_2), no devfs, no usb storage, vfat, xfs.
However, I doubt the file systems matter, the machine apparently hasn't
probed my partitions when it reboots.
