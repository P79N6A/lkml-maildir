So these are being proposed for 2.6.22?
I do wonder about Rafael's bug which he bisected down to
gregkh-driver-sysfs-use-singly-linked-list-for-sysfs_dirent-tree.patch.
If that won't be a problem in this patchset then I spose it's probably best
to go ahead with a 2.6.22 merge, but it's more a Greg thing than a me
thing.
I don't have a tree to merge these patches into, unless I drop all the
patches which are in Greg's tree.
Greg, can I leave it up to you to decide how we are to proceed here?
