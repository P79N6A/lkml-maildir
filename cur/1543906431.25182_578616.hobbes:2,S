Does it continue booting if you keep pressing the Ctrl key repeatedly?
I have one that does, with kernel 2.6.23-rc1-git9 -- otherwise it just
sits there indefinitely. As soon as I press a key it continues. This is
even with 'nohz=off highres=off'.
Using 'nolapic_timer' (by itself) fixes it, though.
