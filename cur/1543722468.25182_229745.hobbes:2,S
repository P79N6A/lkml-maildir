I started a thread a while ago (2.6.3/2.6.4) where I submitted some
patches to UTF-8ifying the kernel sources.  Basically, most of the
kernel is ASCII (98.4% of the files).  The rest are mostly ISO-Latin-1,
with the rare bit of Japanese (in a couple of charsets) and some just
random bytes in some of the Documentation/...

It's sorta difficult to do non-ASCII patches over email because
the kernel developers like reading their mail in mutt, and don't 
like attachments (the only sane ways to send non 7-bit clean data:
8-bit MIME: tagged and bagged or uuencoded)
Further, you confuse the hell out of vi if you have any trash (8bit data
in another charset) in a file that's supposed to be UTF-8.  i.e. don't
think you're going to be able to look at a charset changing patch in
anything.
