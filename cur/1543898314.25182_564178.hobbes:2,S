Again:
It's not intended for normal kernels. It's a debugging feature.

Got it now? Power wasting or not just doesn't matter for it.

Yes, there seem to be more buggy keyboard controllers
around than I anticipated. Very sad that IBM couldn't even
get such a simple thing right.
Well only those that could be already hung from user space
with setleds (that was also confirmed).  Actually I thought
they didn't hang completely, but just stopped reacting to 
the keyboard (which is actually pretty bad for every user
to be able to trigger)
I guess the better way to handle those would be to find out the 
minimum frequency of blinking that is still ok and rate limit it to that in 
the keyboard driver. 
Anyways, Stephen's patch just doesn't make sense: 
he clearly didn't understand the code at all. Before you
apply it and cripple it better drop the driver completely.
