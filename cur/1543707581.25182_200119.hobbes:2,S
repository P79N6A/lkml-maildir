Hello all,
Due to traffic restraints, I am not on the lkml - please CC replies.
Yesterday I built 2.6.3.  Clean build, and system runs nice.
I have two NIC's in the box, both rt8139.
But I noticed I am getting this in syslogs:
Linux233 kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out
Linux233 kernel: eth1: link up, 10Mbps, half-duplex, lpa 0x0000
Linux233 kernel: nfs: server 486Linux not responding, still trying
Linux233 kernel: nfs: server 486Linux not responding, still trying
Linux233 kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
Linux233 kernel: nfs: server 486Linux OK
Linux233 kernel: nfs: server 486Linux OK
Linux233 kernel: nfs: server 486Linux not responding, still trying
Linux233 kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
Linux233 kernel: nfs: server 486Linux OK
This happens about once every 3 hours.
From my config file:
# CONFIG_8139CP is not set
CONFIG_8139TOO=y
# CONFIG_8139TOO_PIO is not set
# CONFIG_8139TOO_TUNE_TWISTER is not set
# CONFIG_8139TOO_8129 is not set
# CONFIG_8139_OLD_RX_RESET is not set
# CONFIG_8139_RXBUF_IDX= is not set
No other NIC drivers are used.
I am also stuck as to what the new RXBUF_IDX is for.  It appears the 
new build needs it, as I cannot remove.
These cards have worked fine under all 2.4.x and 2.6.1/2.6.2 kernels.
Ideas?
TIA,
Nick
