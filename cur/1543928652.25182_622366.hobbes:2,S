page_private() at this point stores a swp_entry_t.  There are swp_type()
and swp_offset() helpers to decode the two bits you need after you've
turned page_private() into a swp_entry_t.  See how get_swap_bio()
creates a temporary swp_entry_t from the page_private() passed into it,
then uses swp_type/offset() on it?
I don't know if there is some history behind it, but it doesn't make a
whole ton of sense to me to be passing page_private(page) into
get_swap_bio() (which happens from its only two call sites).  It just
kinda obfuscates where 'index' came from.
It think we probably could just be doing
	swp_entry_t entry = { .val = page_private(page), };
in get_swap_bio() and not passing page_private().  We have the page in
there already, so we don't need to pass a derived value like
page_private().  At the least, it'll save some clutter in the function
declaration.  
Or, make a helper:
static swp_entry_t page_swp_entry(struct page *page)
{
	swp_entry_t entry;
	VM_BUG_ON(!PageSwapCache(page));
	entry.val = page_private(page);
	return entry;
}
I see at least 4 call sites that could use this.  The try_to_unmap_one()
caller would trip over the debug check, so you'd have to move the call
inside of the if(PageSwapCache(page)) statement.
