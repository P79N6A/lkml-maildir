Then you are tuning a file-system for a single program
like `ls`. Most real-world I/O to file-systems are not done
by `ls` or even `make`. The extra read-ahead overhead is
just that, 'overhead'. Since the cost of disk I/O is expensive,
you certainly do not want to read any more than is absolutely
necessary. There had been a lot so studies about this in the
70's when disks were very, very, slow. The disk-to-RAM speed
ratio hasn't changed much even though both are much faster.
Therefore, the conclusions of these studies, made by persons
from DEC and IBM, should not have changed. From what I recall,
all studies showed that read-ahead always reduced performance,
but keeping what was already read in RAM always increased
performance.
