I turned off cardmgr for 2.6, CardBus works without it on slackware 
'cos pciutils is patched to provide a helper, what is 'correct' way 
to test this?  
Toshiba laptop with ToPIC100 bridge, currently not working for 
PCCard 16-bit things because I turned off cardmgr.  CardBus NIC 
works in 2.4 + 2.6 series.
