This was not a working patch, just to throw the idea, since the answers I got showed I was not understood.
In this case, find_extend_vma() should of course have one struct vm_area_cache * argument, like find_vma()
One single cache on one mm is not scalable. oprofile badly hits it on a dual cpu config.
