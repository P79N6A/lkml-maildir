ok so for the non-null case you have
test-nbranch-call-test-nbranch
vs
call-test-nbranch
vs the null case where you get
test-branch
vs
call-test-branch
(I'm using nbranch here as a non-taken branch; it's also a conditional
branch and it has the same misprediction possibility)
in the non-null case with if you have *two* chances for the branch
predictor to go wrong. (and "wrong" can also mean "cold, eg unknown"
here) and always an extra "test-nbranch" sequence, which is probably a
cycle at least
the offset for that is the null-case-without-if where you have an extra
"call", which is also half to a whole cycle.
even in the null case it's dubious if there is gain, it depends on how
the branch predictor happens to feel that day ;)
