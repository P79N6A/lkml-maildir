Hi,
     Looks like cli is done two times in arch/i386/boot/compressed/head.S.
The first occurence is in line number 33 just 2 lines after startup_32.
The second one is at line 103, just after the move_routine is moved to 
its rightful place and before transferring control to it. This looks 
like a redundant cli. The only place EFLAGS is directly touched is in 
line 53 (popfl) but that still has no effect on interrupt flag.
Please correct me if I am wrong, else the second cli may be removed.
Regards,
-Romit
