hi,
our department recently bought an alpha machine with linux on.
however, they are sending it back because some of the comercial
software is not supported.
the idea now is to get a dual processor pentium.
my question is this - how well supported is this under linux?
is it stable? and also does the kernel make any effort to 
parallelize across both processors or does it just multi-task across
them?
thanks for any info.
keith.
