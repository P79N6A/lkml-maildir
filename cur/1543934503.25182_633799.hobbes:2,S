i think SLOB/embedded is sufficiently special that a "no /proc/slabinfo" 
restriction is perfectly supportable. (for instance it's only selectable 
if CONFIG_EMBEDDED=y) If a SLOB user has any memory allocation problems 
it's worth going to the bigger allocators anyway, to get all the 
debugging goodies.
btw., do you think it would be worth/possible to have build mode for 
SLUB that is acceptably close to the memory efficiency of SLOB? (and 
hence work towards unifying all the 3 allocators into SLUB in essence)
right now we are far away from it - SLUB has an order of magnitude 
larger .o than SLOB, even on UP. I'm wondering why that is so - SLUB's 
data structures _are_ quite compact and could in theory be used in a 
SLOB-alike way. Perhaps one problem is that much of SLUB's debugging 
code is always built in?
