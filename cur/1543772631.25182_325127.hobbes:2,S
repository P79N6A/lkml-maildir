I see this problem too with i430TX chipset (the south bridge and thus 
IDE controller is the same as in i440LX/EX and BX/ZX).
2.6.12-rc5:
/dev/hda:
  Timing cached reads:   180 MB in  2.02 seconds =  89.11 MB/sec
  Timing buffered disk reads:   40 MB in  3.09 seconds =  12.94 MB/sec
2.4.31:
/dev/hda:
  Timing cached reads:   180 MB in  2.03 seconds =  88.67 MB/sec
  Timing buffered disk reads:   62 MB in  3.01 seconds =  20.60 MB/sec
I also noticed that during the buffered read test on 2.6 kernel, the IDE 
activity LED is blinking (so the drive is not 100% utilised) while it's 
permanently on with 2.4.
