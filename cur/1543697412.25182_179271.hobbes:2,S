OK, I booted up mm3 based kernel and these errors do NOT appear. I 
remember having had this problem once before but somehow got rid of this 
by several recompilings of the kernel... Nevertheless it is a strange thing.
The other error on reboot also appears with mm3, but ONLY on reboot, but 
not on halt, IIRC. It appears on unmounting and before remounting as 
readonly. Something like atomic_dec_blah in atomic.h connected with ntfs.
