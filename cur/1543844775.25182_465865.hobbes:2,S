I'd not heard of this phenomenon, and it worries me.  There are places
in kernel code where we peek at some volatile variable (perhaps a long)
without locking, and expect to see it in any one of several well-defined
states.  Are you saying that there are architectures supported by Linux,
on which we might see an "impossible" mix of states, due to score-boarding?
