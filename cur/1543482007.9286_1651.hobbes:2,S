Just about GGI (www.ggi-project.org):
"GGI stands for "General Graphics Interface", and it is a project that aims
to develop a reliable, stable and fast graphics system
that works everywhere. We want to allow any program using GGI to run on any
platform requiring at most a recompile. 
It all started out with some people being annoyed by the fact that graphics
in Linux means either X or svgalib, and if you use
both at the same time, you can easily crash the graphics card and make the
system unusable. Nowadays, GGI development also
involves a portable userspace library, 3D graphics, and anything else that
is fun to hack :-) "
