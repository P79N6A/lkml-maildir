No (but maybe I phrased it badly):
    % cat Makefile 
    foo: bar
            echo did it
    % touch foo bar
    % ls --full-time foo bar
    -rw-r--r--    1 pimlott  pimlott         0 Sun Oct 27 09:36:26 2002 bar
    -rw-r--r--    1 pimlott  pimlott         0 Sun Oct 27 09:36:26 2002 foo
    % make
    make: `foo' is up to date.
Ie, foo is considered newer.

I'm sure there is a case where this is true, but my imagination and
googling failed to provide one.  Even the messages to the GNU make
mailing list when Paul Eggert implemented nanosecond support didn't
include a specific rationale.

While I agree, I thought that a concrete example might help persuade
others.  (I think I've even run into instances where second
resolution was a real problem, I just can't recall them.)

Example problem case (assuming a fs that stores only seconds, and a
make that uses nanoseconds):
- I run the "save and build" command while editing foo.c at T = 0.1.
- foo.o is built at T = 0.2.
- I do some read-only operations on foo.c (eg, checkin), such that
  foo.o gets flushed but foo.c stays in memory.
- I build again.  foo.o is reloaded and has timestamp T = 0, and so
  gets spuriously rebuilt.

Only if the flush is less than a second after the write, right?
How likely is that in Linux?
I tend to prefer the proposal to set the nanosecond field to 10^9-1.
At least my scenario above doesn't happen.
