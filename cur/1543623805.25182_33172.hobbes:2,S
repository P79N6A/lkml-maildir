Subject: [ANNOUNCE] ltp-20020307 Released
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The Linux Test project ltp-20020307 has been released. For more information
about the Linux Test Project, or to download the testsuite, see our website
at 
http://ltp.sourceforge.net
.  This release includes enhancements to the
test driver, pan, that allow for more control over testing duration.
Additional tests have been added that cover disk I/O, semaphores, signals,
Streamed Controlled Transmission Protocol (SCTP), and tools for the
scheduler.  Numerous posted bugs were also addressed and closed in this
release, as well.
      We have added a new mailing list for the purpose of publishing and
requesting test results ( ltp-results@lists.sourceforge.net ).  This list
was created to act as a convenient way of keeping a central, archived
place, where anyone can publish the results of tests being run on Linux.
This list may also serve as a place for developers to request others to
test their patches, then reply to the list with results.  We encourage
everyone in the Linux Community to start actively testing Linux and
publishing the results of those tests.  In addition to this list, we've
also added a page of expected LTP failures to the website (
http://ltp.sourceforge.net/expected-errors.php
 ), and a link to a
whitepaper that details enterprise level testing in Linux (
http://www6.software.ibm.com/devcon/entteswp/EnterpriseWhitePaperv.07.html
).
