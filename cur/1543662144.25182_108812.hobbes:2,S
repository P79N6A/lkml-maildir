Thanks for your reply. I guess there are still some drives like this
floating around. I can live without it, but it is good to use it in an old
486 as a jukebox and print server :)
Your patch makes much more sense that mine (I have no experience in Linux
driver development), and it makes the drive work *very well* (excellent
transfer rate and no system overload), but only if I remove the last hunk.
This last hunk tries to read again the data with 4 sectors less each time
(i.e. 16,14,12,...,4) which *i think* overloads the buffer leading to an
oops (and even a system reboot without warning!).
Hope this information helps.
