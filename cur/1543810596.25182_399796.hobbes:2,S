Well spotted.
That was a choice that gave me pause between making it and sending the
patch.  But in the end I decided we might as well.  Repeating what I
wrote to Robin about it...
I did wonder for a while whether I'd been unhelpful to make mpol= fail
when not CONFIG_NUMA - tiresome for someone switching between NUMA and
non-NUMA kernels.  But this is an advanced option, not something for
everybody's /etc/fstab; and once I realized that all but the trivial
nodelist "0" would get rejected anyway if not CONFIG_NUMA, decided it
is best to placate the anti-bloaters with that CONFIG_NUMA after all.

I doubt the distro-makers will want to be putting "mpol=" options into
their tmpfs lines in /etc/fstab.  I hope the admins of such systems
that need it can cope.
But perhaps I should expand the mention of CONFIG_NUMA in tmpfs.txt,
to explain the issue, and suggest that "mpol=" be used in remounts
rather than automatic mounts on systems where it might be a problem.
I'll dream up some wording later.

I did briefly consider that back in the days when I noticed a host of
fs filesystems got converted.  But didn't see any point in messing
with what was already working.  Haven't looked recently: would it
actually be a useful change to make?
