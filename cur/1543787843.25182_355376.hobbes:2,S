You almost get it right, other than the layering infrastructure.
The SAS Transport Layer is a layer in its own right.  It is not
a "libsas".
MPT and open transport a very different, one hides the transport,
i.e. the transport layer is in firmware; the other exposes it
and needs a transport layer. See the pictures here:
