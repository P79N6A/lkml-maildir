OK
What's going to happen to devices at this point?

I don't think it can be _that_ simple:
(a) what about processes' memory
(b) what about areas that shouldn't be saved?

Well, I don't know why this needs to be that complicated.  We already have
code in the mainline that's able to load a large hibernation image into memory
and jump to the kernel being restored.  And it has _no_ 50% of RAM limitation,
this is the _saving_ part of the current code that this limitation comes from.
