I don't know what it is/was supposed to do. Yes, I don't know
everthing!! But, I had multiple hangups and very bad throughput
until I deleted the damn thing!
My PPP link is set up with  programs I wrote called 'connect' and
and 'callback'. They always keep the line 8-bit clean and use hardware
flow-control, not Xon/Xoff. So I don't have anything in my options
files.
