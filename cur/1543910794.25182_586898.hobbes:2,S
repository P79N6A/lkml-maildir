Why would that matter?  It either works or not.  If it doesn't
work, it can either be fixed, or support for that old compiler
version can be removed.
The only other policy than "only remove support if things are
badly broken" would be "only support what the GCC team supports",
which would be >= 4.1 now; and there are very good arguments for
supporting more than that with the Linux kernel.
