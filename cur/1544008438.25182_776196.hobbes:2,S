Aha, ok, sorry for confusion.

Hmm, 'just avoid logical journalling' seems like a better solution

ext3-like physical journaling could be extended to handle write
failures (at speed penalty), no?
Write 'I will rewrite block A containing B with C' into journal... ok,
I guess I should wait for btrfs.

Yes. fsync() seeems surprisingly high on Rusty's list of broken
interfaces classification ('impossible to use correctly').
I wonder if some reasonable solution exists? Mark filesystem as failed
on first  write error is one of those (and default for ext2/3?). Did
SGI/big unixen solve this somehow?

Yes, most applications are bad. Yes, I should just glue the card into
the slot. No, fsync interface does not look properly designed. No, it
is not causing me immediate problems (mount -o dirsync mostly works
around that). I wonder if good, long-term solution exists...
