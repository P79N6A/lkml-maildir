IMHO reducing digital outputs to LEDs goes not far enough. All System-
on-Chip CPUs have General Purpose I/O pins today, which can act as
inputs or outputs and may be used for LEDs, matrix keyboard lines, we
even use them as shutdown lines for DC/DC converters in Linux based
power controllers for autonomous measurement systems. I think a
framework for LEDs should be based upon a low level infrastrucutre for
GPIOs. I've written such a thing some time ago, it has been discussed in 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=109419621428925&w=2
Unfortunately, I didn't have time to take care of that stuff yet and
port them to recent kernels :-(
