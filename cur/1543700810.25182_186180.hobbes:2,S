Interesting. I rearranged my scancode data page a bit and added
your info - see 
http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-6.html
Are your scancodes identical to those reported by Benjamin Carter?

The overwhelming majority of all keyboards give 0xab83, translated to
0xab41, incorrectly back translated by the 2.6 kernel to 0xab02.

Yours is the second report I see for ID 0xab85.
I have no information on the details of the other keyboard.
I suppose Vojtech will have no objections to using this ID
to skip the tests for e0 and e1 as protocol (escape) scancodes.
Either everybody is happy, or we learn a bit more about unusual keyboards.
