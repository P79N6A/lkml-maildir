Hi all,
RH 5.2 rpms will be compatible with 5.1 (for the most part) and you can use
packages pre-built from that dist version.
Packages that are not included in 5.2 needed to upgrade to 2.2.x (as per the
Changes file) are available on developer.redhat.com at Red Hat Contrib|Net
or from 
http://www.affinity-systems.ab.ca/software/2.2.x-upgrades/
These include:
ipchains
modutils
net-tools
procinfo and
util-linux
The util-linux package is the only one that is signifcantly different from
the original RH version.  These should be back compatible with RH 5.1, but
were compiled under a relatively stock RH 5.2 system running 2.2.1
(therefore net-tools doesn't support ipv6 either).
Hope that helps all the people in need of an upgrade.
Jim
