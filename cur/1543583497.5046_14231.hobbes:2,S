I dont think raw network data helps. 2.2 and FreeBSD are basically the same
speed for raw networking in the general case. So if someone was seeing real
Linux/BSD differences Im concerned it might be a driver but also that it
might not have been networking differences but perhaps VM or disk I/O
performance. Clearly they saw something since its rather hard to mess up
that kind of measuring. I wonder if it was networking though.
The extreme answer to the 2.4 networking performance is the tux specweb
benchmarks but they dont answer for all cases clearly.
