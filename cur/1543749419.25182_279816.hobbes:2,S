No, in your case the extreme inode/dcache sizes indeed seem to be a problem. 
The default kernel shrinking ratio can be tuned for enhanced reclaim efficiency.

vm_vfs_scan_ratio:
------------------
is what proportion of the VFS queues we will scan in one go.
A value of 6 for vm_vfs_scan_ratio implies that 1/6th of the
unused-inode, dentry and dquot caches will be freed during a
normal aging round.
Big fileservers (NFS, SMB etc.) probably want to set this
value to 3 or 2.
The default value is 6.
=============================================================
Tune /proc/sys/vm/vm_vfs_scan_ratio increasing the value to 10 and so on and 
examine the results.
