Here are features that are present only in full kgdb:
1. Thread support  (aka info threads)
2. console messages through gdb
3. Automatic loading of modules in gdb
4. Support for x86_64
5. Support for powerpc
6. kgdb over ethernet [This isn't ready in the full version as well at this 
point of time]
