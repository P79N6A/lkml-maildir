Is there a recommended way to check to see if a slab cache with
a specific name exists before calling kmem_cache_create?
I was able to force it into the BUG() at about line 1160 of slab.c by 
removing my
module (rmmod -f) while some of my slab cache objects (e.g. private inode
info) were still in use, and then reloading my module which called
kmem_cache_create with a name that already existed.   I would
like to exit module init code with a more graceful error if I  
could easily detect that my slab cache objects were not deleted  
(since if I proceed farther in my module init code it will hit the  
BUG statement on 1160 of slab.c)
Any easy way to check?
