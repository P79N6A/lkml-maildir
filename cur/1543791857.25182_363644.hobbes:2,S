Agree, frankly i didnt like this either, but the calls there were so
nested that i tried doing multiple ways and it appeared they need
to be broken down so much to do this a little cleanly.
i did put a real ugly comment earlier, but i must have removed it in the next 
respin.
I was hoping to do just make the dirs appear/disapper (so i get the 
behaviour i need) and let people more familier with the code go fix it.

pretty-gross.... humbly saying that is :-) i will attempt to look at it 
again.
cpufreq folks... if you have better ideas brewing to make this work
in a pretty-clean way.... many thanks!
Cheers,
