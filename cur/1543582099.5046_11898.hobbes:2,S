I don't believe IBM have provided an 'official' 2.4 patch set for the serveraid
yet so there may be bugs lurking.

Yes this has also been seen. At the time you have to do this it appears that
the Linux system is not waiting for the keyboard. It only happens on specific
IBM netfinities too. Perhaps someone at IBM can trace it down a bit further
since I certainly suspect we upset the firmware.
