SLUB works, if I reboot (Alt+SysRq+B) from a 2.6.22-rc6-mm1 kernel.
Otherwise it will panic with IO-APIC + timer not working.
Differences in dmesg
2.6.22-rc6-mm1 has:
[    0.000000] Nvidia board detected. Ignoring ACPI timer override.
[    0.000000] If you got timer trouble try acpi_use_timer_override
and
[    0.000000] ACPI: BIOS IRQ0 pin2 override ignored.
and
[    0.000000] TSC calibrated against PM_TIMER
 23-rc1-mm1 has:
[    0.000000] ACPI: IRQ0 used by override.
[    0.000000] ACPI: IRQ2 used by override.
and
[   37.340319] ..MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
I did not need to use acpi_use_timer_override with the older kernel.
Do you need more info about my board/ BIOS/ ACPI tables?
After the warm-boot trick 2.6.23-rc1-mm1 seems stable right now...
