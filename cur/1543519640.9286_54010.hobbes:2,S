Hallo,
I applied the IKD patch from 
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/andrea/ikd/
 to
LinuxKernel 2.2.13 (I used the patch for 2.2.10, only three minor things
needed to be patched by hand).
Then I set a breakpoint to sys_ipc and wanted to single step trough the
code (Just for learning a little bit about the Linux internals, not
for bugtracking at the moment...). But the gdb hangs (?) (see output
below) and the testprogramm from userland gets SIGTRAP.
Did I something wrong, or did I misunderstand the xkdebug.txt
(Kernel code can be single-stepped.), or changed something in the kernel?
thank you in advance for your help
