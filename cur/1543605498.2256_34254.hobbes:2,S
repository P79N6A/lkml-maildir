Because if the tunings are hard coded, developers will be encouraged to
make sure those tunings serve at least some common case, if not most
cases.  If they are tunable, you get "the default tuning works for me. 
play with the proc settings to get it right...".
I don't agree with that.  Code it right.  If it takes a different tuning
for every case, then ditch the algorithm and let's find one that works
right.  Kind of like the point you just mentioned...
