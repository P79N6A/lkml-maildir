Just implementing this behaviour for x86 and uml is extremly
counter-productive.  Please fix up all architectures as this
behaviour needs to be the same on all ports (at least those
with a MMU)

Btw, this code is still not quite right.  We really need to call
->setattr instead of vmtruncate here.  Complex filesystem need
transaction to properly free blocks, and those transactions are in
->setattr not inside vmtruncate where ->truncate doesn't even have
a chance to get the handle to the transaction passed.
As these patches don't make it worse this is not a NACK, but more of
a heads up.

I'm not sure this is a good idea.  Concurrent syncs are a bad idea
to start with and we should just synchronyze do_sync completely.
sync_filesystems as one of the main components of do_sync already
is synchronized in that way, and taking that to a higher level would
get rid of all the worries about concurrent syncs.

Why is this in procfs?

By using lookup_one_len on an arbitrary underlying filesystem this
breaks the assumption that a nameidata is always available.  Please
redo to use proper lookup helpers.  Also whole code feels rather
fragile from a 10000 feet view, but beeing plsit in so many
patches it's almost impossible to properly review it anywya.

I'm pretty sure we already had a version better than that in your
tree on the list.  But I've lost track and we should just restart
the review cycle on -fsdevel.
> linuxpps-core-support.patch
looks generally good, but the comments should get a little loving.
Please remove the stupid filenames that always get out of sync in
the top of file comments, and make the documentation of exported
symbols kernel-doc instead of it's weird own format.
Does checkpatch.pl still not catch these things?
Also the ioctl certainly should be an unlocked_ioctl and not the
old BKL-locked variant. The !uarg checks in the ioctls can go,
copy_to/from_users does this automatically.
pps.h shoulkd be split into one header only defining the
kernel<->userspace ABI, and a kernel-internal one.  That way
also the conditional includes can go away.
> pps-documentation-programs-and-examples.patch
Once again this stuff is in and utterly wrong place where it can't
easily be package for distros.  ppsfind belongs into util-linux and
needs a proper mangage, ppsldisc is not nessecary but ldattach in
util-linux needs to grow support for N_PPS instead, and ppstest
should probably go into util-linux in a more polished version, too.
> pps-userland-header-file-for-pps-api.patch
This one is utterly wrong.  It provides what should be a userspace
library as inlines in a kernel header. 
Please do a proper libpps library package.

Hmm, must have missed this when it went to lkml.  Having this helper
generic is a good idea, but swap is far too generic for something
in kernel.h as indicated by the various renaming patches. How about
swap_vars?

No.  I might eventually take a look, but looking into btrfs has a little
higher priority right now, and split into gazillions of
non-selfcontained patches certainly doesn't help reviewing it.
BTW, the current influx of higher-complexity filesystems certainly worries
me a little.
