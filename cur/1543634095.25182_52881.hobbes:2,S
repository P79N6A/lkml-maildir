Subject: [patch] cli() preemption fix, 2.5.22
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

the attached patch should fix a bug in __global_cli(). One failure
scenario: if irqs-enabled syscall-level code calls cli() then we might get
a preemption right after the 'cpu' assignment, but before the __cli(). The
task might be moved to another CPU, and from that point on evil things
might happen, get_irqlock() will do wild things if 'cpu' is not the
current one. This is a one-instruction race but should be well possible to
trigger. Comments?
