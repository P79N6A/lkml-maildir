I could do that, however my thinking was that if I added it to an
existing file then it would add to the existing nested include bloat.
For example <asm/dma.h> for i386 has 10 inline functions and includes
<linux/config.h>, <linux/spinlock.h>, <asm/io.h> and <linux/delay.h>.
Seems kind of excessive just to get one macro that ends up being the
empty string, and I would prefer not to force people to include all
that just to declare a structure.
Best,
  Roland
