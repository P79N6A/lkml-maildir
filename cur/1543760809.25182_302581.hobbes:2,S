Hi Stephen,
It looks very good now, I have just a couple of comments and I as far as
I concerned it is ready for inclusion.

Is it possible to change it for positive (something like middle_button
which would show 1 for enabled - default - and 0 for disabled). But this
is my personal preference, others may disagree.

It looks like your mailer has wrapped the patch.
Also the patch has some trailing whitespace. If you are using vim the
foillowing in .vimrc will show all trailing spaces in all their glory:
highlight RedundantWhitespace ctermbg=red guibg=red
match RedundantWhitespace /\s\+$\| \+\ze\t/
