OK, what I was thinking, is that the user could create a new
namespace, that has all the filesystems remounted 'nosuid'.  This
wouldn't need any new kernel infrastructure, just a suid-root program
(e.g. newns_nosuid), that would do a clone(CLONE_NEWNS), then
recursively remount everything 'nosuid' in the new namespace.  Then
restore the user's privileges, and exec a shell.
In this namespace the user could mount things to his heart's content.
He could mount over system directories or even the root directory,
without being able to do any harm.
This is very nice, but a bit inpractical, since now all the other
programs of the user, his desktop environment, login shells etc. Won't
be able to see the userspace filesystems mounted in the private
namespace.
Of course he can enter the private namespace immediately after login,
but then he won't be able to send mail for example, because 'sendmail'
could be suid-mail or whatever.
I think the following must be true, for a namespace environment to be
useful:
 1) All the processes should be able to access the same files
    (including new mounts)
 2) User should be able to run suid/sgid programs
If the suid/sgid programs want to access the contents of a userspace
filesystem, that's tough.  You can't have that, because it's insecure.
But experience shows that this isn't a problem.  The exception is the
'mount' program itself, and that is why I'm slowly working towards
making sys_mount() and sys_umount() unprivileged.
