The task is only "unhashed" after the counters have been added in 
__exit_signal. See release_task in kernel/exit.c

__exit_signal takes various locks that will insure the proper sequencing.

AFAIK release task is always called for task removal.

There are significant performance benefits in particular for one standard 
NUMA benchmark that keeps calling sys_times over and over. I believe other 
programs may exhibit the same brain dead behavior.
