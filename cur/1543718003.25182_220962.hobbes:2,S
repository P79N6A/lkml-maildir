Dmitry,
I've reverse applyied the patch on my laptop and desktop and the 
keyboard is fine. However, my USB optical mouse is also hardly 
manageable. I've seen other post on the synaptic touchpad beeing jumppy 
but for me it is an USB optical mouse (It's branded Asus but I think it 
is a logitech optical well mouse...)
FYI...
