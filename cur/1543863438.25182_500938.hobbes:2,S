   Yes, what prevents userspace daemon watching /dev/input/event* to
   provide this functionality?
Well that was my first attempt. Just an hack, but it works. Nonetheless I found
the kernel-level approach fitting better the problem: it is elegant, simpler
and more efficient than user-level one.
For example, the subsystem provides at kernel-level handy
hiberante/suspend/resume callbacks that I use to turn on/off the timer,
avoiding the time-warp problem. Doing that at user-level would be far more
messy...
