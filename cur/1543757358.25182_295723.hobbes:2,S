Sorry, but a diff of what? Of the list?

IBM ThinkPad T42p (2373-GTG [1])  acpi_sleep=s3_bios (2)
More info available upon request, but in general:
- Debian unstable
- vanilla kernel 2.6.10
- ACPI patch 20050125
- BlueZ patch -mh4
- IBM trackpoint patch [2]
- radeonfb
- radeon XFree86 4.3.0.dfsg.1-11
- all modules my laptop support installed (and loaded ;-) )
- I used a script that switch to vc1 and stop mysql (this is a known
  problem [3] [4]), then "echo -n [mem|disk] > /sys/power/state"
I've a working S4 with the same configuration, too. But it seems I
still suffer a problem about hwclock I already reported with another
laptop [5] [6]. In this case, the command proposed seems not working
anymore (I should test more deeply, just a question of time ;-) ).
Anyway, this laptop works very well!
I've also a docking station [7], I'll test with it ASAP.
Thx, bye,
Gismo / Luca
