You seem to be agreeing with me to a certain extent. What I'm saying is
that there _can_ be no difference between EXPORT_SYMBOL() and
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(). We might as well stick to one or the other.
As you say -- if the GPL covers modules, EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL is redundant.
If it does not, then EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL in itself is a GPL violation.
The point of EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL, however, is that it is a technical
restriction which needs to be circumvented in order to load a non-GPL
module. That does affect the outcome of a court case when the licence is
violated, and that's why I think we should it throughout.
However, if your lawyers promise you that the court won't rule that the
GPL covers modules, then you have nothing to fear from EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL
because (according to your lawyers) the court will rule that it means no
more than EXPORT_SYMBOL does. That's your risk to take; there's no
reason why we should use EXPORT_SYMBOL _anywhere_ until/unless a court
actually makes that ruling.
