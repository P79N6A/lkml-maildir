it was not my goal to make it harder for people to build 2.4.
I'd in fact consider userspace and hardware support the real problems 
for people who want to use kernel 2.4 - using a different compiler is
a relatively easy issue compared to this.
And I had mixed two complete different points in this thread:
- untested kernel 2.4 / gcc 4
- kernel 2.6 shouldn't be in any respect worse than kernel 2.4
Looking at the kenrel size, it seems the latter is far from being true 
in this respect.  :-(
The "untested" still applies.
But I do also understand your points regardingthis issue.
If I was 2.4 maintainer, I wouldn't apply the patch to allow gcc 4.
But you are the 2.4 maintainer, and it's therefore your decision.
