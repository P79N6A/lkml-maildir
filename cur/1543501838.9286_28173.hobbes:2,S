How about, no computer to hook it to?  Not everyone has tons of hardware.
How about, the other computer isn't running something that can run a
serial dump catch program?
His question was, how to catch a dump without serial cables, what ever the
reason, and without writing out something that is large an meaningless to
most people.
Writing down the entire oops isn't going to happen with people migrating from MS
products.  "BlueScreen? Reboot! Who cares what the dump says if rebooting
fixes it?" is the attitude of most MS users/techs.
Even those that are usually willing, don't have the time at that moment.
Some of the bugs that need to be fixed the most are the ones that happen
unexpectedly.
Ciao!
