Finally got around to downloading the broken-out 2.6.17-rc6-mm2 and when
I applied it a bunch of these came out:
  Applying patch documentation-ioctl-messtxt-start-tree-wide-ioctl-registry.patch
  missing header for unified diff at line 4854 of patch
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Applying patch post-halloween-doc.patch
  Applying patch kgdb-core-lite.patch

  Applying patch lock-validator-special-locking-kgdb.patch
  Applying patch kgdb-core-lite-add-reboot-command.patch
  Applying patch kgdb-8250.patch
  Applying patch kgdb-8250-fix.patch
  Applying patch kgdb-netpoll_pass_skb_to_rx_hook.patch
  Applying patch kgdb-eth.patch
  Applying patch kgdb-i386-lite.patch
  Applying patch kgdb-cfi_annotations.patch
  missing header for unified diff at line 1423 of patch
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Seems mostly harmless, as the changes applied anyway, but those headers do
look strange: the '---' lines are missing a directory name:
  diff -puN Makefile~kgdb-cfi_annotations Makefile
