The 1000Hz thing came much later, and I never noticed any impact of that 
on my machines.
(Note that this is all entrely subjective. I was very disappointed in the
feel of the first HT P4 machine I had for the first few weeks, but apart
from running lmbench - which looked ok even though it shows that P4's are
bad at system calls - I've not actually put numbers on it. But my feeling
was that the irq thing made a noticeable difference. Caveat emptor -
subjective feelings are not good).

The rebalancing was certainly done with a 100Hz clock, so yes, it might 
have become much worse lately.
