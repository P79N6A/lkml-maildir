Not if the code is written in C, which it seems to be.
It'll be true if the result of fork() is true, or false otherwise. pid will
be assigned the result of fork() in either case. As fork() returns 0 (false)
in the child, and the PID of the child in the parent (true), what's the
problem?[1]
S.
[1] Assuming fork() doesn't fail of course, which is reasonable in test code.
