Dear All :
this question suppose not posted in the mailing list,since  I have  been posted
it on GNU compiler mailing list , and get no reponse. I posted it here to get
your help .
We licence MIPS CPU without MAC (the module support multiplication and division
functions).
For the convenience sake , we use ( *, / ) instead of (+ ,-)  in the c programs.
in  the gcc man document , this kind of function is not menstioned.
Does anyone meet the same question ,  and know how to solve it ?
