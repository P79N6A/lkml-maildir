Hi Juan,
I don't think MAP_PRIVATE quite fits the bill because pages become divorced from the file; msync() and munmap() seem no longer to reflect changes back to disk. I want to keep that association as it is efficient.
Thanks for the MAP_NORESERVE ... didn't know about that vital flag.
regards,
Chris
