Git versions keep incrementing but no fix for:
  BUILD   arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage
Root device is (3, 2)
Boot sector 512 bytes.
Setup is 4696 bytes.
System is 1530 kB
Kernel: arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage is ready  (#1)
  Building modules, stage 2.
  MODPOST
WARNING: vmlinux: 'strlen' exported twice. Previous export was in vmlinux
WARNING: drivers/acpi/processor.o - Section mismatch: reference to .init.data:
from .text between 'acpi_processor_power_init' (at offset 0x1495) and
'acpi_processor_power_exit'
  CC      arch/x86_64/kernel/cpufreq/powernow-k8.mod.o
  LD [M]  arch/x86_64/kernel/cpufreq/powernow-k8.ko
Has been like that since "kbuild: check for section mismatch during
modpost stage" went in to catch these things. AKA:
