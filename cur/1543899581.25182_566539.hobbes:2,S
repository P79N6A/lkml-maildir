Frankly I think there are more of us running old cards on PC hardware 
than people running ARM! And for a number of card for old buses like 
ISA, EISA, and VESA, the e100 has not worked. These are old PCs 
converted to routers and firewalls, and for security should not be left 
without upgrades.

If you think the e100 driver fixes your problems use it and be happy. 
But since you don't have to test system behavior with the new driver, 
and you won't be called at night or on weekends if it doesn't work, do 
the rest of the world a favor and stop taking out things we know to 
work! Leaving in the eepro100 causes no work for you, and even if e100 
works perfectly it needs to be validated in any sane network. it still 
makes work.
