optimal result is not losing covering for ranges that is originally
covered, and still keep as many of spare mtrr entries for X server
driver.
we only have 8 mtrrs, could lose some covering because of run out of mtrr regs.
So we need to search it according to chunk/gran with ram ranges that
is defined by old mtrr layout.
and if we can not find the optimal setting, user could select one
setting (chunk/gran size) to boot next time, but he will lose some
covering.
for some regions. later trim_mtrr will remove those range from e820 map
