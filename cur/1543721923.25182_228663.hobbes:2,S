Well, there can be rules like  "writes after flush with size less than x are
atomic". With X beeing something between sector size, blocksize or data
journal size.
However most unix programs  which do not do yournalling and rely on some
stable atomic behaviour work with generating new files and renaming that.
And for this the meta data journalling in ordered mode is fine. 
So only the append only logfiles may need some special treatment, this looks
like a common source for null-bytes in a file. And only in case it is not a
temp file, its a problem (syslog)
