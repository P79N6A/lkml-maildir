If you really want to help the MS peoples get Linux, consider a straight port 
of UML to Windows.
I've been trying to encourage someone to do this for a while, with limited 
success :-(  Enough has been done that I think I know what the main obstacles 
are, and I think I know that it's possible.
So, if you're interested (and have the appropriate Win-fu) let me know, and 
grab the code and start porting...
