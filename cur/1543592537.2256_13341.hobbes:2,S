When you talk about avoiding copying, are you thinking of not copying
the runlists, as well? If so, how can you avoid uncompressing them?
That seems very complicated, plus you have to concatenate the pieces
of the runlist if they span multiple MFT records, anyway.

I guess this answers my question - you will continue to uncompress the
runlist when opening the inode, right?
