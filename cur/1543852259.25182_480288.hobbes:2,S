I think we could live with the binutils requirement as long as we can find
some automagic way of not breaking people's `make allmodconfig'.  Because
quite a lot of those people who do cross-compilation tend to use older
binutilses.
But I don't know how to do that.  We _could_ do a trick similar to the
`cc-version' make rule, and then use the new `as-version' to make the whole
kvm.o compile down to an empty .o file.  But that's pretty hacky.  Would
really prefer something at Kconfig-time, but we have no way of letting the
assembler version feed into the Kconfig system (nor do we want it, I
suspect).
