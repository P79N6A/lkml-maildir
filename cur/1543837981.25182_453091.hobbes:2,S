Right, thanks. Hmm, its the last occurence of that function, even

Euhm, right :-) long comes naturaly when I think about quantities op
pages. The adjust_memalloc_reserve() argument is an increment, a delta;
perhaps I should change that to long.

Having them separate would allow ajust_memalloc_reserve() to be used by
other callers too (would need some extra locking).
