The proc stuff is fake anyways. I would not worry about that. The biggest 
worry is the locking mechanism to make this clean.
There are three possibilites:
1. do what cpusets is doing by versioning.
2. Have the task notifier access the task_struct information.
See 
http://lwn.net/Articles/145232/
 "A new path to the refrigerator"
3. Maybe the easiest: Require mmap_sem to be taken for all policy 
accesses. Currently its only require for vma policies. Then we need
to make a copy of the policy at some point so that alloc_pages can
access policy information lock free. This may also allow us to fix
the bind issue if we would f.e. keep a bitmap in the taskstruct or (ab)use 
the cpusets map.

This code already exist in the memory hotplug code base and Ray already 
had a working implementation for page migration. The migration code will 
also be necessary in order to relocate pages with ECC single bit failures 
that Russ is working on (of course that will only work for some pages) and
for Mel Gorman's defragmentation approach (if we ever get the split into 
differnet types of memory chunks in).
