select considers the broken pipe an error that needs reporting so it goes
ready. Processes that are network aware normally set SIGPIPE to SIG_IGN.
The default behaviour comes from a desire that non aware programs
shouldn't get stuck spinning on a network error but go away.
If you ignore the signal you'll get a event from select, and then an
error code.
