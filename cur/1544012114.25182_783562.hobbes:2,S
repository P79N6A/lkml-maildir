I think, the question is rather "can a driver be written for IPU to 
support some sane hardware-neutral image data manipulation API, like v4l?" 
Then you can start writing any user-space apps on top of that API. So, as 
long as there is such an API, I think, we can put it on IPU, yes. My 
problems ATM is - no use-case. What concerns overlay, it is not used in 
the current application, as for image format conversion from the camera - 
I only have a Bayer camera to test with. I even cannot test monochrome 
sanely, because of a lack of a cable:-) And Bayer and monochrome don't 
make good candidates for such conversions - they are not supported by the 
IPU.

I'll have a look, but as I said: -ENOUSER:-)

Ok, no problem. Let's just decide
1. is the drivers/dma the final location.
2. do dmaengine maintainers accept it in present form or require any 
   amendments.
3. which interrupts we make visible by default for irq_desc[] and what 
   granularity we want to enable the rest (we could even just make 
   CONFIG_ALL_IPU_IRQS and be 95% sure noone will ever need them.)
4. throw away every trace of overlay support - if anyone ever needs it 
   they should be able to dig it out in ML archives.
Thanks
