Hmmm, I found the patch, but that didn't help. (I suspect you're talking about
the matroxfb-2.5.72 patch mentioned on the list)

I found the keyboard setting, after which the VT support came available. Wierd
that I didn't find it myself, as my laptop has no problems with 2.6 (accept
that I need to recompile the pcmcia package) and it's not using a framebuffer.
It compiled without a problem this time. I'm afraid I have to test it tomorrow,
as my boss prefers me to be awake at work. (and I prefer to be awake when
driving there ;-))
