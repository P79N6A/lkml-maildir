The hardware engineers, in my experience, will not refer to those issues
as bugs, but rather as misdocumented features... No?  I mean if an
errata is enough to work around the problem, then the documentation was
clearly the problem, and not the hardware implementation.
As per the microcode updates, I noticed RedHat 8 was autoupdating
microcode on each boot IIRC. I've since switched to Debian and don't
know that it does this.  Should I be concerned?
