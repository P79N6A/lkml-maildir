It made sense to disable interrupts early because we used to setup the
segments and overwrite the page tables from the c code. My patch moves
the segment handling and page table switching code into the assembly
routine, and one of the first things the assembly code does is:
	/* zero out flags, and disable interrupts */
	pushl $0
	popfl
So I think we should be safe. Thanks for checking!
