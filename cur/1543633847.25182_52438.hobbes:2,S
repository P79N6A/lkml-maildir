Can someone clarify for me the need of pci_request_irq??
pci_enable_device() assigns the IRQ in routing, but it is not enabled 
until you call request_irq.  I don't see any simplification that can be 
done in the PCI API.
The only thing I've wanted is a cross-platform way to detect if 
pdev->irq returned by pci_enable_device is valid.
