Here's smartctl -a for this drive - same output for both sda and sdb. 
Smartd is currently running.  Any advice appreciated.
Previously on 2.6.15 I was seeing sdb remount as readonly under heavy 
i/o.  I have not seen that issue yet with 2.6.21 (with Robert's patch 
from May 5th for sata_nv), but that occurrence of remounts read-only was 
infrequently, so that issue may be solved.
