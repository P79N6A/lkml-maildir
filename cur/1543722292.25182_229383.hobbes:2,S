Spose so - __printk_ratelimit().  Or simply turn the message off until the
next reboot.

I know.  I was asking whether that could should have used the macro rather
than open-coding the task_lock().  Whatever.

That comment describes what data structures are protected by task_lock(). 
If you're aware of missing info or if you're protecting new data via
task_lock(), please update the comment.

OK.  The term "remote control" has not been defined by you, so I'm to
assume that it refers to one process initiating perfctr instrumentation
against another, in some fashion.  Please feel my minor frustration ;)

hm, not sure I understand that, but whatever.  Please fix up the big stack
users, especially those which do copy_*_user, or non-atomic memory
allocations.
