Even though BUG_ON() includes unlikely(), this introduces additional 
tests in very hot paths.
_Why_ do we need this at all?
I would prefer to NAK the patch, and fix the odd user that gets it 
wrong.  It becomes REALLY obvious that a driver has gotten this wrong, 
REALLY quickly.
I see no need to burden critical hot paths with dumb checks like this.
