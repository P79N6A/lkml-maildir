pavel, start using "e1000e" instead - this driver replaces e1000 for all the
pci-express devices and has the infamous L1 ASPM disable patch to fix this issue.
make sure you have CONFIG_E1000E=m/y in your .config, otherwise the old e1000 code
will drive your card, and that driver does not have the fix.
BAH, this is a good example how Linus' patch can wreak havoc - a lot of people
will now not see fixes since they only go into e1000e, but people can unnoticed
now go and use e1000 for too long...
