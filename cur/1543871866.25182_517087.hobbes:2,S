Nice!
I tried to port this to ppc64 but found a few problems:
The 64bit powerpc ABI has the concept of a TOC (r2) which is used for
per function data. This means this wont work:
        if (ah->restore_stack) {
                set_task_stack_reg(new_task, ah->restore_stack);
                task_ip_reg(new_task) = ah->restore_ip;
                /*
                 * The return code 0 is needed to tell the
                 * head user-context that the threadlet went async:
                 */
                task_ret_reg(new_task) = 0;
        }
I think we would want to change restore_ip to restore_function, and then
create a per arch helper, perhaps:
void set_user_context(struct task_struct *task, unsigned long stack,
		      unsigned long function, unsigned long retval);
ppc64 could then grab the ip and r2 values from the function descriptor.
The other issue involves the syscall table:
asmlinkage struct syslet_uatom __user *
sys_async_exec(struct syslet_uatom __user *uatom,
               struct async_head_user __user *ahu)
{
        return __sys_async_exec(uatom, ahu, sys_call_table, NR_syscalls);
}
This exposes the layout of the syscall table. Unfortunately it wont work
on ppc64. In arch/powerpc/kernel/systbl.S:
#define COMPAT_SYS(func)        .llong  .sys_##func,.compat_sys_##func
Both syscall tables are overlaid.
