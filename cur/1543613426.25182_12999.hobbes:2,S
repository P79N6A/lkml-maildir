  Umm. I don't think it's good idea (at least with current state) - if any
data was written to inode, quota was dirtified and probably never written
so you're going to have *lots* of inodes with dirty quota... So you end up
freeing nothing.
  I think that leaving writing of dquots on bdflush or some other thread
would be better solution...
