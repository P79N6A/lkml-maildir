I am developing a device driver for a custom on board ethernet driver on a new 
custom PPC board.  The difficulty seems to be occuring on arp requests.  After 
configuring the eth0 device and then attempting to send it an arp request, the 
device passes the packet to the arp.c(arp_rcv) function, where it tests for 
arp_hln and arp_pln.  Both of these are at 0xff instead of the correct values.  
Where are the skb->hn.arp->arp_hln and pln initialized?  I was unable to gleem 
this information from the source code.  There might very well be missing 
binary/configuration files as well as an incorrectly configured kernel.  TIA.
