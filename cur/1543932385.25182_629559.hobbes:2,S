Subject: [PATCH 0/5] atmel_serial: Cleanups, irq handler splitup & DMA
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following patchset cleans up the atmel_serial driver a bit,
moves a significant portion of the interrupt handler into a tasklet,
and adds DMA support. This is the result of a combined effort by Chip
Coldwell, Remy Bohmer and me. The patches should apply cleanly onto
Linus' latest git tree.
It all seems to behave both with and without DMA enabled, but I'll do
some more testing tomorrow.
Note that break and error handling doesn't work too well with DMA
enabled. This is a common problem with all the efforts I've seen
adding DMA support to this driver (including my own). I'm tempted to
just ignore the problem for now and hopefully come up with a solution
later.
Everyone, please give it a try and/or review the code.
PS: Andrew, I'm sending it to you because I believe you're the
maintainer of this driver, although MAINTAINERS doesn't say anything
about it. Please let me know if this isn't how you want it.
