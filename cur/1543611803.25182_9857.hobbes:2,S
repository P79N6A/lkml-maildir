YES!  Same problem here.  HP Pavilion N5430 (Duron/ALI MAgik1 notebook).
Seems to happen a lot under X as well.  2.4.16 (been happening for a long time).
Machine seems to freeze up, w/ interrupts disabled, but just hitting the
power switch for a quick second (not long enough to shut it off), seems to
make the machine unstuck.  Happens a lot for me if i happen to switch
consoles to X and start using the touchpad before X is fully switched in.
been bothering me for a while...
