This information is next to useless. At least report
 - what did you do that caused the oops message?
 - what kernel version, exactly, are you using
   - can you reproduce it with other (newer) kernel versions, too?
   - can you reproduce it on other machines, too?
 - how does your kernel configuration look like?
(btw, your previous message about loading a module makes me wonder if you 
understand enough of Linux to understand what people here might propose 
that you do to solve the problem.  There are are many places where people 
who are new to Linux can request help, but the kernel mailing list is 
probably not one of those...)
