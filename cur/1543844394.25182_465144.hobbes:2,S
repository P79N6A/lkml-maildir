I don't think it's harmless. My Ultra5 has an add-on PCI USB controller
card (Belkin). A 2.6.18-rc kernel compiled with gcc-4.1.1 will throw a few
unaligned accesses when I initialise USB by inserting a USB memory stick.
Removing the memory stick then results in PCI errors and other breakage.
The same kernel compiled with gcc-3.4.6 has no problems at all, so I've
been assuming it's a gcc-4 issue and not a kernel issue.
