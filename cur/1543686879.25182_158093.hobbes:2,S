We are not talking about ARP Replies, we are talking about ARP
Requests.
You can see the Richard post here, same issue I reported several weeks
ago:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-net&m=106094924813337&w=2
==
	On eth0, we see:
11:23:55.650514 0:4:75:ca:c4:ef Broadcast arp 42: arp who-has
10.10.10.1
tell 212.xxx.yyy.9
==
Linux is sending an ARP Request to a LAN where the source IP address of
the packet has not any sense in that IP network.
And, at least, 2 RFCs are stating that other devices should not reply
to this packet. Currently know Cisco, Foundry; possibly others, and
possibly others coming as ARP storms are not desired.
