I favoured simplicity over optimisation here, as it's not a speed critical path.

I've not pulled Linus' bk tree, but have noticed from the changelogs
that some changes went in already touching this file.

Erk.

Agreed. I assumed the Linus just didn't add the "pre1" part to EXTRAVERSION
yet but, given that 2.5.8 doesn't compile for a lot of people, I can see
why pushing 2.5.9 out sooner would be a good thing.
I've been busy with x86-64 bits and other projects the last few days, I'll
continue pushing more bits from my tree (including the bluesmoke bits) to
Linus over the weekend.
    Dave.
