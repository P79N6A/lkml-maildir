Thanks Avi.
So now its open how this will be merged alltogether. We can merge it in
three steps (first from Dave's tree, then Avi and at last my IOMMU
updates which has to happen in that order).
The other option is to merge this all with one pull-request I send to
Linus. It should not conflict with your updates Avi because all these
changes apply also cleanly to current linus/master.
Is this acceptable for everyone?
David, its important to hear your opinion on that because this single
pull-request would include all VT-d updates you have queued in your
tree? Is this ok for you?
