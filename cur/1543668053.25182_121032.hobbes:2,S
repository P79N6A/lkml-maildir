It would be a positive signal to net hygiene if you simply drop sites
which do such bounces off the list with a final message to the
subscriber and its postmaster with an automated message for the
reason.
Spam-Filtering is one thing. Harassing the LKM list admins because the
spam filtering got out of control is not.
And people starting to change their message subjects to be
"politically correct" because any combination of the letters "x", "x"
and "x" gets rejected is simply a bad sign.  IMHO.
