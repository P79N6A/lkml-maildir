DU4.0 does the same as we do (as of 2.2.7): it sends a 'getattr' that
is used for cache revalidation upon opening of the file, and that's
it...
I haven't made a full investigation (perhaps people with Solaris, or
SGI clients could check this out with a 'tcpdump') but my impression
has been that read-caching implies that atime is not updated. This is
why I've ignored earlier calls to do so.
