it follows closely the kernel coding style as layout within the kernel
documentation. However there are some minor style things, that I am
going to enforce from time to time. Like having the container_of or
get_user_data calls at the top of the variable declaration. This has
never formalized as far as I recall, but makes from my point of view the
code clearer and easier to read.
Some other times I like an extra empty line to more visual separate
different code blocks. For this some people might agree with me others
might disagree. It is fully a personal more liking one way over the
other.
When it comes to indentation and placement of braces etc. I is 100% the
kernel coding style and nothing else. If not, then it needs fixing and
is an oversight from the old days.
Regards
Marcel
