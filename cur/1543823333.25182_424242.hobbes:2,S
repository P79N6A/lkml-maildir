Thanks for doing this Joachim.  I like the result.
But the duplicate key code is a bit too much.  The fact that AES does
it should only serve as a reminder for us to fix it, not to create even
more duplication.
So could you please move the key generation code into a separate file,
say crypto/twofish-common.c which can then be shared by all twofish
implementations?
BTW, please include the actual patches the next time you submit them
along with Signed-off-by lines.  You should consult the file
Documentation/SubmittingPatches for detailed instructions.
Thanks,
