I have no idea why the -ac kernel happens to work in your case. The
following is the standard RH message on the subject. Since -ac works and
2.4.16/17 doesn't I'd be suspicious that you may be seeing a different
problem. 
---------------------
Most implementations using the 440GX chipset require the "apic"
option to function correctly.  When this is the case, providing
DMI information to Red Hat as documented below[1] may allow us to
automate that setting in the future.
On some systems, the "apic" boot flag may not work.  Unfortunately,
because of Intel Proprietary information, these platforms are not
supported at this time.

http://people.redhat.com/arjanv/dmidecode.c
    gcc dmidecode.c -o dmidecode
    ./dmidecode | \
       mail -s 'requires apic option to install' hardwarebugs-list@redhat.com
---------------------
Intel to my knowledge are still failing to provide either BIOSes with
suitable $PIR IRQ routing table data or explanations of how to work around
the problems with the 440GX. You may wish to consult your supplier for
advice, especially if the machine was sold to you for the purpose of
running Linux.
