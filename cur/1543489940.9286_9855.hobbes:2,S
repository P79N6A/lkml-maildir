Hello, all!
I have gotten 2.2.2 to crash once (several days of uptime) and 2.2.3 to
crash in a similar manner (only a few hours of uptime). I mean a hard
freeze as in no keyboard, no ping, but no reboot either, just halt.
Nothing in the logs. XFree86 (3.3.2.3 or whatever debian potato uses) and
ALSA 0.3.0-pre4. And an assortment of x86 hardware (SMP kernel).
The only thing I noticed was just before 2.2.3 crashed, I ran "display"
for a bunch pictures. In the middle of the viewing session it spat a bunch
of "out of memory" -type messages on the xterm it was running from and
then everything was at a halt. After the crash "display" worked all right
and I was able to view all the pictures, so this isn't (easily)
reproducible.
This may be a feature of ALSA. If anyone thinks so, please feel free to
forward this to alsa mailing lists (but I guess it won't help them
either). No, I wasn't playing sound at the time of the crash, but alsa
modules (snd-interwave, snd-pcm1-oss) were loaded.
Please notice, however, that 2.2.0-pre4 (with ALSA) had over a month of
uptime before I "upgraded" ;)
More info available on request.
