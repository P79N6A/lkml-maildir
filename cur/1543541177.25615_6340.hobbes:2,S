Now that my message has gained legitamacy through word wrapping, since people's
email clients don't seem to be able to flow text, could I get an answer to my
questions?  God, I didn't think that my mailer was that 31337.
Do you get the impression also that getting any real questions addressed is a
bit difficult?  ;-)  (Still no real response to my original *polite*
inquiry...) (<-- look Alan, no caps!)
My question still remains:  What is a feature, and what is a bug fix?  And
what
are the real criteria for making it into the kernel?  "Technical merit" is not
an acceptable answer.  On "technical merit" Linux makes a horrible can opener.
(But I'm sure a salesman could sell it as such anyway...)
Some <open>ness here would be appreciated...
