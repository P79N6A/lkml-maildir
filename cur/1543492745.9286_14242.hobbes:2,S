As far as I know, there should be no real problem.  If something has
changed, eg CONFIG_MODULES is now known as CONFIG_COOL_MODULES, then my
guess is it would just quietly ignore this, and you'd be still without
modules or cool modules.
This shouldn't happen though (why would it?), so I say go ahead.  'make
oldconfig' is also a handy way to reuse your old .config in a new kernel
(try it, it's hours of fun).
