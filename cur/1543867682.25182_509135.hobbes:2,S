Though apparently there are enough people out there who want the
benefits of Linux that it's viable for them to make the L version which 
is capable of running Linux :)
Amusingly, the place I acquired my GL from sells the non-Linux WRT54G 
for 65.90€ and the WRT54GL for €64.90. The WRT54GS (S for speedboost?) 
is €81.90.
