nice, so I can avoid referencing the mmap()ed region in steps of 4096 bytes. 
in your suggested solution:
 ptr=mmap(blah)
 mlock(ptr, ...)
 munmap(ptr, len)
can I avoid an munlock(ptr,...) call after  mmap()ed buffer is no longer needed,
will mmap() re-utilize that region on the next call, or could this  avoiding of
munlock() cause the kernel to get short of free pages ?
( Just a paranoid idea :-) )
But as stated in man munmap :
---
       The munmap system call deletes the mappings for the speci-
       fied address  range,  and  causes  further  references  to
       addresses within the range to generate invalid memory ref-
       erences.
---
I guess since the page does not longer exist , there is no reason to
keep the page locked into mem.

Benno.
