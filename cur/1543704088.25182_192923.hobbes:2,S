Actually, I would have done nothing but for some 2.6 migration reports
of total lockups with the then in tree aic79xx driver.  The patch that
went into the tree was tested by the people reporting the lockups.

You haven't outlined any incorrect cases in your emails, just could do
better cases.  If you have all these bug reports that you haven't been
passing on, could you at least distil them to the mid layer failure
scenario that we can discuss fixing?

Well, in coming up with the mid layer changes from 2.4 to 2.6 I did look
at what issues the main drivers had work arounds for. I used these work
arounds and an email you sent in September 2002 as the basis for a lot
of the mid-layer changes in 2.6.  None of the other drivers does this
timer interception and the issue wasn't mentioned in your email, so I am
dubious about the seriousness of the impact.
The way fixes get into linux is either lots of people complain, or one
person sends a fix, neither has happened in this case, which again leads
me to suspect that it's not a huge problem.
The still outstanding question is, now that you have a clearer idea what
being a Maintainer entails, do you wish to be the maintainer for
aic7xxx?
