Hello,
I am running Linux 2.2.12:
neal@colo:~$ cat /proc/version
Linux version 2.2.12 (root@gondor) (gcc version 2.95.1 19990816 (release))
#1 Sun Sep 12 00:22:57 EST 1999
Starting twelve days ago the load average has increased by one every
twenty-four hours.  Normally, it remains close to 0.  At the moment, they
are at twelve; I imagine that tomorrow, they will be at thirteen: 
neal@colo:~$ w
 11:08am  up 330 days, 17:36,  1 user,  load average: 12.08, 12.05, 12.01
 USER     TTY      FROM              LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU  WHAT
 neal     ttyp0    qui182p.star.net 10:02am  0.00s  0.33s  0.12s  w
Other than this, the system appears to be functioning normally.  I do not
know where to start looking for the bug, however, I will be happy to
provide any additional details that could be of help.
Regards,
-Neal
