How about:
/**
 * link_css_set - a helper function to link a css_set to a cgroup
 * @ tmp_cg_links: cg_cgroup_link objects allocated by allocate_cg_links()
 * @ cg: the css_set to be linked
 * @ cgrp: the destination cgroup
 */
static void link_css_set(struct list_head *tmp_cg_links,
			 struct css_set *cg, struct cgroup *cgrp)

Because we are linking all the css_sets to the root cgroup, so I think root_cgrp
helps readability.
