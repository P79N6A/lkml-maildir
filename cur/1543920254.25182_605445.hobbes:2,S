64-bit parisc tests if /usr/bin/hppa64-linux-gnu- exists.
If yes, it sets CROSS_COMPILE to hppa64-linux-gnu-.
If no, it sets CROSS_COMPILE to hppa64-linux-
32-bit parisc unconditionally sets CROSS_COMPILE to hppa-linux-.
This still breaks Rob's setup if his compiler is called differently.
Anyway, here's a try to make it autodetect m68k-linux-gnu-gcc and
m68k-linux-gcc. Perhaps it can be generalized in kbuild, to allow
arch/*/Makefile to set a list of possible cross-compiler prefixes?

m68k: Improve cross-compiler autodetection
Set CROSS_COMPILE to m68k-linux-gnu- resp. m68k-linux-, but only if such a
cross compiler is found in your $PATH
