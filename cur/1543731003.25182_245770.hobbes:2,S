It will succeed on the _name_ of the device, but it won't open the device 
node. It would open the _directory_ node associated with that name.
Think of it this way: a pathname always points to one "container". That 
container is either a directory or a single node - and O_DIRECTORY ends up 
being the thing that chooses between them.

But that filesystem cannot know what the _other_ filesystem configurations 
are. And that's what you'd have to have to mount.

Yes, that would work, but it's of questionable use. If you want autofs, 
then just _use_ autofs.
