The fact is that I'm a (slight kind of) legasthemic on my own, and
therefore
I know the difference between what's laziness and a real problem
of the person himself. BTW. If one is getting at the level
of "RasterMan" then he should just seriously consider to use
some kind of automated help/advice (ispell). That's  one of the things
computers are good at, at least. So, well the "insult" on my site was
fully intentional.
