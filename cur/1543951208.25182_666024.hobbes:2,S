Still not helping.  How would a driver know what names to use?
Are those names globally scoped, or local to the device?
Again, "id" and "dev" are unspecified.  I can maybe guess that
you're trying to make this look like <linux/clk.h> ... except
the clock API includes kernel doc in that header.
I *strongly* think new interfaces should not be provided without
documentation... but that's what this patch does.

I'm still not following.  If there's only one user, why would
you need refcounting?  If your model here is the clock API,
then you should support multiple users ... and then refcounting
is very appropriate.
