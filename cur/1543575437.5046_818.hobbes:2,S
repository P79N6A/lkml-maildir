Actually, it is fair.  There are really two results,
1) 309 sec for 2.2.18p26 vs  318 sec for 2.4.0t12p7 where the
   task was building 2.2.18p26 using kgcc.
2) 444 sec for 2.2.18p26 vs  457.3 sec for 2.4.0t12p7 where the
   task was building 2.4.0t12p7 using gcc.
In each case, the task and the tools used are the same.  The
only difference was the kernel used. In both cases, 2.2.18 won by 3%.  Its 
comparing apples to apples and oranges to oranges. Granted 3% isn't
very much, but I would have guessed that 2.4.0 would have been the
winner.  It wasn't, at least for this single processor machine.
Now, if you're saying that 2.4.0-test12 will get the job done faster when 
compiled using kgcc, that's something else.  I'll try that out to see if it 
makes a difference.
