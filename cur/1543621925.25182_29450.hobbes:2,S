I assume that the nano files are in a shadow tree.  You can convert
base plus shadow trees to a single view by
  make -f $KBUILD_SRCTREE_000/Makefile-2.5 $KBUILD_OBJTREE/.tmp_src
$KBUILD_OBJTREE/.tmp_src will be built as a directory containing 10,000
symlinks pointing at the relevant source files.
  diff -urN $KBUILD_SRCTREE_000 $KBUILD_OBJTREE/.tmp_src
to generate a patch from base to base+shadow.  Use that diff against a
separate copy of the base tree as a starting point for kbuild 2.4.
