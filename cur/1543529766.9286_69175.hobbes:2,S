this still does not catch the above bug :-) a slightly better
(IRQ-context) spinlock-debugging method is IMHO running an SMP kernel on a
real SMP system, with:
	append='maxcpus=1'
in lilo.conf, it has the advantage of the UP kernels' heavy rescheduling,
and has the NMI watchdog in case some spinlock bug causes a lockup... And
nothing beats running a real SMP system, the more subtle spinlock bugs
simply do not show up on UP.
