Yes, I was incorrect.  The vountary kernel preemption patch takes
sections that are non-preemptible (aka holding a spinlock) and that
would otherwise run for an unbounded time and adds logic to break out of
those loops, releasing any locks, in order to allow a higher priority
process to run.  It is voluntary because even though you are in a
non-preemptible section you voluntarily release any locks and yield to a
higher priority process.  It has nothing to do with the BKL as such.
