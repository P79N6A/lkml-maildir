Fair enough.  I agree that having something more generic at the hook
level would be ideal.  I'm interested in what others might think about
this.

Right, but we like inotify and want to see it succeed :-)!  We also
want an upstream solution, so playing nicely is essential.

It's a reasonable compromise and it'll have to be considered and discussed.

Most definately.  Thanks for the reply.
