No, I mean clone(CLONE_NEWNS) and unshare(CLONE_NEWNS).  Without
tracking those, it seems like a convoluted sequence of mounting,
unmonting, and mount sharing and unsharing could potentially confuse
your policy or your admins...
I haven't fully thought it through.  But at least if an admin makes a
policy update with an expectation that all processes have the same mount
trees the result could be unsafe.

Don't require it, but that statement is only meaningful if you then
prevent it, no?

If the patches solve your problem, and you respond saying "TOMOYO needs
these patches too", it just might get the thread going.

Sounds good.
