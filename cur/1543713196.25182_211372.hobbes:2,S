Subject: chown() not POSIX compliant in 2.2.* and 2.4.*

Hi,
I noted that chown will not always take away the SGID bit from 
nondirectories. Posix says the following about it (taken from [1]):
"If the path argument refers to a regular file, the set-user-ID 
(S_ISUID) and set-group-ID (S_ISGID) bits of the file mode shall be 
cleared upon successful return from chown(), unless the call is made by 
process with appropriate privileges [=root], in which case it is 
implementation defined whether those bits are altered."
As far as I can tell the 2.6.* kernel is Posix compliant as it will 
always remove both SUID and SGID. 2.2.* and 2.4.* will _only_ remove the 
SGID bit if the file is group executable. This is not Posix compliant 
and it is also a potential security whole (as in my case). So I suggest 
the attached patch against 2.4.26rc1. It will make chown always clear 
the SGID bit, just like 2.6 does.
MfG
