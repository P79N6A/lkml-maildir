Greets everybody;
I have a camera, a Logitech(Sunplus ccd chipset) ClickSmart 310, usb 
interface, that almost works with qcam-vc.  But I just noticed, after 
rebooting to 2.4.22-pre6 earlier today, that the display on the 
camera no longer is reporting 'PC', and that there are some messages 
that look like problems in dmesg.
So my conclusion is that whatever has been adjusted in the usb stuffs, 
has now rendered the camera totally un-reachable.
This would make life difficult as I'm currently in negotiations with 
the Sunplus folks on the left coast trying to get a data sheet on the 
chipset in it so that I might try to write a new driver for these.
