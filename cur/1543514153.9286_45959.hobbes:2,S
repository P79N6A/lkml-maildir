	Hello,
	That big change in memory layout seems to have more implications 
that those discovered at first sight :-), although bttv.c has been fixed
there is some problem in hp-plus.c (line 408) I get lots of:
io mapaddr 0xdc000 not valid at hp-plus.c:408!
although it works perfectly with 2.3.23-pre1. I have tried disabling the
"Reserved memory" in bios (Size: 32k Address: 0xdc000 but I have the same
messages (it doesn't matter if I enable or disable the reserved memory).
