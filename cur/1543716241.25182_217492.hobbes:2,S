And what about put the management of containers outside the kernel. We could for
exemple use a program that will listen file /proc/acct_event and execute a
programs to handle the event like ACPID does. Of course it will need some kernel
modifications but those modifications will be small as process aggregation will
be done outside the kernel. We could also use relayfs to exchange datas between
user program and the kernel.
