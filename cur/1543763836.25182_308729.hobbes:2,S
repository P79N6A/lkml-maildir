Perhaps another solution would be for someone who has received a
supposedly GPLed Linux kernel from, say, SuSE, to contact SuSE and ask
for the source code to things such as
static u32 tg3FwText[(TG3_FW_TEXT_LEN / sizeof(u32)) + 1] = {
	0x00000000, 0x10000003, 0x00000000, 0x0000000d, 0x0000000d, 0x3c1d0800,
	0x37bd3ffc, 0x03a0f021, 0x3c100800, 0x26100000, 0x0e000018, 0x00000000,

	0x0e00021c, 0x00000000, 0x0000000d, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000,
	0x27bdffe0, 0x3c1cc000, 0xafbf0018, 0xaf80680c, 0x0e00004c, 0x241b2105,
	/* ... */
in drivers/net/tg3.c.  (tg3.c does not contain any license information
at all, and therefore falls under the kernel's GPLv2 license, right?)
