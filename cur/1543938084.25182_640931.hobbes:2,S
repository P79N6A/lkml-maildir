Hi all,
   Converting to and from void * for callback functions loses type safety: 
everywhere else we expect the compiler to catch incorrect pointer types 
handed to functions.
   It's pretty simple to create typesafe callback functions using typeof, and 
with a little gcc trickery we can allow both old-style and typesafe callbacks 
to avoid churn on commonly-used routines.
Feedback welcomed,
Rusty.
