Oh, there's stuff for 2.6.27, I'm still working on stablizing it --
but I put it on hold while I tried to clear out my bugzilla backlog.
Trying to stick to a policy of increased testing and removing bugs
before potentially introducing new ones.  It helps that there have
been several additional groups starting to use 9p and hitting corner
cases my testing didn't cover before.
