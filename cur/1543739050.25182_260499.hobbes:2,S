Or maybe this:
#
# Security options
#
# CONFIG_KEYS is not set
CONFIG_SECURITY=y
# CONFIG_SECURITY_NETWORK is not set
CONFIG_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES=m
For me, anything that needs to use setcap/getcap fails if I don't
compile in security capabilities ie. CONFIG_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES=y.
Don't know if this is your problem or not.
