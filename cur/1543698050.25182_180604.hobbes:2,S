Why don't we take the opporunity to make all CHS code configurable out
of the kernel, and define a new, more compact, partition table format
which used LBA exclusively, and allowed more than four partitions in
the main partition table?
I know it sounds pointless to define a new partitioning scheme when
there are so many already in existance, but for dedicated Linux
machines, only being able to define four partitions without resorting
to 'extended' partitions, which store there partitioning data in other
parts of the disk, is a needless limitation.  We could also ensure
that there is sufficient magic in the partition table to make
identifying it easy and reliable.
John.
