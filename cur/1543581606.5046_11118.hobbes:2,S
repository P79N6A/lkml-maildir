	Hi,
	I am running kernel 2.2.17 and my logs are littered with:
"protocol fe11 is buggy, dev eth0." I managed to locate where in the 
source code this line gets printed. However I can't say much more then that.
	Any ideas if this has been fixed? Please cc to my address since I am not 
on the list.
	Justin.
This msg comes from the kernel (as syslog mentions), more precisely from
$(LK_SRC_ROOT)/net/core/dev.c (usually $(LK_SRC_ROOT)=/usr/src/linux) :
       /* More sensible variant. skb->nh should be correctly
          set by sender, so that the second statement is
          just protection against buggy protocols.
       */
       skb2->mac.raw = skb2->data;
       if (skb2->nh.raw < skb2->data || skb2->nh.raw >= skb2->tail) {
               if (net_ratelimit())
                       printk(KERN_DEBUG "protocol %04x is buggy, dev
%s\n", skb2->protocol, dev->name);
               skb2->nh.raw = skb2->data;
               if (dev->hard_header)
                       skb2->nh.raw += dev->hard_header_len;
       }
