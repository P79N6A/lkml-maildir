Yes. The entry point should be saved in dump.elf itself, this can be
done via a user-space tool such as "makedumpfile". Because
"makedumpfile" is also used to exclude free pages from disk image, it
needs a communication method between two kernels (to get backup pages
map or something like that from kernel A). We have talked about this
before.
- Your opinion is to communicate via the purgatory. (But I don't know
how to communicate between kernel A and purgatory).
- Eric's opinion is to communicate between the user space in kernel A
and user space in kernel B.
- My opinion is to communicate between two kernel directly.
I think as a minimal infrastructure patch, we can communicate minimal
information between user space of two kernels. When we have consensus on
this topic, we can use makedumpfile for both excluding free pages and
saving the entry point. Now, we can save the entry point in a separate
file or I can write a simple tool to do this.

Yes. Exactly. But during kexec loading, if the source page is same as
destination page, we need just one page.

Yes. It really works. If we have 4G RAM, the size of dump.elf is 4G -
(memory area used by second kernel), in this example, it is 4G - 16M.
The loading kernel will live in 16M memory, and load dump.elf into all
other memory area.

There is already similar flag in original kexec-tools implementation:
"--args-none". If it is specified, kexec-tools does not prepare command
line and zero page/setup page etc. I think we can just re-use this flag.
And If it is desired an alias is good for me too.

In original kexec-tools, this can be done through:
kexec -l --args-none <resumable-core>
Do you need to define an alias for it?

In current implementation, this can be done through:
kexec --load-jump-back-helper --entry <entry-point>.
I think the new name is good.
