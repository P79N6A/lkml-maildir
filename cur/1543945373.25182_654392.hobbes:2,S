Subject: [PATCH 2/3] WDEV, ath5k, don't return int from bool function
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/15/370

sparse sees int -> bool cast as an error:
hw.c:3754:10: warning: cast truncates bits from constant value (ffffffea becomes 0)
Fix it by converting the rettype to int and check appropriately.
