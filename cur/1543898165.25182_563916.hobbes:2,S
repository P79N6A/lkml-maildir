Sigh ;-)  Thanks for your patience in dealing with this.

This means that the SMCf010 device *did* respond, I think at the
FIR address 0x100.  (I can't figure out the "right" way to print
those resource_size_t things, so I added some casts in the appended
patch.)

But by the time the smsc_ircc2 driver got loaded, the device stopped
responding.  That means something happened in between that messed it up.

Well, the whole problem I'm trying to fix is that we aren't doing
resource allocation correctly.  The BIOS has configured the IR
device to use port 0x100, and then something else came along and
decided to also use port 0x100.
It looks like the something else is the wlags49_h1_cs driver for
the PCMCIA card you have inserted.  Can you temporarily remove that
card and driver and try the patch below?  If the IR device works
without the wlags49_h1_cs driver, then we'll have to look at
wlags49_h1_cs to see whether it's doing something wrong.

[patch] PNP SMCf010 quirk: work around Toshiba Portege 4000 ACPI issues
When we enable the SMCf010 IR device, the Toshiba Portege 4000 BIOS claims
the device is working, but it really isn't configured correctly.  The BIOS
*will* configure it, but only if we call _SRS after (1) reversing the order
of the SIR and FIR I/O port regions and (2) changing the IRQ from active-high
to active-low.
This patch addresses the 2.6.22 regression:
    "no irda0 interface (2.6.21 was OK), smsc does not find chip"
I tested this on a Portege 4000.  The smsc-ircc2 driver correctly detects
the device, and "irattach irda0 -s && irdadump" shows transmitted and
received packets.
