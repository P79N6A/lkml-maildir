Subject: [PATCH -mm 0/5][AIO] - AIO completion signal notification v5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

  Hi,
  Andrew, would you consider including this patchset in -mm for some more
testing. At least patches 1 - 4.
  Patch 5 is the new listio syscall approach from Bharata B Rao which is much
cleaner than overloading sys_io_submit() with a new opcode but maybe needs some
more discussion before being engraved in stone.
  I'm thinking here of having the capability to be notified when m requests
have completed (m <= total_number_of_submitted_requests) as suggested by Ulrich
Drepper.
  Ulrich, is this still something you want? In which case we may need to add
another argument to sys_lio_submit().
  Sébastien.
  This set consists in 5 patches:
	1. rework-compat-sys-io-submit: cleanup the sys_io_submit() compat layer,
	   making it more efficient and laying out the base for the following patches
	2. aio-header-fix-includes: fixes the double inclusion of uio.h in aio.h
	3. export-good_sigevent: move good_sigevent into signal.c and make it
	   non-static
	4. aio-notify-sig: the AIO completion signal notification
	5. listio: adds listio support
  Description are in the individual patches.
  Changes from v4:
	No comments received for v4, so it must be perfect ;-)
	replaced the IOCB_CMD_GROUP listio implementation with Bharata's
	syscall approach which I find much cleaner.
  Changes from v3:
	All changes following comments from Zach Brown and Christoph Hellwig
	- added justification for the compat_sys_io_submit() cleanup
	- more cleanups in compat_sys_io_submit() to put it in line with
	  sys_io_submit()
	- Changed "Export good_sigevent()" patch name to "Make good_sigevent()
	  non-static" to better describe what it does.=20
	- Reworked good_sigevent() to make it more readable.
	- Simplified the use of the SIGEV_* constants in signal notification
	- Take a reference on the target task both for the SIGEV_THREAD_ID and
	  SIGEV_SIGNAL cases.
  Changes from v2:
	- rebased to 2.6.19-rc6-mm2
	- reworked the sys_io_submit() compat layer as suggested by Zach Brown
	- fixed saving of a pointer to a task struct in aio-notify-sig as
	  pointed out by Andrew Morton
  Changes from v1:
	- cleanups suggested by Christoph Hellwig, Badari Pulavarty and
	Zach Brown
	- added listio patch
