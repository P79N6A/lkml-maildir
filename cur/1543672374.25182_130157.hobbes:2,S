I am writing a USB driver for a well-known vendor's USB device which
requires firmware download.  The vendor is considering allowing me
to publish the driver under GPL.  They will _not_ allow me to include
the binary firmware under any conditions.
So I will be loading the firmware from userspace - but the user must
obtain the firmware as a part of a larger application package.
(Complete crap IMO, but what can I do...)
PS:  what would be the preferred place to load the firmware
from, if no option giving the firmware pathname is passed to the 
module at load time?
