Benchmarks are evil.  Sure they are useful at times, but for the most
part they get misused.  IMHO, aim7 is outdated.  The I/O it does it all
very small for today's systems.  It's like poking the system with
hundreds of needles.  You have no idea how the system will react to a
golf club, baseball bat, sledgehammer or a wet noodle.  Sure, some
people really like it and swear by it.  Benchmarking is better done with
an application set in mind and best done with the application set
itself.

Run the applications you really care about.  There is also a good set of
benchmarks, including application specific ones at
http://lbs.sourceforge.net/.
