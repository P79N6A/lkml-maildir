Its still a gcc bug in that case because you can show by static analysis
that no value is assigned into that array which isn't a member of the enum
and also that nobody takes the address of the object in question...
[Ok its a harder one]
I'd say that gcc warning in the case that all the enum values are enumerated
and have returns is a broken warning irrespective of that so I won't "fix" it
because it isn't broken. Its just like various other bogus gcc warnings
