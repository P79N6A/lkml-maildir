No, that's a different problem.
I had to replace my IDE controller to make the BadCRC errors I was
getting go away (the jury's still out on why my machine is hanging
pretty frequently with the new controller; I've made some progress at
figuring that out, and I'll post more to the list when I've got
something definite).
