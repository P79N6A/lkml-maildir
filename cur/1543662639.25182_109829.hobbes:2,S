Everything seems OK here, from a quick swap and tmpfs test.
Is it possible that some application is leaking memory, and that
swapoff causes it to be oom-killed?
Take a careful look at the process listing, see if some process is using a
lot of memory.  Also the contents of /proc/meminfo.  And see if you can work
out what operation is causing this.
Thanks.
