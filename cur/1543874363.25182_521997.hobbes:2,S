Oh, don't get me wrong, this has certainly nothing to do with "not 
trusting" Andrew. It's just that "this is a super-hot path" doesn't really 
help me understand where kmem_cache_free() is so performance sensitive at 
all.

Thanks for the profile. I still wonder where exactly thouse super-hot 
call-sites are...

Agreed. Unless we can get kmem_cache_free() out of those hot paths, of 
course =).
