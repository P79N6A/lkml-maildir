Yes, but I think in this case it's OK.  IS_ERR() already includes an
"unlikely()" marking so gcc *should* be able to do the right thing.
The goto is probably just a remnant from before unlikely() existed.
There are a lot of them - cleaning them up is a good thing.
That said, it'd probably be good to look at the generated assembly in each
case to make sure it still looks good.  That'd be a lot more useful than
trying to benchmark a tiny micro-optimizaiton in open()  It's generally
nearly impossible to benchmark these sorts of things anyway since when
you're running a simple benchmark the whole function will be in Icache and
the branch predictor history so it'll run the same speed either way.
The advantage to keeping the fast-path straight through is that you consume
the minimum number of lines in the Icache and the branch will get predicted
correctly even without history (since the first-level branch prediction
heuristic is always "branches backward are taken, branches forward are not")
