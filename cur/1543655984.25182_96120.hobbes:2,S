You misunderstand. You have an AGP 3.0 bridge.
Various things are done differently to how they were in previous
revisions of the standard. For example, the aperture size is now
a 16 bit field (which is why people are getting that
"can't determine aperture size" error).
I'm working on merging the Intel patches posted here a while
ago, and bending the generic bits into something that *might*
work (I don't have a board to test -- I'll shout when I have
something I want people to test with), note that I'm doing this
for 2.5 however. 2.4 is going to have to wait.

X should start, but you'll get no accelerated 3d.
None of the X drivers _need_ agpgart except for maybe the
i810 with shared memory.
