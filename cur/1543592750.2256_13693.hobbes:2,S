With the help of a number of contributors, Steven Cole and I have
managed to cut the list of undocumented configuration symbols from the
previous 55 to 10.  The three *_NET_SCH_* symbols that didn't appear
in the previous listing have popped up because my cross-referencer was
fooled by some old comments in Configure.help.
Networking:
CONFIG_NET_CLS_POLICE
CONFIG_NET_CLS_TCINDEX
CONFIG_NET_SCH_INGRESS
ARM port:
CONFIG_SA1100_SHERMAN
PPC port:
CONFIG_EST8260
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MPC8xx_IDE
CONFIG_IRQ_ALL_CPUS
CONFIG_USE_MDIO
CRIS port:
CONFIG_ETRAX_FLASH_BUSWIDTH
CONFIG_ETRAX_I2C_USES_PB_NOT_PB_I2C
As before, if you know enough about any of these configuration options to
write a help entry, please send it to me.

You need only reflect that one of the best ways to get yourself 
a reputation as a dangerous citizen these days is to go about 
repeating the very phrases which our founding fathers used in the 
great struggle for independence.
