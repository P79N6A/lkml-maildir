You should check with Linus on that... I think telepathetic [sic] 
powers aren't due in until 3.0. Yep, I'm pretty sure he's holding 
all new psychotic power patches until then. 
However, numerology has been available for a while (/dev/random).
I think Alan is already accepting patches for the 2.3-ac series for 
these issues.
Snip, Snip, cutting the thread... [geek myth reference]
