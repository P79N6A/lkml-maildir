To take the point of view of someone who neither wants containers nor
LSM but just a fast box,
you're asking me to introduce LSM hooks for the !SECURITY case?  :)
I can give it a shot, but I expect some complaints.  Now at least the
_mknod hook shouldn't be a hotpath,  and I suppose I can add yet
an #ifdef inside the !SECURITY version of security_inode_permission().
I still expect some complaints though.  I'll send something soon.
