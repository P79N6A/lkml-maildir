Its very hard to make that assessment when the audio layer still doesnt
work, most scsi drivers havent been ported, most other drivers are full
of 2.4 fixed problems and so on.
Most of my boxes won't even run a 2.5 tree yet. I'm sure its hardly
unique. Middle of November we may begin to find out how solid the core
code actually is, as drivers get fixed up and also in the other
direction as we eliminate numerous crashes caused by "fixed in 2.4" bugs
