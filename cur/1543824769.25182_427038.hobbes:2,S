There *is* no coherent naming scheme.
Also, RPM's and .deb's are not the only package formats out there. You
are forgetting (just to name a few) :
 - Slackware Linux's package format
 - Stampede Linux's package format
 - Arch Linux's package format
and there are more...
Then there are people building custom distros from scratch. And then
there are people like me who's distro does ship a kernel package &&
kernel-source package but who doesn't use them, but instead build &
run custom kernels from kernel.org source tarballs.
Finding a way to detect if people have kernel sources available that
are configured to match the current running kernel that'll work for
everyone is a lost cause - give it up.
Looking in  /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/  and/or
/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/source/ is probably the best you can do (and
doing that makes sense - at least to me)...

Ehh, no.
It's not for the kernel developers to mandate what distributions
install. All we can (and should) require is that they obey the GPL and
make source available according to the terms set forth in the license.
