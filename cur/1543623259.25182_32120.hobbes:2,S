Right, and what we're talking about is going further and requiring that WCE=0
and ordered tag means the data for previous commands is *not* in the buffer,

Yes, that's the idea.  And we need some way of knowing which vendors have
interpreted the scsi spec in the way that maximizes both throughput and
safety.  That's the 'whitelist'.
