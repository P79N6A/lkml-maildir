Subject: unmap_kiobuf frees locked pages

unmap_kiobuf is first freeing the page and then unlocking the page. This
is fine assuming the kiobuf is used to lockdown userspace as done by the
/dev/raw* device driver (so the free_page will never be the last free
page), but if the free_page is going to release the last reference to the
page, a BUG() will correctly trigger.
This is the fix against 2.3.36:

And this is the fix against 2.2.14aa1 (while 2.2.x won't trigger a BUG(),
it may as well race, probably not though, as all is serialized by the
kernel lock in the VM lock/waitqueue handling in 2.2.x).
