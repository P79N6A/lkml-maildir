Hello,
Is anyone using UMSDOS recently enough to verify that it still works? :)
I'm trying to upgrade a 386 with ZipSlack 8.0 to ZipSlack 9.1.
Using the Slackware lowmem kernel, as well as my own 2.4.24 kernel; both
will load init okay, but anything init tries to run (such as
/etc/rc.d/rcS, /sbin/agetty, etc) just fails repeatedly:
INIT: cannot execute "/sbin/agetty"
INIT: cannot execute "/sbin/agetty"
INIT: cannot execute "/sbin/agetty"
INIT: cannot execute "/sbin/agetty"
INIT: cannot execute "/sbin/agetty"
INIT: cannot execute "/sbin/agetty"
INIT: cannot execute "/sbin/agetty"
INIT: cannot execute "/sbin/agetty"
INIT: cannot execute "/sbin/agetty"
INIT: cannot execute "/sbin/agetty"
INIT: cannot execute "/sbin/agetty"
Seems strange that init can be executed but nothing thereafter.  Does
anyone have any ideas what can be done to narrow down what is going on
here?
