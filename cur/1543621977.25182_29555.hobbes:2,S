Er, that's not mine, is it?
My CVS tree has no hacks in the Makefiles, but has GNUmakefiles which look
something like the one below.
The hacking of TOPDIR is for compiling in old kernels without having 
compatibility hacks in the Makefile - in the GNUmakefile I set TOPDIR to a 
directory in which I have a hacked Rules.make which sets M_OBJS from obj-m, 
sets TOPDIR back to OLDTOPDIR and includes the proper $(TOPDIR)/Rules.make.
Making this work with kbuild-2.5 so that I can just check stuff out from my 
CVS tree and type 'make' as I do at the moment is something I haven't tried 
yet.
