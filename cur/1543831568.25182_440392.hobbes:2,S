It's mine. [0], [1], and [2] contain relevant context as well. The above
commit is insufficient as a fix; the current Ubuntu Dapper kernel
(2.6.15-25.43) does not have the patch from [2].
I have been unable to reproduce the hard freeze using Dapper's current
kernel, but others commenting in [0] are able. The patch from [2] only
seems to lessen the frequency of the freezes on certain hardware.
