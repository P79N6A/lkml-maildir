In terms of what you're talking about (unified scheduling of various
different resources in to groups), not as far as I'm aware. There are
existing ways of layering things like regular process scheduling in to
groups (scheduling domains, and other similar examples) but what
you're after is different. Someone will doubtlessly crawl out of the
woodwork with examples which do what you want though :-)
