Duh !
No it can't.  The client fails with another error message though,
which I mistook for a success past the creds point   :(
If I was drunk I *would* use that as an apology.  I'm not yet, but
perhaps it would help.
Sorry all. I'll keep digging, and double check my errors,  Scout's honor  :)
Still, the software works like a charm on 2.2 so whether it's my fault
or not, the change of behaviour is *definitely* kernel related.
