Subject: [2.5.44] Poweroff after warm reboot

Hello,
If I reboot my laptop with kernel 2.5.44 (warm reboot), the machine reboots, 
loads the kernel, and then in the middle of the booting process powers off. 
Doing an actual shutdown (poweroff) results in a clean boot next time.
This behaviour is not present with kernel 2.5.40.
The last message I'm able to see before the screen goes blank is something 
about serial io being detected/loaded.
Is this a known bug?
PC is a Dell Latitude CPI A XT 366. More info available if needed.
