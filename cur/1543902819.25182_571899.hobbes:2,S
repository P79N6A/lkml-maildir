The GCC bug exists on all architectures.  Linux build is only
affected on PowerPC, and only when modules are enabled, as far
as I know.  I have no way to build IA64 kernels right now, someone
else will have to check and create a similar patch if necessary.

For some value of "soon".  Likely this bug will be fixed in 4.2.1,
and if not, I'll just update the range check in here.
