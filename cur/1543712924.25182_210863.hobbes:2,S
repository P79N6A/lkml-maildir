Right, so let's choose the initial balancing policy on a per process
basis.

If the machine is 100% full all the time and all apps demand the same
amount of bandwidth, yes, I want 1 job per node. If the average load is
less than 100% (sometimes only 2-3 jobs are running) then I'd prefer to
spread the processes of a job across the machine. The average bandwidth
per process will be higher. Modern NUMA machines have big bandwidth to
neighboring nodes and not too bad latency penalties for remote accesses.
