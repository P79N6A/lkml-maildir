|  That looks correct.  The company seems to have problems with identity:
|
| # hdparm -i /dev/hda
|
| /dev/hda:
|
|  Model=SunDisk SD35B-64, FwRev=vcb 1.45, SerialNo=MT311213748
|  Config={ HardSect NotMFM Fixed DTR>10Mbs nonMagnetic }
|  RawCHS=490/8/32, TrkSize=0, SectSize=576, ECCbytes=4
|  BuffType=DualPort, BuffSize=1kB, MaxMultSect=1, MultSect=1
|  CurCHS=490/8/32, CurSects=125440, LBA=yes, LBAsects=125440
|  IORDY=no
|  PIO modes: pio0 pio1
|  DMA modes:
|  AdvancedPM=no
|
| (that's a traditional 3.5" ATA flash device).
Yes, the company changed its name (at the urging of Sun IIRC).
