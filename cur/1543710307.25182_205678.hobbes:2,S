OK, thanks.

Am I correct in thinking that this patch provides the necessary hooks to
integrate x86_4 into the new functionality which sched-domains provides, or
is the Intel patch independent of sched-domains?

Yours is the only report of regression of which I am aware.  Is the reason
understood?
And is anyone developing alternative SMT enhancements?
