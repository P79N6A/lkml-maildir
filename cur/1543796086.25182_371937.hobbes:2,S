Subject: [QUESTION] Filesystem like structure in RAM w/o using filesystem (not ramdisk)

Hello!
As I have understood the accessing ramdisk goes through the same kernel 
path which is meant for accessing slow block device (i_nodes caching etc.).
Is there any other common way (some API above shared memory?) to 
create/open/read/write globally accessible hierarchical datablocks in RAM?
Could it be possibly faster than ramdisk?
Thanks in advance,
Indrek
