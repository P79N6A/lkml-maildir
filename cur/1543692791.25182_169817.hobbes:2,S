Subject: [PATCH] [TRIVIAL 10/12] 2.6.0-test6-bk remove reference to modules.txt in net/bridge/netfilter/Kconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/10/1/189

This patch removes the reference to Documentation/modules.txt,
which has been removed.  The patch was made against the current
2.6-bk tree.
This was done slightly differently, maintaining the existing style
in this file.  The other tristate options do not specify the module name.
