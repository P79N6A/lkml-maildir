Not really.  If you want to do something along those lines it would be 
better to add a new open flag called something like O_RDEXONLY which 
would require r-x effective file permissions, and allow 
PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC mmaps (though for that to be really useful, you'd 
need to make an O_RDONLY fd not allow PROT_EXEC mmaps, which would break 
a few things).
access() is just plain racy, and can't be used safely for any kind of 
permission/security check.
