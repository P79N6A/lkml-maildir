So the behavior that Cristoph was objecting to here is in fact
configurable?

No, you need the userspace daemon to set the permissions on the root
directory of the new mount restrictively.  What am I missing?

Root squashing is actually a much less obnoxious restriction.  It means
that local uid 0 doesn't automatically correspond to remote uid 0.

But why does the kernel need to know anything about this?  Why can't
the userspace library present the permissions appropriately to the
kernel?  I'm going to be pretty confused if I see a mode 666 file that
I can't even read.  So will various programs.
Except for the allow_root bits, I think that having userspace handle
the issue entirely would cover both objections.

More or less.
