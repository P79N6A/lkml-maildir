Yes, agreed, the code as it stands is fine.
I'm only warning that several people want the ability to enter another
task's namespace (and other people are squarely against it :), and
if/when we try to implement that again, then simply using
switch_task_namespaces() will not suffice.  The caller will have to grab
an extra reference to the new nsproxy (as you imply, I guess under the
task_lock(target)), call switch_task_namespaces(), then drop the extra
reference.  (Or implement a whole new helper.)
I don't even know whether this warrants a warning or not.  Hopefully
anyone who'll try to implement that will be able to deduce that for
themselves.  But still I usually like to see such things warned against...
