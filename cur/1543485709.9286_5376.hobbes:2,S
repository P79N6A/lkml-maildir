	No, they haven't. kernel_lock affects nothing if the process
doesn't run at this moment. It protects processes on *different* CPUs from
simultaneous running in the kernel. It's an attribute of task and if the
task decides to sleep it is removed (and restored as soon as it wakes up).

	Neither. Imagine the following situation: process A calls fsync()
and sleeps on IO. In the meanwhile process B wakes up and starts messing
with the file. After a while it sleeps on IO too. Process A wakes up and
finds some interesting changes ;-/ And struct file (and to less extent
dcache) management still isn't SMP-safe, so we need kernel_lock hold.
