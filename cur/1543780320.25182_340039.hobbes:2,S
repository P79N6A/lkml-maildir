This is just a guess, without any actual code-reading:
Maybe the C-state decision process just relies on being called every
tick, so "after X ticks with no BM activity, go to next deeper C state".
As long as 1000 ticks per second are coming in, everything is fine and
we enter C[n+1] after X miliseconds without BM activity. Now if there
are only 60-70 ticks per second, you never get X ticks without BM
activity so you never go deeper than C2.
Just a guess.
