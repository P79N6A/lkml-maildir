Paul,
I had a test run of a kernel using Steven's patch (RCU using tasklets) going over the
weekend. It looks like it made it through running racer for 24hrs without a panic,
but I'm not entirely convinced (since my reservation of the test system expired on
Saturday and I didn't look at it until Wednesday; bad Clark, no doughnut).
I've got another test running now and I'll be able to poke around on the system
tomorrow morning to see if in fact there were no RCU related Oops'en. I'll let you
know what we find.
Clark
