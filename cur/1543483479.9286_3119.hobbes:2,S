There are different limits.  We've got a limit for the size of block
devices and a limit given by the structure of ext2.  The latter is given
by the 32bit pointers used in inodese and indirect block pointer blocks
etc.  32bit pointers == 4GiBlocks, 4GiBlocks * blocksize is therefore
the limit.  The common blocksize is 1kb, so the ext2 limit is 4TB.
