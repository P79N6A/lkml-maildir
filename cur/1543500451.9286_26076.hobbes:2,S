If some people actually put some attention on linux-kernel they would
notice that "someone" already said that:
	1. fs changes temporarily broke them all
	2. some fs have been updated (ext2)
	3. the ones that are broken, instead of silently corrupting your
	   partition, on purpose don't compile.

If it is visibily broken, someone will come and fix it.  If an ugly temp
hack is placed until someone fixes it, nobody ever will.

They are discouraged because FAT doesn't compile, but they aren't
discouraged when Linus says that that kernel still might have fs corruption
bugs? ... "doesn't compute! doesn't compute!"
