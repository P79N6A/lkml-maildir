Holy shit - get OVER IT.  You guys are posting shit that is *OLD*
*NEWS*.  This was posted here 6 MONTHS ago, at which time all
this same discussion took place, and everyone ceased and
desisted.  Not only are you rehashing ANCIENT news that doesn't
matter worth a shit to anyone here or really affect anyone's
choise of OS at all, you are quoting PAGES of the previous post
you are responding to - without needing the quote for any context
purposes.
Let this ANCIENT and MEANINGLESS thread DIE allready.  Dead Horse
- beat beat beat...
