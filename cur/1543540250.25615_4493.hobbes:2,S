I found out what was wrong. Turns out someone introduced 
"PS/2 reconnect code" right about that time. This touches both
2.2.x and 2.4.x kernels. I put in a line to report when reconnect
happens - and know what ? - my notebook reported several such events..
So the fix is to remove this code entirely - and then _both_ gpm and
Xserver work. (and no Xserver couldn't decipher bogus data either.
Apparently after each "reconnect" the kernel attempted to reset the mouse
- oh my..).
Now it completely evades me why this was not marked as an "experimental
and dangerous" option, since in most manuals I read PS/2 bus is clearly
marked as not supporting hot-plugging.
The patch is quite simple:

I leave it to the person who needs to hotplug his PS/2 devices so
desperately to introduce an option in kernel configuration to enable his
code.

PS And by the way gpm is maintained again.. I think I am using the June
version.
