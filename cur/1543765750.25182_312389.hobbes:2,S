I'm sorry, I can not catch the point well,
but what I want to say is, we do not want stop the service due to bug fix.
As you said, if we can migrate the data to new process without stopping
service, it is OK, but the real applications need to takeover data very
much(sometimes it's over gigabyte....depends on service, and causes
service disruption...). So, live patching seems reasonable to us.
And unfortunately the APIs which people suggested are all based on
ptrace system calls. as you know, ptrace based data read/write needs to
stop the target process during read/write. We would like to minimize
target process stopping time.

well, it's possibly, but the same problems occur on gdb.
I think this depends on user's manner...
I briefly describe the way of live patching below;
1. Load the patch modules with pannus -l command.
- load the patch module with first memory mapping system call(ptrace
PEEKDATA can be same work, but it needs to stop target process..)
- search patch module's initialize area and execute them with
execinit.c(similler to signal handler)
- target process exec initialization.
2. Activate the patch modules with pannus -a command.
- stop the target process and check current instruction not to conflict.
- if it is not conflict, overwrite the jump assembly to function's
entrypoiny where you want to fix, to patch module's one.
- restart the process.
Will this be answer??
