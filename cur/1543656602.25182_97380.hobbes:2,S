Somebody still has to answer it - loads of mails to LKML go unanswered
because people are spending their time coding instead of reading the
list, (which is good).

How?  I don't see as that is more likely than with Bugzilla.  Anyway,
loads of LKML posts get ignored, and nobody seems to worry about it :-).

The idea is that the bug database does a sanity check on their bug
report.  It still gets entered in to the database, but it would return
something like:
"
Hi,
You submitted a bug to the bug database.  Please note the following:
* You mentioned kernel version foobar.  This appears to be a vendor
kernel, not an official kernel tree.  Your distribution maintainers
might be more appropriate people to contact
* You included an undecoded oops - this is probably useless.  Please
read the FAQ.
Thanks for using the bug database.  Your bug has been assigned to
[whoever].
"
I don't see any way of making Bugzilla do all the things I described
originally, specifically the advanced tracking of versions tested.
That could help to find duplicates, which is a big problem when you
have 1000+ bugs.
John.
