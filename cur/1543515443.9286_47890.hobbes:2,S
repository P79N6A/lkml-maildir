Hi,
  I think that a file name generation rule on VFAT is
different from Windows.
  Long name is not generated when I make 8+3 file name
in capital letters on Windows. But Linux generates it.
This patch does the following revisions.
o  It makes a file name generation rule same as Windows
o  By default, it shows short name in capital letters
o  By "small" option, it shows short name with small letters
o  By "forcelong" option, it always generates long name
