If receiver application can't keep up UDP drops packets. The counter
receive buffer errors (UDP_MIB_RCVBUFERRORS) is incremented.
Don't expect flow control or reliable delivery; it's a datagram service!

Most likely, the user level irq balance daemon (irqbalanced) is adjusting it?

Look at device capabilities with:
	lspci -vv
