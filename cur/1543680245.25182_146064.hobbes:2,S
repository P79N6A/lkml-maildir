Yes, I know :-( I forgot that I modified pgtbl.h too. All these files are 
common to vmmon/vmnet and should be same. update36 large 173887 bytes
should have all needed files updated in vmnet too. If it will not work,
I'll download -mm2 and try really building code, as apparently even
trivial changes are too complicated for me today.
