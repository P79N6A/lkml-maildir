Oh well.. I've got quite used to tweaking rlwinm directly but I suppose
it's more clear for others to go to clrrwi. I see no obvious problem
though I haven't double checked the bit counts, I suppose you got the
substraction right everywhere but you know... it's always on the trivial
things that we make the nasty mistakes ;)
I'll look again when I'm back (I'm away for the week-end)
Ben.
