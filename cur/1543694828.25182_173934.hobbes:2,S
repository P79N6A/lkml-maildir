No, I'm not... I use the vesafb driver. Do you think disabling this could cure 
the Oops?
Btw. a similar Oops at the same place occours when the uhci-hcd module is 
unloaded...
The attached patch prevents the kernel from Oopsing, so it seems some inode 
lists are corrupted (NULL terminated!). Don't know how the FB driver could be 
the reason...
