Clamping to last returned timestamp value would be fine here. Time would go
moderately haywire for a while (lurch forwards and then stop for a while),
but wouldn't go backwards and should recover reasonably within the timescale
of the thermal event itself. I don't see an issue with just implementing
this clamping if it is needed.
