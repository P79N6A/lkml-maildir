Apologies for the terse report,
On my macbook with latest kernels
1. Alsamixer is showing only three controlls in total,
    Master PCM and Digital.
2. There is absolutely no output sound what so ever.
3. There is no capture sound being captured either.
Reverting back the pin config to the one in previous kernels is
working (although not perfect e.g. to enable input sound we need to
toggle the capture device to mic and linein atlease once, no idea
whats the deal with that)
I am willing to do whatever test you people want, though I do not know
where to look for more info at this point. So please feel free direct
me to arrive at a better soultion or better info.
Thanks
Abhijit
