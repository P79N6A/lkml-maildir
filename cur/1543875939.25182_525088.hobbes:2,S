Actually, I believe the number was 640k, the quote included the phrase 
"should be," the available memory on the IBM PC. And this was after IBM 
decided to put the video adapter in memory at 640k, Intel decided to 
provide only 1MB of address space on the 8086, and was in the context of 
mainframes of the day, some of which could only address 1MB.
And having run clients with three users on an XT with just that 640kB 
and UNIX, I don't think he was wrong about the memory for that time, 
just the O/S.
BTW: anyone got a copy of PC/IX (SysIII for XT) around? I'd love to run 
that in a VM just for the comparison.
