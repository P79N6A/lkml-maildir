Some notes:
- if gcc can prove a variable gets used uninitialized it gives
  a different warning
- gcc says it may be used uninitialized - there can always be false
  positives when the correctness of the code is due to some higher
  level logic
- I've seen cases in the kernel where it was technically impossible
  for the compiler to verify a variable always gets initialized
So if we want these warnings we'll always need to silence the ones that 
are verified as being correct code like your patches do - and that's not 
gcc's fault.
