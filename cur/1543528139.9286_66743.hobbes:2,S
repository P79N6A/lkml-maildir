Well, I'm not real sure *what* X is doing, but it evidently expects to
find the w bit set, regardless if it's a link or not.  vc/* is of course
owned by the logged-in user, and set to rw-rw-rw-, so that's not a
problem.  However, I think for the short term (at the very least on my
own box) it would be easier to adjust devfs to create symlinks as
lrwxrwxrwx (instead of lr-xr-xr-x).  Where in the code would I look to
adjust that?  Not looking to submit a patch--just want to get it to work
here, until everyone else decides to use good coding practices.

Linus: 
Can we have the old name system back?  It was really easier to work
with, and to me it was just as expressive.  Or how about this--let's
pick a naming convention and STICK WITH IT!! devfs is stable enough to
be in the stable thread (where's the guy that was backporting to 2.2.x? 
I miss him!), and as such, it's naming convention needs to be solidified
and stabilized.  I want the old names back (by default--not by devfsd),
but if that's not possible, how about some assurance that you're not
going to change the 'standards' again?
(Like he'll ever read this anyhow. Oh, well, that's MHO, anyhow).
