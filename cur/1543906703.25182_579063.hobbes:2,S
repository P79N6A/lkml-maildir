Yes, and the lapic timer apparently worked okay until then, right?
FWIW when you disable it this appears in the boot messages:
Clockevents: could not switch to one-shot mode:<6>Clockevents: could not switch to one-shot mode: lapic is not functional.
Could not switch to high resolution mode on CPU 0
 lapic is not functional.
Could not switch to high resolution mode on CPU 1
Yet "highres=off" does not fix the problem. Very strange...
