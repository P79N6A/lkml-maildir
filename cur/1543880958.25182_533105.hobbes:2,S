Final followup,
If I compile EDAC out of the kernel completely, everything works now.
This should be resolved though.
1) dd.c should produce some kind of warning when it wants to assign a
driver to a device, but it can't because a driver is already assigned to
a device
ie. change:
      if (!dev->driver)
          driver_probe_device(drv, dev);
to:
      if (!dev->driver)
          driver_probe_device(drv, dev);
      else
          printk(KERN_WARNING "__driver_attach (%s): alreay registered
with driver %s\n",
             dev->bus_id, dev->driver->name);
2) Possibly a device should be able to have more than one driver
associated with it - so the AGP driver and EDAC could both use the
device in question here (though this would probably be a sizable change).
Either way, at least I found the culprit :)
PreZ :)
