We do review on different levels.
I for once will look at the Makefile + Kconfig bits and some trivial
CodingStyle issues. Here it will help.
You on the other hand I assume will look at the functionality and overall
design and then for you the full patch is the best way.
Well I could try to do the same as you but that would take me maybe
10 hours or more just to come up with some limited input on the overall design.
So therefore instead of backing out I give inputs on the smaller scale
which I know is less usefull but in the hope that this can be resolved
so when you or others take your time to review at least the majority
of the simple CodingStyle things are fixed so you do not get sidetracked
and can concentrate on the important bits.
The message is quite clear.
For a driver like this do something like:
- Describe the functionality / the problem is solved
- Describe the overall design (maybe as a file in Documentation/?)
- Make a single patch available
- Submit mails in smaller chunks for on-the-list reviews
This will then be useable bot for the "triviality" reviewers like me
and for the "knowledge able" reviewers like you.
