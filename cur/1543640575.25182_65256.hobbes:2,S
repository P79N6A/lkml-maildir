Describe this glitch again? Bear in mind that resolution is a very
different matter than accuracy. Jiffies are not accurate in any
absolute sense, but they are monotonic. And unless you've got
interrupts shut off, even get_cycles can only giving you the time
when it stores the timestamp in the register, which may have little to
do with the time the next instruction that uses it executes.

Bear in mind that most arches won't have this sort of difficulty so in
the bigger picture, this might be overkill. Put a comment next to the
generic function that says "might not be accurate" and when a user of
the interface comes along that actually cares about accuracy, the
situation can be reevaluated.
