Well it doesn't happen on my test machine (UP or SMP).  I tried
various recordsizes.  It's probably related to HZ, memory bandwidth
and the precise timing at which things happen.
The test describes itself thusly:
 *  This test generates a load which simulates a process-loaded system.
 *
 *  The test creates a ring of processes, each connected to its predecessor
 *  and successor by a pipe.  After the ring is created, the parent process
 *  injects some dummy data records into the ring and then joins.  The
 *  processes pass the data records around the ring until they are killed.
 *
It'll be starvation in the CPU scheduler I expect.  For some reason
the ring of piping processes is just never giving a timeslice to
anything else.  Or maybe something to do with the exceptional
wakeup strategy which pipes use.
Don't now, sorry.  One for the kernel/*.c guys.
