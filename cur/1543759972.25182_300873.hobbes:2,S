Umm.. This is already done. For parameters defined with module_param()
you use <paramname>=<value> for modules and
<modulename>.<paramname>=<value> for built-in case.

Why would you want parameters that only work for modules? I'd consider
it a bug, not a feature, when parameter works only when code is
modularized.
