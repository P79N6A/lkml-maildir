Having said that, I've had a .config uploading and analysing facility
since version 1.0.  Infact, the reason I forgot to mention it in my
first E-Mail, is that it is the core around which the whole Kernel Bug
Database operates.  The user uploads their .config, and the database
finds bugs that might be the one you're experiencing.  If so, you add
a separate bug report, an admin collects both bug reports in to one
confirmed bug, and picks out which config options he wants to flag as
causing the confirmed bug.
