Agreed, it is ugly. However I don't like leavng the determination of 
whether the system board will only reboot through BIOS to the end user. 
Whilst using the kernel boot argument "reboot=b" is an alternative, it 
works only _if_ one knows the platform in advance. However our boot media 
(and indeed live-cds generally) are used such that this is not practical.
As for whether rebooting through BIOS by default would solve this matter - 
I don't know. It may break on some machines. Given that EFI may (???) 
replace traditional BIOS in the future is it worth re-engineering this?
