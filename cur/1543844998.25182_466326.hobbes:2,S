Hi,
simillar behavior here, but at different parts. 2.6.18-rc7-mm1 takes way 
longer than 2.6.16-mm1 (the last one working here to boot.
I have delays (seconds!) between: 
intel8x0_measure_ac97_clock: measured 50450 usecs
intel8x0: clocking to 48000
and 
IBM TrackPoint firmware: 0x0e, buttons: 3/3
input: TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint as /devices/platform/i8042/serio0/serio2/input3
I'll try to find out more, however I'm quite busy (and ill...) atm. If Tilman 
hadn't mailed, I wouldn't report either, but it looks I'm not the only one 
with these problem ;-O
BTW: No real debuging enabled here, just sysrq and dmesg buffer size.
regards
Alex
