That is why I kept a big *If* in that sentence. I'm quite new to all
this, and I'm still reading a lot of source code.
If the culprit is in fact seq_file, and seq_file can be improved in a
way that works for everyone (not only kallsyms), then I also agree
that is is the way to go. But hunting this down might prove that the
problem is somewhere else. It is just too soon to draw conclusions.
