Subject: AMD 8131 MSI quirk called too late, bus_flags not inherited ?

Hi Greg,
While looking at the MSI detection, I noticed that the AMD 8131 quirk
(quirk_amd_8131_ioapic) is defined as FINAL and thus executed after the
PCI hierarchy is scanned. So it looks like the bus_flags won't be
inherited at all. If there's a bridge behind the 8131, then the devices
behind this bridge won't see the bus flags and thus might try to enable
MSI anyway.
I tried to change the AMD 8131 quirk to HEADER so that it is executed
during PCI scanning. But, I don't get its message in dmesg anymore. Any
idea?
Thanks,
Brice
