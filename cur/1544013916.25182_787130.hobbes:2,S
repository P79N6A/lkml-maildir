Yes.  That is a deliberate tradeoff in our culture.  It's hardly a 
secret, either.

Well, I think the right thing to do at this stage is to simply compress 
the initramfs with the preferred compression method (and if no 
compression method is provided, with none.)  This can be relatively 
simply done with a script, I think.
At least that way the whole image is compressed using the preferred 
compression format, and since all the relevant compressors have methods 
of dealing reasonably with uncompressable chunks we should be okay.
Doing the "free as you go" thing is definitely something I would like to 
see, as well as supporting initramfs in high memory.  I have looked at 
it a few times, however, it is a nontrivial modification and I haven't 
personally devoted the time to dealing with it.  I really don't think we 
want to entangle this issue with the compression patch.
