Hello
I upgraded my kernel on a Mandrake 9.0 base from 2.4.20 to the new 2.4.21 tonight - built from source patches as I always do; followed by reinstalling the NVidia drivers and ALSA.
But there seems to be a major failure when the computer just stops with no warning. Two scenarios that seem to repeat it include starting Loki's Heretic2 off, and mounting the CDRW drive via WindowMaker dock app. I cannot do anything when this happens; can't hotkey out of X, can't telnet to it from my other networked PC. I have to power down and back up.
It seems to be a few seconds after the trigger that the lock up occurs, and also it starts flashing the keyboard Caps Lock and Scroll Lock LEDs in step at about 1 Hz. I'm sure its trying to tell me something...
Thanks in advance
Dave
