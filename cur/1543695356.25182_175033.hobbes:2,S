In a private email Matthias Andree suggested to try the tmscsim driver,
which is [retty badly broken too. So, the question: what is the future of
these drivers? Are they slowly dying because the hardware is outdated, or
are they going to be fixed? If the latter - what is the status of this
work (if any), and - which of the 2 (or both) drivers should survive?
Thanks
