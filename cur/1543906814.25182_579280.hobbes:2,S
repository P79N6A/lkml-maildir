Subject: [PATCH][RESEND][Trivial] Documentation: sysrq, description of 'h' slightly inaccurate
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

(Resending a patch from 21 May 2007 that never got any response)
Hello,
In Documentation/sysrq.txt, the description of 'h' says that any key not 
listed *above* will generate help. That's obviously not true since all the 
keys listed below 'h' will do what they are described to do, not display 
help. So change the text so that it says that any key not listed in the 
table will generate help, which is what really happens.
