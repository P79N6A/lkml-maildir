Hi,
I notice that you've already had a reply on this (use "make help",
"make allmodconfig" or "make allyesconfig" etc.).
OSDL's PLM does this (make allmodconfig) for each new (2.5) kernel
release and the results are posted at
  
http://www.osdl.org/archive/cherry/stability/
and also in the PLM web page interface.
The script that is used for this is at that same URL above.
PLM is at 
http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm/
 .
Has anyone tried to boot an 'allyesconfig' kernel?
I'll give that a shot now.
HTH.
