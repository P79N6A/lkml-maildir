I'm using the one that comes with "2.6.17-ck1" as the subject suggest :)
Anyway I've just seen this in your git tree:
@@ -2222,6 +2283,7 @@ static int ext3_remount (struct super_bl
[CUT]
        ext3_init_journal_params(sb, sbi->s_journal);
+       if (fcache_devnum) {
+               ext3_close_fcache(sb);
+               ext3_open_fcache(sb, fcache_devnum);
+       }
So I suppose that it's already fixed.
