Yeah, but let's get the normal interface working first and discuss what

That's somewhat of a contradiction in terms.  The whole point of the VFS
is to hold all of the things that multiple filesystems want to  
share :-D.

Personally, I think that the multiple views is a good thing.  I like
being able to "cd /Applications/Games/UnrealTournament2004.app/System"
and mess with my game files, while double-clicking it in the Finder
just starts it so I can get on with owning my friends :-D.

Maybe we just need better regular applications?  I think that for the
icon case, for the Samba/streams case, and for many others I'm probably
forgetting, we should try to come up with a new "data-stream" VFS API,
so that the icon data and other larger quantities can be stored in a
filesystem without much effort.  Such a layer could even be bridged
onto existing filesystems via a VFS-wrapper bind-mount:
# mount -t reiser4 /dev/hda1 /mnt1
# mount -t ext3 /dev/hda2 /mnt2
# cat $(metapath /mnt1/foo)/streams/description
Some random file
# cat $(metapath /mnt2/foo)/streams/description
cat: Unsupported operation
# mount -t none -o bind,streamify /mnt2 /mnt3
# cat $(metapath /mnt3/foo)/streams/description
Another random file
Such a wrapper interface might use the directory '...' to store files on
the underlying filesystem, but I don't think that the meta interface
itself should use those directories.
Cheers,
