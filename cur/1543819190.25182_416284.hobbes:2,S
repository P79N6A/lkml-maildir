While it sounds like a violation concerning the Linux kernel, and
therefore also an issue for the copyright holders here, have you
considered talking to the FSF about this?  Harald Welte and
http://www.gpl-violations.org/
 tend to handle enforcement issues.  I
can't tell whether you are one of the holders, but if you aren't, letters
from you might not do much of anything.  They might also serve to
aggravate the situation, depending upon the tone used.
