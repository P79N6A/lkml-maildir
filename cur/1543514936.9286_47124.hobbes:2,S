Hi,
I hop this isn't inappropriate; it seems like a bug to me.
I added in support for SCSI-IDE emulation to my 2.2.13 configuration,
and now it won't boot any more - it says 'out of memory' when it tries
to uncompress. I did run lilo etc. after recompiling. The bzImage is
only about 650k, and I have a PII/400 with 128Mb, so I should have
thought it
would be ok.
I found an earlier post (
http://lwn.net/lwn/980625/crcfix.html
) which 
suggested changing arch/i386/boot/setup.S; changing a constant in the 
a20_wait loop, from 7c00 to 0. This was in a 2.1 kernel, and the
constant 
is 7c in 2.2.13; I tried changing it to 0, to no avail.

Here's the relevant excerpt from setup.S
! wait until a20 really *is* enabled; it can take a fair amount of
! time on certain systems; Toshiba Tecras are known to have this
! problem.  The memory location used here is the int 0x1f vector,
! which should be safe to use; any *unused* memory location < 0xfff0
! should work here.  
!#define        TEST_ADDR 0x7c
!Hugh's dodgy change
#define         TEST_ADDR 0
        push    ds
        xor     ax,ax                   ! segment 0x0000
        mov     ds,ax
        dec     ax                      ! segment 0xffff (HMA)
        mov     gs,ax
        mov     bx,[TEST_ADDR]          ! we want to restore the value
later
a20_wait:
        inc     ax
        mov     [TEST_ADDR],ax
        seg     gs
        cmp     ax,[TEST_ADDR+0x10]
        je      a20_wait                ! loop until no longer aliased
