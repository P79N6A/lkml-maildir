WCE bit should change then, like ->wcache does for ide. It's handled
inside sd, there's nothing more it can do. sd_shutdown() and
sd_issue_flush() have the same issue, they all rely on ->WCE being
correct.
Can't say I'm too fond of command snooping, but I guess it's the only
solution.

So this would mainly be a problem if you boot with write caching
disabled, but later turn it on. The other way around will still work
safely, at the cost of two noop commands on each write barrier (which I
doubt you would notice).
