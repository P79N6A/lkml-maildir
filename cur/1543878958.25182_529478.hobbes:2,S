My vote would be to instead remove enter_idle() and exit_idle() from
x86-64, just as was done with i386.  Performance monitoring
infrastructure shouldn't be interfering with the idle interrupt
delivery, as that could only hurt performance...  Besides, there's
probably a better way of doing this than an idle notifier anyway.
