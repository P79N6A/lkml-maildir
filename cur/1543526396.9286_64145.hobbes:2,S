Jonathan Corbet (lwn.net) is working with me at updating the book. We
are centering on 2.4, with backward compatibility to 2.2 and 2.0
(although 2.0 support will be missing for some advanced stuff).
We are also going to cover more hardware platforms than x86/sparc/alpha.
I can't tell the schedule for publication (I don't even know).
