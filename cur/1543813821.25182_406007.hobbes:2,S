I agree in general, but why base it on CLONE_SIGHAND? The problem
results from using the same address space.  So it should be
  if (clone_flags & CLONE_VM)
The fact that both these flags are used at the same time in all cases
today shouldn't hide the real reason for this requirement which is
sharing the address space.
