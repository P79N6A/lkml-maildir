Subject: STR with APM possible?

I have ASUS CUSL2 motherboard that supports STR (and it works perfectly
under windows). With the same BIOS settings doing apm --suspend almost
suspends - except that power supply fan continues to run, which
indicates, system is not in STR state.
Kernel is Mandrake cooker 2.4.13-4mdk (based on -ac6), but it was true
for all kernels I've tried starting from 2.2.19
ACPI is not included in mandrake kernels.
Is it supported? Anything I can do to debug/fix it?
TIA
