not a comment but a question which maybe you can answer. I notice that the
vw support included configuring the SMP hardware without an SMP BIOS. I've
been thinking of building on this for linuxbios, i.e. using this code as a
starting point for code that can configure the SMP hardware in the absence
of the SMP bios being there. 
Does this make any sense, or will I need to start from scratch?
