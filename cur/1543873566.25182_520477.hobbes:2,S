Yeah I did go back and check up on that changelog, because I knew
we had a !offset check there at one stage, which is immune to this
problem (or at least can handle it a little better).
I suspect that Miquel was probably more interested in _increasing_
mark_page_accessed coverage with his new condition than restricting
it from the !offset cases.
Thanks for digging it up and posting here, though.
