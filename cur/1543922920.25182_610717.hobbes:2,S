You would pass NODE_MASK_ALL if your intent was to interleave over 
everything you have access to, yes.  Otherwise you can pass whatever you 
want access to and your interleaved nodemask becomes 
mpol_rebind_policy()'s newmask formal (the cpuset's new mems_allowed) 
AND'd with pol->passed_nodemask.
