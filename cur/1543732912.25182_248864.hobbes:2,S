I agree that the interface could be simplified a lot, however I decided to 
make it as generic as possible so that any part of the kernel can use it. I 
also am contemplating whether it would make sense to remove the capability of 
setting the interval to any value, and just have all variables checked every 
WATCH64_INTERVAL.

Agreed. I'm going submit a correction patch.

As far as I can tell, it does. RCU to protect the linked list, and seqlock to 
protect the internal 64-bit counter.
