We recently had such an issue with a dual AMD64 machine rebooting at
mke2fs. It turned out it was a faulty power supply. After we changed
the power supply, everything ran smooth again.
You could start to test by powering your drives from an old AT-style
power supply leaving more "juice" for the main board and CPUs.
