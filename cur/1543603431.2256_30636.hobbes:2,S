I think you can save yourself a lot of pain today by going to a "better
driver"/hardware. Switch to a tulip based board; in particular one which
is based on the 21143 chipset. Compile in hardware traffic control and
save yourself some pain.
The interface was published but so far only the tulip conforms to it.
It can sustain upto about 90% of the wire rate before it starts
dropping. And at those rates you still have plenty of CPU available.
The ingress policer in the traffic control code might also be able to
help, however CPU cycles are already wasted by the time that code is hit;
with NAPI you should be able to push the filtering much lower in the
stack.
