Good luck :-)

Together with the idea of not allowing multiple lines in the kprint_xxx
functions, that would go with our approach having message numbers to
identify a message. Multiple lines are combined explicitly to one
message. I think it is a good idea to be able to identify, which lines
of a message belong together.

Would be nice to have some code here. How do you want to implement that?
You have to allocate / preallocate memory for the argv array. Something
like:
kprint_err(const char* fmt, ...)
{
	va_list   ap;
	struct kprint_message *msg;
	msg = &message_arry[current];
	
	va_start(ap, fmt);
	msg->argv = kmalloc(sizeof(long) * argc, GFP_KERNEL);
	...
	for (i = 0; i < argc, i++) {
		msg->argv[i] = va_arg(ap, long);
	}
If you do it like that, you can't support "%s", since then you would
store only the pointer and not the whole string. I think, that we can't
live without %s.
