It's pretty easy to trigger, actually. Just have some heavy traffic going
in _and_ out, e.g. netcat blowing iso images both ways. It will last a
couple of seconds at most.

As expected. Now comes the punch line: I don't know how to fix this. I
locked my machine up solid a couple of times trying. It seems that
particular flag doesn't want to be cleared. Of course I could simply reset
the chip, but that's a) less than elegant and b) would make cleaning up the
force_media mess kind of urgent. And doing that properly is a rather
non-trivial change. Also, I need to investigate the implications for
Rhine-III and have somebody test Rhine-I.
Thanks for the logs, though; at least now I know that many more would hit
that problem if they weren't using a driver that breaks down way earlier.
If the problem bothers you I can send you a dirty hack. I need to whack
some registers before writing a proper fix, and I don't know when that will
happen.
