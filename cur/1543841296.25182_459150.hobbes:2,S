Don't sell your patch short, it still manages nearly 300 years..

The userspace interface gets broken either way. The error might
actually serve as a decent portability wake up call, solaris 64 bit
also silently overflows in nanosleep, and since I've only had the
opportunity to check on solaris and linux, I wouldn't be surprised if
other OSes had the same problem.
