They're based on the Free Software definition, that establishes the
four freedoms that the GPL was designed to respect and defend.
Each version of the GPL may miss the mark.  But this doesn't mean
that's not their spirit.

Yes.  What's your point?
All I'm trying to show is that the tivoization provision in GPLv3 is
not a departure from the spirit of the GPL.
Is this so hard to understand?
I'm not trying to say why Linus and others chose the GPLv2.
I'm not trying to determine what their motivations were.
I'm not trying to force them to change to GPLv3.
I'm not trying to convince them that tivozation is a bad thing.
I'm only trying to show that anti-tivozation is in line with the
spirit of the GPL.
tivoization, which means to restrict a user's ability to adapt the
software to their own needs and run it for any purpose, while the
hardware manufacturer keeps this to itself, is against the spirit of
the GPL.
Not whatever reasons the Linux developers had to release their code
under GPLv2.  But the spirit that the authors of the GPL tried to
encode in it.
Is this so difficult to accept?

Is the connection with the TiVo network not through some other
carrier too?

As long as this doesn't violate any other laws or agreements they've
entered, that is.  And this includes license agreements.

Didn't mean to, sorry if it seemed that way.  I still don't quite
understand the distinction you're trying to make.

No, the GPL doesn't force anything.  It can't.  All it does is to
demand respect for others' freedoms in case one decides to modify or
distribute the software.  It's only if you do modify or distribute the
software that you must respect others' freedoms.  And TiVo does
distribute the software.  But it doesn't respect the freedoms.
It might as well stop distributing the software.

It's not just that.  They actively stop you from being able to do so.
They do this so as to prevent you from changing the behavior of the
program that runs on that box.  They disrespect the freedoms to adapt
the program and to run it for any purpose.

And, guess what, you *can* do that.  And it's up to the hardware
manufacturer to decide whether they want to use distribute your
software along with the hardware or not.
Whether this would qualify as a Free Software license, and whether it
would be in the spirit of the GPL, is a separate issue.
