Hi Marcelo:

Fairly close, but not complete. You need the two patches at:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=109327862717567&w=2
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=109292095518054&w=2
(You should have them in your mailbox)
After those, there will still be five warnings which I couldn't
find an easy way to deal with:
1. the rio driver:
rio_linux.c: In function `rio_init':
rio_linux.c:1209: warning: use of cast expressions as lvalues is deprecated
rio_linux.c:1333: warning: use of cast expressions as lvalues is deprecated
2. isdn/eicon:
eicon_idi.c: In function `idi_faxdata_send':
eicon_idi.c:2057: warning: use of cast expressions as lvalues is deprecated
3. scsi/53c7,8xx.c:
53c7,8xx.c: In function `NCR53c7xx_queue_command':
53c7,8xx.c:3929: warning: use of cast expressions as lvalues is deprecated
4. rivafb:
accel.c: In function `fbcon_riva_writechr':
accel.c:157: warning: use of cast expressions as lvalues is deprecated
5. affs/super.c :
super.c: In function `parse_options':
super.c:133: warning: use of conditional expressions as lvalues is 
deprecated
As you know these are warnings in gcc3.4 but will be failures in 3.5.
Another thing is in scsi/ultrastor.c:
ultrastor.c: In function `ultrastor_queuecommand':
ultrastor.c:301: warning: matching constraint does not allow a register
ultrastor.c:301: warning: matching constraint does not allow a register
I'm no asm guy so I don't know how serious/how to fix this.
Regards,
Ozkan.
