Why won't it?

How about the aspects of /proc files that are outside of your driver's
control...
 1. The actual size of the /proc file is controlled by a variable that
    your driver sets. Your driver gets no indication whatsoever as to
    when that variable is read.
 2. Your driver is required to recreate the ENTIRE /proc file every
    time a read() call is made, and gets NO indication as to which
    part of the file is actually returned to the caller.
Compare these to the requirements of a character device...
 1. There is no actual size stored anywhere - and, as a matter of fact,
    the whole concept of file size is meaningless.
 2. When your driver gets a read() call, it is only required to return
    data that has never before been returned, and not data that has
    been previously read. Indeed, it is an error to return the same
    data twice.
...and the differences you've overlooked become obvious, as does the
reason why your choice of a /proc file is not appropriate for your
stated application.

You forgot the above.

An obvious source of relevant information is the klogd kernel log tool,
which already does precicely what you're proposing to do. Indeed, I'd
tend to replace your entire logging module with calls to printk() that
specify a unique logging facility.
Best wishes from Riley.
