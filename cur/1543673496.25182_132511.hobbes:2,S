Why are we still dorking around with device TCQ.
There are three holes in the state machine.
IBM's design (goat-screw) is lamer than a duck.
Maxtor thought about redoing TCQ, to not leave the host in a daze but
dropped the ball.
Nobody cares about a broken pile of crap in the NCITS standard, otherwise
the rest of the drive vendors would have adopted.
Stop with drive side crappola and make it host side for SATA.
If you want TCQ go use another OS, and kiss your data good bye.
Not a single OS (linux included) can deal with a error in flush cache, 
much less an error from a previous tagged request.
Don't do it, and if you do, don't bitch.
Cheers,
