More precisely (I think), reading cpu_online_map with preemption
disabled guarantees that none of the cpus in the map will go offline
-- it does not prevent an online operation in progress (but most code
only cares about the former case).  Also note that __stop_machine_run
is used only to offline a cpu.
The cpucontrol semaphore does not only protect cpu_online_map and
cpu_present_map, but also serializes cpu hotplug operations, so that
only one may be in progress at a time.
I've been mulling over submitting a Documentation/cpuhotplug.txt,
sounds like there's sufficient demand...
