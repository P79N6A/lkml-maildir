The page cache contains the process pages, among other things, so it can't all 
be discarded with impunity. You're right in suggesting that discarding them 
and then prefetching them would be a potential alternative, but it would 
actually be more complicated: you'd still have to remember which pages you 
wanted to fault back in, and some how store that info in the image. You'd 
also have to add code to do the faulting.  Right now, we don't (for the most 
part) care what a page is used for - we just save and reload it. I believe 
both implementations give you the option to set a soft upper limit on the 
size of the image, so you can still throw away cache if you want to.

It's not quite unmounting, but Suspend2 already freezes bdevs as part of the 
process of quiescing the system. This was the only way I could find to make 
XFS really complete pending I/O (and stop further submissions).
