If I understand you correctly you have run into SMB oplocks.
See samba manual for oplocks (opportunistic locks). Unless you explicitly tell
that a share does not have them the client shall always cache and nothing shall
be updated until client unmounts or runs out of RAM and has to flush
buffers. 
As a result you should not write to stuff exported via SMBfs locally or via
another network filesystem unless you have forbidden client side cache. Same
stands for reading. At best you will get incorrect data. At worst (in the write
case) the clients may even crash.
Have a look at the samba docs...
