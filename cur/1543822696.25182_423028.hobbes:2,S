Imported .config from 2.6.16.1
ran "make" to prompt for fill in new values
Found it automatically set on USB storage driver, some sound driver,
and "Video for Linux".
Possibly also the parallel port, or maybe that was already on.
Didn't prompt for any of these
Noticed after kernel was some 500k larger than expected.
