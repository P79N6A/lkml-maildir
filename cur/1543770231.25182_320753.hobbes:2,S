Ironically once I work around that it fails with:
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.init.text+0xfe4): In function `sys_set_thread_area':
arch/i386/kernel/process.c:869: undefined reference to `acpi_read_root_resources'
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x1fa3d): In function `acpi_pci_root_add':
drivers/acpi/pci_root.c:275: undefined reference to `pci_acpi_scan_root'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
instead. Oh well. bedtime.
