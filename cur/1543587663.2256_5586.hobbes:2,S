C News did this, actually: if creat(.../name/Y+1) fails, it tries
creat(.../name/Y+2), etc. (IIRC up to 1000 times). This does not really
hurt a fast path: either you do
  sprintf(a, "...", artno);
  if (creat(a, ...)<0) {
    syslog(...);
    return FAILED;
  }
or
  while (sprintf(a, "...", artno),
         creat(a, ...)<0) {
    ++artno;
    if (++count>MAX) {
      syslog(...);
      return FAILED;
    }
  }
it's just one compare in the fast path which you need anyway.
(Initializing the counter does not _have_ to happen for each article.)
What would hurt is a stat() here, but that is not necessary. It could
be necessary in expire and/or maintenance tools, but these are not as
time-critical. The all-numerics mess up things like "find the lowest
article number" (makeactive/renumber/however it is called), in these
cases a stat is really necessary.
However I think the point is moot because the traditional spool layout
has been proven by experience to be inadequate for the job, even in
the face of more sophisticated filesystems - modern news systems need
other storage mechanisms to cope with the load anyway.

INN needs a "storage manager grep", but that's even more off topic
here :-)
