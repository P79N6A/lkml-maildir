Hi Justin,
Stephen informed me privately that aic7xxx_old works for him.
About the aic7xxx update, well, I believe aic7xxx 6.2.36 is pretty stable
(I dont remember seeing any reliable bug report and I also cant find one
in lkml archives) except this one (and a pair of "lockup on initialization
with SMP").
What bugs are you aware of in 2.4's aic7xxx ?
