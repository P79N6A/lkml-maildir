Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/6/107

For some reason the unusual_devs.h entry for Sony Ericsson P990i had
three identical copies in a wrong place in the file in addition to the
correct entry.
