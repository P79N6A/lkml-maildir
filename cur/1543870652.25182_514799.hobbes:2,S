Real hardware running linux.

Well, with a "clockevent" patch of our own. We'd like to use a stock
kernel, though.

I'm afraid you didn't quite understand what I was getting at. Say the
user programs the frequency to be 109,000 Hz. That means a nominal clock
interval of ~9174.3119 ns. Now the clockevent interface forces me to
round it down to 9174 ns. That means the clock interrupts fall behind
with respect to the other parts in the system that implement 109,000 Hz
much more to the letter. The error grows by 34 µs every second so that
after 8 hours, we are lagging by a whole second.
