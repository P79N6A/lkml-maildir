Dear Sir Molnar,

This is going GREAT!
While I'm still writing this very lines (via some webmail client on
konqui), my dreaded P4/HT box is pumping hard along jackd -R -p 128 -n2,
for more than one hour now, with two qsynth/fluidsynth instances up,
ardour continuous 8-track in loop-streaming playback nonstop, and also
some more juk and artsd (kde 3.3 here) all trashing my-full-head-of-sound
in my phones. No xrun, NO lockup, NO nothing. And still counting...
I even have CONFIG_SCHED_SMT set, as you can check by attached config
file. Amazing, to say the least, if you remember my latest complaints ;)
Ingo, you're a champ!
Gotta go to sleep now, it was worth the effort staying awake this late...
tomorrow is a nother day :)
