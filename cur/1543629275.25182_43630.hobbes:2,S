It's possible that the mptable is wrong. Windows uses ACPI to find
the IO-APIC, so the mptable is often not well tested. It may help
to change the MP support in the BIOS setup from 1.4 to 1.1.

The MP table contains physical addresses. Linux kernel uses virtual 
addresses. The physical addresses are mapped to the fixed virtual
addresses in init_apic_mappings().
