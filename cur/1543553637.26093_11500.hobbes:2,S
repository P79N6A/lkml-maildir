Perhaps you mean before? Otherwise you've lost me.

Is this because active audio sources other than /dev/dsp writers are
suddenly in and out of the mix? If there's nothing on the inputs, it
shouldn't matter whether you're changing the levels.
The right way to do this (according to any sound engineer) is to
initialize all the levels to zero unless told otherwise. This would
doubtless annoy the average user, but is more or less equivalent to not
forwarding packets by default.
