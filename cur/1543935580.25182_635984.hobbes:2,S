The string handling in here has become a bit scruffy.
afacit the `namebuf[KSYM_NAME_LEN - 1] = 0;' would be unneeded if we were
to use strlcpy() and I suspect the `namebuf[0] = 0;' isn't needed either. 
And the use of strlcpy() means we don't need to subtract 1 from
KSYM_NAME_LEN and we don't need to fret about weird strncpy semantics when
the input string is too large.
And the fact that incoming arg `namebuf' MUST point at a
KSYM_NAME_LEN-sized buffer could be better communicated by using a
dedicated struct for this, or by giving the arg a type of `char
namebuf[KSYM_NAME_LEN]'.  Or by adding a comment. Or by just ignoring
me and doing something more useful.
