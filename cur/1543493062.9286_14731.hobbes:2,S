Hi,
	i've got to get into serial computone multi-port module driver. I'm 
used to OpenBSD code primary so i'm not sure for some points. The problem with
that drivers is that it feezes the kernel so you get into exit() with a :
"Killing interrupt handler". This happens when the server is sending a lot of
packets to the serial terminal and that the terminal sends ^C characters.
	I tought it was a kind of overflow or a bad control of the drivers. But
now im not sure if it's not the kernel that catch the codes, and call kill_pg()
wrongly.
	Can someone give me some hints please ?
	-Thanks
