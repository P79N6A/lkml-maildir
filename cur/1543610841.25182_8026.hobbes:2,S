On a machine with multiple interfaces, is it possible to set the default
outgoing IP address to something other than the address for the interface
on the outgoing route?
For instance, a machine acts as a gateway, with addresses A and B, where A
faces the world (but isn't in DNS) and B is the canonical address.
Outgoing connections from the machine should appear to come from B.
