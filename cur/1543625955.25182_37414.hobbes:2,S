You can use dri with your 7500?  Same processor as 8500 cards?
If so, which X sources are you using?
I bought an 8500 Evil Master II specifically because I saw Radeon
support in the kernel and X source.  Much to my chagrin, I can't
use dri because the source (4.2.0) says dri is not yet implimented
for that processor.
