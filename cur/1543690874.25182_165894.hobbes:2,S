News flash, This just in!  XMission is an ISP and Eric Biederman
does not work for them

Eric Biederman, myself, and pretty much anybody around here that
wants a decent always-up internet connection run by folks with a
clue uses them.  They do not sell "support contracts".  As with
any company, they support their customers and nobody else.  And
their support is excellent.  Want to learn to install Linux?
They'll even show you how

If you expect companies to support non-customers I have some fine
ocean-front property in New Mexico to sell you.
