I know this...maybe I am not being clear.  I realize -Os is a derivate
of -O2, but is it not an interesting note if -Os can be as fast (or
faster) than -O2 and still generate smaller binaries?  That is my point.
If -Os is equivalent in speed to -O2 but also generates smaller objects,
then why have -O2?  If it does not generate smaller objects (which is
what my testing has shown) then it is worthless.  Unless it is faster
than -O2, like Alan said, in which case then the two options need to
rethink themselves ;-)
