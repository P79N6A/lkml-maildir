You don't need dummy ethN:N interfaces.  Use the iproute2 tools, 'ip' 
specifically.
ip link set eth0 down
ip address flush eth0
ip address add 1.2.3.4/24 brd + dev eth0
ip address add 1.2.3.5/25 brd + dev eth0
ip address add ....to your heart's content
ip link set eth0 up
ip route add default via 2.3.8.9 via 5.4.3.2 dev eth0
See the scripts on 
http://blue-labs.org/
 for some examples.
