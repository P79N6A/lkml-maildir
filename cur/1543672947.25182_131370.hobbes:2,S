One suggestion: ext3 is a journalled version of ext2, so if you can
boot with whatever is needed to specify that the boot partition is
to be mounted as ext2 rather than ext3, you can isolate the journal
system: If the problem's still there in ext2 then the journal is
not involved, but if the problem vanishes there, it's something to
do with the journal.
I have to admit that the above sounds very much like the details
are being recorded in the journal, but the journal isn't being
played back to update the actual files.
Best wishes from Riley.
