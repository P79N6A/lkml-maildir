What would be interesting is various benchmarks against all three.
1) no mutex spinning.
2) get_task_struct() implementation.
3) spin_or_sched implementation.
I believe that 2 happens to be the easiest to understand. No need to know 
about the behavior of freed objects. If we see no or negligible 
improvement between 2 and 3 on any benchmark, then I say we stick with 2.
