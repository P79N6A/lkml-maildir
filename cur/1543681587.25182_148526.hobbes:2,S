You're messages seems to have been cut. I should have sent the following

If I'm reading the lspci output correctly the patch won't have any effect
on my machine because the m5229 interface is at rev 0x20, so the test in
the if block will succeed and the atapi_dma variable is set to 1 just
like it is currently. I'll still recompile and try if you like; let me
know.
