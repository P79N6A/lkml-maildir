Going through a kernel buffer will simply double the overhead.  Let's 
suppose it should not be a big enough issue to stop the patch from being 
merged though (and it looks cleaner that way). However I'd like for the 
WARN_ON((unsigned long)frame & 7) to remain as both the kernel and user 
buffers should be 64-bit aligned.

I don't see how standard COW could not happen.  The only difference with 
a true write fault as if we used put_user() is that we bypassed the data 
abort vector and the code to get the FAR value.  Or am I missing 
something?
