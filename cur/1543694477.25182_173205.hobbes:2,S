Hi Bart,
Funny you should send this as I was just looking at it. The good news is that
it works!. We're not seeing any failed commands during boot anymore. I tested
it on both 2.4.23-pre7 and 2.6.0-test7.
Also, the previous problem we had where Linux would enable DMA on a device
(system) not supporting it has also been fixed now that we look at the dma_stat
bits to determine whether the BIOS indicated DMA. We're currently making sure
that all of our servers does proper BIOS IDE setup to make things work as expected.
Thanks for the patch, please include it.
Torben
