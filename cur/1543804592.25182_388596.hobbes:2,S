That's kind of neat :)
The only other thing I can think of is to do something like
#define task_str(tsk) tsk->container_id, tsk->pid
or
#define task_str(tsk) tsk->container_id, ":", tsk->pid
and have it be used as
printk(KERN_XXX "%s::%s\n", task_str(tsk));
or
printk(KERN_XXX "%s%s%s\n", task_str(tsk));
The only reason I point it out is that we don't risk memory corruption
if the printk caller forgets to give the extra '%s's, like we do if
the caller forgets they need char buf[PID_CONTAINER_MAXLENGTH] instead
of 'char *buf;' or 'char buf;'.
