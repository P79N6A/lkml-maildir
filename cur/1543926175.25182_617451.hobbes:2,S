Subject: [PATCH] libata-scsi:  be tolerant of 12-byte ATAPI commands in 16-byte CDBs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Sebastian Kemper reported that issuing CD/DVD commands under libata
is not fully compatible with ide-scsi.  In particular, the GPCMD_SET_STREAMING
was being rejected at the host level in some instances.
The reason is that libata-scsi insists upon the cmd_len field exactly matching
the SCSI opcode being issued, whereas ide-scsi tolerates 12-byte commands
contained within a 16-byte (cmd_len) CDB.
There doesn't seem to be a good reason for us to not be compatible there,
so here is a patch to fix libata-scsi to permit SCSI opcodes so long as
they fit within whatever size CDB is provided.

Patch is against 2.6.24-rc2-git4.
Sebastian, could you please re-test with this patch
and let us know that it works for you (or not).
