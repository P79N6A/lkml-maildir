I'm sure that's what it says on the largest chip on the PCI card.  It 
could be that the other two chips are more relevant... the numbers from 
them are included below.
I've posted up a quick text only page with the diagnostic information 
from the system (full dmesg, lspci, etc) plus links to pictures of the 
board (since others might see something important that I'm not aware 
of).  You can access that at 
http://pcburn.com/files/Syba_serial_controller/index.html
One chip has "ITE IT8871F 0641-AYS ZF1M04L" written on it, and the other 
two have  a stylized celtic knot looking "T" followed by "TG16C554CJG 
FTA6M-001 0620-B".
