Jens,
You are just jealous because you can't take peyote. Next time your are 
in Utah visiting Novell, come by Lindon at
the old keylabs building -- I'm on the second floor. I am right next 
door to SCO (you can throw a rock and hit darls window from the parking 
lot).
I don't ever talk to them and we have nothing to do with them.
Jeff
