Good.  It sound like we are pretty much back on the same page then.

Ok I missed a piece in your patch.  You have crashdumpk_res, and
crashbackup_start, crashbackup_end.   And I missed the fact that
they were different variables as they dealt with the same concept.
So that patch actually should have been three patches.  The
one line bug fix.  The crashdumpk_res bit (which I strongly
object to) and the crashbackup_start/_end bit.  The fact
that all three were in the same patch is a reviewing and maintenance
pain.
Please in the future do not include code that runs in the primary
kernel and crashdump specific code that runs in the capture kernel in
the same patch.

There are a lot of choices at that point.
Place the data in the on the kernel command line, and pick
it up from /proc/cmdline.
Place the data in a file on the initramfs.
Place the data in a user space data segment.

Cool.
One of the ideas worth exploring is to see about stabilizing the
other side of this interface as well.   That is we should explore
providing a fixed interface coming out of purgatory.ro to the new
kernel and it's user space (i.e. the ELF header like thing).  I think
we are quite close to that point already.  And this goes back to your
question of how do we let the capture kernel/user space know where to
look.
