Hi,
I am trying to install 2.2.2 on an AcerNote 970 notebook.
This notebook has a ps2-mouse compatible touch pad build-in.
When trying to access the touch-pad as /dev/psaux I get:
/dev/mouse: Operation not supported by device
With linux-2.0.X and linux-2.1.131 (latest pre-2.2 snapshot, I tried on
this notebook) accessing this touch-pad as /dev/psaux with gpm and X had
worked - now it doesn't.
Any hints appreciated,
Ralf
