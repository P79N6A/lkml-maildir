That diff doesn't update ./MAINTAINERS
Please prepare a nice changelog describing the architecture (what's an
avr?), who supports it, useful web pages, how to build cross-tools, etc. 
The sort of things which Linus and kernel developers should know when
someone sends in a half-megabyte patch.
And a signed-off-by:, as per section 11 of Documentation/SubmittingPatches.
Thanks.
