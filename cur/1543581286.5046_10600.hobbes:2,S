Of all the fields in /proc/cpuinfo, which ones aren't fixed (as long as
you keep the same processor)?
According to the HOWTO I know bogomips can change.
What about flags/features? Can things be done to a CPU to change the
flags?
Is cpu MHz a real measurement of the speed the CPU is running, or is it
a fixed number that is dependent on the CPU type?
