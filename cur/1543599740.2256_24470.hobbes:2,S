Now I think of it, I suppose
    unsafe_min_or_max_at_line_##__LINE__()
will definitely evoke a meaningful link error.
I still suspect that illegal assembler will do the job, since it must
be treated after gcc has produced assembler itself and line references
must still be present then for the assembler to be able to give meaningful
error messages (;), but assembler is not something I write, so someone
else needs to say.
