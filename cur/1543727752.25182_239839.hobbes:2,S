I just had to reboot, after about an 8 hour uptime with the 'one 
liner' only on top of 2.6.8-rc3.  Out of memory basicly.  tvtime and 
mozilla were casualties of what must be the Oom killer.  Nothing in 
the logs.  I had seti@home, X, kde3.3-beta2, and its kmail, plus top, 
tail, tvtime and mozilla.  Moz died first, or at least thats what I 
noticed first.
