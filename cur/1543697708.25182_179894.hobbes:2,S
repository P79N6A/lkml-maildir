Compiling ffb_drv.c into the kernel (CONFIG_DRM_FFB=y) fails with
ffb_drv.c:386: error: redefinition of `ffb_options'
drm_drv.h:138: error: `ffb_options' previously defined here
Compiling it as a module (CONFIG_DRM_FFB=m) works fine.
I think this was introduced by
ChangeSet 1.1063.39.5 2003/09/01 17:05:39 m.c.p@wolk-project.de
   [PATCH] Update DRI/DRM so XFree v4.3.0 and above works
when all drivers in drivers/char/drm/ except ffb*.* were modified.
Removing DRM(options) (that generates ffb_options) from ffb_drv.c makes 
it compile again. But ffb still needs the cleanup performed on the other 
drivers and possibly XFree 4.3 fixes.
