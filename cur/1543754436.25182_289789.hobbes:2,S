Yes.
Any xrun is pretty much guaranteed to blow the next audio cycle or
two.  Several together tend to "snowball" into a "avalanche".  Hitting
your CPU limit practically guaranteed that kind of realtime disaster.
If you grep your log file for 'client failure:', you'll probably find
that JACK has reacted to the deteriorating situation by shutting down
some of its clients.  The number of 'client failure:' messages is
*not* the number of clients shut down, there is some repetition (not
sure why).  This will give the actual number...
  $ grep '^client failure:' ${LOGFILE} | cut -f4 -d' ' | sort -u | wc -l
It would help if the test script reported this value.
In extreme cases like the following example, eleven of the twenty
clients were shut down by the JACK server.  You can see that clearly
in the blue line (DSP load) of the graph...

Will do.  I appreciate your efforts, and want to see them reach a
working point of closure.  
Though I'm somewhat swamped today, I'll run it as soon as I can.
