Maybe because they consider that there is not only one way to do
things... ;-)
OK, you don't like mine, no problem. I'm just expecting this 
functionnality in the kernel, not MY solution.
On a technical basis, I prefer to have a solution that is using
full compression from gzip rather than relying on a set of keyword
that will need to be updated with kernel dev and growth.
But, I'm second...
Regards,
Paul
