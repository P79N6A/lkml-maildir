I should have read this more carefully :(
config REISER4_FS_SYSCALL
        bool "Enable reiser4 system call"
        depends on REISER4_FS
        default n
        ---help---
      Adds sys_reiser4() syscall.
      This code is not in good shape yet and may not compile and stuff like that.
Without REISER4_FS_SYSCALL, -test4 with reiser4 compiles fine.  Sorry about the noise.
