A rogue driver can always do this by writing straight to the
interface.  I think a more serious issue is: what about a *buggy*
drivers?  However, what I am a bit unclear of is the following: will
this patch prevent me from writing a driver which issues legitimate
vendor-specific commands to control vendor-specific aspects of a
particular piece of hardware?  If so, that would be a very bad thing.
However, if this patch is there to prevent buggy programs from issuing
known-to-be-damaging commands by accient, then that is a Good
Thing[TM].
I personally would have to agree with the people that say this isn't a
security issue, but I *do* believe that protecting buggy programs (we
never have any of those, right?) from causing permanent damage to the
hardware is a very useful thing.
