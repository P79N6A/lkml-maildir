Just as a point of info; i have had these lockup
probs too.  Have a MSI K7N2 with nVidia TNT2
vidcard.  Using kernel 2.6.0-test9.
When i run mldonkey (file sharing) the box will
lock up solid after a random amount of time in
X no matter what combo of ACPI / no ACPI, PIO / UDMA.
Sometimes the mouse pointer keeps moving for up
to ~30 sec before it too freezes.  During this
interval there's no ATA activity and i can reboot
the box with SysReq key combos.  If i wait until
the mouse freezes then the box is completely
locked and the SysReq keys don't work anymore.
HOWEVER, if i adjust the process priority of
mldonkey to -20, then the box doesn't lock up
anymore with ACPI and local APIC enabled and will
keep running forever and even burn DVD or CD's
while playing a video rip while compiling something.
There's the sporatic ~1 sec freeze when mldonkey
grabs the whole CPU but it always comes back.
regards,
