I don't think that triggers on correctable errors, and I'm
not certain how useful the information reported it.  But it
should be at least as good as an NMI :)
Truthfully it really isn't just server chipsets that are interesting
either.  Anything that supports ECC or parity on memory is
interesting.

We do this for every memory controller EDAC supports, so yes
we know how to implement this.  Merging the non-controversial
bits is coming.  But it is certainly a goal to take the
best of the mce code and the EDAC code to generate a good
k8 driver.
Motherboard specific knowledge is really not required.  All that 
is really required is memory controller specific knowledge.  With that
you can decode to the chip select level on most memory controllers.
Then you need just a little extra code (probably in user space) to map
the chip select to which dimm socket they go to on the motherboard.
The memory controller knowledge pretty much needs to be a
kernel driver because reading the memory controller registers 
can be a non-trivial exercise at times.  At least one piece of
Intel seems to like recommending that BIOS developers turn off the PCI
device that has the registers.

The implementation clearly should be architecture specific, and
it will take more feeling out before any work can be done
to even think about unify the interfaces.
Right now the goal is to simply get what has proven useful in the
real world merged.
Currently I do not see implementation problems but I do see
facilities not being as useful as they could be.  Getting little
things like decoding to the dimm sorted out removes hours of
work figuring out which dimm has problems.
I also see a large number of errors that the hardware can detect
that are going unreported because the code just isn't there.  There
are all kinds of bus errors that chipsets can report that are
just being ignored.
So now you know some of the hopes and dreams behind some of the EDAC
code and some more of the model.  Hopefully this will lead to productive
conversations as the code is merged.
