I have the ASUS K8N-VM CSM here(different variant), and it works "fine" 
with the forcedeth driver.  Throughput is fairly slow though, I average 
only about 25 meg/second with scp, on an Athlon64 3700+ talking to a dual 
opteron 265.
Also, jumbo frames are apparently not supported.
I may add on a pci-e network card at some point.
