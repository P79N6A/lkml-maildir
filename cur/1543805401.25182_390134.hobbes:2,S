OK, Jakub, how would you like the system call to look? :-)
It looks like the mincore() system call has reserved bits
available in the output vector.
It's just vfprintf? Not vsprintf too? I'll take a guess that the
performance hit was considered tolerable only if doing IO
anyway. A proper system call would help both cases.
It's bad enough that procps has to suffer the overhead of
parsing all that nasty text. The thought of every app doing
that, automatically via gcc+glibc, is truly horrifying.
