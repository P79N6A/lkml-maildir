Thanks. But i guess it would be still a good idea to turn
ia "check that there is no cpuset" test into an inline
so that it can be done without a function call. Only when
it fails call the out of line cpuset full checking function.
This would make the common case of a kernel with cpuset
compiled in but nobody using it faster.
This could be done even without any memory barriers of
any kind.
