Call me idiot too but please explain what is wrong here:
# cat /etc/lilo.conf
boot = /dev/hda
timeout = 150
vga = 4
ramdisk = 0
lba32
append = "hdc=scsi"

  table = /dev/hda
# fdisk -l /dev/hda

Is anybody able to explain the error?
That partition contains a valid VFAT partition with win98se installed on it (and it works fine,
ofc if I remove lilo from MBR).
