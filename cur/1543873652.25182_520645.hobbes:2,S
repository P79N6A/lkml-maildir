AFAIK, "main" thread's stack is marked as VM_GROWS?? and its size can be
changed dynamically. "other" threads' stack are alloced by mmap (or malloc maybe)
and it never grows. This is difference between multi-thread and single thread.
So, you should be carefull to the size of stack when you use multi-threaded apps
and vm_overcommit_ratio at the same time. Because MAP_NORESERVE is accounted
if sysctl_overcommit_memory == OVERCOMMIT_NEVER, a program like java will fail
to create a new thread sometimes.
I have no good idea to fix this difference, sorry.
