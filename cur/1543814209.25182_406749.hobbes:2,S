If it indeed doesn't, then it's a bug in GCC. GCC shouldn't throw
away volatile accesses. I've already quoted the GCC manual for you:
" Less obvious expressions are where something which looks like an access
is used in a void context.  An example would be,
     volatile int *src = SOMEVALUE;
     *src;
 With C, such expressions are rvalues, and as rvalues cause a read of
the object, GCC interprets this as a read of the volatile being pointed
to. "
