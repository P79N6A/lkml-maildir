Did that, got lots of output, but the oops isn't reproducible
AFAIK, so I haven't collected all of that debug output.

The .config file, gcc -v output, and /proc/cpuinfo are added as
attachments at
  
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=432
objdump disassembly and make fs/ntfs/inode.s files are also
attached there.
I tried to decode the disassembly, got lots of it done,
but I bogged down on something that may be outside of the
NTFS realm.  I have ALL kernel hacking options enabled
(=y), and it's a bit hairy (for me) to decode all of the
extra/added code, and this may be where the oops is
happening.  Dunno really, just wanted to warn you.
Thanks,
