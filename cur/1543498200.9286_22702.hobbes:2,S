Subject: [PATCH][RFC][FYI] Symlink caching
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	Folks, I've put a preliminary version of symlink-cache patch to
ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/symlink-patch-5.gz
	It's a one step above proof-of-concept - it compiles, boots,
survives the tests I've thrown into it so far but that's it. It's still
pretty rough. Comments are actively solicited, help with testing - only if
you are brave enough and ready to oopsen, leaks and other joys of
pre-alpha stuff.
	Mostly it's a big readlink()/follow_link() cleanup + moving
lookup_dentry() calls to do_follow_link() (goal: to kill recursion; I have
a code doing that but it's too messy right now; anyway that patch makes
recursion in lookup_dentry()/do_follow_link() much lighter) + symlink
cache. Some areas will be rewritten (new_name_struct(), for one), but for
now it will go.
	Sorry for the lack of accurate description - that will go with the
next version of patch (this evening or tomorrow). At least this variant
compiles, boots and didn't crash the box (yet). Uff...
							Cheers,
								Al
