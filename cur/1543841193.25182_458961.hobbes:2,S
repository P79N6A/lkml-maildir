Nevermind.  I thought because you changed struct pt_regs in ptrace_abi.h
it meant a user ABI change.

But they can get out of sync, e.g. when switch_to() restores the new
task's esp, the PDA still contains the old pcurrent and they don't get
synchronized until the write_pda() in __switch_to().

Would it make any sense to replace the 'cpu' field in thread_info with
a pointer to a PDA-like structure?  We could even embed the static per_cpu
data directly into that struct instead of chasing pointers...
