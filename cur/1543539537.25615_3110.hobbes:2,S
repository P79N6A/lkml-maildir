/usr/src/linux-2.2.14	if you are referring to the 2.2-14 kernel

I don't work with ntfs.

Just look in .config and refer to
/usr/src/linux-2.x.x/Documentation/Configure.help
or, more interestingly
Looking in main.c, one finds <linux/config.h> is included, and looking there
one finds <linux/autoconf.h> is included. Here <linux/*.h> refers to
/usr/include/linux/*.h
<linux/autoconf.h> is automatically generated by menuconfig and defines all
the preprocessor constants to configure the kernel during compilation. Of
course, menuconfig also generates the /usr/src/linux-2.x.x/.config file that
most users refer to in discussing kernel configuration.
So one may refer to <linux/autoconf.h> and
/usr/src/linux-2.x.x/Documentation/Configure.help to see how your kernel has
been configured. This is just the kernel space way to do it.
