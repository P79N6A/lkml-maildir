You need to also patch the lvm.c driver at the same time...  However, this
change now makes it very counter-intuitive compared to other kernel
functions.  Normally, we return 0 on success, and -ve on error.  Maybe
the RAID and LVM make_request functions should be changed to do that
instead (i.e. 0 on success, -ve on error, and maybe "1" if they do their
own recursion to break the loop)?
Cheers, Andreas
PS - I fixed the LVM mailing list address...
