eeh_add_device_tree_early is in eeh.c, which depends on CONFIG_EEH. but
pci_dlpar.c is compiled unconditionally. Current powerpc.git gives:
arch/powerpc/platforms/built-in.o(.text+0x99b8): In function `.pcibios_add_pci_devices':
: undefined reference to `.eeh_add_device_tree_early'
arch/powerpc/platforms/built-in.o(.text+0x9b40): In function `.pcibios_remove_pci_devices':
: undefined reference to `.eeh_remove_bus_device'
