There were such length checking bugs being discovered and fixed in the
past.  In particular, many got fixed between 2.2.18 and 2.2.19; that was
also when I added this hardening measure to -ow patches (starting with
2.2.19-ow1 released 5 years ago).
Of course, any known bugs should be fixed ASAP, but to me that is not a
sufficient reason to not keep a hardening measure like this.  It's just
a matter of opinion.
