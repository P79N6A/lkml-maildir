I know why this happens. Basically the problem is that right now we are
not checking if there are other cpus idle before rescheduling the current
task. This mean that we may have a CPU idle and we may not use it (even
if maybe the wakenup task prefer the idle cpu... bad).
So I developed a minimal patch (against 2.2.5) to avoid this scheduler
problem:

It fixes the problem fine here. Could you try out if this patch fixes your
problem too?
Side note: it's interesting to note that we are charging of major work the
last CPUS against the first cpu.
Today I also implemented a different reschedule_idle() that is indpendent
by the last three lines of UP code. My new experimental reschedule_idle()
in smp check all cpus-current-task and reschedule the lower priority task
also considering the preferred cpu of the wokenup process. But
unfortunatly it doesn't work fine yet and even if it would work fine it
wouldn't be something for 2.2.x ;). And it's not obvious that adding such
code in the wakeup path will be an improvement... (at least until we'll
not scale with much more cpus ;).
