Sure.  However, note that right now there is only one driver that
wants a range bigger than 256 (and has to split it).  UNIX 98 ptys.
All other character devices ask for less than that.  Block devices
are not asking for large ranges at all (it's either "map that area
this way" or "here's the range of device numbers for partitions of
that disk").
IOW, the only case that might be tempting is devpts.  And there we
simply don't care whether it's current 128:0--128:255, 129:0--129:255, ...
or 128:0--2047.  These guys live on a virtual fs that doesn't get
exported over network.
For now I'd propose to wrap large ranges over the major boundary _and_
have devpts ask for single range.  That allows to clean pty.c now (and have
current behaviour preserved) and after the switch we get only one change -
all these guys migrate to major 128.  Which, AFAICS, is a Good Thing(tm).
Everything else stays with the numebrs that are used now.
