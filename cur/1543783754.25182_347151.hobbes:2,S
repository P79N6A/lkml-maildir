Why not open the lock resource (or the lock space) instead of
individual locks as file? It then looks like this:
open lock space file
takelock lockresource lock1
do stuff
droplock lockresource lock1
close lock space file
Then if you are killed the ->release of lock space file should take
care of cleaning up all the locks
