As an extra datapoint I have very a very similar problem with a WD360
drive and an siimage 3112 PCI controller on a shuttle (via-based)
AK31V2.0 motherboard.
The sii3112 interfaces show up as ide0 and ide1 (can that be changed?)
using MMIO-DMA/pio.  Testing the drive as-is results in ~3.5MB/s
transfer rates (via hdparm -t), and attempting to enable DMA via
"hdparm -d 1" results in an immediate lockup the next time the drive
is accessed.
When I get another chance, I'll probably try the two fixes others in
this thread have suggested:
  hdparm -X66 -d1 /dev/hda
and if that still has trouble under load, someone suggested:
  echo "max_kb_per_request:15" > /proc/ide/hda/settings
Hope this helps.
(I'm not on the list right now, so please cc any replies you want to
 make sure I see -- thanks.)
