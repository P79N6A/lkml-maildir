What did you expect? They are making processors for money, and have
to push the sales.
As to HT, it's definitely a good thing. Multiple CPUs on a chip is
a logical step. HT in P4 is rather weak, but future processors will
likely have more advanced cores.
I never heard about HT from AMD camp. I'm curious what they do. ;)
