Look like you have commented anything, but OpenVZ :)
sure you don't like it, cause it doesn't add racy dcache accounting and works :)
speaking about overhead: have you done a single measurement of BC code?

1. some resources can contribute to multiple BC params, thus need to be accounted
   atomically into 2 counters.
2. spin_lock()/spin_unlock() has the same 1 lock operation on SMP on most archs
3. using atomic counters you can't get a snapshot of current usages.
4. all the performance critical resources should be handled with pre-charges,
   as it is done in TCP/IP accounting in mainstream and as it is done for
   files/kmemsize in OpenVZ.

its overhead is minor compared to accounting itself (atomic operations).

in this patchset it is not used AFAICS.
however, it was taken from the full BC patch where it is used to handle 
resource denials as most gracefully as possible.

Agree with this. This patch doesn't prove that BCs can be integrated to the
containers infrastructure.

Do you see any problems with these except for not-needed-anywhere-now? P)
