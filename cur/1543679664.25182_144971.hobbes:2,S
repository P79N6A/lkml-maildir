If we're thinking about the same thing, the basic idea was to store
information into a higher level object and make more intelligent paging
decisions based on the higher level object.  In my brain, since I'm a
SunOS guy, that means that you store information in the vnode (inode)
which reflects the status of all pages backed by this inode.
Instead of trying to figure out what to do at the page level, you figure
out what to do at the object level.

I can't find the writeup that you are thinking about.  I know what you mean,
there was a discussion of paging algs and I went off about how scanning a
page a time is insane.  If someone finds the URL let me know.
