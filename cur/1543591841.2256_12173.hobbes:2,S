And they can grab the latest tools too.  Why is this a problem again?
python1.5.x is compatiable w/ python2 EXCEPT in the cases where the script
uses undocumented things which did work in python1.5.x.  But that's not as
big of a problem since they can co-exist.  Debian already does this (And thus
CML2 already deals with python2 being called 'python2') and I wouldn't be
supprised if the PowerTools python2 rpm someone pointed out makes them
co-exist as well.
Which brings up another point, RedHat (7.1?) and Debian/woody both have the
option of having python2 around.  Anyone know about mandrake?  My point is
that some dists are already dealing with python2.

Well no, but python1 requires another 2k lines of python code or so.
Eric, would it be easy/possible to go back to requiring python 1.5.x for
CML2, since that is what many dists ship with?

Maybe, maybe not.  Forgetting about the QA time and whatnot, there's good
odds that all of the python scripts RedHat (for example) ships will just
work with python2.  I know one of the PPC dists didn't ship with python2
(which does have a lot of python bits to it) entirely because they were
already in testing when it came out.  It's not something the distros
can switch to at a whim, but it's also something which shouldn't cause
them problems when they do.
