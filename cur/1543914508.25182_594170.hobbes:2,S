Roman,
I've been trying to follow your mails about CFS since your review posted
on Aug 1st. Back to that date, I was thinking "cool, an in-depth review
by someone who understands schedulers and mathematics very well, we'll
quickly have a very solid design".
On Aug 10th, I was disappointed to see that you still had not provided
the critical information that Ingo had been asking to you for 9 days
(cfs-sched-debug output). Your motivations in this work started to
become a bit fuzzy to me, since people who behave like this generally
do so to get all the lights on them and you really don't need this.
Your explanation was kind of "show me yours and only then I'll show
you mine". Pretty childish but you finally sent that long-requested
information.
Since then, I've been noticing your now popular "will I get a response
to my questions" stuffed in most of your mails. That was getting very
suspicious from someone who can write down mathematics equations to
prove his design is right, especially considering the fact that your
"question" only relates to what a few lines were supposed to do. Nobody
believes that someone as smart as you is still blocked on the same
line of code after one month!
And if getting CFS fixed wasn't your real motivation...

I'm now fairly convinced that you're not seeking credits either. There
are more credits to your name per line of patch here than there is in
your own code in the kernel. That complaint does not stand by itself.
In fact, I'm beginning to think that you're like a cat who has found a mouse.
Why kill it if you can play with it ? Each of your "will I get a response"
are just like a small kick in the mouse's back to make it move. But by dint
of doing this, you're slowly pushing the mouse to the door where it risks
to escape from you, and you're losing your toy.
So right now, I'm sure you really do not want to get any code merged. It's
so much fun for you to say "hey, Ingo, respond to me" that you would lose
this ability would your code get merged.

At that time, if my memory serves me, you were complaining about a fairness
problem you had with a few programs that you already took days to show the
sources. Proposing an alternate design with a bug report generally has no
chance to be considered because the developer mostly focuses on the bug
report. You should have spent time explaining how your design would work
*after* your problems were solved.

  any comment around it, then how is it believable that you have a problem
  understanding 10 lines of code after 1 month ?
>, but it also demonstrated a number of improvements.
Very likely, reason why Ingo and Peter accepted to take parts of those
improvements. But do you realize that your lack of ability to communicate
on this list has probably delayed mainline integration of parts of your
work, because it was required to get a patch to try to understand your
intents ? It's not sci.math here, its linux-kernel, the _development_
mailing list, where the raw material and common language between people
is the _code_. Some people do not have the skills required to code their
excellent ideas, but they can spend time explaining those to other people.
In your case, it was just a guess game. It does not work like this and
you know it. I really think that you deliberately slowed all the process
down in order to stay on the scene playing this game.

Even your question here is suspicious: the fact that you wonder whether you're
the only one implies you think it could be possible, thus implying something
intentionally targetted at you. And no, do not tell me you meant you could
have failed your git-clone command, you would have asked differently, such
as "sorry, I cannot clone from there right now".
You're taking advantage of everything around you to show that there is a
deliberate intention not to cooperate.

Once again: implied accusation of things being done without you knowing about
them. What's wrong with this? Fortunately, Linus does not tell you when he
merges a patch by someone different than you.

Not trying to take Ingo's defense because I too think he tends to show his
code when it's well advanced, but it's often required to work with pencil
and paper for hours before you suddenly can start. After that, it's true
that changes can advance very fast. After all, how many iterations did you
send before the patch that Ingo and Peter used ? Only one (or maybe zero,
depending on what patch they started with). So you're dishonnest again.
> Patches may be your primary form of communication, but that isn't 
> true for many other people,
It's true that most of my family and relatives do not speak this language,
but you would find it funny to discover that on this list, it's the most
common form of expression. Look at the subjects. Most of them begin with
'[PATCH]'. And even code reviews are done in patch form with lines starting
with '-' and '+'. I won't tell you further, I know you know it, you were
just playing the dumb.
> with patches a lot of intent and motivation for a change is lost.
Yes, that's true. And I think that you deliberately avoided any comments
in your code exactly for this reason: slow down its integration process
to play a bit longer here. Would it have been that hard to put comments
to indicate people *your* intents ?

This is funny! Several people have been asking you to reformulate your
ideas that nobody could understand because of your math notation, which
you never did (at least not completely, just some parts). The conventional
manner _is_ the patch on LKML.
> Are you afraid it might hurt your

Not speaking for Ingo of course, but I'd ask "and you?". Do you feel any
particular pride of being able to send formulas nobody understands, and
would it hurt your status explaining them to the normal people? (I mean
"normal" for this list, you remember, the ones who only communicate in
English or Patch).

I don't get it, it cannot hide a history. It happens to me very often to
rediff any set of patches and/or launch interdiff to see what changed
between multiple versions. On the other hand, if you would send 3 consecutive
mails with your magnificient formulas, nobody would notice any change!
> A more conventional way of communication would give more people a chance

Exactly, that's what was asked to you! After 15 minutes reading your mail and
trying to decipher it, I finally gave up. That's sad because it looked very
interesting. I'm all for demonstrable designs instead of empirical ones.

I think that it's what Ingo and Peter did: try to apply their understanding
of your concepts to their implementation, without being too much dependant
on you to come up with a solution.

And we're at it! You've been controlling the situation pretty well for the
last month. People politely entreating you to explain what you considered
wrong, how your design worked, etc... Even your mail rate on LKML has
doubled since August. You might have been feeling horny!

Right now, nobody saves the day. The Linux development process looks like
a playground with little kids sending sand into their eyes. Lamentable!

You do not appear sincere. You might have been believing this the first
few days, but insisting for ONE MONTH on this part of the code means
that you found a flaw in it or you found it did not serve any purpose,
and you wanted Ingo to tell you anything about this so that you could
reply "bullshit, it does not work". Now I suspect it was simply useless
and they finally realized it then removed the code. What would it have
cost you to say "It seems to me that this code does nothing" ? You would
have got credited for it, since you're asking for that.

You know like me that explaining concepts by mail take *a lot* of time. I
even refuse to do this anymore with the people I work with. Wasting 4 hours
writing down something which goes to the bin in 5 minutes is stupid at best.
Better refine the thinking all in our corners, and either meet or discuss
the small pieces by mail.

And why is this wrong ? I too spend a lot of time reducing and optimizing
code, sometimes even 1 hour to reduce some primitives by a few bytes or
cycles on most architectures I can test, and it often pays off. At this
stage of the development, its not unreasonable to try to reduce code size,
since it is not meant to change a lot. And 15% is not bad at all!

That's clearly possible. But how would one say, given the level of outbound
filtering you apply to your advices ?

Ah, this is where the useful information was hidden. In most mails from you,
there's often : 
  - a ton of crap
  - one complaint
  - a ton of crap
  - a very useful advice
  - a ton of crap
Very easy after that yo ask for responses to your question and to say "I told
you 1 month ago...". And don't pretend it's unintentional, I've been playing
the same game with some other people for years in other contexts!

Many people would be amazed how much you exagerate the fact that there are
differences. Indeed, of those 6 lines, 5 are about similarity, and one is
about a different implementation and math. I don't see "how much he stresses
the differences".

Ah, the episode of the guy having his code counterfeited with no credit.
Anyway, since it's your idea, I too think that there should be coments in
the code stating this, close to the explanations.

And this reason is ?

It would be stupid if they had to reimplement something they did not
understand from your work. I would personally feel really desperate if
I spent that much time inventing very smart concepts that people did
not get right because I was totally unable to explain something with
humain-understandable words.

I believe you on this one.

I don't believe you on this one. Getting help is mostly what Ingo and Peter
have been seeking from you and got in small parts with lots of difficulties.
You could show everyone here that your brain really needs no help when it
comes to play with those algorithms, but it likes to play and often with
the same games.

Not credible, you should renice the amazing factor in your complaints, it's
just a poor theatre play we're assisting to. With slightly less exageration,
it might be believable.

That's true. What's unfortunate is that this proof was also the first

Oh, the persecuted guy again with his persistant pain due to the lack of
answer to his same question since last month.

False! It's the way you're trying to prove Ingo is a bastard and that you're
a victim. But if we just re-read a few pick-ups of your mails since Aug 1st,
its getting pretty obvious that you completely made up this situation. And
I can only applaud you very high manipulation skills, I'm impressed, because
you got me for a long time. But as always when such people are constantly
pushing the limits further, they reveal themselves.

On some complex algorithms, you may be right. But a quick and dirty patch
has the advantage of showing the ideas and concepts in a way that many
people can understand and comment on.

Well, what are you going to do next?
  - wait for a no response and say "everybody, look, the weak bastard in front
    of me refuses the fight" ?
  - split up your patches and add comments in them so that Ingo and Peter
    finally understand what you really mean and not only what you're willing
    to show them ?
  - open a new thread on LKML detailing your ideas one at a time and proposing
    others to implement them if you cannot code cleanly ?
  - anything else? (eg: consult a specialist in schizophrenia?)
You could at least choose to prove your intent to contribute by rediffing
your patch against the last one which tries to imitate it, and commenting
the result, then splitting it up in as many parts as you see fit. And to
reuse a phrase from your last mail :
> Is this really too much to expect?
I sincerely hope you'll make everyone benefit from your unequalled skills,
and that you will stop playing cat and mouse. It's boring for many people,
and counter-productive.
