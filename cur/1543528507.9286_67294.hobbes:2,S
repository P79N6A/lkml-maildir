Here somebody decided that the "ideal" way of doing a project was
to have shared-memory between all the workstations so communications
was "automatic". This was in the 10 mb/s days.
The result was like using a knotted string for memory. Update a single
byte in shared memory and it has to go to all the workstations as
a minimum-size packet. Then all the workstations have to send back
a copy of their new memory image, etc. Necessary locking had the
latency of the network, etc.
This is not something you really should do, even with a light-pipe.
As Richard said, just send messages. It's quick, it's robust, and
no locking issues exist (for the interface).
Cheers,
