the first two patches are fine with me, they're basically my patches
with the bugs fixed and the missing conversions done, so they must be
good ;-)
can't really comment on the third one because I don't understand the
aio internals good enough.
Onced this goes to -mm we should add a third patch to kill
generic_file_read/generic_file_write and convert all filesystems to the
aio/vectored variant and use do_sync_read/do_sync_write for
.read/.write.  The major syscalls use the aio_ variant directly anyway,
this is only needed for some special cases like the ELF loader.
Removing generic_file_read/generic_file_write will finally cut filemap.c
back to a sane size.
