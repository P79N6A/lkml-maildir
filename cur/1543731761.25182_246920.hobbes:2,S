Hi. Sorry for the silly question from a user who can't code their way out of a 
paper bag, but I have compiled 2.6.9-rc1-bk5 and currently running okay (the 
nvidia module will now compile) with no oops so far. But K3B still does not 
work - as with 2.6.8.1. 
Am I right in assuming that this is the way things will be done in the kernel 
from now on and that we will need new versions of k3b/cdrecord to run with 
these newer kernels? 
Without knowing a better way, I am currently using the same sort of quick 
patch as 2.6.8.1 to use k3b on 2.6.9-rc1-bk5 ie:
