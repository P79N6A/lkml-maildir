Its easy to see why
The graphics market between Nvidia and ATI is extreme rivalry
There have been some ugly patent lawsuits
Good software tricks can make the weaker hardware win
Its very hard to write
So there are real secrets left in the market. Designing a SCSI
controller isn't exactly a McJob but its commodity.
Nvidia are at least trying to do what they can within what for them is
not a very easy set of market conditions for open sourcing. ATI were
doing very nice things until they won the Xbox 360 contract. An
observation that perhaps would not go amiss reaching the US legal
watchdogs.
