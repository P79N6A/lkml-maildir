There is hacking CML2 (the configuration files), and there is hacking
CML2 tools (rule compiler, GUI, ...), only the latter of which requires
Python knowledge.
Python is not that hard too read, and there's always someone you can ask
to explain you some clauses you don't get; and although I've never
looked at the CML2 tools, I looked at fetchmail, and the source has
EXTENSIVE documentation compared to many other projects, so I don't
think Eric did spaghetti (obfuscated) code in his CML2 tools. After all,
it would not be too helpful to counter the goals for CML2 with the very
implementation...
