It's necessary.
While the patch you was using is 100% safe, Manfred Spraul used a bit
different approch in the `dmesg` case that will avoid a kmalloc. The
differences between my last patch and Manfred's patch are minor issues but
it worth to use Manfred's approch in `dmesg` for the official kernel.
So here it is the latest and greatest patch extracted by 2.3.x:
	
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/andrea/kernel-patches/my-2.2.12/printk-races-2.2.11-D
NOTE NOTE: if you are using printk-races-2.2.11-C you _don't_ need to
upgrade to the -D version since my -C version was just 100% safe, it just
fixes all the races and you can't notice the performance difference in
`dmesg` between the -C and -D versions.
