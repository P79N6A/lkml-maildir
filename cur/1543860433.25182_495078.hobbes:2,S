Update: Amarok was set to auto-detect the backend, KDE uses ALSA backend.
On 2.6.20-rc2, if I force Amarok to alsa backend, I get a message that
xine could not initialized any drivers and no sound. If I force it
to use oss interface Amarok works fine.
On 2.6.19 both alsa and oss work fine.
So it seems that something broken in the alsa API in my 2.6.20-rc2.
