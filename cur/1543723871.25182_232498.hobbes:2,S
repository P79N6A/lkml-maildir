I've been getting the same problem on a somewhat different setup (see
below for details).
However I've narrowed things down the situation where if I remove one
PCI card the machine boots. I replace it and get exactly the same crash
as yours.
The card in question in the CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments PCI1410 PC
card Cardbus Controller as listed below.
Of note is that recent 2.4 kernels have failed to set this card up
properly. Older 2.4's, up to 2.4.22 (or maybe 2.4.23) work fine, but
later ones misdetect the inserted Cardbus card.
I've only tried 2.6.7 on this machine cos I need to get the Cardbus
support working again...
So I suggest pulling out PCI cards until either you discover a culprit,
or have no PCI cards left plugged in.
Anyhow, those details I mentioned:
