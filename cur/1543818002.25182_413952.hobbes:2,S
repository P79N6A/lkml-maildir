'man auditd' and friends.  This is providing after-the-fact reporting
of security-related events for audit and forensic analysis.  We have *no*
idea if it will fill your needs, because you have explained what you're
trying to *do* with ptrace.  If you merely need a record that a syscall
happened, this is what you want.  If you want to apply a security restriction,
you want to look at SELinux or perhaps a custom LSM.  If you have some
other need, you need some other tool.
So what problem are you trying to solve by using ptrace()?

"That is an old worn-out magic word" -- ADVENT.FOR
I think that's a leftover from before the audit subsystem was converted
to use netlink.

Well, this is how auditd talks to the netlink socket.  Whether it supports
the functionality you need in a unpatched kernel depends on what you're
trying to do (which you still haven't explained).

Good. Please enlighten us what the proper system behavior is, if *two* processes
are ptrace()ing the same target process - and one specifies PTRACE_CONT and
the other PTRACE_SINGLESTEP (or other conflicting pairs of requests...)
Handling two PTRACE_{GET|POKE}* requests for the same data looks massively
racy as well, as there's no defined way to say what order to handle them.
But hey - if you're comfortable and get warm fuzzies about the idea that one
process could use PTRACE_POKEDATA to set the variable 'a_upper_lim' to 23, and
the other could use it to set a_upper_lim to -10, and then execution resumes
with no clear indication of which one actually gets used, that's OK by us...
(Or for more fun - what if one process sends a PTRACE_CONT before the other one
gets a shot at it to do the PTRACE_POKEDATA, at which point you're storing into
a already-running process (bonus points for knowing if the live value is in a
register or in memory at the time you get there with a non-stopped process ;)

LAuS was a long-ago predecessor of the current audit system.  At the time
it was written, it was correct, but it no longer is.
