Beyond that, allno doesn't come close to switching everything off.
1) You have to _enable_ CONFIG_EMBEDDED in order to go into that menu and 
switch _off_ the stuff in there.
2) The stuff CONFIG_EMBEDDED reveals isn't all in that menu.  CONFIG_BLOCK is 
at the top level menu.  CONFIG_VT and CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS are buried down 
under device drivers->character devices, and there's more sprinkled all over.  
You have to track it all down and switch it off to get an _actual_ 
allnoconfig kernel.
(I cut the bit where you reinvent miniconfig.  People keep doing this.  I dig 
it up and resubmit it every year or so, so Roman Zippel can shoot it down 
again.  Meanwhile, not only is Firmware Linux happily using it, but I even 
wrote more documentation at 
http://landley.net/code/firmware/new_platform.html
 although you have to 
scroll down a bit to get to the stuff about miniconfig...)
