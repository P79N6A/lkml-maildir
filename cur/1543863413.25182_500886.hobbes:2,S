Hi!
I can give you an idea of the workload :-) I have the same problem on an 
nearly idle Server. There runs only a few cronjobs (normal Debian System 
crons).
The load was not higher than 0.01 on this system the last 3 days and 
this morning it crashes with the same error.
I've not tested 2.6.19.x cause this one has some problems with SATA AHCI 
driver which we need. But i can manuelly update only this system with 
2.6.19.x and wait some days.
There were no other messages in the log.
Cheers,
    Stefan
