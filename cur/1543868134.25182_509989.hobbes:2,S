+ * The volume table unit.
+ *
+ * This unit is responsible for maintaining the volume table. The volume table
+ * is an on-flash table containing volume meta-data like volume name, number of
+ * reserved physical eraseblocks for this volume, volume type, etc. The volume
+ * table is stored in the so-called "layout volume".
+ *
+ * The layout volume is an internal volume where the volume table is stored.
+ * Actually, there are 2 equivalent copies of the volume table in the layout
+ * volume. The layout volume it organized as follows. It consists of two
+ * logical eraseblocks - LEB 0 and LEB 1. Each logical eraseblock stores a copy
+ * the volume table, i.e. LEB 0 and LEB 1 duplicate each other. This redundancy
+ * guarantees robustness and tolerance to unclean reboots. The volume table is
+ * a mere array of so-called "volume table records". Each record contains full
+ * information about the volume and is protected by a CRC checksum.
+ *
+ * The volume table is changed as follows. It is first changed in RAM. Then LEB
+ * 0 is erased, and the updated volume table is written back to LEB 0. The same
+ * is done with LEB 1. This scheme guarantees recoverability from unclean
+ * reboots.
+ *
+ * At this UBI implementation the on-flash volume table does not contain about
+ * how many data a static volume actually stores. This information may be found
+ * out while scanning (from the EB headers) so we do not store it in the
+ * on-flash volume table. So, as long as we have an unscalable UBI
+ * implementation which uses scanning, we may live without that. In case of a
+ * scalable implementation, this would be required.
+ *
+ * But it would be beneficial to store this information in the volume table.
+ * For example, suppose we have a static volume X, and all its physical
+ * eraseblocks have gone bad for some reasons. Suppose we are attaching the
+ * corresponding MTD device, the scanning unit finds no logical eraseblocks
+ * corresponding to the volume X. According to the volume table volume X does
+ * exist. So we don't know whether it is just empty or all its physical
+ * eraseblocks went bad. So we cannot alarm the user about this corruption.
+ *
+ * Note, although we don't store this information in the on-flash volume table,
+ * we keep it in the in-RAM copy of this table just because it is quite
+ * convenient.
+ *
+ * The volume table also stores so-called "update marker" which is used to
+ * implement the update operation. Before updating the volume, the update
+ * marker is set, after the update operation is finished, the update marker is
+ * cleared. So if the update operation was interrupted (e.g. by an unclean
+ * reboot) - the update marker is still there and we know that the volume's
+ * contents is damaged.
+ *
+ * Note, in this implementation we do not support concurrent updates and only
+ * one volume at a time may be updated.
