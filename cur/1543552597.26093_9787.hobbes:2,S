OK, I include below a more or less translation for 2.4.  I have not even
compiled this, and have not got the hardware to test it anyway.
However, on the bus this morning, I though about this again and wondered
that this may not the correct way to do this.  What we actually want to
power manage is the PCI device as a whole not each interface independantly,
which I would assume is impossible anyway.
2.4 provides another power management interface for PCI drivers - the
suspend and resume elements of the pci_driver struct.  These have
the advantage of the driver being called in the correct order with
respect to power being removed/resumed to the bus that the device
is actually hanging off.  Unfortunately, the IDE code does not use
the "new" (quoted from Documentation/pci.txt) pci_register_driver
interface.
Also, the suspend/resume logic should include code to actually turn
the device off and on.
Where do we go from here?
Cheers,
Stephen
