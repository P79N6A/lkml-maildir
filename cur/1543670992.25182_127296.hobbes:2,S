From the POSIX Test Suite perspective, we were planning on first focusing
testing on the CGL 2.0 priority 1 POSIX features, which would mean the
threads functions with the THR tag in IEEE1003.1-2001.  But, it would be
great to know what gaps current implementations (like NPTL) have against
this tag in the POSIX spec.  Is there a way we can get more details on the
current gaps you mentioned?  I'm wondering how they will affect conformance
to the THR tag functions.
