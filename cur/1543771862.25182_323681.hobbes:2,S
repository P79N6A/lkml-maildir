Where did you get "the latest libata-dev patch" from?
I don't see anything for 2.6.12 on Jeff's web directory,
just a bunch of older 2.6.11 patches instead.
Sure, I (and everyone else on the planet) could do the 15-gadzillion steps
to download and install the piecemeal git stuff, but that shouldn't be
necessary for non-developers to do.
Is there a cumulative libata-dev patch for 2.6.12 available somewhere?
Cheers
