Show me a single fs that
	a) is implemented in Linux
	b) supports ownership/permissions (critical for /etc and /sbin at
the very least)
	c) doesn't support devices
	d) has sufficiently stable Linux implementation.
Let's see: in 2.3 we have the following
	adfs - not funny
	affs - choke full of races. _Really_. It's much worse than I
thought originally. If you want I can post the local changelog - there are
biggies and it's still not suitable even for alpha-testing.
	autofs, devpts, procfs - can't hold regular files.
	coda, efs, ext2, isofs, minix, nfs, qnx4, romfs, sysv, udf, ufs -
support devices (qnx4 is unmaintained, BTW)
	msdos, vfat, smbfs, hfs, ncpfs - no ownership
	umsdos - supports devices (stability aside)
	hpfs, ntfs - stability
In the list above hpfs and ntfs can be trivially forced to support devices
(heck, hpfs _does_ support them already). So _which_ non-UNIX filesystems
are we talking about? AFFS? Support for devices can be added there. Excuse
me, but it's a strawman.
