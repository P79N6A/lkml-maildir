I have an N5415, and am using your k7 patch (thanks much!).  I don't use USB,
so I didn't try or comment on your patch.  However, I was never able to get
ACPI to work.  If I compiled it in without APM compiled in, it always hung on
boot.  So, I have only APM, which doesn't even show the battery life
correctly.  Whether or not I can suspend, knowing battery life would be an
improvement.  Is there something special I have to do to get ACPI to work? 
(I'm currently using 2.4.13-ac7-preempt-k7, but I've tried 2.4.1[56] also, as
well as many earlier kernels.)
