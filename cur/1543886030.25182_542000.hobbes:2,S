Would a general split between probe() (check if we can handle the
device, do very basic stuff) and setup() (get the device up and
running) make sense? Drivers could stay with today's probe() function
if they want to (and still be working). setup() could be, but need not
be async. As an added benefit for huge systems, setup() might only be
called if explicitly requested (like "only do this heavy lifting
if/when we really want to use the device"). probe() could call bind()
and setup() (doing the firmware load etc.) heavy_init(). (This may be
orthogonal to the probe()/probe_async() idea.)
