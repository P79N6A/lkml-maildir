This needs to be designed.
Perhaps /foo/bar/baz.tar.gz/tar/metas is the directory in the tarball
named "metas".
Or perhaps /foo/bar/baz.tar.gz/x/metas is: it's independent of archive
format, and I personally tend to extract things into a directory
called "x". [*]
Or perhaps /foo/bar/baz.tar.gz/metas is, and the attribute directory
is /foo/bar/baz.tar.gz/../metas, to be perverse ;)
I prefer the second one, ("x/metas"), but not with any conviction.

[*] Actually I prefer:
      /foo/bar/baz.tar.gz/content/metas
      /foo/bar/baz-0.01.tar.gz/content/baz-0.01/metas
           Archives always in "content".  One layer of decompression
           always tried for .tar files and other uncompressed archive
           formats.
      /foo/bar/baz.tar.gz/x -> content/
      /foo/bar/baz-0.01.tar.gz/x -> content/baz-0.01/
           If the root of the archive contains a single directory, "x"
           is a symlink to it.  Otherwise "x" is a symlink to the root
           directory of the archive.  This is comfortable with the
           common practice by which archives are distributed, without
           making a mess when someone forgets to put everything in a
           top-level directory.
