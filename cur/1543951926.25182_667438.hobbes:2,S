There were no changes to thinkpad-acpi that should have caused this.  So I
need more data to find out what is happening.  Might be a problem elsewhere
in ACPI, or some bug in thinkpad-acpi.
You DO have /proc/acpi/event, correct?  Please send me the debug output of
thinkpad-acpi when it is loaded with "debug=0xffff" as a parameter (and for
extra bonus, please compile it with the verbose debug Kconfig option).
Also, send me the output of 
"grep . /sys/bus/platform/devices/thinkpad_acpi/*"
