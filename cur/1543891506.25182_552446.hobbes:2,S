Ok, it wasn't a hidden oops. The DISABLE_CONSOLE_SUSPEND=y thing sometimes 
shows oopses that are otherwise hidden, but at other times it just causes 
more problems (hard hangs when trying to display something on a device 
that is suspended, or behind a bridge that got suspended).
In your case, the screen output just shows normal resume output, and it 
apparently just hung for some unknown reason. It *may* be worth trying to 
do a SysRQ + 't' thing to see what tasks are running (or rather, not 
running), but since you won't be able to capture it, it's probably not 
going to be useful.

It would be interesting to see what triggered it, since it apparently 
worked before. So yes, a bisection would be great.
