Its booting !!!!
I tried to build a 2.4.1kernel, but it had problems with my newer ld so 
I tried again with a 2.4.17 following Alans instructions.
I passed mem=6 and it booted. I then expeimented upping this value and 
it still boots when I pass mem=32m ( the actual amount of ram in the 
machine ). So I guess it was just a problem of the box lieing about its 
memory.
Many thanks for all you help, its really appreciated.
