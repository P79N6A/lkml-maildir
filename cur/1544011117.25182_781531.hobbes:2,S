Subject: [PATCH 1/many] PROC macro to annotate functions in assembly files
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/17/106

Introduce the PROC macro in the generic header file
include/linux/linkage.h to annotate functions in assembly
files. This is a first step to fully annotate functions
(procedures) in .S-files. The PROC macro complements the
already existing and being used ENDPROC macro. The generic
implementation of PROC is exactly the same as ENTRY.
The goal is to annotate functions, at least those called
from C code, with PROC at the beginning and ENDPROC at the
end. This is for the benefit of debugging and tracing. It
will also allow to introduce a framework to check for
nesting problems and missing annotations in a later stage
by overriding ENTRY/END and PROC/ENDPROC in architecture-
specific code, after the annotation errors have been fixed.
