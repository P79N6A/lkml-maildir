Yes.

I don't buy that argument. Assuming that the values will always result 
in an identical brightness is making incorrect assumptions about the 
API. For example, consider the case where a bug means that only half the 
hardware's available brightness levels are exposed. Fixing that bug 
would change the meaning of the numbers, but it's not an API change in 
any real way. Anyone using the backlight class should check the 
maximum_brightness field before deciding what range of values to use.
