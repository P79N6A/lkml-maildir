Hey ao, I was looking for you last week, nice to know you're back

Yes, I definitely agree with this, it's just that there's a need of
people being able to contribute to it and have something done.

Anyways, LSM does *not* provide the solution itself, so, commenting that
the framework achieved such following the point 1 it's not completely
accurate.
It's just the *way* to deploy such security, unless you *deply and
implement* something following such *way*.
The costs come when you stop using the framework itself and making use
of a solution that relies in it, then the overhead it's a thing in
charge of the people who use and design the solution.

I agree, but it depends on what do you want to achieve with such use of
checks and logics.

Of course many interfaces are Linux specific, that's how they wanted to
do them :)
But, for example, this wasn't a reason to stop the effort to port
SELinux functionalities to FreeBSD by the TrustedBSD project.
Maybe it's not all the big the problem seems to be, or at least I hope.

If it achieves the goal that you remark, why you should care on how
exactly auditing happens within the framework if you are going to
externally make use of such features?

Yes, but adding such checks add further overhead and if they are
implmented in a dirty-#if-#etc manner, then it's not up for mainline,
AFAIK, but this should be commented by an "official" kernel folk.

Yes, but again, it depends if we are talking about high scalability
systems or whatever uncommon-for-us (at least me, :P) environment.
Then the lowest overhead can't be acceptable.

I mean that it depends on when the LSM hook is called, if before or
after the DAC checks.

Agreed.

It depends on which scope you're talking about.
From rom the side of the developer, it's a thing in charge of such developer
to bother with them with care.

I agree with you with that point, anyways, that's a point I can't talk
further.

I'm not someone really concerned about the stacking issue as I notice in
my first email, but regarding your structures-related comment.. for
example task_struct or others? normally the structures are defined in a
manner that they can access properties members of other structures (ie.
inode) or make use of globally available structures (ie. current).
What you can't do is to initialize them without knowing if they are
already initialized and so on, again this is more related with developer
side than a weak implementation.

Yes, it gets registered as primary but you can pass a disabling argument
to it so it wouldn't prevent you for making use of other modules.
(ie. SELinux uses another "slot").

I agree with you, but going back to stacking issue then this is just a
consequence.

Haven't worked out such features, but will notice after I do it :)

Yes, it's a personal remark.

Yes, that's maintenance overhead but again a thing that can be solved
with collaboration between both independent developers and the kernel
folks.

I agree, the point is that a good stacking design can solve most of
these issues AFAIK.

I agree, just didn't wanted to enter into a *real* political flame on
what security can mean for me or others.

I didn't re-invented the wheel, didn't needed to change anything within
the LSM framework (at least talking about MAC for example), etc.
I hadn't time to implement further models, but I will give some a try
after I get finished some personal stuff.

It was a good bunch of all of them, just supposed you were talking on
Immunix.

Sure ;)

I can't disagree with this one, but sometimes licenses make companies
doing things they even don't like, which are of our own benefit.

Just trying to help and make noise around, wondering if something comes

Yes, sadly.
Anyways, it's only a matter of politics, but a really difficult one.
Cheers and many thanks for your comments,
