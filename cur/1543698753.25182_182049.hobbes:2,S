Issue now yes.  Three pieces of evidence:
1)
I hear CD-RW commonly report 64 KiB per write block, DVD-RAM/ DVD+RW
often report 32 KiB per write block.
2)

is me saying a naive lk 2.6 test like `dd if=/dev/scd0 bs=1M` doesn't
yet improve read thruput by polite alignment, much less improve write
thruput by polite alignment.
Specifically I see we lose alignment in the second cdb and following,
til the end of the disc.

is me saying cdrom.ko does not yet fetch via SCSI over whatever (USB2HS/
ATAPIUDMA133/ 1394a/ ...) the 1999 ANSI T10 standard plug 'n play
descriptor that distinguishes the 32/64 KiB bytes per write block from
the 2 KiB bytes per read block.  (Relevant patches appear incomplete,
nearby.)
