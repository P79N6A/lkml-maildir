Great. Glad you have a workaround now.

Heh. Yea, I'm amazed you were able to flash it and still have the system
boot. I'd suggest making sure you have the proper and current BIOS, as
its *very* difficult for folks to help debug problems on unofficial or
unsupported hardware/firmware configs.
I believe ioapic support should function correctly regardless (or be
blacklisted and with others reporting problems, its might not be just
this BIOS issue), so after you get your BIOS sorted out, please let me
know if the problem still persists.
thanks
