This patch fixes a race between the CMOS clock setting and the NMI
code.  The NMI code indiscriminatly sets index registers and values
in the same place the CMOS clock is set.  If you are setting the
CMOS clock and an NMI occurs, Bad values could be written to or
read from the CMOS RAM, or the NMI operation might not occur
correctly.
Resetting the NMI is not required on x86_64 (in fact, it should
not be done according to the ICH5 documentation).  This patch
simply removes the useless code.
