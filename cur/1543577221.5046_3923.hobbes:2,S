Not really. Under very high VFS loads we'd just scan
through the list twice and free the entries anyway.
The only time when this scanning is an improvement is
when we have something like a "working set" for the
dentry cache *and* the refill/scan rate is constant
enough that that "working set" doesn't get flooded out
by the new dentry pages.
Note that creating a new dentry doesn't set the
referenced bit exactly to avoid this from happening.
regards,
Rik
