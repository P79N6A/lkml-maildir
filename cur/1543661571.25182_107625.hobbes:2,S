On my box one of the devices sharing the interrupt with the disk
is the display, the USB is quiet with no devices connected.  I am 
running 2.4.21-pre4-ac2.  I'd have redistributed interrupts but the 
motherboard dosen't allow me to specifically set them and APIC isn't 
supposed to work on the nForce2 yet.
