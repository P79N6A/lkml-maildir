Hi all,
I  tried to build 2.5.73 on my SMP alpha, but get the following
compile-time failure:
[...]
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  UPD     include/linux/compile.h
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      vmlinux
ld: arch/alpha/kernel/built-in.o: !samegp reloc against symbol without .prologue: memset
make[1]: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
I tried gcc-3.3 and 2.95.4, binutils is 2.14.90.0.4
This problem has been introduced with the __kernel_execve 
reimplementation. 
Any ideas ?  ( what puzzles me, is that i am apparently the only
alpha user with that problem... )
Regards,
Thomas Weyergraf
