I added this patch to -mm.

The rule is:
- If the patch patches something which is in Linus's kernel, prepare a
  diff against Linus's latest kernel.
- If the patch patches something which is only in -mm, prepare a patch
  against -mm.
In this case, I merged the patch prior to the kgdb patch and then fixed
up the fallout.
(If that causes kgdb to break in non-obvious-to-me ways then I might come
calling "help".  We'll see)
