Erm... Flat address space is Good Thing(tm). Very small part of userland
needs to know about the major size.

No, you don't. mknod(2) takes dev_t as an argument. Just feed the thing
as is and don't bother with the splitting it up. stat(2) also returns
plain dev_t, so...

Urgh... Then you will be better off patching register_disk().

I don't promise 300k - core of each driver will remain as-is, but glue is
going to shrink. As soon as I'll sort the IDE stuff out[1] I'll submit the
next patch to Linus. And it looks like it will be the last one _adding_
code - from there on it's a big butchery.
BTW, I suspect that you might win quite a few blocks if you will modify
insmod and teach it to load gziped modules. Or just use cramfs...
[1] bloody thing works, but I'ld like to know what (if anything) stops it
from breaking apart...
