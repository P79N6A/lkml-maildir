I've attached the output of dmesg with the i8042.nomux option and without. The 
laptop is a Xeron Sonic Power Plus (Similar to this one: 
http://www.xeron.com/index.php4?id=1255
 -- sorry, there seems to be no 
english translation of this page). Xeron puts together laptops in exact the 
configuration you like. Only the motherboards are the same. But I don`t know 
the motherboard vendor/type.
