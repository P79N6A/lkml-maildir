You *really* should use the kernel Makefile structure instead of using
your own Makefiles.  You have built your module without kernel symbols
but the kernel was built with symbols, instant mismatch.  You almost
guarantee this sort of problem when you roll your own Makefile.  You
need to compile *exactly* the same way that the kernel was compiled so
why not hook your code into the kernel tree?
All you need to do is copy your code into the kernel tree as (say)
directory local, change the SUBDIRS line in the top level Makefile to
include local and use a Linux style Makefile in local (take a look at
net/ipv4/Makefile as an example).  Then make modules will build your
module exactly the same way as the kernel and all the other modules
were built.  local can even be a symlink to your own directory.
