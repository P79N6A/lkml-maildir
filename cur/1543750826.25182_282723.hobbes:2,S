That's not the problem, since function and definition are in the same 
module.
You didn't send your .config, but looking at the code it seems 
CONFIG_PM=n was the culprit.
As a workaround, it should work after enabling the following option:
  Power management options (ACPI, APM)
    Power Management support
This is only a workaround, I've Cc'ed the ALSA maintainers for a real 
fix.
