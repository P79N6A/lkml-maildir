Has anyone ported the compaq/hp Proliant health drivers to 
the 2.6 kernel? 
Thanks to Kianusch Sayah Karadji, I have a nice build script 
http://www.sk-tech.net/support/HPrpm2deb.sh.html
 
But these cpqhealth modules only work for 2.4 kernels. 
The driver source is available from 
ftp.compaq.com/pub/products/servers/supportsoftware/linux/ 
hpasm-7.1.0-xx.xxx.i386.rpm 
The modules that need to be ported from2.4 to 2.6 are 
opt/compaq/cpqhealth/{cmhp,cqpasm,cpqevt} 
 
 
-thanks in advance.
