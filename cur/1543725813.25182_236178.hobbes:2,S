Is my manpages too old?  I studied it for arp at least half an hour 
without seeing any way out of the dilemma short of a reboot, so I 
did.  And I just checked, theres no linkage from arp to anything 
called 'ip'.  Wrecked a 78 day uptime :(
Yes, I learned something from your message, thank you very much, but 
why is it so deeply buried?
Humm, is there not an option that will a: flush, and then b: refresh 
itself just as if its been rebooted?  The 'replace' appears to 
require intimate knowledge of a 48 bit MAC address etc I'd assume.
