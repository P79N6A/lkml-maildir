My usual algorithm here is to
1: queue all the patches and send the ones which have a maintainer to
   that maintainer until he merges it.
2: If the patches have a dependency upon (say) a VFS patch then I'll
   merge the VFS patch and will then goto 1.
I don't think this particular patch has a VFS depencency so sure, merge
away.  You'll probably see that I merged it anyway, but I'll drop it again
when I see it turn up in your tree (I used to resync with the git trees
at least daily, but I now do this far less frequently because it is such
torture because everyone is paddling in everyone else's puddle).
