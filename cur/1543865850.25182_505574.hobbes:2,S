Yes, it's weird; e.g. it seems that reports of that on linux1394-user
and -devel came in only recently. But I may have missed something.
(OTOH, this bug was partially hidden for FireWire users because one of
the relevant FireWire drivers was lacking respective _sync_sg calls.)

sync_single() definitely wants a virtual address there. sg->dma_address
is a physical address. The bug and the fix are obvious.
Unfortunately an author of lib/swiotlb.c chose to call many variables
holding *virtual* addresses "dma_addr". Note how that file at the same
time contains variables like "dma_addr_t dma_handle". A recipe for disaster.

Maybe some recent changes elsewhere cause more frequent use of
swiotlb-driven bounce buffers? That should be verified.
Or maybe people are deploying affected hardware more often now?
