The only thing I'd add is some pointers to setting up the target box 
with NFS root. In my setup for driver development both my x86 and ppc 
target boxes are diskless. The x86 boots using etherboot on a floppy, 
and the ppc has network booting in the rom.  I just compile a new kernel 
on the development box, copy it into my /tftpboot directory, and hit the 
reset button on the target. No mess, no fuss, no fsck.
