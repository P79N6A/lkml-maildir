I don't think there is any reason for such a restriction.
If you happen to make a partition with an odd number of sectors
and someone creates a filesystem there with 2-sector blocks
then the last sector will not be used by the filesystem.
Nothing wrong there, happens all the time.

Yes.
(Especially if your hard sector size is 512 bytes.
I have seen people complain about 2048-byte hard sector size handling.)
