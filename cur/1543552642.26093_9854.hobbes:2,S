I'm getting __alloc_pages: 7-order allocation failed.
all the time in 2.4.0-test9 on my "pIII (Katmai)".. kernel's
compiled with 2.95.2 + bounds, without -fbounds-checking
also of note is that I get:
LDT allocated for cloned task!
quite a bit as well.. It doesn't seem to be doing any harm, but it's
probably not supposed to be happening either :/
