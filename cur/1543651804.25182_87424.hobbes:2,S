Trying out 2.5, I've got only a partially working mouse.  The usb
mouse is fully functional, as are both sets of buttons on the
notebook.  The mouse pad works, but the nib is ignored.
Of course, I only ever use the nib and only noticed that the pad was
working by accident.
I seem to recall a similar post some time back, but cannot find it in
my archives.  
Any ideas?
I do need to reboot into 2.4 and clone my bk clone from the sbp2 disk
to the internal disk (ohci1394 is b0rked ATM) to see the .config I
ended up with....
The relevant X config is:
Section "ServerFlags"
  Option       "AllowMouseOpenFail"
EndSection
Section "InputDevice"
  Driver       "mouse"
  Identifier   "Mouse[1]"
  Option       "Device" "/dev/psaux"
  Option       "InputFashion" "Mouse"
  Option       "Name" "AutoDetected"
  Option       "Protocol" "ps/2"
  Option       "Vendor" "AutoDetected"
  Option       "Emulate3Buttons" "on"
EndSection
Section "InputDevice"
  Driver       "mouse"
  Identifier   "USBmouse"
  Option       "Device" "/dev/input/mice"

  Option       "Protocol" "IMPS/2"
  Option       "Vendor" "AutoDetected"
  Option       "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
EndSection
