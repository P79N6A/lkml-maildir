Given that ext2resize, Partition Magic and others have been mentioned
here, I thought I would pass along this freshmeat entry:

PartEd's README:
GNU parted is a program for creating, destroying, resizing, checking and
copying partitions, and the filesystems on them.
GNU parted was designed to minimize the chance of data loss.  For
example, it was designed to avoid data loss during interruptions (like
power failure) and performs many safety checks.  However there could be
bugs in Parted, so you should back up your important files.
