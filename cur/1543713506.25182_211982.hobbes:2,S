Ah your thinking of the days when 1 meg of memory was a lot and LISP was 
considered huge..  With 4 gigs of memory today, it shouldnt be a problem 
:). Actually a LISP vm can fit into a small amount of memory depending 
on what you want it to do... 
I think in the end, this is a 'When all you know is to hammer, 
everything is a nail.' They know LISP.
