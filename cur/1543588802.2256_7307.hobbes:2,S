I recompiled the kernel with isapnp-support and statically compiled
driver. I then typed aha1542=0x330 at the lilo prompt, but the card
wasn't
recognized (see dmesg_pnp_bootparam.txt on 
http://schabi.de/scsi/
).
isapnp will initialize the card when the check entry is removed, but
doesn't activate the driver. I'll next test with modularized driver, and
the isapnp tools.
