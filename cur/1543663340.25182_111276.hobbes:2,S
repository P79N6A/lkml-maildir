Actually I think I have strong reason to have it in struct socket. I'll reply to
Dave's email and explain it there.

The thing is that once those processes are killed sockets will be 
destroyed and release the module anyway. i.e. There is no reason to
sort of artificially force accept() to fail. Everything will be cleaned 
up once the process is gone.

Yes that'd be wrong. However I think in general when module wants to create 
a copy of its own object (ie already holds reference) it should be able to 
copy the object and simply bump refcount with module_get(). That will help 
to avoid a lot of unnecessary error recovery paths (like in the accept() case).

Yep. And I'd argue in for of module_get() :)
Thanks
