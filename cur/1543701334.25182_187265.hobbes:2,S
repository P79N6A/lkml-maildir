Suppose we would like to overcome these perpetual problems with misbehaving
manufacturers by designing a PCI network card from scratch in the soul of
free source hardware.
What are the requirements of the kernel for such a card to be cool instead of
piece of shit? How should such a card behave from PCI point of view, should it
support scatter, gather, how should interrupts be handled, what should be
programmable and what not? How should be busmastering implemented?
I am seriously thinking about designing something like that (tailored specially
for Linux) because of developping Ronja - if I included native Ronja support in
"my" network card, I could remove the superfluous circuits that implement
"bureaucracy" linke autonegotiation, TP link integrity etc. and concentrate on
raw performance. Also multiple ports could be on one card (say 4) which would
make the whole thing more nifty.
I have made to work the whole design chain from schematic design to production
of raw files for PCB manufacturers. Also seen a design of video capture
board for IDE connector so I judge implementing something on a PCI should'n
be a pain in the ass higher than moderate.
Is it possible to obtain some PCI specs without NDA's and such bullshit?
Is here anyone who has taken the PCI specs and rewritten them in their
own words?
