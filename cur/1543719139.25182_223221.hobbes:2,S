Hi
I have applied the patch and my system is now stable even when heavy network 
traffic appears. I enabled NAPI for the card. The network througput is still 
a bit low (~12MB/s) but I guess this is due to the unpatched endpoint which 
is also rtl8169 because bonnie told me both harddrives of the computers are 
capable of more than that.
System temperature dropped by 13° (from 55°) when idle for those interested in 
test results.
Thanx for help
Jens
