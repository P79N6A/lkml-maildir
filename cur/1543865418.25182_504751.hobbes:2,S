I've never had this device work 100% with MSI on any kernel version I've 
tested so far. But I'm not the original reporter of the problem, and I 
believe for him it was a true regression where a previous kernel wored 
correctly.
The behavior I observe on 2.6.19 is better than 2.6.20-rc7. Link status 
interrupts seem to work but rx/tx does not. A few more details here:

I'm going to test 2.6.16 thru 2.6.20-rc7 this weekend and will report 
back any variations in behavior I notice.
