Since no one seems to have any ideas, could someone please tell me (or
link to the docs) of what I need to capture next time this happens? 
It's been pretty consistent from 2.4.18-ac4 to 2.4.22 so I'm figuring
the problem still isn't resolved in 2.4.23.  I've been checking
changelogs and nothing looks relevant.
Thanks,
Dale Blount
