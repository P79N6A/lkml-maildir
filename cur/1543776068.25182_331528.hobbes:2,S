mount --bind.  Is there a performance hit for having too many of those?
mount --bind /meta/vfs/some/chroot /some/chroot/meta
Also, maybe a separately-mounted /meta, maybe with something like
'-o root='
I can't think of when you'd have a chrooted application that uses /meta, 
but wasn't written with /meta in mind, so as to have these mount 
commands in its init scripts.
