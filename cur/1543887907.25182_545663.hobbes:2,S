this line is invalid; you are not allowed to dereference userspace
memory directly. You need to call copy_from_user() on stp first, and
then use the copy.

Also suppose that the call to foo on line 7  takes a non-trivial amount of time to execute. During the time it takes foo to execute, the user application writes a kernel address to stp->u. Note that this write occurs after the check on line 5. Then, on line 8, the kernel writes to stp->u which contains a kernel address. So, the user application could force the kernel to overwrite itself. Is it possible to exploit this race condition? If so, does Sparse check for this?
