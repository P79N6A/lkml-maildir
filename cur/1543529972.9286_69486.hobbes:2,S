Linux is written to compile with GCC, and in fact, relies on some of
GCC's features and quirks. This is a conscious and intentional
decision, and not very limiting. The parts that are worth optimizing in a
port to that architecture have probably already been optimized by hand.
(ie, if 90% of execution is spent in 1% of code, you can bet that the 1%
will be hand optimized).
Linux is ported to new platforms by getting GCC to run on the platform's
native OS first, or alternatively, cross-compiling to that platform on
your established (GCC'd) platform.
Hope this helps.
