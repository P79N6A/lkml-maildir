Your patch moved a bunch of code into asm-i386/rwsem_xchgadd.h.  That 
code was derived from the spinlock code by me into the first rwsems, 
then David reworked bits of it, as wel as you.  But there is no 
copyright on that file indicating this heritage.  If you look at 
how strict commercial copyright control can be, even copying a 
single line of code mentally by retyping it can still mandate the 
copyright legacy.  I'm sure it's just an oversight, but it's 
probably one we *all* need to be reminded of every now and again.
