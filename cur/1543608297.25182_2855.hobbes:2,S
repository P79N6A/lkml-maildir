Aha.  Like, say it, /proc/kcore.  Or /proc/mounts, yodda, yodda.
	Noble idea, but there is a little problem: random massive userland
breakage.  E.g. changing /proc/mounts is going to hit getmntent(3), etc.
	If you are willing to audit all userland code - you are welcome.
But keep in mind that standard policy is to keep obsolete API for at least
one stable branch with warnings and remove it in the next one.  So we are
talking about 2.8 here.  BTW, I'm less than sure that your variant is free
of rmmod races, but that's a separate story...
