Subject: IDE/SCSI emulation kills machine when using CD-Rom.

Perhaps someone else out there in the enlightened world of Linux Kernel
development can help me figure this one out.  I've got 2 CD-Roms installed in
this machine right now; a Toshiba XM-6202B and a Panasonic CW-7582 Writer. 
I've managed to get the IDE/SCSI driver working, and can access the Panasonic
writer beautifully, works like a charm.  However, whenever I try to do
anything with the Toshiba drive mount or read raw data, it kills the machine. 
Playing audio CDs works fine in the Toshiba, but I can't access it as a CD-Rom
any more.  Yes, I've tried accessing it as any combination of /dev/hdb, sg0,
sr0, scd0 and none of them worked.  I do end up with the following information
dumped into my /var/log/messages file, I'm hoping someone can help me figure
out why this thing isn't working any more (it works fine if I recompiled
_without_ ide-scsi emulation).  Currently running 2.1.131-ac11, but have had
this problem on all kernels since 2.1.28 (which was the first kernel I ever
tried running ide-scsi on).
As for other info on this machine, it's a K6 233Mhz, running on an Asus P5A-B
motherboard.  I've also got the ALI15x3 UDMA patch installed, and have
/dev/hda running in UDMA mode.  Toshiba used to be /dev/hdb, and the Panasonic
writer used to be /dev/hdc.
sr0: disc change detected.
