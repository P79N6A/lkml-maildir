If someone calls __vmalloc in atomic context (with GFP_ATOMIC flags):
with 2.6.17-rc4, in file mm/vmalloc.c,
__vmalloc calls __vmalloc_node on line 484,
__vmalloc_node calls get_vm_area_node on line 474,
get_vm_area_node calls __get_vm_area_node on line 256,
__get_vm_area_node calls kmalloc_node with GFP_KERNEL on line 180
and in include/linux/slab.h,
kmalloc_node calls kmalloc with GFP_KERNEL on line 164,
kmalloc calls kmem_cache_alloc on line 106,
and in mm/slab.c,
kmem_cache_alloc calls __cache_alloc on line 3136,
__cache_alloc calls cache_alloc_debugcheck_before on line 2880,
cache_alloc_debugcheck_before calls might_sleep_if(GFP_KERNEL & GFP_WAIT)
on line 2783
which causes the warning.
