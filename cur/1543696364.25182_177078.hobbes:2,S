an IPI creates quite some overhead both on the source and on the target
CPU, so i think it's definitely worth this extra check. Also, with
increasingly higher load it's increasingly more likely that we can skip
the IPI (because the task might be on the runqueue but it is not
executing), so further increasing the load via additional IPIs is the
wrong answer.
