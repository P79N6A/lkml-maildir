lxr is pretty good (glimpse on its own as well can be useful). If you
don't want to set it up yourself, then you could consider to use the
online version at

Another good thing is "make ctags" in the kernel source dir - this
will  let you quickly jump to declarations etc and back with a few
simple keystrokes in editors like vim.

"make cscope" is another good option. It'll generate an index usable
by the cscope tool (

).
