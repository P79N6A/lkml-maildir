yes.  i reasoned that the dev parameter isn't really adding any useful
randomness, so i left it out of my original function.  i've done a few
benchmarks to test the hypothesis, and, by-and-large, the hash functions
without "dev" seemed to work a little better.
if you want to add it back, i suggest this:
	((((unsigned long) (minor(dev) + (block)) * MULTIPLIER) >> 11) &
		bh_hash_mask)
