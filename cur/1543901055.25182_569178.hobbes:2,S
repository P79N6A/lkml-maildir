Subject: [PATCH] slob: reduce list scanning
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/14/11

The version of SLOB in -mm always scans its free list from the
beginning, which results in small allocations and free segments
clustering at the beginning of the list over time. This causes the
average search to scan over a large stretch at the beginning on each
allocation.
By starting each page search where the last one left off, we evenly
distribute the allocations and greatly shorten the average search.
Without this patch, kernel compiles on a 1.5G machine take a large
amount of system time for list scanning. With this patch, compiles are
within a few seconds of performance of a SLAB kernel with no notable
change in system time.
