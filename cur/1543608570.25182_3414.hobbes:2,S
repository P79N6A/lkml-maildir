Hmmmm. If someone would be able to implement new architecture which can
provide 1:1 sysctl/procfs support, there would be need for user space
programs parse proc filesystem. Then, /proc would be only good to administrators
to echo to/cat entries. So compatibility with old design can remain, and
new programs would be able to use the much more versatile sysctl support.
OK, it's a hard guess only. ;-)
