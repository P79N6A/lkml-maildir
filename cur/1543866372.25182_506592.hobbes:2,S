> Adds call forwarding to X.25, allowing it to operate like an X.25 router.
> Useful if one needs to manipulate X.25 traffic with tools like tc.
> This is an update/cleanup based off a patch submitted by Daniel Ferenci a few years ago.

> Thanks Alan for the feedback.
> Added the null check to the clones.
