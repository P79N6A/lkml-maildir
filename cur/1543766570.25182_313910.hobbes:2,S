I have vague memories of this being discussed at some length last year. 
Nothing comprehensive came of it, except that perhaps the kdump code should
spin with irqs off for a couple of seconds so the DMA and IRQs stop.
(Ongoing DMA is not a problem actually, because the kdump kernel won't be
using that memory anyway)

For kdump we really don't want to be doing fancy driver shutdown inside a
crashed kernel.  It would be better to just jump to the new kernel and
to reset the hardware from there.  DMA doesn't matter, and maybe IRQs can
be handled with a sustained local_irq_disable() (hard).
But for the normal kexec path, yes, graceful device shutdown is desirable.
So the requirements for the two different kexec scenarios are quite
different and it seems unlikely that any single approach to device shutdown
will suit both situations.
