We have a bootloader that loads a kernel, then loads another kernel. 
Without the reboot handler, we get weird behavior, and SCSI that does not
initialize properly for the second kernel.  It may not be useful to
everyone, but it is essential to some.

I appreciate your concern on this.   I'll re-examine the timer stuff, and
if possible, I'd like to get to agreement ASAP, so we can X it off our list
of changes.
