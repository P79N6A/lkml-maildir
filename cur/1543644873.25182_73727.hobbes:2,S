Actually, a value of zero doesn't sound completely silly to me, right
now, since I have been doing a lot of thinking about video capture
recently.
How much is it going to hurt a filesystem like ext[23] if that value is
set to zero while doing large streaming writes -- something like
(almost) uncompressed video at ten to twenty meg a second, for
gigabytes?
This is a situation where, for a dedicated machine, delaying reads
almost forever is actually a valuable thing. At least, valuable until it
stops the writes from being able to proceed.
