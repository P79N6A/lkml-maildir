There's a generalization which should confuse novice users... correctly 
used a timeout IS a debugging technique. Useful to detect when a peer 
has gone walkabout, as a common example.
Sounds as if the timeout is way too low here, however. Perhaps they are 
using it as poorly-done polling? In any case, not kernel misbehaviour.
