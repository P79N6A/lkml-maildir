That requires code in every driver. Duplicated, hard to write, likely to
be racey code. Thats bad.
The bigger picture really should be
ACPI etc	"I want to suspend to disk"
PM layer
		Suspend the non I/O tasks (btw reminds me - eh tasks and
			all workqueues may be I/O tasks at times)
		Complete all the block I/O queues
		Throw out the pages we can evict
		Write suspend image
		Jump to PM layer "power off" logic
If you do it that way up then no drivers need to be hacked about.
