I run 2.3.15 on a UP PPro, with pppd 2.3.9.  Recently I've been getting
errors like:
Aug 30 10:17:59 telomere kernel: unregister_netdevice: Old style device
ppp0 leaked(refcnt=2). Wait for crash. 
Now I got another error (which could just be the result of the first
error occuring before) that might be useful:
Aug 30 10:19:09 telomere kernel: KERNEL: assertion (dev->ip_ptr==NULL)
failed at dev.c(1861):netdev_finish_unregister 
Aug 30 10:19:19 telomere pppd[376]: pppd 2.3.9 started by root, uid 0
Aug 30 10:19:19 telomere kernel: unregister_netdevice: Old style device
ppp0 leaked(refcnt=-2). Wait for crash. 
Aug 30 10:19:19 telomere pppd[376]: Using interface ppp0
Aug 30 10:19:19 telomere pppd[376]: local  IP address 10.0.0.1
