Hi,
I am having an old Pentium 120, with an old BIOS.
I got new 40GB hard disk, and in order to make it readable, I needed to
use the cable-select jumper in order to make the hard disk look smaller
for the bios.
The only problem is that the linux recognizes my hard drive as 33GB (maybe
its 32 as you said). will what you said about disabling the hard disk
recognision at the BIOS help me?
I don't want to play with the BIOS for nothing, so please let me know.
 Thanks,
   Ido
