__deprecated has spread to just about every API that people don't 
consider fresh and up-to-date.
Like I noted in the patch description, rewriting grotty ISA/MCA/etc. 
probe code is a thankless, boring task that few are crazy enough to 
attempt :)
As you can see from the patch flood recently I /have/ been working 
through the dud code, but it will still take years.  The changes 
required for each are on average ~200 LOC changed, if not more.
But regardless...  I don't see any reason to force every kernel build to 
remind us of grotty drivers.  Where's the benefit?  Everybody knows they 
are grotty.
Like __must_check this option defaults to the current state of things -- 
warnings -- so you have to take an extra step to turn them off.
