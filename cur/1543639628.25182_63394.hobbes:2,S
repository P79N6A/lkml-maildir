Sorry for the delay in responding... I'm on travel and was
disconnected for a while there.

I can't find this string anywhere in my source tree... I also looked
through the alim15x3.c code and didn't see anything like it.  So the
bit you have below doesn't seem to be protected by a #ifdef.
I haven't had the chance to do a recompile and reboot, but I will let
you know when I do.  By the way, there used to be a patch (which I've
attached) floating around the Fujitsu P-series community which
essentially disabled the writes to config byte 0x79 (which the
comments say is related to the southbridge).  The other workaround
people used was passing 'ide0=ata66 ide1=ata66' on the command line.
Anyway, I'll let you know if it works as soon as I get a chance to
test it.
