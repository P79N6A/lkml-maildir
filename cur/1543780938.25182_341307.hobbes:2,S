What are the portability and scaling issues if it were done this way? It 
clearly looks practical on x86 uni, but if we want per-CPU non-tick, I'm 
less sure how it would work.
But when you go to non-x86 hardware, is there always going to be another 
source of wakeup available if the PIT is blocked instead of reset? I 
have to go back and look at how SPARC hardware works, I don't remember 
enough to be useful.
