That might be the idea, but that's not the implementation:

I think there is currently no implementation for "ordered read" except
rmb():
- multiple atomic_read()'s don't enforce read ordering.
- there are set_?mb() function, but there are no get_?mb() functions.
I've read that rmb() is expensive on RISC architectures, what about
adding "get_?mb()" functions?
