It means that the disk is slow and the CPU is fast... so while the disk
is busy seeking and reading data the CPU has nothing to do but wait for
it.
Idle == CPU has nothing to do
Waiting == CPU has nothing to do, but it will have as soon as the slow
	disk (or whatever) delivers data
Anyway 97% is quite high... what CPU / Hard Disk do you have?
What kernel version?
I/O scheduler? (cat /sys/block/DEVICE/queue/scheduler)
Filesystem?
And what time of "operations" are you doing?
