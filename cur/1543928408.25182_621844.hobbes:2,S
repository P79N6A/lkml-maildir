i've resolved those and i've added your 27 patches to x86.git. You can 
pick it up from the 'mm' branch of x86.git:
 git-pull git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git mm
it builds and boots fine here, and the patches certainly look very 
clean. Unless there are major problems with it this looks like 2.6.25 
stuff. Would you mind to send updates/fixes against this tree?
