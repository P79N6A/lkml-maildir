is it necessary to prevent collisions between kernel pages and process
pages, or doesn't that matter?  if you allocate by adding the pid to the
address, do you just make up an arbitrary pid when allocating for the
kernel?  i'm pretty new to this, so please excuse if this is an obvious
question.
(btw, i'm in favor of an efficient always-on algorithm, as described here)
