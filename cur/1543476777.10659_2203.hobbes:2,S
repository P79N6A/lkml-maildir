I've been routinely building 2.1 kernels with egcs snapshots starting
january 1998 or so, no particular troubles. Just some hickups when one of
the december snapshots of egcs finally outlawed broken asm()s on ia32,
promptly fixed in Alan Cox's patchsets
<
ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/alan/>,
 and now also in the latest
2.2.0-pre sets. I'm now runnning 2.2.0-pre6 compiled with egcs-19981216
(egcs-19990103 doesn't boostrap here due to compiler breakage with
glibc-2.1 snapshots) and binutils-2.9.1.0.19a

I don't think so, but YMMV. Check it out! If something fails, many people
will try to fix the kernel or get the compiler fixed.
