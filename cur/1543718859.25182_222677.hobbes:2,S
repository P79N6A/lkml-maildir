So: we can use the flags, but we cannot return the errors.

This is, as I mentioned, only for testing.  It is, clearly, NOT ordinary
system behavior at all since we don't, and won't, return the error. 
Some people find it very convenient to have this available, but if the
opinion is that it is better to let development teams manage their own
testing infrastructure that is acceptable to me.
