Subject: how to tell linux (on x86) to ignore 1M or memory

I need to preserve some state from the bios before entering protected
mode.  For now I want to copy it into some ram accessible by real-mode,
say the last megabyte visible in real-mode.
What's the easiest way to have linux ignore the megabyte starting at 15M?
Cheers,
