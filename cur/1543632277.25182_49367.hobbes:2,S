I hope you're wrong, because that does not sound reasonable.  On the other
hand, the two build systems coexist quite happily in the same tree.  You
have to explicitly do the -f Makefile-2.5 for the new build system to kick
in.  So nobody is being asked to make any sudden change, people can convert
at their own convenience.

If that's really a correct interpretation, it would be weird.  I hope it
isn't.
