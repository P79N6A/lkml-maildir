This is a very good point, Arnd and I have been looking at our "mem=" hack
and it does look a little bit fishy...
There are possibly more things affected in the s390 kernel with "mem="
parameter, not only num_physpages (max_low_pfn, etc.), so we will have to
take a closer look and see what Martin thinks about it.

This patch is o.k. for us, in our case (with "mem=") it would more or less
restore the previous situation (without the calculation, but still with a
potential memory problem on our side)
