but when I try to compile in the Bluetooth subsystem I got the following
error:
net/built-in.o: In function `sock_init':
net/built-in.o(.text.init+0x5b): undefined reference to `bluez_init'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
It seems like that I have missed some magic to understand, because
"wanrouter_init" is also not declared static. But for netfilter or
netlink init it seems to work this way. Can you please give me some
infos how to fix this the right way.
Regards
Marcel
