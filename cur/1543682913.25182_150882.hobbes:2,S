Any ideas if this is going to be fixed for 2.6?  I think this is a show
stopper, certainly for embedded devices - a fair number of people do use
CF cards in their embedded solutions, and some of us hotplug CF cards to
grab images off our digital cameras.
I've had people at KS/OLS approach me about this issue in both 2.4 and
2.6 kernels.
