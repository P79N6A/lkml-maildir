That's more like it, thanks.
I've seen this before, but I can never reproduce it. Not with i386, nor
with sparc64, and not running 2.4 or 2.6. I know what is happening
though. The response packet is getting processed before the status
packet (IOW, the ack for your request is getting back after the actual
response to your request).
Not sure how that is possible, but I suspect it's just a bit of logic
that needs to be applied, or queue the replies waiting for the ack.
