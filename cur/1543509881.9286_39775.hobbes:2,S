Hi all, 
	I am not very sure if this is the right forum to approach. If it is not i
would very much appreciate if someone could point me towards one.
	I am using Redhat5.0 and everything is fine with 2.1.90. When i use 2.1.26
however, during reboot it gives error message "SCSI bus being reset on host
0" and is unable to get past this state. I am using ADAPTEC 2940 UW. 
	However theres is no problem with 2.1.126 in a couple of other machines i
have. The only difference i notice is that the adaptec card defaults to
40MB/sec,  maximum sync transfer rate in the "good" machines while in the
"bad" ones it is 20MB/sec. I cant change it to 40 as then the disk is no
longer recognized. However, if i use the adaptec card from the machine in
the good ones, i get "operating system not found" and if I use the "bad"
cards in the good one it gives the SCSI reset problem appears in those
machines too with 2.1.126. Theres however no problems with 2.1.90 in all
the cases. 
	Is this transfer rate related to the access time of the disk. Need i
change the disk in order to install 2.1.126 or is there some other way out.
	Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Thanks much.
