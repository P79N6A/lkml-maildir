I just checked one oracle system and it did not lock the memory. And I
do not think that the other databases do it by default either.
And our application server doesn't do it definitely. And it uses loads
of shared memory. We will have application servers soon with 16 GB
memory at customer sites which will have the whole memory in shmfs.

Nobody should rely on shm swapping for productive use. But you have
changing/increasing loads on application servers and out of a sudden
you run oom. In this case the system should behave and it is _very_
good to have a smooth behaviour. 
Customers with performance problems very often start with too little
memory, but they cannot upgrade until this really big job finishes :-(
Another issue about shm swapping is interactive transactions, where
some users have very large contexts and go for a coffee before
submitting. This memory can be swapped.
