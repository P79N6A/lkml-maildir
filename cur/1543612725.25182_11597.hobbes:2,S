I have recently compiled the kernel 2.4.16 in a P2 running red hat 7.2.
I have a hp82xxxx so i made sure i selected the SCSI support, as well as SCSI 
cdrom support and tape support ( don't know why though ) and disk support all 
that stuff, but i compiled them as an integrated part of the kernel and not 
as modules!!!!
I Also selected usb mass storage support and stuff but that doesn't matter 
for now!!
Well the problem is:
whenever linux boots it trys to load the Scsi modules for the new kernel but 
it [ fails ], i figure this is because my previous had scsi as module and now 
it isn't a module but a integrated part of the kernel, so i turned off  the 
scsi from the service manager. ( don't know if i am right though ).
second, how do i make sure scsi support is actually running???
third, if scsi is running and if i have the usb mass storage built into the 
kernel, why doesn't my cd-rw appear listed  as a scsi connected device as it 
should??
regards, Astinus.
