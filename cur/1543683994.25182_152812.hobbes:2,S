I would argue the other way around. The majority of desktop users run X,
console blanking won't help them anyway. The server users tend to have KVM
or switch monitor cables on the fly - in most such cases console blanking
hurts more than helps (since you can't tell which box is connected to which
monitor etc.)
And console blanking is not real DPMS power save anyway.

Most times when you need to have it fixed is when your box has mysteriously
locked up, and you'd wan't to know if there was a oops on the screen. No can
do - the console is already blanked. By then it is too late to fix it.
In what cases is console blanking so hugely important these days, anyway?
