sorry for the late answer, I was not @home for one week.
Attached to my ide ports are :
on the primary channel : 1 ide disk,  QUANTUM FIREBALLP LM30
                         1 ide disk,  ST3491A
on the secondary channel : 1 cdrom reader, CREATIVECD3621E
                           1 cdrom burner, GoldStar CD-RW CED-8083B
The second HDD is not DMA
