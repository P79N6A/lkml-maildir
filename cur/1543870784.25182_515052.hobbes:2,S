That means that we bind very small object like timer or signal to the
whoe file structure - yes, as I stated - it is doable, but do we really
have to create a file each time create_timer() or signal() is called?
Signals as a filesystem are limited in that regard that we need to
create additional structures to have signal number<->private data
relations.
I designed kevent to be as small as possible, so I removed file binding
idea first. I do not say it is wrong or epoll (and threadlets) are broken 
(fsck, I hope people do understand that), but as is it can not handle
that scenario, so it must be extended and/or a lot of other stuff
written to be compatible with epoll design. Kevent has different design
(which allows to work with old one though - there is a patch to
implement epoll over kevent).
