By transparent I meant that the task _need_ not have to know that there
is a resource manager sitting and managing its resources. Task will
still see the effects of resource crunch etc., (but it will handle the
situation the same way as it would handle today).
So, it is transparent. A task don't have to know that the reclamation is
happening due to its affiliation to a resource group. Task will be
handling it as if there is a pressure for that particular resource.

Not for all resources, CPU could handle it very nicely, whereas memory
would be heavy. My point is that the infrastructure should be open, and
controller is the one that decides whether it wants to handle it or not.

Basically I was saying that even though resource management in container
and non-container have mostly same requirements, there are few
requirements that are critical in non-container scenario which are non-
issue in container scenario (for example, moving tasks from one resource
group to another).
In effect, Design of the infrastructure should not limit non-container
usages. 
IMO, non-container requirements are a superset of container requirements
(resource management purposes only :).

I think my point is not understood. I do not think it is right to add
_controller specific_ fields to the generic data structure (struct
user_beancounter), as we will end up with a generic data structure which
will have so many fields that are not used in so many controllers.

In non-container environment, there is _no_ /proc/pid/container, as
there is no concept of container :). This will be useful for non-
container scenario.
