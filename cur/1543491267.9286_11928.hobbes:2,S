This oops was discussed a while ago.  NTFS runs out of memory, and doesnt
check the kmalloc.  It was fixed by Steve Dodd and is in 2.2.3ac?, and i THINK
2.2.4.  The new version of NTFS (990323) also fixes this.
As far as NTFS running out of memory, to make it use memory more lightly would
require somewhat radical rewrites of much of the code, and probably won't come
soon... :(
