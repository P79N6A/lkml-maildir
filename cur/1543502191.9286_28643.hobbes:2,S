I've prepared a first patch (x86 only for now), which does what I have in
mind. It exports gettimeoffset() from arch/xx/kernel/time.c (only for x86
at the moment), never undersleeps on nanosleep (sleeps to the nearest tick
after timeout), and never oversleeps on select (sleeps to nearest tick
before timeout). I did some short tests to prove this, and it seems to
work. The basics are done in timespec_to_jiffies
There's a known flaw in my implementation: since timespec_to_jiffies just
provides a delta, the jiffies could have been incremented after I rounded
up, which gives an unnecessary tick to wait in that case. Rewriting that
so that timespec_to_jiffies adds jiffies itself (with taking overflows
into account) is more time-consuming; it's on my ToDo list.
A patch for other architectures where it is easy to port without testing
will follow, but for the more complicated parts (SPARC), I'll very likely
leave the challange of providing gettimeoffset() to the maintainers of
that platform ;-).
