>What is drbd?  An out of tree driver?  Did it work with 2.6.13-rcX?  If
Yes, it implements RAID 1 across two computers over a network link in 
realtime. Generally, you combine with a program called heartbeat to 
implement high-availabilty failover. It's very neat ;-)

It's actually working now. Don't ask me to explain it because last 
night and most of Monday I couldn't get it working and I must have 
compiled half a dozen different Gentoo kernel versions of 2.6.12, and 
it worked with some but not others. It worked perfectly with the 
official 2.6.12 but not with official 2.6.13. Then suddenly it just 
started to work again on all the Gentoo 2.6.12s it wouldn't work with 
and also with the official 2.6.13. I have 2.6.13 running right now, 
and drbd devices show up in /dev as if there never had been any 
problem.
