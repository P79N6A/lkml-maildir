Changelog:
LTP-20040707
- Added a new test for bind() written by Dan Jones.
- Jacky Malcles added support for ext3 and some cleanup code.
- Fixes to fix DMAPI defect
- Changes for eliminating dmapi.h
- Applied patch from Gary Williams to change malloc() to calloc() b/c some
  archs don't like the use of uninitialized memory.
- Fix typo and change i to a 1 in the bufcmp function in diotest_routines.c
- Applied patch from Gary Williams that added an optional forth arguement
to
 semctl as a union, not a pointer to pointer, b/c pointer to pointer causes
ppc
 to explode.  Union will automagically interpret the union as a pointer as
 necessary....now works on multiple archs.
- Made sure that the shm segment is cleaned up if the shmat() fails.
- Applied patch from Wu Zhou to correctly cleanup in case of a failure.
- Added definition for SHM_HUGETLB for cases where this is not defined.
- Applied patch from Steve Hill and Gary Williams for MIPS.
- Applied a timing fix to allow the test to run on more architectures.
- Applied results cleanup patch from Gary Williams.
- Corrected the logic in the test to use -lepoll or not.
- Applied PASS message cleanup patch from Gary Williams
- Fix invalid syntax "if undefined" in modify_ldt tests
- Applied patch from Gary Williams for personality() tests to initialize
  PER_LINUX so we can clearly see if the desired changes occur.
- Updated to Posixtestsuite-1.4.3
