The program is going to access at least one cache line of the new
page.  On my G5, it takes _less_ time to clear the whole page and pull
in one cache line from L2 cache to L1 than it does to pull in that
same cache line from memory.

It occurs just as often as we clear pages in the page fault handler.
We aren't clearing any fewer pages by prezeroing, we are just clearing
them a bit earlier.

I can believe that prezeroing could provide a benefit on some
machines, but I don't think it will provide any on ppc64.
