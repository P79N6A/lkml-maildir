Hi Alan,
I just got this email from SGI (from one of their engineers) regarding SGI
Visual Workstations:
So, I think that SGI Visual Workstation should be (sadly) removed from
kernel 2.3.x (and the final 2.4)
Comments?
Thanks
Hetz

I don't think that anyone is actively working on the VW port here at SGI.
There may be people in the field working on it -- I don't know.
In any case, SGI has no plans for Linux on the VW since we are no longer
selling it as a product (we were never selling linux on vw as a project --
there was a possibility, but that was killed in favor of standard x86
boxes)
