Where are the kernel calls defined for locks and semaphores?
How come the kernel headers don't define Posix.4 
semaphores (_POSIX_SEMAPHROES) or Posix itself
(_POSIX_VERSION is undefined)

System calls in general are for userspace.  Often, there exist alternate
entry points for kernel services, or other ways to do it (for instance,
the kernel has its own code for locks and semaphores).
