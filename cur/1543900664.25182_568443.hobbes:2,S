It looks like you included all bits we found in the previous runs, so
likely it will work good, but so far I have conflicts merging todays git
and your tree in include/linux/splice.h, fs/ext2/file.c, fs/splice.c and 
mm/filemap_xip.c. This can be a problem with my tree though.
It really looks like the last tree we tested, so if you think additional
one will not hurt, feel free to ping, so I will completely rebase
testing tree.
