Hmmm. Then have the watchdog reset the system as soon as it attempts
to boot? This is not my idea of a "good way". The usual way is to
read or write something to the watchdog's port to turn it off during
POST. Thereafter, after the first access to its port turns it back
on. A common WD timer is the Dallas Semiconductor DS1232. It sits at
0x878. Writing a 1 starts it, thereafter it must be written with a
bit 0,0, followed by a bit 0,1 to keep it from resetting. Since this
is a "system controller", i.e., a port that can be configured to do
whatever the designer wanted, this of course is machine dependent.
In this case, setting bit 7,1 turns it off, which also happens upon
reset.

I did. There may not be any other "safe" port. Writing to a port
that is not any anybody's hardware decode does nothing useful. You
need the hardware's bus activity to create the necessary delay.
