I have the same result here:
00:0e.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Rage XL (rev 27)
I was also surprised to notice that there is no support in X for FBDev 
with mach64 cards.  I was under the impression that they used to be 
common on older powermacs where the fbdev was essential.
I guess the place to check on the status is the linux-fbdev-devel list.
