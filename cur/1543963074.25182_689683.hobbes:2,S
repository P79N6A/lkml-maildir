Style is good, code looks clean
One big thing that needs fixing here is the function names. If the driver
gets linked into the kernel then the symbols become global - and names
like enableGPIO are asking for clashes. The viafb code is fine as it uses
viafb_ as the function names. Possibly the helper functions should doo
something similar.
We also have a generic i2c layer that might be usable but that is
something that could be addressed in the future and isn't really an
important detail.
