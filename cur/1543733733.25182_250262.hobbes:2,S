I was just following ioctl. 
And ioctl is the way it is because man IOCTL(2) defines ioctl as
  int ioctl(int d, int request, ...);
So I wander what goes on here- the syscall returns a long but
libc cuts the high 32 bit?
Now that I think about it,for compat if you start returning 0 in low
32 bits you are unlike to get the effect you wanted ...
The ioctl_native could be changed but that would make it impossible
for compatible ioctls to just use the same pointer in both.
So what do you think - should I make just the native ioctl a long,
or both, and document that the high 32 bit are cut in the compat call?

Would these be best fit in the header file itself, or in a new
Documentation/ file?

I'll go over it again. Something specific that I missed?
