Look around for patches from Keith Owens relating to this, and the
xircom_tulip_cb driver.  It needs a ROM image mapping into the address
space, which is normally not done without the special "pci=rom" setting
on the kernel command line.  Keith's patch, IIRC, temporary does a
mapping in order to get the necessary information from the ROM image.
