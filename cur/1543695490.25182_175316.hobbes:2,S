Note that the final one that made it into the kernel was slightly 
different, in that I worry about the fact that "psmouse_command" can 
change the source array, so I didn't do the "static" part (I know, I know, 
I looked up PSMOUSE_CMD_SETRATE and it has zero result bytes, but I 
decided to keep the patch minimal).
I also did the test for not-set in the caller, rather than change the rate 
setting itself.
