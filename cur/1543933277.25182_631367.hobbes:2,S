Well, you do realize that right now we have to have _users_ just doing 
"pci=nommconf" on the kernel command line, because we apparently don't do 
it aggressively enough?
The fact is, we simply don't know what the breakage is. The only safe 
situation is to just assume things are broken, and enable it only when 
necessary.
And if there isn't a driver that needs it, then it sure as *hell* isn't 
necessary.
