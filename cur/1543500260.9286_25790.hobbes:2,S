Sorry for losing the thread on this mail...
I have an SMP box with a spare partition on it.  I can do some testing
to try to find where this bug lies.  I also have a BT958 in here so I
can test SCSI stuff - though I saw that there was a typo in 2.2.10 in
the adaptec driver (0x40 instead of 0x04).  I don't use quotas and I
believe I haven't experienced corruption on any 2.2 kernel.  I say I
believe I haven't because pine complained about a sudden size difference
in my mailbox once when using 2.2.8 - but I never saw anything that
looked like corruption.  I am happy to test - are there specific configs
or tests you want me to run?
