No argument here - I think you're right, Neil.

Don't forget NFS client unstable pages.
FWIW, with writeback not being accounted as dirty, there is a window
in the NFS client where a page during writeback is not dirty or
unstable and hence not visible to the throttle. Hence if we have
lots of outstanding async writes to NFS servers, or their I/O
completion is held off, the throttle won't activate where is should
and potentially let too many pages get dirtied.
This may not be a major problem with the traditional small write
sizes, but with 1MB I/Os this could be a fairly large number of
pages that are unaccounted for a short period of time.

I disagree with the "throttle gently" bit there. If a process is
writing faster than the underlying storage can write, then you have
to stop the process in it's tracks while the storage catches up.
Especially if other processes are writing tothe same device. You
may as well just hit it with a big hammer becauses it's simple and
pretty effective.
Besides, it is difficult to be gentle when you can dirty memory at
least an order of magnitude faster than you can clean it.
Cheers,
Dave.
