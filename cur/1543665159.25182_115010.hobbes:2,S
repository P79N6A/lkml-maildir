Tried  with  a  Realtek  8139B and the Intel Pro100+ adapter. The same
thing   happens.   The   LAN   goes  crazy  and all programs trying to
access or use the LAN on the Linuxbox goes super-slow or crashes.
I am rather lost when it comes to where I should begin to look.
Have not compiled in IPX, network filtering and most other things. The
only  network  card  I  have compiled in is the Rtl8139 and the Becker
Intel Pro100+ driver.
Here is my net config:

I  have  not compiled in ACPI or APM or APIC. And they are disabled in
BIOS too.
