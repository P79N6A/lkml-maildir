I don't know if this is because of my hardware but:
- using fbset to change screen resolution of my vesafb doesn't work 
(ioctl FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO)
-using an svgalib application (eg: quake2) results in a black screen or 
sometimes random lines moving on the screen with a vesafb mode: 
800x600x8
 another resolution (1024x768x16) with the svgalib results in monitor 
switching in invalid resolution and keyboard lockup. And if i switch 
to an xfree86 server after killing the svgalib app. this results in 
system reboot.
