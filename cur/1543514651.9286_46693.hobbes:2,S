Could I try a couple of guesses?
Guess number 1:
---------------
In my opinion, some commercial company only wanted to implement mirroring
and so they didn't make the effort to design and implement RAID as a
generic kernel feature where mirroring is just a profile for this RAID
facility. It might well have happended they did the thing at the kernel
place it was easiest for them to implement it.
Result might be that they now have to deal with some legacy that
unfortunately donnot accomodate the layering of Linux RAID design and
implementation.
Guess number 2:
---------------
Someone just missed that Linux has support for mirroring. ;-)
