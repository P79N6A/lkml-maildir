Nice try, but I'm seeing it on a RedHat 9-ish laptop with this card:
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV17 [GeForce4 440 Go] (rev a3)
using XFree86 4.3.0 and the binary NVidia 4191 driver.  I hadn't posted because
I figured it was an NVidia problem and tainted  quite thoroughly.
Another data point:  I *dont* see this sort of freeze if I start it with
'NvAGP=1' (use internal agp), but I *do* see it with 'NvAGP=2' or '3'
(which tell it to use the kernel 'agpgart' code).
Sorry Dave, looks like a bug in AGP....
