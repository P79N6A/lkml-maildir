None, other than slightly enlarging the kernel with some
suspend/resume stuff we don't care about.  It's always been
unavailable for SN2 builds:
depends on IA64_GENERIC || IA64_DIG || IA64_HP_ZX1 || IA64_HP_ZX1_SWIOTLB
but there doesn't appear to be any particular reason for that other
than us not needing it (and in fact SN2 systems can run IA64_GENERIC
kernels with CONFIG_PM enabled without incident).

Sounds good to me.  Does that mean everything currently controlled by
CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT will be controlled by CONFIG_ACPI instead?
