Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Update feature-removal-schedule.txt
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Add pm_has_noirq_stage to feature-removal-schedule as part of the 
/sys/devices/.../power/state removal. Also note that this functionality 
won't be removed until alternative functionality is implemented, in 
order to avoid having this argument again in July.
