You completely miss my point.
You wrongly (and loudly) blamed Dmitry for something you broke yourself.
And if I hadn't stopped you pointing to what actually was broken you 
might have annoyed Dmitry until he'd have merged your wrong patch.
I don't claim any knowledge about scheduler or x86 internals, but I 
claim that I might be the person with the second-best understanding
of our kconfig files.
And I'd really prefer being able to take some time searching for a 
correct solution over having to quickly defeat the mess you create
as I had here.
