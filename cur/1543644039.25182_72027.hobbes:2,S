That doesn't solve the problem, does it? If you have two devices w/o
serial they could look like one with multipath, with the change you note
that is prevented by making a single multipath device w/o serial look like
two. I have visions of programs using /dev/st0 and /dev/st1, having used
backup programs which grabbed every drive with a tape ready.
It is indeed a messy problem.
