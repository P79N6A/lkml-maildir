How is it ever possible? The whole idea of throttling is to remove such
situation, and now you say it can not be solved. If limit is for 1gb of
pending block io, and system has for example 2gbs of ram (or any other
resonable parameters), then there is no way we can deadlock in
allocation, since it will not force page reclaim mechanism.
