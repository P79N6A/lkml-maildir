For my HP 8100 nothing has changed in 2.2.0-final.
The first problem - insmod hangs with multi-lun probing enabled - is still
there:
root@roos:~>modprobe ide-scsi
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
scsi : 1 host.
  Vendor: HP        Model: CD-Writer+ 8100   Rev: 1.0g
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
scsi0 channel 0 : resetting for second half of retries.
SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 2, scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 1 Request Sense 20 00 00 10 00
root@roos:~>mount /mnt/cdrom/
Detected scsi CD-ROM sr0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
(and here insmod hangs in D state while loading sr_mod). Disabling
multilun probing helps as a workaround.
The other problem - after using scsi generic with cdrecord, the driver is
confused and when loading sr_mod in this state it shows random garbage as
cd drive info - is also still there. I remember having  a crash in this
confused state too but I can't reproduce it any more. I'm ejecting and
reinsering the cd as a workaround so this problem is not fatal.
scsi dumps are available on request. Gadi Oxman suspected this is a
problem with enabling/disabling command translation.
