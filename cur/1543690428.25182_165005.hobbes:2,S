Well, this machine which my test passes (this is run on a kernel with
the work-around in, but since it detected the write buffer works, does
not activate it.)
Processor       : StrongARM-110 rev 2 (v4l)
never reports problems with the write buffer, and produces a consistent
set of results:

VM page alias coherency test: failed; will use copy buffers instead
And then there's ARM920T, and this is run on a kernel without
the work-around:

It's relatively simple, and I'm not sure why its causing such
misunderstanding.  Let me try one more time:
ARM caches are VIVT.  VIVT caches have inherent aliasing issues.  The
kernel works around these issues by marking memory uncacheable where
appropriate, and will continue to do so for VIVT cached ARM CPUs.
Separate issue: Some StrongARM-110 devices contain buggy write buffers.
For these devices, we need to do a little bit extra than we currently
do to ensure that they are coherent, by disabling the write buffer as
well as the cache for these regions.  Current kernels do not work
around this issue.
