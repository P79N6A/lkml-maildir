	Not necessarily. The code doesn't do much other than modified shared data
without a lock. Not only does this invoke undefined behavior, but it
penalizes SMP machines because only they are subject to cache ping-ponging.

	The program doesn't seem to measure anything useful and invokes undefined
behavior.
	If you would like a fix, try this:
#define sched_yield() while(false)
