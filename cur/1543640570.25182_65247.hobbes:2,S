Hey Alan
I know that SATA can be attached to any IDE device because the 
controller has all the "legacy crap"
I am not saying that you cant do it just that IDE-TNG should "bah 
humbug" it and let the main IDE deal with it
  I am quite happy to hear you say PCI IDE is looking better but really 
it's going to be gone in the next 2 years as PCI just has not got the 
bandwidth for the new drives
(yeah I know PCIX and vax's are still around in terms of legacy machine 
people hang onto but I am sticking my head in the sand and 
singing...SCSI or SAS )
really I am suggesting that you have IDE-TNG just for a few controllers 
and drives
(real world testing is easier)
and the way to restrict the number is to say Serial ATA only
bad or (partly)good ?
regards
John Jones
