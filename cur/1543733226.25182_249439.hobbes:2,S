But yeah, that is when your memory is completely depleted. A small
modification to your program to make it just keep scanning until we've
freed a set amount of memory obviously shows that the more you've freed,
the easier it becomes to free higher order areas... In this way, having
kswapd batch up the freeing might possibly make it *more* efficient than
only freeing the single higher order area when we've absolutely run out
of areas (and simply failing !wait allocations altogether).
