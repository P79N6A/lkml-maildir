Question, I just upgraded from 2.0.33 and increased the values in fs.h
to:
#define NR_INODE 12288  /* this should be bigger than NR_FILE */
#define NR_FILE 4096    /* this can well be larger on a larger system */
based on prior help to solve problems with apps receiving an Out of File
Descriptors problem.
Well, if I look at the /proc files, these look good:
./file-max
4096
./file-nr
120
./inode-max
12288
./inode-nr
2592    2477
but I'm still getting the OofFD error and now, when I look at file-nr it
is now 120 when before it was 180.  Doing a:
mml1:/proc/sys/kernel# cat 256 > file-nr
sh: file-nr: Permission denied
doesn't work either.
Suggestions please?!?!?
Barry
