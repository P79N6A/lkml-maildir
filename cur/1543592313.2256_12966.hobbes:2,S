Hm.  They're both in active use in 2.4.5pre4.  My cross-referencer shows
CONFIG_ARCH_NEXUSPCI: arch/arm/config.in arch/arm/boot/Makefile arch/arm/kernel/entry-armv.S arch/arm/kernel/arch.c
snark:~/src/linux$ scripts/kxref.py -f "o&~h&~x" -n defconfig | grep FTVPCI
Reading cross-reference database...done.
CONFIG_ARCH_FTVPCI: arch/arm/Makefile arch/arm/config.in arch/arm/boot/compressed/Makefile arch/arm/kernel/Makefile arch/arm/kernel/bios32.c arch/arm/kernel/debug-armv.S arch/arm/def-configs/clps7500 arch/arm/def-configs/shark
On further investigation I find that neither of these symbols is actually 
set in the ARM config file!  This is kind of a mess.  Is it going to be 
fixed in the next merge?
(They're not the only dead symbols.  CONFIG_TBOX and CONFIG_SHARK don't 
have associated questions either.)
