Hmm, isnt the de4x5 quite antiquated, is it even up to 2.2 standard?!

Yes, we thougt so too, we thougt we try some more elaborate testing the
next time it fails (ie. we will re-configure our router not to use the
machine as a trans-proxy) and really try to dig down, our network
HW-guys thougt that maybe the switch was to blame, similar problems has
been known to happen on other switches.

Uh?! the D-Link DF500TX has a true DEC 21140 Tulip with a MII interface,
and yes I use the "drivers/net/tulip.c"-driver (as a module).
