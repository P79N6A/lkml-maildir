No objections. But..
The purpose of this patch was not to fix an oops, but to avoid
partition table parsing in a situation where almost surely
no partition table is present.
If this fixes an oops, then I want to know precisely what oops.
No doubt that same oops could occur in other circumstances where
this patch does not happen to help.
