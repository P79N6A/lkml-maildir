I just saw the v86d emulator code, and you're right. It mmaps /dev/mem 
and assumes the video BIOS is mapped there.
We should try to change that to mmap something like 
"/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:01:00.0/rom" instead so that it can work on 
any system with a video card plugged on a PCI bus.
It should also be possible for the emulator to translate in/out 
instructions to appropriate memory mapped I/O equivalents, no?
Anyway, I think it is up to Michal to decide if we should remove the 
kernel support for other archs, or let it stay a bit more while working 
on solving the v86d side of things. So I'll just step aside now....
