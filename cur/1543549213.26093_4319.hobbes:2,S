This is interesting to hear. I'm doing tests booting
my system with mem=8m and am busy trying to fix the
performance of low-memory systems.
One of the issues which seems to be affecting performance
is the elevator starvation bug, though, so I'm not sure how
much of the problem is a VM issue.
(my test machine is SCSI and has a decent size queue in
hardware so the elevator algorithm problem doesn't hit
... my workstation, with 192MB RAM and an IDE disk, is
seeing the starvation though)
Once the elevator problem has been solved, we should be able
to see if there is still a big VM problem left, but the tests
with low memory on my SCSI-based test box seem to suggest that
it may well be an elevator related problem...
regards,
Rik
