Hi David,
Scripting is already taken care of by the ddsetup utility (a compatible
rewrite of dmsetup) which is just a shell to the ddlink interface.  You
would not want to put the "value add" of dmsetup into kernel.  All that
parsing and massaging belongs in user space.  If there are more scripting
features you need, they should be added to dmsetup/ddsetup, not to the
kernel.
Scripting device mapper has never actually posed a problem.  The real
problem is, there is no nice way to write a C program to do fancy
volume management, so we don't see the advanced features appearing on
Linux at anything like the rate they have appeared on Solaris.
