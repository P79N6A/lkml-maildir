I had the same problem with my Dell Latitude C600 and newer kernels with 
  HZ>100. The solution I found was to add "apm=idle-threshold=100" to 
the kernel commandline, to disable APM idle calls.
You should monitor the temperature of your laptop to make sure it 
doesn't spin wildly and create extra heat if you use the same solution.
Using ACPI instead of APM might also be a solution?
