You seem to ignore that most (all?) of pieces that are used to build a 
computer, hardware and software as well, are bogus, and that a system that 
seems to work is just fortunate enough to not have bad bugs being
triggered.
You can think as long as you want but your computer (as mine) is just an
assembly of pieces of crap and nothing better. :-) 
I base my replies on the technical informations that are send with the
problem descriptions. I cannot waste all my time to ask informations.  I
have a couple of weeks ago replied to a problem of phase change and it
seems that I just waste my time. 
If you want problems to have better chance to be solved, you must provide
information on your system and not only just describe the symptoms.
You testings do not prove anything about the real cause of the problem. 
If bogus A makes problems because of a correct behaviour of B, changing
the behaviour of B may prevent problems of bogus A from being triggered.
Gérard.
