OK, so we can do the same. The kernel can read the serial number(s) when it 
boots, then disable it. 
We can then make it available as a sysctl, and preferably changeable...
# echo "0xdeadbeefdeadbeef 0xdeadbeefdeadbeef" > /proc/sys/kernel/cpuid
The system admin can then remove world-readable permission from the file in 
/proc if he so desires, and it should be possible to log each time a process 
reads it.
We can also implement gethostid(), which can return the serial number of the 
boot processor.
