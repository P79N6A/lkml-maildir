+Advanced APIs for drivers
+-------------------------
+A. Exporting pages to users with remap_pfn_range, io_remap_pfn_range,
+vm_insert_pfn
+
+Drivers wanting to export some pages to userspace do it by using mmap
+interface and a combination of
+1) pgprot_noncached()
+2) io_remap_pfn_range() or remap_pfn_range() or vm_insert_pfn()
+
+With pat support, a new API pgprot_writecombine is being added. So, drivers can
+continue to use the above sequence, with either pgprot_noncached() or
+pgprot_writecombine() in step 1, followed by step 2.
+
+In addition, step 2 internally tracks the region as UC or WC in memtype
+list in order to ensure no conflicting mapping.
+
+Note that this set of APIs only work with IO (non RAM) regions. If a driver
+wants to export a RAM region, it has to do set_memory_uc() or set_memory_wc()
+as step 0 above and also track the usage of those pages and use set_memory_wb()
+before the page is freed to free pool.
