ok so there is no disagreement that these should become _GPL eventually,
only about the "when". There is agreement also about the expectation
that currently no binary module is using these. Personally I would then
suggest removing them right now (as is done in -bk); the longer you wait
the higher the chance of anyone out there starting to use them and
giving/having a problem a year from now, while the current "damage" is
expected to be zero.
