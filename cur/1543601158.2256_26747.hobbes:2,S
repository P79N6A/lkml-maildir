You don't need a driver for them at all.
I had been playing with such a driver (for 2.2) which redirect a
configurable set of keys to a special device /dev/funkey or thelike.
Well, i'm not missing this patch now, there's a great tool called
"hotkeys" for X (available as debian package hotkeys) which has an X11
On-Screen-Display for Volume, predefined mappings for most keyboards and
is really easy to customize. I use that for controlling volume and xmms,
as well as launching some apps. (a "new terminal" hotkey is great ;)
Doesn't help here though - it needs scancodes.
Greetings,
Erich
