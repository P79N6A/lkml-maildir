If the child terminated by calling exit(), regardless of whether it
was done from inside a signal handler, then WIFEXITED() should test
true, but WIFSIGNALED() will not.  If you are seeing otherwise, then
show a *short* program that demonstrates the behavior.  (But it seems
unlikely that there would be a kernel bug on this point, so do check
your program carefully!)
Cheers,
Michael
