Ah, a very useful bit of information, thanks.
It won't help Con though, because he'll be dealing with every possible
configuration.  I think he's going to have to either submit, wait,
bandwidth limiting sleep, repeat or something clever that does that.
Even with bandwidth restriction though, seek still bites mightily, so I
suspect he's stuck with little trickles of IO started when we'd
otherwise be idle.  We'll see I suppose.
