Okay, I see there has been some discussion on this earlier, based on a
proposal by Ram Pai, so it pretty much comes down to redesigning this
right.  I see some issues with his proposal (device numbers exported to
userspace in text form should be separated into major:minor form, for
one thing.)  I know the util-linux-ng people have also had issues with
/proc/mounts that they would like resolved in order to finally nuke
/etc/mtab.
Is Ram still working on this?  I'd like to help make this happen so we
can be done with it.
