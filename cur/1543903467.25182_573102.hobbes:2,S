The backup/restore here has nothing to do with the read/write of the
image. It means instead of preserving memory for a new kernel like that
of crash-dump, the memory for a new kernel is backupped before kexec and
restored after kexec by the kexec kernel.

copy:	dest=src
swap:	tmp=dest; dest=src; src=tmp
If memory is swapped, no information is lost, both that of kexec kernel
and kexeced kernel.
