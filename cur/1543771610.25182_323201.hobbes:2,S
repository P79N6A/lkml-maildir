Attached is the 'git-shortlog' script I whipped up, to mimic the 
shortlog script that was used back in the BitKeeper days.
shortlog reads a changelog in the 'git-whatchanged' format, such as
	git-whatchanged | git-shortlog
		or
	git-shortlog changes.txt
and outputs the changes sorted by author:
	author1:
	  cset 1-line desc
	  cset 1-line desc
	  ...
	author2:
	  cset 1-line desc
	  ...
	...
Since git distinguishes 'author' from 'committer', I ran
	git-whatchanged | git-shortlog > changes.txt
to look at the kernel authors throughout the entire history [of which is 
in git].
It's fun to browse, since this is the first time we've been able to get 
a better picture who is actually writing the patches, versus committing 
them.  See changes.txt.bz2, attached.
