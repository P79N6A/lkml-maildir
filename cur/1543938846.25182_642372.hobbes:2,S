I have to disagree -- remember how strongly Linus pushed to merge
hardware drivers early?  the code in question will not run unless you
have the hardware it drives, and that hardware is useless without the
code.  And *something* is better for users than nothing.
Anyway I don't think the endianness annotations are that hard so it
will probably show up soon.
