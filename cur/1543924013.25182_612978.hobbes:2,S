I hope to be able to use libnuma exclusively once your fix is in place so 
that the interleaving behaves the way we want while attached to a changing 
cpuset.  (And it would be preferable to not have to use a special version 
of it that is hacked to support the fix.)  It's just simpler to use as an 
interface, but I wouldn't consider using the system calls directly an 
error.
