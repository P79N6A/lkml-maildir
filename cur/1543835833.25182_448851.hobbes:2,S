Not quite true.  The ring buffer can be written to from another
processor.  The kernel thread responsible for generating the event
(receiving data from network or disk, expired timer) can run
independently on another CPU.
This is the case to keep in mind here.  I thought Zach and the other
involved in the discussions in Ottawa said this has been shown to be a
problem and that a ring buffer implementation with something other than
simple front and back pointers is preferable.
