Sorry if this is the wrong list to ask this.. direct me to the correct 
list if so...
Question: I would like the kernel not to use any of the video hardware 
on the machine.  Is there any run-time kernel parameter I can pass to 
disable all video?  (I tried console= to direct output to the serial 
port, but ttys were still using the vga hardware.)  My video card is 
built onto the mother board, and there is no way I see to disable it 
from the BIOS. 
I was hoping there was an option such as vga=disable or video=null or 
something like that, but I've looked thru the docs and cannot find anything.
Thanks,
  Davy
