Yep, the current structure works remarkably well.

Actually, I think the boot loader isn't the best place for fancy stuff.
I'd rather put this into the kernel, where I have a much nicer environment,
and where things can be done once for all architectures. initrd was a first
step in this direction.
Something I'd like to try later this year is to allow a running Linux
kernel to directly boot another Linux kernel. This should allow for very
rapid test cycles for kernel development, and it should also allow all the
fancy stuff to be done under Linux, including loading of kernels from any
file system supported by the kernel without the need for prior
registration.
