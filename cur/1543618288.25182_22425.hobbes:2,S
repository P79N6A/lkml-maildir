Well I'm quite willing to give all the system specs we have at work and the 
ones I have at home (all up, this is about 12 Athlon's that are running 
Linux, all running fine so far with no issues) towards this process.
I've not seen your system specs, so I'm wondering what sort of m/board you 
have? The mention of the SiS AGP support makes me wonder if you are running 
an SiS chipset board. In the past, Linux kernel developers and the XFree86 
team have had a huge amount of trouble (or in some cases, flat refusal) in 
getting certain (usually up to date) specs out of SiS, and I'm wondering if 
maybe this could be related somehow, as none of the systems I've got have 
an SiS chipset in them (they are all AMD or VIA chipsets).
Now I'm not saying this is an SiS issue, but maybe it's more prevalent with 
SiS chipsets? Until we get some hard data, who knows!
