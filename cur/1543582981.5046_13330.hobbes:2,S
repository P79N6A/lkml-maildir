I can lock both of them up in 10 seconds with a simple test.
Why would anyone want to "discuss" paying intel when the license allows you 
to distribute it for nothing? Its clearly designed as an alternative to GPL 
for commercial vendors.
There have been ongoing complaints and discussions over eepro100 problems 
on many of the lists that I know you monitor, so why are you in denial 
about it?

LINUX has no formal documentation, so are you guilty of "closedness" also? 
(ie "where is the 2.4 device driver spec?"), You have source to the e100 
driver (which handles initialization properly,  unlike the eepro driver), 
so what more documentation do you need? it seems that intel is being as 
"open" as the LInux camp, actually more so. At least with the eepro you can 
get the docs under non-disclosure. Under LInux you have no chance unless 
someone feels like helping you.
