I don't think this function should exist at all.  We already have kobjects
which represent the CPUs so it should be possible to find that kobject and
use kobject_hotplug() on it.  That gives you your $DEVPATH.
Does CPU hotplug behave correctly wrt /sys/devices/system/cpu?  Given that
register_cpu() is still marked __init, I assume not.
