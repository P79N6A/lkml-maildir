Known issue. Could you try applying the commit at
http://linux-nfs.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=nfs-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=6ce7dc940701cf3fde3c6e826a696b333092cbb1;hp=aa3d1faebe6e214cd96be0e587571477ff6fd9fc
and see if that suffices to fix the issue?

The problem is that the above only appears to break on 64-bit compiles.
gcc gave no errors at all on a 386, and so the problem was detected only
after the merge.
