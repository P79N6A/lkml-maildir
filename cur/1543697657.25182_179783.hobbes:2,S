SELinux controls hard link creation by checking, among other things,
the security context of the process attempting the link, and the security
context of the target (oldpath).  Other MAC systems do similar, and some
patches such as grsec and owl simply disable linking to files the user
can't read/write to for example.

SuS states:
	The implementation may require that the calling process has
	permission to access the existing file.
Note the use of *may*.
