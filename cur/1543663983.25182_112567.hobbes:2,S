My first attempt at mounting nfs with 2.5.63 resulted in a segfault.
Two more attempts at the same directory and another resulted in
mount processes in D-state.
2.5.59 has no problems.
The relevant line from etc/fstab:
www.aitel.hist.no:/www/innhold    /www     nfs 
rsize=4096,wsize=8192,user,noauto,hard,intr  0      0
The kernel has UP, preempt, everything compiled-in
(no module support at all), devfs compiled but not mounted.
I can do tcpdumps if that helps.
