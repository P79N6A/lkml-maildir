Here are three good reasons.
 - You want the key lifetime to be the same as your process lifetime
 - You want the key to be readable ONLY by that one process.
 - The kernel wants to supports multiple security realms and mechanisms.
Not everybody is happy with just kerberosV credentials, and we already
have beta code for the SPKM mechanism in RPCSEC_GSS.
As for the AFS PAG idea: it's already been shot down. See the
linux-fsdevel thread I referred to earlier.
