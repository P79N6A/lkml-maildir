Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

This series contains the following:
o	Catch-up updates to the rcutorture documentation.
o	Ops vector for rcutorture to allow it to test multiple RCU
	implementations (e.g., both call_rcu() and call_rcu_bh()
	currently in mainline).
o	Add operations to allow the _bh variant of RCU to be tested.
						Thanx, Paul
