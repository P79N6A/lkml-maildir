I still can't completely understand your direction of thoughts.
Could you elaborate on IP address assignment in your diagram, please?  For
example, guest0 wants 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.0.1 addresses on its lo
interface, and 10.1.1.1 on its eth0 interface.
Does this diagram assume any local IP addresses on v* interfaces in the
"host"?
And the second question.
Are vlo0, veth0, etc. devices supposed to have hard_xmit routines?
Best regards
Andrey
