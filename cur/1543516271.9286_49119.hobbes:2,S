It's been a while since I've looked at this, but IIRC, the salt in this
case should be "$1$hI.ost8u$", not "$1"... the "$1$" identifies to the
crypt function to use the MD5 algorithm, rather than the DES variant, the
"hI.ost8u" portion is the actual salt, followed by another "$" terminator.
Using a salt string that does not start with "$1$" results in the legacy
DES variant crypt functionality.
I may not have gotten that all right, but it should give you someplace
to start - peruse the libc source for more details...
