How do we prevent that somebody tries to register a POSIX timer event 
source with kevent_ctl(KEVENT_CTL_ADD)?  This should only be possible 
from sys_timer_create and nowhere else.
Can you add a parameter to kevent_enqueue indicating this is a call from 
inside the kernel and then ignore certain enqueue callbacks?

We need to pass the data in the sigev_value meember of the struct 
sigevent structure passed to timer_create to the caller.  I don't see it 
being done here nor when the timer is created.  Do I miss something? 
The sigev_value value should be stored in the user/ptr member of struct 
ukevent.

Don't use a bit.  It makes no sense to combine SIGEV_SIGNAL with 
SIGEV_KEVENT etc.  Only SIGEV_THREAD_ID is a special case.
Just define SIGEV_KEVENT to 3 and replace the tests like the one cited 
above with
   if (timr->it_sigev_notify == SIGEV_KEVENT)
