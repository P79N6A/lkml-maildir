You might make this a module parameter so we can test with various
sizes.

DMA_NAK is better default for DMA_RESOURCE_AVAILABLE once you've got the
channel you want, as that will stop DMAEngine from handing you more, and
doesn't bother the DMA_RESOURCE_REMOVED process.

Do you ever want to test a specific channel?  Is there a way to identify
specific channels, perhaps by checking the PCI bus/chan/func?  This
could be useful in debugging specific hardware issues - a frilly extra
feature and very HW specific, but potentially useful.  I suppose this
might also depend upon your hardware - is there more than one channel in
your gizmo?

Should you use your test->lock here?

Since this is a test program, perhaps a printk() here might be useful...

Hmmm - so the only way to trigger the loop is to remove then add a
channel, basically rmmod and insmod your dma driver?  It would be nice
to have a method to trigger more than one test, maybe even a stream of
copy requests.  Or am I asking for too many features?  :-)

I suppose you are doing this extra get and put to be absolutely sure the
channel doesn't disappear out from under you, even though your
dmatest_event() already ACK'd the removal, right?
