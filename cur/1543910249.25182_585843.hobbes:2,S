Yup, that's what I'd said just a few sentences above, as you can see. I
was actually asking for "elaboration" on "how a compiler determines that
function foo() (say foo == schedule), even when it cannot see that it has
a barrier(), as you'd mentioned, is a 'sleeping' function" actually, and
whether compilers have a "notion of sleep to automatically assume a
compiler barrier whenever such a sleeping function foo() is called". But
I think you've already qualified the discussion to this kernel, so okay,
I shouldn't nit-pick anymore.
