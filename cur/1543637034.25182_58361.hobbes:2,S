Before the freeze it should be fine, after all if working IDE is optional
in a development kernel IPV6 is certainly not a must-have (unless it
seriously break IPV4, obviously).

Not that I have used, this was more of a preemptive effort to get it in
2.6 rather than 2.8, since most vendors will be shipping in less than a
year if you believe their unofficial comments. And if the benefits are
there it would be a good thing to have first, perhaps.

I haven't had it work since about 2.6 on a BP6 with an adaptor, but it did
work in 2.4.early. Of course it could be related to the new IDE stuff
making compact flash fail, but even building a uni kernel doesn't help. I
bought a cheap used laptop just to use as a card reader, but I'd rather
not stay that way ;-) Guess for now that's the "right hardware."
Thanks for all the additional feedback.
