the n column is the number of times the lock has been held.  the lock is
probably held numerous times in a given second, so you see large n
values.
note that all those rows you showed could be in one row, but the
top-latencies tool keeps them separate since they have a different mask.
anyhow, the max recorded latency is 9.5ms which is not too bad.  I'm not
looking at the code, but I would imagine its some TCP work done in a
BH.  I wouldn't worry too much.
