I think the set_fs_root() comment is just wrong.
We properly lock the accesses to root/rootmnt with "fs->lock", and in fact 
no other users will have the BKL when accessing them anyway, so I don't 
see what the BKL would help in this case.
However, from a quick grep of users, it does look like some other users 
aren't real careful with "fs->lock" (ie chroot_fs_refs() looks like it 
could have problems - probably purely theoretical).
Al, do your eagle-eyes see something I missed?
