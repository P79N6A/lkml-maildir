Well, many a home user simply doesn't have a a spare block device of 
the same size.  The hassle of reinstalling instead of just waiting
out a fsck is something still.  
The ext filesystems are nice in that they have spare superblocks,
if the main one dies from a bad sector, the spares still work
so you don't loose the entire fs to only a few damaged sectors.

I only lost a few files, then went shopping for a new disk. :-)
