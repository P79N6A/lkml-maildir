Well, as I warned in the message that had the patch, the test _is_ racy. 
The reads of the page counts have no serialization, so if another process 
is changing them, I don't guarantee that the test is correct.
IOW, it was meant as a special case debug test for one particular problem 
where I hoped it would give more information, rather than a real patch.
