It turns out that there is an uncommented hack in x86_64's version of
__prepare_ICR().
	case NMI_VECTOR:
                icr |= APIC_DM_NMI;
		break;
That hack is not in i386, which means that IPI 2 does different things
in i386 vs. x86_64 mode on the same hardware.  I am still tracking down
all the differences before doing a clean up patch that makes i386 and
x86_64 behave the same.
