In directcolor mode, the pixel color is:
    (clut.red[r], clut.green[g], clut.blue[b])
with r, g, and b being the values in the pixel (i.e. they are in the range
0..31 for RGB555, and g in the range 0..63 for RGB565).
In truecolor mode, the pixel color is:
    (r, g, b)

It's very strange that it did work before, since there's no way to set up the
32-entry CLUT (of which BTW the first 16 colors are the standard console
colors) for any random 224-color image in RGB555 mode.
In RGB888 mode (24-bit color) it's possible though, since the CLUT has 256
entries.
Can you show us a screenshot (e.g. using fbgrab) of the old behavior?
