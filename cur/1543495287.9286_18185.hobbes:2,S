I recently had what appeared to be identical problems to yours, and it
turned out to be a flaky CD drive - as soon as I changed the CD drive,
the problems vanished and RH 6.0 installed as smooth as silk...
If you don't have a spare CD drive to check with, try doing an NFS or
FTP install across your network interface instead...

Hardware problems, probably, but not necessarily with memory. From a
diagnostics point of view, the best sequence to follow is:
 1. User error.
 2. Mechanical parts failure.
 3. Electromechanical parts failure.
 4. Electrical parts failure.
 5. Electronic parts failure.
The CD drive falls under either (2) or (3) depending on whether it's
the focussing or decoding sections, but the RAM falls under (5), so is
much further down the list...

No idea, but I've cc'd this to him in case...
Best wishes from Riley.
