Al has been working on the problem.  To permanently fix it so it doesn't
break each time a change to do_open() happens.  Yes, this ramdisk driver
is that brittle.

My temporary hack around the problem was to use rd_length[unit] since
that's already in bytes.  But anything that adds code here just makes
the driver slightly more brittle.
