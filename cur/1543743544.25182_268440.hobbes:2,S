There does appear to be hope here.  If the per-task mutex ownership
list is maintained in strict order of acquisition sequence and
reader-mutex acquisition sequence is policed this would seem to remove
the possibly of chain traversal deadlock.
As an implementation note, single-owner hard spinlocks seem
excessive for the chain walk.  An approach allowing maximum
concurrency during traversal would be a reader-reference acquired
per node during the walk which would need to upgrade to an exclusive
writer-reference to effect promotion (waiter list priority reorder),
and then downgrade to a reader-reference to continue the traversal.
