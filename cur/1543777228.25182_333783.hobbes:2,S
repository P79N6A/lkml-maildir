Well iptables (which allows you to simply build firewall rulesets)
is the user-space part of the packet filter called netfilter in linux.
What it does (blocks or allows) is always up to the user, as with all firewalls,
except the majority of dummy windows firewalls and dummy linux scripts)
Others are of course in freebsd, netbsd, openbsd, opensolaris :-)
It really usually is a mixture of both kernel- and user-space code.
