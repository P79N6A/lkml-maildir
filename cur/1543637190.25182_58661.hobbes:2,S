Subject: non-critical ext3-fs errors?

I notice these errors every now and then on my 100GB WD drive
(partitioned into bits) and particularly on this partition that I
compile everything on.   
EXT3-fs error (device ide0(3,7)): ext3_readdir: bad entry in directory
#17821: directory entry across blocks - offset=24, inode=17822,
rec_len=4076, name_len=3 
Now these errors dont cause the system to panic like other ext3 errors
do, so i'm wondering what the significance of these errors are.   I'm
running 2.4.19-rc3   and the drive is on VIA vt82c686b (rev 40) IDE
UDMA100 controller with dma enabled.
