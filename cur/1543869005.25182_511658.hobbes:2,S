Can you have a look at the differences between the defconfigs for 2.6.20
and 2.6.21-rc1?
If the backlight changes are at fault, I'm guessing James' Kconfig
changes to the video Kconfig would be the culprit since
FB_RADEON_BACKLIGHT only used to be selectable if PMAC_BACKLIGHT was
enabled. On a thinkpad, the backlight is probably under ACPI control.
If FB_RADEON_BACKLIGHT wasn't set for 2.6.20, can you try 2.6.21-rc1
with that option disabled?
An ls /sys/class/backlight under 2.6.20 will tell us which driver it was
using...
Thanks,
Richard
