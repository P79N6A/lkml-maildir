Inode 12 is a perfectly valid inode number for any filesystem, so your
ext2 superblock must have been corrupt (or zeroed out) at this point.
The value for sb->u.ext2_sb.s_es->s_inodes_count must have been < 12
(likely zero), which would explain all of these errors.  Strange.
I have posted (twice) a patch which would prevent the BUG from happening.
Granted, it won't help your RAID/SCSI corruption problem (*).  Please see
  [PATCH] sanity checks for ext2 root inode
in l-k archives.  I don't think this is in either Linus' or Alan's tree.
Cheers, Andreas
(*) in normal cases this prevents a small filesystem corruption from
    halting the system, but in your case, the BUG may have prevented
    larger corruption by halting the system before more damage was done?
