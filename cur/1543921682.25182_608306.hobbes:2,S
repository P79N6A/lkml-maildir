You're right, there's no need to have the tuner-core code remove the tea5761
function calls as the stubs will take care of it.
We could delete the #if/#endif around the 0x10 address to scan, or keep it.
What's better, to not scan the address if it's not needed, or to scan it and
then produce an error message if something is found there?
But if it stays, it should look like this:
> > #if defined(CONFIG_TUNER_TEA5761) || (defined(CONFIG_TUNER_TEA5761_MODULE) && defined(MODULE))
i.e., only scan 0x10 if there is callable tea5761 code to handle it.
