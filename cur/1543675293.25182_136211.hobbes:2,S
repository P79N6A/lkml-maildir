That's the case now, isn't it? unless the person with the non-working
hardware is willing and able to become the maintainer a lot of drivers
don't seem to get fixed. Unfortunately that the people with the old
hardware usually aren't developers.

Totally agree.

I don't think anyone suggested that, but there are a fair number of
drivers which could be fixed in minutes by someone who understands the new
interface. Replacing cli is easy, knowing what you replace it with is
something else again. There are new locks, per-cpu stuff added, lockless
methods... to do this right you have to do it often, and few users can do
more than give an error report which allows the problem to be reproduced.
