My reason for pointing out the other data strucutres is to note that there
might be search tree representations that are more appropriate for
implementation inside the kernel, and to perhaps encourage you to have
a look at implementing them as well.  Red-black trees in particular have
the property that they're reasonably well-balanced, and that the balancing
algorithm makes use of local information.  That means that the kernel might
be able to limit the level of locking required to update the tree.
I liked your B-tree implementation, and have saved a copy.  Too bad there
isn't the C/C++ equivalent of CPAN (comp.unix.sources is so passe`).  Your
B-tree implementation would make a nice addition to an archive of
handy C algorithm implementations.
