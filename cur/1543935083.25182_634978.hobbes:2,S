If someone works in a company where the default MUA setting is to also 
attach the text as HTML and to add a vCard to all emails people might
try once to submit their bug report, not notice that it didn't arrive
on the list, and then simply give up.

Currently the page for attaching a file has a "Submit" button.

People reporting bugs together with a patch to fix it are not the usual 
case but an exception.

This depends on how people answer in Bugzilla.
But an advantage of Bugzilla is that each email contains a link to the 
Bugzilla bug containing all discussions in the bug.

If you report a regression in the kernel and are not willing to bisect 
the probability of the bug being resolved becomes _much_ smaller.
Partially due to this requiring much more developer time, but also 
partially due to the fact that many regressions are undebuggable without 
a bisection.

People tend to report bugs if and only they have no other choice (like 
some workaround).
So when they report a bug they really need a fix for their problem.
And have you ever worked in a company that pays a seven digit amount of 
Euros each year to Oracle for licences and support for their database?
I have. It's not that spending some man days on debugging or working 
around one of the many regressions in the POS they ship to their paying 
costumers was unusual.
But you might need the new release e.g. because the older release no 
longer has security support or has another bug that is fixed in the 
latest release, so your boss has no choice than assigning you for
as long as required at helping Oracle support to figure out what they 
have broken this time.

It's good for finding what caused a regression.
If a user doesn't want to spend some time helping to find a problem he 
experiences there's nothing we can do.
Where we can and should improve is to no longer scare people who do 
report bugs and who are willing to spend some time on helping to debug 
bugs away by keeping their bug reports unanswered.

And how would he react when he gets a request to bisect the bug?

That's neither our fault nor our problem.
Our problem are the people who whine because bugs they actually 
reported stay unfixed.

If users don't report a bug they run into that's their problem.

Sure, that's no different from email addresses in lkml archives...

When the expensive part of bug reporting is pasting the bug report 
somewhere the submitter most likely hasn't spent enough time on writing 
a proper bugreport.
Bug reports are important contributions to development, but our 
problems are not related to getting more bug reports but to coping with 
the incoming bug reports.
