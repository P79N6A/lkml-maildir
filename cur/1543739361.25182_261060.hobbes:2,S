Subject: Patch to add RAID autostart to IBM partitions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi, guys:
This is an implementation of essentially the same mechanism which exists
in msdos.c and sun.c. It is needed when initrd tries to mount a root
on a RAID. One might ask, why the heck initrd cannot do it without a
kernel help. The answer is in the contrived API of the MD driver: there
is no way to ask "assemble md0"; applications must list components.
Anyway, if msdos.c does it, surely ibm.c ought to do it as well.
Please apply.

P.S. Martin: this is for bug LTC10616.
