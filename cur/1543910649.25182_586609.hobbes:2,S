Subject: [patch 02/20] hwmon: (smsc47m1) restore missing name attribute
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Jean Delvare <khali@linux-fr.org>
The smsc47m1 driver no longer creates the name attribute used by
libsensors to identify chip types. It was lost during the conversion
to a platform driver. I was fooled by the fact that we do have a
group with all attributes, but only to delete them all at once. The
group is not used to create the attributes, so we have to explicitly
create the name attribute.
