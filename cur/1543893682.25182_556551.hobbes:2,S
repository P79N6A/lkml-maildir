There's quite a lot of hand waving in that section.  What I'd like to do
is work closely with the LVM/DM/MD maintainers and come up with
something that leverages what linux already does.  I don't want to
rewrite LVM into the FS, but I do want to make better use of info about
the underlying storage.

Yes, I wanted snapshots to be writable and resnapshottable.  It also
lowers the complexity to keep each snapshot as a subvolume/tree.
subvolumes are only slightly more expensive than a directory.  So, even
though a subvolume is a large grained unit for a snapshot, you can get
around this by just making more subvolumes.

That's somewhat true, the disk format does have enough information to
show you that history, but cleanly expressing it to the user is a
daunting task.

One option is to put the real btrfs root into some directory in
(/sys/fs/btrfs/$device?) and then use tools in userland to mount -o bind
outside of that.  I wanted to wait to get fancy until I had a better
idea of how people would use the feature.

Thanks for the comments.
