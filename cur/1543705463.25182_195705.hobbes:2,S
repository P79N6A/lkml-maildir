I`m sorry, but this is misguiding. 2.6 does not have a few performance
problems under heavy pageout.
It`s more like _systematical_ _performance_ _degradation_ increasing with
the pageout rate. The more the box pages out the more 2.6 lags behind 2.4.
What i`m trying to say is that even light paging is affected. And light
paging is warranted when you run, say, KDE on 128M ram.
Go measure the X desktop startup time on a 48M/64M boxen--even light paging
causes 2.6 to be just sloower. Also the vm thrashing point is much much earlier.
Ask Roger Luethi for details.
