My main point is not related to __cpu*
E.g. look at the following warnings:
WARNING: drivers/pci/built-in.o(.text+0xa385): Section mismatch in 
reference from the function cpci_configure_slot() to the function 
.devinit.text:pci_do_scan_bus()
WARNING: drivers/pci/built-in.o(.text+0x13052): Section mismatch in 
reference from the function cpqhp_configure_device() to the function 
.devinit.text:pci_do_scan_bus()
WARNING: drivers/pci/built-in.o(.text+0x1561c): Section mismatch in 
reference from the function ibm_configure_device() to the function 
.devinit.text:pci_do_scan_bus()
WARNING: drivers/pci/built-in.o(.text+0x26176): Section mismatch in 
reference from the function shpchp_configure_device() to the function 
.devinit.text:pci_do_scan_bus()
The code seems to be 100% correct, but how can I silence the warnings 
without needlessly bloating the kernel in the CONFIG_HOTPLUG=n case?
