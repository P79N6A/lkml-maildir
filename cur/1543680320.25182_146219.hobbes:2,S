On an Athlon 600 running 2.4.20, with ulimit -u 2047, the box recovers
no problem from the fork bomb.
On my Celeron 800 running 2.4.21, ulimit -u 1500, the box recovers after
4-5 minutes.
ulimit -u 2047 (Debian's default ulimit), the box fights for 5-10
minutes, and no longer responds after 10.  I can see fork perrors in
the terminal like usual, but the machine no longer responds. (I waited
more than half an hour.)
