hello,
     I am checking some conditions in packet after IP
header is removed and based on that want network stack
to discard skbuff so i add it in ip_input.c . 
       But it gives oops message that 
Warning: kfree_skb passed an skb still on a list and
then prints oops 
       Please help how to do that and correct me to
use a way by which i will not face any kernel panic
message? 
Thanks in advance.
regards,
linux_lover.
