Just because a device can eat XXX number of tags does definitely _not_
make it a good idea. At least not if you care the slightest bit about
latency.

At least for this tagging discussion, I'm of the exact opposite
oppinion. What's the worst that can happen with a tag setting that is
too low? Theoretical loss of disk bandwidth. I say theoretical, because
it's not even given that tags are that much faster then the Linux io
scheduler. More tags might even give you _worse_ throughput, because you
end up leaving the io scheduler with much less to work on (if you have a
253 depth to you device, you have 3 requests left for the queue...).
So I think the 'more tags the better!' belief is very much bogus, at
least for the common case.
