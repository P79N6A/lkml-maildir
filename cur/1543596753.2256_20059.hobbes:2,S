Hmmm, indeed.  I guess this also means page aging in its
current form cannot even work well with exponential down
aging since the down aging on the pageout list always
cancels out the up aging in swap_out() ...
I guess it's time we found some volunteers to experiment
with linear down aging (page->age--;) since that one will
be able to withstand pages being referenced only in the
page tables.
(now, off to a project 4000 km from home for the next 2
weeks ... bbl)

Rik
