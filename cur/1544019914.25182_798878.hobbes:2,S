Thanks for testing. I see. What is the 'alignment problems'? Well,
anyway, can I get the disk image of USB, or are there any way to
reproduce it in my machine?
Or can you dump with hacked userland command (this can be buggy)?
	
http://userweb.kernel.org/~hirofumi/exfat/exfat-userland.tar.gz
$ tar xzf exfat-userland.tar.gz
$ cd exfat-userland
$ make
$ ./exfat /path/to/exfat_device > exfat.dump
And please send exfat.dump.
Well, if you can debug it with this userland command, it would be
helpful. :)
Thanks.
