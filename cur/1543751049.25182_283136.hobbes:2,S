You can do that already, just make everyone root
The problem with uid/gid based hacks is that they get really ugly to
administer really fast. Especially once you have users who need realtime
and hugetlb, and users who need one only.
It would be far cleaner to split CAP_SYS_NICE capability down - which
should cover the real time OS functions nicely. Right now it gives a few
too many rights but that could be fixed easily.
