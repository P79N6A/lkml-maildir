Especially, please, let's avoid once for all statically defined table,
on PPC (specifically on pmac) the table is really dynamic, and
the "legacy ports" (if any) may not be ttyS0..1, but could well be
2..3, or higher, all this having to be decided at runtime for both
built-in driver and modular (so eraly_serial_setup isn't good).
I quite like the sub-module mecanism. I'd rather have it done the
opposite though. I don't care that much about sharing those files
with the bootloader, and i'd rather see the core serial code beeing
a submodule of the arch specific module.
Typically, that would give us:
 - 8250_legacy.c would load 8250 core, probe legacy ports and
instanciate them for typical x86 setup
 - 8250_ppc.c would instanciate known ports on PReP or CHRP machines
and do nothing on pmac
 - 8250_pci.c would be a pci_driver and instanciate ports for a given
PCI card
 - 8250_cs.c would be a pcmcia driver and instanciate ports for a 
given PCMCIA modem card
etc... And of course, we can have an arbitrary set of the above loaded
instanciating ports are they are found.
