	No API is guaranteed to be stable forever. And I think the
overall track record of stability for the Wireless Extensions is
pretty good.
	On top of that, the tools themselves *WARNS YOU* when there is
an API incompatibility, giving the user the change to correct the
issue. There is not many API having such feature...
	In my mind, the whole point of the GIT and RC process is to
test changes before setting them in stone, so that we have the time to
correct our mistakes. I definitely think the process is working
properly.
	If you think I jumped the gun, consider that both FC and
Mandriva which have the right userspace bits are in RC phase
(FC6-test3 and 2007-rc2), and therefore will ship about the same time
2.6.19 hits final. And Debian with the right userspace bits is
supposed to be released in december (no comment).
