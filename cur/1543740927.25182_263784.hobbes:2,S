Subject: Unknown symbol kill_proc_info in 2.6.10-rc1

After building 2.6.10-rc1, i was unable to load my "lufs" module due to 
an unknown symbol error (kill_proc_info).  When I examined the 
2.6.10-rc1 patch, I noticed that "EXPORT_SYMBOL(kill_proc_info);" was 
removed from signal.c.  With the following patch, I was able to resolve 
my problem, but I am not sure if this is the correct method.  Is there a 
reason why the kill_proc_info symbol is no longer exported?
