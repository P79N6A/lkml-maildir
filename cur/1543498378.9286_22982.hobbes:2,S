You've seem to have missed the earlier part of the conversation. What
devfs allows, and what can't be done in user space, is:
    opendir ("/dev/ide/cd");
    loop;
and be assured that:
- /dev/ide/cd is populated with device nodes for any IDE CD-ROMs you
  have
- /dev/ide/cd contains *only* IDE CD-ROM device nodes.
Thus each and every entry (except "." and "..") is an IDE CD-ROM. No
more, no less.
