<DIV>Hello,<BR><BR>I reformatted my USB Zip 100 drive recently (using the win98 
formatting <BR>tools). Previous to this, I mounted it as /dev/sda4 
<BR>(/dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/something) since I have devfs 
installed).&nbsp; <BR>This no longer works.&nbsp; In that directory there is 
only generic, which was <BR>there before but which had been accompanied by 2 
other entries (which I can't <BR>remember).&nbsp; I was running 
2.4.0-test5.&nbsp; I read on linux-kernel recently that <BR>after you reformat 
the disk it isn't mounted to same way (hence the cc).&nbsp; <BR>Could someone 
please email me (I'm not subscribed to either list) with <BR>instructions.&nbsp; 
I have been all over the linux-usb web site without any luck <BR>finding an 
answer.<BR><BR>Thank you,<BR><BR>Kevin Winchester<BR></DIV></BODY></HTML>
