I don't think that's a fair comment - however I never read any of those
udev/devfs flamewars.  As the lead developer of an embedded architecture,
I find that many people here do not take that attitude.
More the problem is that many embedded folk aren't here to air their
*technical* arguments because they can't keep up with the lkml traffic
level.
Consequently, lkml folk don't get the feedback from embedded folk, and
hence probably why udev doesn't/didn't work with ash.
