A well-written init will be saved by being the oldest process around.
A memory-leaking init _will_ be killed even whith your magic test,
when the kernel eventually gets stuck OOM and init is the only
process left (all the other have been OOM-killed before.)  
A deadlocked kernel don't schedule any processes, so they are all dead.
If you want init to live - prove that it don't eat too much memory.
