heh, good luck writing a testcase.
It's super-improbable because we fault the source page in by hand in
generic_file_aio_write_nolock() via fault_in_pages_readable().  Of course,
that prefaulting isn't 100% reliable either, because the VM can come in and
steal the page (or at least unmap its pte) before we get to doing the copy.
I think we can fix both problems by changing filemap_copy_from_user() and
filemap_copy_from_user_iovec() to not fall back to kmap() - just fail the
copy in some way if the atomic copy failed.  Then, in
generic_file_aio_write_nolock(), do a zero-length ->commit_write(),
put_page(), then go back and retry the whole thing, starting with
fault_in_pages_readable().
