Damn, you're right. Now I got the docs from Intel (at the time were the 
patch to support 845g was submitted, they were just not available yet), 
and truly the specs are closer to the 845, so let's switch to 
'intel_845_setup' to initialize the 845g. Not that it should change 
things too much, but it will avoid further confusions....
Best regards.
