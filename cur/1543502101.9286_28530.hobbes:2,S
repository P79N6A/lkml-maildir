	Well, what is the copyright status of your sources?
Can I get the sources, develop the frame relay driver/layer using
these as the documentation (and probably using some constants from
the header files to avoid duplication of work) and then distribute
my work under GPL? If so, can you please mail me the sources
to <kas@fi.muni.cz> or make it available on FTP for me?
