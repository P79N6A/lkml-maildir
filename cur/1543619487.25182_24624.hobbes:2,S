 -ENOTAWAKEYET. Yes, I meant -dj7 there. oops.

 I keep a directory named after each revision, patches get dumped there
 as I merge them, and also I dump bits of ~/Mail/merged there.
 These patches however are not always identical to what gets merged,
 as they sometimes need to be bent into shape to live with something
 else that got merged, I hand-edit the diffs to make them apply,
 sometimes removing complete hunks, and grafting that hunks intention
 into place in the source instead.
 So they're of little use to anyone in their current state, given that
 there are 'holes' where I chopped bits out.  Sometimes I rediff the
 patch afterwards, but not always.
