After poking around a bit, it seems like the real problem might be
with the ALI15X3 driver.  I disabled that driver, and now I can boot
using 2.4.19-pre10-ac2.  Of course, that leaves me with no DMA...
So -- is this a general problem with this driver, or does it only
show up when using disks bigger than 128GiB?
