Sigh ..I dont see a simple solution, unless we have something like
lock_cpu_hotplug() ..
Andrew,
	This workqueue problem has exposed a classic example of how 
tough/miserable it can be to write hotplug safe code w/o something like
lock_cpu_hotplug() ..Are you still inclined towards banning it? :)
FYI, the lock_cpu_hotplug() rewrite proposed by Gautham at
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/26/65
 may still need refinement to avoid
all the kind of deadlocks we have unearthed with workqueue example. I
can review that design with Gautham if there is some interest to
revive lock_cpu_hotplug() ..

Yep ..
