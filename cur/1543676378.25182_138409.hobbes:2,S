   But in the case of ATM device and VCC handling, you
   already have all the synchronous code paths (because things are
   initiated by user space), they're not very timing-critical, and
   reuse before destruction has completed is unlikely.
VCC's are just like routes, they are setup by a control
layer in userspace, and RTNL should therefore protect changes
to such things.
But regardless I should be able to yank an ATM device out of the
kernel (unregistering it) even if there are a thousand VCC's attached
to it.  The user control process gets a netlink message saying to kill
them off, but that's entirely seperate from the unregistering act
itself.
