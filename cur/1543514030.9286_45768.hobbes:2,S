  Yes, now you can have module version 0.3 for kernels 2.0.36
  and 2.2.10 compiled.
  We will have sources (compiled core + some sources platform indep.
  to be compiled in various versions of kernel) in the first q. 2000.

  It will not be open sourced completely but if it will work
  I think I will not mind it... I think some source to be compiled
  on various kernels will be enough for me. I did not say I like
  this non-free model but what can I do with it ?

  You need not to downgrade to those kernels, simply use "-f" switch ;-)
    Good luck
