Yeah, and there are not going to do that because there are lots of useful 
stuff codecs like to do that represents no security issue but is nevertheless 
impossible with SECCOMP (according to the documentation).
Expanding the heap, mapping memory. Getting timestamps. Waiting on futexes, 
catching signals, polling file descriptors. Seeking, doing vectorized I/O. 
Cloning.
Codecs don't like to read/write raw video through a pipe...
