it's not the recovery part, it's regular flash. Flash is written by
pumping the processor into SMM mode and running code out of the SMM memory
in BigReal mode. As part of the process it sets the Secret Bit. Of course,
the bad guys already know which bit that is :-) (but we don't :-()
They don't seem to worry as much about being sued by Intel, wonder why :-)
The recovery part is protected by a physical jumper, thank goodness. 
As for bootimg I think it does enough that I can get LOBOS functionality
out of it, so it's no big deal. But we still have to think about PTEs on
other boxes.
