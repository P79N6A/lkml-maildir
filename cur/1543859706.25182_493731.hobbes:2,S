Right, I missed that.

I does, my point there is just that in that case gdb would stick the
0xffff value in the right place, which it doesn't without the patch.

I'm not sure what you mean by the '%gs->%fs patch'. Do you refer to 
convert-i386-pda-code-to-use-%fs-fixes.patch
which is in -mm1?
Or is there another one I might have missed? For the record, I'm running
-mm1 + the efl_offset patch.
