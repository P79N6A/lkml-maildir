i'm not sure i understand your point. You said that for small systems 
with a low NUMA factor it doesnt really matter where the pagecache is 
placed. I mostly agree with that. And since placement makes no 
difference there, we can freely shape things for the systems where it 
does make a difference. It will probably make a small win on smaller 
systems too, as a bonus. Ok?

i also mentioned software-based clusters in the previous mail, so it's 
not only about big systems. Caching attributes are very much relevant 
there. Tightly integrated clusters can be considered NUMA systems with a 
NUMA factor of 1000 or so (or worse).

well, would the "nearby policy" make a difference on the small systems?  
Small systems (to me) are just a flat and symmetric hierarchy of nodes - 
the next step from SMP. So there's really just two distances: local to 
the node, and one level of 'alien'. Or do you include systems in this 
category that have bigger assymetries?
