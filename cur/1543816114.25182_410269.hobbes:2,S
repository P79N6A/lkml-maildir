If you open Audit option, audit subsystem will audit all the syscalls, 
so it adds big overhead for the whole system,
but Filesystem Event Connector just concerns those operations related to 
the filesystem, so it has little overhead,
moreover, audit subsystem is a complicated function block, it not only 
sends audit results to netlink interface, but also
 send them to klog or syslog, so it will add big overhead.
I think you can look File Event Connector as subset of audit subsystem, 
but File Event Connector is a very lightweight
 subsystem.
