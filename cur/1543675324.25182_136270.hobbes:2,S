For me it is problem because whole machine "freezes" (no reaction on 
anything) for 2-3 minutes.... - and after 2-3 minutes it has load about 
50-100 - I think that it has higher load (>100) when it "freezes" then 
after next 2-3 minutes situation repeates....

In top I can see that many processes are in state R (e.g. over 50)....
Strange it is that on slover machine (2*1GHz) and slover disks (7200 / 
160Mb/s) this was no "strange" effect like this....
