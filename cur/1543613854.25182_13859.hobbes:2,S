Hi,
In our institute we have a cluster system with 6 sytems that have the 
following
configuration :
CPU: PIII 1GHZ/133 MHZ (DUAL)
MOTHER: Intel Server Board STL2 (intergrated Intel pro/100+ & Adaptec 
Ultra 160 SCSI) Chipset ServerWorks OSB4
NET CARD: 3COM Broadcom BCM5700 (Gigabit)
RAID Cont. : AMI MegaRAID (only in PBS server)
HDD: IBM       Model: DDYS-T18350N
MEMORY: 512MB/133Mhz
OS: REDHAT 7.1 with Default Kernel (2.4.7)
What the problem is : The PBS server after some time freeze, with no 
error message from kernel Just freeze. We have changed everthing (even 
the tower)

Is there any sugestions ?
