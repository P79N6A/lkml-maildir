Subject: 2.2.16 SMP breaks 3c59x.c?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
	I have found that, with my current setup, compiling an SMP kernel
breaks the ethernet driver (3c59x.c) for my card.  I have a dual celeron
400 on a abit BP6 motherboard with a 3com Vortex ethernet (more hardware
information below).  I am running the current debain frozen distribution.
	I have just compiled 2.2.16 with and without SMP (two seperate
source trees, no patches).  I have attached both config files (config-smp
and config-nosmp) and the only difference between them is that I flagged
smp in one and not the other.  I have also attached the output of dmesg
from both smp and non-smp configurations.
	The ethernet driver, under the smp configuration, does not give
any errors or warnings at boot.  I can insmod the module fine, and even
bring up eth0 okay with ifconfig (by hand and via debian scripts).  The
routes are the exact same as without SMP, but I get zero response from
anything outside of my box.  No error messages either (on STDERR or
syslog).
	Unfortunately, I do not know what to try next.  Please let me know
what I can send the list to help figure this out (I have logged the makes
and am willing to do try any reasonable suggestions).  Also, please let me
know if I am making a foolish mistake somewhere.
Thank you for your time,
--Will Gladstone
