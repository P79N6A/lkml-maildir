Having a static function do the work and pass in a "depth" parameter
should be sufficient. As Andi mentioned, a depth of 10 should be plenty.
Like this:
static bool
 globmatch_internal(const char *pat, const char *str, int depth)
{
	if (depth > 10)
		return false;
	[...]
	while (!globmatch_internal(pat+1, str, depth+1))
	[...]
}
bool globmatch(const char *pat, const char *str)
{
	return globmatch_internal(pat, str, 0);
}
Make sure you include a "Signed-off-by:" as well.
