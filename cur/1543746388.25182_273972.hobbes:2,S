Ok, I've built and rebooted to 2.6.10-rc2-bk8, but the magic 
invocation on the kernel command line doesn't seem to have any 
effect.  THat was to append the string
acpi_skip_timer_override
to that line in grub.conf.
A cat of proc/interrupts shows many shared irq's again.
root@coyote linux-2.6.10-rc2-bk8]# cat /proc/interrupts

And, while the rest of the counters are incrementing as expected, the 
ERR: seems to be stuck at 44.  I assume thats good that its not 
incrementing (now) but 2.6.10-rc2 has it as a 0 for extended periods 
of time.
