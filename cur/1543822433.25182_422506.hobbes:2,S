hm, i dont think this is enough. Basically, waking up in priority order 
is just the (easier) half of the story - what you want is to also 
propagate priorities when you block. We provided a complete solution via 
the PI-futex patchset (currently included in -mm).
In other words: as long as locking primitives go, i dont think real-time 
applications should use wakeup-priority-ordered futexes, they should use 
the real thing, PI futexes.
There is one exception: when a normal futex is used as a waitqueue 
without any contention properties. (for example a waitqueue for worker 
threads) But those are both rare, and typically dont muster tasks with 
different priorities - i.e. FIFO is good enough.
Also, there's a performance cost to this. Could you try to measure the 
impact to SCHED_OTHER tasks via some pthread locking benchmark?
