No purpose other than attempting to define sane edge case behavior.
The bitmap interface is completely invisible to the user (who sees UTF8 
strings on the command line), and given the interface I felt the easiest 
thing to do would be to define an "ignore any garbage" default policy.
Due to the way the interface is designed, each userland user must be 
aware of the precise number of valid bits in the bitmap /anyway/, thus 
making clipping/ignoring garbage bits almost a trivial side effect.
