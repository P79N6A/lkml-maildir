Sure, if your root partition is expendable, by all means go ahead.  Ted has 
already offered to start the required changes to e2fsck, which reminds me, I 
have to send the promised docs.  For now, just use normal fsck and it will 
(in theory) turn the directory indexes back into normal file blocks, and have 
no effect on inodes.  Lets take advantage of the opportunity to test that 
feature.  The new improved e2fsck should be capable of re-adding the indexes, 
so we'll get to test that too ;-)
Lets continue this privately and see what's going on with your inode leak.
