Perhaps I haven't made this clear enough.
Nick has been kind enough to review pretty much all of swap prefetch at every 
turn. He is understandably suspicious about any code that I generate since 
I'm a doctor and not a computer programmer. I have addressed every concern he 
has made along the way and even joked at the end that he "threatened to 
review it over and over and over" which he did not take in jest. 
Swap prefetch has actually had far more review than a lot of code so I'm 
surprised that this is a remaning concern.  It has been reviewed, and I have 
addressed the concerns. It is possible to hold back code forever at the 
suggestion that more review is always required, and basically that's what I 
feel this has become.
If there is one valid concern with swap prefetch, there is a numa=64 scenario 
that Rohit Seth brought to my attention and I gave him a patch to test 2 
months ago. I've pinged him since, but I understand he's busy so has not had 
a chance to test the patch.
