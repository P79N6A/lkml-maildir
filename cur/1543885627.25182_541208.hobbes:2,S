I hacked an existing XFS test prog to do manual testing of the fallocate()
syscall. In the XFSQA suite we have various pre-alloc enhanced utils (e.g.
fsstress, fsx, etc) that we should probably update to be able to use both
fallocate and xfsctl so we can test both.
Here's all the programs we use that have preallocation awareness:
chook 982% grep RESVSP ltp/*.c  | awk '/^ltp/  { split($1,a,":"); print a[1] ;}' | uniq
ltp/doio.c
ltp/fsstress.c
ltp/fsx.c
ltp/growfiles.c
ltp/iogen.c
chook 983% grep RESVSP src/* | awk '/^src/ { split($1,a,":"); print a[1] ;}' | uniq
src/alloc.c
src/fstest.c
src/iopat.c
src/randholes.c
src/resvtest.c
src/unwritten_mmap.c
src/unwritten_sync.c
BTW, have you guys tested mmap writes into unwritten extents? ;)
Cheers,
Dave.
