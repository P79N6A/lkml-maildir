For information here are some results when using the process creation
tests "lat_proc fork". Test was run ten times thus the average is
computed with the ten metrics.
with a kernel 2.6.11-rc4-mm1
        max value = 164.0588 msec
        min value = 159.8571 msec
        average   = 161.7012 msec
with a kernel 2.6.11-rc4-mm1 and the cnfork (cn_fork_enable == 0)
        max value = 163.3438 msec
        min value = 159.8857 msec
        average   = 160.9447 msec
with a kernel 2.6.11-rc4-mm1 and the cnfork (cn_fork_enable == 1)
        max value = 177.6885 msec
        min value = 170.9057 msec
        average   = 173.7675 msec
  So we see that when the fork connector is disable the time it takes to
split a process into two copies is the same (and it's normal) and when
the fork connector is enable, it's around 7.5% slower.
Best,
Guillaume
