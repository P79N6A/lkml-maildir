Hi!
I just want to say...
I written (working linux) driver for diamondmm homefree (it does
100KB/sec TCP). Unfortunately, driver is not free [someone asked me
to write driver for them, and they offered quite big money for not
writing it GPL-ed; I could have written driver for free and released
it until GPL, but I just decided I liked money better. sorry] and I
can not release programming details. Driver will be released under GPL
at 12/2000 (feel free to ask me at 1.1.2001 and you'll surely get a
driver :-).
								Pavel
PS: Try to contact me if you are interested in diamondmm homefree
driver. So far I did not see too many people wanting it...
