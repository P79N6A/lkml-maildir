Are you saying remote node will cache a whole page for every byte access
on that page.

Do you write into GDT often for this to be an issue.  The reason I'm
asking this because the per-cpu IDTs that Andi refered in the future.
If we are really not using too many bytes in GDT then rest of the page
can be used for IDT and such mostly RO data.
