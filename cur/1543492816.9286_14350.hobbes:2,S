Um, I've got egg on my face again.  linux-2.2.5/include/asm/spinlock.h has
the following, which makes it quite invalid to mix & match linux object
files compiled with different versions of gcc.  Grrr.
#if (__GNUC__ > 2) || (__GNUC__ == 2 && __GNUC_MINOR__ >= 8)
  typedef struct { } rwlock_t;
  #define RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED (rwlock_t) { }
#else
  typedef struct { int gcc_is_buggy; } rwlock_t;
  #define RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED (rwlock_t) { 0 }
#endif
This means the egcs/linux networking bug is still hiding.
