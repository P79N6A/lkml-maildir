Umm, let's take sshfs, it has a separate "reply processing thread",
that reads replies from the sftp server and then wakes up the relevant
request thread.  The reply processing thread has no direct contact
with the fuse kernel module.  How is freezer supposed to know that
that task in fact also belongs to the server and needs to be kept from
freezing?
Given, it's in the same thread group, but using that is a rather weak
heuristic, as it could easily be a separate process, and likely in
some filesystems it is.
I fear, that your efforts to "save" the freezer are in vain.  It is
already moderately hackish with that PF_FREEZER_SKIP and the kernel
dotted randomly with try_to_freeze() calls, but adding bandaids to try
to order freezing userspace processes in the right order would just
make it a horrible mess.
