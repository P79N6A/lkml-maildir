Is it possible to configure pcf8591 driver using boot time commandline
parameters? 
If yes, where are they described? I didn't find it. (<Help> doesn't say
anything).  also /linux-2.6.10/Documentation/i2c$ fgrep PCF * didn't reveal
anything related.
I only found documentation for module parameters by means of modinfo pcf8591
