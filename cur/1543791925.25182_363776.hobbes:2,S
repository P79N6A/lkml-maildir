Yes, fib_sync_down(), but even when I remove the code setting
RTNH_F_DEAD I still see _some_ local routes disappearing which
I cannot explain right now. I can only reproduce this with
!CONFIG_IP_MULTIPLE_TABLES though.
Assuming this is a separate bug, I'm not sure if this is the right
way to fix it. I think it would be better to rewrite the preferred
source address of all related local routes and only perform a
remove-and-add on the secondary address being promoted.
_If_ we let them die, we should announce it in fib_sync_down()
rather then in the algorithm specific flush routines.
