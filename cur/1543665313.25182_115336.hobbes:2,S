I have a board with cardbus support. And a WLAN card driver with pci
support. So i could not use this WLAN card in this board. So I need to
support Cardbus in the wlan driver.

Electrically, they're different interfaces.  If the controller hardware
you're using doesn't support cardbus cards, no amount of software will
make them work.
Could you give some details about the hardware and the driver?
