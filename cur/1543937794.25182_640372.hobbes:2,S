Very little risk (if any). If printk fails to get the console_sem it
doesn't block. So there would be no waiters on the semaphore, and thus
try_to_wake_up would not be called. The only place I see the down
actually being called is in suspend code, and even then, we would need to
lock the rq of the task that is trying to grab the console_sem and the
deadlock would only occur if that was on the same CPU. And honestly, I'm
not sure that's even possible.
