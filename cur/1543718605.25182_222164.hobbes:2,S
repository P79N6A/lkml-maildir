You are too polite. 
In the past ncpfs was using 'n' with 'all' subcodes assigned to it.
Back when I needed some numbers, I simple shrunk ncpfs to 0x00-0xDF, assigning
0xE0-0xFF to matroxfb (I maintain both, so it is simple...). It looks like that
someone visited ncpfs's assignment since then, as now ncpfs has only 0x00-0x7F
assigned to it (according to the ioctl-numbers; I have no idea who made this
0x80-0xDF hole in my nice range).
On other side, matroxfb uses standard VIDIOC_* v4l2 ioctls for exporting
TV-out's brightness/saturation/... to the userspace. And it causes neverending
pain. Currently Debian's /usr/include headers contain VIDIOC_S_CTRL
definition:
#define VIDIOC_S_CTRL           _IOW  ('V', 28, struct v4l2_control)
while kernel uses
#define VIDIOC_S_CTRL           _IOWR ('V', 28, struct v4l2_control)
and so no apps built with /usr/include headers on Debian do work on matroxfb's
(or anyone else's) v4l2 interface :-( Better to not give description of your ioctls to anyone,
or they'll "fix" them.
