Well, I've used a very simple daemon I wrote for more than a year now on a
vaio, and considering that I sometimes wanted to change it or even stop it,
I clearly prefer it in userspace than in kernel. It was so convenient to
issue a "killall cpufrqd" whenever I wanted 'time' to return accurate values
on a particular process, that I cannot imagine what it would have been if it
had been in the kernel. Moreover, the vaio was unreliable with certain
intermediate frequencies, and it too me a lot of time to discover this
(burnBX was the only reliable trigger). I simply had to change a few lines
in my daemon to use different frequencies and that was all.
Cheers,
Willy
