The possible legal problem of software patents is, up to the present 
time, AFAICT, not producing effects yet in Europe, and is a non-problem 
in jurisdictions like mine (down here neither business methods nor 
software are patentable).

OTOH, the firmware issues *is* a legal real problem (copyright 
infringement is even a criminal offense in a lot of juristictions -- 
down here, 6 months to 2 years of soft jail + fine for non-commercial 
and 2 to 4 years of hard-jail + fine for commercial intents).

You are right, but as I told you, the mirrors are really worse when 
there is a chance of copyrights infringement than of patents 
infringement -- even on those jurisdictions that *have* software 
patents, things are more difficult to prosecute in the patent field.

Conceded. You are right on this.
