Ok, i was just trying to stress that the end result is the same from the

Tell me how i do this in your model:
GPU/VRAM memory clock change power consumption of the card and
the power consumption is often not a trivial function of both of this 
parameters
(i even here simplify the problem by omitting pipeline shutdown). So how 
with
two different separate mode list (one for GPU speed another one for VRAM 
speed)
can you provide consumption information while this consumption depends 
on the
others settings. Then if you give as a solution to make only one list 
you end up
with a more bigger list than previously needed (nrGPUmodes * nrVRAMmodes)
do you expect the user to go through a lengthy list to find what he wants ?
(remember that we will have to add pipeline power off, pll tweaking or many
others way of saving power on such card).
So by choosing this power consumption as a unit of measure you end up
in non trivial case. There is also the question of overclocking, and 
other points
already identified where unfortunately a global design such as your proposal
does not seems to fit properly: local power decision (ethernet, wifi 
card, ...
can power down them self is they are doing nothings but the place where you
can know this is the driver), there is also the child/parent relation, 
how to
estimate power usage (on some configuration one device consumption can
be marginal toward all others things while on other this same device can be
the most power hungry device)... I see all this as bad fit.

You have to provide an ohm plug in (in an ohm world) where policy for 
this device will be
handled and this plug in need to be designed knowing what the hw export 
through HAL.
Yes it's pain full but you don't want to put policy in the driver and to 
do policy you need
knowledge on the things you deal with.

cpufreq is unification of processor frequency management, what you try 
to unify here
can go from toaster (i am sure there is usb driven toaster available 
somewhere on earth
don't ask why) to 100000$ specialized DSP card, we can save power on 
both on them but
how, which policy to follow, and what parameters to tweak will be very 
different. At
least i don't think you will want to driver your specialized DSP card as 
a toaster, personally
i won't.
Oh and as a side note i would like a common interface for dealing with 
power but i just
don't think it's possible, i might be wrong but so far i don't see in 
any other os offering
such things. That said you might be able to factor out _some_ common 
things for
given class of hardware (network card, usb device, graphics cards, ...).
best,
