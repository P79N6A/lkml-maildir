It is the right thing because it self documents which objects really
need a link order and why.  The existing mechanism has demonstrably
failed to do this, resulting in fragile and error prone makefiles.

True, which is one of the reasons that kbuild 2.5 will remove OX_OBJS,
MX_OBJS and MIX_OBJS.  But that change affects all Makefiles, we are
supposed to be in a code freeze.  My patch fixes usb and only affects
usb, not the entire kernel.
