Easy reproducible way: 
Boot with 64M, start 4 setiathome processes, then start mtest (from
memtest suite) with a lot of threads (I'm using 40 readers and 4 writers
in this case, and a 100MB heap)
[root@matrix memtest-0.0.4]# ./mtest -m 100 -r 40 -w 4
Starting test run with 100 megabyte heap.
Setting up 25600 4096kB pages for test...
 done.
