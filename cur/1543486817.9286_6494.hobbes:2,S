Aye. Wish there was a flag that one could use that said something
along the lines of "cease caring about things that cannot be set on
a particular filesystem" and just do it.

Maybe so, but I also have vfat partitions on the HD that I move data
onto from the linux partition. all in all it's very annoying. I expect
the mv command to well... move. I already know the limitations and have
decided I could live with em.
What package is mv in? file-utils? Is such a flag as above possible
without adding something to the kernel that'd allow a filesystem
to report it's capabilities?
