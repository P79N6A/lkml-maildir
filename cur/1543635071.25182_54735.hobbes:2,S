I don't think so.

That's automagic. Process doing freeze will not freeze itself.

Look at the code. freezer will try for 5 seconds, then give up. So, in
rare case module has some threads, rmmod will simply fail. I believe
we can fix rare remaining modules one by one.

Look how freezer works. refrigerator() is blocking, by definition. So
if all processes reach refrigerator(), and the use count == 0, it is
indeed safe to unload.

And that's okay. If it only calls non-sleeping functions, it is not
going to call refrigerator(), and it will exit module code before
calling refrigerator().

I still think it does not.
