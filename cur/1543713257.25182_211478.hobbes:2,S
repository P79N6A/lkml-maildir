I installed SuSE SLES9 beta1 and realized that device mapper 1.00.07-68 
rpm has been installed in the kernel. However it didn't work correctly 
with errors:
Hardware Environment:
pSeries p630 2way Power4+ 1.4GHz 16 GB RAM
pSeries B80 2way Power3 375Mhz 3GB RAM
Software Environment:
SLES9 beta2 with 2.6.4-15-pseries64 kernel
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Installed the system with SLES9 beta1 CDs
2. Upgraded the built kernel to 2.6.4-15-pseries64 using  rpm -ivh 
kernel-pseries64-2.6.4-15.ppc.rpm
3.  Loaded dm_mod: modprobe dm_mod
4. Creating /dev/mapper/control character device with major:10 minor:63 by
executing devmap_mknod.sh
Actual Results:
Tried dmsetup ls and got errors:
   device-mapper ioctl cmd 0 failed: Invalid argument
   Command failed
Expected Results: 
   This a regression since it works fine in the last built kernel: 
2.6.4-9-pseries64
Also, when dmsetup suspend on a device mapper device, it hangs there 
forever.
Do you have any ideas ?
