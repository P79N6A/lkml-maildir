While it does allow for Linux to get certain kinds of drivers quicker, 
it turns hardware developers into slackers who don't want to REALLY 
support Linux and eats away at the spirit of Linux as an open system.
What you're doing may short-term enhance hardware support for Linux, but 
in the long term, it is a set-back for Linux because it does not 
encourage hardware vendors to support Linux directly and even pushes 
true Linux support further into the future.
