I agree with you that direct power management should be made possible,
because there's nothing preventing a very old i386 without any APM nor
ACPI feature in BIOS to suspend correctly on disk. By the way, in such a
case APM or APCI just disable themselves aren't they ? So IMHO swsusp
should have its own /proc way to activate but that may raise conflict
issues with ACPI states.
