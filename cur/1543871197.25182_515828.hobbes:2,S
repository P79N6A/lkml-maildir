Hints & policies for allocation would certainly be useful, but I think
they belong outside this interface.  i.e. you could flag an inode for
whatever allocation you choose, and -then- call posix_fallocate so that
the allocator will take the hints you've given it.
See also this blurb from the posix_fallocate definition:
"It is implementation-defined whether a previous posix_fadvise() call
influences allocation strategy."
FWIW I don't see a lot of point in asking for "strict contiguous blocks"
- the allocator will presumeably try to do this in any case, and I'm not
sure when you would want to fail if you get more than one extent...?
