I think this type of pruning is a good thing, you could even say the
biggest bit of low hanging fruit in terms of size reduction. 
I think your patches are good, but need some work. There are still some
changes that could reduce the kernel further (i.e. when modules are
used) .. So I'm not trying to discourage you, but you set off some
alarms with me early in the thread.. Which caused this to drag out..
