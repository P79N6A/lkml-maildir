Note that Serge said "SELinux re-written on top of Smack", not "rewrite
Smack to be more like SELinux".  I don't believe the former is even
possible, given that Smack is strictly less expressive and granular by
design.  Rewriting Smack to be more like SELinux should be possible, but
seems like more work than emulating Smack on SELinux via policy, and to
what end?
