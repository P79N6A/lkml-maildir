Wild guess: problems with the powersupply. Why do I think this? Because
generating massive amounts of networktraffic via the loopback doesn't
generate the same result.
I have the following machine and use it as a NFS server:
Celeron 300 (oc to 450 MHz)
128 MB
Abit BH6
2 * Digital DE500-BA (21143 chipset)
2 * Maxtor DiamondMax 8.4 GB EIDE (running in RAID0 configuration)
Acer 10X CD-ROM (EIDE)
Panasonic cheap-ass burner (via NCR 810 SCSI controller)
235 watt powersupply
2.2.6 kernel
I tested this system some time ago with a K6-200 (also with a DE500
NIC). I got a NFS performance of about 4.5 MB/sec (regular userland
NFS) even while burning a CD. One NIC is connected to my cable-modem,
the other to the K6 (100baseTX-FD). No instability whatsoever. The
Maxtor disks transfer 11-14 MB/sec (across the entire surface) and the
RAID0 stripset does about 20-21 MB/sec. Somehow I don't think it's
Linux, but I could be wrong.
