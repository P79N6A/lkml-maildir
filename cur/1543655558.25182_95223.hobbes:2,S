Release 0.1.0 of the Open POSIX Test Suite is now available at
http://posixtest.sourceforge.net
.  This early release contains only a small
amount of the initial testing goals.  It contains conformance tests for
POSIX Timers, tags TMR and CS (except THR CS).  The release notes that
appear when downloading the project describe where to find information on
compiling and running the test cases.
The README page and the Open POSIX Test Suite website (above) give more
information on the project goals and progress as well as information on how
to contribute or contact us if you are interested.
The Open POSIX Test Suite is an open source test suite with the goal of
performing conformance, functional, and stress testing of the functions
described in the IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 System Interfaces specification.
Eventual testing of the full specification is desired; however, initial work
is focusing on Timers, Message Queues, Threads, Semaphores, and Signals.
Enjoy!
