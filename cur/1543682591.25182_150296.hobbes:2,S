On my laptop:
Here is the only thing that is similar on my system.  When TCQ is 
enabled, I have filesystem problems (minimal) every time I reboot and it 
nearly always affects the same files every time.  I too am using 
reiserfs.  I usually run reiserfsck and emerge the particular group of 
files.  For a while it was openssl libraries, now it's kde libraries.
Note, reiserfsck never indicates any problems were found or fixed but 
the problems are none-the-less fixed.  (reiser guys: reiserfsck 
--fix-fixable always results in "--fix-fixable ignored")
Also note that there is never any indication ever that something is 
wacky.  Just out of the blue a file or files are corrupt and the bootup 
result is the same every time.

On one of my servers:
TCQ fscks it up bad.  It ran for over a month on .73 with nary an issue 
then all of a sudden it started barfing within hours of boot complaining 
about:
Jul 19 10:55:31 james hdc: invalidating tag queue (0 commands)
Jul 19 10:55:41 james ide_tcq_intr_timeout: timeout waiting for 
completion interrupt
and further disk access causes D state.  I upgraded this machine to 
2.6.0-test1 and now it's having fits with apic or acpi but that's 
another email.  And a side note, if I have TCQ compiled in w/ 
2.6.0-test1, the kernel barfs a long 40+ function OOPS on bootup.  It's 
a 24/7 server so I haven't put a serial cable on it to capture the oops 
yet :/

more if desired.
Other than this, I don't see any filesystem issues.
