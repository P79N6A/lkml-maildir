Another possibility would be to create a meta-device that works like a
cross between the loopback device, and WORM device, I.E. start at the
begining, and allocate sectors sequentially.  Whenever a sector would
normally be overwritten, a new one is allocated instead.  This way,
you could always access the filesystem as it was at any mount in time.
Hypothetically, you could do something like:
mkmetawormdevice /dev/mw0 /dev/hda2
to create a device /dev/mw0, which uses /dev/hda2 for physical
storage.
Then:
write foo to sector 0 of /dev/mw0 - actually writes foo to sector 0 of
/dev/hda2
write bar to sector 1 of /dev/mw0 - actually writes foo to sector 1 of
/dev/hda2
write foobar to sector 0 of /dev/mw0 - actually writes foobar to
sector 2 of /dev/hda2, and notes the date and time that the virtual
'overwrite' happened.
Due to the sequential nature of the writes, the data could even be
compressed quite easily.
John.
