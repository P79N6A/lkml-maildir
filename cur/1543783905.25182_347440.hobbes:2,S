The question is whether ndiswrapper can do stack switching itself. Since
as I understand it the NT stack is way more than 8K. Is there anything
else needed so it (and perhaps in future other 'hard cases') can handle
stacks themselves. We have seperate IRQ stack handling already which
should also help this.
So what is needed to make it go away - specific technical items or just
the persuasive effect of having to fix it ?
