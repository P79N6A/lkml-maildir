Hi,
recently, the family of *at() syscalls and functions (openat, fstatat, 
etc.) have been added to Linux and Glibc, respectively.
In short: I am missing xattr at functions :)
BTW, why is fstatat called fstatat and not statat? (Same goes for 
futimesat.) It does not take a file descriptor for the file argument. 
Otherwise we'd also need fopenat/funlinkat, etc. Any reasons?
Thanks,
	Jan
