Not yet... Alexey Kuznetsov has given me a checklist of things to look for
to make sure that DECnet is correct under SMP operation. I think it probably
is, but I've still to sit down and do the actual check. My main idea was
just to use it for firewalling, but it would be interesting to see if there
are other applications.
I have a large DECnet patch which I'll send in shortly... I sent it to Dave
Miller and its been gradually growing in size since then as I discover more bugs
in the mean time. I hope to see it in before 2.4.xx and I'm going to try and
work on it over the remaining Christmas & New Year Holidays,
Steve.
