 Here we believe in preprocessor: since all PAGE_SIZE, 8, and 
THREAD_SIZE are the constants we expect it will calculate this.
 E.g. here is the result from this line as produced by cross-gcc 
4.2.2:
        lis     r9,0
        rlwinm  r29,r29,2,16,29
        stw     r29,0(r9)
 As you see - only rotate-left, i.e. multiplication to the constant.
 In any case, adding braces as follows probably would be better:
+     max_threads = mempages * (PAGE_SIZE / (8 * THREAD_SIZE));
 Right ?
