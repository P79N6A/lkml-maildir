My terminology is perhaps a bit too subtle: I user "superpage"
exclusively for the case where multiple pages get coalesced into a
larger page.  The "large page" ("huge page") case that you were
talking about is different, since pages never get demoted or promoted.
I wasn't disagreeing with your case for separate large page syscalls.
Those syscalls certainly simplify implementation and, as you point
out, it well may be the case that a transparent superpage scheme never
will be able to replace the former.
