I think there has been to much talk on this list on the above topics.
1/ Many people who talk about legal issues here simply don't know what
they are talking about. Actually quoting from laws and legal texts is much
better than just repeating distorted versions of the truth.
I am sick and tired of the sci.crypt kind of political discussion.
2/ When talking about national laws in an international newsgroup, the
thread usually quickly degenerates into a series of chauvinistic remarks,
like "Oh, that's because in country xxx they have a socialist/fascist
government, WE in our country wouldn't allow such things to happen.". This
is especially true of people who anyway don't know much about what is
discussed (see 1).
For instance, many Americans think France is a police state, and the
reverse is true. Repeated misconception and prejudice is NOT pushing the
discussion forward.
3/ The person that proposed France should be cut from the Linux community
has a tremendous sense of humour, since the author of ext2fs, Rémy Card,
works in an university in Paris.
4/ POLITICAL SPECULATION / INSULTS / COMPARISONS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
KERNEL DEVELOPMENT.
Now let's go on with the REAL business.
