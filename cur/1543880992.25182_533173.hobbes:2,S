nice! I hope CFSv4 kept that good tradition too ;)

i tested heavily swapping systems. (make -j50 workloads easily trigger 
that) I also tested UP systems and a handful of SMP systems. I have also 
tested massive_intr.c which i believe is an indicator of how fairly CPU 
time is distributed between partly sleeping partly running server 
threads. But i very much agree that diverse feedback is sought and 
welcome, both from those who are happy with the current scheduler and 
those who are unhappy about it.
