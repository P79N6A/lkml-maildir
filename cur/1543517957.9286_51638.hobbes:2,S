Are you on drugs? What you are telling about is equivalent to the
statement
that "theoretically one can for example calculate the results of NP hard
problems, so one should be patient and wait for the calculation to
finish".
You seemt to don't know much about the intrinsics of compilers ABI's and
such
in the world out there. Get real please! BTW. Source release gives you
one
thing more which you don't event try to address: Mostly cross platform
compatible drivers. If you care concearned about some wired kind of
"proprietary information which should remain hidden", then at least
you could just release some kind of "precompiled" but in fact obfuscated
C
source as well. At least this way the kernel interface would remain
open,
but the inner workings specific to the driver in mind hidden.

Ahhhhhh! Anounce Anounce this is the first message from the future.
Could you please beam the XFree86 4.0 to me from the future.
I would be eager to see how it will be alike...

Just a question: What is this funny anti trust court case about one
hears
such much last time in the media about. Please enlighten me.
Are are you trying to tell me that Win-Shit won the market due to
suprerioty 
in technology?

Let me paraphrase you: "Win is unstable becouse it is unstable. But the
binary interface for drivers there is rock solid." Ajeee fine logics...

Beeing more stable then Shit 9x is not a great achievement in fact.

OS/2 isn't cross platform too indeed. And OS/2 isn't eactly what I would
call a success and an example one should follow. BTW. What works fine in
a fully controlled developement model doesn't neccessarly must be the
best way to go for something like Linux.

Fortunately we know about C quite well and the compilers we use are
quite OK too.
You hypohtesize on a problem which didn't really show up during the last
several years.

Ohh shit. You are not telling me I should use gcc-2.6-hacked-for-kernel
0.98pl14  still those days. No! Ehem. BTW. What's today called
a i386 processor is quite a different beast from what it was those
days...

Go ahead...

Yess anybody here is seriously interrested in serious bug
reports/improvements!
But there is really no need here to tech us about software engineering

You miss one point. Linux trievs from developement. And even the
kernel currently is far far away from a stage where one could
grave all the needed APIs in stone. Just give us time or help driectly
but don't try to suggest we should starv like strawmanns on the
current stage.

Befor you actually start to develop your own linux distro you could as
well
spend the enegry on the binary only interface you are requesting.
If it turns out to be good --- why not. But please don't hypothesize on
the usefullness of it.
