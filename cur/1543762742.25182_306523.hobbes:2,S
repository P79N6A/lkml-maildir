Is not just about zealotism, propietary drivers have to deal with locking, multiple
architectures and so on, and often they're not very good at that.
Note that this is not a problem only with linux, Windows is suffering the same
every day. Here:

is a good example of how *scary* can be. This is what happens in a OS where a 
certification process is needed. I don't want to know what are they doing in linux,
where such certification doesn't exist.....
