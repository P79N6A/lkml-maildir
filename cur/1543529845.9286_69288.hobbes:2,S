The current log buffer is 16384 bytes in length. It's in
../linux/kernel/printk.c. If you are using printk() to log something
that you can't keep up with, you are either logging to a very slow
drive, or you are logging way too much data. printk() was not designed
to be a general-purpose logging device. It's supposed to handle logging
failures while minimizing the resources used so there is a good chance
that it actually gets logged somewhere.
If you are trying to log network activity, you need to use tcpdump
or some write-your-own user space utility.
