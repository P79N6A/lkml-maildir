I will double check.  I wonder if this is the cause, because the network is 100
Mbps, but the router is switching only at 64kbps.

We have a hub, and not a switch.  Can this be the reason?  BTW, how come that a
duplex issue can result in such huge degradations?

Not in linux, may be the way they have _used_ linux on the router ;-)
