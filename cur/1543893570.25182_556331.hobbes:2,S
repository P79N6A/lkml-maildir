Sorry, that didn't work either. One problem is that you're using
ARCH_KMALLOC_MIN_ALIGN instead of ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN in slub_defs.h
to determine KMALLOC_MIN_SIZE. After fixing that, it fails with
undefined references to __kmalloc_size_too_large. It looks like ilog2()
is behaving strangely; I'll see if I can figure out what's going on.
