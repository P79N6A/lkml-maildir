Thanks, Roman.
To avoid misunderstandings:
I in fact invest more time and energy in testing mm- or other kernels than any comparable user or admin. I in fact tested 3 or 4 different ones somewhere between 2.6.17 and 2.6.18-rc1-mm1, but got exhausted and demotivated as the only output was inability to boot.
I informed Andrew as quick as possible. And I never in my life stumbled over kernels behaving like this. In so far as a consequence I am missing tools or tricks how to produce system output for constructive feedback.
 Question: What difference is there between the output of dmesg when kernel stops out of inconvenience or just out of containing buggy code on the one hand and the output of SysRq+P or Alt+ScrollLock on the other hand?
Regards
Uwe
