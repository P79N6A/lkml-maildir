Hi All,
I have developed a USB host controller driver,
and at the time of development,
i had enables the USB and EHCI debug ,mesages.
Now i have removed them from the kernel configuration.
But when i insert a pendrive in the Host port, i see the Debug mesages
on the shell.
Does anybody have some idea about how to stop
these debug messages coming on shell.
Regards
conio
