Chris. 
Indeed we do change timeslice with nice on rt_tasks in mainline at the moment. 
Truth is most rt programming couldn't care less about timeslices, but your 
point about it deviating from the standard is valid. RSDL does not change 
timeslice with nice on SCHED_RR tasks so it's sort of getting addressed by 
proxy.
