ok, here are the results:
Using 2.6.22-rc3 I get lot's of hi during TX and lots of hi and si during RX.
Using 2.6.22-rc3-mm1 hi and si are significantly lower.
It's difficult to give absolute numbers, because top refreshes very slow, but 
with 2.6.22-rc3 hi is about 30% during TX and RX and si is 0% during TX and 
50% during RX. With Using 2.6.22-rc3-mm1 hi is 0% during TX and 0.3% during 
RX and si is 10% during TX and 0% during RX.
When I do the same test on both kernels I get about 10 times (yes, it's really 
about ten times like in your example) more interrupts with 2.6.22-rc3 than 
with 2.6.22-rc3-mm1.
An additional thing I noticed it that it's not the BCM4401 card that stops 
working but my e100 card. If I take the e100 card down and up again the 
connection is working again, so the BCM4401 doesn't have a "stops working" 
bug for me.
