On Wed, 11 Oct 2000 09:56:46 -0400, Horst von Brand blurted forth:
>  - RH 7 ships a gcc patched from CVS sources in order to take advantage of
>    better (on ix86 mainly) optimizations on userland
>  - RH 7 ships kgcc for compiling the kernel, as the 2.2 kernels are known to
>    be broken and not compilable with new gcc's
>  - No, the kernel won't be fixed. The work is huge, and the risk is much too
>    high
>  - Yes, 2.4 should compile with new gcc's. But then again, it isn't (and
>    probably won't be, at least for some time) a supported configuration
