Hi again,
I have been able to reproduce the locking-up behaviour! It occurs every
time I start Mozilla (0.9.2) or gtkEmbed. Other memory intensive programs
(GIMP) don't have that behaviour.
Strangely enough, the system remains mostly functional: I can switch
consoles, X and Enlightenment remain responsive, I can even execute some
programs. But programs that deal with mozillas /proc entries just hang. top
and ps hang; also if I cd into /proc/<mozilla's pid> and do an ls *block*;
you can't even kill it with CTRL-C. Listing other subdirs works fine though.
Other things that hang are w and xdm-greeter.
Considering these symptoms, it seems to be more of an issue with mozilla
than with the kernel. Still, I don't know why the ls /proc/mozilla should
block. Also things work perfectly with kernel 2.4.6-pre5.
Can anybody reproduce the symptoms, tell me whether this is a problem with
the kernel, mozilla or both, or provide me with other insight? I'd
appreciate it very much!
Bye
Felix
