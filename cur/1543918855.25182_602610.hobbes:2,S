Finding quotes from old threads does not in any way prove your point.
And you see to get things wrong too.
There were complains that menuconfig was flickering when it used
lxdialog as a standalone executable which was addressed.
It was not addresses by a tolal rewrite we just integrated the lxdialog
functionality with kconfig - issue closed.
There were talks about shell based parsers or not. We ended up
selecting a design with a common backend shared by several frontends.
The frotends you know as oldconfig, menuconfig, xconfig and gconfig.
And the same backend <-> multiple frontends design you claim are broken
and continue your ranting about shell scripting.
But you have somehow skrewed up the facts here.
There are no one having big issue with netiehr kconfig nor kbuild.
And as being maintainer for kbuild and for some parts of kconfig
I am getting quite feed up with your continous ranting that they
are both in such a bad shape that a rewrite is needed.
And until now you have not given one single example of real
problems that will be solved by a total rewrite and cannot
be solved otherwise.
