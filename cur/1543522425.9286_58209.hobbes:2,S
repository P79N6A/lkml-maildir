The problem is a resource issue/bug in the kernel, that kudzu (the new
RedHat 6.1 hardware detection tool) trips.  Those resource issues will be
resolved in kernel 2.4.
Kudzu probes for serial ports, and causes problems later when the PCMCIA
code brings up the modem along with a new serial port.
Another "fix" is to edit /etc/rc.d/init.d/kudzu and add "--safe" to the
command line for kudzu.
