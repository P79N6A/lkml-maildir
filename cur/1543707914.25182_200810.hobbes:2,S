I completely understand what you're saying.  I have seen enough threads 
where someone refused to test patches.  So let me be more specific.
I'll have to test the kernel on two other machines for a few days before 
I put it on this particular machine.  Unfortunately, both of them have < 
1.5GB ram.
So let me know which patches are most likely to fix this problem.
PS, if I can apply them to my 2.6.1 kernel, then I wouldn't have to run 
the base kernel to compare changes of 2.6.1 -> 2.6.3 -> 2.6.3-mm -> your 
patch.
Each step would require a week-day to get a fair compairison.
