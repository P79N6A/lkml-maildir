According to the latest figures, 621 million ARM processors were
shipped in Q3, which equates to about 78 processors per second.
(taken from 
http://www.arm.com/news/15300.html
).
I'd like to know the figures for these other so-called "popular
architectures".
But in any case that's an utterly irrelevant point to the argument
at hand.

As proven previously the reverse is also true.  And as shown previously
the cheaper out of the two for all platforms is the LL/SC based
implementation, where the architecture specific implementation can
be _either_ LL/SC based or cmpxchg based depending on what is
supported in their hardware.
I'm going to keep saying this until people get it.
