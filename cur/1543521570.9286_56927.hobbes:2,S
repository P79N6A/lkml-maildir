IIRC, you don't have to ship it; you only need to make the source to *what 
you ship* (that part is correct) available for free upon request.  Shipping 
it with the product is probably the easiest way to do this; putting it on an 
FTP site with a pointer to it in the docs would also be sufficient, as long 
as nobody gets the idea that they can remove it to save space later because 
it's obsolete.

    We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
