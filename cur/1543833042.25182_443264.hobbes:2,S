hmm I could have sworn this was taken care of already, 
Acked-by: Arjan van de Ven <arjan@linux.intel.com>
thinking about it... prior to adding randomization, there already was 8K
randomization of the stack pointer.. we probably only made the new
randomization conditional on the personality..
(and to be honest for performance reasons you really really want that 8K
at least on the netburst architectures)
