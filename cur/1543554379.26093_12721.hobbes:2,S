In my experience, if you try to send large messages over unreliable
networks (we sometimes see 50 or more % losses due to chronical link
overload downstream) the connection breaks up and the messages take a long
time to get out of the door. No, not just Linux; our SunOS/Solaris/Linux
mail servers have all shown the same behaviour. Makes sense: Unless the
message is sent and ACKed, it stays put. SMTP has no "resume message" AFAIK...
This could also be an explanation for this phenomemnon.
