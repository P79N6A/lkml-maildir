-- Snipped from the patch --
If the handler actually handles the NMI, it should return NOTIFY_OK.
If it did not handle the NMI, it should return NOTIFY_DONE.  It may "or"
on NOTIFY_STOP_MASK to the return value if it does not want other
handlers after it to be notified.

Am I reading this correctly? As long as no one passes back NOTIFY_STOP_MASK,
all handlers are run. Assuming that all external NMI sources have a means of
checking whether they were the source, this would work like shared PCI
interrupts.

So... We're running through the handler list servicing an NMI, two more NMIs
come in and we latch one (the other is dropped). It doesn't matter. Either
the
affected handlers have not run yet and will get run on the current pass, or
they will run on the next pass. You may have two handlers run on a single
pass
but you should not drop any. True??
This assumes i386 architecture and all handlers are run. I don't know about
other archs.
