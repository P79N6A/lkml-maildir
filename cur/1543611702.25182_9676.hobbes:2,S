You said 'assume i386', but just to make it clear - this is likely to break
horribly on some non-i386 platforms, due to dcache aliasing. You may find
that the second mmap(MAP_FIXED) fails, or if it succeeds then changes made
with one virtual address won't be instantly visible through the other
mapping. About the best case on such hardware is that Linux will just map
the offending page uncached.
