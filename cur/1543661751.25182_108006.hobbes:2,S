The CyrixIII compile option should not generate cmov.
If you can objdump -D vmlinuz and grep for cmov, and find out
where thats being generated to confirm that it is that could be useful.
Which gcc did you use? And (silly question), did you make mrproper
before building the cyrix3 kernel ? If there were left behind .o
files, that could confuse it. Possibly ccache too.
if you were using that rm -rf ~/.ccache to be sure.
as a sidenote, the new C3s (Nehemiah) now have CMOV.
