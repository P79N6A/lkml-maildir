Also explaining the rotation of those two trees would be useful (I
suppose some other subsystems too use somewhat similar rotation). I.e., 
net-2.6.26.git will eventually be opened and new development should be 
based on it (whenever such tree with a future version number is 
available), and that tree then becomes net-2.6.git once 2.6.25 is out. 
net-2.6.git is usually for fixes only unless merge window is currently 
open. These things come up quite often.
