No, in fact the kernel isn't written in ANSI C. :)
If nothing else, the fact that it uses a lot of gcc-specific
extensions rules that out.  And it assumes that you can freely cast
pointers to unsigned longs and back again.  I'm sure others can add to
this list.

Sure the kernel is non-conforming.  "Conforming" means that the
program will run the same on any architecture, and the Linux kernel
surely won't do that - it won't get very far on a PDP-10, I can assure
you. :)
