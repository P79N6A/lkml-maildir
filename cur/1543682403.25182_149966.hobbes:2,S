Yes, handled by this part of the patch:
@@ -976,10 +983,11 @@
 	 * us from recursively trying to free more memory as we're
 	 * trying to free the first piece of memory in the first place).
 	 */
-	tsk->flags |= PF_MEMALLOC|PF_KSWAPD;
+	tsk->flags |= PF_MEMALLOC|PF_KSWAPD|PF_IOTHREAD;
Without that change, nothing got swapped to disk. It looks like
__alloc_pages(GFP_ATOMIC,...) only wakes up the kswapd threads. Is the
pdflush threads needed during memory freeing? My patch leaves them
unrefrigerated too, but Pavel said that wasn't safe for some reason.
