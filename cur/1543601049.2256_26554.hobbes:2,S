What do you think by this? You can use 'pserver' from ncpfs, which
attaches to some job queue on Netware server and processes jobs in the
queue.
If you are talking about rprinter protocol, then you are lost, as rprinter
needs SPX, and SPX implementation in Linux is a bit fragile - and besides
that, you can configure Netware Printserver to use lpd protocol, so there
is no need for that.
If you have further questions, you should join linware@sh.cvut.cz (send
subscribe linware to listserv@sh.cvut.cz), IPX & NCP are discussed there
(long ago there was linux-ipx on vger.rutgers.edu, but it is really long
time ago).
