Agreed, not an option we'd want to use.

First half agreed, second half not sure.  Maybe no series at all.
Could it be worked with just the one serie, and count in task_struct
of kmaps "raised" by task, only task with count >=1 allowed to take
the last N kmaps?  I suspect something like that would work if not
scheduling otherwise, but no good held across allocating another
resource e.g. memory in fault.  Probably rubbish, not thought out
fully, just mentioned in case it gives you an idea.  Another such
half-baked idea I've played with a little is using one or two ptes
of the user address space (e.g. at top of stack) as per-task kmaps.

Nice if that's so, but I think you're sadly deluded ;-)
Imagine sys_read going to file_read_actor (kmap, __copy_to_user, kunmap),
imagine the __copy_to_user faulting (needs to kmap the pagetable),
imagine the place faulted is hole in ???fs file (kmap in clear_highpage),
imagine low on memory schedules all over.
There's more I want to consider in your mail, these were
just a few points I felt I could say something on quickly.
