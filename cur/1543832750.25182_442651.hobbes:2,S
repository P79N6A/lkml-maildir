For this to happen, either A has to be at a lower priority than the irq
tasks or the interrupt has to be a hard irq (e.g., scheduling clock
interrupt).  In the first case, the added cleanup processing seems
inconsequential compared to (say) an interrupt doing network protocol
processing.  In the second case, B does not do its put_task_struct()
until after the hard irq returns (because the put_task_struct() is invoked
from a call_rcu() callback), which makes the above scenario unlikely,
though perhaps not impossible.
If the second scenario is in fact possible, would you be willing to
supply the appropriate deferral code?  I believe we both agree that RCU
is not really the right deferral mechanism in this situation.
