It looks like it is recognized. Bit 1 in the caps word tells if the
touchpad supports multi-finger detection. Earlier kernels used to
report this in plain text form, but it was considered bloating dmesg
unnecessarily, so now you only get the raw capability bits reported.
Anyway, you also need to use the X driver from

to take advantage of multi-finger taps. The kernel itself doesn't bind
any special actions to them.
