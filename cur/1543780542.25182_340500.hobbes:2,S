Right -- except that my consumer is quite fast enough in the average 
case; it's only the worst case where it can't keep up.  Extending the 
queue would allow it to catch up with such bursts of activity without 
dropping requests.  The low- and mid- hanging fruit has already been 
picked as far as consumer optimization goes; anything remaining is quite 
high indeed.

I expected to demonstrate the problem. :)
