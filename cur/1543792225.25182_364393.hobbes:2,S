I have been inconvenienced by lack of cmpxchg across all architectures
a number of times -- one can often work around it, but...
Here are the places that check __HAVE_ARCH_CMPXCHG in 2.6.14:
o	arch/i386/kernel/acpi/boot.c <global> 85 #ifndef __HAVE_ARCH_CMPXCHG
	Warning message saying that ACPI must use 486 or later.
	Should be able to get rid of this, though not sure what you
	have to do to ACPI.
o	include/asm-i386/mc146818rtc.h <global> 16 #ifdef __HAVE_ARCH_CMPXCHG
	Provides __cmpxchg()-based code for 486 and better, and assumes
	that 386 is UP.  Should be able to eliminate the 386 code and
	the #ifdef.
o	include/linux/rcuref.h <global> 47 #ifdef __HAVE_ARCH_CMPXCHG
o	kernel/rcupdate.c <global> 76 #ifndef __HAVE_ARCH_CMPXCHG
o	lib/dec_and_lock.c <global> 6 #ifdef __HAVE_ARCH_CMPXCHG
	Looks like you have these three covered.
There are about 50 uses of cmpxchg, and it is possible that some of them
would be simplified by your primitives, as well.
So having cmpxchg available would be a very good thing!
						Thanx, Paul
