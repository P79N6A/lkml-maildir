Content-Disposition: inline
drivers/pci/search.c caused following section mismatch warning
(if compiled with CONFIG_HOTPLUG=n):
WARNING: drivers/pci/built-in.o - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text: from .text.pci_find_bus after 'pci_find_bus' (at offset 0x24)
This was due to pci_find_bus() calling a function marked __devinit.
Fix was to remove the __devinit from the offending function.
