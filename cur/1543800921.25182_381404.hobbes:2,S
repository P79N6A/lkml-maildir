oh yeah. why is linux so fscking big? my olde msdos would fit on one 
floppy. whiiine.
what a load of crap. alsa is a serious architecture meant for serious, 
maximally efficient usage with all kinds of (wildly different) hardware.
desktop stuff and "you have mail" beeps are a fscking corner case.
this is like whining about the oh so complex networking infrastructure 
and iptables and constantly reminiscing how simple it used to be to set 
up a modem on /dev/ttyS0.
get real.
