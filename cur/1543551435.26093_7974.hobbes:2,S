I would like to see this happen, and would like to offer to 
help.  I have a NW 3.12 system and a Linux 2.2.17 system on 
10base2.  I am currently trying to get an spx client on Linux 
to talk to an spx server on Netware.  I would not currently 
be comfortable coding in the network drivers, but can test 
things.  FYI: in the current 2.2 code, the connect shows up 
on the Netware server, but never returns in the Linux client.
Thanks, and not subscribed to the list,
