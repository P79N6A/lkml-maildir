And how many different formats will be used for thumbnails? How many
different names to indicate a summary for a document?
Having the ability to add attributes standardizes a way to access that
data, but not the format and naming of those attributes. It could be
a step closer to a more flexible way of handling storage, but you have
to realize that a lot (if not most) of the work still needs to be done
in userspace.
