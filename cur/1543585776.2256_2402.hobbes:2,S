I don't believe that's the ncr53c8xx driver.  That looks like the
53c7,8xx driver.  I don't think it's really maintained any more, or
frankly that it could ever handle a 53c896 card, which could explain
it only seeing the 810a and not the 896 your boot disk is on.
You really want to use the sym53c8xx driver anyway - it is the one
being worked on in earnest now.  I believe it will pick up 810a
controllers as well.
(yes that's three ncr/symbios/lsi drivers in the kernel - "53c7,8xx",
"ncr53c8xx" and "sym53c8xx" ...)
