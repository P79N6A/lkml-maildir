AFAIK newer glibc = CVS glibc but the malloc() tune parameters
work via environment variables for the current stable ones as well,
e.g. to overcome the above "out of memory" one could do,
% export MALLOC_MMAP_MAX_=1000000
% export MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_=0
% magma
At default, on a 32bit Linux current stable glibc malloc uses brk
between 0x08??????-0x40000000 and max (MALLOC_MMAP_MAX_) 128 mmap if
the requested chunk is greater than 128 kB (MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_).
If MAGMA mallocs memory in less than 128 kB chunks then the above out
of memory behaviour is expected.
