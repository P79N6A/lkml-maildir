If you have to study some given sub-system, why not, you might have to
look at how this evolved from years to years, that must already be a
huge work from 2.0 to now for any single part of the kernel.
But seriously, if it's already virtually impossible to get a real
picture of the overall kernels, trying to figure out all changes from
1.0 to now, for all subsystems sounds a little illusory. Moreover they
might have just been all rewritten several times since.
But perhaps what Vijayakumar was looking for is more the different
feature that were added within the curse of years (eg : SMP) ?
