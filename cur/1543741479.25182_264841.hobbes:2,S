Yes it is!
 	Task 1			NMI
 	-------			----
 	Sets index register
 				Sets index register to something else
 	Reads wrong value
The NMI, by definition can't be masked so there is nothing that
can be done with interrupts to prevent task 1 from getting
the wrong value except spin-locks.
Anybody who accesses that shared device must use that device's
spin-lock and the lock must be obtained prior to caching the
shadow value.
