Perhaps. In these spamridden days, mailinglists that don't have the kind of 
(human and other) resources behind them that linux-kernel has basically have 
the choice between drowning in spam, becoming subscriber only or moderate 
non-subscribers and of these, that third option is "best among the bad".
alsa-devel for example also went this route -- the spam levels simply 
weren't tolerable anymore for any subscriber and the list was dying as a 
result. Moderation sucks, but subcriber-only sucks even worse (generally, 
and/but even more so for lists that expect crossposts from linux-kernel) so 
what's a small-time list to do.
Moderation takes some effort so the lists that moderate have made the 
explicit choice to not become subscriber-only. While subscriber-only 
certainly is useful to mention alongside the list address itself, I'm not 
too sure mentioning moderation makes a great deal of sense actually -- if 
all's well, the moderator will simply approve it and you don't have to deal 
with it other than that.
Rene.
