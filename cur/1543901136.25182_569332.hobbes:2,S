I think this is far more complicated then it needs to be.
it sounds like it should be possible to do the following
1. figure out what pages should be backed up (creating a data structure to 
hold them)
2. kexec into the hibernate kernel (this step handles all device 
transitions today)
3. have the hibernate userspace find the data structures created in step 
#1
4. have the hibernate userspace write the pages somewhere in the suspend 
format.
5. have the hibernate kernel power down the box.
the only things here that sounds like they're not available in stock 
kernels are steps #1 and #3.
now this won't do the fancier suspend-to-ram-and-disk and it won't let you 
go back from the hibernate kernel to the main kernel, but it should be 
enough to let you do the suspend safely and reliably.
for the restore, as I understand it the process is
1. boot a kernel, any working kernel.
2. read the suspend formatted data from wherever it was saved and feed it 
to /dev/suspend
