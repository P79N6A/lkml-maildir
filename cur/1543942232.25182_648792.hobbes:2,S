It never happens that two threads writes to two different physical
pages by working on the same process virtual address. This is an issue
only for KVM which is probably ok with it but certainly you can't
consider the dependency on the page-pin less fragile or less complex
than my PT lock approach.

That will make the follow_page fast path even slower if it has to
lookup a rbtree or a list of locked ranges. Still not comparable to
the PT lock that 1) it's zero cost and 2) it'll provide an even more
granular scalability.

The apps using GRU/KVM never trigger large
munmap/mremap/do_exit. You're optimizing for the irrelevant workload,
by requiring unnecessary new locking in the GRU fast path.
