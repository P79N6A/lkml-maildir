With the sheduler work Ingo and I have been doing I was wondering if there was 
possibly a problem with requeuing kernel threads at certain intervals? Ingo's 
current version requeues all threads at 25ms and I just wondered if this 
number might be a multiple or factor of a magic number in the AS workings, as 
we're seeing a few changes in behaviour with AS only. I'm planning on leaving 
kernel threads out of this requeuing, but I thought I could also pick your 
brain.
