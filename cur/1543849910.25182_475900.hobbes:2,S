What I was worry about is that you actually wrote a frame buffer
driver, which are normally located in drivers/video, and put it in a
new directory drivers/auxdisplay. So now we have two places for frame
buffer drivers. It looks like, now some frame buffer drivers in
drivers/video should be moved in drivers/auxdisplay, shouldn't it ?
Maybe just a stupid idea but why not restructuring the thing like:
		drivers
		|-- display
		|      |-- video
		|      |-- aux
		|      |-- fbmem.c
		|      |-- ...
Another point: does the ks0108 controller is only used with the 'cfag'
display ? If not, suppose I'm using the same controller with another
lcd different from 'cfga'...Am I supposed to reuse your code in
cfag12864b.c ?
BTW, did you try to mmap your fbdev ? Does it work ?
Thanks
