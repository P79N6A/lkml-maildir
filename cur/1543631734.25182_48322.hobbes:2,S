Could you also split 
	Pentium-Pro/Celeron/Pentium-II     CONFIG_M686
into
	Pentium-Pro            CONFIG_M686
	Pentium-II/Celeron     CONFIG_MPENTIUMII
Gcc-3.1 has also a -march=pentium2 specific target, that is not a synomym
for any other.
BTW, I think an option to enable -mmmx would also be useful. Nothing more,
because afaik sse is only floating point.
