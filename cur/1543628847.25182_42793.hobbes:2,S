Unfortunately, I was recalling some article I read last year that said you
needed upgraded firmware (such as upgraded motherboard or new PCI card) to
get > 137GB support.  I should have verified that my information was still
correct.
And here I made sure the motherboard I bought this month had 133 support so
I could use future large hard drives on it :)  At least I finally have
support for my ATA100 drives at something faster than ATA33.

Hi Kevin,

That actually turns out not to be the case.
While you do need a new controller if you want to use ATA133, the LBA48
addressing scheme in no way depends on ATA133. Running a 160GB disk on your
old ATA100 (or ATA66 or ATA33) controller works just fine.
Bye, Martin
