With respect to security issues, there have been some of them in the past
months, and at least some of them were not fixed back them with the
argument of "development release, will be fixed".
It seems that Alan Cox was the one to keep track of these security
problems, but now that he is on his sabbatical year maybe some of the
fixes are still pending, because nobody remembers there were any ;-)
Are these problems already fixed, and I missed them, or there are still
some to be addressed ?.
