Hello
Im trying to use more than 10 ide controllers on a 2.4.26 kernel and i
did not succeed.
i patched already according to several posts (Alan Cox) so now i get :
PDC20269: ROM enabled at 0xfdee0000
~    idea: BM-DMA at 0xdf50-0xdf57, BIOS settings: hdu:pio, hdv:pio
~    ideb: BM-DMA at 0xdf58-0xdf5f, BIOS settings: hdw:pio, hdx:pio
but unfortunately :
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
ide3 at 0xdfa0-0xdfa7,0xdfaa on irq 23
ideb: UNABLE TO GET MAJOR NUMBER 0
i guess i need to patch major and minor numbers for the devices as well
but i did not reach to.
i search into Documentation/devices.txt without sucess.
Does anyone know what are major/minors for hdu, hdv, hdw, hdx ?
Thks a lot for your help.
