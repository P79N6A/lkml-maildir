I'm not. They also need to get permission from the network before they
write to the disk, and they're not going to get permission without
hearing back from everybody. Besides, since the same network is used
to connect to the disks as is used to connect the computers to each
other, how would it be able to access the disks without being able to
access other computers which also connect to the disks?
