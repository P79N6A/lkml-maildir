Subject: strace needs oop-instruction for ARM

straec currently fails to trace fork() on the ARM architecture
since it doesn't have the right loop instruction for that architecture:
	#if defined (I386)
	#define LOOP    0x0000feeb
	#elif defined(ARM)
	#define LOOP -1  /* almost certainly wrong, jws */
Can someone tell me what the proper instruction is?
Wichert.
