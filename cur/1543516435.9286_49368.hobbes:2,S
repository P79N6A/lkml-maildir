Hi out there!
We found the following problem with linux kernel 2.2.10 and Solaris
(Version 2.5 & 2.5.1) NFS (x86). During compiler runs in big projects
via nfs we had sometimes the case that written data on NFS-Server was
corrupt. This is of course a really serious effect. It seems so that
this problem accours since linux kernel 2.2.6. With kernel 2.2.5ac4 the
problem doesn't accours. Also it is important which OS servs the NFS.
The combination Linux with kernel 2.2.10 & f.e. Digital Unix 4.0d has no
problems.
Our exact environment:
----------------------
NFS-Client:
- SuSE-Linux 6.2
- with kernel 2.2.10 (not the distr. kernel from SuSE) 
  ...Problem accours also with SuSE kernel 2.2.10
NFS-Server:
- Solaris x86 2.5 or 2.5.1 
1) Is this Problem anywhere else known?
2) Is there a patch for the newer linux kernel that could solve this
problem?
