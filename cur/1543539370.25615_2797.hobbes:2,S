Desktop audio/visual is soft and must be supported in Linux for modern
systems or it (linux) will not have any chance at succeeding on the desktop.
Studio/mixing audio/visual is firm and should be supported in Linux but it is
ok to specify constrained hardware choices to get better results.
Live audio/visual may be closer to hard and given the cost of retakes may
make using RT extensions such as LXRT or RTAI reasonable.
