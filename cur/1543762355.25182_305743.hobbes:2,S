I had looked at hw_random,  but it seemed a little platform specific (x86),
and it doesn't currently have a way for RNG providers to register themselves.
Admittedly I did not know how it's output was being used in practice.
The drivers I am working with do crypto/public key and RNG.  Not all of
them can easily have the RNG support taken from the driver and plugged
into hw_random.c,  since it is (in most cases) a single PCI chip with
it's own  registers, initialisation and configuration,  that,  IMO
belongs in the driver for the particular chip.
Not that it isn't possible,  but hw_random would start supporting a
much larger number of HW variants and I think it would get ugly.
It would be possible to add a "register" interface to hw_random so that
you can register other RNG's easily.  This would seem reasonable.
I work on fairly resource constrained embedded devices a lot of the
time, so when I can avoid adding applications and reduce kernel size,
I do.  Thus my motivation to add a simple API for adding entropy to
/dev/random.
Cheers,
