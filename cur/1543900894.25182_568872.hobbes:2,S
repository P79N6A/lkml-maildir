Alan:
Can this be ignored, or is it a case of a patch papering over a real
problem?  It seems possible that some serial driver is leaving device
IRQs enabled after it has unregistered itself as an interrupt handler.

------- Comment #4 from dannf@dannf.org  2007-07-12 20:07 -------
I attempted to reproduce this today under 2.6.22 and was unable to. I then used
git bisect to try and identify the changeset that fixed the issue and ended up
with the one below.
I wonder if this should be considered a security issue (DoS)?

    Clear spurious irq stat information when adding irq handler
    Any newly added irq handler may obviously make any old spurious irq
    status invalid, since the new handler may well be the thing that is
    supposed to handle any interrupts that came in.
    So just clear the statistics when adding handlers.
