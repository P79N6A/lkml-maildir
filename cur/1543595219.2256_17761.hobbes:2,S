Dynamic loading of executables has been in QNX for as long as I know
it (fifteen years).
With the appearance of QNX version 4 some ten years ago came 32-bit
address space, full memory management/protection etc.

QNX 2 did not have any memory protection.

Of course QNX has changes radically over the decades (it's been
around for some twenty years now); what I frowned at was that
you made your statements as if they would apply to the *current*
state of affairs, which they certainly do not.
