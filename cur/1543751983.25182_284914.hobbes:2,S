SGI and Kernel Maintainers,
	With the permission of my employer, SBS Technologies, Inc., I have
released a patch for 2.4 kernels that supports the 520 Series of WAN
adapters.  (A similar patch for 2.6 kernels will soon follow)  The driver
itself has been tested by many customers, but as of this morning, the patch
has only been tested by me.
       I have created a Source Forge project for the patch/GPL driver, which
can be viewed at the following location:
"
https://sourceforge.net/projects/sbs520lnxdrv/".
  The patch can be
downloaded directly from the following link:
"
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sbs520lnxdrv/sbs520patch.bz2?download"
       It would be great to receive some feedback on our work, and we hope
that this driver will eventually be added to the kernel.
Best regards,
Adam
