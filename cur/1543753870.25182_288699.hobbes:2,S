Hi,
it looks like 2.6.10 (which I was using) - serio ports are detected ok 
(both on 0x60,0x64, keyboard irq 1, aux irq 12), keyboard also (AT 
Keyboard Translated Set 2 on isa0060/serio) and nothing - while 
detection NumLock (set by BIOS) is turned off and keyboard is dead. 
Maybe someone would be so kind and compare keyboard driver 
hadrware-level parts and (possibly) post patch reversing any changes 
since 2.4? Any other ideas?
(I use the newest gcc-3.3 if it matters.)
