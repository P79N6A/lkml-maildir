I have encountered a certain weird problem today with the FreeBSD
disklabels. The computer I am transferring data from has two IDE disks -
one of them has one FreeBSD slice and 6 partitions on it. The other one
has two (!) FreeBSD slices: 4 partitions on the first ones and 2 on the
second one. The problem is, that while kernel 2.0.36 (which is the
standard kernel distributed with Debian Slink), sees all the slices AND
the logical partitions on both disks, kernel 2.2.13 sees all the slices,
and all the partitions on the first slice, but it doesn't see partitions
on the second slice. So, while the partition read on 2.0.36 looks like
this:
hdb: hdb1 < hdb5 hdb6 hdb7 hdb8 > hdb2 < hdb9 hdb10 >
on 2.2.13 (with compiled FreeBSD disklabel support) it looks like this:
hdb: hdb1 hdb2 < hdb5 hdb6 hdb7 hdb8 >
My question is: Is there any way (short of downloading the U2FS driver for
2.0.36 and using the old kernel) that the Linux system would see and
recognize the partitions on the second slice? Please reply as quickly as
you could, because this problem is urgent (I have to transfer the data on
those partitions in order to install a new Linux system there).
