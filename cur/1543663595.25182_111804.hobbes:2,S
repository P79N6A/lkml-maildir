What's nice about x86-64 is that it runs existing 32 bit apps fast and 
doesn't suffer from the blisteringly small caches that were part of your 
rant.  Plus, x86-64 binaries are not horrifically bloated like ia64.  
Not to mention that the amount of reengineering in compilers like 
gcc required to get decent performance out of it is actually sane.

HPET is part of one of the PCYY specs and even available on 32 bit x86, 
there are just not that many bug free implements yet.  Since x86-64 made 
it part of the base platform and is testing it from launch, they actually 
have a chance at being debugged in the mass market versions.
