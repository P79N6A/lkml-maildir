Subject: [PATCHSET] 0/15 IO scheduler improvements
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
This is a continuation of the patches posted yesterday, I continued
to build on them. The patch series does:
- Move the hash backmerging into the elevator core.
- Move the rbtree handling into the elevator core.
- Abstract the FIFO handling into the elevator core.
- Kill the io scheduler private requests, that require allocation/free
  for each request passed through the system.
The result is a faster elevator core (and faster IO schedulers), with a
nice net reduction of kernel text and code as well.
If you have time, please give this patch series a test spin just to
verify that everything still works for you. Thanks!
