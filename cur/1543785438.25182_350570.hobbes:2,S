Bharata, 
Ideally one should move the "nr_requested/nr_freed" counters from your
stats patch into "struct shrinker" (or somewhere else more appropriate
in which per-shrinkable-cache stats are maintained), and use the
"mod_page_state" infrastructure to do lockless per-CPU accounting. ie.
break /proc/vmstats's "slabs_scanned" apart in meaningful pieces.
IMO something along that line should be merged into mainline to walk
away from the "what the fuck is going on" state of things.
