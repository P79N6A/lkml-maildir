That's a plus, but I don't see it balances the minus.

The fact that you now have to shadow operations on vm_file by
operations on your exe_file, easy to get out of step; and that
we'll tend not to notice when it goes wrong, because the common
case will have them both in the root mount (that will hide busy
errors, won't it? or am I mistaken?).
Though I should concede that your latest patch looks like it catches
all the places it needs to, and that they don't really stretch beyond
mm/mmap.c.  If you provided functions to do the get_file/fput/VM_EXE-
CUTABLE stuff, most of the ugliness would be confined to fs/proc/base.c.
I much preferred Andrew's take-a-copy-of-the-pathname approach, but
admit I'm not one to appreciate the namespace arguments against it.
I wish I had a more constructive solution.

If you think it's going to help lots of others, please get them to
speak up in support.  But we're rather short of stacking filesystems
in the kernel at present, so it can be hard to argue.

Yes, but our different viewpoints give us a different idea of what's
a quirk.  The quirk I see is that MVFS is fiddling with vma->vm_file
in its ->mmap, which is rather unusual (though not unique); and then
complaining when this doesn't work as it wants.  But you see it as a
quirk that the VM_EXECUTABLE's vm_file gets used for /proc/pid/exe?

Yes, and I'm suggesting that if we change the behaviour to suit you,
we might be causing a regression in something else.  No evidence for
that, but it's a possibility (though probably not one I'd be arguing,
if I actually liked the patch involved).
When and if the VFS provides integrated support for stacking filesystems,
it would make sense to do something about this.  But as things stand, it's
for the stacking filesystem to manage its stack.  Why uglify the kernel
code (which doesn't include any user for this), instead of managing that
stacking yourself i.e. why not leave vm_file as is (or if necessary
point it to a proxy), and use its private_data for your optimizations?

But whose bug?
