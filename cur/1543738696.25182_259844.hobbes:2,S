Yes, I see that. But so far every bus implements it in its own way - USB,
IEEE1394, serio, pcmcia... It would be nice if there was a standard
mechanism to deal with that situation. And actually a standard way of
pruning part of the device tree which is useful for other things as well.

It really depends on the bus I think... I do not know USB well enough but
does status code gives you enough information to determine that the device
is gone or it's just not responding for mose reason? I probably would not
want to log errors when device is really gone, but when I fail to talk to
it becuase its stuck I would complain.
