I was more thinking of using the new INT 0x13 interface, which uses
32-bit values.  From Ralph Brown's interrupt list:
--------d-1348-------------------------------
INT 13 - IBM/MS INT 13 Extensions - GET DRIVE PARAMETERS
        AH = 48h
        DL = drive (80h-FFh)
        DS:SI -> buffer for drive parameters (see #00273)
Return: CF clear if successful
            AH = 00h
            DS:SI buffer filled
        CF set on error
            AH = error code (see #00234)
BUG:    several different Compaq BIOSes incorrectly report high-numbered
          drives (such as 90h, B0h, D0h, and F0h) as present, giving
them the
          same geometry as drive 80h; as a workaround, scan through disk
          numbers, stopping as soon as the number of valid drives
encountered
          equals the value in 0040h:0075h
SeeAlso: AH=08h,AH=41h,AH=49h,MEM 0040h:0075h
Format of IBM/MS INT 13 Extensions drive parameters:
Offset  Size    Description     (Table 00273)
 00h    WORD    (call) size of buffer
                    (001Ah for v1.x, 001Eh for v2.x, 42h for v3.0)
                (ret) size of returned data
 02h    WORD    information flags (see #00274)
 04h    DWORD   number of physical cylinders on drive
 08h    DWORD   number of physical heads on drive
 0Ch    DWORD   number of physical sectors per track
 10h    QWORD   total number of sectors on drive
 18h    WORD    bytes per sector

I don't think it uses INT 0x13.  There's a comment in the source
suggesting an implementation.

fdisk (and parted) use the HDIO_GETGEOMETRY ioctl.  However, Linux
isn't good at detecting the geometry, so the ioctl sometimes returns
the wrong geometry.
