Hello!
  I just found something that looks somewhat weird:
mordor:~$ /bin/nonexistent_binary
bash: ./nonexistent_binary: Permission denied
mordor:~$ nonexistent_binary
bash: nonexistent_binary: command not found
  Shouldn't first attempt also say "command not found"?
  BASH_VERSION='2.03.0(1)-release'
  I'm running 2.3.99-pre3
Bye,
    Oleg
