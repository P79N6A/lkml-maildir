Oleg,
Thanks for your comments. Shows how little I really understand the
workqueue API :)

Ah, cancel_work_sync() waits only for it if A is currently running?

Right. I was thinking of the flush_workqueue case where any of A or B
matters.

Yeah, and then we'll take both wq->lockdep_map and the
work_struct->lockdep_map when running that work. That should work, I'll
give it a go later.

I didn't really think about those yet, but I think you're right.

Not sure, Ingo?

No particular reason I think, I copied some other code doing it that
way.

Sure, that works. I thought about compiling out the argument completely
for the no-lockdep case, would you prefer that?

Actually, I found the bug by experiencing it and analysing the stack
traces; then I thought that it should be possible to add lockdep support
for that to avoid regressing :)
