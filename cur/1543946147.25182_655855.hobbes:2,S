Output of /proc/slabinfo, please. If you could get a sample when the
machine has just booted, one at the typical post-boot steady state
as well as one after it has increased well past normal, it would
help identify what type of inode is increasing differently.
Also, can you tell us what metrics you are graphing (i.e. where
in /proc or /sys you are getting them from)?
Cheers,
Dave.
