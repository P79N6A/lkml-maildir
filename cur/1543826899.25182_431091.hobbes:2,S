Read the serial console code. It is a standalone implementation
completely seperate from the standard drivers, which deliberately
turns off the interrupts and reverts to polling. This because
there is no guarantee the whole irq handling stuff still works
at the moment you're printk'ing a panic.
Also the current standard serial drivers only work if the
tty has been opened by a userspace process.
If you want to change this, first fix the latter problem, then
change the serial console output driver so that it uses the
standard serial driver for lower priority messages and only
uses the polling code for panics.
Mike.
