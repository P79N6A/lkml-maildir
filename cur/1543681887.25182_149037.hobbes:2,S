i've recently upgraded to 2.6.0-test on my machines. one of them has a sis 730 video card
built into the motherboard. as i recall, the 2.4.21 kernel allowed you to compile in DRM support for SiS 630/730 cards 
in the "Character Devices" section under DRM. i've checked DRI support with glxinfo in 2.4.21 and direct rendering is
enabled, while in 2.6 it is not. do the 2.6(and 2.5) kernels have support for DRM with the SiS 630/730 chipset? i know the config
has changed, is there anything i have to compile in so i can get DRI working with these cards? the framebuffer device, frambebuffer
console and agpgart are working fine.
