In general yes, the patch should be okay.  But there are a few things to
check for.  Perhaps most of the USB drivers don't care whether interrupts
are enabled or not in their completion routines.  However I know of at
least one where it does matter.  The current code _is_ SMP-safe, but it
won't remain UP-safe unless you add this patch in addition to your own.

P.S.: Another routine worth examining is async_completed() in 
drivers/usb/core/devio.c.
