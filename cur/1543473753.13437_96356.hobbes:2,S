I noticed some messages in my syslog like this:
Dec 31 04:07:31 scottm kernel: ad1848.c: Can't allocate DMA3
but everything still seemed to work last night when I was testing (see
below).

I sent a patch for this to Alan last night that makes the chipset detection
more forgiving towards Yamaha's apparent freedom with the version numbers.
Also included was a last resort option to make the driver ignore the version
number and act like either a SA2 or SA3/x.  As well, I did some cleanup on
the driver's mixer ioctl code, which was needed to get newer versions of
aumix to work.
Happy New Year!,
Scott
