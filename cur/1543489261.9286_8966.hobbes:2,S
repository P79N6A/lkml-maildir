It shouldn't unless you have turned off attribute caching. If this is
not the case, please try 'echo 9 >/proc/sys/sunrpc/nfs_debug' and send
me the syslogged output.

Looks like nobody has updated that for a while. Linux-2.2.x has both
read and write caching. The wsize is limited in stock linux-2.2.x to
the page size (4k on ix86 machines), but there are currently
experimental patches for exceeding this value.
