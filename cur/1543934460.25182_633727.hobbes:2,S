Right.  I'm not objecting to this at all.  Just pointing
out that usbcore will still end up including quite a lot
of hub functionality, because there's still going to be
a root hub in the system and a khubd managing it.
This patch might be improved slightly -- in ways that, as I
understand things, could save some RAM on Blackfin! -- by
having the BLACKLIST_HUB option get rid of the transaction
translator support (changing C code not just Kconfig).
It's pretty minimal, but won't be used...
Also, as you point out, it's no longer OTG specific, so
renaming the option would improve clarity.   Maybe to
something along the lines of USB_HOST_NO_EXTERNAL_HUBS.
No big deal, at least now.
