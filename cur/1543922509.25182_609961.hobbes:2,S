Oh crap.  I just realized this is an older version of the patch..mustv'e
forgot to refresh...grr.  Ill send out the refreshed one.
But anyway, I digress.

In the form presented here in this email, perhaps.  I think you will see
some significant improvements in the refreshed version.  The big change
is that the global lock is gone.

Don't forget:  The same is precisely true for the current -rt2
algorithm.  For instance, the -rt2 algorithm aside from being linear in
general, scales cacheline bouncing linearly as well.  Each cpu is going
to trash rq->rt.highest_prio and then we will walk them for each scan.
The fact is, you can't maintain a global dynamic policy without bouncing
cachelines, period.  But hopefully we can minimize it, and I just want
to see the fastest code here.

I still owe you timing data, but at this juncture I think I can beat
linear (especially as we start throwing in big-iron) ;)  I originally
got involved in this scheduler rework from observations of poor scaling
on our 8/16-ways, so I want it to scale as much as you ;)  If this alg
doesn't pan out, that's cool.  But I think it will in the end.  Linear
algs in the fast path just make my skin crawl.  Perhaps it will still be
the best design in the end, but I am not giving up that easy until I
prove it to myself.
