It is good, so long as the sound process runs at a higher-than-default 
priority.  Trying to get sound to run skiplessly at the same priority as a 
normal process is just a waste of time.  If it happens to work in some kernel 
versions or hardware configurations, it's an accident.
Though I've admittedly only done a small of testing, I haven't seen a glitch 
recently.  I'm a happy camper.  (Right now I'm running make -j25, apt-get 
installing OpenOffice and listening to Bolero.)
