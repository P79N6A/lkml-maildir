Hi,
I just tried an allyesconfig on 2.6.17-rc1 and this popped up:
security/selinux/xfrm.c: In function ‘selinux_socket_getpeer_dgram’:
security/selinux/xfrm.c:284: error: ‘struct sec_path’ has no member named 
‘x’
security/selinux/xfrm.c: In function ‘selinux_xfrm_sock_rcv_skb’:
security/selinux/xfrm.c:317: error: ‘struct sec_path’ has no member named 
‘x’
