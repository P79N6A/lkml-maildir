Keeping the files opened wouldn't avoid that race.
Only way to avoid that race is operationally -- don't touch the part of
the system where cpio (or tar, cp, etc.) is playing.
But this operational procedure doesn't solve silliness like fstat
returning same inode for different files on some file systems.
[Not that there is a good solution...  on the third hand, I think that
cpio, etc. should be taught to not trust inode numbers being the same
if file size and/or timestamp differ.  Which maybe is what you were
getting at.]
