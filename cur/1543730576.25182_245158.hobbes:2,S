Yep. You are right. I just had some old testing program that I used with
2.4.21 and there I wanted to make sure that things work in pthread. So I
just reused it without removing pthread stuff.
This "small rounding error" crashes my application pretty nice. Because
my application assumes that when I call setitimer second time, then the
timer will be either the same or smaller, not bigger. And definetely no
man page mentions this sudden growth. Quite opposit, man page says that
the value is decremented.
At least now I know that it's reproduceble on other machines.
