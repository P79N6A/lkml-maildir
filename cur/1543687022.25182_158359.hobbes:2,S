Even a good sysadmin cannot guarantee the MAC address is unique, IP
addresses are often duplicates (e.g. 192.168.1.x) unless you know they
aren't), and the machine name is likely to conflict with someone
else's in the world, but these are all good inputs to include.

Not just malicious sysadmins, but accidental conflicts due to
e.g. trusting your MAC address to be unique in the world, too.
