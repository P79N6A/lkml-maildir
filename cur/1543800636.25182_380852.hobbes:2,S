would it make sense to have the RCU subsystems with a threshold so that 
when more then X items are outstanding they trigger a premption of all 
other CPU's ASAP (forceing the scheduling break needed to make progress on 
clearing RCU)? This wouldn't work in all cases, but it could significantly 
reduce the problem situations.
