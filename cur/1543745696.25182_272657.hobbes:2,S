I can describe the "infrastructure" here, but there needs to be some
smallish coding work in order to get this working and I don't really
have much time to do that myself.  The basic premise is that for ext3
filesystems formatted with large on-disk inodes we have reserved the first
word in the extra space to describe the "extra size" of the fixed fields
in struct ext3_inode stored in each inode on disk.  This allows us to
add permanent fields to the end of struct ext3_inode, and any remaining
space is used for the fast EAs before falling back to an external block.
This space was always intended to store extra timestamp fields ala:
struct ext3_inode {
	:
	:
	} osd2;
	__u16	i_extra_isize;
	__u16	i_pad1;
	__u32	i_ctime_hilow;	/* do we need nsecond atimes? */
	__u32	i_mtime_hilow;
	__u32	i_crtime;
	__u32	i_crtime_hilow;
};
Since the i_[mac]time fields are in seconds, I would like to store:
_hilow = nseconds >> 6 | (([mac]time64 >> 32) << 26)
[mac]time64 = [mac]time | (__u64)((_hilow & 0xfc000000) << 6);
nseconds = _hilow << 6;
so we get about 60ns resolution but also increase our dynamic range
by a factor of 64 (year 8704 problem here we come ;-).  Since crtime
is new we _could_ store it in the 100ns 64-bit format that NT uses.
Consistency is good on the one hand and we only need to do shift and OR,
while with straight 100ns times we also get a 6x larger dynamic range
(y58000) but also have to do a 64-bit divide by 10^7 for each access.
As we read an inode from disk we check i_extra_isize to determine
which fields, if any, are valid and when writing the inode we fill in
the fields and update i_extra_isize (taking care to push any existing
EAs out a bit, though that should be a rare case).  This avoids the EA
speed/size overhead to parse/read/write these fields, and allows us to
add new "fixed" fields into the large inode as necessary.
We don't touch any fields that we don't understand (normal ext3 compat
flags will tell us if there are incompatible features there).
So, in summary, the "i_extra_isize" handling is already there for inodes
(currently always set to '4') but we don't do anything with that space
yet.

Hmm, seems kind of counter-productive to allow a crtime that is settable...

By all means go for it ;-).  I'm not particularly fond of the proposed
pseudo-EA interface.  You are probably more likely than anyone to get
support for it.

It's CONFIG_FS_MBCACHE and/or CONFIG_EXT[23]_FS_XATTR_SHARING in the
original 2.4 xattr patches, not sure if they've disappeared in 2.6 kernels.
Hmm, seems that the CONFIG_FS_MBCACHE option doesn't allow you to turn it
off completely, which is a shame since both are completely useless for any
EAs which are different for each inode and just introduce overhead.  The
CONFIG_EXT[23]_FS_XATTR_SHARING options don't exist at all anymore.
Cheers, Andreas
