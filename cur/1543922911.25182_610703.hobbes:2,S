Well, it's an extension for sure, but a backward compatible one.  It
should not affect any correct existing application--i.e., one that
checks it's return status--except maybe the odd test program that needs
to be updated to handle the new semantics.  We're allowed to extend APIs
as long as we don't break correct applications, right?
I mean, it's not like it's a new argument or such.
