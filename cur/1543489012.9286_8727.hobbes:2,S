Subject: 2.2.3 pre-3 + DHCP 2.0b1pl11 not working

ok
2.2.1 plus the dhclient software from DHCP 2.0b1-patchlevel11
works just fine.
2.2.2 would not compile for me because of the config_socket issue.
2.2.3-pre3 compiles fine but the dhclient program will no longer work
properly.  I don't know what changed in between.  
I can give more info if anyone is interested or might know what
broke/changed.
