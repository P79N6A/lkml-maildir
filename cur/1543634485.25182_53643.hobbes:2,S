OK, understood.  I just see an opportunity to save memory and would love
to take advantage of it.  We should definitely look into giving pthreads
(maybe via NGPT) the ability to specify CLONE_CRED.  I suspect 90% of
the cases retain the same credentials anyhow.  Copy-on-write? :)

I am not so much worried about the ref counting (I think it looks right)
but just the general behavior.  I.e., you do not need to code anything
but you need to lay out right now what the locking rules need to be or
it will be a mess.
There is going to be code reading and writing p->cred data now
simultaneously and that should probably always be done under lock.
Another example: see fs/open.c :: sys_access().  I added that FIXME
there a couple kernel revisions ago...

Oh, OK - I thought you hated my syscalls :)
There is a patch in Linus's BK for it, or you can define cpu_online_map
to 1 on UP.
