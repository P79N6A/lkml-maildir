Correct me if  I'm wrong, but the fat driver seems to both require and
not accept the codepage mount option:
Aug  1 20:17:28 stretch FAT: Unrecognized mount option
"codepage=cp850" or missing value
..and when I remove it:
Aug  1 20:17:45 stretch FAT: codepage or iocharset option didn't specified
Aug  1 20:17:45 stretch File name can not access proper (mounted as read-only)
Since my fat partition is my major inter-OS storage other than my
server, this is highly annoying.
The relevant fstab line is:
/dev/hda4		/mnt/big	vfat		iocharset=cp850,fmask=0111,codepage=cp850		0 0
(I'm not sure what are good options for both, I was filling utf and
whatnot just to see it that'd help)
