Thanks for your comments.
trfs is just a framework for creating views. Translators are independent
entities, so the use of trfs will be more dependent on what translators
are present. Since translators are independent of each other, 
they can be used for hi-performance as well as low-performance things.
Translators need not be inside the trfs module (right now raw translator
is because the interface for translators isn't fixed yet). The raw
translator is dependent on block devices. A translator for some other
thing say a tar-directory translation could be dependent on a userfs.
e.g.
/trfs/tar/foo->/home/username/foo.tar
tar translator uses uservfs to create a view
It will use /uservfs/<something>/foo.tar#<bar>
