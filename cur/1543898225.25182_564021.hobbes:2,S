Except s3 and s9 aren't complete cookies.  A complete label might be:  
"system_u:system_r:apache2_t:s3" for an unclassified apache web- 
server process, or "kmoffett_u:secadmin_r:usershell_t:s9" for me  
logged in with a top-secret label in my security-administrator role.   
That's why you'd need to call an LSM hook to get a unique identifier,  
as the LSM would actually need to allocate identifiers for  
equivalence classes.  Secondly, processes may change labels as they  
run, so you couldn't just call it once and cache the result, you  
would need to call it for every freed page (or every re-use of a page).

I do think a single unsigned long cookie would work, as long as you  
have an LSM hook:
int process_equivalence_class(struct task_struct *task, unsigned long  
*result);
If it returns 0 then you can use the result as a page cookie,  
otherwise you can't reuse pages for this process at all.
