But there's another kind of freedom which Linux gives you which I
think you're forgetting about; unlike other operating systems which
tie you to a specific environment, Linux makes no assumptions about
your operating environment.  Person A might well be using a mostly GNU
environment, which Person B might be using a mostly BSD environment
with his Linux kernel.  Person C might be using a mix of GNU, BSD and
home-written software.  There's no way to know.  That's what's so
wonderful about Linux.
I think this kind of freedom is very valuable, and it is this freedom
which I am emphasizing when I say I use _Linux_, not GNU/Linux.
Linux: the freedom to be truly unique.
