The corruption you are talking about is, I believe, caused by a couple of things:
(1) we're not issuing enough fifo_wait()'s around our accel engine
    and pan register writes.
(2) there's some disconnect between writing to fb memory, panning, and
    copyarea()/fillrect() calls
I sent a hack of a fix for this to Ben a week ago, adding a call to radeonfb_sync()
at the end of radeonfb_copyarea() and radeonfb_fillrect().  This seems to fix the
problem for me, but you *shouldn't* have to do this.  
I haven't tracked it any further than this.  My next guess would be auditing register 
writes and making sure there are enough fifo_wait()'s...
