Sure.  But that isn't the point.  The point is that even if the
drive is capable and the chipset is capable, there still seem to
be corner cases where DMA is not enabled.
In my case, the chipset and drives in my box are both known to
work with DMA enabled and the ide chipset is even in the IDEDMA
white list.  But DMA is still not being enabled by default, so
there is a bug somewhere,
So why don't I want to hard code hdparm in an init script?  Lets
suppose for a moment there are programs that need to run on all
sorts of strange hardware and which depend on trying to run the
hard drives as fast as possible.  For example, think of the
installer for your favorite distro.  Redhat or Debian or whatever
couldn't very well put 'hdparm -d1 /dev/hda' in the init scipts
since for all they know there might be a cmd640 under the hood...
