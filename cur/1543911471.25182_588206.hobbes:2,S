I suspect that this is not sufficient.  The application should
be prepared to rewrite data if it can determine what data did
not get written.  Using fsync will tell the application when
data was not written to the server correctly, but not which
part of the data.
Perhaps O_SYNC or fsync following each write, but either one of
these options will also cause a large performance degradation.
The right solution is the use of TCP and hard mounting.
