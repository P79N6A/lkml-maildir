Currently there are only system timer and debug serial unit registered on
irq line 1.
Debug serial unit is used as the console !

What shares it?
Reason I ask, is that this irq is now running in true interrupt context,
and that on PREEMPT_RT the spin_locks are mutexes and can schedule. So
if another device is sharing this irq, then its interrupt handler will
be running in interrupt context, and if it grabs a spin_lock than is not
a raw_spinlock_t then you will have a crash.
This won't be a problem if you only turn on Hard irqs as threads and
don't do the PREEMPT_RT.
