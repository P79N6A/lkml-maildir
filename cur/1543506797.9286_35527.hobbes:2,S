Have you tried the demand dialing option?  When we were required to move
to pppd 2.3.5 during the 2.1 development cycle, that option started
working for me.  I've since went with a cable modem so I can't test
whether it still works.  It required some changes to the
/etc/ppp/options file which looked like thus:
[root@wr5z ppp]# cat options
demand \
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx \
idle 300 \
ipcp-accept-local \
ipcp-accept-remote \
defaultroute
