 hmmm ... interesting ... maybe it has to do with the errata 11 bug ...

hmmm .. .someone said it before: you could do this with the setpci
command. i tested it this morning:
kt133/133a and kx133:
enable: setpci -v -H1 -s 0:0.0 52=EB
disable: setpci -v -H1 -s 0:0.0 52=6B
kt266/266a:
enable: setpci -v -H1 -s 0:0.0 92=EB
disable: setpci -v -H1 -s 0:0.0 92=6B
remember: this is without my patch ... if my patch is compiled in and
active, the first "enable" is allready done at startup :)
