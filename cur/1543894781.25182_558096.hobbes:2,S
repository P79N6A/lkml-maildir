Yep. And §2 talks explicitly about independent and separate works when
they are distributed _with_ the Program, as part of a larger work based
on the Program.

The differences are subtle, but they do exist. They're not really about
whether it's iso9660 or cramfs; it's about whether what you put on them
is a coherent work in its own right or just a bunch of bits which happen
to be thrown together onto the same medium.
And in the router case, there's little point to its existence without
the binary-only module. At least with the DVD it _can_ work without the
binary-only module. Although as I said, some distributors definitely
claim that the distribution is a 'coherent whole' too.

It's a grey area, and nobody's 'right' until/unless a court decides. And
then only until/unless a higher court contradicts it. The reason I
jumped in was to point out that it isn't _just_ about whether the module
is a derived work or not. The GPL goes further than that.
