Right now if an all powerful person calls a script that script is all
powerful also. That is probably going to last for some time.
I have that configurable via SECURE_STRICT_FX .
Presently setting the "strict fx" securebit would render your machine
quite unusable. none of your shell scripts would have any caps whatsoever
and you depend on shell scripts a lot.
I also would advocate that shell builtins should be sufficient for
dropping and controling of caps in shell scripts.

Any caps I mention are *derived* from a withdrawn draft posix document.
