Not that much, been there done that, it's actually quite simple :)

How do you protect against change of your "next" pointer ? by taking a
global lock, peeking at it, getting it, unlocking ? That would work in
that case I suppose ...

A fine grained lock used when adding/removing items and when "peeking"
at next might work there..

It's just making the race less likely to happen, but it's still there.
Once the object you are peeking (or your next object, whatever) is
unhooked from the list, that means that the next point it contains is
crap. At any  time while you are playing with it, somebody may free the
"next" object, and since you are unhooked form the list, your own "next"
pointer will not be updated -> kaboom.
