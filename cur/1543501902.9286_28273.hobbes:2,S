Yes, it can also be the drives fault! I once owned a CD-ROM
drive, which was able to put every IDE-CD driver (tried Linux
2.0.33, OS/2 Warp, Win95, PC-DOS with MSCDEX-Interface) into a
locked state. It spinned up and down and I couldn't eject, too.
But it also didn't serve any data.
Under Warp:    Process accessing drive hung, others slowed down a
               bit
Under Win95:   Machine hang
Under Linux 2.0.33: Processes acessing drive hung, others in
               normal operation (even the ones accessing the
               master device of this drive)
Other behavior, was same you described. I think it was a
BTXXXXX-Drive (can't remember that crap).
