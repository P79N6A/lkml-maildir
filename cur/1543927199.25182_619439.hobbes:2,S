There was, at some point, discussion about using the gcc TLS mechanism, 
which should permit even better code to be generated.  Unfortunately, it 
would require gcc to be able to reference %gs instead of %fs (and vice 
versa for i386), which I don't think is available in anything except 
maybe the most cutting-edge version of gcc.
However, if we're doing a masssive revampt it would be good to get an 
idea of how to migrate to that model eventually, or why it doesn't make 
sense at all.
