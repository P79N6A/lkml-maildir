Ok, I switched to a Seagate ST34520N (7200 rpm, scsi2 narrow, 4.5 GB),
and I added a new test: Linux-multi-thread vs Linux-multi-process. The
results are as I expected:
-Linux-multi-process is more or less on par with NT. The 20% difference
could be the thread/process overhead.
-Linux-multi-thread is sloww.
450000 pages test file, ext2 and NTFS, 128 MB ram, Sym810 controller,
AMD K6/200
