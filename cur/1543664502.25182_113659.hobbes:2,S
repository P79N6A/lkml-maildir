Well, I'd have to say that I feel a little squeemish about being
called the maintainer of the kernel code because I don't feel I can
devote the time to it that it needs.  If someone else is willing to
step up I'd happily cede the job to them.

I have not looked at the most recent 2.5.* kernels but if that is true
then you're right, it is ill conceived.

Which raises an issue I've been wondering about, how to tell when a
kernel is being built for a system with ISA bus capabilities.  The
current code checks CONFIG_ISA but that's probably a bad idea.

This sounds fine to me.  I'd be concerned about giving up ISA
interrupts completely, that some of the less used drivers have never
been tested for compatibility with shared interrupts.
