Anyhow, I recall reading an article about 'unified name spaces', and I'm 
not referring to what's on namesys.com.  It mentioned how putting device 
nodes into the file system is a very powerful innovation of UNIX. 
Having files and devices in the same name space simplifies tools and 
makes the environment much more powerful, because you can connect data 
sources and targets together more arbitarily.
If I recall correctly, the article mentioned something about Plan9 
taking things to a greater extreme than UNIX.
Going along with what you said, Jamie, if "containers" like tar files 
could be accessed like directories without being first extracted, it 
would increase the power and flexibility of the whole system.  Windows 
XP does something like this with the way it presents ZIP files as 
directories, and although I'm sure the Windows way isn't nearly as 
efficient and universal as how Linux would do it, I find the feature to 
be INCREDIBLY useful.
Of course, we don't necessarily want codecs for every archive format 
ever invented to be embedded in the kernel.  Instead, we need to do 
something like how you can mount an ISO on a loopback device, only more 
transparently and more flexibly, and with the less performance-critical 
codecs being implemented as daemons in userspace.
Also, there would be limitations.  For instance, many such 
pseudo-directories would be read-only, and some would be writable only 
when on some file systems (like writing to a compressed archive might be 
much easier to implement on Reiser4 than something else, or perhaps the 
ext3 version would have to do a lot more copying, while the Reiser 
version could take advantage of Reiser-specific features like inserting 
in the middle of a file).
