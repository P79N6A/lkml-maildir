I don't think it's recursing -- I think the stack trace is just a bit
noisy. The problem is that the bridge code, especially with br_netfilter
in the equation, is implicated in code paths which are just _too_ deep.
This happens when you're bridging packets received in an interrupt while
you were deep in journalling code, and it's also been seen with a call
trace something like nfs->sunrpc->ip->bridge->br_netfilter.
One option might be to make br_dev_xmit() just queue the packet rather
than trying to deliver it to all the slave devices immediately. Then the
actual retransmission can be handled from a context where we're _not_
short of stack; perhaps from a dedicated kernel thread. 
Unfortunately that approach would introduce a lot of latency on all
packets we pass. Another option would be to have all architectures
provide a stack_available() function and for br_dev_xmit() to queue the
packet only if we're short of stack, while still sending most packets
immediately. 
Proof of concept below; obviously the stack_available() is an evil hack
and would need to be done more sanely. Comments?
