Thanks. Just ask hpa for a kernel.org dir, if you don't have anywhere
else to keep it.

Of course not, discovering the missing locking is most of the work. And
of course acknowedging that there's a problem :-)

I did that once a long time ago, but it was very broken because the IDE
code would end up in ide_do_request() several times at times before a
request was started. I think there are advantages both ways: leaving the
request on the queue until it is done allows the i/o scheduler to know
what the disk is currently working on. Removing it is potentially a bit
cleaner, however most of the reason for that has long been reworked in
2.5 (the plugging and head active stuff).
