".subsection" does not create jump instructions.  The linker does not
create jump instructions.  The only jump instructions are the ones
written in the source code.
The above code will execute three instructions in the do_default case:
"cmpl", "jbe" and "call".  No jumps are taken in that case.
The code does exactly what you said is logically impossible: one of
the cases, presumably marked "likely" in C code, takes no jumps at
all.  What the other cases do is irrelevant.  That is called
optimising for the likely case, at the expense of the others.
Try assembling the above source, with a "ret" after it, and then
disassemble the object file, if you don't believe me.
Or just read Pavel's example.
If you don't understand Pavel's example, there is no hope of you
grokking the advanced stuff ;)
Seriously, you can't possibly have done asm programming for 30
years without optimising for fast paths... surely?

You'll be glad to know GCC does it without linker tricks.

It shouldn't.  That would misalign the RSB (return stack buffer:
target prediction for "ret") causing several subsequent "ret"
instructions to mispredict their targets and stall the pipeline.
