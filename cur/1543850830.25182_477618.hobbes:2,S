Hierarchy has implications in not just the kernel-user API, but also on
the controller design. I would prefer to progressively enhance the
controller, not supporting hierarchy in the begining.
However you do have a valid concern that, if we dont design the user-kernel 
API keeping hierarchy in mind, then we may break this interface when we 
latter add hierarchy support, which will be bad. 
One possibility is to design the user-kernel interface that supports hierarchy
but not support creating hierarchical depths more than 1 in the initial 
versions. Would that work?
