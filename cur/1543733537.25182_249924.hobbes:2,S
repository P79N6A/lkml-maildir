Why do you need to edit top-level Makefile?
Amyways I try to avoid these, but my gvim is pretty consistent in adding
additional tabs/spaces here and there. Anyone that can tell me how to
teach gvim not to do so (and flag trailing tabs/spaces).
I have included below fix in patch that fixes '-j1' warning.
