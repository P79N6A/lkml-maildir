IIUC, you mean a command line option which is parsed by boot-loader and
then boot-loader loads the kernel at user specified address?
I think it might not be a very good idea as hibernation becomes boot-loader
dependent scheme. How many boot-loaders will one modify and hibernation
will not work with older versions of boot-loader. 
I think it is better to make kernel relocate to user specified address and
keep hibernation mechanism independent of specific boot-loader(grup, lilo,...)
and boot-loader version.
