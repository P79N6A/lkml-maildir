First of all, this is not a Slackware Problem. Maybe you forgot to enable some
option? Maybe "Prompt for development and/or incomplete drivers" ?
There might also be a problem with the kernel slackware <4.0 Ships. It it 2.0.x.
e.g. 3.3 ships with 2.0.30.
Try to upgrade your system as soon as possible - this fixes bugs, especially in
the smp-stuff.
