Ok,
After spending (too much) time to bisect this, I found that the looser
commit is:
c31c7d4844ea4817692ae16bf70f9c96c05a50eb
[ x86: CPA, fix alias checks ]
nvidiafb module issue seems just a consequence of this commit.
What's look suspect from the dmesg is this:
PCI: Cannot map mmconfig aperture for segment 0
Any idea what is broken on my laptop ?
BTW, I couldn't revert this commit without conflicts so I gave a test to
c31c7d4844ea4817692ae16bf70f9c96c05a50eb parents. nvidiafb could
be loaded but the system locks during gnome session start...
Thanks
