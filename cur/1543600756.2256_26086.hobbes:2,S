;-)  Really, wasn't trying for that.  If we just say later calls for the
same offset, we get in trouble later on if we also want variable, very
large blocksizes.  If we relax the rules to allow multiple buffer heads for
the same physical spot on disk, things get easier, and the FS is
responsible for not doing something stupid with it.  
The data is still consistent either way, there are just multiple io handles.
