I implemented this in my kdb tree, but it has a very nasty side effect,
it stops you from debugging that part of the boot process between kdb
startup and when the i8042 is probed.  KDB starts up very early so we
can debug the boot process.  Not being able to use the PC keyboard
until later in boot is not acceptable.  People using USB keyboards
already suffer from this problem and it is very frustrating.
Adding a "kdb_use_keyboard" flag means all existing systems have to
change if they want a debugger during boot, just to workaround a few
systems that get an error when reading from non-existent legacy I/O
ports.  So I am going back to my original idea, add 'kdb_skip_keyboard'
which is only required on the problem machines.
