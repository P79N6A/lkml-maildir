pci_name_device() (at least in 2.3.99-pre2) overwrites innocent data in struct
pci_dev if the sum of the lengths of the vendor and device names are longer
than 47 characters. Examples are:
    Digital Equipment Corporation DECchip 21140 [FasterNet]
    Digital Equipment Corporation DECchip 21140 [FasterNet] (#2)
    Acer Laboratories Inc. [ALi] M1533 PCI to ISA Bridge [Aladdin IV]
Unfortunately the kernel doesn't have snprintf() yet, and updating vsprintf()
for bounds looks quite clumsy. Using strncpy() and strncat() is possible here
but would be rather complex for the case where only the vendor ID is
recognized.

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
