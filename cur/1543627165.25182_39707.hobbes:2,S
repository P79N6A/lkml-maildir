Yes,
The current interface is  
(A) 
async wait:
	sys_futex (uaddr, FUTEX_AWAIT, value, (struct timespec*) sig);
upon signal handling
	sys_futex(uaddrs[], FUTEX_WAIT, size, NULL);
	to retrieve the uaddrs that got woken up...
If you simply want a notification with SIGIO (or whatever you desire)
We can change that to 
(A) 
sys_futex(uaddr, FUTEX_WAIT, value, (truct timespec*) fd);
I send a SIGIO and you can request via ioctl or read the pending 
notifications from fd. 
(B)        { struct futex *notarray[N]
              int n = read( futex_fd, (void**)notarray, 
	                    N*sizeof(struct futex));
	}
I am mainly concerned that SIGIO can be overloaded in a thread package ?
How would you know whether a SIGIO came from the futex or from other file 
handle.
That is your call to make. Let me know !!!
