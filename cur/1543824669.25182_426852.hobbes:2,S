	An additional note: I use "iommu=off" boot option (I had some
problems using IOMMU in the past, so I have disabled it). Without
this option, 2.6.16.18 boots correctly (I have not stress-tested the
system yet, so I don't know whether the IOMMU problems are solved).
But nevertheless, it would be nice to have 3ware driver working
even with iommu=off.
