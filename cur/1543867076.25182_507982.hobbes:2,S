We're talking about _both_ the STR and STD.  The drivers that have problems
with the STR cannot be regarded as suspend/resume-safe IMO.

Please take the STR into consideration too.  After all we use the same
suspend/resume code for both STD and STR so it should work with both.  If it
doesn't work with one of them, we have a problem.

I'm still thinking that would be wasteful.  I think there are more drivers that
work than there are drivers that don't work.

Actually, the lack of documentation is a major problem that we all should
try to fix in the first place.  Unfortunately the code has been recently
changing quite often, so that's difficult.
