No, this is not the way to submit major rewrite of swap subsystem.
You need to (at minimum, making fundamental changes _is_ hard):
1) Fix your mailer not to wordwrap.
2) Get some testing. Identify workloads it improves.
3) Get some _external_ testing. You are retransmitting wordwrapped
patch. That means noone other then you is actually using it.
4) Don't cc me; I'm not mm expert, and I tend to read l-k, anyway.

I am not sure GFDL is GPL compatible.

I thought I told you to read the CodingStyle in some previous mail?
