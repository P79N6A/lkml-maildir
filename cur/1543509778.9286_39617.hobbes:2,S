Here is an idea for generating i_generation numbers:
  most of the generation number will be a counter that is
  incremented when an inode is allocated.  However; the bottom
  5 bits will be seeded with a random number from net_random.
  An attacker will still be able to make a filehandle with this
  scheme, there is a 31 in 32 chance that they will not pick the
  correct lower 5 bits.  However if the upper bits are correct
  and the lower bits are not correct then, most likely, an attack
  is in progress.
  Five bits is just a guess.  You want there to be a good chance
  that attacks will be seen, but you don't want the counter to
  roll over to soon.  Five bits gives you 150 million files
  before the generation number wraps and also gives a 96% chance
  that an attack will be logged.  Six bits is 67 million files
  and a 98% chance of seeing an attack.
  The code is as follows:
	inode->i_generation += 0x20;
	inode->i_generation ^= net_random() & 0x1F;
  Please send comments.
