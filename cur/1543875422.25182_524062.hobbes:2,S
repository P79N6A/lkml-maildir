You still don't need this. Ancient versions of gcc had problems with the
attribute, but it's not even possible to build the kernel with those
anymore. Please remove these and try again. You can simply alias
SMP_CACHE_BYTES to L1_CACHE_BYTES if you've left this in due to the
resulting build failure.
m68knommu seems to be another user that never got cleaned up, perhaps
it's a good time to kill that off too..
