Hi,
with updating to 2.6.10-rc3 i decided to test vesafb.
I added vga=0x318 to lilo.conf. (lilo version 22.6)
On reboot I see a message "..undefined mode number..."
The kernel asks me, to type the mode id, i would like to use.
mode id 315 is working, but 316, 317, 318, ... are not working.
I'm using a nvidia geforce 440mx card.
any ideas?
btw, rivafb does not work for me, too. it just gives me a black screen.
thanks, sebastian
