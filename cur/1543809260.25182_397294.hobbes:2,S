 (1) devices have pretty clear ownership.  Implementing ioctls in
     different modules means we get a very undefined API.  Given that
     ioctls are generally deprecated adding extensions to that is
     a bad idea.
 (2) cleaning up that mess reduced code size a lot
 (3) the cmb module had more glue code than actual ioctl implementation
     which speaks words at length.
 (4) adding new ioctls is not okay in general, you should be using
     better APIs.
 (5) you're not just adding new ioctls but also add them using the
     dynamic registration facility that I NACKed before and remove in
     earlier sent patches, but you copletly ignored all objections
     and just resent the patches anyway
 (6) in addition to the dynamic ioctls it's also adding a misc device,
     leading to a totally incoherent interface.

It's not code that doesn't fit mu ideas but code that was rushed in
despite my veto for good reasons.

that's totally fine with me.  As long as we backout the bogus eer
patch before 2.6.16 all the cleanups and even the eckd ioctl fix
can wait.  But don't put this crappy interface into 1.6.16 and thus
SLES10 so that applications start to rely on it.
