In this instance there's nothing in distributed userspace code relying on the
actual version numbers yet, so it's OK to swap them over if the ioctl patches
are held back:
  dm-prevent-removal-if-open.patch then sets #define DM_VERSION_MINOR 7
  dm-support-ioctls-on-mapped-devices.patch then sets #define DM_VERSION_MINOR 8
(The date in DM_VERSION_EXTRA is for information only - can either leave alone
or set to today's date when edited.)
