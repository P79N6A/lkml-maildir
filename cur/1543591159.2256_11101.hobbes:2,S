Well, they traditionally start with 1, not 0, too. Or have cute 
little icons and no text. Or aren't labelled at all. I'm using one 
fairly well-known dual-port PCI serial board that silently 
interchanged the two ports on a rev change, with no labelling change 
at all ('cause there was no label!). Make your ttySx match *that*!
