[snip the long debug output, see original MSG]
I forgot to mention that with 2.6.6 this same hardware and mostly the same .config was working steadily for quite a long time.
If .config is relevant will post it or send it on request.
I looked at `diff -Nru linux-2.6.{6,7}/drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/`, but is really big :-(
Looking closely at the log MSG, it is basicly:
