Well, it can be used as a guide for where things have to be patched.
It's not really suited to creating devfs directories which can be used
by random CPU drivers, since you're using an initcall.
However, the per-CPU structures you seem to be creating appears to be
a logical place to add a devfs entry. As part of the CPU detection
process, that entry should be initialised. Then drivers can simply
reference that entry.
