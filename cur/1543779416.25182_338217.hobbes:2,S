Yes you are right it is a 4-port sata-II 300 card (PDC40718 ). According to
the promise feature list it should support :
SATA300™ TX4 Highlights
   * Native Command Queuing (NCQ)
   * SATA Tagged Command Queuing (TCQ)
   * Large LBA support for drives above 137GB
   * Supports Serial ATAPI devices
   * Disk Activity LED Headers
   * Flexible future-proof upgrade for users with motherboards that
     only have a PCI interface
My question is also are these features (NCQ/TCQ) and the heigher 
datarate be supported by this
modification? or is only the basic feature set of sata 150 TX4 supported?
Here is the patch:

I just saw the patches of  Luke Kosewski regarding the SATA150 TX4 antipating
them it might be right to modify the patch to
