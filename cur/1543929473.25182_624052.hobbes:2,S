thanks, the patches look certainly sane and i've picked them up into 
x86.git. A quick build & boot test was successful on both 64-bit and 
32-bit, with paravirt on/off. I've pushed out the latest tree into the 
'mm' branch of:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-x86.git
minor nit: some of your patches had scripts/checkpatch.pl failures, 
could you try to fix them up? (If possible then as a follow-up second 
patch series.) Thanks!
[ btw., how far away are you from having Kconfig selectable 64-bit
  paravirt support? Just curious :-) ]
