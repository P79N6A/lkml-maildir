Not that I'm qualified to comment about the architecture at all.
But it sounds like it is an improvement over what is currently in
there. Seeing as you're listed as ARM26 maintainer, and the patch
being completely contained to arm26, I'm sure you could get it
included quite easily ;)
The patch isn't _that_ big, but if you broke it up into a series, and
posted them (inline) to lkml, I'm sure Andrew Morton would queue them
up for after 2.6.10 for you (make sure he sees them).
Or alternatively, if it is accompanied by a quite detailed changelog,
often these sort of updates can be taken in as a single patch.
Good luck!
Nick
