Hi -- yes, it is looking to compile the firmware into the kernel so
that during boot it can access it in-memory.  Despite showing it's age
as a driver, unfortunately we still probably cannot just include the
firmware for obvious reasons.  I actually have an update for this
driver that I need to get around to patching up, so this kind of
reminded me.
thanks
Andrew
