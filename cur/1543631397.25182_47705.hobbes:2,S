Bigger readahead helps dbench too.
Readahead in 2.5.x and dbench and tiobench sequential read 
average throughput on my uniproc ide box was roughly:
kernel          readahead        dbench         tiobench
2.5.0 - 2.5.7       8            8.1 mb/s       9.9 mb/s
2.5.8 - 2.5.10      0            3.5 mb/s       9.9 mb/s
2.5.11 - 2.5.17   256           13   mb/s      10.2 mb/s
2.5.8-akpm       1024           22   mb/s      18.1 mb/s
Bigger readahead appears to lower tiobench sequential read 
latency a little.
2.4.x showed readahead = 8 for 2.4.3 - 2.4.19-pre8, including
aa, ac, jam, mjc, and rmap.
