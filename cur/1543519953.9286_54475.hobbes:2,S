You mean have the original program non-setuid? Either way, fork()
is going to get exactly the same capabilities as the parent, so
I don't see how this is going to help.

Would work, if programs could change other programs' capabilities,
which they can't, without a kernel patch (which I was trying to
avoid). CAP_SETPCAP is disabled for everyone from init down.

Only 4? I was under the impression there were 16 left (though this
is 2.2. Maybe more are used in 2.3.
Do you have a better solution? I think its silly to expect every
program to be made capabilities aware when a few simple changes
will make you at least be able to run a mixed setup safely.
