Ok, then we are on the same line. It indeed makes sense to do this
with watchdog devices that are capable of being controlled by the
bios and where the timeout/keepalive time can be set big enough.
What should also be looked at is when you take over the watchdog
settings from the bios, do you then take the same timeout/keepalive
value? In the pcwd-drivers I took the dip-switch value of the card
when the value was 0. You could do something similar here.
Greetings,
Wim.
