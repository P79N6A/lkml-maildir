I'm not sure whether you are commenting on my patch 
(pci-quirk_via_irq-behaviour-change.patch), or Sergio's, but just to 
clarify:
My patch includes a hack that detects the presence of a VIA southbridge, 
and only applies quirks if a southbridge is present.
This isn't perfect, as someone could insert a VIA PCI card into a 
VIA-based motherboard and the PCI card would get quirked, but it's the 
most accurate solution which has been proposed so far.
If the southbridge detection hack is acceptable, there is no reason why 
it could not be combined with Sergio's patch.
