I am not sure, but I though nVidia cards were different. I have used a tnt2 
before I had my radeon (I used it with that previous motherboard) and back 
then, I have been advised to compile kernels without AGP support since the 
nVidia drivers wouldn't use them anyway (despite the fact that it was a 4x 
agp card). NVidia seems to have his own method of accessing the agp bus.
