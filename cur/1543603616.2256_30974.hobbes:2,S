Even so I can't see a need to have this resolution for mtime, and as you 
pointed
out there can still be races on SMP systems and timing resolutions are 
system
dependent anyway.

if (file->mtime != mtime || file->gen_count != gen_count)
     file_changed=1;

No need as long as it doesn't wrap within the mtime resolution (1 second).

Sorry, by more complex I meant more instructions/CPU expensive.
