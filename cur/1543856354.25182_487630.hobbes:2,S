Hi Alan.
Thanks for your reply. I've read this thread already some weeks ago....
but from my limited knowledge I understood, that this was an issue
related to a SCSI adapter or so. Or did I understand this wrong. And as
soon as he removed the card everything was fine.
I don't have any PCI SCSI cards,... (but I have an onboard LSI53C1030
controller).
The only cards I have are:
PCIe bus (two slots):
Asus Nividia 7800GTX based card
PCI bus: no card (one slot):
no card
PCI-X bus A (100MHz) (two slots):
Hauppauge Nova T 500 Dual DVB-T card (which is actually a "normal" PCI
card,.. but should be compatible with PCI-X)
TerraTec Aureon 7.1 Universe Soundcard (which is actually a "normal" PCI
card,.. but should be compatible with PCI-X)
PCI-X bus B (133MHz) (one slots):
no card
Chris.
