First off, dbench is a bad benchmark to tune for, it shows better numbers
for worse fairness.
Is yourworkload like dbench?  What will your workload be?

Of course, there's 2.4.24 which has XFS merged for you, and be sure to give
2.4.25-pre6 a try since it integrates part of the -aa VM for inodes in
highmem.

There are options in XFS that change the layout of the filesystem that might
help (can't say more since I'm not too familiar with XFS).
Try without highmem, and see if that changes your results, and try with a
benchmark that behaves similair to how you expect from your workload.
Also, there's 2.6 which will give different characteristics, and especially
with the disk IO schedulers available there.
