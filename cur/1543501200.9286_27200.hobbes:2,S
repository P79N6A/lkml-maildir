Why does it have to be a computer?  Get a printer with a serial interface
and stick it right next to the failing box.  Supposing you don't have
one, if this is a mission-critical box, you should be able to shake loose
a few dollars for a used dot-matrix printer to help eliminate future
crashes that are costing you money.  Keep it around for the next crisis.

I miss the hardcopy console that, formerly, always came with a computer.
