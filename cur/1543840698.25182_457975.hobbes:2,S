Sheesh.

Right. How about putting it in as so that everyone can track
divergences, but to not use it for a real compile. Rather, consider it
meta-source, and do mechanical, repeatable transformations only,
starting with something like:
mv minilzo.c minilzo._c
cpp 2>/dev/null -w -P -C -nostdinc -dI minilzo._c >minilzo.c
lindent minilzo.c
to generate a version that can be audited. Doing so on a version of
minilzo.c google found on the web generated something that looked much
like any other stream coder source I've read, so it approaches
readability. Of a sorts. Further cleanups could be done with cpp -D to
rename some of the more bizarre symbols.
Downside is that bugs would have to be fixed in the 'meta-source'
(horrible name, but it's late here), but at least they could be found
(potentially) easier than in the original.
