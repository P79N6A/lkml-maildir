... and ugly enough to make one barf. WTF is "device"? Makes no sense for
procfs, for NFS, as the matter of fact for most of filesystems. How would
you like your "options", sliced or in one piece? Why? WTF is "/proc/xmounts"?
If it's an fs of its own - don't put it under procfs. Yodda, yodda..
Now, what's wrong with having 1 (.o.n.e.) text file instead of all that
hierarchy? \0 can't happen inside the names, so we can trivially use it
for separator. Dunno about you, but I _hate_ this braindamage with
replacing plain files with a metric buttload of little cute one-line
turdlets. And here you don't even have a pseudo-excuse that tends to be
uttered when it is done to something like /etc/inetd.conf (lusers who
package k3WlcR4pIRCd and can't be arsed to learn sed(1) or use the
standard script that should be provided by distribution). IOW, __please__
don't do that.
