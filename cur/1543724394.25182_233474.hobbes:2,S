Nope, B is implementation-defined.  The conversion from pointers to
integers is implementation-defined, and it's meant to be unsurprising
to those familiar with the architecture.  I.e., if you can
zero-initialize a pointer and get a NULL pointer back, it's quite
likely that a NULL pointer will convert back to (int)0, even though
it's not required by the C Standard AFAICT.
