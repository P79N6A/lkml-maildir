Make that

 ... that page is linked
from the 
http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net
 links page, and I'm glad to
see it's been updated recently.

I think that's a good approach for packaging that naming policy, though I'm
not quite sure where it stands in relation to "driverfs".  As with "usbfs"
it seems to me that there need to be both low-level "topological" and higher
level "logical/policy-driven" names.  And I'd prefer not to see a multiplicity
of approaches for anything except the bus-specific parts (which in this case
is "SCSI" even if the transport may be USB); I think I'm not alone in that.
Also, given what I noted earlier about stable IDs, I think SCSI_HOST should
be a stable string ID, not an integer that can easily get switched around
during system boot.
