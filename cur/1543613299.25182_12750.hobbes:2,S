I have maintained, on and off, a patch to crafms that supports traditional
cramfs decompress-and-read/run-from-RAM, plus direct mmaping with no
decompression and read/run straight out of ROM:
    
http://www.ltc.com/~brad/mips/cramfs-linear-root-xip-linux-2.4.9-2.diff
It includes a modification to mkcramfs to compress or not compress
individual files based on their +t mode setting.  Mkcramfs will leave +t
uncompressed in the cramfs image and cramfs will directly mmap them.
Please note that the patch is against 2.4.9.  I haven't tried to use it
since then.
Regards,
Brad
