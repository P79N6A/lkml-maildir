i was seeing a panic coming from the SCSI_SLEEP line in the following
chunk of code from scsi_do_cmd in scsi.c.    
    while (SCSI_BLOCK((Scsi_Device *) NULL, host)) {
        spin_unlock(&io_request_lock);  /* FIXME!!! */
        SCSI_SLEEP(&host->host_wait, SCSI_BLOCK((Scsi_Device *) NULL, host));
        spin_lock_irq(&io_request_lock);        /* FIXME!!! */
    }
             
the error was because SCSI_SLEEP was being called from within an irq
handler.  this problem appeared to come about because rw_intr from sd.c
called requeue_sd_request which in turn called scsi_do_cmd. if this
sequence takes place while host->host_blocked is set, however, the code 
will enter the loop and try to sleep which causes the error.  when using
the new_eh_code host_blocked gets set when scsi_mlqueue_insert is called
so the following sequence can lead to a hang.
1) queuecommand function returns 1
2) scsi_mlqueue_insert is called and host_blocked is set
3) some other scsi command enters rw_intr
4) rw_intr tries to queue up another command but it tries to block
included below is a patch which just checks for this error condition and
if it is found inserts the command in the mlqueue instead of trying to
block.
