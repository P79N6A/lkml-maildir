Thanks Michal, this was the problem. Unless x86_64 is going to receive an 
implementation of LATENCY_TRACE soon, it might be an idea to only let this be 
selectable on x86.
(Unfortunately I couldn't use the resulting kernel anyway, as my lirc modules 
hang the system when modprobe'd; it's probably easy even for me to fix if I 
inspect Ingo's rt-preempt patch.)
