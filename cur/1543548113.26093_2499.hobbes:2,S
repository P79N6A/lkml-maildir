'kmod' is part of the kernel, its source is part of the kernel source.

You 'get' kmod by configuring your kernel properly.  Use 'make
menuconfig'
or similiar.  Turn on "loadable module support" and "kernel module
loader"
The latter is kmod.
You also need the "modutils" package to actually have modules loaded.
The usual distributions comes with this, or get it from freshmeat.
