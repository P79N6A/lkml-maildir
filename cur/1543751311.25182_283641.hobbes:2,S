Hello lists,
Sorry to bother you with this probably beat-to-death issue, but I can't figure 
out the solution to the problem.
It's perfectly described in this archive thread:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/net/0308.1/0071.html
Basically it comes down to this:
I have an IBM server running RH ES, kernel 2.4.9-e.49. It has two interfaces:
eth0 10.0.22.xxx 
eth1 10.0.24.xxx
default gateway is set to 10.0.22.1, on eth0.
Problem is, if I try to ping from another network (10.216.0.xx) to 10.0.24.xx, 
i see the following ARP request:
arp who-has 10.0.22.1 tell 10.0.24.xx
which, imo, is wrong.
I know it has to do with the default gatway, but I can't devise a way to make 
it actually _WORK_.
Any pointers?
Thanks.
Jan
