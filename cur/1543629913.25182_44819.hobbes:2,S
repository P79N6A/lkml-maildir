Call trace is 
c01229ed -- bdev_read_page
c0134b5b -- __bread
That's stable (as expected). Under that, it was seen in
c0134a57 -- __getblk
	    blk_get_queue
	    ata_get_queue
Second try:
c0134a28 -- __getblk
	    __get_hash_table
Third try:
c0134a28 -- __getblk
c01343cc -- __get_hash_table
Fourth try:
c0134abd -- __getblk
... I should get some sleep I guess...
