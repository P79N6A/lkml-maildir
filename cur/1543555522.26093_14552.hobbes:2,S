I had a problem while compiling test11 on test9 kernel with debian
gcc-2.95.2. I had suspended the compilation with Ctrl-Z and it
continuted by compiling some garbage. Next time it compiled fine, so I'd
guess the files were ok in cache.
I do not know who is to blaim. Just thought to share this in case this
is the same problem.
