Take it from me - the scenario you give will cause deadlocks and problems.
There were other "generating an I/O would have cleaned up" type problems in
2.0.x < .35/6. They caused a lot of grief with installers where that 
I/O assumption is not true. Another classic case is large fsck's during
boot up.
So its not just a trivial irrelevant fix.
