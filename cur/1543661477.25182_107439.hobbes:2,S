   I wanted something like that a while ago, so I wrote a couple of
classes in C++ to handle regexps. Some of the test code looks like
this:
        string str = "fum foo";
	rejex exp("f(o*)");
	// Search for a regex
	if( s/exp )
		cout << "Found it!" << endl;
	// Count matches
	cout << s/exp << " matches" << endl;
	replace rep("g$0");
	// Search & replace
	str/exp/rep;
	cout << s << endl;
	// All in one
	"foo bar"/rejex("ba")/replace();
   It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it works.
I've not released it, because I haven't had a chance to get it into a
releasable form yet. Actually, looking at it, I should probably play a
couple of tricks with overloading operators to give you instead
   str =~ search/replace;
or even
   "str" =~ "search"/"replace";

   That's a good point, but I've always felt that the main problem
with perl isn't the regexes, but the rest of the language(*).
   Hugo.
