I gave 2.5.67-mm4 a go yesterday, and let it fsck my old 10gig ext3-ified 
source partition (1k bs, 333k files).  MAJOR improvement over deadline for 
this job.  With the deadline scheduler, it takes 30 minutes to fsck this 
partition, and when pdflush starts it's dinky little writes, it sounds like 
the heads are about to fly through the chassis.  The anticipatory scheduler 
cuts fsck time in half, and the disk is no longer screams in (seek) 
agony.  15 minutes still seems like ages when you're waiting, but it beats 
the HECK out of 30 minutes :)  Nice work.
