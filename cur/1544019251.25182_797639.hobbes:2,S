I didn't send the actual patch. The idea is,
	can't we use O_LOCK_FLAGS bit? I agree, it is a bit ugly,
	and I won't insist if you don't like is.
		static inline int try_lock_f_flags(struct file *file)
		{
			return !test_and_set_bit(O_LOCK_FLAGS, file->f_flags);
		}
		static inline set_f_flags(struct file *file, unsigned int flags)
		{
			file->f_flags = flags & ~O_LOCK_FLAGS;
		}
	Now, nobody should change ->f_flags directly (except create/open
	pathes. For example, ioctl_fionbio() should be changed:
			if (try_lock_f_flags(filp)) {
				if (on)
					set_f_flags(filp, filp->f_flags | flag);
				else
					set_f_flags(filp, filp->f_flags & ~flag);
			}
	If try_lock_f_flags() fails we do nothing, as if the current owner of
	O_LOCK_FLAGS changes ->f_flags after us.
and, from another message,
	No need to disable preemption, we never spin waiting for the
	lock bit. If it is locked - somebody else updates ->f_flags,
	we can pretend it does this after us. This can confuse F_GETFL
	after F_SETFL (if F_SETFL "fails"), but I think in that case
	user-space is wrong anyway, it must not do F_GETFL in parallel.
I'll try to make the patch tomorrow, but the problem is that I am not
sure this is not too ugly. At least Jonathan dislikes this approach,
and I do understand him ;)
Oleg.
