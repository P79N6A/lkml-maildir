If you don't know where the list is created, how do you now that it contains a 
ramdisk tag? There is a chance, that the kernel does not even get a ram disk 
tag at all. This would also explain, why it is not parsed ;-)
The tag list is supplied by your bootloader. How the bootloader creates the 
list and how to change the order depends on your bootloader. You probably 
have to read (and patch) it's source code.
