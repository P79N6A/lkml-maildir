Wrong. You are free to do whatever you like in the privacy of your home,
but not distribute the result. So you could very well distribute both
pieces, one under GPL, the other not, and leave the linking to the end
user.
Sure, /creating/ the piece to be linked with the GPLed code might make it
GPL also, but that is another story.

Not me. But it is not the only consideration involved.

nVidia doesn't want to tell, that is their decision to make. If they don't
tell, Linux users don't get to use nVidia cards with OSS drivers. Both
sides loose something, nVidia thinks (right or wrong) that what they loose
this way is less than what they'd loose by opening up.

That the "Linux kernel community" (whoever that might be) doesn't care
doesn't mean others wouldn't consider mining the Linux drivers for any data
on their competition.

Grey area... it could be argued that this is /public/ interfase to the
kernel, and as such shouldn't be closed off.

As long as the opposing zealots keep each other in check... ;-)
