Earlier I used latency_trace and figured that there was read contention
on mm->mmap_sem during call to _rt_down_read by java threads
when I was running volanomark.  That caused the slowdown of the rt
kernel
compared to non-rt kernel.  The output from lock_stat confirm
that mm->map_sem was indeed the most heavily contended lock.
