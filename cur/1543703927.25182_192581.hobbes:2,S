That is the tagged 2.6.1 release. I looked at what change set
(1.1474.2.29) the Makefile was in when the change from 2.6.1-rc3 to
2.6.1 took place, and exported that. I could take a kernel.org tarball,
but the result will probably be exactly the same.
2.6.1 works.
2.6.1 + bk changes from
http://linux-acpi.bkbits.net:8080/linux-acpi-test-2.6.1
 and
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5
 up until Monday 19th at about
12:00 GMT does not.
Boot params, configuration, everything as similar as can be.

Will do that in the morning. Almost bed-time here. :)
