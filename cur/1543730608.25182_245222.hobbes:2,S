Indeed. It is not ment to replace libcrypto - just a possibility if needed.

Yes, I think it may come handy in some scenarios. The algorithm is there
in the kernel so why not use it from the userspace?
Also (a wild guess) similar interface could provide access to some
key-management done in the kernel.

Why avoids? I don't force OpenSSH to use it and I agree that typically
the everything-in-the-userspace is better/faster. This is just an option
for situations where no other cryptolib is available.
On my todo list is adding a module option for selecting allowed
algorithms. Something like "allow=-ALL:+aes:+sha1".

Well yes, my driver actually reuses the API from OpenBSD. I have no
problem in changing (or extending) it but for now I did it this way for
easier testing with the OpenSSL cryptodev engine. This can definitely
evolve...
