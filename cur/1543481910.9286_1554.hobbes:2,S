This is a bug in Rules.make. I have a fix for this already (which btw
removes unnecessary recompilation of most of the kernel when module
versioning changes), but would like to tweak it a little bit more tomorrow,
then I'll post it.
Till then you have to either make mrproper, or just rm -rf
include/linux/modules/* and do make dep once again.
Cheers,
