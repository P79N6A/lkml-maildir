That sucks... Even if the clients are synchronised using ntp, there is
no guarantee that two almost-simultaneous setattr RPC calls can't race
and cause time to go backwards if they have to explicitly set to the
"current" client time.
However if you know the cases where time is set implicitly by the
server, why can't you simply optimise away the ATTR_CTIME and/or
ATTR_MTIME?
