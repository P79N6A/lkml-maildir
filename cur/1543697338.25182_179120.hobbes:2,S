Probably the second memory region is ROM - 'lspci -vvv' would clarify that.

Exactly.

Add a 'pcibios_fixup' routine for this platform, which does
	dev->resource[x].flags &= ~IORESOURCE_PREFETCH;
It can be either specific for that VGA controller (if it's built-in)
or for PCI devices with a class code of PCI_CLASS_DISPLAY_VGA or
(if that region is indeed a ROM) you can just mark ROM resources as
non-prefetchable for all PCI devices (i.e. x = PCI_ROM_RESOURCE).
