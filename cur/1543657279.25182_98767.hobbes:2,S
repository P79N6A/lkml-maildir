Subject: Bugs in 2.5.53-bk4: ide-scsi, cdrom, unix socket, /proc/stat
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

1) ide-scsi
Running kernel with these parameters:
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.5.53bk4 ro root=/dev/hda1 hdg=ide-scsi ide=reverse vga=4 hde=noprobe hdf=noprobe
at boot time it complains:
 scsi scan: host 0 channel 0 id 0 lun 0 identifier too long, length 60, max 50.
Device might be improperly identified.
at ide-scsi initialization and it freezes.
It is Teac CD-W512EB 2.0A.
2) if I disable hdg=ide-scsi than I got 
end_request: I/O error, dev hdg, sector 0
end_request: I/O error, dev hdg, sector 0
cdrom: open failed.
end_request: I/O error, dev hdg, sector 0
end_request: I/O error, dev hdg, sector 0
at any time someone access cdrom when cd is not inserted. Autofs has some
troubles with it. Any application is blocked until cd is inserted when using
autofs.
3) X server does not start at all complaining it cannot create listening socket.
On 2.5.52bk4 or 2.4.x is all OK.
4) I still do not see any disk_io line in /proc/stat so xosview does not show
disk usage.
