So which tool(s) do I need for getting at the 48-bit log data?  If I 
need a spec doc to decode a binary block of data I can deal with that. 
Prefer not to, but...
I did a full surface read scan of the disk and it turned up no errors.
As for how I got the SMART data dump I enabled SMART on the drive then 
dumped the data a few minutes later.
