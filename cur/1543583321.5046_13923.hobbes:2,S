Well, someone using ne2000 chipset have same problem-----drop connection
some people already post in mail list, but the sound like no one
interested about our problem
it will auto drop connection when used a long time ( over 24 hours )
I can not use ifconfig to restart the interface, so I must reboot the
kernel ( system )
I didn't reach this problem before, but in 2.4.x, I hope it will fix
soon and please help us to fix
my system config:
Cable modem
NE2000-PCI
problem type:
connection drop when used over 24 hours or more
Thanks
