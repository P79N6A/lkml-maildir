  If I understand correctly this unionfs feature would also be the cleanest 
way of changing the root filesystem after using an initrd ramdisk on boot. 
Currently the pivot_root call is used to change root but that still implies a 
bit of a hack. You can read about it on this fine paper:
http://www.cis.udel.edu/~zhi/www.docshow.net/linux/ols.zip
  It's also a good read if you want to understand the linux bootloaders and 
the boot process in general.
