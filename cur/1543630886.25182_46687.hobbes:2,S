err, sorry for no details in my first mail :( ... I have headache and
thinking is not good at all ;(
Its a module, an IDE 50x CD-ROM Drive, Company: LION and i used a ISO9660
CD. I used the following command:
mount -t supermount -o dev=/dev/cdrom none /mnt
/dev/cdrom is a symlink to /dev/scd0, i use ide-scsi for CD-ROM access.

hmm, strange :) ... i'm going to test it a little bit more ... Another
CD-Drive, other CD's ...
Kind regards,
