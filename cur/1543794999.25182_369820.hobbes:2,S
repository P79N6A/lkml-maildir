sure, i'll accept any sane patch. (quirky ones are OK too, as long as 
the effects are localized into an include file or so.)
but the type comparison feature is really essential to PREEMPT_RT. So 
unless gcc 2.95 has a comparable feature, i doubt it's doable.  
background: PREEMPT_RT relies on being able to implement build-time, 
"lock type dependent" function calls. I.e. 'down()' done on a semaphore 
will be built with a different function call than down() done on a 
compat semaphore. Or spin_lock() done on a raw spinlock leads to a 
different function call than spin_lock() done on a 'normal' spinlock.  
This solution implements a feature in C that is normally only found in 
object-oriented languages. It is an essential trick, as it reduces the 
size and impact of the -rt tree very significantly.
A completely type-unsafe (i.e. void * APIs with some runtime checking) 
solution is not acceptable - nor are separate per-type API namespaces.  
(such as compat_down(), etc.)
