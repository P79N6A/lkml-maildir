I had misinterpreted Jeff's post as saying defining
macros based on kernel configuration for conditional
compilation was not allowed.
With Andrew's technical explanation that altering
the CONFIG_X namespace in code is the problem,
the cleanest solution is to combine Randy's last patch
with fix-kbuild-dependencies-for-synclink-drivers.patch
I'll combine those two against 2.6.7-rc6-mm1
