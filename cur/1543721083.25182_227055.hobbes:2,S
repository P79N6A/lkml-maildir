This probably means that a CPU hog managed to get some interactive bonus 
points and the lower threshold stops them being taken away.

No.  Each task gets a fixed fresh time slice when it wakes up and at the 
end of an expired time slice.

The vanilla scheduler uses time slices to control "nice" and the 
allocated size varies widely.  The default value in SPA is the average 
of what vanilla would have awarded.  This is not necessarily the best 
time slice for interactive response with SPA.

It is indeed a tricky balancing act and it would be easier if more was 
known about the behavioural characteristics of the protagonists.  I have 
added a logging switch which when on will log the scheduling statistics 
for exiting tasks to the system log and I plan to use this to get an 
idea of the characteristics of the tasks involved in a kernel build.
I'm also writing a tool that can be pointed at a particular task (such 
as the X server) and gather time series data on the behaviour of that 
task using the statistics in /proc/<tgid>/task/<tid>/cpustats. 
Hopefully, that will help in working out the best settings or perhaps 
suggest other criteria that may be better for deciding interactiveness.
I had hoped that the throughput bonus would have helped in situations 
such as the one you describe, where several interactive tasks are 
fighting it out, by minimizing queuing.  I suspect that the reason it 
isn't helping is that a linear mapping from CPU delay to the bonus is 
inadequate as it means quite large discrepancies (20%) are required to 
get one bonus point.  I will look at modifying the mapping function to 
give more emphasis to small discrepancies.

You might also try increasing the promotion interval a little as this 
will accentuate the differences between the allocated priorities.
Thanks again for the feedback
