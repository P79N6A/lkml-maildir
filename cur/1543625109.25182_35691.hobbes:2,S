Hey team,
This is the message I posted just before Christmas last year.  The
following thread was quite long and many good arguments were posted pro
and con.  ESR decided to keep the KiB and MiB in Configure.help after
all was said and done, but then Linus split up an older version (v2.69
IIRC) which did not have these changes, performing a "pocket veto" of
the MB to MiB conversion.  Marcello did not accept any changes from ESR
after v2.69 also, so that whole discussion was made rather moot.
So rather than beating up on this horse which was already buried last
year, I suggest spending time more productively.
Steven
