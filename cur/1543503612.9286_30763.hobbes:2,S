I have been seeing exactly this.  It is not infinite, but it is pretty
long...it did stop eventually, after dumping the whole lot through a
serial terminal at 9600 baud.  I assumed it was something I was
screwing up in our IPSEC module, maybe not.
One side question, where do I change the serial baud rate?  If I
change it in lilo with an append= command, that only remembers the new
baud rate until the kernel has loaded, then goes back to 9600.  Why?
Where can I change it more permanently?

I didn't see this in 2.2.7 either.
