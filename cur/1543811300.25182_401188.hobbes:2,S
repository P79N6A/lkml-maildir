That's why I split Al's patch. Part 1/2 prevents sd from using values 
from buggy firmwares to overwrite memory where sd has no business to 
write at. As Al explained, the culprit is sd which feeds a too big len 
to scsi_mode_sense()'s memset(buffer, 0, len). Patch 2/2 adds an Initio 
specific workaround. (The 2nd part is not necessarily material for 
-stable, although it assures correct cache handling for Initio based 
SBP-2 HDDs.)
Please merge the sd fix ASAP (part 1/2). Users _are_ seeing memory 
corruption or panic in interrupt context without this patch. Fully 
reproducable, probably with all Initio SBP-2 bridges which exist; and 
these are actually popular chips for 1394a S400 as well as 1394b S800 
products, both noname and branded products.
The 2nd part could perhaps go through -mm. If you wish I resend it to 
Andrew. Al, what do you think? I believe this patch to be safe for 
non-broken devices though.
BTW I missed a small whitespace mishap in pt 2/2 which is why I should 
repost it anyway:
