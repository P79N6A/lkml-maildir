Actually, I find the BKL fairly surprising - we've whittled down all the
major non-lowlevel-FS offenders, and I didn't realize that it's still
there in do_exit().
And the do_exit() case should be _trivial_ to fix: almost none of the
code protected by the kernel lock in the exit path actually needs the
lock. I suspect you could cut down the kernel lock there to much
smaller.
The big case seems to be ext2_get_block(), we'll fix that early in
2.5.x. I think Al already has patches for it.
As to lseek, that one should probably get the inode semaphore, not the
kernel lock.
