Subject: PROBLEM: Can't get 2.3.41 to compile

Have just tried (several times) to build 2.3.41 on an i486. Have
patched the source 2.3.40.
It fails during ide.c
I get
In file included from ide.c:143:
/usr/src/linux-2.3.41/include/linux/pci.h:557: conflicting types for `pci_find_device'
/usr/src/linux-2.3.41/include/linux/pci.h:475: previous declaration of `pci_find_device'
/usr/src/linux-2.3.41/include/linux/pci.h:560: conflicting types for `pci_find_class'
/usr/src/linux-2.3.41/include/linux/pci.h:479: previous declaration of `pci_find_class'
/usr/src/linux-2.3.41/include/linux/pci.h:567: conflicting types for `pci_find_subsys'
/usr/src/linux-2.3.41/include/linux/pci.h:478: previous declaration of `pci_find_subsys'
make[3]: *** [ide.o] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.3.41/drivers/block'
I am not building in PCI support (due to ISA only motherboard).
Rather than spam the list with my .config and ver_linux output, they are

{config,ver_linux} if needed.
