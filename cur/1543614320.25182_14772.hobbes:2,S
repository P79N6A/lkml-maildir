hi,
i am exploring problems on linux-smp kernels (did not test single-processor) 
with version greater 2.4.14. In Fact i just tested 2.4.16 and 2.4.17.
Here's my problem:
I compiled all kernels with the same configuration with serial console-option 
enabled. With 2.4.14 everything is just fine: I see the kernel-output and can 
type in things during startup esp. do a fsck. With 2.4.16 and 2.4.17 i SEE 
everything but no input is accepted.
Did you break anything in 2.4.15 or 2.4.16. I of course did not test 2.4.15 
because of the fs-bug.
I will of course provide any information you request.
thanx
andreas
