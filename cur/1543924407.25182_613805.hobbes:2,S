Well, I don't want to remove it just yet, but it's going to be deprecated.
Also, after Johannes' remark I thought it wouldn't be a good idea to export the
bare test levels to the user.  For this reason I reworked the patches to use
strings instead of numbers for the test setting (the attribute is now called
"pm_test" and is used in a similar way to "disk").
I'll post the reworked series as soon as I update the changelogs and docs.
Greetings,
Rafael
