Sorry for the self reply.. looking at arch/sparc/lib/atomic32.c tells me that
local.h could use its own version that would only disable interrupts without
taking any hashed spinlock.
sparc64 seems to be a saner architecture providing atomic operations wrt the
local CPU. A barrier-free version of arch/sparc64/lib/atomic.S would improve
performance.
