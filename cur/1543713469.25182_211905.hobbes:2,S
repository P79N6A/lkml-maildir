I belive you have a glibc compiled with an old unistd.h. The epoll_ctl and 
epoll_wait functions seem that have been moved:
#define __NR_epoll_ctl_old      214  __SYSCALL(__NR_epoll_ctl_old, sys_ni_syscall)
#define __NR_epoll_wait_old     215  __SYSCALL(__NR_epoll_wait_old, sys_ni_syscall)
...
#define __NR_epoll_wait         232  __SYSCALL(__NR_epoll_wait, sys_epoll_wait)
#define __NR_epoll_ctl          233  __SYSCALL(__NR_epoll_ctl, sys_epoll_ctl)
while epoll_create have not. A asm trace into epoll_ctl or epoll_wait 
might confirm this.
