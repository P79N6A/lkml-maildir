Reading pci_restore_state() it looks already instrumented.  Sorry about the 
wrong pci device, looking at my BCM5788 it is pci device 08:04.0 and looking 
at the log from my first post there is nothing restored in the first 64 
bytes!  Otherwise it would have said "PM: Writing back..."
Is this what you are looking for or should I do other printk instrumentation?
