Well, we'll probably just live with using the relative expiry for the 
first pass, and then revisit this later once that is working, rather 
than resort to hacking it out by reading ->next_event.

Yeah, hopefully we can come up with a clean way to do this.  But, like I 
said early, until we do, we'll stick with the relative expiry.

I disagree.  The clocksource/clockevents layer are always going to have 
to convert nanoseconds to/from hardware units, so why not use it?  And, 
some guests (say, a future version of linux that does trace-based 
process accounting) may want higher resolution than nanoseconds for 
certain uses.  In any case, this is beside the point; I'd prefer to 
stick to using the clockevents interface in the way it was intended 
rather than reaching into ->next_event.
thanks,
