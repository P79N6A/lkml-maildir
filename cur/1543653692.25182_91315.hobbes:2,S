You can't receive a signal in a thread while it is forking anyway.
Erm, am I getting confused here?  I'm assuming that you can block
signals in _only_ the thread that is forking, leaving it unblocked in
the others.  I'm not very familiar with the current threaded signal
model - is the blocked-signal mask shared between all of them?
