Ok. I now see what you mean. In typical cases, only one path is used
to write. Meaning an app will decide to use the mmap path or the slow
write path and the kernel only ever reads from its pte entry (unless
fbcon is used which is not suited for this type of display). But you
are right that it is possible for a situation to arise where one app
does mmap and another is doing write. My hope is that something takes
care of flushing the data cache for me in this case. Do you recommend
I add something to force that? I'm worried about having an fbdev
driver that is too involved with mm.
Thanks,
