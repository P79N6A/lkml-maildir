Hi,
I have a server, with an Adaptec 19160 scsi card, a 3C905C NIC (possibly
not important) and an IBM 10k rpm U160, 18.1 gb scsi disk (lun 0). All was
working fine. I just upgraded the system with a 2nd IBM 10k rpm U160,
18.1 gb scsi disk (lun 3). It boots, I was able to partition the disk, and
do an install to the 2nd disk, so it seemed ok. Now (a few hrs later) I am
seeing a kernel panic.
The kernel is stock 2.2.16 kernel that I got from kernel.org.  The minor
modification is to install the patch for 3c90x driver that I got from 3COM.
The first line of the kernel panic is :
  (scsi0:-1:-1:-1) Referenced SCB 0 not valid during SELTO.
  SCSISEQ = 0x5a SEQADDR = 0x9 SSTAT0 = 0x10 SSTAT1 = 0x08a
  Then it attempted the operation again, and the Error message was :
  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address
  00000040 current->tss.cr3 = 00101000, %cr3 = 00101000
  *pde = 00000000
  Oops: 0000 
  CPU: 0
  EIP: 0010:[<801b55f1>]
  EFLAGS: 00010046
  .....
  ....
  Aiee, killing interrupt handler
  Kernel panic: Attempted to kill the idle task!
  In swapper task - not syncing
Both disks are on a proper LVD internal scsi cable, properly terminated.
Any thoughts as to what might be wrong ?
Any thoughts as to things to try to troubleshoot this ?
thx, and rgds,
