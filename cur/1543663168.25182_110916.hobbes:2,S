This is becoming a FAQ!  Did you enable the console in your .config?
CONFIG_VT=y
CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y
Most likely you chose to compile the input system as a module, which
caused the console options to be autohorribly deselected.  Just say 'y'
for the input subsystem, at which point the console options will reappear,
letting you select them.
I hope this helps,
Duncan.
