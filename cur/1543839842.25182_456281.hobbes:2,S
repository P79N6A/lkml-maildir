I think it would be more sensible for the default (i.e. user hasn't
explicitly configured any cpusets) behavior on a CONFIG_CPUSETS=y
kernel to match the behavior with a CONFIG_CPUSETS=n kernel.  Right
now we don't have that.  Binding a task to a newly added cpu just
fails if CONFIG_CPUSETS=y, but it works if CONFIG_CPUSETS=n.
