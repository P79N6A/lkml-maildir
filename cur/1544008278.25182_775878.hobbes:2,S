I tried that - I have seen no problems so far. But it is not the first time I 
did not see the problem for some time.
Btw, postgres just creates the database by copying over a default database.
For an easy test with sparse files, I created a big one, set it up as a loop 
device, created a filesystem and ran some stuff in it.
No Problem so far.

It definitely was before a reboot. And there were plenty of both, inodes and 
blocks.
I think that I have seen the problem on metadata only changes (find /tmp -type 
f|xargs touch) as well, but sometimes metadata changes were possible while file 
creation was not.
Another Datapoint: File deletion sometimes made it possible to create more 
files, but by far not as much as the space freed.

There were over 200GB free, so I doubt that. I don't know what could have 
caused an allocation of so much space unnoticed in an idle system multiple 
times.
But I do understand the reason for the question ;-)
