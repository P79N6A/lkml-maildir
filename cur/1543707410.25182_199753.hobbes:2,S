	Right now I am using Vmware 4.something in kernel 2.6.2-rc3 and will upgrade 
to 2.6.3 and im pretty sure it will work. Make sure you use the appropriate 
install script. Someone has published their own patches to make VMware more 
compatible w/ 2.6.
	Do a google for vmware-any-any-update49.tar.gz or updateXX where XX might be 
a newer version. I have not had any oopses with this package. The only 
problem I have is some older versions of the update package wouldnt compile. 
Perhaps you are insmodding a module built for 2.4 and crashing the kernel?
