Unless its a private network with locked vaults for the pipes, any
network is vulnerable.
I am not trying to downplay the relevance of this; all i am saying
is it may a little overhyped with the media being involved. Its
infact harder to create this attack compared to a simple SYN attack.

Unless i misunderstood:
You need someone/thing to see about 64K packets within a single flow
to make the predicition so the attack is succesful. Sure to have access to
such capability is to be in a hostile path, no? ;->

Any long lived flow with close to fixed ports. FTP from kernel.org could
be vulnerable - get a better client and its just becomes a nuisance.
80% of the internet traffic is still TCP/HTTP1.0 which is very 
short lived (there could be changes lately - these are numbers from 
a while back) i.e you wont see more than 8 packets i.e it is highly unlikely 
your traffic there is affected even if you used fixed ports.
