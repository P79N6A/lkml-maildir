Subject: 2.6.23-rc5 hangs on boot, apparently when initializing the EC

2.6.23-rc5-git1 hangs here, just before EC initialization.
Pressing the power button briefly makes it continue, then the
EC gets detected twice:
ACPI: bus type pci registered
PCI: Using configuration type 1
------------------ hangs here, press power button --------------------
ACPI: EC: Look up EC in DSDT
ACPI: EC: GPE = 0x10, I/O: command/status = 0x66, data = 0x62
ACPI: System BIOS is requesting _OSI(Linux)
ACPI: If "acpi_osi=Linux" works better,
Please send dmidecode to linux-acpi@vger.kernel.org
ACPI: Interpreter enabled
ACPI: (supports S0 S3)
ACPI: Using IOAPIC for interrupt routing
ACPI: EC: GPE = 0x10, I/O: command/status = 0x66, data = 0x62
ACPI: PCI Root Bridge [PCI0] (0000:00)
PCI: Transparent bridge - 0000:00:10.0
...
System is an HP TX1000 notebook with AMD Turion X2 processor,
running the x86_64 kernel. (And acpi_osi="Linux" doesn't seem to
make any difference.)
