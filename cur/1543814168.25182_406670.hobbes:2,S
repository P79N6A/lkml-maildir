From the NVidia drivers changelog:
2004-6-30 version 1.0-6106
    * Added support for GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language).
    * Added support for GL_EXT_pixel_buffer_object.
    * Added support for 4kstack kernels.
Looks like they managed to do that quite some time ago - in fact, before
some parts of the *in-kernel* code were totally cleaned up....
So yes, I *do* expect $COMPANY to re-write their driver to support 4K stacks. ;)
