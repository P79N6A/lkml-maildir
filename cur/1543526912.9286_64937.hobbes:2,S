I thought I understood what the change that has been made was; that
various UDP socket operations can no longer return ECONNREFUSED when
they receive an ICMP port unreachable.
Testing this does seem to confirm this -- but setting IP_RECVERR
doesn't seem to restore the previous behavior? Am I missing
something?
2.2.14:	Old (desirable behavior for some a particular application I
	have)
	socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 3
	sendto(3, "I had a little dog. His name was"..., 39, 0, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(80), sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}, 16) = 39
	select(4, [3], NULL, NULL, {2, 0})      = 1 (in [3], left {2, 0})
	recv(3, 0xbffffae8, 512, 0)             = -1 ECONNREFUSED (Connection refused)
2.3.47:	New (undesirable behavior)
	socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 3
	setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_NO_CHECK, [1], 4) = 0
	sendto(3, "I had a little dog. His name was"..., 39, 0, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(80), sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}}, 16) = 39
	select(4, [3], NULL, NULL, {2, 0})      = 0 (Timeout)
Oh, and I don't know if this is a bug or not, but 2.3.47 has the
`old' behavior still when you use connect() & write() as opposed to
sendto().
