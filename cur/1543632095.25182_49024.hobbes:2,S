But the id information is still available through the ioctl interface. 
ide_driveid_update was used to update the dma_ultra, dma_mword, and
dma_lword fields in the id structure after changing the rate with an
ioctl command.  Won't these fields be wrong if the rate is changed after
initialization?  Won't "hdparm -i" show outdated and incorrect
information.
It's good to see the duplicate identify routine go away, but the ioctl
shouldn't return incorrect information.  Can the remaining identify
routine be modified and called directly from the ioctl that returns the
id information?
