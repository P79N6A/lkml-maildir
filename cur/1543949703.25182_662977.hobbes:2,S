Hi Harvey,
   Thanks for the patch.  Currently asm/lguest.h is used for the guest/host 
interface definitions, while these are purely in-guest symbols.  The standard 
for these 'used from asm/declared in asm' seems to be to put the declarations 
in the C file directly.
   However, since this has already been applied to Linus' tree, it's fine.
Thanks!
Rusty.
