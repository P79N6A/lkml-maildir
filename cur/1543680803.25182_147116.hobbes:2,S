We can remove the d_invalidate(). See my response to your second
paragraph...
However as a more general argument: it is hard to avoid aliasing if
people are playing games on the server. If e.g. somebody does
mv foo bar
mkdir foo
on the server side while one of our processes was in the original
"foo" directory, it would IMHO be wrong not to allow us to d_drop()
the original dentry in order to allow other processes to access the
new "foo".

The d_invalidate() is not really crucial for the purposes of the
open(".")-type call, and could indeed be taken out. The main point as
far as NFS is concerned is the d_revalidate() call.
I will resubmit the patch with the d_invalidate taken out...
Cheers,
