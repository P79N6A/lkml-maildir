You look at network file system issues and generalize that to generic
networking. I am sorry but I do not think you know a whole lot about
high speed networking. You forget that when talking about fast
networking it depends on what you define as fast. Some people consider
file serving performance others are interested in fast memory to memory
transfers (from data aquisition servers to client processing units for
instance). For bulk data transfers on high speed networks (note I do not
consider 100Mbit/sec Fast Ethernet as being a fast network) the real
here issue is pipelining through socket buffers and large TCP windows
and not latency.
Besides, the fact that there are 90M netware boxes around doesn't matter
when most of them are running IPX - IPX is braindamage and has nothing
to do with proper networking.

I'd love to see a netware box sustain 110MB/sec (MB as in mega byte)
memory to memory in two TCP streams between dual 400MHz P2 boxes.
