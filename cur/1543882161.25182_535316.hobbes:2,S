I think Christoph is referring to the packet writing stuff, where we use
32kb or 64kb block sizes. Those aren't implemented as page cache hacks
currently though, the issue is worked around at the block layer level by
doing software RMW.
Supporting larger page cache blocks would allow pktcdvd to be reduced to
almost nothing.
