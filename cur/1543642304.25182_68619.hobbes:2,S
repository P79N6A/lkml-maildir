You didn't think it through.
The current behaviour is a BUG.
A fast disk driver will _never ever_ do a partial request completion. A 
high-performance subsystem will put in the scatter-gather list and say 
"go" to the controller, and the controller will send exactly one interrupt 
back when it is all done.
So for such a system, you'd never see partial completions anyway.
Partial completions are a feature of slow hardware. And slow hardware is 
exactly when we want to know about it.
So my approach has no downsides, only upsides.
