Thanks for the Cc Rafael.
The aforementioned patch matches three commits - mostly bugfixes - which
went in between 2.6.27 and 2.6.28:
commit ccdffb9a88b2907b159538d7bfd6256621db4f84
    r8169: get ethtool settings through the generic mii helper
commit 2857ffb7b8913ef713533ac5783abd70a20529e4
    r8169: additional 8101 and 8102 support
commit 523a609496dbc3897e530db2a2f27650d125ea00
    r8169: fix RxMissed register access
Frank, can you:
1. try the r8169.c file from the 2.6.28 tree with Ubuntu's kernel
2. grep for the XID line printed by the r8169 driver in the lernel's dmesg
If 1. does not work , you can peel the onion with the patchkit available
at 
http://userweb.kernel.org/~romieu/r8169/2.6.27/
 : apply them in
increasing order to your working Ubuntu driver until is stops waking
up correctly (skip patches #0001, #0006 and #0007 as they match the
commits above) or try a binary search.
As a side note for those who remember the early 2.6.27-rc "null mac
address with the r8169 driver", the patchkit does not include the
patches which were included between 2.6.27 and 2.6.28 then later
reverted.
