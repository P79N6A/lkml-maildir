 From some browsing of the kernel source and a useful article on lwn.net 
I think I can replace all the readpage_xxx (symlink, readpage & 
readpage4k) kmap/kunmaps with kmap_atomic(page, KM_USER0)/kunmap(kaddr, 
KM_USER0)...
The lwn.net article mentions that k[un]map_atomic is the new alternative 
to kmap (as Andrew Morton mentioned).
I've noticed in asm-ppc/highmem.h the following comment
/*
  * The use of kmap_atomic/kunmap_atomic is discouraged - kmap/kunmap
  * gives a more generic (and caching) interface. But kmap_atomic can
  * be used in IRQ contexts, so in some (very limited) cases we need
  * it.
  */
Given what Andrew and the lwn.net article says, this comment is rather 
confusing.  Is it wrong?
