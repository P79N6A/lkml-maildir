This is the bogus lockdep output which is fixed by
commit ea319518ba3de282c13ae1cf4bf2215c5e03e67e

    locking, percpu counters: introduce separate lock classes
    Impact: fix lockdep false positives
    Classify percpu_counter instances similar to regular lock objects --
    that is, per instantiation site.
    The networking code has increased its use of percpu_counters, which
    leads to false positives if they are treated as a single class.
