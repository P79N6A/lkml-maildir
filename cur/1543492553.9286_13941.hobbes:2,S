   It won't solve the `old kernel' problem.
   If you overload setuid bit functionality, it will open a security hole
on older kernels not understanding this extension. (It can bite you only
if you share files between machines running different kernels or if you
switch kernels on the same machine, though.)
   If you use the sticky bit for this purpose, a similar situation
can happen: a normal user sets the sticky bit for a file when running
an old kernel where it isn't restricted and then the file becomes
privileged after switching kernels. This can be solved by ignoring
the sticky bit on files not owned by root.

   Parsing file contents in sys_chmod() is plain ugly.
				Have a nice fortnight
