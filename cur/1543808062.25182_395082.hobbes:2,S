Ok.  I have to pick a nit here.  Needing all new tools top/ps/kill was an artifact
of your implementation.  Mine does not suffer from it.

Agreed.  When using a PID namespace the code always behaves the same.
Which is with more arguments than the code used to have.
However the code always behaving the same is a tremendous advantage
for maintainability.

I am willing to be convinced but so far there seem to be other solutions
like running gdb_stubs inside your container.  To address most of the issues.
In a fairly real sense mucking with a container from the outside appears
to be a sysadmin layering violation.

The historical linux approach is to build things out of tasks sharing
resources that give the impression of containers not out containers
and their children.  I am still trying to understand why that model
does not work in this instance.
