Right.  We can even do this earlier in the pci code.  Just doing this
on demand when the device driver needs it is problematic.  As devices
drivers like to keep the requested over a pci_disable_device pci_enable_device
pair.
The big practical issue is that we will like wind up allocating an irq
number to all usable irqs on ia64.  Which means we will like need many
more irq numbers...  Although I guess if we keep it at the pci layer
we should be fairly safe.
I was afraid there was some hotplug reason for waiting until pci_enable_device
to allocate the irq numbers.

Thanks.  Then small surgery will happen now, and I will start queuing up
the major surgery patches.  Although I won't be able to do more than
compile test and code review the ia64 changes.
