Thanks for explaining.

The USB controller. That's device 00:07.2:
00:07.2 USB Controller: Intel Corporation 82440MX USB Universal Host Controller (prog-if 00 [UHCI])
        Control: I/O+ Mem- BusMaster- SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop-  ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B-
        Status: Cap- 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B+ ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
        Interrupt: pin D routed to IRQ 11
        Region 4: I/O ports at fcc0 [size=32]
I never tried the Winmodem, because I don't need a modem. It came free
with the laptop.
