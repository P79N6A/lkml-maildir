Acks _are_ vector specific. It's just that you don't need to specify the
vector, because the local APIC knows which one it must be (very simple: it
must always be the highest-priority in-service irq).

The nesting is always ok, because the local APIC knows which interrupts
are in service, and thus also knows which one is "active" (the highest
priority in-service one).
I personally think it's a stupid design (it would be so easy for software
to just explicitly say _which_ IRQ to ACK, and I don't see the point of
not requireing that and make it explicit), but it's straightforward.

No, why would it be?
Doing an __sti in interrupts will let higher-priority interrupts in. As it
always has.
I think it's probably stupid most of the time, and shows that something is
wrong (an interrupt should not take long enough for it to matter that we
do an __sti), but sometimes that kind of stupidity is a result of horrible
hardware latencies (eg the time it takes to read a sector from the IDE
disk using programmed IO).

That would be a horrible bug, and would ALWAYS have been a horrible bug.
Quite regardless of how you do interrupts: it doesn't matter where youput
the ACK's, you always need to make sure that irq masking etc is correct,
and you must NOT allow a context switch while an interrupt handler is
still running.
The kernel _only_ does a process switch on return to user level. That very
much includes the case above; the timer interrupt obviously is not
returnign to user level.
You're making these problems up.

I agree. I think interrupt controllers should be simple masks, nothing
more, nothing less.
However, I'm not designing the hardware.
