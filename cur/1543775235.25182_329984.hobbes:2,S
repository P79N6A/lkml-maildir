I would recommend libsmbios application available at
http://linux.dell.com/libsmbios
 we are working on updating this page to
include instructions on using this App with dell_rbu. Please check on
this link for any updates. Also the dell_rbu.txt will be updated with
the link to this page once it is complete.
