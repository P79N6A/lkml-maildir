Okay. Its possible that my understanding was wrong in the sense that I
thought bus testing procedure is mandatory to support 8-bit cards. If
8-bit is mandatory for MMC4 cards, then the changes required in the
MMC core to support 8-bit might be  simple. Based on host controller
cap this can be handled.
Philip asked me about the access to the 8-bit controller. We might not
be able to provide you direct access to the hardware platform as it
requires involvement of business managers and so on. But can I be of
help by testing your code on our platform and leting you know the
results?
Regards,
Madhu
