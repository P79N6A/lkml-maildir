It seems far less complex to simply let the driver do what it needs to
do, in the time it needs to do it.  The probe step in current drivers
for example could take anywhere from less than a second to several
seconds, depending on what needs to be done.
Though like I mentioned in a previous mail, if you have a two-stage
save-state step, a lot of those delays can be parallelized:  in the
first save-state the driver stops the hardware from accepting further
transaction, and initiates I/O request completion (where possible).  The
second save-state cleans up any outstanding transactions and shuts the
rest of the hardware down.
