Yes it does - it allows me to write the obvious code instead of the
gross hack from my original article. Having said that, it is unclean
in that the side-effect of sys_capset is extremely non-obvious; I'd
probably be happier making the state change explicit with prctl().

Does bind really benefit from this treatment? It already has a -u, -g
and -t options to change the user, group, and chroot point
respectively. Using -u does stop you changing which port the server is
bound to without restarting the program but that's hardly a great
problem. Capabilities don't solve the inability to change which port
is bound since cap_net_bind_service is equivalent to root on most
machines.

There are another couple of issues regarding capabilities which concern me.
1) Permitted capability set for setuid programs
I want setuid root programs not to have all capabilites. cap_bound is
not the answer since I still want some programs that are started from
the system initialisation scripts to run with all capabilities.
2) Inherited capability set for setuid programs
It is possible to run a non-capability-aware setuid-root program from
an environment that has cap_setuid-i. This prevents the program from
using setuid() to demote privilege back to a non-zero uid (unless that
uid was the real, effective or saved uid). This is a security risk
since the program might retain the ability to write to any file on the
system owned by root. When doing setuid root emulation, the inherited
rights mask should not be honoured.
