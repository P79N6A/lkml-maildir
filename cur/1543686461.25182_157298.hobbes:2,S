Ok, now I tried a kernel without the 
"hwif->addressing = (hwif->channel) ? 0 : 1"  line in pdc202xx_old.c,
and yes, now the 160GB drive works without aliasing parts above 137GB
back to the beginning of the drive.
Some simple tests (reading and writing a few 100MB of data) didn't show
any nasty side effects. If you want me to do additional tests, please
tell me. At the moment the drive doesn't contain any data, so I can even
try dangerous things.
