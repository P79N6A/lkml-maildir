Larry normally talks about the number of conceptual locks.  So in order
to manipulate a `struct file', it really doesn't matter whether you have
to grab the BKL, the files_struct lock or the filp->lock.  There's a big
difference if you have to grab the filp->pos_lock, the filp->ra_lock and
the filp->iobuf_lock.  You'd have to know what order to grab them in,
for a start.
