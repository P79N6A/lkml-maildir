Nothing wrong on your side. I took a look at the second one, and
everything but the whitespace changes already found its way into Linus'
tree via 1a4f550a09f89e3a15eff1971bc9db977571b9f6. One hunk of the
original patch[1] was actually made redundant because the code was
removed in that commit, so that's probably what James fixed (see full
commit message).
And then, if I may guess, James probably just noticed that there were
changes left and commited them (while they were now down to just the
whitespace change), without checking what changes were actually left (no
offense intended). At least I think that git wouldn't cripple the diff
if the changes that James checked in were not already whitespace-only at
the time he commited them, and the git history of his tree seems to
agree.
Probably the other commit is similar.
