Hmm, do you mean returning different directory contents based on uid?

Well, it works that way currently, and there doesn't seem to be any
real problem with it.

I don't really understand what you mean by "local".
The problem with this leaf node philosophy, is that it's not really
consistent.  You can ensure that a mountpoint is a leaf node at mount
time, but you can force it to remain a leaf node after the mount.  So
I don't see why this check at mount time would make _any_ difference.

Ahh, right.
The info leak argument still holds, but it's pretty weak.
So if the current behavior causes a problem for sombody, and relaxing
the check from ptraceability to killability fixes it, then I'll
consider doing it.  Until then, let's keep the more secure check.
