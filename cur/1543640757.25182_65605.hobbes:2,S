The good news:  I ran my dbench 1..128 stress test and for the first
time since 2.5.31-vanilla there were _no_ BUG()s reported at all.
The other news:  from dmesg:
kjournald starting.  Commit interval 5 seconds
EXT3 FS 2.4-0.9.16, 02 Dec 2001 on sd(8,3), internal journal
EXT3-fs: mounted filesystem with ordered data mode.
kjournald: page allocation failure. order:0, mode:0x0
The kjournald failure message came out with dbench 48 running on an ext3
partition.  The test continued with only this one instance of this
message.
