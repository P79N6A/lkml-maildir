Swsusp will use the portion of your swap partition that is unused when
you start to suspend. The version currently in the 2.5 tree frees most
of your memory before suspending, and so doesn't need that much swap at
all. The version that I'm working on merging only frees memory if it is
necessary to fit the image in the available swap or to have enough
memory to be able to save the image. Thus, you need a lot more swap for
my version. (eg. I have 640MB ram on my laptop and a ~700MB swap
partition).
Hope this helps.
Regards,
Nigel
