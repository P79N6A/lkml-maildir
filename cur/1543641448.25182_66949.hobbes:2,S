Because kdb, kgdb and kprobe want to use int3 so it must be used only if
the config option is enabled.

It's better: first, if it is supported we have no faults.
Second, in some cases (e.g. movntq) it's not possible without adding
extra padding when using int xx (and int3 can't be used for the reason
above).

Not possible. See above.
This could be fixed by checking whether the opcode is not one generated
or recognized by the dynamic fixup code, assuming that nothing else can
change the code.
However, this fails to detect "impossible" cases like cpus that should
understand prefetches but that don't.
