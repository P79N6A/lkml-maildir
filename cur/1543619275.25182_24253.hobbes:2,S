No.  What you described is diff/patch.  We have that already and if it
really worked in all the cases there would be no need for BitKeeper to
exist.  I'll be the first to admit that BK is too pedantic about change
ordering and atomicity, but you need to see that there is a spectrum and
if we slid BK over to what you described it would be a meaningless tool,
it would basically be a lot of code implementing what people already do
with diff/patch.
