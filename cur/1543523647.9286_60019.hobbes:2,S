2.2.10-ac11
In case you're wondering why: almost no 2.2.x kernel is usable (at my
work) because they all suffer from an NFS client bug which is fixed by
Trond's patch I'm using in 2.2.13. Without this patch, redirecting setuid
program output to an NFS mounted FS fails: data is discarded because I/O
is done with the credentials of the calling process (e.g. setuid root)
instead of the opener of the file.
