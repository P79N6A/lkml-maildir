I don't recall (void) being in early C.  Perhaps it was added as
part of the ANSI Standardization effort.  I doubt that the first
edition K&R [1978] has it.  But my copy is not at hand to verify
this.
I continue to use it in userspace code to document that I'm ignoring
a return value.  This habit likely began when I had to suppress lint
warnings about unused function returns at some point in my career.
