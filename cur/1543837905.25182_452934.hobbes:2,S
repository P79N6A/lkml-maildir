I think I have found the 'something silly'.  Here is a patch that allows
our Dell em64t boxes to boot.  This change matches the original code.  The
main difference that caused the problems was the setting of _PAGE_NX bit.
This caused issues in early_io_remap().  
Thanks to Larry Woodman for debugging this.  
Cheers,
Don
