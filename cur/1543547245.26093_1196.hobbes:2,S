One day I hope you'll explain to us why this is not 2.2.17pre21...
Either you are sure pre20 is going to be the official 2.2.17,
or I'm missing something. 
And now that I look closer, you used the work 'Fix' a lot in the
changelog.
It won't be a great idea to release 2.2.17 with many outstanding bugs
(however little they are...).
