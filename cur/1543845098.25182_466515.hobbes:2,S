Your machines spend 15 seconds in drivers? Ouch, I did not realize
_that_. 
(My machine suspends in 7 seconds, perhaps 2-3 of that are playing
with drivers, so I just failed to see where the problem is).
Are these your big SMP servers? Any SCSI involved?
Rafael has "fakesuspend" patches somewhere, but you can probably just
swapoff -a, then echo disk > /sys/power/state. If you are lucky, that
should be slow, too... fortunately you'll have useful dmesg buffer
when you are done. CONFIG_PRINTK_TIMING or something, and you should
have enough clues...?
15 seconds spend within drivers is definitely _not_ okay.
