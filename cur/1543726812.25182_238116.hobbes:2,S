Kernel and cdrecord disagreement, news at 11.

I appreciate the good intentions, but perhaps you should research a bit
of background on this before going over board here. Don't think it
hasn't been suggested to Joerg before to kill that message.
Look at the errors as well - one is about the transport used:

The other (for SG_IO)

just says that open-by-device name is unintentional, it doesn't give you
warnings on the transport.
So in short (and repeating): don't use ATAPI (CDROM_SEND_PACKET), it
sucks. Use SG_IO (which means using open-by-device, which works at least
as well as the stupid faked ATAPI bus/id/lun crap and has the much
better transport). Don't compare apples and oranges.
