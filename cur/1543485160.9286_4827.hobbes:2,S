Well after all the testing I did I began going throught the 2.1.102 patch
one section at a time, I backed out the irq.c changes, I lokked hard at the
ipchains stuff and concluded that since I wasn't compiling with
CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL that these couldn't be causing the problem, the
scheduling updates were almost all text comments, so only one other file of
any consequence was updated, the ibmmca.c driver for my PS/2 SCSI
controller.
The update was the switch from cli/sti to the save_flags/restore_flags.
Almost (maybe even all) of the scsi drivers were updated with this change in
the 2.1.102 patch.  Interestingly backing this patch out made my ppp
problems go away.  I went ahead and did the same to the 2.2.1 tree,
recompile and my P70 is streaming along again, PPP works great not, no FRAME
errors reported anymore, everything is as it should be.
Now my question, while so far I can see no ill effects to the switch to
cli/sti, I would like to know what's bad about it?  I found the code in
question and it just doesn't look like it should have such an impact.  Is
the cli/sti method totally depreciated.  Basically, I have no idea how to
fix this driver the correct way, but my way is working fine for me.
I need feedback,
Thanks,
Tom
