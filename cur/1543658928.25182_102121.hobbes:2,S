Richard,
Thanks for the response. 
Even if I can get the map information using the INT
0x13h disk interrupt, I would still need some way of
knowing if sda has indeed failed. 
What I am thinking of if it is possible to make the
"boot" option in lilo.conf variable. Or better,
introduce a serial# option and the serial# can be
scanned for on startup. Or make use of a lun# option. 
I was also thinking if BIOS id's for the disks can be
used here. Are BIOS id's assigned for all drives?
Thanks
Manish
