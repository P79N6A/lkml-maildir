That sounds good. I'll be keeping an eye out for that one :)

True, there are a lot of players involved here, although XFS seems (to

Nice. Will be good to get that in.

I'll try to extract a copy of each unique trace that involves xfs,
sometime tomorrow or the day after, and then send you the result.
