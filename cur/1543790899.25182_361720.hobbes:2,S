fud.  Every -mm release is built with allmodconfig on x86 and on x86_64. 
It's also cross-compiled on fat configs for alpha, ppc32, ppc64, sparc64,
arm and ia64.  It's booted on x86, x86_64, ppc64 and ia64.  Every release.
Yes, some tty drivers have been busted in recent releases, as described in
the release notices.  That's why the tty patches are at the end of the -mm
series: so I can back them off for the allmodconfig builds.
I usually do allnoconfig and allyesconfig, too.
