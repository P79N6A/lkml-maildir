It is different because yours is coming from __alloc_pages, so if there
are no previous warnings then it means it wasn't corrupted before last
being freed, so it is a use-after-free bug. I'm surprised at how many
fields have been modified though (mapping, count, mapcount).
PG_error is set, which might mean it is a bug in an error handling path
that doesn't trigger very often.
