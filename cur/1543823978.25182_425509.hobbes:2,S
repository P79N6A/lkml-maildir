Yes - the wrong question because it's too top down and encourages
hacks :)  It's wrong for the purposes of planning an implementation, but
ok for easing minds about what will be covered, I think.

My guess would be most of the points under "isolation".  The others are
really just fine tuning / resource partitioning and fixing various
