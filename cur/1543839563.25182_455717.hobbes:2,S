Subject: [PATCH] x86_64: fix linking on 32-bit system
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

When compiling a 64-bit kernel on an Ubuntu 6.06 32bit system (whose GCC is also
a cross-compiler for x86_64) I've seen that head.o is compiled as a 64-bit file
(while it should not) and ld complaining about this during linking:
ld: warning: i386:x86-64 architecture of input file
`arch/x86_64/boot/compressed/head.o' is incompatible with i386 output
I've verified that removing -m64 from compilation flags to turn
"-m64 -traditional -m32" into "-traditional -m32" fixes the issue.
