One possibility is that something relies on schedule_task() - keventd
doesn't run with realtime priority and can be starved.
Seems to be the case indeed: 
/usr/src/linux/drivers/char% grep schedule_task *.c
console.c:      schedule_task(&console_callback_tq);
...
the console switch does.
Fixing it would require boosting keventd's priority either globally 
or temporarily. E.g. if the original reporter could put this
(untested/uncompiled) at the beginning of kernel/context.c:context_thread():
    current->policy = SCHED_RR;
    current->rt_priority = 99;
it could fix his problem.
