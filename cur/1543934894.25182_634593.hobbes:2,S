I had a .config (I deleted it) that fails to build *but* using the tree from 
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/eranian/linux-2.6.git;a=summary
The problem was that CONFIG_NUMA wasn't defined so ENABLE_TOPO_DEFINE wasn't 
defined too and then we get an error about an implicit declaration 
of 'topology_physical_package_id'.
