Memory policies do not work reliably with config highmem (I have never 
seen such usage because large memory systems are typically 64 bit 
which have no highmem, but there are some 32bit numa uses of HIGHMEM) ....
Memory policies are only applied to the highest zone. So if a system has 
highmem on some nodes and not on the others then policies will only be 
applied if allocations happen to occur on the highmem nodes.
