Is the problem MTRR resume must be with IRQ enabled, right? Could we
implement a method sysdev resume with IRQ enabled? MTRR driver isn't the
only case. The ACPI Link device is another case, it's a sysdev (it must
resume before any PCI device resumed), but its resume (it uses semaphore
and non-atomic kmalloc) can't invoked with IRQ enabled. I guess cpufreq
driver is another case when suspend/resume SMP is supported.
Thanks,
