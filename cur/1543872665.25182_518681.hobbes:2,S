you could perhaps try what X's modesetting utility does: display a 
dialog box that times out if it does not get clicked on, and reboot if 
it did not get clicked on. Likewise, detect upon the next bootup that a 
suspend-test was in progress (and didnt get back via normal resume), via 
some temporary file. That way both the 'did not resume and i had to 
power-cycle' and the 'resume did not restore my X' problems can be 
handled.
Finally, when the correct options have been established (worse-case with 
a small number of reboots and "yes, indeed the resume did not work fine" 
clicks done upon bootup by the user), automatically fill in a webform in 
firefox and ask the user to do a single click to submit that form.
techniques like that have more chance i think to get Linux 
suspend/resume anywhere near to working. The current 'rely on the 
developer' technique apparently does not work.
