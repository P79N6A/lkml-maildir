Subject: [PATCH] [1/4]: Ext2/3 updates: Fix/simplify alternate superblock logic
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Fix/simplify alternate superblock logic
Fix bugs when specifying an alternate superblock as a mount option; not 
all of the cases where a alternate sb was specified and a block device
whose hardware blocksize was not 1024 worked correctly (and the failure
mode was different for ext2 and ext3).  The code has been tightened up
and simplified, so that it is right in all of the permutations of these 
cases.
