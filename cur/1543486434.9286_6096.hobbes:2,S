Subject: ad1848.c: sound card clicks with v3.8o, but not 3.5.4-beta8

I use the cs4232 and ad1848 drivers for my Turtle Beach Malibu sound
card.
  Under kernel 2.2.1 it clicks before every playback or recording (I
would think every time the device is opened). 
  Under 2.0.35, it would only click twice - when the sound module driver
was first loaded, and the very first time a sound file was played.
Browsing through the code, it seems like ad1848.c has been through some
major revisions. Among other things, ad_mute has been changed and
ad_unmute does nothing... Can it be that some mute doesn't take effect?
Or is the card being shut down a bit too much on close()? 
While I'm writing, where is the best documentation on how to do full
duplex audio? I'm trying to play and record from two separate POSIX
threads. It is working ok, but it would be nice with some specifics
documentation on what is allowed and not wrt reading and writing,
blocking, etc.
Please cc: any replies to me.
  Thanks!
