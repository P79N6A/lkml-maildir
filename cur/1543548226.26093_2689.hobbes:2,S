Hello,
I've uploaded the new version of user beancounter patch which introduces
control of system resources and protection for users against misbehavior of
other user's processes.
The recent changes include:
 - new memory accounting (including pro rata accounting for shared pages) and
   guarantee system for resident pages and out-of-memory situations
   (since version IV-0007);
 - more resources are accounted (including number of pseudo terminals, file
   locks);
 - improvements of /proc output;
 - bugfixes (a couple of reference counter leaks).
The patch is against 2.4.0test7 kernel and is available at
ftp://ftp.sw.com.sg/pub/Linux/people/saw/kernel/user_beancounter/user_beancounter-IV-current
ftp://ftp.swusa.com/pub/Linux/people/saw/kernel/user_beancounter/user_beancounter-IV-current

ftp://ftp.sw.com.sg/pub/Linux/people/saw/kernel/user_beancounter/UserBeancounter.html

is also updated (memory management changes, socket buffer accounting problems
and possible solutions, plans for the future, changelog).
