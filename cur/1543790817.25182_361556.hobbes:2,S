And is there a docmentation on how to find which RNG device you have?
Or is there lsrng (like lspci) :-)
Most of the device names I have never heard of, but working with 5+ MB vendors and all the different
models of MB I really have no idea where do I have this and that...
So, any method of autodetecting a RNG device?
And a question, I always wanted to ask: is there a cheap hardware random device usable in linux that
is PCI/USB/serial whatever pluggable? For MBs without RNG in the chipset.
Kalin.
