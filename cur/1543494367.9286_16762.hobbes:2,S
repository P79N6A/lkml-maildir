Hi,
I have a spare machine that I would like to do some simple tasks here, for
which no terminal (and access control) is really needed. For this, I
thought it would be easiest to have one of these small numeric panels that
sell for a few dollars, connected to the parallel port or serial port, and
execute arbitary commands for each digit (e.g. according to a configuration
file), controlled by a daemon or some user-space program.
The question is, before I start reinventing the wheel, has anyone done this
already, can I have a look at it, and how expensive would the extra
hardware be? I don't think it would be just the panel...
