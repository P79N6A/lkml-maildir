Yes.  At some point, I'd like to make that an error - if you want to
restart with a signal, don't do it from the notification points where
it doesn't make sense (exit, fork, vfork-done, syscall).  Send a signal
by hand, and then resume, and if you want to fudge the siginfo you can
do that when stopped in the signal delivery path.
