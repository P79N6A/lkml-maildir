     I would very much like this, I saw something like this somewhere, I think
on the Stack Guard site, but unfortunately when I tried to download it it said
it wasn't ready yet. 
     Anybody know where a patch that does this now can be obtained?
     Stack Guard unfortunately, to the best of my knowledge, is only ported to
x86, anybody know of a Sparc port?
     And I would still like to have the option of a non-executable stack.  Even
if daemons are running as another UID other than root, I would still rather not
give an outside attacker a shell on my hosts from which to launch inside
attacks.
     Even if Stack Guard were ported to Sparc, it's too easily gotten around,
and while a non-executable stack can also, it's more difficult and there isn't
anything obvious to me that would prevent both from being used.
     And there is no reason I can see why both can't be used AND daemons can't
run as something other than root.
     There are cases though where it's difficult to get around, for example,
ftpd which has to do authentication and change ot a users UID.  How do you do
this without root?
