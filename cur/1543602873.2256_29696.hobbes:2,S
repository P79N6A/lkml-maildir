Hi!
Here's minimal version of swsusp, for 2.4.10. make -j 5 bzImage,
startx, suspend. When it boots, suspend again, and when that boots,
suspend again. Now it resumed, and I still can write this email. That
looks good.

PS: Gabor, this might be good candidate to put on webpage
somewhere. (But beware, I stripped everything non-essential out).
PPS: Alan, would you consider putting this to -ac somewhere?
