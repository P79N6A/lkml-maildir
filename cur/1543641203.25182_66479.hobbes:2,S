Well, that was fun! I checked that on entry into the devices
open function, the file->f_iobuf field was null, and then called
alloc_kiovec on it while I set the O_DIRECT flag on file-_f_flags.
The result was that all read/write calls on the device failed
with EINVAL! Whee!
But ioctls worked. Apparently I am supposed to fill out
some more fields of something else with some methods. Hmm. OK.
I'll look. I guess this will be the a_ops field of i_mapping.
