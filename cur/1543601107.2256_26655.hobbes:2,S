Exactly the same here. I've been playing some time with extra keys,
either on PC keyboards and notebooks. My Compaq Presario 1926 just acts
like yours when I hit these extra keys: nothing to be seen. Maybe a
dedicated I/O port? Haven't tried yet.
I've also seen two other cases: keys generating NMIs (yes!) and keys
directly "attacking" hardware. In either case, showkey -s doesn't show
anything. On all desktop PC keyboards that I could lay my hands on
otherwise, it generates e0 xx scancodes on press and e0 (xx | 0x80) on
release. Some of these scancodes even seem to be standard (volume up and
down, play and pause key...). I made a dedicated driver to handle these
keys for 2.2 already. Not yet ported to 2.4.
