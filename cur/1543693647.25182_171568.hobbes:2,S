Ok, this seems to be due to the move of the job control fields from
the task structure to the signal structure.
That looks like a bad idea, and the best thing to do is likely to just
revert the whole thing.
If you are a BK user, do a "bk changes" to find the ChangeSet that says
"[PATCH] move job control fields from task_struct to", and just do a
        bk cset -xX.XXXX
where X.XXXX is the changeset number in your tree (that will depend on
exactly what else is in your tree).
