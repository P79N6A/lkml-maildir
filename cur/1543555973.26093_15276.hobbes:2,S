Toby,
Nothing can be done without the full re-write of the driver.
The global request_io_lock is slammed into play way to early and release
way to late.  You will have to suffer with this flaw until the spin of
2.5.  We are talking about a rewrite that is still at least 60 days from
being ready for me to test.
I still have to draft the recovery tools to mirror the disks for the data
lose in the pre-alpha tests.
