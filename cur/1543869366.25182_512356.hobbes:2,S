This has nothing to do with the hypervisor. Even on bare metal (that
machine mode exists up to G7, newer machine always run a hypervisor) you
have to deal with your console device. If this is a 3270 green-screen
you have to do asynchronous i/o. To wait for some room in the console
buffer translates to waiting for the interrupt of a ccw device. The
memory of the machine is unchanged until the interrupt is received.
So yes, ouch!
