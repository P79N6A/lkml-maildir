I don't know how much space i need :-D But why does the device set the 
size to 128MB then?
Also now both controllers where found, but the kernel crashes. It could 
be because the driver was never used with 2 controllers, but to be sure 
  i didn't make something wrong with the ioremap here is my patch.

Simply set size lower :-) Or have i missed something?
Thanks for you help!
