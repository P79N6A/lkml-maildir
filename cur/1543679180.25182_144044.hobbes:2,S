GCC just calls this "UNCONFIRMED" vs. "NEW", which seems to work well. 
A lot of the maintainers don't look at Bugzilla at all, and a lot of
the rest filter out UNCONFIRMED.  A couple of interested (and
dumbfoundingly dedicated) people review and confirm bugs; that's less
possible with the Linux kernel, since bugs often require hardware to
reproduce, but the principle is still sound.
