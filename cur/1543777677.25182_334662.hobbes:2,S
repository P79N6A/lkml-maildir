Tracked it down. (sorry for linewraps)
+#define DEV_NEED_TIMERIRQ	0x0001  /* set the timer irq flag in the irq mask */
+#define DEV_NEED_LINKTIMER	0x0002	/* poll link settings. Relies on the timer 
irq */
+#define DEV_HAS_LARGEDESC	0x0003	/* device supports jumbo frames and needs 
packet format 2 */
My hardware is NEED_TIMERIRQ|NEED_LINKTIMER, however, by this logic, it'll 
also be DEV_HAVE_LARGEDESC, which isn't true.
So, you want this instead:
#define DEV_HAS_LARGEDESC	0x0004
After making that change, all is working fine, but then again, I've never run 
into the hangs you are debugging. I'll follow up in a couple of days time to 
confirm I'm not getting any problems with the new code.
Thanks,
Daniel
