The page reclaim code and the page allocator will aim to keep that amount
of memory free for emergency, IRQ and atomic allocations.

yes, there's some latency involved.  Especially on uniprocessor - if the
CPU is stuck in an interrupt handler refilling a huge network Rx ring then
waking kswapd won't do anything and you will run out of memory.

All I can say is "experiment with it".
It might be useful to renice kswapd so that userspace processes do not
increase its latency.
