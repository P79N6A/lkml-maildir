In the first place, the "no resource" problem is a hardware one.
As far as I understand, it's a buggy (or undocumented) timing requirement
for some revisions.
This problem showed with any kernel, 2.2 or 2.4, until a workaround was
developed.  On a single computer suffering from that problem it showed not on
every boot, but about in 30 percents.  That's why the reports were different.
So, the kernel version is irrelevant to this problem.
