Correct.

Its quite clear.
DESCRIPTION
       This  call copies data between file descriptor and another
       file  descriptor  or  socket.   in_fd  should  be  a  file
       descriptor   opened  for  reading.   out_fd  should  be  a
       descriptor opened for writing or a connected socket.
in_fd must be a file, out_fd can be a file or socket.
