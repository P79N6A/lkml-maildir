I am trying to understand the locking in net/socket.c.
Suppose the system is uniprocessor (no preemption).
Then the various locking routines do nothing:
#define net_family_write_lock() do { } while(0)
#define net_family_write_unlock() do { } while(0)
#define net_family_read_lock() do { } while(0)
#define net_family_read_unlock() do { } while(0)
Look in sock_create:
        net_family_read_lock();
	...
        if ((i = net_families[family]->create(sock, protocol)) < 0)   <= may sleep
	...
        net_family_read_unlock();
The call to create(...) may sleep.  Suppose during this sleep a task is
run that calls sock_unregister:
int sock_unregister(int family)
{
        if (family < 0 || family >= NPROTO)
                return -1;
        net_family_write_lock();
        net_families[family]=NULL;
        net_family_write_unlock();
        return 0;
}
Since net_family_write_lock() is a noop, this succeeds, and returns.
Happy is my task!  It has returned from sock_unregister, so can now,
for example, free memory used for implementing that protocol.  But the
original create(...) call is in the middle of using that protocol.  Unhappy
am I!  I am dead!
What have I missed?
Ciao, Duncan.
