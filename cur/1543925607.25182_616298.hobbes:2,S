I would be very surprised if the reason for these FIXMEs was different 
from the driver submitter not knowing a current address of the author...

I don't have a strong opinion on this one, but my impression was that 
there's generally a move away from using once-used #define's for such 
stuff.

A version number makes sense when there's a maintainer who is 
maintaining and using it to identify different versions of a driver.
But some ancient version number that contains less information than
"the version of this driver shipped with kernel 2.6.xy" doesn't have any 
value.
