get_user is the standard test for bad pointers: If the pointer is bad, 
then the exception handler will prevent an oops.
Could you backport the get_fs()/set_fs() calls around the get_user() 
from 2.5? I assume that ARM needs it to distiguish between kernel and 
user addresses.
On i386, it's possible to skip set_fs() and use __get_user() - but 
that's i386 specific. For example the i386 oops code uses that.
