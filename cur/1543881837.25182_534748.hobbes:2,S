This patch only affects the initial page tables, which should have been
thrown out *way* long ago at this point.
Yet they seem to have stuck around.  This is a very bad thing on many
levels, especially since we should have switched the kernel 1:1 area
over to PSE pages a long time ago.

Touching a non-PSE page which is zero, and quite consistent with being a
remnant from the original page tables.
Methinks this has smoked out a bug in the initial page table setup which
probably has been a performance roadblock for quite some time.
