Unless I'm missing something, that only works if all the users need 
*exactly* the same permissions to all files, which isn't a good assumption.
Example:  Sally is an accountant, Joe and Bill are engineers.
Bill and Joe are working on a project, and Sally is cost control for 
that project - they all need access to the project files.  Bill and Joe 
do not need access to officer salary data, but Sally does.  Bill and Joe 
need access to other projects (not necessarily the same ones), but Sally 
doesn't.  Oops.
