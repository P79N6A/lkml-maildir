Subject: [PATCH] module refcounts for airport driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/5/19/2

This patch takes out the MOD_INC/DEC_USE_COUNT in the airport (Apple
wireless ethernet) driver.  The driver already does SET_MODULE_OWNER
on the netdevice, so the MOD_INC/DEC_USE_COUNT are unnecessary and
just cause warnings.
Please apply.
Thanks,
Paul.
