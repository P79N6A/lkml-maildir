But it doesn't compile if you screw up :)
It is more of a tedious burden, than a maintenance one.  The prototypes
would just sit in a include/linux file.  If someone needs to change a
prototype, they had better change it where it's used!  With the tracing
I do, I like to take some pointer and dereference it.  So it had better
match my prototype.  the printf syntax doesn't cut it for me.  But
that's for my logdev, which is for debugging, and the last thing I need
is to be debugging logdev when I'm debugging something else.
BTW, I looked at the link you showed me, and I think you need a
__mark_check_format in linux/asm-generic/marker.h:
+#define MARK(name, format, args...) \
+	do { \
+		static marker_probe_func *__mark_call_##name = \
+					__mark_empty_function; \
+		volatile static char __marker_enable_##name = 0; \
+		static const struct __mark_marker_c __mark_c_##name \
+			__attribute__((section(".markers.c"))) = \
+			{ #name, &__mark_call_##name, format } ; \
+		static const struct __mark_marker __mark_##name \
+			__attribute__((section(".markers"), unused)) = \
+			{ &__mark_c_##name, &__marker_enable_##name } ; \
+		if (unlikely(__marker_enable_##name)) { \
+			preempt_disable(); \
+			(*__mark_call_##name)(format, ## args); \
+			preempt_enable_no_resched(); \
+		} \
+	} while(0)

It seems to be missing.

Ah, passing more than 4 is probably a waste.  Especially if you can grab
other variables outside of the parameters.
Soon I'll post a new logdev, that doesn't duplicate the macros so bad.
Here's an excerpt:

	}

	}

	}

	}
#define LD_MARK4(label, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4)				\
	{								\

						       typeof(arg2),	\

	}
The prolog helps with this.  With x86_64, I added a SPACER macro to
handle the spacing (.short here).

:)
I don't care for the numbering of the parameters, but it helps with the
type checking that printf can fail with.  But if the printf format is
enough for others, I'm not complaining.  My logdev will be around as
long as I am!
