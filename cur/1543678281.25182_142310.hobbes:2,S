sorry, i can't really get anything in and out of that box.
i've been able to extract some parts of the fsck log, they look like this:
vpf-10680: The file [2406 26400] has the wrong block count in the 
StatData (8), should be (1)
vpf-10680: The file [2406 49744] has the wrong block count in the 
StatData (8), should be (1)

it tells me it can fix it with the --fixable option, done that a couple 
of times, new errors after that.
i can't send you my kernel config, because the kernel tree was one of 
the first things that got eaten.... the entire tree ended up in 
lost+found all in pieces. unfortunately i deleted it. :(
it's an smp box with 2 p3s, intel bx chipset, aic7xxx scsi, ide and scsi 
compiled into the kernel, reiserfs too. tagged queuing enabled, ignore 
word validation bits enabled, use dma by default enabled. it has 3 scsi 
discs, 2 of which are striped, and one ide which has one huge partition 
of 175G. the scsi discs are 4, 9 and 9 gig.
no atapi devices, only a scsi cdrom and a burner.
the box is so f&%$ed up, when i try to cat a logfile i get:
vpf-10640: the on-disk and the correct bitmaps differs.
nothing else.

/var is totally FUBAR, the system won't boot into my fallback kernel. i 
don't have a second machine around to compile another kernel on... sorry.
i might be able to put the ide disk into another box tomorrow and try 
another reiserfsck with proper logging, but i have no place to check the 
scsi disks. i'll keep you posted when i get it done.
best,
jörn
