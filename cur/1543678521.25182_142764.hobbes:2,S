I'll say! Looks almost like it JMPed to a null pointer or something.

I think it unlikely to be RAM problems given that the problem happened
shortly after upgrading to 2.4.21; this was about half a day after I
rebooted it because it threw a pile of never-seen-again, un-syslogged
SCSI abort errors at me (sym53c875); and *that* was a few minutes after
I rebooted into 2.4.21 for the first time.
All my other boxes love 2.4.21, but this one dislikes it. (Of course it
has to be my second-most-critical server... ah well, the NFS problems
in 2.4.20 bit my most critical server and my home directory both, so
I guess this is less unpleasant.)

Did that last night; no problems reported. (Not really surprising.)

That's my weirdly broken syslog config. I've never got around to fixing
it; it only happens with kernel messages and I don't get all that many
of those.
