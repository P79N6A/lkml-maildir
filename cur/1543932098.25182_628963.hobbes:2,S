Looks like the kernel is eating all the resources needed.

32bit kernel, 16GB of RAM. 
No suprise I'm afraid. Handling 16GB on a 32bit kernel, which has to
manage it all through a small addressible memory window is right on the
limit of what the standard kernel will handle (8GB is probably as high as
I would go). The no overcommit code ensures that user space doesn't
overcommit, but the kernel can get itself short of low memory resources
on a big box with 32bit kernels very easily. (In 64bit mode the CPU can
address all the memory directly so the problem vanishes).
You will *probably* get stable 16GB with the vendor tuned enterprise
kernels (RHEL, CentOS etc), or run a 64bit kernel and then the kernel
isn't trying the software equivalent of managing a filing cabinet through
the keyhole.
