Deadline will always be the best choice for OLTP workloads.  Or CFQ - it
should perform the same.
All this workload does is seeks all over the disk doing teeny synchronous
I/O's.  It is the worst-case for AS.
What we are trying to do at present is to make AS not _too_ bad for these
workloads so that people with mixed workloads or who are not familiar with
kernel arcanery don't accidentally end up with something which is
significantly slower than it should be.
It is an interesting test case.
