There aren't any NFS_MNT flags, so I presume you mean NFS_MOUNT flags.  As I
understood Trond, it's not permitted to add new such flags except in really
special circumstances as these are part of the mount syscall interface.  I
took this to mean that I should record the option elsewhere than in
server->flags.
