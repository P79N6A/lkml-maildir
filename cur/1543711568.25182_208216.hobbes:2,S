No. fixmap mappings are global - identical for all processes and all 
cpus. Therefore it's not necessary to flush them during a task switch. 
But that's just an optimization, not a mandatory feature:
On x86 it's possible to mark page table entries as global. Global 
entries are not flushed by the normal tlb flush command, this gives a 
slighly better performance. If your architecture doesn't support that, 
then you can just flush everything during a task switch. I think the 
support for global entries was added for the Pentium cpus - 80486 cpus 
flush the whole tlb cache during a task switch.
