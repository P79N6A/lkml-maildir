Hi all!
I've just had a brand new Canon CanoScan N676U. I hope it works great as it
is not yet supported by Sane. That's why I volunteer to add support for this
device in Sane.
Could someone please point me to documents / source code / URLs / RFC /
whatever is of interest to start coding a new backend for sane and to
understand USB programming (kernel Guys, ideas?) ?
As I've got a full-time job during the day, I won't be very fast at coding,
but if I don't do it, I'll never be able to use my scanner (Woops, no windows
at home!).
Of course, if someone allready has some code,I'm ready to test it on my
device, as well as get & tweak it.
TIA,
Yann.
