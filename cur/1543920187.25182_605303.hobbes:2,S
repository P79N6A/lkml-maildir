Low-level networking drivers suggest a default interface name (per
interface or as a template like eth%d into which the networking core
inserts a lowest spare number).  Userspace can rename interfaces, but
nevertheless it's nice to have different default kernel names for
ethernet, wlan etc..
Could low-level SCSI drivers provide similar name templates which give a
hint on the transport involved?  It's a bit more difficult as with
networking interfaces though because
  - SCSI devices can have sd, sr, st, osst, ch, sg interfaces,
  - SCSI device files share a namespace with all other device files.
E.g.
/dev/sd-ide-b	- second IDE HDD,
/dev/sd-iscsi-e	- fifth iSCSI direct access device,
/dev/sr-sata-0	- first SATA CD-ROM,
/dev/sr-usb-0	- a USB CD-ROM,
/dev/st-fw-0	- a FireWire tape drive,
/dev/sda	- a device whose transport driver didn't propose a name
Of course the really interesting names will still be provided by
udev-generated symlinks.
