Of course there are things stopping one from doing this (aside from the
kernel not allowing this in the moment at all since the highest fd
number is limited severely):
- - this scheme would only be use if it would be possible to have
completely random descriptor values.  But what has been said here
already is that this is too costly.  Hence the approach to randomize
only the base value.
- - there are two interface to use: open + fcntl.  This is racy.  And
don't tell me this doesn't matter.
