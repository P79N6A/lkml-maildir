Hi,
I've sent some messages about using O_DIRECT to read files, but I
suppose that is not possible using 2.4 kernel and ext2. So I was
wondering which other alternatives I have to bypass the buffer cache of
the kernel. One option would be create a raw device on top of my disk
partition, but in this case I would have to learn how to map a logical
file name (/var/tmp/myfile) to a set of block disks. Is there any other
solution? Can I disable buffer caches or at least limit their memory
utilization?
Thanks,
Bruno.
