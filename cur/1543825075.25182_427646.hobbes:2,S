Thanks, but I was looking more into the code, and I'm wondering...
Does this machine have "irqfixup" or "irqpoll" set in the kernel command
line?
I think that -rt doesn't support it yet.  That is, it can call a handler
from interrupt context, which should have been a thread.
Let me know if that was the case.
