Hi Richard,
Thanks for these perf. figures!

Ok. Let's drop unsafe version. This will also do away will that Makefile debris.

I suspect this is mainly due to replacement of COPY4() and open coded
byte-by-byte copying with memcpy() calls. I will rollback these
particular changes, remove unsafe version and will see again. I have
retained all other code as-is.
I will also try adding benchmarking code to my (GPL) 'compress-test'
module (same which I sent to Bret). Though it's pretty basic module
but should be sufficient to give required perf. figures.
