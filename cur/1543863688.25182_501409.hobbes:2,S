That looked like a lot of changes to the tty layer.  I think going up
sounds better.  Finding the bug fix and backporting it would be
preferable of course.

Well I can certainly compare the code between those versions, and I have
a 2.6.18 kernel I could try out too.

Yes, I run Debian.  rpm has very little interest.  I can convert it
though.

I did that.

I am using the GPIO lines too, and didn't want to mess with the 8250
driver (since I use that for a serial console on a 16550 UART), plus
being able to use the 64byte fifo rather than 16byte 16550 mode fifo
seems nicer.  I had to take the exar out of the 8250 driver to make it
not take control of it (although now the eeprom has been added to the
board so it no longer appears as a generic exar chip).
Thanks for the suggestions though.  Gives me a few things to try.
