This is not AMD specific - the core USB code is broken in the event of
that control timeout occuring. I see the same hang on an Intel ICH6M
platform.
I've done a quick review of the semaphores and didn't see an obvious
cause although I did find a glaring error on a different unused path.
(Oh and although it isn't fixed - that isnt how busses pluralises either
)
