Hi all,
I have a very long running CPU bound process running.  It starts
at boot time.  I am running on a SMP dual Pentium II 350 and under
2.2.0 pre 4 (I think, my be pre 7) this process would cause top
to report 99.9% user time and the CPU time usage of this process
would keep pace with total uptime over several hours i.e. it just
runa on one CPU and abosorbed all its time (this is what I would
expect).
Under 2.2.1, top reports 49.8% user time and the processes CPU time
run as at (very close to) half the uptime.
Here is is:
 1:41pm  up 47 min,  2 users,  load average: 1.00, 1.00, 0.95
22 processes: 20 sleeping, 2 running, 0 zombie, 0 stopped
CPU states: 49.6% user,  1.0% system,  0.0% nice, 49.3% idle
Mem:  128104K av,  60572K used,  67532K free,   9436K shrd,  24100K buff
Swap: 124988K av,      0K used, 124988K free                 17640K cached
  PID USER     PRI  NI  SIZE  RSS SHARE STAT  LIB %CPU %MEM   TIME COMMAND

I have nothing else of significance running.
Any clues, have I missed something?
Debian 2.1 (slink) with some of unstable (potato)
Linux version 2.2.1 (root@acacia) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) #1 SMP Thu Feb 4 22:45:13 EST 1999
procps 1.9.0
Any more information required?
Cheers,
Stephen
