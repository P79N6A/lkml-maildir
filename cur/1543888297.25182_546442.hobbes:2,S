When using "static inline", the compiler may ignore the inline keyword 
(it's just a hint), and leave the function as a standalone function.
When CONFIG_FORCED_INLINING is active, and it is by default, inline is 
always substituted by __always_inline, to be on the safe side. Some code 
needs to be always inline; but not all code has been checked whether it 
is safe to go from __always_inline to inline.
