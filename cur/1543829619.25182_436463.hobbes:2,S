I agree that i386 CONFIG_NUMA is only ment to boot on small subset of
hw but there is litte motivation to boot a numa kernel on a non-numa
box.  I am supprised that no one has enabled i386 AMD NUMA (the one
numa box that regular people have access to).

Current Summit HW  (x460) dosen't use/have a cyclone.  There are
patches submitted to this list to support it's i386 NUMA boot.
Thanks,
