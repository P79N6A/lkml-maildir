Thanks to Nicholas Wourms and a few others, it has been confirmed that
I am, in fact, an idiot (for some, there was never any doubt...).
Somewhere along the way the message bodies stored in MARC got assigned a
64kb max size.  So messages were indeed truncated at 65,535 bytes.
That's fixed.  Out of 3.1 million mails MARC got in 2002, 7,184 had been
silently truncated.  I've identified and fixed from backups the majority
of those (and 2001 as well); there are still some 1,387 mails from 2002
which appear truncated.  So we're down from 0.23% bad data to 0.04%.  I
believe the majority of those are from bulk inserts I've done of new
lists added this year, so lists like linux-kernel which we've carried
forever should be at or near 100%.  And of course, all new incoming mail
should be fine, up to about 1MB.
So.  *Now* please let me know if you find any mails to linux-kernel or
others that appear to have been truncated or otherwise damaged. ;)
Thanks,
Hank Leininger <hlein@progressive-comp.com>
