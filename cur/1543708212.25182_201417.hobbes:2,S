Thanks for your reply.  What option do I have to enable exactly? 
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP? Anything else required? Also, how do I get 
access to the results of the debugging? I mean, it's really a hard 
crash, no messages visible (that is, when running X), no logging to 
syslog, etc.
Also - can this possibly be related to the "growisofs problem with 
2.6.3" that was discussed at various places (and a patch was posted too) 
- I have this problem, too, since the upgrade to 2.6.3. Just in case you 
havent followed the discussion, here are two links:

Right now I can't do tests, since I'm away from home, and if I trigger a 
crash from remote I'm in trouble since I still need the machine; but I'm 
willing to test patches as soon as I'm back.
bye,
Tillmann
