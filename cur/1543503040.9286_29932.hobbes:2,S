Uhm, yeah, could be. But the same thing occurs for Linux<->AIX too...
Sure, the SunOS-patch fixed the SunOS<->Linux problem for us (we had it
too), but we're still experiencing it with AIX. In my humble opinion there
is something fishy with the Linux NFS if it triggers a bug in both AIX and
SunOS, that no other NFS-implementation that we know of triggers...
Mail me for more info, if needed on setup, AIX-version etc.
