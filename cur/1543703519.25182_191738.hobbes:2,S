Nope, the CPU is clocked per spec.  I have an issue with this 
motherboard since I got it, half the time when I reboot it blurps and 
simply won't boot with a high-low warble.  I have to turn the machine 
off for about 30 minutes or drain the cmos and reset everything.
I'm actually running the RAM a little slow.
