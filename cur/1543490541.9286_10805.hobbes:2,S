When I installed Red Hat on one of my systems, I noticed something
strange in /etc/ppp/options. It was a single line with a single word
which I don't remember. I deleted it, left nothing in the file
and it works fine (I am using it for this message). This is the
only system that I have that used a standard distribution. It
is now used as my ppp host/router for my LAN at home  to my LAN
at work with all the bells and whistles (proxy arp, subnet routing, etc).
Cheers,
