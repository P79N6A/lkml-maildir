comment from userspace:
I'm going to have to side with Linus here despite my desire to see LKCD merged.
However, we need to show him the money. This means:
	* making sure that the patches are kept up to date
	* keep the LKCD patches in the list/community spotlight in a positive
		manner ("please test this!", or  "please use this when
		looking for help debugging a system problem"). Perhaps
		a 2.5.x-lkcd bk tree or something like that.
	* make documentation/HOWTO's available for folks so that
		they'll know how to generate a crashdump
		and run a some utilities against it to generate
		a synopsis which can be submitted for debugging
	* most important: squash a whole lot of bugs with
		said dumps!
If it becomes apparent through empirical data that crash dumps are a useful
tool, I'm sure that Linus will become far more amenable. Until then, lets let
him handle all of his other work which needs to get done.
