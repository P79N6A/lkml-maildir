 I have a BIG BIG problem with 2.3.9-pre2:
 I just did a short compile test to discover the kernel's stability
 which is not to bad but a bit later I tried to use the fresh compiled 
 MESA libs which were corrupted. So I shut down properly and did a
 reboot with a more stable kernel to find out what's going wrong. 
 It seems like linux didn't put the complete lib onto disk. I compared
 it with a new compile and saw that it is nearly the same but with
 several few KB holes in it. 
 I'll try the same again as soon as pre-3 is installed and we'll see...
Servus,
       Daniel
