Right.  The core problem was there was not enough context to see
what the dependency was from the comment.  Having to read
another comment to understand the comment you are reading
usually breaks after a while.
Now that we have git the problem is less severe because we
can look in the history and see what the comment meant when
it was written but that is still a hassle.
