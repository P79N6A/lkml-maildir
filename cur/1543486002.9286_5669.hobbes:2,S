In Linux, ISA Plug & Play capabilities are handled in userspace by the
"isapnptools".  A kernel device driver can ignore PnP issues.  Just load
yourself as a driver, and either autoprobe or accept I/O, IRQ, DMA settings
configured on the modprobe/insmod commandline.
(The only complication that this generates is that your driver must be
a loadable module)
