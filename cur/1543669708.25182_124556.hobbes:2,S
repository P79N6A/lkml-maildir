Hi
Thanks for all the feedback I've gotten from people.
It seems the interactivity patch wasn't worth the effort, confirming my 
suspicions - which is why I resisted posting it in the first place.
I've made ck4 available again on my website.
I've updated the split out patches to a pre-ck6 state without the 
interactivity patches.
Rmap15f is now available also.

P.S. My new motto - if it sucks, let me know.
