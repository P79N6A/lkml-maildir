Hello out there,
I have two Athlon MP's 2600+ mounted on a MSI K7D-Master-L with the famous 
AMD-768 (Opus) chipset (latest BIOS 1.82).
Actually I'm using debian's 'woody' distribution with the kernel 2.4.22-pre8, 
glibc 2.2.5 and gcc 2.95.4.
I have problems with the IDE support:
On the hardisk (Maxtor 6Y120L0 - 120GB) there is a 1.4 GB file, I want to 
copy. But when I try this, the system stops with the error message:
attempt to access beyond end of device
03:09: rw=0, want=976094472, limit=109948828
and I have to push the reset button.
When I switch DMA off by using 'hdparm -d0' everthing works fine, but the 
hole copy-process takes about 8 minutes!
Taking a look at 'lspci' shows the following:
# lspci
00:00.0 Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD]: Unknown device 700c (rev 
11)
00:01.0 PCI bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD]: Unknown device 700d

00:07.1 IDE interface: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD]: Unknown device 7441 (rev 
04)
00:07.3 Bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD]: Unknown device 7443 (rev 03)
00:07.5 Multimedia audio controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD]: Unknown 
device 7445 (rev 03)
00:10.0 PCI bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD]: Unknown device 7448 (rev 05)
01:05.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon VE QY

(rev 07)
02:09.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82557 [Ethernet Pro 100] (rev 10)
So, the AMD is 'unknown', although 'dmesg' tells:

Are there any solutions or workarounds to fix these problems?
Do I have to upgrade the glibc or any other system components?
Does this problem affect any inter-CPU processes like OpenMP?
Do I have to change the motherboard? Which mobo's are said to be reliable?
Kindest regards,
Heimo Truhetz
