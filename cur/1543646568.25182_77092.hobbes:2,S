Larry,
a simple question: does the BK license allow the Rational kernel
developers to use BK (to eg. check out Linus' tree) when working on kernel
support for ClearCase?
ie. is all kernel development activity against your license as long as the
activity is a competitor of yours?
perhaps you should restrict the BK license's wording to closed-source
'competitors' only - after all your own explanation in:
	bk help openlogging
says that for version-control software there exists no sustainable
open-source based business-model, so they cannot be any viable competitors
of yours.
