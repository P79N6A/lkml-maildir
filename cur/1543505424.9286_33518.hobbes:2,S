Well fdisk and mkfs work for everything else in the universe so...

To the right block on the disk ?

Ok it might be cached.

Ok. Including block numbers ?

So you overwrote it - that tends to indicate your disk block mapping is
going
wrong.

See if a partition just in the first 1Gig of the disk works - dont touch
anything else. If so you may well have a 32/64bit issue.
Also open the /dev/sda raw and write zero to each block on the disk. Now
go through each block making sure that it is zero on read and write the
block
number to it. Finally go through each block and read the block number back
to check it is there, then write zero.
If that bit survives it may be your partition handling code not your low
level code that is playing up.
