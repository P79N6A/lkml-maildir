No, in 2.4 fdatasync does the right thing and skips the inode flush if
only the timestamps have changed.

fdatasync is required to sync more than just the data: it has to sync
the inode too if any fields other than the timestamps have changed.
So, for appending to files or writing new files from scratch, fsync ==
fdatasync (because each write also changes the inode size).  Only for
updating existing files in place does fdatasync behave differently.

2.4's O_SYNC actually does a fdatasync internally.  This is also the
default behaviour of HPUX, which requires you to set a sysctl variable
if you want O_SYNC to flush timestamp changes to disk.
Cheers,
