Linus, Linus, how can you say something so naive?
I need not tell you that one user without problems does not imply
that nobody will have problems.
A few people reported lost filesystems. Many more reported mild
filesystem damage. And now you also report mild filesystem damage.
FUD? Fear? Yes, the fear is justified for whoever does not have backups.
Uncertainty? Yes, when the filesystem is damaged again, it is not quite
clear what causes it. Doubt? Yes, many people doubt whether they can
afford to run 2.5.recent.
This evening I ran vanilla 2.5.29 and was rewarded with mild filesystem damage.
91 files in /lost+found. Nothing. A few kernel versions ago it was three
orders of magnitude worse.
IDE? 2.4.17 and 2.5.27+Jens are stable for me in ordinary use.
IRQ? Quite possible.
My third candidate is USB. Systems without USB are clearly more stable.
