Subject: Adding checkpointing API to Linux kernel

I like your comments, and am forwarding them to the linux-kernel mailing
list.
I'm the maintainer of GNU Queue, a distributed batch and interactive job
load-balancing system. The homepage for GNU Queue is
http://bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu/~wkrebs/queue.html
 (frequently updated) and
http://www.gnu.org/software/queue
 (official).
Andy Glew writes about the need for an NT-like (gasp!) API in the
GNU/Linux that would all trapping of OS system calls without recompiling
code. (For use in checkpoint migration facilities, which we are
considering adding to GNU Queue.) Recompilation is necessary to use
these facilities with commercial apps. The scary thing is it appears to
be easier in NT than in GNU/Linux (see Andy's comments). Given NT's
other "features" (lack of true simultaneous multiuser capaibilities), it
would see that GNU/Linux and UNIX are otherwise ideal systems for this
type of distributed application, so this is not a good thing, IMHO.
Could anyone develop such an API?
