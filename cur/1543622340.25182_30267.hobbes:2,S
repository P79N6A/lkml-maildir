Hi, lkml readers.
After one other session of patch messing, here is rc4-jam2. Main update
is vm-25 -> vm-27 from Andrea. Get it as usual at:
http://giga.cps.unizar.es/~magallon/linux/kernel/2.4.18-rc4-jam2/
and as not so usual at:
http://giga.cps.unizar.es/~magallon/linux/kernel/2.4.18-rc4-jam2.tar.gz
I have reordered the patches to make easier to test cleanly subsystems:
- 0* is VM update. It applies cleanly (and after a compiler.h addendum,
  builds cleanly) on 18-rc4, for people that only want to test AA-vm
  vs RMAP-vm (hint, hint...)
- 1* are tiny smp enhancements, that I think are safe.
- 2* are O1 scheduler and low-latency
- 3* are SCSI-IDE updates.
- 5* mixed things...
- 6* sensors
- 7* bproc
- 8* miscelanea
Fore serious tests, I would not apply anything >=50, unless you are
interested on something there.
Good luck. My box lives (see signature).
