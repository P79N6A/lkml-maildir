It's probably best all-round.
But another simpler way is to just set a global "am_suspended" bool
in the _suspend() code, and clear it again in the _resume() code,
and check it in the irq handler() code.
And the test for 0xffffffff (my simple patch) is probably good
to have regardless inside the irq handler().
