Subject: [PATCH] saa7134: fix thread shutdown handling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/21/274

 This patch changes the test for the thread pid from >= 0 to > 0.
 When the saa8134 driver initialization fails after a certain point,
 it goes through the complete shutdown process for the driver. Part
 of shutting it down includes tearing down the thread for tv audio.
 The test for tearing down the thread tests for >= 0. Since the dev
 structure is kzalloc'd, the test will always be true if we haven't
 tried to start the thread yet. We end up waiting on pid 0 to complete,
 which will never happen, so we lock up.
 This bug was observed in Novell Bugzilla 284718, when request_irq()
 failed.
