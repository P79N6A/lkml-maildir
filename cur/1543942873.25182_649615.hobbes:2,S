we should more seriously investigate kernel thread scalability for 
another reason as well: besides -rt, any generic async IO facility we 
pick up will likely heavily rely on them. Kernel thread scheduling is 
quite a bit lighter than user task scheduling [no TLB flushes, etc.] - 
and if it is still not good enough we could probably accelerate them 
some more. (and everyone will benefit) irq-context softirqs on the other 
hand are quite rigid and bring in many atomicity assumptions so they are 
not as natural to program for.
