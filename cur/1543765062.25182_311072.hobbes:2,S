OK, I'm now at the stage where I can kick off that fsx test on a kernel
without your leak fix, kill it, umount and get
Whoops: found 43 unfreeable buffers still on the superblock debug list
for sb 00000100296b2d48.  Tracing one...
buffer trace for buffer at 0x000001003edaa9c8 (I am CPU 0)

with a trace pointing to journal_unmap_buffer().  I'll try with the fix
in place to see if there are any other cases showing up with the same
