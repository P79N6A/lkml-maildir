I'm trying to set up a pivot_root hack to do some things, switch root,
and then unmount the original root.  However, the unmount fails
because ksoftirqd/0, events/0, kblockd/0 and aio/0 have /dev/console
opened.  Why are they doing this?  Can it be prevented?  This happens
when using kernel 2.6.3 (2.6.4 is reportedly broken on Alpha).  It
works with a 2.4 kernel using the same script.  Does anyone have a
hint?
