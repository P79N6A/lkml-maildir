There's no process needed. The only thing needed is to treat the Linux 
implementation as the reference design, documentation and specification. 
Treat it as we treat the Linux system calls. We promise not to change 
them. There's no "process" for that either, other than our promise, our 
taste and our best efforts - plus the backing of all distributions and 
the threat of a few million users who start yelling (or worse) if we 
break it ;)
