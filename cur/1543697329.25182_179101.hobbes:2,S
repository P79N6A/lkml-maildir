Hi,
Iam talking about Red Hat Linux 8.0 3.2-7
  Linux version 2.4.18-14.
I registered a post route hook with
nf_register_hook(), and insmoded it,then I wrote a
small program to send  broadcast packets, then I
observed that pre route hook is getting hit twice.
One more thing I observed that if we send it to Linux
stack (by saying NF_ACCEPT)and in ethereal I observed
only one packet(duplicate packet is not appearing).
What could be the reason in hitting pre route hook
twice, and how stack is distinguishing the duplicate
packet.
Thanks
Srinivas
