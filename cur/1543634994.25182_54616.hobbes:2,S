Hi,
I've posted this a couple of times already to linuxppc-dev and to the
linux-usb devel list, without any results.
Here are the details:
tested with iBook dual-USB 2001 (500 MHz) and iMac g3 400 (summer 2000)
kernels ranging from 2.4.7 to 2.4.19-pre10
LaCie USB 20G hard-drive, 0x59f/0xa601 ID (it's in the unusual_devs.h)
Some people got it to work it seems:
http://www.qbik.ch/usb/devices/showdev.php?id=68
Here's the log when I plug the device in:
Jun 18 21:04:26 dozo kernel: hub.c: USB new device connect on bus1/1,

and the debug messages from the usb-storage module:

This is plugging and unplugging the device. The usb-storage module is
removable. But the socket it was plugged in is unusable, I have to
reboot to be able to use it again.
Did anybody got this drive to work on an OHCI controller or even better,
on a PPC ?
Cheers
PS: CC me as I'm not on the list.
