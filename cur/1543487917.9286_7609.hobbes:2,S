Subject: announce (2.2.1, i386, experimental): nanokernel (PPSkit-0.6) snapshot #4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hello,
I used the time to fix a few remaining bugs in the nanokernel. Maybe 
the only remaining things are "features".
Specifically, I added binary compatibility to adjtime() [read my 
other message about adjtime() in general], and I fixed some scaling 
problems where old applications still expect microseconds. Most 
notably, maybe, time doesn't run backwards occasionally any longer ;-)
Old applications will still compile, unless they are very Linux 
specific, because the "#define NANO" magic is implemented now [I 
don't like it, but that's the obvious standard]. Thus kernel parts 
#including <linux/timex.h> need to #define NANO before. Ugly, but 
true.
I made tests with ntpd 4.0.91f and xntpd3-5.93, and results were 
equally good/bad. It's your turn now! [The next snapshot will most 
likely have clock_getres() from POSIX.4, because the current 
resolution of 1ns on my Pentium-100 is simply a lie...]
Regards,
Ulrich Windl
