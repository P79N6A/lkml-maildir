I believe this was done so that we could quickly work out the pci
bus/device/function inside read/write[bwl].  We needed that for coping
with the "Enhanced Error Handling" (EEH) stuff on pSeries machines.
I think we used to stuff the pci bus/dev/fn in the high bits and then
change the top 4 bits to make quite clear that it wasn't a valid
pointer.  These days we don't put the pci bus/dev/fn in the high bits
and we could certainly get rid of the IO_TOKEN_TO_ADDR games.
This stuff predates Ben's involvement in ppc64 by a long way, and was
put in before Anton or I had much influence.  We'll clean it up.
Paul.
