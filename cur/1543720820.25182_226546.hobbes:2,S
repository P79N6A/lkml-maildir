They are genuine AMD Athlon 1900 MPs (never over-clocked) on a Giga-byte
7DPXDW-P.  The only time these errors seem to occur is when the system
is under heavy disk activity.  Could there be a bug with the APIC timer?
This motherboard has two ide-controllers on board.  I've noticed in the
log:
Enabling APIC mode:  Flat.  Using 1 I/O APICs
Is this correct, or should it be 2 I/O APICs?
I'm really fishing for answers.  I'd like to know if there really is
something wrong with my system (although it still seems rock stable) or
is this possible a kernel bug?
I'm currently using 2.6.7-rc3 compiled with gcc 3.4.0.
Thanks,
Steve

Is this a Dual AMD Platform? If yes, are this real MPs or just modded 
XPs? I've had this kind of error for years on a dual AMD with modded XPs
on a Tyan 2460 - until now, no processor broke down. The APIC is very 
picky on this board, judging different posts from the internet.
