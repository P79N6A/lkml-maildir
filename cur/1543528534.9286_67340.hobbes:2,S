I had all kind of troubles with this drive.  When I created a linux
partition much greater than
8 gybtes, it would need to fsck and would find errors every time I booted.
Also, I could not
get lilo to boot properly with these drives, but I think that was a
combination of my BIOS and
the drive.  There were quite a few different versions of the geometry
floating around between
the BIOS, linux, DOS, and lilo.
Finally I got a SCSI drive and I boot from the SCSI.  I have added
hda=4980,255,634 hdb=4980,255,63
to my kernel command line (via lilo).  By forcing this geometry, I am now
able to partition the
entire disk as a single partition and use it that way.  I also have had two
20 GByte partitoins as well and
they work great too.
The SCSI works so much faster though that I bought a second SCSI and just
use the two
SCSI drives now :)
Thanks
