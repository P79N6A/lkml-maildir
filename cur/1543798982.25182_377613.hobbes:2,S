First you gotta understand that I am not arguing to take away the 4K  
stacks - I am arguing about keeping both options and defaulting to 4K.
How do you determine how much stack space a piece of code is going to  
need without knowing what functionality it needs to build? There  
might be deeply nested, long call chains etc. which certain types of  
functionality might warrant. How do you prove "4K otta be enough  
stack for everyone doing everything", on what basis? (Reminds me of  
old DOS days and the famous statement relating to 640K)

Yeah, compare that same thing to FORCING 4K stacks - it sounds as  
illogical as the above statement.
No one is answering what are we gaining from removing the 8K stack  
"_option_" - few bytes of code size, reason to not fix the VM, for  
fun, for screwing over? Why not let people choose 8K if they need it?
