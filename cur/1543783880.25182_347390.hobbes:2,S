Hello together,
with my machine, an
"hdparm -I /dev/dvdrecorder" leads to the output:
/dev/dvdrecorder:
 HDIO_DRIVE_CMD(identify) failed: Input/output error
The kernel tells me:
[4296893.262000] hdd: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
[4296893.262000] hdd: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { AbortedCommand }
[4296893.262000] ide: failed opcode was: 0xec
This happens with 2.6.12 and 2.6.13. DMA works fine, though. And burning 
CDs/DVDs seems to work fine, too.
The same hdparm command to a "normal" CD or DVD ROM drive (no writer) does not 
produces any error messages, though.
So what does this strange opcode do, and why does it fail in the latest 
kernels?
/dev/dvdrecorder is a Plextor 708A, the error also occurs with a Plextor 716A.
Best regards
Oliver
