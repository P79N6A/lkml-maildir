Yes. Please don't play with the kernel. Their are alot of nice programs
out their for this. Xinetd, tcpwrappers etc. If you really want to make
your site secure I recommand the new book out "Maximum Linux Security: A
Hacker's Guide to Protecting Your Linux Server and Workstation" by
SAM. Its a really good book.
