I contacted the manufacturer, and they provided me with a firmware upgrade tool
and the firmware version CDVL(as opposed to C5VL). It seems they fixed the
problem with their firmware in the latest version.
I'm not sure whether or not it is worth fixing the 2.6.x kernels to support the
broken firmware, as they seem to offer the upgrade to all customers anyway.
