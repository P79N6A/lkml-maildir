Great.  Then solve the problem after you _know_ there is a problem.
Several people have told you that they don't like your approach.  That
should be enough for you to have to justify your changes with real 
applications which have been proven to be hitting this problem.  That
should be trivial, according to you, because you have repeatedly come
up with long arguments as to why it must be true.  Fine.  Show that it
is true before you tinker with the scheduler.  It's too important 
to be changed because you think there might be a problem.  Don't you
agree?
: I also think it's a bit unfair to label people who agree with me
: as "pseudo-RT friends". 
Come on Richard, you're just being defensive.  You seem to represent
a set of people who don't want RT but they want some other thing which
you call "soft-RT".  I, and others with more experience in this area,
question the validity of any sort of real time features in a multi user,
time sharing system.  We happen to believe that the two disciplines are
mutually exclusive.  I don't know what you want me to call your friends,
but they seem to like this strange thing you call "soft-RT".  Since that
is not considered real time by _any_ textbook or _any_ credible published
paper, I'm feel completely justified in calling it "pseudo-RT".  So you
have these friends, they like your ideas, your ideas are focussed on 
pseudo-RT, so I called them your pseudo-RT friends.  What's the problem?

: Ignoring the fact that my changes had a net benefit for the general

: The best I can do in response is ask that someone out there with a
: soft-RT Linux application steps forward if they're having timing
: problems and we can see if it's due to the scheduler.
Great, that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do.  I'd like to exclude
from that set of people your friends, because you are clearly the technical
lead for your friends so their independence is clearly in question.  I'd
like to know if there is someone else who can demonstrate a need for the
changes you want to make to the scheduler.  If nothing else, maybe I'll
learn something.
