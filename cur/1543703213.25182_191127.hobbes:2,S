Hi Jürgen,
You could take a look at laptop-mode. This a patch that defers disk writes, so that your disks can 
remain spun down for longer than just a couple of seconds. I've actually done the port of this patch 
to Linux 2.6 because I wanted to achieve exactly what you want to achieve. Be aware though that most 
HDs have a VERY LIMITED amount of spinups/spindowns in them, about 50K for most desktop drives 
(which translates to about once every two hours over a 6-year lifetime). This is why I've actually 
abandoned my original goal -- I couldn't get my spindown frequency below about twice per hour, so 
that would kill my drives. If you care for your drives and your data, make ABSOLUTELY SURE that your 
drive doesn't spin up more than once every two hours on average. And if you can't make that happen, 
don't do it, find a quiet drive+case+fan+etc instead. Good luck!
