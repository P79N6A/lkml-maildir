Hi,
   Could someone please bring me up to date on where we stand with the
development of the new scheduler.  I have been away for a few weeks, I am
tring to catch up, but am having a hard time.  I thought I'd  cut to the
chase and just ask.
So, I see 2.4.18 arrived, but I don't see a patch for the scheduler for
this kernel.  I can't see that it was merged in...so whats the deal..?
Ok, I guess, repeat same question for 2.5x....
Bill
