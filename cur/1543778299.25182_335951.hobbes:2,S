/dev/cdrom is a link to the proper device, if that link is not
on the initrd /dev/cdrom won't work.
I previously had some statically linked linuxrc C code (I don't
have the code anymore- it was a work-for-hire), that scanned
the various locations that the cd could be (/dev/hd[abcd...])
and looked for specific files that it expected to be on the
cd, once it found it it setup real-root-dev to be proper for
that device.
This work rather nicely in situations where the location of
the cd drive was not the same from one machine to another,
and was rather simple to write.
