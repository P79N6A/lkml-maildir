There appears to be some fairly clear duplication between my clocksource
tree and this release of high resolution timers. Not to mention that we
both submitted our tree's to Andrew within days . 
To lessen Andrews burden it would be wise to integrate the two trees
prior to anything going into -mm .. It makes sense to eliminate this
kind of duplication since it just results in wasted effort. With the
benefit that the merge would likely result in a stronger patch set over
all.
