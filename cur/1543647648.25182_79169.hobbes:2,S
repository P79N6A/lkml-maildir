Some people on #lartc were wondering about the use of a route cache if there
is only one route. It was reported that a single default route on a system
that talks to many destinations would lead to a huge route cache, which is
probably not more efficient than looking up the simple route.
Would this 'small efficient flow cache' also solve this problem?
Or is this problem a figment of people's imaginations?

I know a lot of people are hoping that you make the feature freeze. As said
before, if there is any help you need, just yell.
