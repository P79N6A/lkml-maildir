A primitive form of gc, but yes, in a way.

} User "sam" is a trusting soul, and gives me permission to read files
} in her "shared" directory.  After a while we do more work together,
} and the "shared" directory gets moved into my directory.

} open, the kernel will helpfully garbage-collect them for her.
} 
} Great! (Extrapolate to root if you're not too bored already)

"sam" would still have a reference to her stuff, so the gc would not
collect that garbage, one would think.

} Make sure it can handle infinitely nested circular references like the

Traditional gc's used with programs have to deal with really convoluted
things too...
