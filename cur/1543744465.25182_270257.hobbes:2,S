Yuck, don't do that, just use the Linux RAID tools and mirror your
data.

Use the 'md' raid modules instead.  You can divide the disk(s) into
multiple volumes, then mirror/stripe your data across that instead.
If a disk fails, you're toast if you haven't got data on another
disk.
If it's the media that's possibly flaky, then partitioning into
multiple areas and using 'md' to RAID across partitions might help.
Performance will suck though.  
If the underlying media is flaky, then you're going to have lots and
lots of problems.
