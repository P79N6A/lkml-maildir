I started something like this a few months ago, I was at the point to boot
a usermode kernel till the fsck, which failed. Currently I have no time to
continue it, as there is more important work pending.
But I didn't create a generic kdev_t, I changed the block device part to
use a bdev_t, I also started a few cleanups that make e.g. the partition
stuff a bit easier. On the other hand it breaks of course every block
device driver.
bye, Roman
