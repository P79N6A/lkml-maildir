Subject: [BK PATCH] LSM changes for 2.5.64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Here are the LSM changes that have been posted many times in the past.
They fix a few bugs in some of the existing security hooks, and add a
few more (hooks that is, not bugs :).  All of these patches have been
discussed on lkml with no known outstanding issues remaining about them.
Please pull from:
	bk://lsm.bkbits.net/linus-2.5
I'm only including the diffstat and short log format for these patches,
as they all have been posted to the lists in the past.
thanks,
greg k-h
