Looks like a bug. If you don't access hdc, then the read-ahead on hdc 
shouldn't matter. I wonder if the read-ahead code (either the setting or 
the reading) gets the value from the wrong queue or something.
Jens? This could certainly explain some of the confusion about
performance.. Do you see anything strange?
