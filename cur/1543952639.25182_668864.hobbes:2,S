It strikes me that the only way I can think of that you could have gotten 
a 7GB .git directory without really working at it is if you use one of the 
so-called "dumb" git protocols that just copy whole packfiles from 
kernel.org when you pull.
So do you happen to perhaps use http:// or rsync:// when you fetch git 
data? That would not only be horribly slow occasionally (you'd fetch 
all-new packs and re-download about 200MB of data when I repack the kernel 
repo on kernel.org, which happens about once or twice every release 
cycle), but it would also explain how it ballooned to 7GB for you (because 
you have all these duplicate packs!).
Usign the native git:// protocol would be much faster and avoid the issue 
in the future.
