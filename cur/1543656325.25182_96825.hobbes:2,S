Where is the CPU serializing instruction which must be executed before return
to user mode, so that kernel accesses to hardware devices are guaranteed to
complete before any subsequent user access begins?  (Otherwise a read/write
by the user to a memory-mapped device page can appear out-of-order with respect
to the kernel accesses in a preceding syscall.)  The only generally useful
serializing instructions are IRET and CPUID; only IRET is implemented univerally.
