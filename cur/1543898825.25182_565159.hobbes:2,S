Good catch.

I really dislike the overloading of acpi video flags in this way. You yourself 
have said in the past that new functionality should use /sys instead 
of /proc, and here you are overloading an existing variable for the sake of 
expediency. Please, stick with a new /sys/power entry.
Documentation is also an issue. Your patch should update the kernel_parameters 
file so users can know how to get the beeping to happen. It would be nice if 
it mentioned the proc entry too.

Do we? This version has advantages in not requiring any userspace app and in 
being able to work even if you can't yet get as far as having userspace 
working. [Reads more] Oh, do you mean a better way of setting this parameter 
(ie requiring the userspace app and then having it echo $VALUE

option, I can go with that. Does it need a patch to mark it as deprecated?

Beep_flags should be removed too if you're sticking with /proc.
