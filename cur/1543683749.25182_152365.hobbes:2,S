Maybe the timing changed?

Probably syslog would still work.]

Thanks! Let me comment it.

check_mux: First we probe for a Synaptics mux. Find none.
check_aux: Then we probe for a PS/2 mouse port. Find one.
Good. Found something. Call serio_register_port().
This searches for attached devices.
We know already that it is the PS/2 mouse port, but who knows
what might be connected. Let us try all devices we know about.
Is it perhaps a keyboard?

We wait for 99 jiffies, but no keyboard ID shows up.
Then try to set LEDs.

Get an error back. This mouse doesnt want to set its LEDs.
Is it perhaps a mouse?

No mouse ID either. No devices connected to this port, but
at least we have a port:

Then we continue, and check the keyboard side of the i8042 controller.
Things work satisfactorily, we detect a keyboard.
Silly enough we set it to scancode Set 2, but nevertheless give
commands that are only meaningful for scancode Set 3.
Keyboards that know only about Set 2 will be unhappy.

OK, found keyboard.

So far the story of your debug file.
What is your actual hardware? Is there a mouse?
