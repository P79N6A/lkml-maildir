Patched 2.2.0 (the real one). Problems. First, it appears as if you
neglected to include the diff against the Makefile (unless there is some
magic I'm missing). Once I got that done (I thought), I was seeing:
fbcon-vga.c:201: parse error before `EXPORT_SYMTAB_not_defined'
fbcon-vga.c:201: warning: data definition has no type or storage class
When compiling the file (which I added to the Makefile). There is probably
some trickery involved here, and it is too late for me to investigate now.
Anyway, it doesn't compile.
Any ideas?
