 This is a driver for the very common home-made parallel link cable, a cable 
 designed for connecting TI8x/9x graphing calculators (handhelds) to a computer
 or workstation (Alpha, Sparc). Given that driver is built on parport, the 
-parallel port abstraction layer, this driver is independent of the platform.

+TiLP will work for sure (since I am its developer!). yal92 may be able to use

 HOW TO USE IT:
 
 You must have first compiled parport support (CONFIG_PARPORT_DEV): either 
 compiled in your kernel, either as a module. 
-This driver supports the new device hierarchy (devfs).
 
-Next, (as root) from your appropriate modules directory (lib/modules/2.5.XX):
+Next, (as root):

 from it:
 
-       chmod 666 /dev/tipar?

 Now you are ready to run a linking program such as TiLP. Be sure to configure 
 it properly (RTFM).
