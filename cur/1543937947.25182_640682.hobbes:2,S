Hi Tejun
    There are three possibilities: (1) force everyone to use void *, (2) force 
everyone to be type-correct, (3) allow both with some tricks.  Currently 
we're on (1).  For kthread, with only dozens of users, I chose (2) (very 
simple, easy to understand).  I think for widespread things like timer and 
interrupt handlers, I think (3) is the right way to go.
    I wanted to get this patch out there and see what the reaction was.  I can 
do timers next, if that's going to add fuel to the discussion.
Thanks!
Rusty.
