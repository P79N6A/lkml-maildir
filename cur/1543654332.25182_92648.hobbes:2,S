I forgot about SuSE; yeah, they are using 1.28, but they did take the
patch.  (It's needed regardless of whether or not you're using HTREE
in the kernel; it can cause corrupted directories even if you're not
using ext3 htree's).
That being said, from what I can tell, SuSE does *not* support the
Htree changes, and you would be strongly advised to update to update
to the latest version of e2fsprogs before you enabled HTREE.  The
version of e2fsck that SuSE is missing some checks that detect some
incosistencies in the htree structure (not a bug deal, but it might
miss some corrupted filesystems) and is also missing some endian
bugfixes in the htree code (only a problem if you're using a
big-endian machine).
