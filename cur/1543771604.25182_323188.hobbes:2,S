Well that would turn out something like:
    printk(KERN_INFO "%s: %s %s %dKiB%s\n",
        md->disk->disk_name, mmc_card_id(card), mmc_card_name(card),
        (card->csd.capacity << card->csd.read_blkbits) / 1024,
        (!(card->csd.cmdclass & CCC_BLOCK_WRITE) ||
mmc_card_readonly(card)) ? " (ro)" : "");
which is a bit messy IMHO.
