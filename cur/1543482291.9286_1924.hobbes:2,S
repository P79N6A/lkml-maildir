Matti,
I agree with you, however I think Itai did highlight an interesting point
there. I confess that I missed that first EOVERFLOW case (whilst Itai
clearly missed the last one - so we are even :) ).
More to the point, the first case of EOVERFLOW:
    The file is a regular file, nbyte is greater than 0, the starting
    position is before the end-of-file and the starting position is
    greater than or equal to the offset maximum established in the open
    file description associated with fildes.
I am starting to think that this "offset maximum" is really RLIMIT_FSIZE
(see getrlimit(2)) because there is a provision for the starting position
to be before the end of file and at the same time greater than or equal to
the "offset maximum".
But, yes, what I said originally about pread() not setting errno=EOVERFLOW
when it should, remains correct.
Regards,
