How do you predict if a program is going to ask for more memory? Maybe it only
needs additional memory for a short time and is a good citizen and gives it
back?
How much disk needs to be allocated for swap? In 32 bit, each logged in user
is limited to 2 GB, so do we need 2 GB for each logged on user? 250 users, 500
GB of disk?
In a 64 bit system, how much swap would you reserve?
Actually, another OS took this approach in the early 70's and this was quickly
junked when they found out how much disk they really had to keep in reserve
for paging.

It may not be the "offending process" that is asking for more memory. How do
you judge "offending?"
