Huh? Take code of your non-blocking syscall. Make it ->read() for
relevant file on /proc or wherever else you want it. See read() not
blocking...
Whether code blocks or not depends on the code, not on the calling
conventions. And definitely not on ASCII vs. binary - conversion
between these formats _is_ doable without blocking operations.
