if you want to measure hw-interrupt delays then under PREEMPT_RT you'll 
need to use an SA_NODELAY interrupt handler. (which is a PREEMPT_RT 
specific flag) If you use normal request_irq() or some parport driver 
then the driver function will run in an interrupt thread and what you 
are measuring is not interrupt latency but rescheduling latency.
