Ahh. I thought the block layer wasn't aware of any IOMMU. Since I saw
those as bus specific I figured only the DMA APIs, which have access to
the device object, could know which IOMMU was to be used and how it
would merge segments.
So in my case I'll have to lie to the block layer. Iterating in the
driver will be much faster than having to do an entire new transfer.
Thanks for clearing things up. :)
