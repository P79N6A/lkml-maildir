Err... nope. :((
I've added the full 2.6.23-rc1-hrt1 patchset
(
http://www.tglx.de/projects/hrtimers/2.6.23-rc1/patch-2.6.23-rc1-hrt1.patch
),
and I do get the "Failed to force enable HPET",
so I know it's running that function, however it fails
since the 0x80 bit is NOT set after the force-enable
(which sadly happens to match my experience during my much earlier efforts
to try to get HPET to work on this board).
So, *please* (I'd *love* to get this working somehow):
whoever has a VT8235 and is listening here,
- give a "lspci -nn" (two 'n'!), to figure out details of chipset revision etc.
- give a "lspci -d 1106:3177 -xxx", to try to figure out whether there happen
  to be additional magical "enable" bits to map in those HPET I/O areas which
  some BIOS versions configure and some don't (that's my fragile theory
  at least)
- oh, and don't forget to tell whether HPET works or not
For my system (again, it's EPOX 8K5A2+ with VT8235):
