FWIW, my short-term plans include support for monotone-like hash ID
shortening - it's enough to use the shortest leading unique part of the
ID to identify the revision. I will poke to the object repository for
that. I also already have Randy Dunlap's git lsobj, which will list all
objects of a specified type (very useful especially when looking for
orphaned commits and such rather lowlevel work).
