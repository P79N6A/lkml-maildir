> also, how do you like the G450?
My first impressions of the g450 are spectacular.  I know it's not supposed
to be as fast as the dual Nvidia offerings, but I don't play games and Matrox
has always been tops when it comes to text appearance.  It's fast as can be
driving two monitors at 1600x1200 and not too expensive to boot.  I like it.

That's good enough for me!
