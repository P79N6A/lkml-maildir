How is the status of IPsec for IPv6?

We've almost done.
One thing that I'll contribute before the feature freeze is:
  - Privacy Extensions for IPv6 addrconf
The remaining things which we DO want to see in 2.6 are:
  - check is "rmmod ipv6" is ok
  - IPv6 source address selection; which will be mandated by the 
    node requirement.
  - IPsec for IPv6
  - make IPv6 non-experimental :-)
  - several enhancements on specification conformity
    (neighbour discovery etc.)
Thanks.
