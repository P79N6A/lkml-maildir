Yes, that's right.  The error is being returned from xfs_create when
quota has been exceeded.  It ends up carrying back to the filp_open call
in do_sys_open, which returns it as a pointer to a filp structure. 
Because the errno is so large, IS_ERR reports it as being a valid
pointer incorrectly.
XFS has acted correctly.  The only reason I bring it up is this is how
the bug was brought to my attention.  
If there won't be any strange side effects (I don't have the experience
to accurately comment on this), I think turning the threshold value up
to something we can get away with in IS_ERR_VALUE() would be
appropriate.
