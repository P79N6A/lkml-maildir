Hi everybody!
I just wrote a short app to play a bit with high number of processes, high
loads and response times to keyboard etc. This app should fork about 2000
times (on kernel 2.2.7 patches with NR_TASKS == 4000 and proper settings
with ulimit -u).  But I never reached 2000 processes;(  Sometimes, fork
fails (return value is -1), which is _good_, sa the system stays in an
usable state. But somtimes no error is reported. System reacts to console
switching, screen scrolling (shift-PageUp) and SysRq, _but_ SysRq-S seems
to _not_ physically sync the disks! SysRq-p shown a processor spending all
its time to mm/vmscan.c:swap_out().
Any suggestions?
MfG, JBG
