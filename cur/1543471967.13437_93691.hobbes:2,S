I don't presume to answer for Linus, but there are several points
here:
1) Linus and most of us are not being paid for this, and we are not
   doing this to sell.  There *are* only technical issues.
2) I'm sorry, but part of being a professional *is* telling the
   customer what's good for them.  It's called professional
   integrity.
3) Isn't 'telling the customer what's good for them' exactly what
   Oracle et al. would be doing here?
4) Linus has made it clear a number of times on this issue that he
   doesn't think raw disk device access is a good idea, and he's not
   prepared to add such a feature to the kernel just because 'everyone 
   else does it'.

Well, you could still use a partition like /dev/sda1 for a database -- 
the only issue is that this goes through the buffer cache instead of
reading or writing directly to the disk.
