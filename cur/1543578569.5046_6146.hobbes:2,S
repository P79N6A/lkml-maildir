No.

Yes, it's the input core code, but without a separate directory or 
main_menu entry :-(. That means that currently on PPC people have to select 
CONFIG_USB even if they just want to have the input core code for 
CONFIG_INPUT_ADBHID. Since Alan rejected the creation of drivers/input in 
2.2 for unknown (?) reasons, I suggest to add a 2nd main_menu in 
usb/Config.in for CONFIG_INPUT items. Then adjust drivers/Makefile in a way 
that drivers/usb is entered if CONFIG_USB is unset but CONFIG_INPUT is set.
Franz.
