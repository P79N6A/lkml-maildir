I thought (it seems that I was mistaken) that the goal of monotonic_clock
is to privide high-resolution cheap timestamps that are guaranteed never
go back as there is no adjustments to the time. The normal clock it supposed
to be stable and accurate but probably give lower resolution. In case of
pmtmr vs. TSC seems to have higher resolution and is cheap so it was used.
