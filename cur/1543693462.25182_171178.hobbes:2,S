So I have two threads that are doing IO on a file descriptors with the
number 5, I get an unexpected EPIPE on "5", now what?  I kept track.  Who is
it for?
Yea, I know:
1) add the other flag to clone()
2) mask the signal off completely
3) wake everybody who has a 5 in their file descriptor table (except that I
can't see anybody elses' file descriptor table)
4) wake everybody
5) let the owner task notice the problem when it gets back around to using
"5"
5) Just die like a good little program
Since it doesn't do all the things I expect from the common definition of
"thread"; and it isn't documented anywhere I can find online or in the
kernel tree; what is the kernel actually promising me when I use
CLONE_THREAD anyway?  How is it more than (CLONE_VM|CLONE_SIGHAND)?
[I see a bit about exiting as a group and I assume that CPU usage statistics
are aggregated amongst the threads.  Is that it?]
And I'll bet two dollars I won't be the last to ask... 8-)
You've seen my other arguments about expectation and consistency so I'll
stop now, I promise. 8-)
Rob.

You have to explicitly _ask_ for SIGIO. If you do so, and you don't share
file descriptors, that's _your_ problem.
But it does indeed have perfectly valid semantics - the signal may well
just wake up a thread: and in fact, as most IO is illegal in signal
handler context anyway, it usually has to. 
Clearly, if you have per-thread file descriptors, you have to keep track 
of which thread is doing what.
