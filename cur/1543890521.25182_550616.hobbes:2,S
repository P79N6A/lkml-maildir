I guess it's along the lines of
- portability
(note how this contradicts itself). Really. I have yet to
figure out why everyone invents their own xxx32_t types,
like e.g. glib. well, integer types, one might understand, but when it
comes to gchar or gpointer, that's just plain microsoft-style
(think LPCSTR and LPCVOID...)
