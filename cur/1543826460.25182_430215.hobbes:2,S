For what I know (and I could be wrong) max is around -40dBm/MHz 
in the US. I am no expert in the nitty-gritty radio details, but 
I've been told that is 3000 times less emissions than a common 
cellphone, around .1 uW? [this is where my knowledge about radio
*really* fades].

I think some companies are starting to make PDKs available this
summer, but YMMV.
