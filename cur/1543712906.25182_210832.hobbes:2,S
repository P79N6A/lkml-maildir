The power-on or hardware-reset default for the ix86 FPU
is to attempt to handle div 0 errors transparently.
In others words:
R = 1 / (1/r1 + 1/r2 + 1/r3 +...) will resolve correctly
if any r...n = 0. Parallel resistance when one or more
resistors is 0 ohms.
This it probably not the default for the Itanium so your
application either needs to be fixed or at least needs to
set the FPU to handle these problems. The configuration of
the FPU remains, per-process, so some executable could
be run upon login to "fix" the processor.
The following program should cause the bad program to
core-dump any time it is run. You could also configure
this so it lets anybody write garbage and it will "work".

{
    __setfpucw(_FPU_DEFAULT & ~FPU_MASK);
}
main() {
   double zero=0.0;
   double one=1.0;
   fpu();
   one /=zero;  // Testing, remove this after
}
