If we feel a bug should be fixed without waiting for a major release
(98%+ of bugs), we try to fix it in 3 days, and usually succeed at
that.  Not all users agree with us that a given bug should wait for a
major release.

Now that we  (Nikita actually) solved it in Reiser4 by handling
duplicate keys  I now realize that I could have solved it in V3 years
ago if I had been brighter, but since V4 is ready I think it is better
to not destabilize code in V3 by changing things now.  It might touch a
lot of lines of code to fix in V3, Nikita would know better than I.

This is VFS/VM not us.  You are right that it should be fixed, as it is
indicative of deep problems with the memory management code that require
fundamental changes.

Yes, it would be nice, could you email chris@suse.com about it?  This is
a feature that is ok to add to a stable branch, I cannot logically
define why but I feel it is so....   after much testing and a beta
though....   Note that V4 fixes this by using wandering logs.....

That are specific to reiserfs rather than all of Linux, I think not.....

Not if you use device mapper.

Not sure what you mean.  Forgive me, I have not supervised fsck as
closely as other things.

Thank you for your suggestions and advice,
