I agree with your analysis.  Just for my own fun playing with
profiling, I ran the two tests on a 1.5Ghz Itanium 2 (I compiled with
the Intel compiler lest you all laugh at how slow the "Itanic" is at
multiplying matrices).

Both close, certainly nothing like some other reports.  But as with
all benchmarking the devil is in the details; watching the cache
misses:
ianw@baci:/usr/src/tmp/maptest$ pfmon --events=L3_MISSES ./mm-privmmap
                    112678 L3_MISSES
ianw@baci:/usr/src/tmp/maptest$ pfmon --events=L3_MISSES ./mm-sharemmap
                  68600586 L3_MISSES
So it's no wonder shared mmap takes a little longer.  And indeed,
modifying your program to touch the memory in the privmmap call brings
the two into line.
Also looking at the kernel profiling via q-syscollect, the only
significant difference is private mapping spends about 19% of it's
time in clear_page, whilst shared spends around 29% of it's time in
clear_page.  All things being equal, you can thus expect to run ~10%
slower with shared, which is pretty close to what you actually see.
