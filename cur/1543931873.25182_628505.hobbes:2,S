how about doing a known-NOP chipset cycle? For example:
  inb(PIC_SLAVE_IMR)
? I.e. instead of trying to find an unused port, lets try to find a 
known-used platform register that has no side-effects if read. Use it 
unconditionally during early bootup and change it to an udelay after 
calibration. (or use it after early bootup too if a boot parameter has 
been specified) Or something like this.
