Dear Mr. Vojtech,
I learn that you are the author for PS/2 mouse driver on Linux 2.6.x 
kernel.
I just want to share a little change that  I've did to 
psmouse_pm_callback() which without this, my synaptics touchpad would 
prevent my laptop (IBM Thinkpad T30) from suspending.
I don't remember how the functions read at first. But this is how it 
become. This is not exactly a patch, huh? Sorry, but I hope it helps.
I also not sure if this patch already done the right thing and I haven't 
tested it on other machine. It works for me, but I can't promise if it 
blows up others. Maybe you could give it a test?
The kernel version was 2.6.0-test9 from Debian (not vanilla, but I'm 
sure the psmouse part is clean).
This is the function:
static int psmouse_pm_callback(struct pm_dev *dev, pm_request_t request, 
void *data)
{
        struct psmouse *psmouse = dev->data;
        struct serio_dev *ser_dev = psmouse->serio->dev;
                                                                               
 
        switch (request) {
        case PM_RESUME:
                psmouse->state = PSMOUSE_IGNORE;
                serio_rescan(psmouse->serio);
        default:
                return 0;
        }
}
Sorry if this just bothers you.
I'm cc-ing also to [linux-kernel], but I'm not subscribed to the list yet.
Best Regards,
