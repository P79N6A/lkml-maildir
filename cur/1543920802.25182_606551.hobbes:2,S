Well, in practice, it will only crash with DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, so few enough 
are going to be hit by it. In that sense I don't think we're in any deep 
trouble yet.
That said, maybe this is an acceptable, if hacky, replacement for the 
current "for_each_sg()" loop.
It does:
 - starts at one *before* the sglist
 - does the sg_next() at the *top* of the loop rather than the bottom of it
 - has a "--count" before that sg_next, so that we don't do it for the 
   case when we break out and have used up all segments.
Totally untested, but it *may* work, and it doesn't look horribly ugly.
Ingo, does this actually make any difference?
