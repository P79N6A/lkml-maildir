Hm. I was right. ;)

4) Never never never never NEVER compile for 586+
You lost several days debugging this. It's $days*24*60*60=$days*86400 seconds
~= $days * 86400000000000 CPU cycles. A bit high price for using optimized
binaries, eh?
IMHO:
Speed optimizations make sense in heavy CPU bound tasks like bzip2.
CPU-heavy part of code is usually small, can be hand-optimized.
The remaining 99,999% of code is best optimized for size.
At least you will save on pagein and icache footprint.
After you happily compiled a piece of code with all bells and
whistles for your new shiny 986+ processor, do take a look at
generated assembly. There might be surprizes.
BTW, will anyone bet that gcc generates better code with cmov's
than without? ;)
