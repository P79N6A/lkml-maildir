kbuild-2.5 - miscellaneous makefiles
Here we have misc Makefiles patched and/or added.
You will need this patch in generic for kbuild-2.5.
You can still compile the kernel with only this patch applied, but then
you could even leave it. You'd better pull the rest of kbuild-2.5, too.
This patch is available from
