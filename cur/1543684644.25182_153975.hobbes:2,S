do you really want the processor on the card to be tunning
apache/NFS/Samba/etc ?
putting enough linux on the card to act as a router (which would include
the netfilter stuff) is one thing. putting the userspace code that
interfaces with the outside world for file transfers is something else.
if you really want the disk connected to your network card you are just
talking a low-end linux box. forget all this stuff about it being on a
card and just use a full box (economys of scale will make this cheaper)
making a firewall that's a core system with a dozen slave systems attached
to it (the network cards) sounds like the type of clustering that Linux
has been used for for compute nodes. complicated to setup, but extremely
powerful and scalable once configured.
if you want more then a router on the card then Alan Cox is right, just
add another processor to the system, it's easier and cheaper.
