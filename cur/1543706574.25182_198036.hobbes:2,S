/me groks now. I am assuming this is a 2.7 thing as it is
reinterpreting/redefining the API. In ARM, pci_dma_sync_single() does
a cache flush, which is why I was confused asked about two cache flushes.
What you are proposing is that by definition pci_dma_sync_* syncs 
bridges caches with system memory, while pci_dma_sync_device_* syncs 
the CPU's cache with system memory.
This will definetely confuse a lot of driver writers.
