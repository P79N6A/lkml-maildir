tulip should work better IMHO for all davicom tulip clones -except- the
older ones which require doing a software crc for each packet.  For
those, the performance penalty is too high to integrate into the
mainline tulip driver.  So my advice is usually "try tulip, then
fallback to dmfe if software crc is required"
