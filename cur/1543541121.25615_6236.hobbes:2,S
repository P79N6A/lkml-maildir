The flat binary - the uClinux people called - is based on coff format.
I don't know specs of coff.
In source-view, it seems to be from a.out format.
IMHO the LinuxCE's XIP is kernel-XIP, not application & library XIP.
Because of large shared library we'll use,
We want elf-based XIP binfmt.
Perhaps I'll work for it, but can't see the way.
