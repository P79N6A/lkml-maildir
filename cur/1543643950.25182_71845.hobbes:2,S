Subject: [PATCH] to fix 2.5.36 MTRR for X  (Was: X freezes and input problems)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/9/19/20

This patch fixes MTRR for me, restoring the mtrr_add_page() old return value behaviour that X seems to need.
The input problem (mouse pointer jumping) seems to be in sylpheed only, so it is application problem.
