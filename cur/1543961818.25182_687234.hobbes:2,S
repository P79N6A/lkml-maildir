Thanks for your feedback.

The task parameter would be current.
Apart from that, you would use it the same way it is used in
arch/x86/kernel/ptrace.c.
You would want to bts_configure() it to disable tracing before you start
reading your own BTS buffer.

I was referring to the 'task' parameter for the below functions.
I will try to find a better wording.

I'll remove it - for ds.c, as well.

The variable is write-once. It is written during boot time. It is not
locked.
I'll add a comment.

Stephane asked for those exports - for the DS symbols, at least - in
order to use it with perfmon2.

I'll replace it.

Hmmm, the symbols would have the same name as the respective
bts_configuration field (except for _tr, which actually is TR | BTS).

Ok.
Is there some special format that I should use?

I'm sure that's not complete.
That's all the hardware I have direct access to.
Supporting more hardware is a small thing, but it adds to the testing
obligation.
I'd rather add more hardware after the feature is working OK.

I'll do that - and for ds.c, as well.

It's not a serious error condition; it's more a QoI thing. You might get
more trace than you asked for.
I'll add a function to return a bit-mask of supported features for this
architecture and fail with an error if a requested feature is not
supported.

I tried to git-revert an old version of the patch to replace it with an
updated version. 
I had also split the patch into three smaller pieces for the three
different layers.
But there's so much on top of it that I ended up with conflicts. The
easiy thing for me would be to just send out another patch on top of it.
For this one, I expect it won't be applied, so I simply resend a
corrected version some time next week.
thanks and regards,
markus.
