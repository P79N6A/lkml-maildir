I've been looking for documentation on how to do this, and have so far
come up blank.  Any pointers to comprehensive documentation would be much
appreciated.
Here's what I'm working with:
Linux 2.2.1 kernel
  c-qcam module installed
  videodev module installed
  parport modules installed and working
/etc/conf.modules
  alias char-major-81 videodev
  alias parport_lowlevel parport_pc
  options -k parport_pc io=0x378,0x278 irq=none,11
So...  What options line can I add to conf.modules that will tell it that
it's video capture device should answer to char-major-81-0 and map to
c-qcam.o which should attach directly to parport1?
Also, since the kernel recognizes the color quickcam during plug-n-play
probing, is there a way I can have the appropriate modules primed
automatically?
I've been looking through the documentation for a couple of days, and the
answer to these questions just doesn't jump out at me off the screen.
