We're pretty agnostic about this.  I agree that if we were to make this
a system call, then it should be restricted to root.  Or make it a
sysctl.  Whichever way you guys want to go is fine with us.

I have two observations about this:
(1)  It is our intent to use the infrastructure provided by this patch
      as the basis for an automatic (i. e. included with the VM) approach
      that selectively removes unused page cache pages before spilling
      off node.  We just figured it would be easier to get the
      infrastructure in place first.
(2)  If a sufficiently well behaved application knows in advance how
      much free memory it needs per node, then it makes sense to provide
      a mechanism for the application to request this, rather than for
      the VM to try to puzzle this out later.  Automatic algorithms in
      the VM are never perfect; they should be reserved to work in those
      cases where the application(s) either cooperate in such a way to
      make memory demands impossible to predict, or the application
      programmer can't (or can't take the time to) predict how much
      memory the application will use.
