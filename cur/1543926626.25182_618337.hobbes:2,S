Subject: [PATCH 2/2] MN10300: Fix MTD JEDEC probe so that the ASB2303 bootprom can be detected
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/16/72

Fix MTD JEDEC probe so that the ASB2303 bootprom can be accessed.  This is
presumably required because the bootprom is normally write-protected and so
the normal flash probes don't work as they require the ability to write to the
flash to send it commands.
In the condition of the excluded if-statement, uaddr is 1.
