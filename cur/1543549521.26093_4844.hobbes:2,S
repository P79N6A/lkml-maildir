No. Adding data the attacker knows cannot make the attack harder to any
significant extent. At best, it might increase attack overheads by some
small factor. What you need for security are things that cost little or
nothing for legitmate users but increase attack difficulty exponentially.

A nice match for 3DES might be the Tiger hash. 192-bit output, faster
than SHA or MD5 on 64-bit machines, about the same on 32-bit.

Yes it does. If the passphrase entropy is 100 bits, the best brute
force attack is to try all 2^100 possibilities. If it is 200 bits,
or 500, the best brute force attack is to ignore the passphrase
and try the 2^160 possible outputs from the first hash. There is
no case where you have to try all 2^192 possible 3DES keys against
this scheme.
Of course, this likely does not matter provided the passphrase has
adequate entropy, say 90 bits based on:
http://www.counterpane.com/keylength.html
or perhaps 100 today, given Moore's law. As long as you have enough
entropy to frustrate brute force attacks, the exact amount is not
important.

Yes, but short or weak passphrases are a serious danger.

My guess would be that most passphrases have far less than that. Estimates
I've seen for normal English text are not much over 1 bit/character. You
might use nonsense in a passphrase, so perhaps 2 to 4 bits? At that rate,
you need a 40 to 80 character passphrase to get 160-bit entropy.
Also, if people are constructing pass phrases in some predictable way, there
are attacks based on that. e.g try a dictionary of quotations, and write
programs to do standard substitutions, both at character level:
"n0w is the time f0r all good men to come to the aid 0f the c0untry"
and, following some grammatical rules, at word level:
"now is the time for all good wombats to come to the aid of the motorcycle"
I'm not certain how expensive or how effective such attacks would be, but
they are certainly possible and, given several decades of experience with
users choosing bad passwords, I'd be willing to wager they would work in
at least some cases.

I agree there.
