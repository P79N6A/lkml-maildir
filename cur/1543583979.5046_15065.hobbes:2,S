I'm not arguing it was a smart thing to do, but I would think that the
fs/kernel/driver writers could keep really nasty and un-expected things
from happenning.  For instance, the driver could dis-allow any new (non-hdparm)
writes while hdparm is doing it's test.  Or maybe the driver could realize it
was being told to do something that would break and just not do it?
Considering this disk is my root disk, is there *any* safe way to test
out hdparm on this disk?
Enjoy,
Ben
