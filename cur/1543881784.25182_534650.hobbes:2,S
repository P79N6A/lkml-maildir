Ok, that would explain some odd performance issues I've noticed.
Let's say I run
dstat -D sda,sdb,sdc,sdd,md0 5
----total-cpu-usage---- --disk/sda----disk/sdb----disk/sdc----disk/sdd----disk/md0- -net/total-

Given I'm doing a read, I would have expected a read to consist of 2 direct reads, one parity read 
and some calculation. The numbers I'm seeing however show 3 reads for 2 reads worth of bandwidth.
