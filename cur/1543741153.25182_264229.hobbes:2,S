I'm seeing an odd build error in the -U10.3 patch to 2.6.9-mm1:
    <snip>
  AS      arch/i386/boot/compressed/head.o
  CC      arch/i386/boot/compressed/misc.o
  OBJCOPY arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux.bin
BFD: Warning: Writing section `.bss' to huge (ie negative) file offset 
0xc03ac000.
objcopy: arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux.bin: File truncated
make[2]: *** [arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux.bin] Error 1
make[1]: *** [arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux] Error 2
make: *** [bzImage] Error 2
[root@otaku linux-2.6.9]# objdump -f vmlinux
vmlinux:     file format elf32-i386
architecture: i386, flags 0x00000112:
EXEC_P, HAS_SYMS, D_PAGED
start address 0x00100000
This appears a result of changes in:
   arch/i386/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S
apparently for support of CONFIG_KERN_PHYS_OFFSET.
This causes the kernel LMA start address to
change from 0xc0100000 to 0x100000 and objcopy to
gag.  I rolled back to a 2.6.9-mm1 version of the
above linker map file and did get the kernel to
build and boot.
Anyone else seeing this?  .config attached.
BTW, the -U10.2 patch seems to have disappeared
