There are no "harmless" IP addresses. Those that aren't routed
are often used on internal networks. If you default to one of
those you could still collide with a machine - possibly a critical
workgroup server :-).

Your monitor might. Mine is rather older. Last time I upgraded
my video card the driver decided to use a completely stupid
refresh frequency. The smart mode editor would not run unless
I was actually using the driver. I had to change the refresh
using keyboard navigation based on two screenshots of an earlier
version in the two page "docs" and by watching the way the
flickering changed. In my experience this is not atypical of
the fun you can have with PCs when they aren't completely
new builds.
