Hello:
I was investigating an oops and the trace looked like this:

What is with those recursive handle_mm_fault calls?
That does not look quite right. I _assume_ that the
stack would collapse properly upon return, but still...
I would appreciate a suggestion about what .S file to read
for the explanation.
