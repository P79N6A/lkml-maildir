I don't have this problem on 2.4.18, but I did on 2.5 kernels.  On my 
box, it had something to do with the display manager (kdmh).  When I 
boot to runlevel 3 and run startx manually (without kdm) I have no 
virtual console problems.  That's my workaround for now.
I don't know what causes the problem.  If anyone else has an idea to 
share, that'd be great.
