If you really plan to use this huge amount of rules, you have to
arrange them in several chains, or else your machine will be unusable
at not-too-high network loads.
I did an experiment with 65536 rules and when inserted in the same
chain one after another, even a simple ping was serious pain to the
machine - a K6-2/333). It was _much_ better when arranging them into a
256chain*256entry scheme, and it seems to do best at 4x4x4x...x4
arrangement. (I only tried this with equal chain lengths.) There's the
result of my experiment (currently only in Hungarian, but I'll
translate it to English if there's interest) at
