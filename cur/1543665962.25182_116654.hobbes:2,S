This sounds like the old GPL argument.
The GPL'd redistributor has to supply the source, they don't have to
supply it in the format that's best for you, being an 80mm tape drive
cuz you're stuck in the punch card age.
Seriously, if CVS loses all that data, is that BK's fault?  BK's so
powerful because it has more information than anyone else, but it's
not their fault (and it's not proprietary data) that no-one else can
deal with the data when it's exported, now is it????
It's not a significant data loss when you try to view a 24bpp image
on an 8bpp display, so it's not a significant data loss that CVS can't
handle the BK.  If it could, Linus would've switched to CVS instead....
I'm not saying Larry's a God or anything, I'm just hoping you guys can
give it up already.  Linus uses BK, nobody else needs to, so move on!
