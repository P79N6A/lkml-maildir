Sort of half fixed in 2.5.47.

I have updates that will fix some stuff, not this one. I know why this
occurs. Its trivial to make it go away, it requires some major work to
make it go away properly in the context of SATA and hotswap.
The latest patches split the ide registratio code from the ide i/o code.
Its now possible to read all the registration code in one place. I'm now
commenting it ready to rip it to shreds.
And yes now ide.c in 2.5.47-ac1 is basically just the registration code
it must qualify for some of the ugliest code in the kernel ;)
