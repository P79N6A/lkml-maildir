Alan - been hunting a problem for a week that has been taking down 
half our net. Bridge may be implicated. The common denominator is
  A kernel in the range 2.0.25-36
  bridging compiled in but not enabled,
  a NIC that has been put in promiscuous mode for some time
  and which then gets into a state in which it won't respond to ARP (or
  ping, etc.). 
Look - here:
1 itserv2:/> ping lm013
  PING lm013.lab.it.uc3m.es (163.117.144.142): 56 data bytes
  (nothing)                                                           
2 itserv2:/> grep 142 /proc/net/arp

Hurrrrrrrrr.
That machine has bridging configured on a modified 2.0.25 kernel and is
running a 3c905 on a 100BT switched net.

eth0: 3Com 3c905 Boomerang 100baseTx at 0x6100, 00:60:97:ba:bf:de, IRQ 10  
My machine is doing the same, and is running a pure 2.0.36 kernel (!)
and an intel card.
eepro100.c:v0.99B 4/7/98 Donald Becker linux-eepro100@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov   
eth0: Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100 at 0xe400, 00:90:27:12:1A:C0, IRQ 12.    
The problem is most pronounced on a subnet of 100MHz pentia with 3c509b
cards and 2.0.25 kernels. They were working happily for 2 years
and just moved over to join the bigger net on a powerhub fibre-driven
substrate.  I moved the driver up to 1.13b from 1.07 last sunday. It
helped - probably because it resets the 3c509b's when they collapse
completely.
These packets are an appreciable fraction of the net traffic.  They're
labelled as spanning tree in the lists, according to the multicast
address.  The slow net is switched through the powerhub, where it joins
a fast switched 100BT net on 3c3000 switches.
I don't think they're taking down the net, but _something_ is. It seems
that all affected cards get into a mode where they won't do ARP, even
though they're correctly configured as MULTICAST, etc. From inside
one of these machines, one can see packets, and one can see that we're not
responding to arp.
Taking the interface down and up again fixes the problem. No need to
reload the drivers.
Any ideas? What should be looked at next.
Peter
