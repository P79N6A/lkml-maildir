Using a 64-bit or PAE kernel won't give access to more than 4GB of RAM
because that only increases the linear address space of the CPU to 48 or
36 bits respectively. The limitation with 945GT is that the chipset only
supports 32-bit physical addresses. As Andi already pointed out, parts of
that 4GB physical address space are used by devices and their apertures,
so you can only try to shrink those devices ranges, if configurable, but
you won't be able to use the full 4GB RAM.
