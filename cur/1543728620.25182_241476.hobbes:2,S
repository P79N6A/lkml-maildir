There are some people who would rather not have a CD at all if it is 
even slightly defective. Jorg is one of those, and I am for backups. I 
also verify backup CDs with his c2scan option to see just how clean the 
burn is.
There's an option, you can use it or not. Maybe a burnfree CD will be 
just as good in 3-4 years, but CDs are cheap, I'll burn another if need 
be. I don't know how much this helps, but I understand terms like "good 
faith effort" and "best practices." I have no problem with making the 
user specify that option.
