I tried the suggestions and was able to force the error to occur.  I took
the box out of service and ran memtest86 for a week and got a bunch of
errors.  The problem appears to have been caused by faulty hardware.
I have the exact same configuration running in a box with duplicate
hardware and am not having any problems.
