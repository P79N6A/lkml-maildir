What was the problem with the ACPI table?
I would suggest you file a proper bug report on that on
http://bugzilla.kernel.org
 (with boot log of the failure)

There is nothing pointing to a lockup in your dmesg
(except perhaps the message about the disconnected timer,
but even then it normally works)
But in general you typically need ACPI for modern machines
because the old style mptables are untested or not even available.
