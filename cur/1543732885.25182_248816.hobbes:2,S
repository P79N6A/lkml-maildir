I did this and built a broken kernel. I panics very early in start up.
I also got warnings like
kernel/sched.c: In function __might_sleep
kernel/sched.c:4974: warning: prev_jiffy might be used uninitialized in
this function
which if I read the code right should be a local static variable.
I suppose you meant
 #define inline
instead (which throws a warning about a duplicate definition; can I
ignore it?)
