Just wanted to give some long-term feedback on an old kernel... My primary
NFS/Samba/DHCP/mail server machine has been running 2.4.9-ac10 for 130 days
under moderate load with no problems whatsoever. Kudos to all developers.
Now I have to reboot the thing to add ext3 and software RAID; I'll be trying
2.4.17 with Andre's IDE patch and Rik's rmap...
Regards,
Dan
