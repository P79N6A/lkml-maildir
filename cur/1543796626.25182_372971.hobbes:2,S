You're wrong. First if you say "monotonic" you don't understand the problem.
Monotonicity is only a small part of it.  The bigger one is just 
getting the current frequency and figuring out of if the information
is safe to use.
Chips where it doesn't work:
- Intel Prescott and derivatives (newer Pentium 4, newer Xeon, on
Celeron you are still lucky because they normally don't have speedstep): 
TSC runs at a different frequency than the current P state and P state often 
varies with speedstep [These are the most common desktop chips in the world, 
although not all have speedstep enabled. Many newer ones have though.]
- Intel P-M and earlier P4,P3 mobile chips, Athlon 64, Athlon XP-M,
Opteron etc: 
TSC varies with P state and user space has no way to get timely 
updates on P-state changes.
- VIA C3: I believe TSC stops in idle (at least it used to on
older versions, don't know if they fixed it)
