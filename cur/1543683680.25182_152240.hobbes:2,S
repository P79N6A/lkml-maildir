I know udev.
udev does not answer my question. It operates on logical device (bus) numbers. 
My question was how to name devices based on physical position 
*independently* of logical numbers they get.
It is not strictly speaking udev fault but simply result of kernel exporting 
logical device names instead of true physical paths. I miss Solaris /devices 
filesystem ...
OK I may mot see something obvious. Simple example.
I have SCSI HBA sitting in PCI slot 3. It gets SCSI host number 1. I configure 
udev to name SCSI device 1.0.0.1 "database"
I add one more SCSI HBA in PCI slot 1. Next time system is booted *this* gets 
SCSI host number 1 and my first HBA in slot 3 gets SCSI host 2. Oops.
Question: how to configure udev so that "database" always refers to LUN 0 on 
target 0 on bus 0 on HBA in PCI slot 1.

I thank you

PS this obviously applies not only to SCSI. It is just it is most simple 
example and you do not open network interfaces by name so there is *no* way 
at all to assign their numbers :(
