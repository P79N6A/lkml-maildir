OK, but in the above case, "do something" cannot be sleeping, since
it is under rcu_read_lock().

Right, if you have some other code path that sleeps (outside of
rcu_read_lock(), right?), then you need the reference count for that
code path.  But the code paths that do not sleep should be able to
dispense with the reference count, reducing the cache-line traffic.
