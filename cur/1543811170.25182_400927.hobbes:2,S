Always building drivers/rtc/utils.o even if no RTC support is enabled 
seems to be a workaround for an issue that should instead be fixed 
properly:
The code in e.g. fs/udf/udftime.c or drivers/scsi/ips.c has some 
overlaps with what you are adding (they are not doing exactly the 
same, but there are overlaps).
We should have one common set of defines/inlines/functions dealing with 
all these time conversion, leap year, length of months/years etc. issues 
instead of adding one more implementation in this area.
