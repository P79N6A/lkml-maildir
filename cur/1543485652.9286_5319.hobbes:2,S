Or possibly far more usefull for most users.. Coda+kerberos5, which I am
seriously looking at right now. Support for the Coda ACL's in the kernel
would be exceedingly great, IMHO. Maybe even kerberos5 principals could be
supported, as in the joeuser@KRB.REALM has normal privledges, and the
joeuser/admin@KRB.REALM has adminstrative root-like power. Is this
reasonable/possible, or am I only dreaming?
