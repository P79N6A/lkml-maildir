It doesn't.
Fork is only a 'really hot path' if you have a fork bomb running. The 
scheduler is a really hot path (which Suspend2 patches don't touch, by the 
way).
The change in the page allocation routine follows a comment saying "This is 
the last chance, in general, before the goto nopage." It adds one further 
test to the four already done at that point.
Regards,
Nigel
