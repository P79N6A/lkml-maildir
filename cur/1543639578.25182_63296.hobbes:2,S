Incorrect - they frequently make it to the list, I have the headers to 
prove it.
Unfortunately, unless the LKML maintainers wish to either filter the 
list against Spamcop|Spamhaus|MAPS, or unless they are willing to 
require non-registered individuals to confirm an email (i.e. 
non-registered individual sends a mail, LKML sends a "you aren't 
registered, so please reply to this email to confirm you aren't a 
spammer" message), there is little they can do about it.
