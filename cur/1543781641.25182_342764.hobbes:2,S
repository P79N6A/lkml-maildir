Subject: BUG? [PATCH] driver core: Add the ability to bind drivers to devices from userspace
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

If a driver's probe function returns -ENXIO or -ENODEV,
driver_probe_device() will translate that to return 0 (comments argue it
is not an error).
Consequently driver_bind() will return 0 resulting in the write
system-call that initiated all of this in returning 0 as well.
If one uses "echo" to write to a "bind" attribute, echo will
continuously call write() trying to write to the attribute and always
get 0 as a result and thus find itself in a loop trying to do the write.
Perhaps the translation of -ENZIO to -ENODEV to success in
driver_probe_device() is not approriate here?
