Is anyone using a machine simulator on Linux?
A machine simulator simulates the behaviour of a
machine, including CPU(s), memory, L1/2/3 caches,
buses, and other hardware devices. I think it helps if
we can run Linux under such a simulator. We can find
out where the kernel is spending most of the time
waiting, etc. Moreover, we can find the behaviour of a
normal application, including the number of kernel
calls, network access pattern, memory access pattern,
cache miss, etc.
The only machine simulator that I know is the SimOS
and it is open source. Does anyone get it work under
Linux or moreover get Linux work under it? BTW, is
there another simulator available?
