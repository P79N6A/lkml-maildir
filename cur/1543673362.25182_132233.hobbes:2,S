Then the linux code won't work on it, have you tried? I've tried a lot
of different IBM models, they all do service interrupts just fine.

That's correct, you can use the release interrupt to get around that...

It should make a non-neglible difference in smart positioning in the
drive, some things just cannot be done in software for this stuff.
