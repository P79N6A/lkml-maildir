	Hi all,
If we are talking about 2.4 there are two options:
	- call init_etherdev() with arguments == 0;
	- call it with non zero arguments;
Successful return from init_etherdev(0,0) means that
ethernet device is already registered and "eth?" is
asigned to the driver allocated. This requires unregister_netdev()
on driver exit (in MODULE case).
If init_etherdev(0,0) returns NULL (i.e. error) there is no
need to take any action - no devices were registered nor
memory was allocated.
When init_etherdev() fails if called with arguments then you
need you need to release previous allocated resources in reverse
order.
