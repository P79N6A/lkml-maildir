I got a (moderately old) Sun V20z with 2 Opteron 2.2 GHz with 7G ram.
My numbers are comparable with yours. (I don't know if they are on the

Mine is (with your configuration file, src updated with latest linus' tree,
[om@turyxsrv /home/src/linux-2.6]$  time make -j4
...snipped...
real    4m12.316s
user    5m12.600s
sys     0m37.742s
With stdout redirected, (It helps to save a minute or so )
[om@turyxsrv /home/src/linux-2.6]$ time make -j4  >>time.txt
real    3m23.504s
user    5m14.776s
sys     0m38.138s
