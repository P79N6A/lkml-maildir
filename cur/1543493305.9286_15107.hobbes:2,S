Yes, that's correct.

Just so that you guys know, those register bits _are_ programmed to be
read-only. I called PLX on Friday and they told me that in the way we are 
programming the EEPROM, once the chip receives the assignment from the
BIOS, these bits (related to the addressing type) are turned into
read-only. And based on my test in the device driver, he's right. 
Thus, the possibilities I see are as follows:
- The BIOS is programming the register with the wrong value;
- The device driver is reading from a wrong address (very unlikely, in my
  opinion);
Since the first one is more "believable" (IMHO), that brings me to a
question: why does this improper programming does not happen under DOS (in
the same system), yet it does happen under Linux ??

It surely will. If the card is set to allocate a 20-bit "memory" address
(i.e., an address below 1MB), it'll crash during the driver
initialization, which would be expected.
