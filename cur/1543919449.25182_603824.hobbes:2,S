We considered that as an option but as latency.c didn't offer it I
didn't either.  
I could see the user mode interface portion of the implementation be
made as a compile time option but the kernel infrastructure will
continue to be needed by at least cpu-idel, pcm_native.c and ipw2100.
You know it could make sense to have the user mode interface part of the
patch as configurable or a build time dependent of sysfs and misc device
support for the linux-tiny guys.  Is it practical to make a linux-tiny
without the sysfs infrastructure needed to make a misc device?  I'll ask
on the linux-tiny list.
