Yep. Maybe we could have:
CPU v CPU	smp_*mb or cpu_*mb 
CPU v I/O	*mb
I/O v I/O	io_*mb
Then again before Linus hits me on the head for hoarding vowels,
http://hypermail.spyroid.com/linux-kernel/archived/2001/week41/1270.html
I should suggest we make these a little less cryptic:
CPU v CPU	cpu_{read,write,memory}_barrier
CPU v I/O	{read,write,memory}_barrier
I/O v I/O	io_{read,write,memory}_barrier

I remember some ia64 implementations have issues. Jesse, could you
fill us in again? I think you have problems with out of order
loads/stores to noncacheable space, right?
