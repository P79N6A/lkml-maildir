Hi Srivatsa,
First of all, if you're proposing this stuff for inclusion, you
should port it to the -mm tree, because I don't think Andrew
will want any other scheduler work going in just now. It wouldn't
be too hard.
I think my stuff is a bit orthogonal to what you're attempting.
And they should probably work well together. My "lazy migrate"
patch means the tasklist lock does not need to be held at all,
only the dying runqueue's lock.
