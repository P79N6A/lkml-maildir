Hi Javier, All
With 2.4.23-pre6 I'm not able to connect to the wireless lan
with the aironet 340 pcmcia card. I've not tried pre7 since it seems
there are no fixes for aironet added.
I have to use dhcpcd to get an IP but I don't get one. Ifconfig shows
that packets ar transmitted, but no single one received. There are also
a lot of errors in rx.
My wireless-tools version: 26
oh, and I have to enable WEP to access the lan.
Thanks
greets
Marc
