Subject: [PATCH] updated preemptive kernel for 2.4-ac
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

An updated preempt-kernel patch against 2.4.19-pre10-ac2 is available at
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/preempt-kernel/v2.4/preempt-kernel-rml-2.4.19-pre10-ac2-2.patch
and your favorite mirror.
The cause of this release is to make the pte_chain_lock and unlock
routines preempt-safe.  They basically are per-bit spinlocks and thus
require the standard spinlock treatment but do not receive it.
This patch also merges PPC support, to bring the supported architectures
to ARM, i386, MIPS, PPC, and SH.  This code is contributed by
MontaVista.
Finally, there is a critical fix and optimization in entry.S by George
Anzinger.
Full ChangeLog:
