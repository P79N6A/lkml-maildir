I've re-read section 9 again, and this seems correct.  You aren't locked
into the "upgrade path" unless you specify "... and any later version", or
fail to specify a version at all.
Does anyone have an historical copy of the GPL, version 1?  The copyright
dates in the GPL V2 seem to indicate it was from '89, possibly before I'd
even fully fathomed the difference between "freeware" and "shareware".

The world is moving so fast these days that the man who says it can't be
done is generally interrupted by someone doing it.
