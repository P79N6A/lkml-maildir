I believe I've already got patches for almost all of these sitting in
-mm & various subsystem trees.
Most of them will probably hit mainline during the next merge window,
so before doing a lot of duplicate work I'd suggest waiting for
2.6.24-rc1 before working on this any further - or at least check -mm
and the various maintainer/subsystem trees first.
