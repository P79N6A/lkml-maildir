    kstat should be a lighter-weight per-cpu thing.  But the current
    disk accounting in there would make it 12 kilobytes per CPU.
    My vote: remove the disk accounting from kernel_stat and use this.
I have a patch from another contributor that takes disk stats out of
kstat and puts them into their own global structure.  I'll give that
some attention.

    What are those refinements?
A couple I mentioned in my message: double collection of stats, and an
ugly hd_struct added to gendisk.  In addition, we should remove the
restriction on which and how many disks are reported on.
Lastly, a bit of a philosophical question.  /proc/stat and (with this
patch) /proc/diskstats provide some of the same information. Should
    a) all of it appear in /proc/stat?
    b) all of it appear in /proc/diskstats?
    c) keep the current (limited) info in /proc/stat (for backward
       compatibility) and introduce the expanded info in
       /proc/diskstats?
My preference is b, but I'm open to other opinions.
    What userspace tools are available for interpreting this
    information?
None that I'm aware of, although /proc/diskstats is formatted in a
program-friendly way.  Sample output (warning: wide):

Just realized as I printed this that the first field is leftover
debugging, and should be removed!
