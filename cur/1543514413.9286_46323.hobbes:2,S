Anyone know why 2.3.23 & 2.3.24 report 0K shared memory?
Perhaps this is part of the reason why 2.3.24 mysteriously ran out of
memory last night and killed sendmail, bash, and finally init.
Mem:   62812K av,  61920K used,    892K free,      0K shrd,    436K buff
Swap: 3457024K av, 540672K used, 2916352K free                 12948K cached
