.... except that the people who proposed these changes have already
suggested that these circumventions would be violations of the United
States' Digital Milllenium Copyright Act, which has rather draconoian
penalties for these "trivial circumventions".  Which is precisely why
Linus has said that if we go down this path, we are basically using
the same tactics as the RIAA and MPAA.  And why this kind of arm
twisting as "pursuasion" would be a very, VERY bad idea.
