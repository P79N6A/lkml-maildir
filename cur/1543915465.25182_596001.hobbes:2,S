I think that's fixed as a side-effect of this cleanup.  At least, it
works for me on x86-64.  Patch below: if you agree, I'll re-xmit all
three.

Well, the biggest change was the patching code getting enhanced in
2.6.22 (to cover all calls, not just 5).  The 22 -> 23 changes were
fairly trivial.
So I think 2.6.24 is a reasonable time to remove EXPERIMENTAL.

It's enabled in Ubuntu Feisty (2.6.20).

Sure, and that might well still be experimental (Jeremy?).  But that's
not CONFIG_PARAVIRT.
Hope that helps,
Rusty.

Andi points out that PARAVIRT is an option best selected when needed.
We introduce PARAVIRT_GUEST for the menu itself, and select PARAVIRT
if they ask for anything which needs it.  This also makes PARAVIRT
non-experimental.
