For something which is as already-close to CodingStyle as namespace.c it's
probably better to tidy it up by hand.  Lindent breaks almost as much stuff
as it fixes.

As Ben said.

Indenting with four spaces is a bit of a pain.  Presumably because Lindent
doesn't know what list_for_each() does.

Again.

Arguable.

Labels go in column zero.

ugh, here it went and inserted spaces.

Regression!

ug.

etc.
One approach is to run Lindent, then go through the diff and fix it up by
hand.  Then apply the patch and fix up the remaining Lindent mistakes by
hand.  But the raw output of Lindent isn't right.
