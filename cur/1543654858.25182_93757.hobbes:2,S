This is an important and complicated question.  Our code has passed an
internal IBM legal review,
however we are still discussing the implications of the patent with our
attorneys.
The best I can offer at this point is that we hope to have a definitive
answer next week.
The patent in question (US 6,298,448) deals with application-specific
dynamic scaling.
Although this is an important part of our proposal, it is not the central
idea, and I believe the
proposal has merit even if this portion were suppressed.
