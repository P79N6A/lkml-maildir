Not for a "legacy irq" it ain't.
If the ACPI layer itself decides to use IRQ0, then that's fine, and that 
path hasn't changed at all. 
However, if ACPI doesn't find any irq, and ends up just using whatever irq 
the device had for some legacy reason, then irq 0 just means "nobody set 
an irq".
Besides, we'll actually be returning 0 _anyway_. The only thing my patch
fixes (and it _is_ a fix) is that we won't be stupidly thinking that we
actually have a valid irq, and that we should turn it level-sensitive.
