Hi all,
I have some problems with the test series since test9. (except test9-bk21).
I compiled my kernel with all support that I need and it worked perfectly, 
then I had upgraded to test9 and the system won't boot, I get no error 
message on startup except the few lines from my boot loader, few days after 
that I had tried test9-bk21 and it started working again. And now test10 
fails again. Even debug and initcall_debug gaves no output.
I had tried a bit around this night and the system won't boot if I compile it 
for AMD-k6 2/3 CPUs (I have a AMD-k6 2 450), it works perfectly if I compile 
it for 386. The .config was the same for all versions I had tried.
I don't think this is a compiler problem since test8 and test9-bk21 worked. 
Anyone an idea what could cause this? Is this a known bug or s.th. similar?
My gcc version is:
gcc version 3.3.2 20031022 (Gentoo Linux 3.3.2-r2, propolice)
If you need more information please ask, I will try to get the information you 
need.
My .config is online at 
http://gutzeit.at/kernel.config
I'm using test10-bk1 at the moment.
Thanks in advance,
Jens Gutzeit
