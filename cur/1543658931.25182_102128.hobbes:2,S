Eh? In general case, to make room for newly added device, you have
to shutdown the whole PCI bus starting from level 0, reassign _all_
BARs and bridge windows and then restart...
The "hotplug resource reservation" is the only viable approach, it has
been discussed numerous times.

100% agree. :-)

I believe 1GB is a theoretical maximum for a 32-bit BAR. Everything above
that has to be 64-bit.
