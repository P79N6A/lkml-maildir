Unlikely!
But seriously, that function is so full of checks for the improbable,
that it would seem a bit odd for me to add one just for this instance:
unless you've noticed that spectacularly bad code is generated here?
I think I'd prefer to blend in with the surroundings for now, and
leave it for, say, the ACME Janitorial Services to come along and
put BUG_ON()s throughout.
