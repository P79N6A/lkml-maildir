No. The problem can be broken down into the following subproblems:
o C programmers don't believe in bounds-checking. True for most
  programmers.
o Addresses and data are stored on the same stack, making it possible to
  fool a program into thinking that data is an address. True for basically
  any modern architecture.
o Compilers trust the integrity of the stack. True for most compilers.
o The stack growns downwards, making buffer overflows with strings
  relatively common. It's possible the other way, it's just less common.
  True for most architectures.
o The stack is executable, making it possible to put exploit code to be
  directly on the stack. Stack overflows are still exploitable without
  this but it's more challenging. Meanwhile some programs rely on
  executable stacks. True for most operating systems. 
There's currently a good fix for the compiler problem known as Stackguard
which is as close to a real fix as currently exists. Patches exist to
disable execution on the stack, but exploits to bypass it have been shown.
