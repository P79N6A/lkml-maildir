I doubt it. People have said that about a million times, it has never 
gotten fixed, and I've never seen any actual proof.
I think that what got fixed was that gcc now at least re-uses stack slots 
for temporary spills. But only for things that fit in registers - not if 
you actually had variables that are big enough to be of type MEM. And the 
latter is what tends to eat stack-space (ie structures etc on stack).
But hey, maybe it really did get fixed. But the last big stack user wasn't 
that long ago, and I saw it and I have a pretty recent gcc (gcc-4.3.2 
right now, it could obviously have been slightly older back a few months 
ago).
