You must also consider that some of these RFCs mentioned are very antiquated
and don't suit today's world.  CIDR was created because of such limitations.
Using a supernet in the antiquated 'Class C' domain is quite acceptable and
necessary.  I would -very- much rather add one /17 route instead of 128 class
/24 routes.
Times change, requirements change, old standards need revised.  Otherwise
things like routing tables could be one heck of a huge mess.
