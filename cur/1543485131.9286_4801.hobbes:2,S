On my toshiba 730CDT (ct65550 video chipset) you are supposed to be
able to flip between the internal TFT display and an external monitor
using the Fn-F5 hotkey. This stopped working properly when I upgraded
to 2.0.36 or 2.2.0. 2.0.35 is fine.
When I try to flip from the external to the internal, the display is
more-or-less blank. (If I have X running, I can just barely make out
the windows if I look at it at the right angle). Also, it gets stuck
here, and I can't flip it back.
When I try to flip from internal to external, nothing happens, but
after about 10-30 minutes, the external display comes on (flipping
actually cycles from external->internal->both->external...), so it
gets stuck in "both" mode.
I've also noticed that sometimes display blanking comes on all by
itself. That is to say that I disable it in Windoze, but after a day
or so running linux, it starts blanking by itself (this was in 2.2.0).
Hoping someone can help, or at least point me at the right part of the 
kernel.
Here's my config from 2.0.36 and 2.2.0
