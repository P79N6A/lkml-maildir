read side is taken in the slow path.
write side is taken in the fast path.
pagefault is fast path, VM during swapping is slow path.

The only possible overhead that a rw semaphore could ever generate vs
a rw lock is overscheduling.

Yes, that's the positive side, the negative side is that you'll put
the task in uninterruptible sleep and call schedule() and require a
wakeup, because a list_add taking <1usec is running in the
other cpu. No other downside. But that's the only reason it's a
spinlock right now, infact there can't be any other reason.
