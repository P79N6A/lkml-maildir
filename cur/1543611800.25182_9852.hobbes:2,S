My 2.4.8 tree seems to disagree with the doc:
find . -name \*[ch] | xargs fgrep nmi_watchdog | grep =
./arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:int nmi_watchdog = 0;
./arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:__setup("nmi_watchdog=", setup_nmi_watchdog);
./arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:           nmi_watchdog = 0;

Let's hope Mr Murphy took some vacation and please give a try at 
append="nmi_watchdog=1".

The console code differs a lot. Trace would help.
