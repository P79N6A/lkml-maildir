Gettting the severity of an RTAS event is possible, and not too 
difficult.  Check out asm-ppc64/rtas.h for a definition of the
RTAS event header (struct rtas_error_log).  All RTAS events have the 
same initial header containing the severity of the event.
Decoding RTAS events beyond the intial header, that gets ugly quick and 
will hopefully never need to be done in the kernel.
