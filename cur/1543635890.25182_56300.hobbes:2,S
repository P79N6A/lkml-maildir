This is a very presumptuous statement! You cannot assume that an 
alternative interface would be of lousy quality. Maybe it is a million 
times better? The current one (at least as some drives implement it on the 
drive side) can be of very, very poor quality indeed.
Note: I am not saying that there is an alternative interface or anything 
like that... just that your statement is fallacious.
Best regards,
