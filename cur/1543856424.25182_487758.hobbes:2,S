My main reasoning for doing this was that the structures involved are 
per-superblock. There is virtually no reason that a filesystem would 
ever need to touch these structures in another filesystem.
So, this is essentially a service to make it easy for filesystems to 
implement i_ino uniqueness. I'm not terribly interested in making things 
easier for proprietary filesystems, so I don't see a real reason to make 
this available to them. They can always implement their own scheme to do 
this.
I'm certainly open to discussion though. Is there a compelling reason to 
open this up to proprietary software authors?
