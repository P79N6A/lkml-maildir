sata_nv is just now receiving suspend/resume support in devel tree. 
2.6.19 sata_nv doesn't have it and STD might have worked but I wouldn't 
be surprised if it doesn't work from time to time or gets broken due to 
unrelated changes in kernel.  So, IO errors after STD are bad but kind 
of expected.  I dunno what went wrong with your fs after such IO errors. 
  Destroyed fs after some IO errors is pretty extreme tho.
So, my 5 cents is... don't do hibernation till 2.6.20 is out.
