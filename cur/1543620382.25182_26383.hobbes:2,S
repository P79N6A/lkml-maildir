Loading the ppa module causes a kernel oops... apparently it causes some 
trouble for the interrupt handler.  It is a bit difficult to provide the 
  oops here since it freezes the entire machine, but I will try to break
my test box with this later today.
I am running 2.5 on an Intel PIII.
Affected kernels:
Linux 2.5.4-pre2  (and probably 2.5.3 and 2.5.4-pre1 since these both
                    have Evgeniy Polyakov's updates to "various SCSI
                    drivers to new locking" which includes ppa.c)
Who is maintaining the linux iomega stuff?
