yes, even SCHED_IDLE tasks get some CPU time - so complete starvation 
should not be possible. We dont really want to define the exact amount 
of time they need. (we might want to change that in the future) But it 
will always be less prio than nice +19 :-) You can think of it as if it 
was "nice +30".

they get equal share.
you can try it out too: if you have 2.6.23 or newer kernels then just 
pick up schedtool and use "schedtool -I" to run SCHED_IDLE tasks.
