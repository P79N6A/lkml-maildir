First reaction is that this is very reasonable.  I can see why you need
to do this as you don't have DISCONTIGMEM.  I will just go check the
major architectures and make sure they arn't relying on being able to
enable SPARSEMEM and getting FLATMEM too behaviour.  I don't think they
can be as they all have DISCONTIGMEM and so should be insulated.
