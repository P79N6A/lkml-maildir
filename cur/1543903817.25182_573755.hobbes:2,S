"I" is correct.  The Intel documentation on this is highly confusing
(and has bugs in it), but it does unambiguously state:
"Some assemblers support immediate bit offsets larger than 31 by using
the immediate bit offset field in combination with the displacement
field in the memory operand ... The processor will ignore the high-order
bits if they are not zero."  AMD processors might be different for all I
know.
So unless gas is capable of doing this transformation (and it's not as
of binutils-2.17.50.0.6) "I" is what's needed here.
