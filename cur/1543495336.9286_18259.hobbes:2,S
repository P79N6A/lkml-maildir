I have my field-bus-card (mcat/bitbus) up and running (as far as
hardware-configuration and detection is concerned) and want to implement
the fieldbus-protocol now.
Of cause I want to use the kernel's infrastructure for queueing of
packages and stuff. But for the ease of coding I want to have the
protocol implemented in a library in user-space. I want the
kernel-driver to just receive and transmit the packages. How can I
implement the hooks for passing the packages up to user-land and process
them further?
Untill now I used the ethernet setup stuff. But since my card uses (kind
of) RS485-serial protocol I will have to change that, too. 
what do I need to watch out for if I want to ensure that I can do mcat
over tcp/tp later? or is this just to much for now?
