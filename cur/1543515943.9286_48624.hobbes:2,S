Excellent. This is, IMNSHO, exactly how crash dumps should be done on
the x86 architecture. I've tried a similar approach a few years ago,
using LILO to do the saving. If you can get all this done reliably
without special support from the boot loader, that's even better.
(BTW, my attempts failed miserably, because I didn't know how prevent
the BIOS to clear memory.)
