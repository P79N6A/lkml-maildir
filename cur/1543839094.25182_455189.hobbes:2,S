If you mean user memory, then it is possible to set
container limits to 4,5GB. This is what most people care about
and it is not a problem.
Or you mean that you are suprised there are lots of parameters
and there is no a single one limiting the _whole_ memory set of container
memory (sum of kernel memory, user space memory and other resources memory)?

why do you assume that it is always an operator who controls the applications
inside the container?
users can run any application inside and it is systems job to
introduce resource isolation between users, not the operators full-time
job doing monitoring of users.

yep, this is possible with page beancounters as it tracks user pages.
more over, we have an intention of building a system with a single container
memory parameter, but we think this is more user interface question and
still requires all the UBC resources accounting.
