possible, but was kinda a compelling equation for us, the most recent
generation of our network attached storge for grants I work on was 1.8TB
(24 drives after you subtract loseing about 1/8 to  parity disks and the
three hot spares) for less than $8000(for the whole machine) using the
100GB maxtor 536dx's.
if I have to do it again with scsi, using 73GB u160 disks, it'll cost me
something like $24,000 just for the disk (using the same assumptions as
with the ide setup we get 32 drives) which is kinda out of my price range.
It cost more than $8K for the hp tape robot that provides us with
backup...
