Saving a line over readability is utterly bogus.
Just look at some of the crap we have in devfs..
    if (fs_info->devfsd_task == NULL) return (TRUE);
    if (devfsd_queue_empty (fs_info) && fs_info->devfsd_sleeping) return TRUE;
    if ( is_devfsd_or_child (fs_info) ) return (FALSE);
    set_current_state (TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
    add_wait_queue (&fs_info->revalidate_wait_queue, &wait);
    if (!devfsd_queue_empty (fs_info) || !fs_info->devfsd_sleeping)
        if (fs_info->devfsd_task) schedule ();
    remove_wait_queue (&fs_info->revalidate_wait_queue, &wait);
    __set_current_state (TASK_RUNNING);
    return (TRUE);
*horror* to my eyes at least.
Parts of the DRI code use similar uglies.  Whitespace is a *good* thing.
If you want more lines of code per screen, get a larger xterm, change a
font, whatever, but don't decrease code readability for something so bogus.
