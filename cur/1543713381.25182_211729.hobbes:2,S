When you say mount, does that mean smbfs?
2.4.25 allows you to enable the cifs unix extensions in smbfs. Perhaps
turning those off makes a difference?
The other change is that smbfs in 2.4.25 has large file support. smbfs in 
2.4.24 should behave like 2.4.22.

smbmount is only a mount tool, it does not transfer any other data.
