Shouldn't it be a matter of stability though? Benchmarks suggest that 
reiser4 is a good file system; reiser4 is the successor to the 
already-accepted reiserfs; we've got experimental ext4 support but no 
reiser4 support, etc.
I don't see why something like plugins should matter. If it works enough 
to be marked as experimental, why shouldn't reiser4 support be included?
It's a pain for me personally to have to patch any kernel with reiser4 
support so I can use the reiser4 fs.
