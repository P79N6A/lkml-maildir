Do you have a reference?
rwlocks are a bit funny, because if they are found to be useful (that
is, they get used somewhere), then it indicates there can be situations
with a lot of contention and spinning.
Wheras we usually prefer not to use spinlocks in situations like that.
Not that I'm claiming the contended case doesn't matter, but I think
problems there indicate a bug (and I think rwlocks are almost always
questionable).
Anyway, I'll look at doing some contended case optimisations afterward.

I'd hate to have a proliferation of lock types though. I think my
queued spinlock addresses a real hardware limitation of some systems.
In situations where contention isn't a problem, then queued locks won't
cause a slowdown. In situations where it is, starvation could also be
a problem.
