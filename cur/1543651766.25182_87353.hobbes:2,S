Thanks Phil, unfortunately, this doesnt solve my problem.
The 5.x driver never worked for me on the 2940u2w, it lock the computer.
I could even trigger the kernel message with no devices attached to the scsi bus.
With the two adapters in the computer, when I issue a scsiadd -s 1, I've got the
errors but whithout  the hard lock.
For reference:

Is someone knew something about my pblm with the pci latency timer set to 0 ?
Emmanuel.
