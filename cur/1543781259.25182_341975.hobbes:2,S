I hope this is the right place to ask. My apologise if it's wrong.
I have found 2.4.25-low-latency.patch.gz for the 2.4.25 kernel but I 
couldn't find preemptible patch for this version of kernel.
I found preempt-kernel-rml-2.4.23-pre5-1.patch and 
preempt-kernel-rml-2.4.26-pre5-1.patch which are pretty close but not 
exactly for the same version.
Could anybody please help me with this.
Thank you
Dmytro
