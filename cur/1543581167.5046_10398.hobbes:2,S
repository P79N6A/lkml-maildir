Umm, and if you want the separate higher-level IOs to be told which
IOs succeeded and which ones failed on error, you need to associate
each of the multiple completion callbacks with its particular
scatter-gather fragment or fragments.  So you end up with the same
sort of kiobuf/kiovec concept where you have chains of sg chunks, each
chunk with its own completion information.
This is *precisely* what I've been trying to get people to address.
Forget whether the individual sg fragments are based on pages or not:
if you want to have IO merging and accurate completion callbacks, you
need not just one sg list but multiple lists each with a separate
callback header.
Abandon the merging of sg-list requests (by moving that functionality
into the higher-level layers) and that problem disappears: flat
sg-lists will then work quite happily at the request layer.
Cheers,
 Stephen
