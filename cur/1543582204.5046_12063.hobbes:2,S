Known problem.                                                                  
                                                                                
Go                                                                              
                                                                                
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/people/axboe
                                     
                                                                                
and take the latest loop-? patch from there. Let Jens Axboe know if it works    
or if you still have problems. Particularry, if you can reliably reproduce      
the problem you referred.
                                                                                
I hear the patch should get merged to 2.4.1ac soon.

And, your address zole@diamondhead.hesbynett.no does not work. I'm kinda
puzzled about how you expect people to reply you. With smoke signals?
