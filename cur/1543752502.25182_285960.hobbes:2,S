Devils-advocate:  Who is on the vendor-sec list?  as I have started
devloping a roll your own linux dsitro (as 100s of other have as well) who
decides who is "approved" to hear about the fixes beforehand-what makes
SuSE, and Red Hat more deserving than Bonzai) User Base?

the rest is mostly politics.
