That's a different issue and actually okay in this case.
What I meant to show is an example where the compiler happens to
allocate the variables in sequence, and where it could access them
either by referencing each by absolute address, with relocation (so
that objdump-patcher could change that), or by generating a pointer
and using pointer-relative addressing or pointer increment (so we
only get one relocation and never know what may go wrong with the
other variables).
