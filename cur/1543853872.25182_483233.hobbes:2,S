Increased buffer sizes can actually paradoxically make the situation
worse. Van Jacobson once claimed that those who do not understand TCP are
doomed to re-invent it.
If you have a very controlled environment then there are alternative flow
control approaches including counting approaches when you know the
underlying transport is basically reliable (or you can tolerate minor
loss). That's roughly speaking the equivalent of TCP with fixed windows
and knowing that the buffering worst cases are the end points.
