As an *implementation* constraint, I might agree ... so
long as it's easily changed later.
As an *interface* constraint, I don't ... interfaces are
rarely easy to change.
However, in terms of implementation, most gpio chips have
primitives that work in terms of bitmasks rather than any
kind of start/length primitive.  Example:
 - To set bits in "u32 mask":
	iowrite32(mask, bank_base + SET_REG)
 - To clear bits in "u32 mask"
	iowrite32(mask, bank_base + CLR_REG)
 - To read bits in "u32 mask",
	return mask & ioread32(bank_base + VALUE_REG)
In short, start/length looks most like a policy, of the
"keep them out of interfaces!" flavor, than something
appropriate for an interface.  As noted above, gpio_chip
interfaces would more naturally use masks.
