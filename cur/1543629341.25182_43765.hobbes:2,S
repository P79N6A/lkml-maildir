Hi all.
Kernel 2.4.18 smbfs worked, 2.4.19-pre8 smbfs worked (although 
fs/ufs/super.c had some missing commas), 2.5.11 smbfs didn't work.  The 
RedHat 7.2 had samba-2.2.1a-4 so I pulled down samba-2.2.3a-4 from the 
skipjack beta and compiled it under kernel 2.5.11 and it mounts windows 
shares correctly.  I'm in the process of going to 2.5.13 but I'm going 
to stick with the 2.2.3a-4 samba.
Thanks for all of your help.
