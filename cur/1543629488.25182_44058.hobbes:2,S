Right.  If khttpd had been pulled from 2.4.17, I would have
had weeks of warning that khttpd is unstable; instead, I learned
only when someone started doing his own stress testing, and I
have little time to fix it.  I say pull it from
2.4.19-pre9.  Marcello, put it out of its misery asap, please...
it'd time for khttpd to become a standalone patch again.
