Seems to. First time it booted okay, but wouldn't let me log in (worse 
than -mm), I got the following:

Second time it didn't boot properly, with a similar oops to the others.
I used the following config for 2.6.18-rc1, which should be very similar, but 
not identical.

I'm about to try a kernel without the lockdep stuff, then I'm going to start 
bisection pain.
