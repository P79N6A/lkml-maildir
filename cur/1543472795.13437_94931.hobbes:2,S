There is a fine line between respect and worship.
Yes, Richard M. Stallman certainly did a great deal of VERY useful 
things for the open software community, but this does certainly not
mean he has all the answers.
On a personal level, I use Linux and OpenBSD --- not Hurd.
and I use vim --- not emacs.   I'm following perhaps half of gnu coding
standards, I DON'T always write GPL'ed code, though I do contribute,
I'm very grateful for egcs, binutils, and numerous other GNU tools...
Not so grateful for some of gnu-make's `improvements', which I have to code
around more often than not, and I MUCH prefer perl to guile.
I think that most people writing & reading linux-kernel are perfectly able
to make their own mind for themselves.  We all know that linux is a KERNEL,
almost completely independent from GNU proper.
RMS may insist upon GNU/Linux all he wants---it's his right, but the very
way GPL is written means we don't have to humor him.
Putting a sticker saying that a Linux distribution is shock-full of gnu-tools
is fine. Indeed, the FSF could probably get most commercial distributions to
display such a sticker.  Wanting to call the kernel `GNU' is plain ludicrous.
Now, can we please put that flamewar to rest and go back to serious kernel
hacking.
