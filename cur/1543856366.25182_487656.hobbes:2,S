But the suggested patch does not do this.

The patch replaces the DSDT with the binary from initramfs in the same
acpi_os_table_override() function as the currently available
CONFIG_ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT does:

 #endif
 	return AE_OK;
 }
However, this patch slightly changes initialization order of some
kernel parts:
 - The call to populate_rootfs() is moved before calls to
   smp_prepare_cpus(max_cpus), do_pre_smp_initcalls(), smp_init(),
   sched_init_smp() and cpuset_init_smp().
 - The call to acpi_early_init() is moved from start_kernel() (where
   it is done just before rest_init()) to rest_init(), where it is now
   preceded by lock_kernel(), set_cpus_allowed(current, CPU_MASK_ALL),
   child_reaper = current and the moved populate_rootfs().
Not sure if this reordering is safe in theory, but it works for many
users of the patch.
