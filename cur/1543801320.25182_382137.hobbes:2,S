It's documented in Documentation/DocBook/deviceiobook.tmpl.  If the 
documentation isn't clear, we should fix it, rather than avoid using the 
primitive altogether.  If drivers/net really means mmiowb() in some 
places, we should change it, and like you said maybe get rid of some of 
these primitives so that their usage is clearer.
