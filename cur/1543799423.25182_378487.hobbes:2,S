Subject: [patch 6/9] mutex subsystem, switch ARM to use the xchg based implementation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/22/76

as noted by Nicolas Pitre, atomic_[inc/dec]_call_if_[nonpositive/negative]()
atomic methods are slow on ARM, because they can only be implemented via
disabling interrupts. So tell the mutex code that we prefer atomic_xchg().
[ we still pull in asm-generic/atomic-call-if.h, so that they remain
  generally available primitives - even though unused on ARM at the
  moment. ]
