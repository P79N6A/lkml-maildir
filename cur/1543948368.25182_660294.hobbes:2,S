The driver got one error : "nv_adma_check_cpb: CPB 0, flags=0x11". The
code entered ata_port_abort -> ata_qc_complete
-> fill_result_tf->nv_adma_tf_read.
Firstly, nv_adma_register_mode failed, showing the below messages:
timeout waiting for ADMA IDLE, stat=0x440
timeout waiting for ADMA LEGACY, stat=0x440
Then enter ata_tf_read function. 
I found the system hung at tf->hob_nsect = ioread8(ioaddr->nsect_addr);
Sometimes the screen showed "
CPU0: Machin check Exception 0000000000000004
Bank 4:b200000000070f0f
kernel panic -not syncing: CPU Context corrupt.
"
If nv_adma_register_mode failed, the reg result should be not
meaningful. 
I don't know why the systm hung.
