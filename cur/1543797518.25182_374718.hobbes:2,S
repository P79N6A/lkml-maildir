How much overhead would there be?

On my box the SRAT for hot-add areas exposed are from the end
installed memory to way out in outerspace.
SRAT: hot plug zone found 280000000 - 2300000000
I can't hot add that sort of range on my box but the bios didn't want
to limit or is planing for really really big dimms.
I wouldn't want to waste resource for areas that will never be added.
Thanks,
 Keith
