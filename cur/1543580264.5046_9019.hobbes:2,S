Ah.. thanks for the clarification.  Is this duplication "hard" or "soft"?  
i.e. under low-memory conditions, do these duplicated pages actually reduce 
the hard limit of VM available, or just imply that using that last bit of 
memory will entail greater paging overhead (because it has to do more cleanup)?
Does this mean that having a swap partition less than or equal to RAM is now 
effectively pointless?
