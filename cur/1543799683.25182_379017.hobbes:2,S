Yes, absolutely.

Note that by "insane users" I didn't mean the end-user sitting in front of 
the machine, but the actual _program_ (ie X) that does uses the kernel in 
insane ways.
So no need to check in at the asylym.
And yes, as X seems to have a sane fallback, we can definitely avoid my 
"allow insanity" patch. Much better to return an error for insane uses 
than to try to support them when there's no need.
Thanks for testing,
		Linus
