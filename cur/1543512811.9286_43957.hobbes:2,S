Hello Christoph,
> Subject says it: Can I resize a vmalloced area without copying?
It's possible, but it hasn't been done.  Generally, the use of vmalloc is
strongly discouraged for anything other than occasional allocation of
large virtually contiguous memory areas.  If possible, rework your code to
manage its own sparsely populated buffer.
