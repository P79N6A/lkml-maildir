Didn't the distribution already come with pre-compiled drivers?

So you installed the distribution on hardware it did not support. How
is that the kernel's problem? Go talk to Novell about that.

That's not easy. Agreed. But, that's hardly the kernels problem.
That's your problem for trying to install a distribution on
non-supported hardware. One could also argue that its your problem for
buying hardware without open drivers available.

Complain to the vendor of that hardware. Ask them to either continue
supporting the OS you are using or open source the drivers.
How can that ever be anything but an issue between you and your hardware vendor?

Well, you for one claimed you were a user, and I would say almost
anyone who doesn't hack the kernel or wants to test it falls into the
user category.

Indeed. It is your problem. You bought hardware not supported by Open
Source drivers so noone on LKML can help you with that - only vendor
of the closed source driver can help you. To buy that hardware was
your choice, hence it it is your problem, we can agree on that.

That's between the vendor and their customers. The vendor made a
choice only to release closed source drivers and the customer made a
choice to purchase hardware only supported by closed source drivers.
That can never be anything but the vendor and customers problem.
