I vaguely remember, but I don't think this creates a maintenance
issue .. It's not related to maintenance , it's an issue of creating a
new clocksource .. My perspective is that it has even less an effect
than the CLOCK_SOURCE_IS_CONTINUOUS field .. People actually have to
research that field, but list initialization is fairly clear.
The majority method for creating these clocksources is copy&paste, so
I'm not sure nano argument on this subject particularly relevant ..
