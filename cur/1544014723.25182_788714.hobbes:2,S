My concern is that completely broken cards may be able to get away with more
if the timeout is extended. There is clearly a tradeoff here between
supporting non-conforming cards and easily detecting broken cards.
Someone suggested to me off list that having a configuration option to
enable/disable the longer timeout is a good compromise, and I agree.
