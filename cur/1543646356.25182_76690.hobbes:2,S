Hi,
I have a basic question. When some function calls
panic:
1)Can I store some registers into nonvolatile 
memory. I will call this function from the very
beginning of my panic function.
2) What exactly happens when a function calls panic
.i.e. a)what all things are inaccessible, in my 
case I will be embedding my code at the very beginning
of panic function, so what things will be inaccessible
to my code b) what is control flow after a function
calls panic.
Any help will really useful. Kindly mail to
venkatraghu2002@yahoo.com, as I did't subscribe.
Regards
Venkat.
