Hi all,
The Mach64 driver in the FrameBuffer device produces a consistant error
with my ATI All-In-Wonder Pro (PCI), which is based on a "Rage Pro" Mach
64 chip. Adding an extra 4 meg of memory to the card does not affect it.
I have not got a native 8 meg AIW-Pro to test it with. My machine is a
k6-2-300, with 128 meg of DIMMS in an Iwill Super7 motherboard,
operating at a bus speed of 66MHz.
When the kernel is booted, for almost half a second, plain text mode is
visible, then the screen switches to graphics mode (I can not tell what
resolution, aside from that it is very high res.), and turns mostly
light green, with thin stripes of black, with a single red border on the
right hand edge of this.
ASCII Art version, just to make it clearer(?)

I really hope that comes out right. I'm at work, using a non-Linux
e-mail client. I won't name any names because I don't want to give
Microsoft Outlook a bad name.
The overall length of the green-black-red combination is about 1 inch,
and I hope it's important after the amount of space I've just devoted to
it.
Once this has happened, I can not tell whether the machine carries on
booting, or is waiting for something. I suspect that it has crashed
completely, or is waiting for some kind of input, judging form the lack
of HDD activity. The power switch does not work with a single press,
however holding the switch for 5 seconds does shut the machine down.
A suggestion for future kernels:
If the power button single press can be detected, then alert init to
this fact, so that it can run "shutdown -h now" or something similar.
Keep up the good work.
