These proper text encodings are easy to _apply_, because the raw email is 
uncorrupted. 
However, attachments are still broken for a very fundamental reason: 
basically no email client will ever quote them on replies. Which means 
that if somebody has commentary about some specific part of the patch, the 
attachement is _totally_ the wrong thing to do.
In other words, there's a reason I encourage people VERY STRONGLY to use 
in-line patches. If you have a broken mailer that corrupts whitespace, 
please just fix it.
