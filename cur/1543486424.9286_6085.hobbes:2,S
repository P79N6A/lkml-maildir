Your problem is you have to tell the kernel that the rootfs is compressed.
Ie:
          bits  0-10:     Offset to start of ramdisk, in 1024 byte blocks
          bits 11-13:     unused
          bit     14:     Flag indicating that ramdisk is to be loaded
          bit     15:     Flag indicating to prompt before loading rootfs
To use this:
	rdev -r kernelgoeshere valueascalculated
Read the Bootdisk-HOWTO for a more detailed description.
