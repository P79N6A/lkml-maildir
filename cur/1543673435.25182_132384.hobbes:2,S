Yep.
speaking of which - let me know when you want the next round of patches
to remove the ARM26 stuff from arch/arm please ;-)

Yep. the [compiled size of the] kernel has already begun to decrease,
and its looking quite promising (If I ever get the time to finish it!)
I just want to get it 'out there' so the couple of other folks
interested can start hacking on it too.
I have an ide driver too, if anyone wants to submit it for the
mainstream kernel. It drives SIMTEC IDE cards, found in Acorn machines,
and is, of course, non-invasive to the tree. Its for 2.4. I'd imagine
Russell would be happy to let someone else take it off his hands?
