Runs very well here on a (noname) laptop, even with apic timer, the
desktop does not "feel" different from static 1000HZ.  But dtck
reproducibly breaks software-suspend2; the kernel will simply stall on
resume.  Also stalls with dyntick=noapic.  As soon as I set
CONFIG_NO_IDLE_HZ = n, resume works again.
My kernel is 2.6.13-rc5 + swsusp-2.1.9.11 + dtck-3, the system is a
Mitac 8375 laptop, via chipset, mobile athlon xp, gcc-3.4.4

Jim
