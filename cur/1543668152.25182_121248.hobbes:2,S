This statement is utterly ridiculous, considering that the poster is
having problems with the eepro100 driver.  It is obviously, provably
_NOT_ solid.
In Red Hat's experience, some people find eepro100 very stable for
them, some people find e100 very stable for them.  There is no driver
which is 100% stable for all people at all times.
