Here comes what I've found so far fro single Athlon XP on Linux.
http://www.linuxhardware.org/features/01/10/09/1514233.shtml
Summary and thanks for your fast replies:
All Athlons/Durons except the first SlotA ones (Athlon I; 0,25 µm; no apic; 
no available boards) support SMP. I know it before from the docs...;-)
But "only" the "latest" Athlon MP/XP (Palomino core) and Duron (Morgan core, 
based on the Palomino core) support it "very" well. This is due to the 
enhanced TLBs and cache redesign.
Only difference between Athlon MP vs XP is that the first is "validate" for 
SMP.
So any dual numbers? I know that Paul G. Allen would upgrade his Tyan Thunder 
K7 dual 1.4 GHz TB Athlon to an dual Athlon XP.
Greetings,
	Dieter
