Hmm, it seems to me, that all meta-data relating to the file fsync() was
called on should be sent to the disk and waited for by the call.

Can you be sure the MTA wasn't calling sync() just to be sure (Many MTAs are
funny in that they think the spool is on a seperate disk and filesystem).
fsync() shouldn't be flushing anything not relating to the file it was
called on (that includes directory entries related to the file also IMHO).
Also, if the MTA wasn't running as root, it shouldn't be able to make sync()
affect the entire system.  Is there anything that says that sync() can't
just flush the user's buffers unless you're running as root or with some
CAP_ capability?
