Why can't the s390 code also be converted?  If it was, do you mean that
the ioctl() and direct_ioctl() callbacks can be removed?

Why is s390 special?  Shouldn't it use the same interface the rest of
the block devices use?

So some upper layer code determines which kind of ioctl this is, and
sends the data to direct_ioctl() or ioctl()?  I can understand trying to
handle the "generic block device ioctls" but being forced to parse them
yourself seems like a loosing job.
Again, I really recommend getting rid of any new ioctls, and use either
driverfs or your own fs.

In the end, everything is a "logical" representation :)
Driverfs exports the in-kernel representation of the device tree, so
that would fit perfectly with your logical representation.  As this is
the main reason for having driverfs, I'm very reluctant to see new
chunks of code added to the kernel that tries to implement this in their
own "custom" way.  In this case, you are doing this through ioctls, and
your /proc interface.  Both of these should be converted.
If you have any implementation questions about the driver model, and
driverfs, please feel free to ask.
