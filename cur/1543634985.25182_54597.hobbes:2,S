First of all, it's dead ugly. usb-storage crashes if the scheduler is 
overloaded. IMHO that's a bug, especially since it's simple to avoid it.
And what about storage_disconnect()?
Test case: user pulls out the usb cable while a transfer is in progress. 
urb submitted to the device, reply not yet received.
Result: storage_disconnect() would hang for 20 seconds until 
command_abort() is called.
I've fixed that by adding usb_stor_abort_transport() into 
storage_disconnect(). But that means that abort_transport() could run in 
the window between queuecommand() and the scheduling of the worker thread.
Read through my proposal: With current_urb_sem [I've called it urb_sem, 
but it's the same concept], the synchronization between abort and new 
commands is guaranteed.
The only difference is that I've moved testing ->abort_cmd and 
down(&->urb_sem) into usb_stor_msg_common: Requesting that the callers 
must acquire the semaphore and check abort_cmd() is unnecessary code 
duplication and just asks for bugs.

Could you explain a bit more? How could the pointer become invalid?

You are right.
That leaves one problem: a real disconnect in the middle of 
host_reset(), i.e. after checking us->bitflags or reading pusb_dev.
It should be possible to handle that case, too: usb_device structures 
are refcounted.

My version is shorter ;-)
usb_stor_CBI_irq() containes 2 independent parts: only part only for 
command aborts, one part for normal interrupts. By splitting the 
function several lines of exception handling became unnecessary.
