makes sense, but are you sure having distros like Debian, enterprise
products from redhat etc using the same 6months release for their
stable versions does not translate in minor fragmentation on kernel
development and in benefits for every user?
Under this light i think a 6months cycle starts to mean something when
stable distros gets older and older (debian and redhat enterprise are
released every 18/24 months) and developers and who wants bleeding
edge features can always use Fedora, openSUSE, Gentoo etc. Another
advantage would be to benefit external projects and hardware producers
writing open drivers, enlowering the effort in writing and mantaining
a driver.
