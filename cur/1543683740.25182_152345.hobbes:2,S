It would seem to me that the lower limit for a given CPU is a function of
CPU speed and cache size. One reason for longer slices is to preserve the
cache, but the real time to get good use from the cache is not a constant,
and you just can't pick any one number which won't be too short on a slow
cpu or unproductively long on a fast CPU. Hyperthreading shrinks the
effective cache size as well, but certainly not by 2:1 or anything nice.
Perhaps this should be a tunable set by a bit of hardware discovery at
boot and diddled at your own risk. Sure one factor in why people can't
agree on HZ and all to get best results.
