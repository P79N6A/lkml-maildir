Nope, no similar reports. But I'm listening. :)

Quoting your message:
# There are two things I did with the filesystem which may be related to
# this: First, on Oct. 27 I did resize the filesystem (umount, lvextend,
# e2fsck -f, resize2fs, mount). But after that I did several reboots
# without any problems - this is my notebook and I turn it on and off
# several times a day.
First of all, you having resized your fs is a smoking gun, if you ask 
me. Your fs is dead/dying, and you know you've recently been tinkering 
with it. It's the most probable cause.
Secondly, I think that your resize sequence is missing an e2fsck -f 
after resize2fs. Resizing filesystems is risky business, and I've ruined 
many a filesystem by resizing them. Even when it came clean out of an 
fsck. I'm also worried that there was apparently _never_ a full fsck 
after the resize2fs -- seeing as all the subsequent fscks were probably 
done by journal. That way, any existing problem can stay in existence 
and slowly "creep" into more and more of your files as you modify them.

This sounds like your filesystem's block bitmaps are "fscked up". These 
problems can definitely cause "creeping corruption" when undetected, 
because (a) new files overwrite existing files only part of the time 
(especially if your filesystem has a relatively large amount of free 
space, as it probably does because you just resized it), and (b) you 
don't actually use most of your files very often, so you usually don't 
really notice it until it's too late.
Also, AFAIK the journal is simply a special file as far as ext3 is 
concerned, and perhaps the journal corruption you experienced has to do 
with that special file's bits being marked free, and the beginning of 
the journal being overwritten by other data.
DISCLAIMER: I'm biased. I almost lost a filesystem to this exact problem 
once. It was ext2resize, not resize2fs. But still.
About the laptop mode hypothesis: I think it's just a coincidence. If 
it's not, then it could be a "sync-time-only" problem (because what 
laptop mode does before spindown is a sync), but not a specific laptop 
mode problem -- laptop mode doesn't influence block numbers whatsoever. 
  But if it were a sync problem, we would be seeing a lot more reports 
of corruption. For now my vote is with the resize. :)
