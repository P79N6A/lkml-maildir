I'm not convinced we need a new module for each container.  The module
is a policy enforcement engine, so give it a container aware policy and
you shouldn't need another module.

There's two primary security areas here.  One is container level
isolation, which is the job of the container itself.  Security modules
can effectively introduce containers, but w/out any notion of a virtual
environment (easy example, uts).  With namespaces you get isolation w/out
any formal access control check, you simply can't find objects that aren't
in your namespace.  The second is object level isolation (objects such
as files, processes, etc), standard access control checks that should
happen within a container.  This can be handled quite naturally by the
security module.

This is a question of visibility.  One method of containment is via
LSM.  This checks all object access against a label that's aware of
container ids to disallow inter-container, well, anything.  However,
if a namespace would mean you simply can't find those other processes,
then there's no need for the LSM side except for intra-container.

Right, and that's doable as a single top-level policy.  It's a bit
interesting when you want to be able to specifiy policy from within a
container (e.g. virtual hosting), granted.

Yes, although the networking area was something that looked better done
via namespaces (at least that's my recollection of my conversations with
Serge on that one a few years back).
