The latest drop of JFS was made available today.
The file system has fixes included. Also, the utilities have
been cleaned up to use standard types.
In the file system the following problems have been fixed.
- Fix for assert(iagp->wmap[extno] & mask); (line #2875) in jfs_imap
  while running dbench
- Fixed hang on scsi
- added /proc/fs/jfs/jfsFYI (2.4.* kernels only)
     echo 1 > /proc/fs/jfs/jfsFYI  ; Turns on very verbose output to syslog
     echo 0 > /proc/fs/jfs/jfsFYI  ; Turns it back off
For more details about the problems fixed, please see the README.
