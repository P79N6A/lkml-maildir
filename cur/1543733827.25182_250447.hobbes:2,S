It's up to you.  Andrew pulls several BitKeeper trees into his -mm tree, 
so you could do both if you wished.  If you do that, though, just make 
sure that the code you push is in a state that's ready for review and 
testing :)

I usually create a new "patch queue" for experimental features, to make 
sure that (a) it's seperated from the main testing branch but (b) it's 
easy to merge it back into the main testing branch when it's ready.  If 
you use BitKeeper, this is accomplished simply by creating another 
cloned repository.
