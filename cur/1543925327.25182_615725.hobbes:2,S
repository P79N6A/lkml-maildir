Digging through the module loader I found what triggers the error...
CPU0 (sys_init_module for qdio)			CPU1 (sys_init_module for qeth)
mutex_lock()
-> load_module()
     mod->state = COMING
mutex_unlock()
						mutex_lock()
init().......takes some time			load_module()
						-> resolve_symbols()
						   -> use_module()
						      -> stong_try_module_get() bails out
							 because state == COMING
						-> simplify_symbols() complains with the warning
mutex_lock()
mod->state = LIVE
mutex_unlock()
So is it correct that sys_init_module() is called for qeth even if qdio is
not yet in MODULE_STATE_LIVE?
