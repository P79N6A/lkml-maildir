That's what I don't know.  like I said, the xtime seqlock seemed to be
implicated, but I've never managed to trace it down.
I also notice that under heavy load the system starts to lose time (at
least according to ntp).  I suspect there's something wrong with the PIT
timer routine (since that's what voyager has to use) for adding lost
ticks.
