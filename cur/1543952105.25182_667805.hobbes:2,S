On second look, your actually break even on size (if not a little worse)
cause you adding some addition code into the macro which effectively
inlines it at all the likely/unlikely locations .. I'm not sure that's
really necessary .. 
Also by not including the file name you have situation like the
following,
+unlikely |   208324|  4010128| do_sys_open+0x2a/0xb2()@:34
Where do_sys_open is on line 1076 in file fs/open.c , but the likely
location is actual on like 34 in file include/linux/err.h ..
So I think saving of the EIP does help in finding the actually caller,
but I do think we loose something by removing the file name..
