According to Andrey it didn't, but since Linus you are talking about not 
breaking userspace, without this patch many userspace applications and 
scripts are broken so at least can we put this in 2.6.15.1 ? It doesn't make 
any sense when you leave userspace broken obviously ( there is a bugzilla 
entry and a ready patch ) and talking about userspace compatibility at the 
same time.
