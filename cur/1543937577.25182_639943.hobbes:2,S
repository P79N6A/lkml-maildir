Subject: [PATCH] (*revised*) Fix IXANY and restart after signal (e.g. ctrl-C) in n_tty line discipline

Here is a revised version of my patch, currently in the -mm kernel as
"fix-ixany-and-restart-after-signal-eg-ctrl-c-in-n_tty-line-discipline".
It fixes a couple of issues with ttys in the stopped state.  See patch
below for more details.
This patch should *replace* the old version of the patch.  It is
cleaner, and its behavior better matches that of other Unix platforms.
It also avoids needless/redundant calls to start_tty() when ctrl-S or
ctrl-Q are hit.

Fix two N_TTY line discipline issues related to resuming a stopped TTY
(typically done with ctrl-S):
1) Fix handling of character that resumes a stopped TTY (with IXANY)
With "stty ixany", the TTY line discipline would lose the first character
after the stop, so typing, for example, "hi^Sthere" resulted in "hihere"
(the 't' would cause the resume after ^S, but it would then be thrown away
rather than processed as an input character).  This was inconsistent with
the behavior of other Unix systems.
2) Fix interrupt signal (e.g. ctrl-C) behavior in stopped TTYs
With "stty -ixany" (often the default), interrupt signals were ignored
in a stopped TTY until the TTY was resumed with the start char (typically
ctrl-Q), which was inconsistent with the behavior of other Unix systems.
