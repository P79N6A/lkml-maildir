No. Don't do this. When a trap occurs in kernel space, the
processor does not save ss and esp on the stack. So, inside an
exception handler, regs->esp is actually the top of the stack
when the exception occurs in kernel space, not a pointer to it. 
This change was tested to work fine.
I reverted your change and added a comment to explain what's going
on here. I have also made another fix: trap1 and trap3 now set 
error_code to -1 to mark that these are exceptions. This makes
the Borland debugger Kylix work again on a kprobes kernel. Here is
the incremental patch on top of your latest.
Thanks,
Vamsi.
