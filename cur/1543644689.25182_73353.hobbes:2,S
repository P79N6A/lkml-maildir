If it's IO bound, it's quite possible the problem is the disk
elevator and Andrew Morton's read-latency2 patch might help
somewhat (if the system is heavy on both reads and writes).
If the system is short on RAM and/or swapping, that might be
a VM thing or just a shortage of RAM...
It would make sense to study the output of top and vmstat for
a few hours to identify exactly what the problem is, instead
of trying to fix all kinds of random things that aren't the
core problem.
regards,
Rik
