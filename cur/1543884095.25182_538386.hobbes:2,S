Subject: [PATCH 0/6] cmpxchg cleanups and UML fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This set is a combination of cmpxchg cleanups and UML fixes.
Patches 1 - 3 are the cmpxchg stuff -
	Remove tas() from all arches - I can't find any users.
	Move the i386 cmpxchg to asm-i386/cmpxchg.h
	Move the x86_64 cmpxchg to asm-x86_64/cmpxchg.h
Patches 4 - 6 fix things discovered while playing with pcap interfaces -
	Have the free wrapper detect malloced buffers and call libc free
	Fix the device initialization failure path and other small cleanups
	Allow pcap devices to be assigned MACs on the command line
This is all 2.6.22 material.
				Jeff
