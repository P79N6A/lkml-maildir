the suggestion of the md5sum wasn't related to keeping the data
secure/robust, we don't want to move the "robustness" duty onto the end
users of course, we only want to know when we can break the rsync loop.
The fact we'll do a further check possibly with a signature on the
md5sums, is a bonus, but it's not meant to replace in any way the
robusteness effort on the server side and we don't do it for robustness,
we do it only for providing a means of coherency to the changesets in
the tree.
