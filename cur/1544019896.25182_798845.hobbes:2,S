A couple of reasons...
a) Bugs happen.  Sometimes bugs are latent, and we later find ourselves
    in an unenviable position of not being able to work around a problem
    unless we know that we were loaded by <loader X> with <problem Y>.
b) Distro installers or other distro components sometimes find this
    useful.
