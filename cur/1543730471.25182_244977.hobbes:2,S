I'm not the original poster, but after a little thought I agreed with
his preference.  If the -rcs are going to be based on the non-bugfixed
releases, it follows that the next full patch will also have to be off
of the previous full release.
If each bugfix built on the last, instead of the full release, that
would be a number of patch files that I'd have to keep around, and then
undo when patching up to the next release.  If each bugfix included all
the previous bugfixes, it would just be one patch I'd have to undo.
