Hi,
I need to know what UART type the serial driver detects for the two built-in
serial ports on the AMD Elan Microcontroller?
Would some nice person who has an Elan based system please send me the first
ten lines of the output of the following command?
	more /proc/tty/driver/serial
Thanks in advance,
Ed
