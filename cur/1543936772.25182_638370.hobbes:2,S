Follows.
-----------
Per maintainer's request, use 0 as a failure value, rather than
making a new macro HFS_BAD_KEYLEN, and use a switch statement
instead of if's.
Add new fail: target to __hfs_brec_find to skip assignments using
bad values when exiting with a failure.
-----------
Sorry 'bout that.
