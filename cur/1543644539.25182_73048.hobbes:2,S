action is policy, it does not belong in the kernel at all.  Further, I 
not sure we need to add all this new infrastructure when we could obtain 
the same result via [off the top of my head] printk standards in key 
drivers.
Why don't you start out with a list of requirements that you want to see 
from drivers?  Only then can we objectively evaluate our needs.
You are proposing a solution without really making it clear what 
problems you are solving.
