An array is a word that contains the address of the first element.
Exercise 1:  What is the difference between the following two
declarations at the source level and at the ABI level?
a) int main(int argc, char *argv[])
b) int main(int argc, char **argv)
Exercise 2:  What would the following in hypothetical C startup code do?
	char *args[10];
	int count = 10;
	...
	exit(main(count - 1, args + 1));
