   Maybe I'm an old stick in the mud, but IRC seems like a big waste of
   time to me.
It's like being at a Linux conference all the time. :-)
It does kind of make sense given that people are so scattered across
the planet.  Sometimes I want to just grill someone on something, and
email would be too much back and forth, IRC is one way to accomplish
that.
