Oh right! Even better.

The problem with encoding phys in class ID is the following: you have
to guarantee that the moment you destroy underlying hw device yur
input_device has to be gone too. Imagine you have input_device for
your PS/2 mouse and you decide to unload psmouse module. You also have
one of user processes holding any of the class device attributes open.
This causes input_device to be pinned into memory so when you load
psmouse module back again it will not be able to create new
input_device and mouse will be dead. With monotonicaly increasing
inputX name you will never have this issue.
You had a workaround for this problem with your original path but when
you fold it all in core you lost it.
