Hello Rusty and all.
I was a developer of LKST, and I know about GKHI's implementation.
rusty> Fault-Injection Test Harness Project
rusty> -------------------------------------
Now, I am interested in your project, and I read white paper for 
investigation.
I think that following development items haven't been completed yet.
Is it correct?
- Interceptor of PCI configuration. 
- Caller of Code Segment.
If these aren't completed yet, I want to develop it.
Best Regards.
