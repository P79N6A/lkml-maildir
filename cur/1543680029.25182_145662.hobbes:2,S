Linux (2.4.18) places incoming connection requests into the syn_recd state
when the server's backlog queue is full.  I thought they were supposed to be
discarded if the server's backlog is full, forcing the client to
subsequently retransmit the request after it times out.  Why does linux put
the server side into the syn_recd state when its backlog is full?
