Don't bother.  I just checked 2.6.22-rc3 and the problem is not present 
which means something between rc2 and rc3 has fixed the problem.  I hate 
it when problems (appear to) fix themselves as it usually means they're 
just hiding.
I didn't see any patches between rc2 and rc3 that were likely to have 
fixed this (but doesn't mean there wasn't one).  I'm wondering whether I 
should do a git bisect to see if I can find where it got fixed?
Could you see if you can reproduce it on 2.6.22-rc2?
Thanks
Peter
