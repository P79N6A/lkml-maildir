The thing I would like to see is an easy way for a user space
application to see the available watchdog devices without searching
every possible bus type.  If we had that one location to find all
watchdog devices, then each device could just be a symbolic link to the
device in it's real bus.
Maybe the system bus is not right.  Is there a right place, or does the
sysfs layout need a new concept?  This could apply to any type of
device, not just watchdogs.
