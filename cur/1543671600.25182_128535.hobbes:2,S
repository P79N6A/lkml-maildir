This won't change the fact that alpha is PCI-centric (as well as
most other architectures) and in general "struct device" doesn't
provide sufficient DMA information, unlike "struct pci_dev".
pci_* being emulated means pci_dev to device translation and then
rather complex and ugly device to pci_dev translation in arch code.
Sigh...
