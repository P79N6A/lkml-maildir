Oh I got it now ! Sorry for being stupid :(
If pages are freed, they indeed can be reused by kmalloc() and we get page 
faults...
I wrongly assumed these pages would be mapped to different virtual addresses.
So your patch is necessary, unless we can free the pages and let them be used 
only for User context for example.
Thank you
