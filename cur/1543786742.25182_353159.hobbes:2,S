Yes, it works for comparisons. 
But for any other operation this construct has the same problem than
struct timespec itself. You need at least an add function which is
always an add and a comparison / correction vs. nsec >= NSEC_PER_SEC. 
The 64 bit nsec_t value can just be used as is without inventing a
wrapper macro for each operation.
The only point, where (k)timespec has an advantage is that the userspace
value must not be converted to nsec_t, but deducing therefor this is the
better overall solution is a fallacy.
nsec_t				ktimespec
syscall:
32x32 mul
64bit add			2 x 32bit move
arm timer:
64 bit add			2 x 32 bit add
				  32 bit compare
				  32 bit sub
				  32 bit add
The 3 operation compensate for the 32x32 
multiplication.
For interval timers you have the 
				  32 bit compare
				  32 bit sub
				  32 bit add
additional overhead for each rearm.
The backward conversion from nsec_t to timespec is almost a non issue.
The vast majority of callers dont provide the second argument to
nanosleep(), setitimer(), set_timer() which makes the conversion
necessary and I think we optimize for the common use case.
Besides that the representation of time in nsec_t values is much
clearer. 
I know that we have to deal with timespecs vs. userspace, but keeping
this representation for kernel internal usage reminds me on the BCD
calculations which were a similar 2^x vs 10^x oddity in the early days
of microprocessors. Of course they were obstinate and survived a
surprisingly long time.
