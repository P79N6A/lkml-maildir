==> Regarding compile problem in 2.3.48 (ad1848.c); Mike Coleman <mkc@kc.net> adds:
mkc> I am unable to compile 2.3.48 as is.  I get an error while compiling
mkc> ad1848.c (I have a GUS MAX).
mkc> The problem seems to be this code
>> ifdef MODULE
mkc>     static int timer_installed = -1;
>> endif
   I think this should be changed to:
#ifndef EXCLUDE_TIMERS
        static int timer_installed = -1;
#endif
