When I plug it in and modprobe is triggered to load the driver, a script then
runs to feed the device appropriate configuration info. Since the driver only
resets the hardware when it is given the correct configuration, there's no
problem.

Hmm... define "identical". I take a laptop home, use a USB NIC to talk to my
LAN at home (using NAT) with a 192.168.* address. Then I take it elsewhere and
use the same model of NIC on the college LAN. All of a sudden, I get myself
banging on the door complaining about misconfigured NICs :-)

That sounds a lot like what I've been advocating all along, if that file is
created/updated by a script when eth0's driver is unloaded, then fed back to
eth0 on load.

Yes, that's what we need. A registry, so configuration problems can be
persistent across boots, and even reinstallations... ;-)
