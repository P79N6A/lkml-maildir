_PCI Systems Architecture_ is an awesome book, definitely.
AFAIK there are two avenues to go, when getting the PCI specs.
Become a PCI SIG member (much $$$), or buy a CD-ROM.
For US$50, a non-member can purchase a CD-ROM from the PCI SIG
which includes the latest versions of all the PCI specifications,
in PDF format, as well as a hardcopy of the PCI 2.2 spec itself.
Great deal, I recommend it for anybody intersted in hacking PCI.
