If it's just distributed with kernel but can not be cleanly applied then
what's the point ? And it can not be kept applyable without maintaining.

May be. If you want some deep change like this included in kernel then better
start working on it when new development kernel is spawned, NOT when kernel is
in deep code-freeze and almost ready to go (Ok, 2.4 is not exactly "almost
ready to go" but it's in deep code freeze for sure).

It can be expected. Instead of few dozends of pre-emption points there are
just six.

If you need latency level of original Ingo patch, can not be satisfied with
anything worse then what all the fuzz was about ? It's perfactly clear that
now is WAY to late to do deep redesign of 2.4 subsystems to resolve problem
in sane way and Linus said quite definitely than he WILL NOT allow huge pile
of kludges like Ingo's patch to be applied. So it was quite obvious even before
petition was signed that you WILL NOT get 2.3 ms in your lab out of stock 2.4
kernel - no matter what, if and how: 2.3 ms was NEVER declared as starting
point for new patches; it's more like a goal. Ok, perhaps it was not 100%
clear - it was 99.999% clear or may be even 99.9% clear. It's now in more or
less the same state: may be there are some way to do it in acceptable for Linus
way but chances are slim, real slim.
