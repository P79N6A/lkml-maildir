Dominik,
This is a little bit late. There are already two fixes for the SMBus 
unhidding : one generic by linux, that is in 2.6.9-rc1-bk2 or 
2.6.9-rc1-mm1 that fixes the SMBus but that is not really SMBus related 
and one specific that you can find at 
<
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3191>.
 Linux blessed this patch 
as it makes clear that unhiding the bus without reserving the IO space 
is the root of the real problem but did not incorporate it probably 
because the other fix is already in and mine should be done for buggy 
BIOS (DTST) that access the hidden SMBus not indirect the IO BAR but via 
  hardwired values,
Patch is not yet merged and may well never be as now problem is masked,
