At the moment, there is no hurry as this code is shared with arch/ppc
which hasn't been ported to genirq, so we need to handle both cases.
(Though I'm not sure we ever get CONFIG_IRQSTACKS with arch/ppc ... I
should probably check). The code uses desc->handle_irq and falls back to
__do_IRQ() if that is NULL.
