How do you see lot of bm_activity. The monitoring window seems to be  
very small here. Just around the calculation of expected_us.

I am also thinking about break_elapsed_us.
>>> +	data->break_elapsed_us += measured_us;
It seems to assume that we are in back to back idle. But it can be
idle -> busy -> idle -> busy -> idle -> busy that is going to cause  
some interrupt in near future -> idle -> busy
In this case break_elapsed _us would be a huge number which would be  
wrong.
Better way may be to make break_elapsed_us to zero once we notice  
some busy-ness.
Also, instead of one break_elapsed_us and bm, we may have to  
experiment with maintaining previous X values as history and using  
the min of those X values than just one last value. What do you think?
