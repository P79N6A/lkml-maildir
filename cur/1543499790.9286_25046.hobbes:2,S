If you didn't tried VM7 yet, please try directly VM8:
	
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/andrea/kernel-patches/2.2.10_andrea-VM8.gz
I removed the simple oom killer in it since I noticed that the bigger task
may uninterruptible sleep in kernel mode... while we are sure that we'll
be able to kill a faulting task. VM8 still avoids init to be killed (or to
be remapped with bad pages). If it will work fine I'll provide also a
little patch against 2.2.10 clean for kernel inclusion.
Thanks.
