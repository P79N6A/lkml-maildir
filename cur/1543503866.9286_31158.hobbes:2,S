So do I... This is a software problem. Just happens to be a rather

Sounds like a very hard thing to get working efficiently... And very
limited in usefullness. What if you're handling several stream? (Like
multitrack audio :-) How would that be handled efficiently? If you just
interleave the data, you'll end up with a useless structure on the disk,
while the swap can hardly be expected to take care of you writing to
several buffers at once.

Nope, just keep working on the disk I/O performance tuning, and use
normal file I/O, or possibly grab an entire partition and use a custom
(huge block) file system if you really need to get close to the max
transfer rate of the drive. IMHO, if this kind of solutions can't
provide the performance you need, Linux' disk I/O is inefficient and
must be fixed. And it would be in that case. Who has a problem with raw
power? :-)

Not-so-critical means? Usually, audio is a bigger problem than video
when it comes to real time scheduling jitter. 60 Hz frame rate means 17
ms/frame, while most audio folks (don't count me; I'm a latency maniac
;-) want 5 ms processing latency. And off course, everyone wants to use
90% of the CPU power!
