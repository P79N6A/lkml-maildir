Are you sure that the device is rejecting the tag because it does not 
want more tags? Could it be possible that it is just confused by the tag 
numbering (too great tag number)?
As you know, when only the TAG (order+#tag) is rejected by a device, then
the initiator is required to handle the command as an untagged command. 
If the drive behaves so when some other commands are disconnected, then an
OVERLAPPED COMMAND condition may occur. Some device may decide to behave
so when they are in some initialization process, but if they do when they
are full ready to operate then I agree that they must be rudely
blacklisted. 
BTW, I donnot intend to support such crap devices with the ncr driver.

And probably benchmark dependant :)
Some impressive results that are sometimes reported with IDE disks let me
think that most widely-used benchmarks are way-stupid.

As you know, everything that involves computers _is_ buggy and sometimes
much buggy. However, these buggy things often work for numerous people. 
If we wanted to blacklist everything that is bogus, then we would just
have to simply blacklist everything, and only accept to deal with 
basic features. ;)
Tell me if I am wrong, but I understand that you have decided to blacklist
the DPES drive since you have personnaly observed some misbehaviour of the
drive on some of your system.  Even if it will appear that you are right
about the drive bug, this way to proceed for black-listing devices seems
to be also bogus. I think it should be also black-listed. ;-)
If you want to seriously check if the drive really deserves your
punishment, why not to post to the list some proposal of testings that
users that have such drives will be able to try and report you results?
