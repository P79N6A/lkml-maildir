Yes, ntfs-tng currently is read-only pending completion soon-ish. Once it 
is complete and in the kernel write support development will start immediately.
If you (or anyone else) would like to contribute, please download the 
latest ntfs-driver-tng module from the linux-ntfs cvs (see 
http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/
) and have a look at the code. You can direct any 
questions/comments/etc about the code to the mailing list: 
linux-ntfs-dev@lists.sf.net
Best regards,
Anton
