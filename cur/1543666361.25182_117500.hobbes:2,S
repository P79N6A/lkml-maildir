hi!
I took a look at readdir() in 2.5.64's ext2 and found it serialized by BKL.
As far as I see in sources, there is no need in this BKL. So, here is small
patch and some benchmarks. of course, the result was expected pretty much ;)
             500         1000
readdir+BKL: 0m11.793s   0m23.403s
readdir-BKL: 0m6.060s    0m12.113s
description: two processes read own dir populated by files (500 and 1000 files).
this repeats for 100000 times. the iron is dual 1GHz P3.
