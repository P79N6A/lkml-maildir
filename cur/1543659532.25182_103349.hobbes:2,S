Subject: rivafb still broken in 2.5.59

I am using a Geforce 4 Ti 4200, and with great joy I saw that recent 2.5
kernels actually recognize the PCI IDs of this card, so I tried the
module again.
And indeed, my screen went blank, and then started looking like a whole
lot of tiny moose droppings.  I can log in, I can run ls -l, and I can
see motion, but that's about it.  I write this because rivafb has been
broken for months now (also on my notebook with Geforce2 Go), and it is
now broken in a different way, so I thought I'd mention it, since
someone appears to be working on it.
You know, it would help a lot if that someone would publish his email
address somewhere.
