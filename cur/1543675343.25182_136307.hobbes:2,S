As this is only patches 1 and 2 from akpm's suggested changes I was wondering 
if my report got lost in the huge thread so I've included it here:
Ok patch combination final score for me is as follows in the presence of a 
large continuous write:
1 No change
2 No change
3 improvement++; minor hangs with reads
1+2 improvement+++; minor pauses with switching applications
1+2+3 improvement++++; no pauses
Applications may start up slowly that's fine. The mouse cursor keeps spinning 
and responding at all times though with 1+2+3 which it hasn't done in 2.4 for 
a year or so.
Is there a reason the 3rd patch was omitted?
