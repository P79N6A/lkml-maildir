Thanks to everyone who help me solve this one... As suspected by a few of
you it turned out to be duff CPU - you mean Linux can't work around that
yet!! ;)
Thanks again.

Subject: Kernel NULL pointer, over my head...
Morning all,
Sorry for the big cross post but I don't have the first clue about where
to send this one.  I get this from my stock 2.2.18 kernel in
/var/log/syslog:
May  1 05:27:36 mnemosyne kernel: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer
dereference at virtual address 00000000

This time it seemed to be caused by running tar on a file, but I've
noticed a similar error in the past but they've never made anything fall
over.  The tar process appeared to die but then again so did the telnet
session so I don't know in what order they went down.  I tried 3 times
just to check it wasn't a fluke...  What other details would be useful??
Cheers Jamie...
PS I'm not on the linux-kernel list so please post to me directly...
