Well, maybe Changes does not mention it, but...
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/Configure.help
"Configure.help" [readonly] line 8481 of 11048 --76%-- col 1
CONFIG_APM_POWER_OFF
  Enable the ability to power off the computer after the Linux kernel
  is halted. You will need software (e.g., a suitable version of the
  halt(8) command ("man 8 halt")) to cause the computer to power down.
  Recent versions of the sysvinit package available from
  
ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/daemons/init/
 (user:
  anonymous) contain support for this ("halt -p" shuts down Linux and
  powers off the computer, if executed from runlevel 0). As with the
  other APM options, this option may not work reliably with some APM
  BIOS implementations.

On Red Hat:
vi /etc/rc.d/init.d/halt
change command = "halt" to command = "halt -p"
Cheers.
