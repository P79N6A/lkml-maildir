cset 1.952.1.4 is the one that Linus released 2.5.59 on.
Now I started doing some development based on cset 1.875 - a few days older.
Tomorrow Linus release a new kernel, cset 1.973 for example.
Next week Linus merge my work, that will be numbered 1.875.1.1..1.875.1.3
You will see that my cset will be listed on the web on the date where
I did the commit, but it will not appear on kernel.org until
Linus merge my stuff.
So you cannot deduct from the numbers in what release a certain cset belongs.
The fact that cset's appear on the web as they are orginally committed
is annoying tracking the kernel, and Larry sometime ago noted that they
may do some changes in that respect.
