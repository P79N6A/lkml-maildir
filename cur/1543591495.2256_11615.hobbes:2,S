Hi !!
I'm wondering what it may mean - something to be implemented in linux,
of poorly configured system:
---
$ gdb -m dummy -q --batch
warning: mapped symbol tables are not supported on this machine;
missing or broken mmap().
---
When I was reading info, I've seen that "this feature is supported on
chosen platforms", however, I was thinking Linux is the Chosen one
:-)).
Can anyone explain it ??
-- 
Thanks!
