Because it fixes a lot of drivers.

Nope. There's just too much confusion abou what the state thing means. 
See the TG3 driver, for one, all the USB drivers for another.
The long-term solution is to make this thing be not a number at all, but a 
restricted type (ie a "struct" with one member, or similar) to make sure 
you _cannot_ mis-use it. As it is, most PCI drivers do seem to expect a 
PCI suspend state.

If you have the energy to complain about it, maybe you have the energy to 
change it to use a "struct", and fix up all the drivers and verify that 
they actually get it right.
Until that happens, we pass in PCI suspend states, and we _also_ make sure 
that the PCI suspend states "almost match" the PM_SUSPEND_xxx constants, 
so that when there is confusion, it tends to be as benign as possible.
