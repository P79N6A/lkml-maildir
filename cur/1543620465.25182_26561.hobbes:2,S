Well, it is a bug in the debugging code, yes.  We missed to updated the
debugging code when changing the mangle table.  The reason for this is
that not even the developers are using the debugging code.
But when I do compatibility checks / tests for something I want to submit to
the kernel, I use plain unmodified iptables sources - new and old.
And I really didn't expect anybody to run debugging code on production
systems, sorry.
I'm not going to pull this change back out of the kernel because
one (or more) distributors/vendors ship a compiled-with-debug iptables. 
I don't think this was by RedHat's intention.
