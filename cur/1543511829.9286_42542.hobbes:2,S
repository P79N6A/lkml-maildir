I don't think we want to trap open()... Just a guess, but I'm sure that's
what you were hinting at.

This is false. A skeletal device driver could be written that traps
open() and inserts the correct kernel module for the device when open is
called, passing the open args to the new driver. As long as there's some
way to tell what the right module to load is based on the filename
passed to open(), this approach should work find and does not require a
virtual filesystem.
Now, as to which way is more elegant ...
