Thanks to Rolf for posting this, I didn't know this either.
These drivers are the ones for which I have source code (under NDA), and
are the basis for the upcoming open source "native" via sound driver.
It should also be noted that the Via sound chip does not have 100%
hardware MIDI, but merely an additional PCM channel for which MIDI data
can be piped.  You would need to use a userspace solution, or perhaps
the SoftOSS wave table engine, in order to get MIDI support.
