Does everything work when booted in ACPI mode with "pci=noacpi"?
If so, I wouldn't be eager to add a model-specific !ACPI mode workaround
-- which if it goes into the kernel will be there forever.
Also, I'm not enthusiastic about adding the dmi entry for "pci=noacpi"
until we've taken a swing at finding out why Linux/ACPI doesn't work out
of the box on this platform and given up.  For we might find a fix for
this platform that helps other platforms.  Adding the platform-specific
automatic workaround just masks the problem for owners of that exact
model.
So for the ACPI mode part, I encourage you to file a bug here
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=ACPI
Component Config-Interrupts
and assign it to me.  Or if a bug is open already,
please direct me to it.
thanks,
