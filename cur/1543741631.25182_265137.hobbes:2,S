iirc, once i faced this problem. I compiled a sample device driver
against kernel version
'X'. and tried to insmod the binary into kernel version 'Y' which had
it's fop's struct
modified. The structure offsets took a beating and all hell broke
loose. Calling open()
called something else etc.... Ever since, i started using the above notation to
initialize struct members. Hard learned lesson ;-)
