Isn't it is the user's locale, whatever that is? I believe my file names
use ISO-8859-1 (except ntfs, vfat). In northern/western europe 
ISO-8859-1 is common. (Sometimes ISO-8859-15 which for all
practical purposes is backwards compatible with 8859-1). UTF-8 is
gaining terrain though since it is now the default in some distributions
even for Nordic languages (causing big problems for those not
expecting it).
