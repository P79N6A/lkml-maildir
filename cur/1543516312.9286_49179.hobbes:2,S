Comedi provides a generic driver for the 8255 that uses the same
interface as all the other Linux data acquisition drivers.  Although
your board isn't specifically supported, since it is just 8255s
connected to the ISA bus, the generic driver supports it.  You
might want to check it out (

).
It only supports 8255 mode 0, so if you want some of the other
features of the 8255, you would have to add them yourself.
