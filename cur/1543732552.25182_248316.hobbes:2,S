Strange...
Try the following:
rm arch/i386/kernel/acpi/boot.o
make V=1
Since you have tried several versions I assume this file has been rebuild,
so it will still fail.
Try:
nm -p arch/i386/kernel/acpi/boot.o
objdump -x arch/i386/kernel/acpi/boot.o
Try running the gcc command by hand and see if .o file is still bad.
