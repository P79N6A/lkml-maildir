Subject: [PATCH,RESEND] documentation: atomic_add_unless() doesn't imply mb() on failure
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

(the explicit ack/nack from maintainers is wanted).
A "typical" implementation of atomic_add_unless() can return 0 immediately
after the first atomic_read() (before doing cmpxchg). In that case it doesn't
provide any barrier semantics. See include/asm-ia64/atomic.h as an example.
We should either change the implementation, or fix the docs.
