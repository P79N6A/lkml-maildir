Oddly enough that's what I did in my RAM file system.  No matter how
the file/directory node is found (the path can lead through different
parents), it has a unique ID and a corresponding single lock for it.
Rename/delete goes and locks all the nodes that might change parents
and/or children, then it does its operations (though it has to watch
out for deadlocks, which are unavoidable when two rename/deletes both
sneak up on the same file by different paths).
