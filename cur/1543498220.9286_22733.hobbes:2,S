Gzzz. DSP is the hard part. You could use gzip for compression if you
really wanted to, and error correction is usually done with crc +
retransmits, so that's not problem, either.
Well, you could end up with driver that would only be able to connect
linux-to-linux, but I guess that it is WAY better than no driver at
all.
