many people (myself included) have been experimenting with zerocopy 
infrastructures.
in my case, i've been working on it as time permits for quite a few months 
now, and am about on my fourth rewrite.
i've found exactly what you state about the bad things that occur when you 
associate zerocopy infrastructure with user-space code.  some of the the MM 
tricks required for handling individual pages effectively kills any 
performance gain.
however, approaching it from the other angle of "buffers pinned in kernel 
memory" can give you a huge win.
for the application which prompted me to begin looking at this problem, 
where packets typically go network -> RAM -> network, providing a zerocopy 
infrastructure for (a) viewing incoming packet streams pinned in kernel 
memory from user-space [a sort-of SIGIO with pointers to the buffers], and 
(b) hooks for user-space directing the kernel to do things with these 
buffers [eg. "queue buffer A for output on fd Y"] has provided an immediate 
60% performance gain.
performance was previously pinned on front-side-bus (or memory) bandwidth.
the interfaces are a bit hacky, and the way one has to queue packets for 
tcp-write is awful right now, but i hope these can be cleaned up over time.
network cards which offload the IP & TCP checksum calculation isn't even 
required; provided the incoming checksum is preserved, the original pseudo 
TCP header can be "reversed out" without having to re-read the entire 
packet payloads again.
cheers,
lincoln.
