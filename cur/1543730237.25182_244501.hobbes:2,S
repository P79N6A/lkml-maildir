I have the following problems with my Radeon FireGL Mobility T2 (IBM
Thinkpad R50p):
1) there is no console blanking nor backlight off powersaving with
fbconsole (no X running nor started since boot)
2) after an acpi suspend the backlight goes back on but there is no data
displayed on the screen (no X running nor started since boot)
If more information is needed for diagnosis then please email me.
