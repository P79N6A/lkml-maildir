   There was a discussion about SET_MODULE_OWNER here on the list, once.
   You can find it here:
I know about it and in fact Rusty is the one that told me
to do what I did with SET_MODULE_OWNER.
FACT: SET_MODULE_OWNER() tracks how to set the module reference
      for a struct netdevice.
It always lived in netdevice.h and always served exactly this purpose.
So when I deleted ->owner from struct netdevice, SET_MODULE_OWNER
became a nop.
Therefore, it was a complete error for anyone else to start using this
macro for other structures.
