Ick, ok, let's stick with 2 buffers.  How about the patch below?  It's a
bit smaller than yours.
But there might still be a problem.  With this change, the sequence
number is not sent out the kevent message.  Kay, do you think this is an
issue?  I don't think we can get netlink messages out of order, right?
I'll hold off on applying this patch until we figure this out...
thanks,
