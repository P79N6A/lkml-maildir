I don't think that would be a good idea.  We're used to those
test_and_clear operations being atomic, putting an initial non-atomic
test inside would make it fundamentally non-atomic.  We know here that
it's not the end of the world if we miss a racing transition of the
young bit, but it wouldn't be good to hide and force that on others.
