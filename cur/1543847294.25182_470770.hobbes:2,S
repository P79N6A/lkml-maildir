- You may find that gcc generates crap code for the initialisation of the
  `struct fault_data'.  If so, filling the fields in by hand one-at-a-time
  will improve things.
- So is the plan here to migrate all code over to using
  vm_operations.fault() and to finally remove vm_operations.nopage and
  .nopfn?  If so, that'd be nice.
- As you know, there is a case for constructing that `struct fault_data'
  all the way up in do_no_page(): so we can pass data back, asking
  do_no_page() to rerun the fault if we dropped mmap_sem.
- No useful opinion on the substance of this patch, sorry.  It's Saturday ;)
