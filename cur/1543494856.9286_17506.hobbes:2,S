Hallo,
we are working on a pressure control system, which has to control 2 pumps
over a serial lines (RS232) an to measure a pressure sensor over the
parallel port.
The control algorithm should run as a RT-task as a kernel module.
So this modules has to communicate with the serial lines.
Compiling it as a userspace program works fine unless the timing accuracy.
As a kernel module the symbols 
	open, close, write, read ...
are unresolved unless static linking against libc.a,
but then the symbols 
	__udivdi3 and __umoddi3
are undefined.
Is there a general problem with the use of file i/o in kernel modules,
or is the libc.a (ver 5.4.33?) to old?
Thanks in advance
Stefan Fischer
