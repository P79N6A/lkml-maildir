Actually, there's no problem with 0.3 against 0.4 as 0.3 won't be
going into any standard kernels anyway. I'm working strictly with the
0.4 version.
The basic point is this: If, as a result of experience after the
e2comp subsystem is folded into the kernel, the decision is taken to
depreciate a particular compression method, MY opinion is that the
CORRECT way to do so is as follows:
 1. Remove the compression side thereof, and tweak the kernel to
    declare any files compressed with it as being read-only until
    such time as they are converted to a fully supported compression
    format. The kernel would also at this stage be set to log a
    message stating that file X is compressed with the said
    depreciated protocol and should be converted before the kernel
    is updated.
    Note that in this context, a request to rename or delete the
    file would NOT be considered to be a write request.
 2. Tweak the e2fsck tool to look for any files compressed using a
    depreciated protocol and perform the equivalent of doing the
    following on all such files:
	chattr -c '{}' && chattr +c '{}'
    This should result in all such files being converted to a
    non-depreciated protocol fairly soon after the decision was
    made to depreciate the given protocol.
    Since such a tweak should be generic enough to automatically
    determine which compression protocols are currently set up as
    depreciated and uncompressable, and should ignore files that
    are not uncompressable, this will require either a sysctl or
    an extra file in /proc to provide the relevant details.
 3. Wait for several (at least 8) kernel versions to be released.
 4. Remove the decompression side as well, and tweak the kernel to
    refuse all access to the said file, with the kernel logging a
    message stating that access was refused, and why.
I still believe such to be the correct way of doing so, but I am open
to comments as to what is wrong with it.

If you read the above, you will see that the long term aim of such a
decision would indeed be to take it out of the kernel entirely, but
the design provides for automatic conversion

Given the above procedure for depreciating a compression protocol,
there should be no need for a separate user-mode protocol to do that.

I'm dealing strictly with the 0.4 version, so will leave comments
regarding this to Peter...
