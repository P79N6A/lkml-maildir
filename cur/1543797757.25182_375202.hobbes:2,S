well, module tda9887 is loaded properly using autodetect.
However, using xawtv I was able to see video at good quality, but no sound :(
(even when I set PAL-BG norm). But after a while, it complained about QFBUF
ioctl and from that moment TV capture stopped working until reboot (rmmod cx8800
& rmmod cx88xx did not help).
I might be a video_buf bug, I did not removed video_buf module.
