The closest thing to what you are looking for is a callback to a signal
handler.  Currently there are no other kernel->user callbacks for an
already running process.  Kerneld used SysV IPC, but it was a gross hack
so that's not really an option.  You could try to have the kernel raise
a signal to the process (say SIGUSR1), and that signal handler would
handle the event.  Or, you could have your module register a character
device and let the processes poll the device node for events.
