sorry, this was really not meant to slight your contributions in this 
area in any way :-) I'm just judging by the spaghetti still hanging 
around in asm-x86/*.h, and the 'fun' we have with paravirt and its type 
dependencies - and the periodic messups we have with macros. (and many 
macros are not inlines due to ugly dependencies.)

as long as it builds/boots on your box with a single convenient .config 
of yours, we can stick such patches into x86.git and work out all the 
build failures it might cause.
