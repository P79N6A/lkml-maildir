There's no problem in it. I'm working on a user-space filesystem using
Jeremy's userfs and then you can do commands like 
  cp /http/somehost/some.tar.gz <somewhere_else>
I've even done a 'network filesystem' skeleton, which you can use for
quite simple implementation of other user-space filesystems like ftpfs.
I hope I'll finish it quite soon.
Concerning the possibility of writing user-space filesystems in current
kernels: You have several choices. Good overview is on Pavel Machek's
Podfuk site 
http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pavel/podfuk/podfuk.html.
I prefere the userfs.
I'm asking the other fs-developers: Is there any other current project of
httpfs, ftpfs like filesystems right now, which would implement these
filesystems inside kernel?
I'm curious how would someone implement inside kernel things like
gethostbyname(), etc. or using the TCP.
Yes. I can see a sense in using such filesystems like httpfs.
