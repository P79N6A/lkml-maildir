It doesn't do load balance in wake_up_forked_process()  and is relatively
non aggressive in balancing later. This leads to the multithreaded OpenMP
STREAM running its childs first on the same node as the original process
and allocating memory there. Then later they run on a different node when
the balancing finally happens, but generate  cross traffic to the old node, 
instead of using the memory bandwidth of their local nodes.
The difference is very visible, even the 4 thread STREAM only sees the
bandwidth of a single node. With a more aggressive scheduler you get
4 times as much.
Admittedly it's a bit of a stupid benchmark, but seems to representative
for a lot of HPC codes.
