Hmm..Okay. I'll try some check patch today. please review it.
Maybe moving ioresouce collision check in early stage of add_memory() is good ?
Note:
I remove pfn_valid() here because pfn_valid() just says section exists or
not. When adding seveal small memory chunks in one section, Only the  first
small chunk can be added.
