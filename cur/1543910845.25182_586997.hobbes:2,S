I have an Acer Ferrari 5000 laptop, it has an AMD64 TL-60 processor, and an
RS480 host bridge. I'm running 2.6.22, I get no HPET.
From looking at the kernel source, the HPET driver is looking for PNP0103. I see
no PNP0103 entry on my machine, just PNP0100. Searching around, it looks like
kernels running on other RS480 systems are finding HPETs.

Do I need to get Acer to update the BIOS to include a PNP0103 entry? Is there
some way I can force this?
