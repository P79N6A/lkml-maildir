Hi Chris.
Thanks for working on this.

Obviously - I missed the find when I looked.
Thanks for the explanation. And no comments needed in the script -
I should just have read the full command line.

Un-comment it so we do not break make help.

find . -maxdepth 1 -! -name 'asm*'

Oleg (added to mail) - you are quite confident in sed et al.
Let us know if there is a simpler way.
(We want to pick i386 from include/asm-x86_64/Kbuild
and similar for the architectures that uses ARCHDEF).
