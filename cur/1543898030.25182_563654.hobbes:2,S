Folks,
After updating an x86_64 machine from 2.6.21 to 2.6.22-rc6 and
fighting off the where-the-fuck-did-my-serial-console-go blues
(legacy_serial.force), I finally discovered why the damn thing
wasn't booting - the machine was sitting there in a loop outputting
"hda: lost interrupt" over and over again during hardware
discovery (hda = dvd drive).
It doesn't happen on every boot - more boots hung than failed,
though, while I was trying to work out where my serial port
went and get some work done.
Since I've had the console operative, the boot hangs are
basically like:
ESB2: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:00:1f.1
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:1f.1[A] -> GSI 20 (level, low) -> IRQ20

......
The success boots I've had (looking at the boot logs) have all
failed to discover the dvd drive correctly except one. The
one that dsicovered it still had errors, though. Errors
look like:
ESB2: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:00:1f.1
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:1f.1[A] -> GSI 20 (level, low) -> IRQ20

Probing IDE interface ide0...
hda: probing with STATUS(0xa0) instead of ALTSTATUS(0x58)

hdb: probing with STATUS(0xb0) instead of ALTSTATUS(0x00)

hdb: <some ctrl char>, ATAPI UNKNOWN (type 31) drive
hda: set_drive_speed_status: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hda: selected mode 0x0
hda: set_drive_speed_status: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }

hda: set_drive_speed_status: error=0x04 { AbortedCommand }
hda: selected mode 0x0
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
Another failure mode:
hda: probing with STATUS(0xa0) instead of ALTSTATUS(0x58)
hda: <some ctrl char>, ATAPI UNKNOWN (type 31) drive
hdb: probing with STATUS(0xb0) instead of ALTSTATUS(0x00)

ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
hda: lost interrupt
hda: task_in_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: task_in_intr: error=0x04 { AbortedCommand }
ide: failed opcode was: 0xa1
And another:
hda: host side 80-wire cable detection failed, limiting max speed to UDMA33
hda: set_drive_speed_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: set_drive_speed_status: error=0x04 { AbortedCommand }
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
hda: lost interrupt
And other boots were a combination of the ones above.
And the boot that really read the drive type properly but had
scary warnings:
ESB2: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:00:1f.1
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:1f.1[A] -> GSI 20 (level, low) -> IRQ20

<repeat another 10 times>
I haven't seen any failures like this on 2.6.21 or earlier, so
this is appears to be new to 2.6.22-rc.
Cheers,
Dave.
