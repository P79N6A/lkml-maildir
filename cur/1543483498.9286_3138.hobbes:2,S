I'm having trouble setting up IPIP tunneling with 2.2.1.  I have reviewed
all the comments I could find on linux-kernel and found that the method
for initializing the tunnels has changed.
I've compiled ipip as a module, and inserted it into my kernel. I try to
run: 
ip tunnel add tunl0 mode ipip remote <remaddr>
but get back "ioctl: No buffer space available" from the ip route tool.
Same result if I include a local parameter.
I am using iproute2 from debian iproute_980630.  Do I need a later
version?  I'm assuming its a kernel issue since its the ioctl thats
failing.  Is there some other step I'm missing? Incidentally, I can
configure the tunl0 interface and add routes to it, but nothing seems to
come through it.  I'm assuming it's because the ip tunnel command is
failing. 
The remote end of the tunnel is a 2.0.36 box that is not modified at all
(in fact not even rebooted) between testing with the different kernels
here, and all works if I run 2.0.36 locally.
Any help greatly appreciated.  Useful answers will be compiled and
probably contributed to the linux/Documentation dir.
