I have to correct myself: it seems, the check is not needed.  Ctime is
never set explicitly.  So filesystem can simply ignore ATTR_CTIME, and
do the right thing without it.
ATTR_MTIME is _only_ set in utime[s], which all filesystems want to
honor.
So I think the only thing CIFS needs is simply to ignore ATTR_CTIME.
