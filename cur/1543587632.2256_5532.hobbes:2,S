Subject: 2.4.4-pre3: lvm.c patch results in "hanging" mount or swapon

Hello,
While trying kernel 2.4.4-pre3 i found a "hanging" swapon (my swap is on
LVM), same effect for "mount -a". 2.4.3 works properly.
I found ./drivers/md/lvm.c is patched, and restoring the lvm.c from 2.4.3
resulted in normal operation.
I Found LVM/0.9.1_beta7 makes some notes about the patch, so i tried that
(beta7), but no luck, only 2.4.3:lvm.c worked ok.
Greatings,
