Sure.  The kernel doing a big job without scheduling anything 
is a problem.

A problem with this is that normal paging-in is allowed to page other
things out as well.  But you can't have that when swap is about to
be turned off.  My guess is that swapoff functionality was perceived to
be so seldom used that they didn't bother too much with scheduling 
or efficiency.
I don't have the same problem myself though.  Shutting down with
30M or so in swap never take unusual time on 2.4.x kernels here,
with a 300MHz processor.  I did a test while typing this letter,
almost filling the 96M swap partition with 88M.  swapoff
took 1 minute at 100% cpu.  This is long, but the machine was responsive
most of that time.  I.e. no worse than during a kernel compile.
The machine froze 10 seconds or so at the end of the minute, I can
imagine that biting with bigger swap.
