Exact!!!! . To be honest, I have the 2.6.12 version to debian, but my 
project tutor has this one. And when I argued about my project and I 
told him that those fields weren´t accesible, he sent me his sched.h, 
and I saw that runqueue and prio_array were accesible in it. I didn´t 
think that it was a SUSE patch . Sorry, it's my fault
I have made a litte cheat to be able to see prio_array fields, I have 
created a new struct and later with the "array" field of "task_struct" I 
have made a cast to my struct. Then I have been able to show these 
values, but I don't like this "solution", because I can´t know anything 
of tasks in another state ("active" or "expired"), neither which is my 
state!! For this reason I would like to know how to get this 
information, my project have to be done in June 30 :(.
Thank you very much again for your help, I´m getting a lot of 
information about the kernel that I'll be able to use in my report, of 
course if you agree.
