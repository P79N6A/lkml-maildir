Hi guys
I was wondering whether anyone can shed any light on the status of SATA tape
drives.  There's very little info on the net about this at least in the
places I've checked; the only thing of any significance I've found thus far
is a note in a Bacula document dated April 2007 which states that drives
other than real SCSI units don't generally work with Bacula.
To put this into context, I'm looking at purchasing a Sony SDX470VRB SATA
AIT-1 tape drive for use with the SATA controller on an Intel DG31PR
mainboard.  The drive will be used primarily with tar/cpio.  Obvsiouly
however I only want to make the purchase if there's a reasonable chance of
it working.
I would appreciate any information you can shed on this issue.
Regards
  jonathan
