My installation of Ubuntu is having trouble with my kernel build
because I disabled support for sysctl:
warning: process `ls' used the removed sysctl system call
warning: process `touch' used the removed sysctl system call
warning: process `touch' used the removed sysctl system call
warning: process `evms_activate' used the removed sysctl system call
warning: process `alsactl' used the removed sysctl system call
I am curious whether the use of sysctl indicates a problem in these
processes.  What is the benefit of offering disabling sysctl support?
Thanks,
        Miles
