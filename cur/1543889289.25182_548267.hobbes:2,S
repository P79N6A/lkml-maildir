I did realize it, but tv2 > tv1 can't happen and makes no sense for
the users of this function. I probably should have provided a more
detailed changelog entry.

It is used to calculate the amount of tokens a tocken bucket has
accumulated since the last refill, thus we always have tv1 >= tv2
(modulo ktime wraps). In fact tv2 > tv1 was never properly
supported. This macro would have returned the negative long long
value, but all users assign it to a psched_tdiff_t (long), so
depending on the exact values, it might still be interpreted as a
large positive value. Additionally there was a second implementation
for the gettimeofday clocksource that didn't return the negative
difference but the bound value.
