If you've I/O bound ( very low user space average run time ) tasks
accumulation, it's very likely that the bottom part of the iceberg (
kernel ) is becoming quite fat with respect of the userspace part.
Coming at the pipe example, let's take Larry's lat_ctx ( lmbench ).
This is bouncing data through pipes using I/O bound tasks, and running
vmstat together with a lat_ctx 32 32 ... ( long list ), you'll see the run
queue length barley reach 3 ( with 32 bouncing tasks ).
It barely reaches 5 with 64 bouncing tasks.
