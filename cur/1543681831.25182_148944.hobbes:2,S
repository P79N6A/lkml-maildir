I am using gcc version 3.3 20030623 (Red Hat Linux 3.3-12)
so that may be to blame...
...but I have received the bellow oopses while copying files to a "Device-Mapper" striped device with
'tar cf - . | tar - -C /mnt/tmp'
oops1: reiserfs format device (with BadRAM patch)
oops2: ext2/3 format device (with BadRAM patch)
oops3: reiserfs format device (with mem=320M BadRAM patch
       removed.
Kernel 2.6.0-test1-mm1 (with latest device-mapper patches)
was used with these oopses however I have had a similar
oops though while using device-mapper (I was compiling 
glibc) with 2.6.0-test1:
2.6.0-test1.oops
While using 2.6.0-test1-ac1 to attempt the same procedure as described above USB was killed:
uhci-bad
Also attached dmesg and .config used for 2.6.0-test1-mm1
Now having said all of that, I should add that the system runs completely stable under a modified Red Hat 2.4.20-9 (ACPI patch amoung other things) also compiled with the same compiler.
The hardware in this machine is:
Intel P3 (coppermine stepping 10) 933MHz
BIOSTAR M6VBE-A (VIA Apollo Pro 133 based)
384MiB 256+128 (with defect in last 64MiB of 128MiB) 133MHz
