The definition in an absolute way is not the real problem.  The real
problem is that good/bad coding style has more than just one
dimension.  Trying to rate it in just one dimension will almost always
fail.
That said, this discussion appears to have zero impact on the kernel
itself, so it might be time to fade it out.
