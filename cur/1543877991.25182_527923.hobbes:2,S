Erm, stale patch, sorry.  This one instead.
Critical bugfix; when using software RAID, potentially USB or AIO in
highmem configurations, drivers are allowed to use kmap_atomic from
interrupt context.  This is incompatible with the current implementation
of lazy MMU mode, and means the kmap will silently fail, causing either
memory corruption or kernel panics.
The fix is to disable interrupts on the CPU when entering a lazy MMU
state; this is totally safe, as preemption is already disabled, and
lazy update state can neither be nested nor overlapping.  Thus per-cpu
variables to track the state and flags can be used to disable interrupts
during this critical region.
