Actually its impossible to be entirely compliant because the spec is too
vague.

All the x86 cpu SMP machines have synchronized busses so the TSC rate is
the same (so far anyway) but the TSC start on a few machines varies. 2.2.15pre
is quite happy on such a board but the code hasnt been rewritten for 2.3.x
as far as I know.
