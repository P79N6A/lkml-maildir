A czech keyboard has the letters 'escrzyaie' with accents on the number
row of keys. With a Shift, they are supposed to produce the original
numbers, but with a CapsLock, they're supposed to produce the uppercase.
With a right alt or one of three czech dead keys they should produce
the !@#$%^&*() symbols.
It's kind of logical, kind of stupid, but anyway it's the national standard.
You can't do that currently. The main problem is that CapsLock is
hardcoded to work as a Shift on keys and you can't make it work
differently for normal letter keys and for the upper row of keys.
