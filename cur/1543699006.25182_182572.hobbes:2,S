reiserfs has no fixed predefined number of inodes on the file
system. Hence, field f_files of struct statfs (see man 2 statfs) is not
applicable to this file system. Man page explicitly says:
       Fields that are undefined for a particular file system are
       set  to  0.
Previous man page stated that file system should put -1 (4294967295)
into undefined fields. Reiserfs has been changed to conform to the
changed specification.
SuS simply says:
NAME
    fstatvfs, statvfs - get file system information
SYNOPSIS
    [XSI] #include <sys/statvfs.h>
    int fstatvfs(int fildes, struct statvfs *buf);
    int statvfs(const char *restrict path, struct statvfs *restrict buf);
DESCRIPTION
    [...]
    It is unspecified whether all members of the statvfs structure have
    meaningful values on all file systems.

inn2 should be fixed. :)
Fix would really be simple: ignore test results if ->f_files is 0 or
0xffffffff.
