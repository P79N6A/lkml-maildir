Well, this idea itsel is quite neat, and could sometimes save lots of time 
(esp. when dealing with serious modules' deps). I would like to propose 
slightly different appropach:
cp /lib/modules/2.6.0-test2/kernel/drivers/somedriver.ko /proc/modtree
is equivalent to insmod somedriver.ko (or modprobe ?). (How one could pass 
module params in the former case ?). 
Then, if no other module depends on it, then this entry (under /proc/modtree) 
is a file, otherwise its a directory, with all depending modules also either 
files or dirs. So, module removal would be as simple as 
[ -f /proc/modtree/somedriver ] && rm /proc/modtree/somedriver || \
[ -d /proc/modtree/somedriver ] && rm -rf /proc/modtree/somedriver/* ; \
rm /proc/modtree/somedriver
