OK right. As far as I can see, the algorithm in the RAID1 code
is used to select the best drive to read from? If that is the
case then I don't think it could make better decisions given
more knowledge. It really wants to know if the disk head is
close to request x however it is impossible to tell where the
disk head will be by the time request x is the next in line
for that disk, regardless if it can look at the low level
queues or not.
It seems to me that a better way to layer it would be to have
the complex (ie deadline/AS/CFQ/etc) scheduler handling all
requests into the raid block device, then having a raid
scheduler distributing to the disks, and having the disks
run no scheduler (fifo).
In practice the current scheme probably works OK, though I
wouldn't know due to lack of resources here :P
