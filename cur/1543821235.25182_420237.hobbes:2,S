Thanks! I merged your stuff and pushed out an updated patch.

[PATCH] IP1000 Gigabit Ethernet device driver
This is a cleaned up fork of the IP1000A device driver:
  
http://www.icplus.com.tw/driver-pp-IP1000A.html
Open issues:
  - ipg_probe() looks really fishy and doesn't handle all errors
    (e.g. ioremap failing).
  - ipg_nic_do_ioctl() is playing games with user-space pointer.
    We should use ethtool ioctl instead as suggested by Arjan.
  - something (PHY reset/auto negotiation?) takes 2-3 seconds and
    appears to be done with interrupts disabled.
Changelog:
  - Kill 2.2 and 2.4 compatability macros
  - Use proper module API
  - Use proper PCI API
  - Use netdev_priv
  - Consolidate headers to one file
  - Use __iomem annotations
  - Use iomap instead of read/out for I/O
  - Remove obfuscating register access macros
  - Remove changelogs
  - Remove ether_crc_le() -- use crc32_le() instead.
  - No more nonsense with root_dev -- ipg_remove() now works.
  - Move PHY and MAC address initialization into the ipg_probe().  It was
    previously filling in the MAC address on open which breaks some user
    space.
  - Folded ipg_nic_init into ipg_probe since it was broke otherwise.
I don't have the hardware, so I don't know if I broke anything.
The patch is 128 KB in size, so I am not including it in this
mail. You can find the patch here:
