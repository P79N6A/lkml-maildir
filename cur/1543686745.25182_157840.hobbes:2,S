Look at 2.6, that annotatation is already there.

Nice, is cqual released somewhere so that we can compare it and start
using it, like we already use sparse?

Yes it is, one of the paramaters in those functions is the size of the
buffer :)

Not really, you still are saying that all tty drivers need to be
changed, and new logic added to handle the additional paramater.  With
my proposed change, all drivers also have to be changed, but logic and
paramaters gets to be removed, making it harder for tty driver authors
to get things wrong.
