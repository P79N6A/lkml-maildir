I see.  Guess I should finally test that tmpfs/loop patch, eh? :-)
I just now crashed Red Hat 7.3 on x86 SMP by compiling in khttpd
and serving files out of a tmpfs.  It crashed with or without my 
earlier patch (
http://www.kegel.com/linux/khttpd/khttpd-unbork.patch
)
that fixes khttpd crashes with other filesystems.
Guess it wasn't a bug in linuxppc_2_4_devel after all.
I am now switching to ramfs instead of tmpfs to hold my documentroot,
and that should be the end of my khttpd problems.
(There is no disk on the embedded ppc system I'm using, so I have
to use one ram filesystem or another.)
