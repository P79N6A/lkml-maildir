Subject: init 0 freeze with kernel 2.5.1

Hello,
	On my Debian Sid system, when I type 'halt' or 'init 0' using kernel 
2.5.1, the systems blocks on "Init: sending KILL signal to all 
processes..." (console switching and magic sysrq still works). This 
doesn't happen with 2.4.* (2.4.15, 2.4.17-rc1, 2.4.17-rc2), and it 
didn't with 2.5.1-pre5.
	On all those kernels I've applied the preemptive patch and some patches 
from Netfiler's patch-o-matic. On 2.5.1 and 2.5.1-pre5, I've enabled 
devfs, not on 2.4.17-rc2.
	If you need additional infos, or if you additionals tests (like building 
the 2.5.1 without devfs or preempt) I can do it, but I go to holidays 
Saturday.
Thanx to you all !
