Bad news for Andrew's patch, however I really don't think it would have
helped you much in the first place. The problem seems to be down to
loosing read-ahead when cache ends up eating all of available memory,
I've seen this effect myself too. Maybe the vm needs to be more
aggressive about tossing out pages when this happens, I'm quite sure
that would help tremendously for this workload.
