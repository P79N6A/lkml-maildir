  Hello.
  So I've updated my quota patches for 2.4.0-prerelease. I also
fixed one locking bug in implementation of new quotafile format
and added a few comments. I also fixed compilation problems
(when quota was disabled) - Alan, were there any problems
I didn't fix (I've seen you and someone else were fixing some
compilation problems with my patches in -ac but I've seen
no mail about it (maybe I just missed it))?
  The patches can be downloaded from:
ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/local/jack/quota/v2.4/
as quota-fix-2.4.0-pre-1.diff and quota-patch-2.4.0-pre-1.diff.
Contents of patches:
quota-fix: This patch mainly fixes bugs in current quota code:
  * races between preallocation and chgrp/chown fixed
  * cleaned up locking
  * quotas are dynamically allocated (so there are no more 'No free dquots' messages)
quota-patch: This patch implements new quotafile format. It allows:
  * accounting of quota in bytes
  * 32-bit UIDs/GIDs
  * root is no longer special user
Note that you will need new quota utilities for new quotafile format (you can
download them at 
ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/local/jack/quota/utils/quota-3.00-4.tar.gz
).
Also note that quota-patch requires quota-fix to be already applied.
