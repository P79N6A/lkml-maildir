For TX the checksum is only offloaded when you set and support NETIF_F_SG 
as well.  Otherwise the stack has to copy anyways and can compute the 
checksum during the copy operation.  Then with NETIF_F_SG the TX checksumming
will only be used with sendfile(), because that is the only way to do zero 
copy for now.
For RX you should set skb->ip_summed and skb->csum. The hardware checksum
is more useful in this case.
