There seems to be a problem in the frame buffer console, It appears as if the 
resolution has been changed from 1024x768 to 1024x800 or something like that 
(I can only half see the sh prompt when it has come down), but the argument I 
passed at boot time was still 788. It doesn't appear to have been solved 
according to the bk csets taken from kernel.org.
