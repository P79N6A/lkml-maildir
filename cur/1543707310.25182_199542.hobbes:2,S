I'm getting ready to contact Dell (after I work through my work and
  homework backlog.  Ugh).
Firt off, how do I determine what all is broken in the DSDT/BIOS?  I know
  that the kernel refuses to use the APIC due to a 'broken BIOS'
  (Feb 16 14:38:31 petrus Dell Inspiron with broken BIOS detected. Refusing to enable the local APIC.)
  (Anyone know what I need to ask Dell to do to fix this?)  I also know
  that the fan isn't reported in ACPI, and that I've not gotten it to
  suspend to RAM successfully (I've not gotten it to suspend to disk
  successfully either, but I think that's due to software and/or my
  issues, not the BIOS/DSDT).
Also, any pointers on *how* to ask?  The above should cover the what;
  who's successfully gotten a vendor (esp. Dell) to issue a fixed BIOS
  and/or DSDT, and how did you go about it?
Thanks!
