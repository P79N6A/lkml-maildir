Hmm. I'd love to get rid of the warnings, because they obviously mean that 
I don't look at warnings much at all ("they're all bogus"), but this patch 
must be against some version of arch/powerpc/kernel/head_64.S that I've 
never seen.
That "do_stab_bolted_pSeries" function is in a totally different place for 
me, and the index that git diff mentiones of 47fcff1 doesn't exist in my 
tree (so I've literally never had it).
