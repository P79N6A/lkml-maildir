Nope, that is not there yet. My plan was to make it dump block layer
structures, but it would probably not help for this case (as the io
would likely be stuck in the per-cpu queue waiting for completion). I'll
try and add the debug info and include info for the call function
structures.

To me as well, but we are not looking at the exact same base (but close
enough). I'll play around with the ppc64 today, it's been very handy for
finding memory ordering problems in the past :-)

Good
