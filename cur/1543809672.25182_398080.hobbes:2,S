What about adding more bits to check on? The PID to lookup the task_t and
then some extra bits to uniquely identify the actual task.

It was for this case I suggested maintaining a list of waiters within the
kernel on each task_t. The adding has to be done FUTEX_WAIT so the adding
operation needs to be protected.

I admit your solution is a good one. The only drawback - besides being
untraditional - is that memory corruption can leave futexes locked at
exit.
