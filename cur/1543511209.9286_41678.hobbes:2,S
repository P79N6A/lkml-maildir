I have not seen any duplicated characters. Just blocks of missing bytes.
I switched to using a faster computer to test things with, leaving the
production server alone. I don't see any overrun errors in
/proc/tty/driver/serial on the receiving system at all now.
For a while I believed that I could fall back to XModem1K when the data
transfer got large. That throttles throughput enough that it worked. But on
the new system I can't send even a small 46K file without losing data in
the middle.
What can I do to find out what's happening here? Both are 2.2.12, 16550A,
56K modems, 115.2K crtcts. One system is Celeron 333, other is K6-II 200.
Both are now test systems, so I can do whatever will diagnose this.
