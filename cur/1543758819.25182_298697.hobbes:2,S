Only davem, AFAIK.  All the other trees get auto-sucked into -mm for
testing.  Generally the owners of those trees make the decision as to which
of their code has been sufficiently well-tested for a Linus merge, and when
that should happen.

That's basically what happens now, except I don't physically send the
patches from those 32 bk trees to Linus.
