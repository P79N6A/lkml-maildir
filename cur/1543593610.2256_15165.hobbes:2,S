Yes, it was discussed on the axp-list a while back. After that I've
hacked the ld for -taso, and it went into official binutils about a year
ago.
$ ld -v
GNU ld version 2.10.91 (with BFD 2.10.91.0.2)
$ ld -help
...
ld: emulation specific options:
elf64alpha: 
  -Bgroup               Selects group name lookup rules for DSO
...
  -taso                 Load executable in the lower 31-bit addressable
                          virtual address range
...

Exactly. However, there are situations when you have only two options:
rewrite from scratch or use -taso. Netscape vs. mozilla is a good example. :-)
