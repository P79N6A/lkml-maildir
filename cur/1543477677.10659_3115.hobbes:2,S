I think we're starting to close in on something here...
We saw a patch on linuxmama that recognizes buggy Award PCI bioses and
disables the PCI bios in this case. Although that patch didn't recognize
our bios as being buggy, we went ahead and compiled up a 2.0.36 kernel.
Running the test that normally reboots a stock 2.0.36 kernel within 30
minutes, we ran overnight without any problems.
We're starting up more systems with this combination. I'll post the results
later.
Thanks,
Al Youngwerth
