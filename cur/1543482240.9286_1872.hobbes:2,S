A projected event would be "will release". This is now.

The "enables ... to" construct must die, but "seamlessly" is good.
This isn't a snow job. Seamlessness is important.
"Samba" looks better than "SAMBA"
: * Compatibility with Windows NT and BSD filesystems lets Linux 2.2
:   seamlessly access data on NTFS-format and UFS-format hard disks.
:   With Samba, Linux can transparently replace all NT Server functions,
:   including file-sharing, print-sharing and domain authentication.
I suppose we must slip CONFIG_SMB_SERVER into 2.2.1 to be honest.

That is stretching the truth. 386 hardware is not useful with
any operating system. The performance/watt is way too low.
That "cheap" 386 DNS server raises your air conditioning costs.

Time is money. It will cost you time to use Internet support.
Also consider ISP and phone use.
> Why "contracts"?
That is how traditional support works.
