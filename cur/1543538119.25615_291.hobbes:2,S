The kernel warning messages won't stop until the banging(*) stops.
(*) "hdparm -T -t" or anything I/O sensitive with a read/write buffer
below 1 MB/or so (I don't know what the exact figure is, but it is
reproducible).

No, just that I can't run the kernel in question because my network
modules won't compile. I'm sorry if I misslead you.
BTW, Mark Hahn had some interesting H/W points (from a private E-mail) I
have to check before I file my next failure report to you/l-k (I don't
have access to the H/W in question right now, but I will test it later
in the week).
