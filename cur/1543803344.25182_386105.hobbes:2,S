Works in what sense? Are you able to reproduce the oops?
It is quite difficult to reproduce the oops, since it makes the whole system 
freeze (the fs part is oopsed, and then all processes depend on it). Hence 
I've called it "hard" . It may be captured with a serial console, I 'll give 
it a try..
