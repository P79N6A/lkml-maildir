I've rewritten my example request-key program to get a key holding the
real key creation program from a key in the user's session key, so that, say,
a desktop such as KDE could supply a GUI front end.

So as me, I can do:
	keyctl add user request-key:create /tmp/request-key-dhowells.sh @s
And then:
	keyctl request user metal:copper
And the request-key program will change to my UID/GID, look around for the a
key telling it which program to run, and then run my default script.
