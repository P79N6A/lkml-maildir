I didn't say it was a good idea, just that it was possible to do what he
wants.

I totally agree, whenever I use cdrecord I use dev=/dev/whatever and will
continue to do so until it no longer works. But if that ever happens I
would hope another tool would take it's place. And contrary to what he
believes I also burned as a non-root user so it wasn't able to set itself
to rt or mlock itself into memory and I've never burned a coaster that I
could blame on either case even on my slowest machines.
