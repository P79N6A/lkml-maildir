Hello, Jeff!
Yes, you are right that the list grew too much.
I, for example, have a sil 3112 controller that made problems (mod15) in 
the past (crash on big tranfers). But I upgraded the BIOS (and it shows me 
that even sil firmware was updated) and the problem disappeard.
So, I'll be glad to test this patch, but I can't because now it works very 
good (I manualy remove the disks from blaklist because they have a match 
in the list).
Thanks goes to Silicon Image people that, finally, they release a patch to 
fix this problem.
My motherboard is Intel.
Thanks Jeff.
