Hello,
Just some near random thoughts that might help you here...
Are you logging the syslog on remote machines (@hostname entries in the
syslogd.conf)? I've found in the past that that helps against the loss of
log file tails.
Are the boxes SMP, and are the disks maybe in (IDE) PIO mode sometimes? If
that is possible, then you should try the 14pre15, because Alan has
recently fixed a lockup bug for that case.
Did you use kernels with minimal hardware support compiled-in (Just
the minimum what you need, from the hardware that is present, and without
using kernel modules and kerneld)?
Did you try shuffling around with the hardware, different network cards,
different mainboard/CPU combinations, other/new DIMMs, different power
supplies (hooked up to different power groups, different/newer UPS-es)),
to see when the problem gets worse or less (might help find the problem).
Even though it used to work perfectly, the PC hardware could have become
flakey since you ran the 2.0.x kernels (CPU fans are not the only things
that can break down), and the power net supply and/or UPS (110V/220V) can
have become worse, which can also have an influence on system stability.
Also, are you running X11 on the servers (if so, I suggest you stop doing
that, the XFree86 binaries have direct access to all hardware, so a bug in
that binary can wreak havoc, and in addition VGA cards can lockup the PC
hardware in some cases)? Id even suggest running the PCs without video
cards (dont forget to compile a new kernel without console support, or you
will be left with a significant slowdown of your server).
Good luck finding the problem,
Jelle.
