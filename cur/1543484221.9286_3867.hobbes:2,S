<nitpick> we ignore low 3 bits, so it can be turned into 256 (erm, 260)
bytes if we allow AND and 64 bytes if we allow SAR (used anyway).

	On 286??? Anyway, 32+32 (we use only one direction each time) is
not too terrible. Moreover, it follows busy waiting with lots of port
accesses.

	Erm... IIRC PLIP used in 1.0 was canned exactly because of
incompatibility with original protocol. Maybe we should follow 386BSD here
and allow several protocols selected by ioctl() (from ifconfig). Maybe we
might even add negotiation there.

	Hrm... PLIP becoming a line discipline... Interesting. It doesn't
fit too well into this scheme - we can't do transfers in both directions
simultaneously.
