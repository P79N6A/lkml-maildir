That's a different issue.
My point here is that we do not know how the latest gcc available in the 
year 2010 might transform this code, and how a likely/unlikely placed 
there might influence gcc's optimizations then.
If this is in hotpath code with a measurable speedup when using 
likely/unlikely with a current gcc then it's worth it.
But otherwise it brings no real advantage today and the longterm effects 
are not predictable.
