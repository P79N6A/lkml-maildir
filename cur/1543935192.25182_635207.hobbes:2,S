Ok, got it.
But I can't open the device multiple times, can I?
Like, there's a daemon listening on volume up/down and other
multimedia keys for example, and it can't listen to the same
eventX as a daemon that's watching for power/sleep buttons, --
instead, they should be combined into the same executable.
Unless there's a way to multiplex the events...
(Hmm, this becoming quite... ugly.  Oh well.)
By the way, where are all the capabilities of input devices
documented?
