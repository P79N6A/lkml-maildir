Two reasons that I can think of off the top of my head.
One of them I mentioned above: because that precludes the possibility of
someone sending me a direct copy to draw my attention to something which
they think needs it, unless they send it separately from the list copy.
(This does not especially apply on the kernel-related mailing lists,
since no one is likely to think I am particularly worth drawing in to
any discussion there anytime soon, but it has come up elsewhere and the
basic principle is the same.)
The other is that this would lead to duplicate copies of the same reply
in the mailing list folder, which is ugly at best, especially with
respect to proper threading.

It is indeed not enabled, and when I check the config for the 2.6.23.1
kernel where USB works, I find that it is enabled there. I will test the
result of enabling it in the current kernel. If I don't have an answer
by the end of the day, I probably won't be able to get one until at
least Tuesday.

Oh, I agree - that is a large part of why I posted a "full" description
of only one problem initially, rather than all three in a single mail.
