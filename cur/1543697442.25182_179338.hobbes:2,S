Hi Andrew,
Thanks for your reply. I looked into the boundary alignment issue. 
Observed something strange happening;
I wrote my own kernel module and then;
1. retrieved the block size = 4096 using block_size(struct block_device
*bdev) 
2. in the user application i did a lseek by 4906 (block size seek) 
3. then found the address of the variable i wanted to read into, to be
block 
   size aligned.
However, the read still seems to fail with the O_DIRECT flag specified. 
The same check _passes if i do not specify the flag in open of the
device.
Boundary issues seem to be not the cause of failure here.
Would have any more kind suggestions on something that i should do or
could be missing on?
Regards
Dhruv
