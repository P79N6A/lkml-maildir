If you focus on the system startup speed problem, the stats are quite a 
bit simpler.  If you can take a snapshot of every mmap page in memory 
shortly after startup (and verify that no page frames were stolen during 
startup) and save that, you could just prefault all those pages in, in a 
single sweep, at the next boot.
