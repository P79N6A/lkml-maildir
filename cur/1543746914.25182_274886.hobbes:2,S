This fix is not correct!

fix->smem_start: Although I agree VGA_FB_PHYS is not the correct value on
machines other than PC, VGA_MAP_MEM(VGA_FB_PHYS) is not appropriate either,
because fix->smem_start is supposed to be a CPU _physical_ address, not a
virtual address.
However, this value isn't really used, except by (very rare) userspace that
wants to mmap the frame buffer through /dev/mem instead of /dev/fb*, so an
incorrect value doesn't really harm.

ioremap(): VGA_MAP_MEM() already a _virtual_ address:
| include/asm-alpha/vga.h:#define VGA_MAP_MEM(x)   ((unsigned long) ioremap((x), 0))
| include/asm-arm/vga.h:#define VGA_MAP_MEM(x)     (PCIMEM_BASE + (x))
| include/asm-i386/vga.h:#define VGA_MAP_MEM(x) (unsigned long)phys_to_virt(x)
| include/asm-ia64/vga.h:#define VGA_MAP_MEM(x)    ((unsigned long) ioremap((x), 0))
| include/asm-mips/vga.h:#define VGA_MAP_MEM(x) ((unsigned long)0xb0000000 + (unsigned long)(x))
| include/asm-ppc/vga.h:#define VGA_MAP_MEM(x) (x + vgacon_remap_base)
| include/asm-ppc64/vga.h:#define VGA_MAP_MEM(x) ((unsigned long) ioremap((x), 0))
| include/asm-sparc64/vga.h:#define VGA_MAP_MEM(x) (x)
| include/asm-x86_64/vga.h:#define VGA_MAP_MEM(x) (unsigned long)phys_to_virt(x)
Doing a double ioremap(), or ioremap(phys_to_virt()) will break for sure...
BTW, on (PReP/CHRP) PPC ioremap() on ISA memory space `just works' because
__ioremap() adds _ISA_MEM_BASE to the passed pointer if it's smaller than
16*1024*1024. And yes, vga16fb used to work fine on my CHRP LongTrail
(before the machine itself died :-(.
Yes, ISA memory space is a mess to do right in a portable way...
