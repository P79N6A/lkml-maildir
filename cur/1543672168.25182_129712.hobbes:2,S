How does it work?  What restrictions does it have, and
what compromises were made?
+#define PERCPU_POOL_SIZE 32768
What's this?
The current implementation of kmalloc_per_cpu() turned out to be fairly
disappointing because of the number of derefs which were necessary to get at
the data in fastpaths.   How does this implementation compare?
Thanks.
