Normally people expect that shutting the lid on a laptop will cause it to 
go to sleep.  If you want different behavior, that's okay too...

So you want a mode in which the input devices are suspended without remote 
wakeup.  Remote wakeup settings are configurable via 
/sys/devices/.../power/wakeup.  At this point nobody has settled on a
new API for suspending the devices.  It's quite possible that different 
drivers or different buses will use their own individual APIs.
