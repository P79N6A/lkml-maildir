Subject: Need more symbols to be exported out of kernel

Hello!
   I have implemented file_operations->write() function for reiserfs for
   linux kernel v2.4, and it seems I need these symbols to be exported
   out of kernel for a case when reiserfs is built as a module:
   generic_osync_inode
   remove_suid
   block_commit_write
   I need block_commit_write just because generic_commit_write is doing
   some extra stuff I'd better do myself.
   Will the patch to export these symbols be accepted? (should these be
   exported as GPL sysmbols or not?).
   You can look a my current code on top of 2.4.20-pre2+ at

Bye,
