Initial dbench testing on a 3.5gb box showed a decrease in performance.
Which did not make sense to me, since there would be no reason to run
tq_disk if the buffer is not locked as is. In fact, I would have
expected this small change to increase performance slightly (which is
why I did it of course), we would be able to build longer queues. I
didn't do any queue monitoring, but I noted that __make_request scan
times were _smaller_ with this change. Which really doesn't make sense
at all :-)
So I'm suspecting a weird mm interaction, I'll drop more info as I find
out. Unfortunately I've been disconnected from above box since this
afternoon, so haven't been able to test since...
