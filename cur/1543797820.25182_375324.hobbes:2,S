From what I can tell, it's too late in the callstack for us to change
the read ops for this device to be the other one.  The problem is (and
Andi can correct me if I'm wrong), some boxes basically have incomplete
MCFG acpi tables (the tables do not describe all PCI busses that are
present in the box).  But we don't realize this until we are about to do
the read function.
I remember I looked into trying to set this up at probe/init time, and
it was almost impossible to do so, due to the structure of the code.
However, I might have missed something, and if you can point how to do
this easier, please do.
As it is, this patch is needed to fix boxes that do not work at all with
the current kernel.
thanks,
