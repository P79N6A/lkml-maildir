This is wrong -- if the buffer is not queued because we are out of
free request slots, it has still already been locked at this point
(and _Req). So what happens the next time someone calls
sync_page_buffers on this buffer head? It finds the buffer locked,
assumed it has been queued, and does __wait_on_buffer(). Boom,
you're stuck.
