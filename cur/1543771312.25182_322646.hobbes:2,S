21 days ago I bought a le.ads d/base for 199$USD.
14 days ago I started mark.eting.
10 days ago I got my first check in the post.
Up to today's date I've had 35 checks.
35 join/ups in 10 days.
I would like to tell you about it.
It was easy.
I am not very good at mark/eting. I was given
help to write my sales_message and advice how
promote my business without cost.
---------------------------------------------
You should try this "new" and "unique" way of
getting sign/ups.
You have to do some mark.eting work but it's
easy and it works - fast.
I tried many mark/eting and le.ad companies.
Most of them chea.ted me. This one doesn't.
