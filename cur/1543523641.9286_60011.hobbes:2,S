Hi,
Experienced two lockups within say 12 hours running
CivCTP and xmms. I wasn't even near the computer when 
the lockup with xmms occurred (wakes me up in the morning :).
Tried Alt-SysRQ-<K,U,....> and so on. I didn't help.
This PC is not networked so I could not verify that
this is not graphics card related although I've tried
most of the 2.3.20-2.3.40 (all of 2.3.30-2.3.40)
without any problems (until now). I think the nvidia
drivers are quite stable, here at least.
Patch-2.3.40 contains updates to the ensoniq-1371 driver,
maybe that's the problem.
Pleas e-mail me if there is more info I need to supply to
make sense of this. I don't have regular acces to this
mailing list (can't take that email load).
Soft: Redhat 6.1.
Hardware: (as reported by 2.2.14)
