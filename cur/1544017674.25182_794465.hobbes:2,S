With the exported headers we at least have a clear definition
what part of the headers are actually exported.
So what we have now is a much better base to cut off from.
And there is plenty of room for improvements but it requires
someone with understanding of the kernel side and the user side to do
this.
I for once find it hard to judge what is really used by user space and
not. Diving into glibc does not help as userspace is much more than
glibc although glibc is an important 'customer' here.
