Hello all,
	I reported this problem back in 2.6.0 and it still seems to exist
in 2.6.3.  Basically, my firewire hard drive no longer wants to work.
I've googled around, and came up with another post to the mailing list
suggesting setting serialize_io to 1 in the sbp2 driver, but that didn't
help at all.
	This has happened with two separate ohci controllers each on a
separate machine.  The first is identified as a lucent FW323 chip, and the
second is an Audigy firewire port.  The drive works with both cards under
2.4.25.
	This is the output from dmesg:
