Oops, I didn't realize that there could be repeated addresses :(
I did a test running 500000 lookups with the original function and my 
own and compared the results from both functions looking for any 
differences. The test program was fed from /proc/kallsyms from my 
machine. Because there were no aliases there, the result was ok and I 
felt confident about the algorithm.
Anyway, at first glance your patch looks right, and I don't think there 
will be any performance implications from it, unless there can be 
thousands of aliases for the same address :)
