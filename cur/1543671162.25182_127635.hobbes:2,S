For their smaller devices, Xilinx has a free "WebPack" which is a 
complete Verilog synthesizer (I don't know if it does VHDL), as well as 
place & route, of course.  I think it'll do up to Virtex II 250.  It 
also tends use fewer gates for a given design than the version of 
Leonardo Spectrum we have.  It just doesn't have a simulator, which is 
vital to any good development process.  Also, the Web Pack only runs 
under Windows.  Maybe it'll work with WINE?
I've been working on my own 32-bit CPU design for FPGA lately.  Maybe we 
can get Linux to run on it.  :)
