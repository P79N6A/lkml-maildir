Nop, seems like it is hugetlb bug fixed by Adam 
commit 516dffdcd8827a40532798602830dfcfc672294c
[PATCH] Fix get_unmapped_area and fsync for hugetlb shm segments
I've disregard it thoughtlessly so Adam marks it specific for powerpc/ia64.
(hmm.. i donno realy why, huge pages should be alined anyway and if i 
understend it correctly it may not be if is_file_hugepages() fails)
As of "junk" just before the BUG this again IIUC because o-direct staff
catches this issue before hugetlb.
