That still requires getty's and minicom etc to be modified, and as
I point out in my follow up mail, not having getty understand it
can be a security issue.
Since we do have spare bits in cflag, I see no reason not to use
them.  If we use these spare bits, we stand a good chance that we'll
have the desired behaviour without modifying userland.
I've seen the occasional alternative suggestion, but no one has yet
put forward a coherent argument against using termios's cflags to
control the handshake mode.
