But a function can be called from many places... how will it know which
of TASK_{INTERRUPTIBLE,UNINTERRUPTIBLE,KILLABLE} to use? It's bad enough
already, with functions which are _sometimes_ called from an
uninterruptible call path using TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE even when they are
called from a different call path which _could_ handle being
interrupted.
I wonder if we should handle interruptibility (and killability) in the
same was as we handle preemptability -- that is, keep a count in the
task structure. Increase it by one when you can't be
{interrupted,killed,preempted} and it gets observed by all the functions
you call until the count is decremented all the way to zero.
So upon signal delivery you look at task->uninterruptible_count and
queue the signal if it's non-zero. Or if it's a fatal signal you look at
task->unkillable_count.
