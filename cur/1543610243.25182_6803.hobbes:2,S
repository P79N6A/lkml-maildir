<sigh>  Again, this isn't true.  I build modules against our 
kernel-source RPM tree all the time, and I *never* do a make distclean. 
  If I did, it would screw the tree permanently.  If you are basing your 
arguments about what you saw with 6.2, then you are sorely out of date 
(hell, that was still a 2.2 kernel system).  Things have improved a lot 
since then.  The one overridding rule of working with a tree like we 
ship though, is *NEVER* do anything in the tree itself.  That tree is 
assembled to provide *ALL* the kernel versions and includes for all the 
kernels we ship.  However, even doing a make dep in the tree will blow 
important parts away.  Download my module build kit and see what I'm 
talking about because you currently obviously *don't* know what I'm 
talking about.
