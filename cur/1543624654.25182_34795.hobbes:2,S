Add: A DMA block of 65536 bytes comes out as 0 bytes in the chipset.

Interesting - any idea which you've found a problem. One errata we see in
the Linux case with specific drive/board combinations is a
transfer completing but the DMA busy bit never being cleared. The next
DMA transaction is shifted by 4 bytes starting with the last dword of
the previous I/O (as if the DMA engine got something stuck in a FIFO)

(Except with extra glue - eg on Dell boxes)
