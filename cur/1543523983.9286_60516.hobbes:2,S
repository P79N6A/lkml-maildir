Hello,
Jan 29 09:57:36 xar in.ntalkd[19193]: connect from earthvision.asu.edu
Jan 29 09:57:36 xar talkd[19193]: Bad protocol version 0
Jan 29 09:57:36 xar talkd[19193]: sendto: Invalid argument
Jan 29 09:57:36 xar kernel: Remind Kuznetsov, he has to repair in.ntalkd
eventually
This is the first time I've ever seen this message. The server that gave
these messages did not crash, but around the same time other computers
indicate that they temporarily lost their (network) connection with
xar. The server runs linux 2.3.39, in.ntalkd is the one shipped with
debian woody.
Another thing to add to the todo list for 2.3.x?
Met vriendelijke groet,
Guus Sliepen.
