This is correct; with devfs, creation of device nodes during module 
loading was synchronous, so it was always (or nearly always) complete 
before modprobe returned. With udev, creation of device nodes is 
completely asynchronous, and may happen at _any_ time after the module 
has been loaded.
The real solution here is for people to re-think their system startup 
processes; if you need mixer settings applied at startup, then build a 
small script somewhere in /etc/hotplug.d or /etc/dev.d that applies them 
to the mixer _when it appears_.
