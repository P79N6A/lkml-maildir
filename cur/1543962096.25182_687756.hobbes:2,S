The information present in the current MAINTAINERS file is such that
given the name(s) of the source files affected by a patch, one can
look up the appropriate mailing list(s) and maintainer(s) to send the
patch to. Information about embedded maintainer(s) is different: it's
not about maintaining specific source files but about general
discussions with regard to kernel changes for embedded systems. Maybe
there should be two sections in the MAINTAINERS file, one for
maintainers of specific source trees and another section for
coordinators of specific usage scenario's of the Linux kernel ?
Bart.
