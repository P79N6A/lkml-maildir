    aty128fb works for me here with:

    Thank you!
    There are a few glitches, but I've been unable to pin down
anything serious as the fbdev patch's fault.  I'm still playing with
things (like Antonio Daplas' patches).  I'll give a more full report
later.
    FWIW, the fbdev patch applies with a few minor offsets to 2.5.50
except for the attached patch, which I extracted from bk.  So if you
apply this patch in *reverse* to a clean 2.5.50 tree, the fbdev patch
should then apply okay (patch complained about a reversed hunk in
fbcon.c, but it should be harmless, I think.)
