The same here.
I applied the patch mentioned by Christian Volkmann in the thread "Re: 
2.6.22-rc1 does not boot on VIA C3_2 cause of X86_CMPXCHG64 II"  on May 
19th 2007. Since then I did not have a crash any more. Touch wood!
Could anyone explain to me what CMPXCHG64 / cx8 is and what happens if 
the kernel has been compiled to use it but the CPU does not have it? 
Especially if the CPU like the C7 supports it, but it's disabled? Would 
random crashes be a plausible effect?
Regards,
claas
