I'd just like to clear up some confusion here.
Under this cset is a change that adds '-g' to the top-level make flags.
This cset, although it has my name and comments against it is actually
a patch that added the serial drivers and extra bits that Ingo sent to
Linus (and Linus kindly credited it back to me, and took the comments
from one of my patch submissions for the serial drivers.)
The addition of '-g' is not, and has never been in my serial patches;
please do not direct comments about the '-g' to me.  Any problems
relating to the serial changes should be forwarded to me.
Thanks.
