Hello, I would like to know why you put this two functions:
void scheduling_functions_start_here(void) { }
...
void scheduling_functions_end_here(void) { }
why you put 'case TASK_RUNNING'
switch (prev->state) {
                case TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE:
                        if (signal_pending(prev)) {
                                prev->state = TASK_RUNNING;
                                break;
                        }
                default:
                        del_from_runqueue(prev);
                case TASK_RUNNING:
}
and the last one:
in the function schedule() you always use this syntax:
-----
if (a_condition)
    goto bebe;
bebe_back
bebe:
    do_bebe();
    goto bebe_back;
------
why not just doing:
   
   if (a_condition)
         do_bebe();
I know that goto's are better but finaly you are jumping to a function and
then calling the function. I think you can improve performance doing this.
