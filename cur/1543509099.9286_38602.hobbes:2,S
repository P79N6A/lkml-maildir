Subject: Kernel 2.3.12 Error with display on Mach 64 implimentation

	All,
	I was wondering if there was a fix to a problem I have been having with the
new kernel 2.3.12. Whenever I use the 2.3 kernel, my display is distorted. I
am getting no oops, and I have recompiled with out frame buffers and without
any VGS support at all (console is completely unselected) and I am still
getting the display errors. I was wondering if the new graphic it displays
during kernel bootup is in any way pushing my refresh rate out of sync
(since it does display kinda odd, but not with the complete disarray that
the X-system does).
	Is there a fix or has it already been reported?
Thanks
Bruce Werner
