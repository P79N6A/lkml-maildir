The crash problem seems to also affect usb-storage devices.  Hard lockups
on an SMP machine under 2.4.4, 2.4.5 and 2.4.6pre3.  Dropped back to 2.4.3
and all is well.  Haven't tried on UP or the -ac kernels.  Have been
waiting to see if anyone saw this elsewhere as I know that usb-storage
still has some "issues".  :-)
