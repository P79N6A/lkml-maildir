The hammer has an average age of 13yrs and is difficult to turn off,
unfortunately.
Rather than bugging the author of the driver card, we've actually
been trying to fix it, down to rewriting the firmware. So for
this purpose I/we am/are the driver maintainer thanks. However,
there are limitations like bus speed which mean that in practice
if we receive a large enough number of small packets each second,
the box will saturate.
My point was merely that some applications (and using a linux
box as a router is not that 'unusual') want to deprioritize
different things under resource starvation. Changing the default,
in an unconfigurable way, isn't a great idea. Sure dealing
with external resource exhaustions for hosts is indeed a good
idea. I was just suggesting that it wasn't always what you
wanted to do.
Not sure this required jumping down my throat.
