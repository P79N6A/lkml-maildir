>   2) How should an application be written to not be killed by OOM?
OOM isn't an application matter. The kernel has to choose between
allowing overcommit on the basis it might run out of memory and have to
kill stuff, or that it won't in which case an applicatio which correctly
handles malloc() and similar failures will not be killed (unless it is
out of space on a stack grow which is a C language flaw as you can't
catch that event in C)
It's configured by /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
0 - try and spot obviously dumb allocations
1 - anything goes
2 - strictly control resource commit
