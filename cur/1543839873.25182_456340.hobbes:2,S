My point was that when you have lots of containers
their summary memory limit can be much higher then available RAM.
This allows bursts of memory usage for containers, since
it is very unlikely for all of them to consume the memory
simulatenously. E.g. hosters usually oversell memory
say 2 times on the node.
So the question was whether it is possbile to overcommit memory
with NUMA emulation?
Thanks,
Kirill
