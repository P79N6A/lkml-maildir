I'm following this discussion with a lot of interest. I'm working on a
user space tool for managing groups of processes in order to do
per-group accounting (ELSA). A release should be done quickly. To get
accounting values I'm using BSD per-process accounting and also the CSA
patch. Thus, I'm not directly working on accounting values and the
infrastructure provided by Christoph and CSA patch fit well with my
needs.
Best regards,
Guillaume
