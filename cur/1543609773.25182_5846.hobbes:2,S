Something is broken along the way then, as I have:
..?
Grrr. Something wicked (windowsian) has damaged all
the tabs when I was inlining the patches.
Hm. Attaching the patches mangles (uuencodes) them and
inlining them damages the tabs. So. Please get the patch tarball

You're right, the patches tend not to apply to non-5.05 versions.
However, applying them to 2.4.14 doesn't give me the above. What
exactly is 2.4.x-current, and where can I get it?
I'll do a patch set against 5.05c, should rmk or tytso request it.
Unless you're also a serial maintainer of some description?
