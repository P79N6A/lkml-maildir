Understood.
BTW, some drivers have taken the approch to add MSI self-tests
inside of the driver to ensure correct option of MSI on a given
machine.  There's a lot of resistence to that, the reasons for
which I grok fully, but I'm not sure other suggestions such as
black lists are any better.
Given current experience maybe white-lists are in fact the way
to go.
