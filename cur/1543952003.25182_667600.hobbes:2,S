Subject: [patch 1/2] hw_random: allow rng_dev_read() to return hardware errors.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Ralph Wuerthner <rwuerthn@de.ibm.com>
The api for hardware random number generators is currently limited to
devices that never fail. If the hardware is registered as a source for
random numbers it has to work. This prevents the use of i/o based
random number devices where the i/o might fail.
Add a check for errors after the read from a hardware random number device.
This patch is required to support large random numbers retrieved
from the CEX2C cards on System z.
