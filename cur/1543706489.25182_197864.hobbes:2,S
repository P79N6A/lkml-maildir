Hello,
Thnks
>printk("%ld%ld",loff_t >> (sizeof(long) * 8), loff_t << sizeof(long) * 8 >>
>sizeof(long) * 8);
Well I had tried it but I got
the follwing compilation errors while trying to add that code:
invalid operands to binary >>
invalid operands to binary <<
I assume maybe it is a problems with the flags I use:
I use gcc 3.2.2 and the flags are:
O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common
-DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ -DNOKERNEL
regards,
sting
