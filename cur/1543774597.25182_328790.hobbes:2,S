It's greg's pci-somethingortheotheraboutacpi-collection-02 patch (sorry
don't remember it exactly).
It's basically replacing the PCI bus root resources with new resources.
These aren't then attached to the resource tree.  However, PCI will
attach the child resources to the (unattached) bus resources.
Hence, all PCI resources remain invisible.
