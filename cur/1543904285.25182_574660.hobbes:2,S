hm, CFS should already offer reasonable long-term SMP fairness. It 
certainly works on a dual-core box, i just started 3 tasks of the same 
priority on 2 CPUs, and on vanilla 2.6.23-rc1 the distribution is this:
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
 7084 mingo     20   0  1576  248  196 R   67  0.0   0:50.13 loop
 7083 mingo     20   0  1576  244  196 R   66  0.0   0:48.86 loop
 7085 mingo     20   0  1576  244  196 R   66  0.0   0:49.45 loop
so each task gets a perfect 66% of CPU time.
prior CFS, we indeed did a 50%/50%/100% split - so for example on 
v2.6.22:
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
 2256 mingo     25   0  1580  248  196 R  100  0.0   1:03.19 loop
 2255 mingo     25   0  1580  248  196 R   50  0.0   0:31.79 loop
 2257 mingo     25   0  1580  248  196 R   50  0.0   0:31.69 loop
but CFS has changed that behavior.
I'll check your 10-tasks-on-8-cpus example on an 8-way box too, maybe we 
regressed somewhere ...
