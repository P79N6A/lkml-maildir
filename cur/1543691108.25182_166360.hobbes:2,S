How does it strike you to have these:
 - compile support for any CPU which doesn't break the target
   (including slow it in some serious way)
 - drop support for any CPU except the target
It seems to me that this is what the vendors want (as general as possible)
and the size limited users want (small is beautiful).
Fitting the code to this model could be done gradually and hopefully with
some macros to prevent too much ugly ifdef code.
