I'm sorry, but I don't understand how it's going to change anything. For
sure, it makes your life easier because you don't have to shutdown all your
programs that have files opened in R/W mode. But in the end, you will have
to shutdown something to remount the partition in R/O mode and usually you
don't want or can't afford to do that.
