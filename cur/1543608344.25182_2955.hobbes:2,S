Ah, I was going to ask you to try with:
	/sbin/hdparm -d1 -u1 -W1 -c1 /dev/hda
(my settings, of course not safe for journaling fs, safe to use it only
with ext2 and I -W0 back during /etc/init.d/halt) but I assumed you were
using the same hdparm settings in -ac and mainline. Never mind, good
that it's solved now :).
