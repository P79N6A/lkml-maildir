Memory banks can exist without a CPU present.  The places where you can
plug in memory don't change and so the memory hierarchy can be described.

That's the cost of doing business.
There is an inexpensive solution: finally make the vdso concept a bit
more flexible.  You could add a vdso call to get the processor count.
The vdso code itself can use a data page mapped in from the kernel.
This page (read-only at userlevel) would contain global information such
as processor count and topology.
But we're getting IMO off topic here.  That's a separate and far more
complicated issue.
Here we now have the concrete issue that determining the CPU count is
terribly expensive and there is a simple proposal to make it faster by
keeping /sys/devices/system/cpu/ free from anything but cpu* directories.
