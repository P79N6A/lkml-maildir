Subject: Areca ARC-1120 Raid6 card - did they borrow raid6int.uc ?

Tom's Hardware reviews a RAID6 hardware board:
http://www.tomshardware.com/storage/20041227/areca-raid6-01.html#raid_level_6_array_in_detail
I have no idea of wether the computation of the P and Q syndromes are standard 
and well-known or not in the industry. I only know of Peter Anvin's 
implementation:
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hpa/raid6.pdf
My question is: if they are not, since it seems from the picture at Tom's that 
Areca may have a similar implementation, did they borrow code ?
