Subtly different code is the worst kind of code to be duplicating. It
really needs improving, I think.

It's just the wrong thing to do if the page has been set writeback with
a valid mapping. Presently we don't do any mapping specific accounting
in that path, but we could.
But now that I look at your patch, I don't think it is going to work.
end_swap_bio_write can be called from interrupt context, so you can't
lock the page, and you can't take any of those swap specific spinlocks
either.
You say that SetPageError makes the processes die unexpectedly? How and
where? We use SetPageError for IO errors, and it doesn't mean the page
has errors AFAIK.
The best policy would probably be to keep the end_page_writeback path as
it is, and then detect the PageError in the swap out path somewhere.
