I will try to do that now. Do you think this can have anything to do with me
actually having a rather large root partition (76GB)? I will try with two
33GB partitions this time (it might have something to do with it - but on
the other hand it is working working with the Debian pre-compiled kernel).
Well, let's see what I find out. I'll keep you posted.

Well, since you're using raid1, you should be able to pass a root=/dev/hda1
(or whatever your / is located) using the same kernel and at least boot
using this kernel. Then maybe you can use dmesg etc.. to see what the driver
is actually doing. From your original post, it looks like you're using Lilo,
so you'll need to boot using the old kernel first and change the lilo entry.
