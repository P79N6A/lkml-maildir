Have you actually tested this? Well, probably not, it is hard to test
this. I assume you want cpu not to overheat during panics...

This is useless... cpu_relax is rep nop, that only helps on
hyperthreading-enabled CPUS. Anything new enough to support
hyperthreading already has good thermal protection.

Same here. halt() would make sense here.
But this probably needs documentation, and centralizing into
kill_current_cpu() function, or something.
