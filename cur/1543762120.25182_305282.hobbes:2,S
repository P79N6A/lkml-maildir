And connector's listeners will continue to listen it's events.
But there will not be any event.
Like application will continue to be bound to the IP and listen
for incomming connection, but there will not be any connection.

It is super-user who only is allowed to turn it off and even listen for
events,
since only super-user is allowed to bind socket to multicast netlink
group.
Super-user should not be allowed to control it's system?

With CBUS it costs nothing to always send notifications,
but I still do not see a point of disallowing super-user to stop
fork notifications using arbitrary application.
