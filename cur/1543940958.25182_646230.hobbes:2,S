Even if they do (I don't know if it's true or not) it does not really 
matter because on modern hard disks/systems it does not cost less to 
transfer 1MB versus 4K. The actual threshold seems to be rising in fact.
The only drawback is that the swap might be full sooner, but 
I would actually consider this a feature because it would likely
end many prolonged oom death dances much sooner.
