Ok - I'd love the ability to diagnose an entire system. Furthermore, it'd be
very cool if it were possible to profile another process, like strace -p
pid.
I think this means looking at 'virtual counters' for arbitrary processes.
Would this be possible?
I currently have a client using a 2.6.7 kernel and they have performance
problems and applications I can't recompile. It'd be very good if I could
spot which of their many application is thrashing the cache.

Ahhhh, I see. With this line things work as intended:
d_control.cpu_control.evntsel[count] = v | (1 << 16) | (!count << 22) | (unit << 8);

Indeed. Thanks. I'll make a P6PerfCtr and an AMDPerfCtr and a P4PerfCtr. The
pentium 1/2 people can work it out for themselves :-)
