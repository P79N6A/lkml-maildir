Well, let's try an refocus on what I was trying to say.
The Macintosh (NeXTStep too) is one of the only graphics
system that had correct color handling, cross screen promotion
of windows, etc..., it is shows when you use and program
for that machine.
Photoshop/Illustrator wouldn't have come if it wasn't for
the quality of the API and you've got to give credit that community
for doing it well the first time around.
Aesthetics and organizational psychology was also an important
aspect of the GUI design. These benifits show when you use the machine.
I certainly can't say that about X, in that the Unix community in
general is extremely narrow minded about technical details without
any regard to the more human aspects of GUI environments. 
That's extremely stupid.
The Unix community would learn alot from Macintosh, BeOS and NeXTStep.
The GUIs that they put out are highly integrated psychologically/technically
and it shows when one uses it. It's simply.
I cannot say that about X. GNOME/Enlightenment at least make some kind of
attempt at being fun and easy to use.
