Not all cards have all features, not all users wants to enable all
features.

As Alan already pointed out thats assumption is invalid.

Yes and it should stay like that. If Richard had wanted all those
features enabled per default when an MVME setting was selected, he
would have done it in the config.in file, which is perfectly valid to
do so today.

Yes I have objections. I thought I had made this clear a long time
ago: Go play with another port and leave the m68k port alone.
Thank you
