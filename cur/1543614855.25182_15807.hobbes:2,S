I would expect the audio dropouts to be due to disk read latencies
and insufficiently large buffers in the audio app, and/or failure
of that audio app to mlock itself down.
If it's scheduling latency, which I doubt, I yesterday put out
a 2.4.17 low-latency patch which has a worst-case latency which is
two orders of magnitude less that the preemptive kernel's.  The
lock-break patch will improve the preempt patch's worst case.

This tool needs a bit of maintenance work, but it can measure and identify
the source of worst-case interrupt latencies quite successfully.
