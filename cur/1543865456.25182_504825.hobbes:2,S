The patch looks ok.
However, due to certain peculiarities with memorystick and xd I have to emulate a scatter-gather
in software. Considering that this particular aspect of implementation is the same for all card
types on this TI chip, it can be shared by tifm_sd driver as well. In this case highmem won't be
needed to be avoided and kmap_atomic will come back (may be).
And, by the way, to what extent pagefault_enable/pagefault_disable calls are needed? They are
present in k(u)map_atomic even for non-highmem pages/architectures.
