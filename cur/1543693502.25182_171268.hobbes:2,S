I don't buy this. Without correct udelay()'s, how is code like this..
        for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                dump_udelay(1);
                if (OK_STAT((stat = hwif->INB(IDE_STATUS_REG)), good, bad))
                        return 0;
        } 
expected to work ? It won't wait for 10usec at all, but be over almost instantly.
Ramming commands at the drive before its status has settled doesn't strike
me as a particularly safe thing to do.
