When I wrote that code in the mid-1990s, the number one causes of drives
getting confused (and needing to be reset again), were improper DMA timings,
cablings, and buggy DMA firmware.
So at the time, since DMA was a newish feature for IDE, we figured that
turning it off after reset was a Good Thing(tm).
And it was.  A more modern implementation might try being more clever about
such stuff, and Tejun is working on something like that for libata.
In the meanwhile, you could have a shell script just loop in the background,
turning DMA back on periodically.  If you care.
Cheers
