An Mini-ITX with 550MHz isn't that much faster (but very quiet).

That's my current guess too.

I won't have time this week, maybe next.  What concerns my is that
-test11 locks the machine hard after an hour or so (nmi-watchdog
doesn't say anything), but 2.4 seems to be stable.  Since I need a
stable machine next week I'll stay with 2.4 for now and come back
later.
