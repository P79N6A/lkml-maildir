Thanks.  You may find that none of it compiles, and you'll need to take the
four or five patches immediately after #X64_64-END (ie: fixes against the
x86_64 tree) and place them at the appropriate places immediately after the
x86_64-mm-<whatever>.patch which they fix.
Specifically, put fix-x86_64-mm-i386-pda-smp-processorid.patch immediately
after x86_64-mm-i386-pda-smp-processorid.patch and put
fix-x86_64-mm-spinlock-cleanup.patch immediately after
x86_64-mm-spinlock-cleanup.patch.

Nope, there's a huge amount of stuff in there.  And it's pretty much all in
mainline as of a couple of hours ago, so bisecting the tree which you have
there is increasingly valuable.
Thanks for persisting with this.
