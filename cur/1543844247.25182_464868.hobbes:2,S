It is very basic right now.

When a container gone over the limit then it is okay to penalize it.  I
agree that I'm not making an attempt to maintain the current working
set.  Any suggestions that I can incorporate to improve this algorithm
will be very appreciated.

I agree that with in a container I need to do add more smarts to (for
example) not do a linear search.  Simple additions like last task or
last mapping visited could be useful. And I definitely want to improve
on that.
Though it should not destroy the existing kernel reclaim.  Pages
belonging to over the limit container should be the first ones to either
get flushed out to FS or swapped if necessary.  (Means that is the cost
that you will have to pay if you, for example, want to container your
tar to 100MB memory foot print).
