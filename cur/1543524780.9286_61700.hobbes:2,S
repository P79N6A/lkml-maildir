Hi,
I am running 2.2.14 on a Dual Celeron 400 system, and I too have
experienced a small number of complete system freezes while using ppp. I
usually log into this system over X and the system completely hangs giving
no error message. Could this be the same problem? If so what is the best
way of getting the Oops text?
Thanks
James
