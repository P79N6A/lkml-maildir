Then as part of the patch device_shutdown should disappear.  It
is silly to have two functions that want to achieve the same
thing.  
Right now the device driver model is ugly and over complicated in
that case and it needs to be simplified so driver writers have
a chance of getting it correct. 
device_suspend(PMSG_FREEZE) feels more reusable than device_shutdown
so long term it feels right.
But a simple question is why can't you simply use the shutdown
method instead of extending the suspend method in the drivers.
