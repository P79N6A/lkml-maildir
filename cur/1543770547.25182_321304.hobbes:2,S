No one ever said anything about hard RT IO, or making any syscalls hard
RT.  AFAIK this has never even come up during the PREEMPT_RT
development.  We just want our userspace code to be scheduled as soon as
it's runnable.  For the purposes of this entire thread, it's safe to
assume that if the RT thread does make any syscalls, it knows exactly
what it is doing, as in the JACK write() example.
