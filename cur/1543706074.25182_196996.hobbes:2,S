No, I don't think so... look at this code:
#ifdef MODULE_X86_64
	exit(1);
#else
	_exit(1);
#endif
	for (;;);	/* To suppress warning. */
This is a snippet from driver.c.
Bah! I've simply removed the #ifdef...#endif code and it seems to work,
but I was really curious why VMware was using _exit() for i386 and
exit() for x86_64.
