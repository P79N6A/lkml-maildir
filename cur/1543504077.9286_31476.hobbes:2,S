I'm one of those old fashioned people who thinks that a deadlock 
with an upper bound is much better than one without.

But  SCHED_RR is a problem on its own, is it not?
setsched(SCHED_RR)
while(i < 100 ){ 
                    g = g+1;
                   /* oops, I forgot to increment i*/
                }
And inetd never runs again.
