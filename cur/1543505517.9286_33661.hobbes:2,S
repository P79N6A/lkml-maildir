the way i have fixed this is to strip out everything in the no_cached_page
branch of filemap_nopage except for the first few lines that implement the
cluster read.  just after the cluster read, use "goto retry_find;".
so do this:
no_cached_page:
	/*
	 * Try to read in an entire cluster at once.
	 */
...
	for (i = 1 << page_cluster; i > 0; --i, reada += PAGE_CACHE_SIZE)
		new_page = try_to_read_ahead(file, reada, new_page);
	goto retry_find;
page_not_uptodate:
...
