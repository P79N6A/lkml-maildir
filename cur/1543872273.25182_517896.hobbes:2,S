While that is indeed true, I think users will have a judgement (perhaps 
call it "first impression") that puts a certain set of NF rules into 
either of the two categories "this is fundamental/generic enough to 
warrant its own module" and "this does not". While
  -A INPUT -s 134.76.0.0/16 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT;
  -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT;
  -A INPUT -j REJECT;
is clearly something that only applies to one machine only, perhaps a
little subnet, or at best, the servers on the company network, it is not
"for everyone". xt_CHAOS on the other hand was meant - if you want so - as
a replacement for DROP/REJECT and the default policy, e.g.:
	# Block all evil, even if from inside the house.
		-A INPUT -m evil -j CHAOS;
	# Ignore stray packets not directed at us
		-A INPUT -d mybase -m this -j ACCEPT;
	# Management console
		-A INPUT -s yourbase -m that -j ACCEPT;
	# Chain policy (instead, or supplemental to, -P INPUT DROP)
		-A INPUT -j CHAOS;
(-m evil, -m this and -m that are placeholders and are not seriously
considered to get their own kernel module anytime.)
For me, this falls under generic-enough, but your (and other people's) mileage
migt vary.
Thank you for the comments,
Jan
