And now more importantly, here's a patch to gets everything right.  This
is vs 2.4.16 + kbuild-2.5-2.4.16-3 + kbuild-2.5-2.4.16-ppc-1 (after
making it apply correctly).  I'll be sending along a 2.4.18-pre1 patch
later on (but vs a different base tree for now).  This fixes 3 things:
1) Add -Wa,-m405 to CONFIG_4xx AFLAGS
2) Either include <asm-offsets.h> or "ppc_defs.h".
3) Only have <asm-ppc/processor.h> include <asm/ptrace.h> if we're
!__ASSEMBLY__, since we were getting a warning.  I mean to spend a bit
more time poking around and seeing what/when we should/shouldn't be
defining STACK_FRAME_OVERHEAD, but for now this should do it.
