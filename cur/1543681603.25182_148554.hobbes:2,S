Added the IDs (0066 in my case, one of three according to Nvidia 
sources) to pci_ids.h and to the drivers. Assuming that is all that is 
needed, here's what happened:
amd8111e.c:
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:04.0 to 64
eth1: AMD-8111e Driver Version: 3.0.3
eth1: [ Rev 0 ] PCI 10/100BaseT Ethernet 00:00:00:00:00:00
Loaded fine, but note the incorrect MAC address.
pcnet32.c (with debug=7):
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:04.0 to 64
pcnet32.c:v1.27b 01.10.2002 tsbogend@alpha.franken.de
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:04.0 to 64
pcnet32: io address range already allocated
pcnet32.c:v1.27b 01.10.2002 tsbogend@alpha.franken.de
kobject_register failed for pcnet32 (-17)

  [<c010930b>] syscall_call+0x7/0xb
Any other likely candidates? Is there any way to probe this?
Thanks,
Rahul
