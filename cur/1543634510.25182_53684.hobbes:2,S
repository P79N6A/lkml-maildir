I gave it a go on a 320 that I have here and it gets into start_kernel
somewhere, but I don't get any output on the serial console.  If you'd
like to get it into 2.5, maybe we should clean it up a little first
(as well as get it working)?
When I ported the last patch forward to 2.4.17, I noticed that there
were quite a few parts that could use some work.  Looking through the
patch, it seems like the head.S stuff could be done in a better way,
maybe a seperate head.S for machines that start in protected mode?
Then again, maybe the boot loader should just be changed?  The
interrupt handler code also needs to be fixed up.
I haven't looked at the patch to seperate out i386 subarches yet, but
maybe that would be a good first step to abstracting away some of the
visws setup code?
