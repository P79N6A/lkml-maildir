As a side-note : I'd like to have my results confirmed by others. I just
found out that my 2 Seagate drives are in the "defect" list
(ST3500320AS) that exhibits the behavior to stop for about 30s when doing
"video streaming".
(
http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&taxonomyName=storage&articleId=9126280&taxonomyId=19&intsrc=kc_top
)
(
http://seagate.custkb.com/seagate/crm/selfservice/search.jsp?DocId=207931
)
Therefore, I would not take any decision based on such known bad
firmware. But the last results we've got are definitely interesting.
I'll upgrade my firmware as soon as Segate puts it back online so I can
re-run more tests.
