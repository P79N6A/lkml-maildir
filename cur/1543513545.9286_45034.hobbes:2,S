No Linus you don't need any *help* with drivers you really just need
to *delegate* the whole thing. The only thing you should maybe check
even in a 1MB diff from Donald for example is whatever it's leaving:
diff -urN linux/drivers/net
Even if the 1MB does cause intermittent problems.
But if you continue to act like a last ultimative instance for
*everything* then don't wonder that some people start to get
distracted...

But Alan's patches are usually involved in the "kernel" of the "kernel".
Or maybe more precisely: the generic parts of it. Drivers are a much
much
different matter. 
Don't wonder a firm self assured and competent person doesn't feel 
oblidget for the slavish work of the splitting (which is indeed 
plenty of), where it's really not neccesary at all for any technical
reason other then maybe someones need for total controll.
I remember the discussion about the tulip where you where arguing
over and over again in fact against the competence of Donald. Why didn't
you 
just let the updated version go in? Even with obvious bug's you did know
about!
And then let Donald just see himself?  Was it too difficult to 
prepare for diff -R in case of a total disaster and just forwarding 
all the bug reports to him in
the time between or what? No wonder he doesn't like to expose
himself to this very often. Some goes for the arguments in the
discussion against Mark Lord.
Those are the real reaons for the problems with the isdn, ftape,
bttv, and many in fact separately maintained driver groups.

Hell then what's the MAINTAINER's file supposed to be?
