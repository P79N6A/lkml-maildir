I've stayed out of this, but that sounds like a perfect solution to move 
the choice back to the user. However, installers still need to be aware 
of it at initial Linux install, and give the user some rational options:
   - ignore it
   - leave alone but visible
   - blow it away and use the whole drive
It feels as if that's where the future disposition needs to be made. I 
do like treating the HPA as a separate drive though.
