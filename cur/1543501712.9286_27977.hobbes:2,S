I encountered the following problem on this system:
Linux zeus 2.2.10 #5 Sun Jul 4 20:32:31 EDT 1999 i686 unknown
Kernel modules         2.1.121
Gnu C                  2.7.2.3
Binutils               2.9.1
Linux C Library        2.0.7
Dynamic linker         ldd: version 1.9.9
Linux C++ Library      2.8.0
Procps                 .
Mount                  2.9s

Kbd                    0.94
Sh-utils               1.16

its a P-II 333 with 128M of ram.
When compiled with Policy Routing Off
and Socket Filter Off
I could one of the machine's interfaces (it acts as a router) and after
the strobe finished (either Ctrl-C aborted or finish normally) the
device would shut down.
completely dead.
no interaction.
I got a no route to host  on a traceroute from the machine outside (via
the dead nic)
once policy routing was on and socket filters on then the strobe
stopped.
I have no greater explantion.
The only weird things on this machine are:
1. ip masq'd subnet - I discounted this b/c I disabled the masqing and
the problem still occured
2. I'm using ipac for ip accounting. I also disabled this and the
problem remained.
3. This machine has 10 NICS (TULIP)
I'm doing tests on some non-production machines to see if I can repeat
the incident.
I hope I'm reporting this to the right places.
Thanks
