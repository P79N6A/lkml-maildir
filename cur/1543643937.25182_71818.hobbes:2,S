The old way is broken, it sets the bound-device to 0 when sending
the syn-ack.  I am not sure exactly how this worked before, or
if it even worked at all.  I changed it to use the bound_dev_if of the
parent socket, which I believe is more correct.

It also failed due to the hashing issue, but with the current code,
packets to self from self will be dropped before reaching the IP
code, so that is not really a bug in the current code.
