Subject: 2.5.34 randomly freezes under X (seems input related)

Greetz,
On 2.5.34, moving the mouse around (just moving, not clicking) under 
an (almost) idle X "almost" reliably freezes my machine if I just do 
it long enough. I write "almost" because:
 1) It happened on 14 out of 15 sessions, sometimes immediately
    after logging in. I gave up on the one exception after trying
    for more than 5 minutes.
 2) It might be related to whether there is some background activity. 
    I have a shell script that forks a lot of stuff in quick succession 
    and it seems that a lockup is guaranteed if I move my mouse while 
    that script is running. The script is not a requirement, though.
Sadly, only the reset button helps and of course nothing useful shows 
up in the logs. :-( I tried very hard to reproduce it on a virtual 
console, but failed no matter how hard I stressed the box. So X "must" 
be part of the problem somehow.
This is 2.5.34 on a dual Pentium, gcc 2.95, no preempt, AT keyboard 
& serial mouse. I never got 2.5.32 and 2.5.33 to compile/boot, so the 
problem may not be all that new. 2.5.31 works OK (not fine, but OK).
Any ideas? It looks a bit like some input layer problem to me.
Feel free to ask for more configuration details if you're interested.

PS: Thanks for the working floppies!
