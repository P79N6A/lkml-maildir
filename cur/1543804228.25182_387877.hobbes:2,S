Yes, the syscall numbers are quite different, especially because x86 has
all syscalls, even the obsolete ones.
But what I mean is that the __NR_ia32_* macros in
asm-x86-64/ia32_unistd.h aren't used anywhere in the kernel.  And in
userland the asm-x86/unistd.h file is used when compiling x86 apps.  At
least this is how the kernel headers for userlevel use should be set up.
