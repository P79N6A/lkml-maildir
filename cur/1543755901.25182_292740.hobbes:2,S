Hello,
I am sending this report because this has been an
off-again, on-again problem in the 2.6 kernel series.
Everything was fine when the snd-intel8x0 had built-in
gameport support from 2.6.5(??) to 2.6.9. I just
simply had to add a file to /etc/modprobe.d containing
the following line
options snd-intel8x0 joystick=1
And everything worked fine. Now I recently installed
2.6.10 in Debian and kept getting the same error as
has been reported by others ( see ). The patch
attached to that bug report works against 2.6.10 and
fixes the problem ( at least it did for me ).
I would like to see this problem fixed and I'm willing
to help in any way I can. Attached to this message is
the patch I mentioned above.
Thanks!
