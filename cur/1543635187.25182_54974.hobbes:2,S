Complex, may not be reliable, and the question is "are you now or will you
ever run code in or for module XXX" because there may be pointers for
threads, interrupt handlers, etc. Gets ugly doing it from the back.
I think you have to do it with the use count, and there may well be
modules you can't remove safely. But to add re-init code to modules,
define new ioctls to call it, etc, etc, doesn't seem satisfactory. I think
we really need to bump the use counter more carefully, to really know when
a module is in use, and when we can clear it out.
The smp case looks doable, the preempt case may be harder. I really like
the idea of simply queueing a remove and then doing it when the use count
drops to zero. But we have have to provide a "don't use" to keep new
things out. That's hard.
