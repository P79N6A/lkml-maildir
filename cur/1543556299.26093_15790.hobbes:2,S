I have 2.4.0  test 10 and test 11 installed on a multiprocessor (Intel)
machine.  I have tried both test versions of the kernel.  I configured
the kernel for single
and multi processor.  When I boot single processor, iptables will run
fine.  When I boot the machine with the multiprocessor kernel and run
iptables, the kernel dumps several pages of hex and the final two lines
of output are:
Killing interrupt handler
scheduling in interrupt
The kernel logs nothing and you must reset the machine to bring it back
up.  I believe this is a kernel issue rather than an iptables
issue.
Does anyone have experience with iptables on a multiprocessor machine?
