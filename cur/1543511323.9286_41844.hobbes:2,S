I had a pair of custom 80 conductor udma66 cables custom made for my udma33
use.  I bought one 24" long, and another that was 28".  Both worked fine in
the 2.2.26 era, but were generating a lot of CRC errors with 2.2.10.  I had
to replace both of them with 18" cables to get the machine to stay alive...
though I did run this box with the longer udma66 for months with 2.2.6
without significant issue.  So I wouldn't suggest trying to use one for a
quick extension.
In general, this has been my experience...  That lately the code is very
sensitive to the ide cable I am using... in my box with 8 ide interfaces.  I
believe I've replaced all of my cables at least once ;( ... sometimes more
than once... trying to completely get rid of CRC errors.  I wonder if with
so many ide cables in the box I am getting crostalk between them?  Almost
all of them run essentially parallel to each other.
