I'm refering to the complexity of the behavior. Turning interrupts to
threads and spinlocks to mutexes makes vanilla Linux's behavior much
more complicated than it already is. But before a bunch of mouth-foaming
rugby players tackle me to the ground, please keep in mind that this is
my appreciation of things. Others have claimed that they are perfectly
fine with this ...

No challenge needed, I'm not refering to codebase. No to mention that I'm
not even going to get near claiming knowing the kernel's guts anywhere
as much as you do :)
Here's running the risk of comparing apples to oranges:
$ ll adeos-linux-2.6.11-i386-r10c3.patch realtime-preempt-2.6.12-rc4-V0.7.47-07

Here's from a previous posting back in october:

Clearly I recognize the work you have accomplished, and you are correct
in stating that the approach is nonexclusive. If the patch does indeed
make it into the kernel, then so be it. It's worth considering though
that there are other methods which can provide hard-rt without increasing
the kernel's complexity even when enabled; the most basic of which would
be turning the interrupt-handling/disable to function pointers. At the
next level, you could have something like the interrupt pipeline from
adeos on top (possibly as a loadable module), and at a third level you
could have something like RTAI/fusion (as additional loadable modules) ...
