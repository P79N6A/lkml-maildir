That all needs to be done by someone initially yes. But then tracking what happens
afterwards is something that can be distributed. A difficult bug can take a long
time to resolve and generate a lot of messages; you don't want to require
the initial sorter to handle all that too.
It's much more scalable to let the developers update the state themselves
then once they handle the bug.
