At least part of this patch can be included into the patch series that
Mingming has posted to allow larger block sizes on architectures that
support it.  This doesn't need a separate COMPAT flag itself, since
older kernels will already refuse to mount a filesystem with large blocks.

We may as well just change EXT3_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE to be 65536, because no other
code uses this value.  It is already 65536 in the e2fsprogs.

I'm not sure why you changed the formatting of this message to now be longer
than 80 columns.
