When distributing your module (with the license string fixed)
you may also distribute a kernel patch that disables the console message.
Better: you could change the logging level so the user only gets messages
in syslog and not on the console.  A customer clueless enough to be confused
by the tainting message probably don't need those other console messages either.
Users with enough clue to want these messages may then turn them on again.
