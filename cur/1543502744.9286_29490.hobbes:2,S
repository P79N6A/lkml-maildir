Lou,
  That is a subset of hinting, perhaps the most important subset.  Here are
some of the seminal papers on the subject:
    TIP - Transparent Informed Prefetching and Cashing
          
http://www.pdl.cs.cmu.edu/TIP/TIP.html
    Exposing IO Concurrency with Informed Prefetching
http://www.pdl.cs.cmu.edu/Publications/HTML-Papers/PDIS94/final.fm.html
TIP is a manual technique, that is, it is a set of system calls that one
sprinkles throughout one's program to initial readahead.  Included, of
course, is a system call that says `this file is going to be read
sequentially'.  The hinting techique others have been discussing in this
mailing list is, I believe, a method of automatically inserting TIP calls
into existing binaries.  The major paper on that subject is:
    Automatic I/O Hint Generation thruough Speculative Execution
