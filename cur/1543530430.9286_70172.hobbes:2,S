Hello,
I forgot to mention the most important thing : the process that opened the
socket
does no longer exist, but the socket is still there.
Scenario :
The client connects over dialup to an ISP and then connects to our server
through
secure pop to get his e-mail. The secure pop is handled by sslwrap and
forwarded
locally to pop3.
tcp       37      0 mail.scssoft.com:4301   mail.scssoft.com:pop-3
CLOSE_WAIT
tcp        0      0 mail.scssoft.com:spop3  datelc-164.vol.cz:1036
ESTABLISHED
Theese two connections remained, however, no process is associated with
them.
sslwrap is gone and ipop3d either. I am using 2.2.15pre14 on i586.
Is this normal ? When process dies, the kernel should close all associated
sockets,
right ?
Best,
Petr
