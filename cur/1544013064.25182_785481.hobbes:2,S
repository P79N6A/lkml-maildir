Subject: [patch 2.6.28] mmc: warn about voltage mismatches
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: David Brownell <dbrownell@users.sourceforge.net>
Get rid of a silent failure mode when the MMC/SD host doesn't
support the voltages needed to operate a given card, by
adding a warning.  A 3.3V host and a 3.0V card, for example,
no longer need to mysteriously just not work at all.
This isn't the best diagnostic; ideally it would also tell
what voltage the card and host support (and not just by
dumping the bitmasks).
