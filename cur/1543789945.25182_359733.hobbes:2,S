They are in process of rewriting the driver (they wrote this to me on Sep 16):
<cite>
We have a driver in beta for 2.6 kernels. Eventually we do plan to update the
main kernel with our changes, but after the driver is more stable and we have
more time to work on it.
Here is a link to the beta if you are interested
ftp://ftp.comtrol.com/contribs/Drivers/RPort/Linux/3.02
%20Beta%202.4-2.6/rocketport-linux-3.02.tgz
</cite>
The link is the same, so there is no new version, so I don't know the state of
the rewriting now, we'll see...
regards,
