AFAIK yes:
NEWS:
New in 0.5 - 1998-08-20, Erich Boleyn:
 * GRUB now shuts off the floppy before transferring control to any
   other programs/modules/loaders.  (chain-loading doesn't matter here,
   just loading 32-bit modules/kernels)
stage2/asm.S:
/*
 * stop_floppy()
 *
 * Stops the floppy drive from spinning, so that other software is
 * jumped to with a known state.
 */
ENTRY(stop_floppy)
       movw    $0x3F2, %dx
       xorb    %al, %al
       outb    %al, %dx
