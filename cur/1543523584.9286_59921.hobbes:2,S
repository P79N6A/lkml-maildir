Hmm.  I'm surprised.  Linux 2.3.x only compiles in ELF, and ELF permits
big alignments.  Oddness.

On 486s it's a good idea because they have a cache.  cf. Recent patch
from IBM which speeds up the scheduler simply be moving some memory
accesses to within a cache line.  A smaller alignment value might be
more suitable for a 486 though.  Some nominal 386s have a cache too.
