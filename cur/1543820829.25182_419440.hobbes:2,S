While this is example of labeling issues with SELinux is correct for a
standard targeted policy, it does not represent an intrinsic problem
with the SELinux mechanism. A policy that has the appropriate
specialized domains for reading /etc/shadow and corresponding
type_transition rules can prevent this mislabeling. The solution may not
be very satisfying because of the changes it makes to how systems are
typically administered, but at least it does exist within the SELinux
model. The same cannot be said of the problems introduced by path-based
mechanisms.
