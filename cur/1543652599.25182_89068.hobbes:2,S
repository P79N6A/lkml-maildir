You can simply mount /dev/ataraid/d?p? on /mnt and start  the slackware
installation setup script skipping the selection of the target, the swap
and the lilo configuration; after istallation is completed, you can edit
/etc/fstab and /etc/lilo.conf as you whish.

I compiled the kernel with PDC202XX driver, with ataraid and with FastTrak
ataraid driver.

I tryed to compile pdc202xx and not ataraid to try to use software raid.
Is this the answer you were lookig for?
In all the cases my pdc20276 hangs after about half a gigabyte written
into any disk.
