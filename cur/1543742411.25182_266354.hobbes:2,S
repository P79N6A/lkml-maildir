Subject: [BUG][2.6.8.1] serial driver hangs SMP kernel, but not the UP kernel
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I am new to the list, hope this is ok..
I've read about several problems others are having with the new 2.6 serial driver in the list, and tried to see if their solutions solved my issue also, but unfortunately none that I have tried yet have helped.
We're migrating our applications for the Dell Remote Access Controller (DRAC) to run on a 2.6 kernel from a 2.4 kernel. Communication between the apps and the DRAC happen over a ppp link which is established via a service startup script; the script uses setserial to prepare an unused tty (based on the assigned hardware information, obtained via lspci), and the script then calls pppd to finish/establish the link.
Everything works fine with the UP kernel -- Although, there is a message in syslog regarding a spinlock (issued at approximately the same point in time where the SMP kernel hangs):

With the SMP kernel, it hangs very soon after starting pppd.
I enabled DEBUG in the serial driver and captured the syslog when the problem happens, but this is not detailed enough for me to finger the exact problem:

The system hangs right there; must press and hold power to get the system to shut down.
Any suggestions to narrow down the cause?  Please cc my email as I do not subscribe to this list.
