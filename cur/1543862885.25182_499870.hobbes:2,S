Hi,
I have a question, while a general protection occured, do_general_protection()
should be called, to other faults, it always set siginfo struct, but at this  
function, it just send a SIGSEGV by force_sig() call but not create a siginfo
struct, at send_signal(), it check the siginfo's value and create the siginfo,
then set siginfo->si_code to SI_KERNEL, but to SIGSEGV signal, the si_code 
should be SEGV_MAPERR or SEGV_ACCERR, to application, it will receive a 
siginfo which si_code is SI_KERNEL, so, why not check the details of fault, 
and set the corresponding value?
Would you pls give me any advices?
Thanks,
Joe
