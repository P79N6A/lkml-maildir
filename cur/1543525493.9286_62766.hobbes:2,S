Same motherboard here - The current release of lm-sensors DOES support the
Asus chip, although not perfectly. See 
http://www2.www2.lm-sensors.nu/~lm78/
Voltages + Motherboard temperature are OK; displayed fan rpm seems to be
1/3 too high, CPU temperature also is seems off by some weird factor
(displayed value too low); if you fiddle a bit with the allowed value
ranges you still get decent warning if something goes wrong.
Bye, Martin
