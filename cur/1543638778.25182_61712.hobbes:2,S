The quick answer: so we don't miss waking someone up.  But, seriously,
the semaphore code is very subtle.
This semaphore implementation allows more than one process to be in the
critical section at a time (a.k.a. a counting semaphore).  In order to
support those semantics, more than one wakeup may occur before a process
is pulled off the wake_q and changed to running.  Because the process that
is waiting to run (in the __down() code) is responsible for pulling itself 
off the wait_q, if the 2 __up()s happen before the __down() can finish,
the 2 __up()s will wakeup the same process twice.  So, the __down() code
needs to protect agaist this.
