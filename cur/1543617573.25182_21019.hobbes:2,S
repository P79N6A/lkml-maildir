Sure..No problem..Currently running:
* Mozilla mail
* mozilla browser
* 7-8 xterms
* xmms playing loud music :-)
* vmware running my windows XP pro,256 megs of mem reserved for the 
virtual machine..inside XP two instances of Internet explorer,ICQ,MS 
Access,MS Excel
* vncviewer to a windows box
I think that's about it ;-)
And I did the echo 500 > /proc/sys/vm/vm_mapped_ratio with the aa patch..
At first the rrmap was just as good,but apparently it decided to swap 
out my vmware so all of a sudden it seemed to be running off the 
harddrive only and just changing desktops in X took ages...swap was up 
to 130 MB before I decided to reboot using the aa patch.
Now swap is at 300k and seems stable so far..It will increase I'm sure 
(did the last time) but not as much as the rrmap..Still I'd like to do 
without swap altogether but I can't as vmware won't run without it :-(
best regards
Christian
