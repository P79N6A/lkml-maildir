Most CPUs implement memory breakpoints of some sort, although they're 
usually limited to specific address instead of ranges.  See gdb's 
watch/awatch/rwatch commands.

Use mprotect() and do it in userspace by catching SIGSEGV.  Doing it for 
the kernel is non-trivial and will hit upon arch specific issues like 
double fault handlers.  Given that the same sort of debugging can be done 
in userspace with UML and gdb, there isn't terribly much incentive to do 
the work to make something like this happen.
