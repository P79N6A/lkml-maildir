Randomly seeking around a 40G disk isn't going to give the caching much
to work with (that was on a 256Mbyte machine).  Also, I tried it with
raw devices, but it made no difference to the measurements.

Not really.  I wanted results which at least confirm the simple model of
how the disk works.  When I did deterministic seeks, it was something
like:
	for(n = 0; n < disksize/2; n += about_a_cylinder) {
		seek(n);
		read();
		seek(disksize-n);
		read();
	}
I suspect that the drive was partitioning its cache and using lots of
readahead to satisfy the reads at either end of the seek.  I was trying
to work around that by making the n increment large enough, but it
didn't seem to work.  Maybe the drive was being extra special clever, or
maybe I miscalculated the cylinder size.  Or maybe I just happened to be
hitting a rotational sweet-spot.
For this kind of test, it would be interesting to know what differences
there are between read and write.  In principle the drive could start
writing a track anywhere it wants so long as it has enough to write the
whole thing.  That would automatically make it get the track-track skew
right...
