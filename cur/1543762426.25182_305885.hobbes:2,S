Looks good performance wise.  Took a quick micro benchmark measurement on
a 16-node numa box (32-way). Results are pretty nice (to the expectation).
Time to execute del_timer_sync, averaged over 10,000 call:
Vanilla 2.6.11	19,313 ns
2.6.12-rc1-mm1	    81 ns
del_singleshot_timer_sync 74ns
Took another measurement on a 4-way smp box:
Vanilla 2.6.11	648 ns
2.6.12-rc1-mm1	 55 ns
del_singleshot	 41 ns
And Andrew always asks what are the impact on real-world bench, we did
not see performance regression on db transaction processing benchmark
with these set of timer patches versus using del_singleshot_timer_sync.
(del_singleshot_timer_sync is slightly faster, though 14 ns difference
falls well into noise range)
Note: I've only stress tested deleting an un-expired timer.
