Well, another year has passed, and somehow the duct tape that keeps our 
hard drives together has remained intact.  After a nice and refreshing 
holiday, I have a bunch of patches pending, that will probably take a 
week or two to sort through.
For 2.6.16, my main goals are getting irq-pio upstream and supporting 
iomap -- which will kill all those annoying warnings finally.  And 
probably some EH work from Tejun will go in too.  The suspend/resume 
stuff is shaping up nicely, and device hotplug work suddenly reappeared. 
  Fun for all.
Port multiplier and NCQ (queueing) support are the two other big to-do 
items on the list.
I updated the hardware status report at
	
http://linux.yyz.us/sata/
and will update the software status report in a week or two.
Everybody wants to play in the same sandbox, so please be patient as we 
sort it all out.
Cheers and happy new year,
	Jeff
