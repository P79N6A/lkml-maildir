Dear,
Thank you for your reply. However ...
The supposed action of my program depended on the Round Robin
scheduling on 1 CPU. The program produced two processes and they would
be executed alternately, because it yielded each other on 1 CPU.  The
main problem is one process monopolied a CPU even if it executed
sched_yield().
On SMP two processes were executed at the same time and caused race
condition. The action would not be forecasted.
