this sounds similar to a problem I am attempting to duplicate in my lab
(or will be when I get back into the office on monday anyway :-)
a box that over time starts to have more and more CPU eaten up by the
system while processing the same load, lots of memory available (>100MB
free) and no swap allocated (at least as reported by top)
in my case the machine would be writing lots of log entries (via syslog)
as well as forking frequently (dozens of times/sec)
the loadave would start at <1 for a freshly booted box but would climb to
~12-14 around the time it collapsed, rebooting the box (under the same
load) would clear things up.
no swapping was involved on my machine, but is it possible that similar
effects could happen with writes/reads to unix sockets or syslog writing
to the disk? (~200MB of logs per min, logs rotated every hour)
