   We have to at least insert a "set_fs(get_fs())", but IMO a separate
   interface would be better. Any opinions?
Right, it is portable if set_fs(KERNEL_DS) is done around it.
This is how most arch syscall ABI translation layers work btw.
Because this way basically must work, I would prefer it gets fixed
like this instead of creating a new interface.
