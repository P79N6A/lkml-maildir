But it's not correct - the test prohibits suspending devices even if 
it would be safe to do so.

No. The proposed interface is currently implemented by three network 
drivers out of over seventy. Once the rest (or even the majority of the 
rest) are converted to support that, I'd have no objections to the 
removal being scheduled.
