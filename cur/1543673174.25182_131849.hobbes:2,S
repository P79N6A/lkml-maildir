Exactly.  I don't want to explicitly poll each process being monitored to see if 
it is still alive.  That solution doesn't scale well--what happens when you are 
monitoring 5000 processes and you want to make sure that you catch them within a 
certain amount of time?  You end up spending a lot of cpu time doing the monitoring.

Its cheaper and faster.  It only costs a single call for each process, and then 
you get notified immediately when it dies.
