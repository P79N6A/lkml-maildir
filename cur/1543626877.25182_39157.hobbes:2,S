Just a public word of thanks to Ben for improving the driver. I've got
7 shiny new Addtron cards (aka "El Cheapo":-) and with 2.4.19-pre6 I'm
getting TCP bandwidths of 69 MB/s (PIII 450 SMP to Athalon 500 UP) and
52 MB/s (Athalon 500 UP to PIII 450 SMP). CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=n. This is
with two 16 m runs of Category 5 cable (still waiting for the Cat 6).
MTU=1500.
Only half of the theoretical bandwidth, but, hey, it's heaps better
than 100 Mb/s. Hopefully the remaining 50% will be reclaimed after
more hackery (and/or NAPI). Being on a mixed 10/100/1000 Mb/s network
means that I'm stuck with MTU=1500.
