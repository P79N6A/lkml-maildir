Subject: [PATCH] ppp_generic.c: last_channel_index
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I found that after I repeatedly opened and closed PPP connections, I would
get an Oops.  PPP daemon would try to allocate strange PPP interface numbers
(ppp12, for example) and other sanity checks would fail (kind != INTERFACE
|| CHANNEL)
The last_channel_index wasn't being cleaned up when the channel was closed,
leading to these problems the next time a PPP channel was opened.  This
patch fixes the problem for me.
using ppp-2.4.0, patch against: linux-2.4.6
Regards,
Brian
