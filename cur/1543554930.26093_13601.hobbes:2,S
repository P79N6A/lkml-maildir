This is an artifact from the ISA 10-bit IO bus.  Many ISA cards do not
decode all 16 address bits so you get aliases of the 0x100-0x3ff region
throughout IO space.  PCI cards should only use the first 256 ports of
any 1k block to avoid aliases unless they claim the base alias.  For
example, all the xxe8 addresses for the S3 are aliases of 0x02e8 to an
ISA card.  Video cards are an exception to the general rule because they
have to support all the legacy VGA crap.

The current code already tries to avoid the ISA alias areas:
/*
 * We need to avoid collisions with `mirrored' VGA ports
 * and other strange ISA hardware, so we always want the
 * addresses to be allocated in the 0x000-0x0ff region
 * modulo 0x400.
 *
 * Why? Because some silly external IO cards only decode
 * the low 10 bits of the IO address. The 0x00-0xff region
 * is reserved for motherboard devices that decode all 16
 * bits, so it's ok to allocate at, say, 0x2800-0x28ff,
 * but we want to try to avoid allocating at 0x2900-0x2bff
 * which might have be mirrored at 0x0100-0x03ff..
