Hello,
Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.c currently says:
If nr_blocks=0 (or size=0), blocks will not be limited in that instance;
if nr_inodes=0, inodes will not be limited.
However, mounting a tmpfs with "mount -t tmpfs -o size=0 tmpfs 
/root/tmpfs" results in a tmpfs where only zero-sized files can live. So 
either this behaviour should be fixed to be in accordance with the 
documentation, or the documentation should reflect the current behaviour.
