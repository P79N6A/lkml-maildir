Documentation/CodingStyle says:
The limit on the length of lines is 80 columns and this is a hard limit.
Statements longer than 80 columns will be broken into sensible chunks.
Descendants are always substantially shorter than the parent and are placed
substantially to the right. The same applies to function headers with a long
argument list. Long strings are as well broken into shorter strings.
