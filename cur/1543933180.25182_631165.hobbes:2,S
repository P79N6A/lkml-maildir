Andrew,
Here are the mmap read-around related patches initiated by Linus.
They are for linux-2.6.24-rc5-mm1. They're mainly about code cleanups.
The only major new feature - auto detection and early readahead for mmap
sequential reads - shows about 2% speedup on single stream case, and should
perform much better in multiple streams case.
This take: simplified patch 2, from
