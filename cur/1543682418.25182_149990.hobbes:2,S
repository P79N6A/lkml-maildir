Thanks for sending the 2.6 patch, due to work pressure, I have had very little
time to do these things recently.  I am still, however, actively developing
squashfs (a 1.3 with some improvements will be released soon), and I'd prefer
to do code fixes myself.

I tend to allocate (small) buffers on the stack, when their size does not
seem to warrant either: a globally kmalloced buffer and consequent locking,
or a locally kmalloced buffer kfreed on exit from the function, which seems
wasteful. However, if 1K is the perceived wisdom on stack limits, then I will
alter the code.
