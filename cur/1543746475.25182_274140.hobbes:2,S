I think the it would be much nicer to habe the console code in 
userspace, ruby is only a patch, not in the mainline kernel, and AFAIK 
not even in any experimental (-mm/-ac/-etc) tree.
There are many aproaches how to solve the problem of having more than 
one ative VT, and the userspace console seems to be the nicest one.
I know that Jon Smirl wrote an email some time ago, here it is: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/2/111,
 look at point 15. I like the idea and 
I've written him several times, but he didn't answer :(
Anyone knows what's happened with him?
I know he's involved in the DRM development, so I CC to the dri-devel list.
I'd really like to help with this, as I like and share his ideas.
Is anyone already working on this? I mean pulling the console code out 
of the kernel into the userspace.
