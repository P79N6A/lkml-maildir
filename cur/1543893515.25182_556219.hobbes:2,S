Good question. I should have documented it in the patch ;)
The short answer:
there can be multiple read streams per fd, i.e.  interleaved reads.
file_ra_state can not easily track all of the streams. Solaris zfs
does it by managing a list in struct dnode. While PG_readahead plus
the context based readahead(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/15/54
) makes
another solution. The two solutions are comparable in complexity.
The context based readahead is a bit more feature rich: it is sensible
to memory pressure, and supports an unlimited number of streams. Note
that random reads can be regarded as a huge number of one-shot streams,
which can interfere with zfs's list-based readahead states badly.
