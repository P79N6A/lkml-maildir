For almost all _new_ drivers, this is the case.  They are well supported
and build on all platforms.
Yes, there are plenty of old drivers that are marked BROKEN (look at the
scsi tree for some examples there), and some that still use cli (which
the kernel janitors keep trying to fix up but the very fact that no one
has the hardware to test their changes keeps that effort from going
anywhere.)  But that is not the case for new stuff, nor is it the case
for things I am offing here.

Yeah, sometimes you really need someone who has the device in a machine
that still boots :)
