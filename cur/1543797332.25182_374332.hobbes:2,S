Subject: problem with gate_vma flags?

When viewing /proc/<pid>/maps on i386, the final page shows up as :
ffffe000-fffff000 ---p 00000000 00:00 0
If I'm reading the code correctly, this is the address range controlled 
by gate_vma.
The permissions are marked as nothing because when this vma is created 
"vm_flags" is set to 0.  However, shouldn't it be at least VM_READ and 
possibly also VM_EXEC?
