Yeah, frto should help if you're seeing unnecessary retransmission
timeouts caused by delay spikes. It won't do much good if you're also
losing packets, e.g., due to overflowing the modem buffers. From what I
gathered from your explanation, the cable link might also be bunching up
the incoming ACK packets into bursts, each of which causes the sending
TCP to inject a corresponding burst of new segments into the network. If
that's what is happening, rate capping is probably more effective. Even
if you set the rate cap a little high it should mitigate the effects of
the bursts.
