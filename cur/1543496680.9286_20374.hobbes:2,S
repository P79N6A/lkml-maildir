You can at least see my latest changes to my kernel-unlock code at:
	
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/andrea/kernel/2.3.3_andrea5.bz2
I am not going to spend more time in such code since is better to spend
time to do the proper finegrined locking. When the kernel lock will be
dropped in the critical places I'll kill such uaccess.h-unlock code (even
if the lock-drop is placed in a _not_ inlined slow path...).
BTW, as usual there are also the far faster mirrors of my ftp area:
	
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/andrea/
	(USA, Thanks to SuSE -> 
http://www.suse.com/,
 large bandwith)
