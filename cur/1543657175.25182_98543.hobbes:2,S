I didn't notice any way it would track, and return, DMA addresses.
It's much like a kmem_cache in that way.

In My Ideal World (tm) Linux would have some kind of memory allocator
that'd be configured to use __get_free_pages() or dma_alloc_coherent()
as appropriate.  Fast, efficient; caching pre-initted objects; etc.
I'm not sure how realistic that is.  So long as APIs keep getting written
so that drivers _must_ re-invent the "memory allocator" wheel, it's not.
But ... if the generic DMA API includes such stuff, it'd be easy to replace
a dumb implementation (have you seen pci_pool, or how usb_buffer_alloc
works? :) with something more intelligent than any driver could justify
writing for its own use.
