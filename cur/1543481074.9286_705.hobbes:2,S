Sorry misread the message, DM wouldn't help here, this sounds like an old
kernel version problem.  Try 2.0.36 or higher.  And Linux does work with
Disk Manager (I've used it myself several times); this program allows you to
boot large hard drives on machine's who's BIOS doesn't recognize its native
capacity.
