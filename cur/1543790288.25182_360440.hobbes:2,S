Hey Eugene,
Thanks for the bug report.  Here's the story on the Marvell SATA driver. 
  We have custom hardware here with integrated 6081 controllers and a 
uniprocessor board.  The driver was developed and tested solely on that 
platform and works very well for me.  However, I haven't had the time to 
try it on normal 6xxx or 5xxx HBA cards (like everyone else in the world 
is using) or on an SMP system.  It's been something I've been meaning to 
do for some time now.
Compounded with that, I've decided to leave my current position to 
pursue my career at another company (still doing Linux kernel 
development but in a different area).  Thus, I will be less focused on 
the driver and might not have access to HW and specifications.  I know 
there are others on this list who do have both of those necessary 
requirements for development so it's possible they can help pick up the 
slack.
In the meantime, try turning off SMP and seeing if that makes a 
difference.  There still might be a problem with the spinlocks and if so 
it should go away in uniprocessor mode.
Thanks for your interest,
BR
