Hmm? This maintains the _exact_ old semantics, ie we do exactly what it 
used to do before. The inline function doesn't save the value off 
anywhere, it's really just a nicer way to do a cast in _one_ place rather 
than all over the world. Also, it ends up resulting in just _one_ place 
that knows where to get the base address, instead of several places in 
pretty much every function in the whole driver ;-P

Yes. I didn't want to change actual behaviour in a driver that I can't 
even test, so I went for the semantically 100% equivalent cleanup patch 
instead that just changes the syntax and gets rid of the warnings.
But that's the other advantage of the ns_ioaddr() accessor function:  
somebody who does have the hw can now phase out "base_addr", and just
change that one one-liner function, and you can now get the base address
from anywhere you like ;)
