Trying 2.6.5-rc3 on a Centrino 1.30GHz notebook, 512MB DDR. 
Slackware sid userspace. Kernel built with most laptop features. Kernel 
2.6.5-rc1 and rc2 had no issues.
After boot things are fine for a while, then without any visible diagnostic
output, the machine gets very slow. Running top shows that events/0 is
consuming the CPU. (94%) and no way to stop process/.
Suggests for where to look or what to try? How do i stop the pid?
