Kernel parameter would be good so that those who dont have ISA can omit
allocations while those with bizarre ISA devices can reserve as much as
they need.
Eg "dmareserve=2m" to reserve 2mb or "dmareserve=5p" to reserve 5% of all
ram (up to the 16mb limit of course).
BTW some PCI devices have arbitrary limits on address registers as well so
on extremely large machines it is possible to still run out of DMA buffers
