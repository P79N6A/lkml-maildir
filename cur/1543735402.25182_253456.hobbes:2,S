I never claimed nproc is perfect. Solutions with comparable performance
and simplicity are conceivable, but none of them will work anything
like procfs.

Actually, that's just a by-product of the design. It is what you get when
you put all the fields back to back. The only addition I made kernel-side
to make this easy to exploit was the introduction of a NOP field.

Yup. The labels are not useful for the tools you maintain.

Sounds like what wli and I have discussed as differential updates a few
weeks ago. I agree that would be nice, for now the goal was to suggest
something that's cleaner and faster than procfs. Extensions are easy
to add later.

True if you consider a static set of fields that never changes. Problematic
otherwise, because as soon as you start grouping fields together, you need
an agreement between kernel and user-space on the contents of these groups.
With nproc, the kernel is free to group fields together for computation
(even the first release calculated all the fields that needed VMA walks
in one go).

Agreed, that would be useful. And it would be easy to integrate with
nproc. Just add a field to return the cookie and a selector based on
cookies rather than PIDs.

You lost me there.
