Can you please add some explanation to the kernel documentation, what
this parameter does and why it helps?
kernel-parameters.txt says only:
[...]
        allowdma0       [ISAPNP]
[...]
pnp.txt says:
[...]
also there are a series of kernel parameters:
allowdma0
pnp_reserve_irq=irq1[,irq2] ....
pnp_reserve_dma=dma1[,dma2] ....
pnp_reserve_io=io1,size1[,io2,size2] ....
pnp_reserve_mem=mem1,size1[,mem2,size2] ....
[...]
Even if I'd read the files, I'd never guess that I should try that
parameter.
