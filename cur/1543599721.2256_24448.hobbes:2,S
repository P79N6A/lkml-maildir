It will enter maintenance mode if fsck was unable to fix errors as a 
previous boot-up.  Boot with your RH71 cd, enter "linux rescue" at the 
"boot:" prompt, and your system will be mounted under /mnt/sysimage.  It 
may delay for a little while while coming up if it's re-running fsck. 
 After you have a prompt (navigate throught the text dialog boxes 
first), run fsck and you can fix the partition or inode errors.
