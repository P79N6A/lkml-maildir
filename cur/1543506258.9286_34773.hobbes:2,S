Even 99%.  Over 90% of the postings appear to belong to threads.

Excellent suggestion.  I'll even volunteer to be a moderator.  I think
that the latest round of nonsense makes it clear that SOME sort of
defensive measure will end up being necessary in the long run.  It is
just too easy for one jerk to annoy thousands of people with one nasty
trick, and even without this sort of SPAM-bombing we've been getting
plenty of random SPAM, which will only increase.  Moderating can't take
any longer than hitting "d" fifty extra times -- either a posting is
legit or it isn't.
