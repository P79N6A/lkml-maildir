I found the culprit. It's sched_yield again. When I straced gnomemeeting
even without load I saw a lot of sched_yields. So I googled around for
2.6 and sched_yield and found among others
http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/kernel/o1-openmp.php
 by David
Mosberger. I tried gnomemeeting with the romp hack at the end of the
article which changes all sched_yields to noops via library preloading.
The difference was _really_ impressive. No matter how many non-yield
loops and kernel compiles I ran gnomemeeting didn't even skip once.
So the questionable code in pwlib is probably:

Defining Yield to noop and building a new libpt solved the problem
permanently for me.
It seems that not all people have got problems with gnomemeeting and
2.6. Damien Sandras (the gnomemeeting maintainer) for example reported
that he hasn't got any problems with gnomemeeting on 2.6 while compiling
in parallel. So I guess it's depending on the frequency of sched_yields
one gets in gnomemeeting. Which is probably depending on the processor
speed, etc.
That just leaves the question what is the proper fix, to send it
upstream and to note the phenomenon down in a faq.
Thanks to all who helped me with debugging advice and if anybody needs
further information just ask.

What's the railroad to me ?
I never go to see
Where it ends.
It fills a few hollows,
And makes banks for the swallows, 
It sets the sand a-blowing,
And the blackberries a-growing.
