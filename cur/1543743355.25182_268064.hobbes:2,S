orinoco_lock() only ever returns either 0 or -EBUSY, so it's
essentially boolean.  There's no reason to expect it would ever return
anything else.  Using it in if statements directly removes a few lines
of code, removes the need for a few extra 'err' variables, and makes
things slightly neater in the case where just propagating the -EBUSY
up isn't the right thing to do.  It's no big deal, but we did make
this change in CVS for a reason.
