Well, there are not much PCI-Cards in this server and reseating them
didnt fix it.

Thanks for that, i was able to reboot the machine with that trick, but
i couldnt find anything bad in the messages file.
I made some further tests with the server:
Deactivating the raid, and formating the hd´s (hdc and hdd) with
reiser4, mounting them and sharing them via nfs and ftp worked great, no
freezes, no reboots, everything perfect, even the performance.
But as soon, as i activated the raid, the server freezed, or rebooted.
Maybe this problem is not a bug in a single component (eg: nfs or
reiser4), i think it is the combination of linux raid with reiser4, but
i dont know.
I will try to get the raid up and running with ext3 and/or jfs.
Then we know exactly, if it is the combination of raid and reiser4.
Kind regards
Florian Engelhardt
