There are some big ones in drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c.  I submitted a patch a
while back to get them removed, but it looks like they are still there in
2.3.48.
They seem like just a careless waste of space to me, especially for certain
embedded applications where the kernel (uncompressed) executes in-place
(XIP) from ROM.
