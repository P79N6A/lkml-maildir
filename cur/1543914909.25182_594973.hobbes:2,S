I made the explicit decision to dynamically allocate because
many systems have limits on how large the kernel image can
be and therefore the less we statically allocate huge tables
(constant size or not) the better.
Lockdep is the worst offender, for example, it's completely awful.  It
consumes 4MB of kernel BSS space when enabled on a 64-bit platform.
Patch not applied.
