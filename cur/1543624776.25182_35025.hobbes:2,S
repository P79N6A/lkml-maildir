Let me clarify my "pthreads are crap" statement.
I firmly believe that there is a place for clone & futex threaded
programs, which is not met by pthreads for cleanliness and performance
reasons, and that such programs will become increasingly important.
Therefore I refuse to penalise such progressive programs so we can
have standards compliance.  Hence my insistance on a clean, minimal,
useful interface.

The solution I was referring to before, using full semaphores, would
look like so:
struct pthread_cond_t
{
	int num_waiting;
	struct futex wait, ack;
};
#define PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER { 0, { 0 }, { 0 } }
int pthread_cond_signal(pthread_cond_t *cond)
{
	if (cond->num_waiters)
		return futex_up(&cond->futex, 1);
	return 0;
}
int pthread_cond_broadcast(pthread_cond_t *cond)
{
	unsigned int waiters = cond->num_waiting;
	if (waiters) {
		futex_up(&cond->futex, waiters);
		/* Wait for ack before returning. */
		futex_down(&cond->ack);
	}
	return 0;
}
int pthread_cond_wait(pthread_cond_t *cond, pthread_mutex_t *mutex)
{
	int ret;
	/* Increment first so broadcaster knows we are waiting. */
	atomic_inc(cond->num_waiting);
	futex_up(&mutex, 1);
	ret = futex_down(&cond);
	if (atomic_dec_and_test(cond->num_waiting))
		futex_up(&cond->ack);
	futex_down(&mutex->futex);
	return ret;
}
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
