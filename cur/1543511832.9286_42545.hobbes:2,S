Not smoking crack, but there are 127 device id's. This means up to 127
physically different devices can be connected to one device. However, a
device doesn't mean one function. USB devices have things called
interfaces which operate independately.
I have a keyboard with a mouse port on it (legacy ps/2 style mouse),
it's 1 USB device id, but 2 functions, and thusly 2 devices the way unix
traditionally see them.
You can theoretically have an unlimited amount of interfaces on one
device, but practically, about 15 (16 endpoints - 1 default).
Think of a High Density modem, with 8 (or up to 15) modems in one box,
kinda like a USR Total Control card or something similar. Definately
feasible.
That also doesn't take into account multiple busses.
