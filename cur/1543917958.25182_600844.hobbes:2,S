Ahh, ok. Then it actually makes sense. Although I'd prefer it if people 
planned on writing code like that more along the lines of
	error = PTR_ERR(inode);
	if (IS_ERR(inode)
		return ERR_PTR(error);
because let's face it, the compiler can turn this into nice code, and 
humans can read it much better even if it's got an "unnecessary" extra 
variable etc..
