I played about with this a long time ago at the beginning of
2.5, so was attempt to do this with the old build system which
didn't had a few awkward bits, and then I was distracted by userspace

What I did I put here (

 )
it might be of use - though as I recall correctly most of the 
code was taken from  patch(1). So it's nothing special.
