Hello,
I recently tried out dyntick 050610-1 against 2.6.12.3, works great, it 
actually makes a noticeable difference on my laptop's battery life. I don't 
have hard numbers, lets just say that instead of the usual ~3 hours i get out 
of it, i was ~4 before it started nagging, usual use pattern at work.
The only gripe I have with it that it stops S3 from working. If the patch is 
compiled in the kernel, it makes S3 suspend correctly, but resuming goes into 
a solid hang (nothing get's it back alive, have to keep the powerbutton for 
~5 secs to shutdown the system)
Anything I could test? The logs don't give anything useful..
Thanks,
Jan
