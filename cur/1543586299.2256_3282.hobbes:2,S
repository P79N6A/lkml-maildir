Subject: Kernel Summit info?

One of the reasons I read the kernel mailing list is that it's educational
and fascinating to see the discussion between the kernel developers.  
This weekend (including today) many of the well known Linux developers are
at the kernel summit meeting.
I'm sure that having a face to face meeting like that is a great way to get
a lot of work done quickly, and make some of the difficult decisions. I
don't begrudge the developers for having a meeting like that.  I don't even
mind that it's invitation only. That was probably the only efficient way to
organize it.
However...  for those of us who are curious, is there a web site somewhere
with information about the goings-on? What would be really nice is web cams,
or a RealAudio feed from the meetings.
Is anything like that available?  I'm really hoping that some of the people
present at least post summaries about what the topics of discussion were,
what options were looked at, and what decisions were made.  Are any
journalists there?
Thanks.
