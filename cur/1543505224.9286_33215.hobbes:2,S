Hi there,
Thanks for working on this.  However, it looks like you're still doing
magic stuff with U+E800-U+EFFF.  That's a quite unfortunate choice,
since this is the user/application reserved character area, and hence
represents real characters.
Note that under Linux, there are two ranges you can use that are
guaranteed to not match any real characters:
U+F000 to U+F7FF:
	This is the "straight-to-font" region for output; clearly it
	is meaningless for input; perhaps it could be used for raw
	scancodes or something like that, but there aren't any plans
	for doing so.
U+D800 to U+DFFF:
	This is the region reserved for UTF-16 surrogates.  Since
	UTF-16 doesn't apply to this context, they can be used under
	the "subject to higher protocol" provision (in this case, the
	higher protocol dictates that 0xd800 to 0xdfff aren't unicodes
	at all, but rather escape sequences to the keyboard driver.)
