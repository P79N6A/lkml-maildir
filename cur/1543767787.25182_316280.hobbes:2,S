It's worth a shot. Just for the record, I haven't had any such errors on my
machine.

So much for that thought.  The kernel config is solid (as expected).

I just had an idea.  Using the old PDC20269 IDE driver, try repeating
your test to trigger clock drift.  While the test is in progress, run
hdparm (no need for -i) on both drives.  I wonder if it's dropping out
of DMA mode temporarily for no apparent reason.
Thanks,
