If this is done, I think it's essential that a "high-level" API (one 
that supports message-based GPIO) is provided at the same time.  The 
"high-level" API should be able to address the GPIOs addressed by the 
low-level API.  What we do *not* want is a bunch of stuff using the 
low-level API when the high-level API would work.
