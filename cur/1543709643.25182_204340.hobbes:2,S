this patch did not help on my dell inspiron 3800.  the battery
status worked with 2.6.0, but it's been broken in the past
couple versions.  same as others were seeing:
ACPI-0279: *** Error: Looking up [BST0] in namespace, AE_ALREADY_EXISTS
ACPI-1120: *** Error: Method execution failed [\_SB_.BAT0._BST]
(Node d7fc7ba0), AE_ALREADY_EXISTS
i'm trying 2.6.4-rc2 with this acpi patch.
