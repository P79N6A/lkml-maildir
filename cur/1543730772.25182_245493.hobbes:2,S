Sure, this sort of thing must be sorted out at the VFS layer.
And a backup program working on such a filesystem
will need to know that something can be a file, a directory - or both.
So an old "tar" won't get this right as it will assume that an object
is either file or directory.  The change to get it right won't be
that big - just notice that an object is both, then backup the
ordinary file contents as usual, before recursing into the
directory it also provides and backup stuff there as usual.
The resulting .tar can of course only be unpacked properly
on a fs supporting file-as-directory, similiar to how a .tar of
a fs with links only will unpack properly on a fs supporting links.
I don't see much problems for userland.  Old apps will keep working,
as the new features is a superset.  Those who care about
file-as-directory extras will provide patches for "tar" and friends,
after that the extras become useable.
