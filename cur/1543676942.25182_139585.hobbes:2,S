Looks like a different issue, not dentry aliasing per se.

Yes, VFAT ends up encoding the parent directory in the FH, so renaming 
will invalidate the old file handle, and if you cache inodes (and thus 
filehandles) over a directory move, badness happens.
Arguably it's a NFS client problem - the path revalidate at open time 
should have caught the ESTALE and forced a new inode lookup. But I think 
you can also argue that VFAT over NFS is just non-unixy enough that it 
just isn't really "supported".
I think it's more of a "you can NFS-export strange filesystems for some
limited file sharing, but if things break, you get to keep both pieces".
