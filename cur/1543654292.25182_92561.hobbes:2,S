Alan mentioned some missing locking in the IDE code, I assume thats what this
is about, or does it only affect the taskfile stuff?
I started to write a driver for the Compaq triflex stuff that Alan requested,
hopefully something should come out next week.
Also, with regards to our recent talk on how windows was doing DMA handling,
the link below was brought to my attention. Disabling DMA on cd-rom driver per
default seems somewhat overkill to me.
