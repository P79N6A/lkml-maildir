It pretty much can't be a PCMCIA subsystem bug.  The basic PCMCIA code
handles card identification and configuration of the socket; however,
for almost all cards, the PCMCIA subsystem is completely out of the
loop during normal card operation.  No PCMCIA code outside of the
orinoco driver itself will ever be executed.
Your oops, in tasklet code, sounds to me like a locking bug in the
driver code for managing the transmit stack vs. interrupt handling.
Have there been reports of the driver working well on SMP boxes?
