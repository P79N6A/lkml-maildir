After a lots of private mail traffic and debuggin efforts with Ingo, yesterday 
i simply requested to ignore that problem (at least until i can reproduce 
same with different machines). 
Yesterday i turn back to vanilla 2.6.18.8 to see the situation with it and i 
reproduce the problem even with lower loads.
Seems like this piece of hardware is dieing [For a while my laptop starts to 
poweroff suddenly without any log/error etc] and i think all these problems 
caused by this. Or at least/ for me/ this laptop (sony vaio fs-215b) is not a 
stable test bed for this kind of human involved testings.
Ingo cannot reproduce same audio/video out-of-sync problems with his setups, 
and currently i'm the only person deals with that problem. 
And for some boots kernel reports wrong frequency for my cpu (and notice the 
timing difference), [this maybe a overheat problem but aslo i'll try 
disabling CONFIG_NO_HZ as Ingo suggested]

As a result, please ignore this problem until i can reproduce on different 
machines or someone else reports the same problem :)
Cheers
