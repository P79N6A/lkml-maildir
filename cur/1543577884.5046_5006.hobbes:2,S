Oh, IMHO that's not too important.
API should be accepted by you and Ulrich Drepper.
API should not be expected to return static values. (for example: reiserfs
may return different values dependend on filesystem-version)
I think the easiest way would be to define ioctls for this.
So VFS needs no changes; the only discussion would be about the
standard name for "request-names", and Ulrich could fall back to
his magic calculations if EINVAL is returned.
Because I have no knowledge on this I suggest that you and Ulrich fight
together on a more flexible solution than the current one. I guess
that Linus would accept this without thinking too much about it.
