Hello everyone. My name is Terry Vernon and I am representing a 
collaboration who are designing a security system aimed for use by the 
US DoD. We need kernel developers who are confident they can create a 
custom kernel to run a custom OS and maintain it on a regular basis. The 
software will have to meet the requirements of the TOS system and be 
rated as mission critical. If anyone is interested on working on this 
project where contracts will be offered to individuals who make the 
grade in the final stages of beta development, please email me.
I hope this request finds everyone in good spirits.
