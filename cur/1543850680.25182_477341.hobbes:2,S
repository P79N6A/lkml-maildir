When __KERNEL__ is not defined then that part of the header may be
exposed to userspace[1]. Older compilers (or newer versions of gcc with
-traditional used to compile old programs) don't recognize the keyword
'signed', hence the alternate keyword is used.
Extreme backward compatibility I'd say ;) I doubt that today is
possibile to compile anything with -traditional on a distro recent
enough to use kernel 2.6.

[1] You'd better use the cleaned up version of the headers though.
