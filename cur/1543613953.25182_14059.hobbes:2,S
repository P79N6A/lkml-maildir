Hi,
I tried out the latest cerberus from
http://people.redhat.com/bmatthews/cerberus/
 on a UP redhat-7.2 box. I ran the
standard non-destructive RedHat tests.
It ran for about 14 hours and then became unresponsive..  machine still ping'ed
, I could switch VC's scroll up on console, but that's it. Could not log in,
etc.. Another point is that the hard drive light remained on but it was not
seeking, it seemed dead silent.
Kernel was compiled using redhat's stock gcc-2.96. Unfortunatly, I did not have
sysrq turned on (I just assumed there would be no problem on UP). The machine
is very well ventilated. 
The symptoms sound very much like what Bob Matthews reported on his 8 way...
just that they take longer to manifest themselves.
I'm willing to test/provide more info. The machine is slated for production
soon so I might only have a week or 2. I'm running the tests again now with
sysrq turned on.
Machine has 128Mb, 270Mb swap, IDE, ext3. no DRI or X. stock 2.4.17-rc2 no
patches applied.
Here is dmesg, lscpci, lsmod, /proc/cpuinfo output:
