You are damned right! Sorry my mistake with the previous analysis and
(as I now find out) testing :(
There are couple of problems discovered by Suka's test:
- The test requires the cgroup filesystem to be mounted with
  atleast the cpu and ns options (i.e both namespace and cpu 
  controllers are active in the same hierarchy). 
	# mkdir /dev/cpuctl
	# mount -t cgroup -ocpu,ns none cpuctl
	(or simply)
	# mount -t cgroup none cpuctl -> Will activate all controllers
					 in same hierarchy.
- The test invokes clone() with CLONE_NEWNS set. This causes a a new child
  to be created, also a new group (do_fork->copy_namespaces->ns_cgroup_clone->
  cgroup_clone) and the child is attached to the new group (cgroup_clone->
  attach_task->sched_move_task). At this point in time, the child's scheduler 
  related fields are uninitialized (including its on_rq field, which it has
  inherited from parent). As a result sched_move_task thinks its on
  runqueue, when it isn't.
  As a solution to this problem, I moved sched_fork() call, which
  initializes scheduler related fields on a new task, before
  copy_namespaces(). I am not sure though whether moving up will
  cause other side-effects. Do you see any issue?
- The second problem exposed by this test is that task_new_fair()
  assumes that parent and child will be part of the same group (which 
  needn't be as this test shows). As a result, cfs_rq->curr can be NULL
  for the child.
  The solution is to test for curr pointer being NULL in
  task_new_fair().
With the patch below, I could run ns_exec() fine w/o a crash.
Suka, can you verify whether this patch fixes your problem?

Fix copy_namespace() <-> sched_fork() dependency in do_fork, by moving
up sched_fork().
Also introduce a NULL pointer check for 'curr' in task_new_fair().
