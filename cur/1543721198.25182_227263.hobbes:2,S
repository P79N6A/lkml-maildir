I'm not the one who invented O_NOATIME; it's the GNU people, and so I
wanted to avoid diverging from their description (the text you quoted
above is from the glibc manual).
The semantics of O_NOATIME are the same as using utimes or variants, and
utimes has the same security restriction (only the file owner or the
superuser). The only thing O_NOATIME gains is the absence of a race
condition where another program can read the file without it being noted
in the atime.
I believe the Unix philosophy is that a user can do anything with the
files he owns, with the exception that root can do anything with any
file. This is why various functions (chown, chmod, etc) check if
current->fsuid equals inode->i_uid or CAP_FOWNER is set.
If you want to use the atime as proof of wrongdoing, you probably want a
root-only O_NOATIME to avoid checksummers and backup daemons creating a
race condition due to their restoring of the old atime; however, I fail
to see how can reading a file you own would be wrongdoing. If the file
isn't yours, you can't use O_NOATIME (you get -EPERM). So, a user
ignoring atime updates on his own files is no big deal.
And finally, nothing prevents a user from running his own backup
programs/checksummers/storage managers, which would benefit from
O_NOATIME.
The atime was never intended as an auditing feature (if it were, utimes
and related functions would be root only).
