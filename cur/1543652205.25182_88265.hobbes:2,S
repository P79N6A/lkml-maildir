True.  But it is just as easy to drop the file into something like
ramfs.  Or a file on the read only file on the root filesystem.  Now
that we can having shutdown do a pivot_root and totally unmounting
the root filesystem is probably a good idea.

Well at least the part cleans up after the running kernel.  That is
what I think it takes to make it stable.  Perhaps I am wrong, but
I think getting other architecture stable is very hard.

I guess I can be proven wrong.
