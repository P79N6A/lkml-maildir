Hi!
> The current hdaps driver queries the hardware on (almost) any sysfs
> read, reading just the information it needs and discarding the rest
> This is inefficient, because every hardware query actually gives all 
> information. It also means we're losing data, because readouts are
> offered by the hardware at a constant rate and each query "eats up"
> a readout. It also results in unnecessarily complex code.
> 
> This patch moves all hardware value reading+parsing to a single 
> function, __hdaps_update(). All values are cached, and easily 
> referenced afterwards. This function is still invoked on every sysfs 
> read. This will be fixed in a later patch.

Linuxdoc, please.

Perhaps hdaps_invert should already have 1/-1 values.

I actually liked the previous version more, and this change does not
really belong here.
