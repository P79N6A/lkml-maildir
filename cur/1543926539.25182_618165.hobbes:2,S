Hi, I've just checked and it seems a bit weird, at least not as I 
expected: the workqueue is already initialized _before_ cpufreq! At 
least, from what I read in init/main.c, in do_basic_setup(), first there 
is a call to init_workqueues(), then there is a call to do_initcalls() 
(which indirectly calls cpufreq_core_init()). So maybe workqueues need 
something more than being initialized to work? What could it be? (My 
kernel is compiled for monoprocessor,  I can't see what goes wrong in 
wq_per_cpu()).
See you,
Eric
