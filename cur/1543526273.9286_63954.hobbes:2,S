Subject: Problems with network autoconfiguration for diskless clients

I use the ability to autoconfigure a diskless client via bootp before
the NFS root-file-system
could be mounted. This feature worked excelent until kernel version
2.3.42. When the kernel
came up, he first installed the driver for the SCSI controller, then he
installed the driver
for my network-card (3c95x.c 3COM) and after that he launched a BOOTP
request.
The new kernels 2.3.4[3456] start in the same order: first the SCSI
driver is installed,
but then the message
                                        IP-Config: No network devices
available.
comes up and after this the network driver 3c95x.c is installed too
late. As a consequence
the kernel hangs with the message
                                        Root-NFS: No NFS server
available, giving up.
Has anyone else the same problem and perhaps a solution?
Thanks
