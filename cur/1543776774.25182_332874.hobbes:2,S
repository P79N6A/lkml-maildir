I guess the quick motion compensation in input bites you. The above
equation should do even more smoothing than regular 4-point floating
average.

OK.

I of course won't object to the floating average in the driver if you
say it's needed, I'm just wondering what happens here, because the input
core should smooth this out as well, and if it doesn't, there may be a
problem somewhere.

That's what all other touchpads do.

I believe it'd still be more useful than a two-value (0 and 100) output.

This could be quite useful, too, for right and middle button taps (2 and
3 fingers) - since the Macs lack these buttons.
