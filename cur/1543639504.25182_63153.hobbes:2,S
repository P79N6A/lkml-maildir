It's optional: CONFIG_MODULES=n

How about partition detection?  When initramfs goes in that's one of the 
things they're threatening to move to userspace.  Also lots of the hardware 
detection and setup (ACPI, hotplug style PCI probing...)
If that sort of stuff goes into userspace, you may not be able to boot ANY 
linux system without it.

See "partition detection in userspace".  How minimal is "minimal"?

Possibly it could be gotten to work before being split off?  And then there's 
the question of upgrading your kernel without upgrading the initbootutils: if 
this never happens, what exactly is the benefit of it being in another 
tarball?  (I.E. how tight is the binding gonna be?  I certainly don't know 
yet...)
