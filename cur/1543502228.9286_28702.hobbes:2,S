I jsut noticed that not only does vfat not work but the message I sent earlier
is for the loopback device .  If I do not include that during the kernel build
the kernel compiles fine.  Except for NTFS and VFAT.   Alsi I have an awe64 pnp
and not I am told that it can not find the awe32 synth. after compiling with oss
sound support for the 16/32/64 and turning on the 32 synth in low level
