     What ELF needs is something like the (byzantine) a.out stub
     generator, where you gave it an explicit list of symbols to
     export.   This would cut down on the distressing usage of
     private symbols.

     If the infrastructure was there, I'd cheerfully use shared libraries.
     But for shared libraries to work, you need to have a fixed published
     interface and some assurance that features will keep working when
     you changed libraries.

     So SO would add ~250k to the size of their code by statically
     linking to libc?   And they'd gain independence from the library
     of the week club?   This looks like an unqualified win to me.

                    \/                  to do dlclose.  Sigh.  X is evil(tm).
