maybe you can do something with it.
occours on a scsi-server 4-pentium machine with 5-Raid5 harddisks. Never
occours before (or after since yesterday 14:00).
I'm sorry, i could not ksymoops the message, because ksymoops was not able
to translate properly (bfd.h is missing :-?) and I my chef think I have the
time to go futher into debugging things (AND I think it would relate to
nothing because I'm not very good with that ;(  )
The ascii is written down from screen, since text dump was not successfully
(even no sysrequest-keys anymore...), so I hope I made no mistakes.
After reboot (hard-boot), all seems to be ok. There were no entry in
kern.log
Bye,				Imi, :-}
