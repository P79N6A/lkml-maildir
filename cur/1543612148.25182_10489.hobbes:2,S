Huh?  We drop that lock before the return from this function.  So if you
move clear_inode() after the return, you lose that protections.
What's more, you can't more that lock_super()/unlock_super() into iput()
itself - you need it _not_ taken in the beginning of ext2_delete_inode()
and you don't want it for quite a few filesystems.
Nothing VFS-specific here, just a bog-standard "you lose protection of
semaphore once you call up()"...

Again, huh?
