Weird shutdown scripts? I believe all shutdown scripts have this issue
-- if you want to [cleanly] unmount your / filesystem, you need all
the opens for write closed, right...? Which self-deadlocked fused
holding files open will prevent.

Well, I believe code with obscure, but almost impossible to fix
problems should not be merged... because that means it will not be
fixed and we'll just have to live with broken kill -9 forever.
Anyway, I believe it would be fair to mention kill -9 no longer
working and shutdown/hibernation/multiuser problems it implies in the
changelogs and probably sysctl documentation or how is this enabled.
