Yes, or something even simpler, like mapping the owner permission bits
to CAP_SYS_ADMIN.  There seem to be very few different permissions
under /proc/sys:
--w-------
-r--r--r--
-rw-------
-rw-r--r--
As long as the group and other bits are always the same, and we accept
that the owner bits really mean CAP_SYS_ADMIN and not something else,
then the permission check would not need to look at uids or gids at
all.
