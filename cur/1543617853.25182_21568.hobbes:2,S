COPY YOUR DVD's!!
Why Spend upwards of $4000 on a DVD Burner when we will show you an alternative that will do the exact same thing for only $19.95? 
You heard us right - for the price of just 1 DVD's, we'll show you how to back up and/or create Your Own DVD's! 
Just upgraded to a DVD and still have a ton of VHS tapes lying around? With this program, not only can you burn & copy any DVD you've created, you'll also be able to transfer all your VHS tapes to DVD format as well!!
