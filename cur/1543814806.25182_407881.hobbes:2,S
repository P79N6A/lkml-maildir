Indeed, the problem is here. If I use 
DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_HEADER(PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA,     PCI_ANY_ID,    
asus_hides_ac97_lpc );
(see the PCI_ANY_ID) instead of 
DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_HEADER(PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA,   PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_8237,
asus_hides_ac97_lpc );
(and remove the check "if (likely(!asus_hides_ac97)) return;")
it works. I cannot see the output about enabling the device in "dmesg | grep
PCI", but lspci shows the audio and modem device.
And it works both with the 2.6.13 suse and 2.6.15 vanilla kernel.
I managed to hang the machine completely with skype, altough before that a
quick test showed that the device works, as I could hear the music. Maybe
it's the same problem you've experienced.
Can you tell me how can I find the real device ID for my chipset? It
*should* be the same one as the original writer of the patch wrote (he also
had an ASUS A8V Deluxe as I understood), but the experience tells it is
not.
My lspci output is:
