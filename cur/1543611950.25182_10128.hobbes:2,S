The rules are nearly the same (but written in another language).
The problem was in converting rules: esr found a lot of error:
these error should be corrected, also some rules are different.
Also converting rules, you surelly found some error: i.e. wrong
dependencies syntax, wrong implementation,....
I don't think esr changed non problematic rules, but one:
all rules without help become automatically dependent to
CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL. I don't like it, but I understand why
he makes this decision.
Remember: The config.in files contain a lot of errors, and
automatic tools can not find all.
