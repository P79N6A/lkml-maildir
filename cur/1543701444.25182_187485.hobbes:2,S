Thanks for your reply!  I have had math programs running for several days
in the past and never experienced any lockups, so I doubt that overheating
is the problem.  To make sure, I just did "while true; make clean; make; 
done" to the linux kernel in a couple of windows, unpacking / deleting in
another, math programs, etc. for a while, without any problems.  (CPU
usage was > 99%.)
In the first message I forgot to say that ping from another computer gives
nothing when the frozen one is frozen.
Also, please cc abuch@imf.au.dk (as you did, thanks!) since I'm not on the
lkml.
