As definition (a) in the OED makes clear.
But then the OED also says:
  b. Lawless, irregular. Obs. rare. 
  1728 R. MORRIS Ess. Anc. Archit. 20 How preferable the Beauties of ancient Architecture are to the illegal Practices of our modern Builders.
So if bad architecture can be illegal, I guess bad operands can be too.
