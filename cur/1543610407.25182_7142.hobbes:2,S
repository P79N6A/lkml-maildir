What are the recommended software RAID patch(es) for 2.2.20.
I have applied, but not yet tested, raid-2.2.19-A1, which
fails on one hunk in init.c which I think is unimportant
(seemingly 2.2.20 has a full boot line to device translation
table without conditionality of compilation).
Do I need to apply anything else? (-A2, -A3, -B1, -B2 or
whatever) in which case where do I get them from? (not
kernel.org/people/mingo or wherever, apparently).
