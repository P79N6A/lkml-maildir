Both /dev/sdj and /dev/sdd connect via an expander to the same
SAS disk. /dev/sdj is via the LT aic94xx driver and a PCI-X HBA.
/dev/sdd is via the mptsas driver and a SAS1068 (PCIe) based HBA.
The kernel version is 2.6.20-rc5.
Looks good to me.
You may like to check that Write Cache Enable is on with:
'sdparm --get=WCE /dev/sdd'.
