Well, glibc use it for instance as an fall-through if you do not specify
it via ./configure arguments, or environment (yes, glibc should not use
it, etc, etc, no flames please =).  So as well does alsa-driver,
nvidia's drivers (gah, puke, yes, its got some binary-only stuff in
there ;), ati's drivers and a lot of other stuff (if you really need
them all I can try to find time to look for more).
I am not sure about ati's drivers and alsa, but nvidia uses kbuild.
Thanks,
