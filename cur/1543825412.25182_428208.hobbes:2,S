Major update for the force feedback support, including a new force feedback
driver interface and two new HID ff drivers.
This is the patchset I sent in 2006-05-26 with the changes of my latest
patches integrated, as requested.
The changes are:
- make the ff module a bool instead of part of the input module, as we don't
  want to rename input.c
- use the normal event() handler in input_dev so that input.c doesn't have to
  make calls to ff code
