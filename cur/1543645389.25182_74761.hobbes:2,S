   The cache line bouncing of global_bh_lock and net_bh_lock in
   run_timer_tasklet() show up in our profiles, so getting rid of
   them is a good thing (TM).
   
What ancient protocols are you running that make use of this?
IPv4 and IPv6 both do not use it at all.  Even IPX, Appletalk, and
DecNET layers do not use it
