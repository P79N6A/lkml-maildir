It's been ages since I personally moved to 2.6, but around the time
when I made the switch I fed several 2.4 configs to oldconfig and the
resulting 2.6 kernels either didn't build properly or they build but
were broken in strange ways. Redoing the 2.6 configs from scratch
always fixed the problems back then. I also encountered similar
reports from people on IRC. Things may have improved since then, but
then again maybe they have not.. I'll see if I can dig out a few of my
old 2.4 configs and retest if there are still issues.
