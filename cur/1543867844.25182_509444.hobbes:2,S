Well, as I pointed out in other message, I think there is a difference
between using the GPL'd code (as user), and modify it, link closed
modules, create derivated closed code, and then redistribute
everything.
I'm not saying that we should prevent companies using Linux for money,
I'm just saying that if someone modify some GPL'd code or link or
something like that, he/she should release such code as GPL'd; and
that is the feedback for the original authors: The improvement of the
code.
I don't care if this this or other company makes money, it is free to
do it, but it would be better to receive feedback as opening such
closed modules. Anyway, it is not clear if opening the source would
break his business or help it.
