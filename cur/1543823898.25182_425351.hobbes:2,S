We don't.  We write the control and journaled metadata buffers first,
recording them on the t_buffers and t_log_list lists.  We then wait on
both of those lists, but there's no IO being submitted at that stage and
the order in which we wait on them has no effect at all on the progress
of the IO.
The sync_datalist writes could be waited for separately at the end if we
wanted too.  That code was written a _long_ time ago but I vaguely
recall some reasoning that we may have a lot more data than metadata, so
it would be reasonable to cleanup the data writes as quickly as possible
and to prevent data and metadata writes from getting submitted in
parallel and potentially causing seeks between the two.  The elevator
should prevent the latter effect, though, so it would be entirely
reasonable to move that wait to later on in commit if we wanted to.

It would be entirely reasonable to do that, sure.  It just hasn't been
done yet.

Not likely. :-)

It fails with EOPNOTSUPP and must be retried, iirc.
