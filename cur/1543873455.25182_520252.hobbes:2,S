Hiroshi Miura posted `Geode out-of-order store enables' patch in Jun, 2003.
There is 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/6/5/57
 .
OOSTORE was enabled at this point in time. It seems to have disappeared somewhere.
BTW, I use MediaGX with kernel 2.6.20(and 2.6.20.3) and suspend2. When I resume 
the PC and use the PC Card modem, PC is hungup. However, PC isn't hung up when
I apply a WBINVD patch.
I can't understand it whether there is problem in resume of suspend2 or MediaGX
or both. Many drivers lack support for resume on my PC.
