Yes, but not really important:  10-byte allows a 16-bit allocation 
length (additional data section), where 6-byte only allows 8-bit.
However, the mode pages the kernel requests from the device are normally 
<= 256 bytes.
In general, your intuition is correct.  use_10_for_foo is largely meant 
for the subclass of "SCSI" devices which often don't bother to implement 
the 6-byte commands, forcing the software driver to emulate 6-byte. 
use_10_for_foo allows the software driver to eliminate that in-kernel 
emulation code.
