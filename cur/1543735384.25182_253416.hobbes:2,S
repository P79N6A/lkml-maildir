Well, it appears that my home system only has a 32bit adapter as well (see 
below).
0000:00:0b.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8169 
Gigabit Ethernet (rev 10)
        Subsystem: Micro-Star International Co., Ltd.: Unknown device 702c
        Flags: bus master, 66Mhz, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 16
        I/O ports at c800 [size=cff20000]
        Memory at cfffb700 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=256]
        Expansion ROM at 00020000 [disabled]
        Capabilities: [dc] Power Management version 2
Before I make any sweeping comments about the performance on ppc64, I should 
probably do some more tests.  I'll have to get back to you regarding that.
Would you like me to run the "Config2" patch on my amd64 system?
