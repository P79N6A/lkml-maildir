So we follow dhowell's plan with the following additions:
a) during the transition, include/linux/foo.h includes
include/user/foo.h if it exists and similarly for asm-*
b) when include/user is deemed sufficiently populated, a flag day is
declared and links from /usr/include are switched to them
c) #define __KERNEL__ is dropped from the compile
d) extraneous include/user/* includes are removed from include/linux
(though they'll often make perfect sense)
Step b) may be a long time in coming, but for interfaces where kernel
headers are frequently abused, we can start feeling benefits.

Even so, it's sometimes important for everyone to agree on a
destination before they set out..
