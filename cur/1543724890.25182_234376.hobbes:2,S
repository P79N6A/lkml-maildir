Checked the cabling and switch and that wasn't it either.
This seems related to what I was seeing:
https://qa.mandrakesoft.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1546
I recompiled the realtek nic driver to show me debugging information,
and in fact, it wasn't even showing interrupts on pings during the 'outage'.
If anyone has ideas on how to track down the buggy software, I'm willing
to try them out, but I don't have the know-how to chase this down on my
own.  Maybe it's a known problem and already being worked on...
Thankyou,
