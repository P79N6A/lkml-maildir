Subject: [RFC][PATCH] Use proper casting with signed timespec.tv_nsec values
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/1/298

All,
	I recently ran into a bug with an older kernel where xtime's tv_nsec
field had accumulated more then 2 seconds worth of time. The timespec's
tv_nsec is a signed long, however gettimeofday() treats it as an
unsigned long. Thus when the failure occured, very strange and difficult
to debug time problems occurred.
The main cause of the problem I was seeing is already fixed in mainline,
however just to be safe, I figured the following patch would be wise.
I only audited i386 and x86_64, however other arches probably could have
similar signed problems as well.
Please let me know if you have any further comments or feedback.
thanks
