These options are self-explanatory:
      x x          ( ) No Forced Preemption (Server)                     x 
x    x x          ( ) Voluntary Kernel Preemption (Desktop)             x 
x    x x          (X) Preemptible Kernel (Low-Latency Desktop)          x x
It says 100 HZ or 250 HZ is good for SMP systems; however, what if I am 
using a P4 machine with 1 CPU (HT), is 1000HZ still the way to go, as its 
not really 2 *REAL* cpus?
