Yes, one cycle, and it's completely lost in the noise when it
happens.

It's not the TCP/IP headers intrinsically, it's what they are embedded
inside of.
For example, if the ethernet driver (as nearly all of our's do which
can) optimized for an ethernet header followed by an IP header, guess
what?  That causes ethernet header followed by appletalk followed
by IP to do unaligned accesses.
It is an unavoidable axoim in the kernel networking.  Unaligned accesses
will happen, and they aren't a bug and therefore not worthy of mention
in the kernel logs any more than "page was freed" :-)
