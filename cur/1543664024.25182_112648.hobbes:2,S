But min=max=freq is awful... I know, I reccommended it sometimes, but with
the appearance of the userspace governor (already available on the cpufreq
homepage, 
http://www.brodo.de/cpufreq/advanced.html
 , will be submitted
soon) min=max=freq is deprecated.

No. Intel doesn't let you select the exact voltage. IIRC, only vew 
VIA/Cyrix-longhaul-capable processors and, of course, powernow-k7 are vaild
targets for such a patch.
