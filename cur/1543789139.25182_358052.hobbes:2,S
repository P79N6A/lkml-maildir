could you try:
	strace -o log sleep 10
and wait for a failure, and send us the log? Is it perhaps nanosleep 
unexpectedly returning with -EAGAIN or -512? There's a transient 
nanosleep failure that happens on really fast boxes, which we havent 
gotten to the bottom yet. That problem is very sporadic, but maybe your 
box is just too fast and triggers it more likely :-)
