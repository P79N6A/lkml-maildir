tq_immediate looks to be some very old piece of kernel infrastructure
which is somewhat obsolete but all the users have not been converted
to yet.  May run in interrupt context.  
tq_scheduler callbacks run in process context.  Use schedule_task()
instead.
These mechanisms are discussed in the Rubini/Corbet bible:
