Your dump is showing only one direction of the connection. The receive
window visible in this dump is used for the reverse direction. Use
"tcpdump port 80" instead to get some useful output. 
Linux 2.4 starts with a small receive window and rapidly increases it
when the data starts to flow. This is a type of receiver oriented
congestion control. You don't see the window increase here, because
there is very little data sent from client to server. 
Also, next time try not to wrap the dump output. Beastly hard to make
sense of.
