	gcc -I/usr/src/linux-2.6.2/include
... if you are sure that's what you want. Normally, you use the
headers that your 'C' runtime library was compiled with, i.e.,
what's in /usr/include.
gcc will search the -I/path first, then do the other ones unless
you use  -nostdinc on the command-line as well. If you use
-nostdinc, you need to also put -I`gcc -print-file-name=include` on
the command line, also or else gcc won't find stddef.h, etc., which
are not in one of the "standard places".
Cheers,
