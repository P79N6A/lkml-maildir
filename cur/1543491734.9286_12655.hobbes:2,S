Today , I happened to play with dmesg and found one strange thing that
dmesg output is full of such message :
ip_rt_advice: redirect to 207.179.39.5/00 dropped
ip_rt_advice: redirect to 207.179.39.5/00 dropped
ip_rt_advice: redirect to 207.179.39.5/00 dropped
ip_rt_advice: redirect to 207.179.39.5/00 dropped
What happens ?The kernel is 2.2.3 . It works well and response time
is wonderful except this annoyance .
