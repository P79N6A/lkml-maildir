Hi!
Fork behaves other than normal syscalls -- debugger is not called at
syscall exit. This patch fixes that. It does touch only return path
from fork(), which is "cold enough". Ability to change registers after
fork() is essential if strace wants to work correctly with clone().
[patch is against 42, but I checked it applies to 46]
