                   Using [0] here would also work 
and fixing other code to add DNAME_INLINE_MIN as needed. Unfortunately
this "fixing other code" would likely prevent the patch going into 2.4,
which would be bad. 
#define d_... has a similar problem => the potential to break previously
compiling source code.
Probably just using an compiler #ifdef is best, and perhaps doing it 
cleanly (with using d_iname[0]) on 2.5.

P.S.: I originally picked the 16 number and it was totally arbitary, so 
an increase on the fallback to 20-30 would be likely ok.
