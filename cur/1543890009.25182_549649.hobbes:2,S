I'd really prefer to keep an intact embedded ELF file rather than have a
semi-ELF file.  That way it would be easier to simply load the image and
point the normal ELF machinery at some offset into the file rather than
having to have a special handler for "\x7fBZE" or whatever.

How does the kernel specify what memory it requires to be mapped (both
for the image itself, and for any memory it needs to use to
decompress/relocate the final kernel image).
If its by using ELF Phdrs, then we need to:
   1. specify the constraints on what mappings are allowed,
   2. specify how the bootloader uses the mappings, and
   3. specify how the ELF file is to be found.
If the bzImage is really a plain ELF file, then 3 is a non-issue. 
Otherwise, should we allocate a field which specifies the offset of the
ELF header within the bzImage, and make all offsets contained in the ELF
header relative to the header itself rather than the overall bzImage?
As far as 1 and 2 go, I propose:
Requirements on the Phdrs in the image:
   1. the Phdrs must map the actual bzImage code and data, with
      appropriate filesz and memsz
   2. the Phdrs must also map all the other memory needed to
      decompress/relocate the kernel, with filesz=0 and memsz set
      appropriately
   3. the Phdr mappings must always be 1:1 (ie, P=V), and RW(X)
   4. the mappings must be as low as possible, to avoid any hole the
      hypervisor requires (if the mappings are too high, the bootloader
      may just fail to start the kernel)
Requirements for the bootloader:
   1. it is always correct for the bootloader to simply leave paging
      disabled; presumably the subarch will tell the kernel that it
      needs to set up its own initial mappings
   2. if paging is enabled, the bootloader creates mappings:
         1. with PAE set to match the kernel's requirements (this
            suggests that loadflags should have a PAE/non-PAE flag)
         2. all mappings are RWX (ie, RW, no NX) [ rationale: this means
            we don't need to deal with pages of different
            types/permissions at this stage of booting, which might be
            especially awkward when recycling pages ]
         3. mappings covering at least the ones specified by the Phdrs,
            but it is acceptible to over-map (for example, map the
            entire address space)
         4. Other non-1:1 mappings may exist outside the image's Phdrs
            (for example, containing the initial pagetables, hypervisor
            address space, and other mappings)

+ Bit 5 (read): PAE mode

+        - if 0, enable non-PAE mode paging
+        - if 1, enable PAE mode paging

So does this mean the bootloader has set up a kernel-compatible GDT?  Or
does it also mean "set up a GDT"?
