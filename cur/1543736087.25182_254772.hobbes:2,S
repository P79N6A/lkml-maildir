Bjorn,
I just sent you email (because dmesg told me too :D ) with exactly the
same error message. However, for me it only occurs without
"pci=routeirq".
Does the DL360 have a BIOS option to allow "legacy usb devices"?
My notebook does, and if set to yes, it fails with that error with or
without pci=routeirq.
Cheers,
    Andre
