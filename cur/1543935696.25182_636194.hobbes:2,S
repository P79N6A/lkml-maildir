We're not talking about "a" additional line. In my case [1] we're talking
about 22 (!) additional identical lines.
Not fixing this before 2.6.24 seems completely inconsistent:
- either this is a real bug and the ERR level message is correct, in which
  case the limits should be increased;
- or hitting the limits is harmless and the message should be changed to
  DEBUG level.
It is great to hear that the memory allocation will become dynamic in the
future and maybe that could just justify your standpoint, but having the
messages is damn ugly and alarming from a user point of view.
Please keep in mind that depending on distro release schedules, 2.6.24 could
live for quite a bit longer than just the period needed to release 2.6.25
(if that is when the dynamic allocation will be implemented).
Cheers,
