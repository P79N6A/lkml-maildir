interesting, i'll try to reproduce this.
btw., for best rtc_wakeup results you should chrt IRQ#0 to prio 99 too,
because it uses rtc_lock, otherwise it's an extra PI pass to undo the
lock inversion, which adds another 10 usecs or so to the worst-case
path.
and i'd suggest to chrt irq 1 back to below prio 90, maybe this explains
the console-switching latency? If you do a console-switch via the
keyboard then its priority 99 can get inherited by events/0 which then
does the quite expensive VGA console clearing/copying with priority 99,
possibly delaying rtc_wakeup quite significantly, easily for a
millisecond or so. So what you are seeing might be priority inheritance
handling at work!

could you post such a large latency trace? Are they like the bad traces
Mark is occasionally seeing, with some ridiculously large latency and a
ridiculously short execution trace?
