I posted the following message here some weeks ago.
I formally apologize to George France, and to the list for my message,
and formally retract it.
The quotation in my message was my own, personal interpretation; 
George France did not say those words.
I certainly never intended to misrepresent George France, and I sincerely
apologize to George France for any misunderstandings I may have caused.
sincerely, Mark Hahn.

uh, this will be unpleasantly familiar to anyone who
was reading the linux-usb mailing list in Dec 99,
when George said, roughly "you are all so full of shit
that you're not worth working with, so on Monday we will begin 
designing our own USB for Linux".
Linux USB has survived quite nicely in spite of this,
which bodes quite well for ARM-linux ;)
