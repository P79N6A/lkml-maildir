   This is exactly what I've proposed, but Linus insisted on keeping
the name list, so I've to surrender.  Anyway, I'll write a simple
script generating the kernel ID list from the pci.id file, so that
it will be up to date.

   I think this should be handled by the drivers itself since such
additional resources always correspond to legacy I/O ports and the
driver usually needn't know about which PCI devices really responds
to these ports.
				Have a nice fortnight
