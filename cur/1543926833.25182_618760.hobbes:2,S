Hello Steven,
> It should print out warnings, do you have CONFIG_DEBUG_RT_MUTEXES set?
Nope, not yet... I will do that on Monday also. (On ARM I have as less
as debug options enabled per default, because it eats too much
CPU-power)

Very strange, although there is now a real mutex in non-RT as in RT,
all semaphores are still converted to some
badly-implemented-recursive-but-not-recursive-callable-mutexes,
because the assumption is made that semaphores are intentionally
always used in the wrong way?!!
So, the code that is written nicely must be adapted to prevent
adaption of bad code?
I would expect a more logical solution like the introduction of raw_
types for the exceptions, just like what is done with spinlocks and so
on.

Up to this semaphore implementation the standard was always that a
driver written for a non-RT kernel should compile and work properly
without any adaption on a RT-kernel, until there are some specific
realtime requirements.
When it comes to semaphores this is thus completely not true.
And this is where the whole thing confused me completely.

Enough said...

Or there should be a real recursive mutex implementation. But the need
for recursive mutexes is usually a sign for bad locking, and should
therefor be avoided.

I will work on an example like this on Monday.

I agree.

I will make time ;-)

Unloading of a module is not possible as long as there is still a
handle open to it. So, it should be safe without waking up the thread.
And returning from the read call and still have a mutex locked is not
nice either.
Thanks for the explanation. I will keep you informed on Monday.
Have a nice weekend !
