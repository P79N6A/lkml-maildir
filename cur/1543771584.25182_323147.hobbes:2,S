I thought apcuspd was a third party project, sourceforce shows it as a 
project. Didn't know APC was actually "providing" anything, is the 
driver on the CD now? Sure wasn't on the APC CD I had, I did have it at 
one time, but it didn't come with the UPS (at that time).

You don't have Staples or Wal-Mart? Office Max did drop the UPS, the 
local store manager said the issue was margin, hadn't had enough returns 
on either brand to be meaningful.
