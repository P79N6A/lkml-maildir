I ran into the same problems with the same driver.  Sharing an interrupt
isn't the problem, it's just a really young driver.  The ALSA driver
works fine, but I switched to an Ensoniq/Creative PCI card because I
found that the chipset just clipped like mad anyway (just cheapness, I
suppose, or maybe I'm doing something wrong) when mixing sounds together
(as in Quake3 or esd).  If you want to use it, though, I'd suggest using
ALSA.  It works.  Alternatively, you could fix the OSS driver.
