We can do this, for some device types. Not just for boot, but for hotplug type 
devices as well. The kernel option is CONFIG_HOTPLUG, and it signals 
userspace to describe what went on.
It is not appropriate for the kernel to decide what goes on (eg, if you attach 
a USB scanner, whether you'd like to load the necessary kernel modules, start 
up KDE and kooka, start a scan and save to /tmp/pr0n; or just ignore it for 
now because the scanner is noisy, and you'll start it running overnight from 
a cron job). So we make such policy decisions in userspace. This is normally 
some shell script run as /sbin/hotplug (although you can change the script 
name using a /proc interface). Sample scripts can be downloaded from 
http://linux-hotplug.sf.net
, which has lots more documentation on this.
Does this address your concern?
Brad
