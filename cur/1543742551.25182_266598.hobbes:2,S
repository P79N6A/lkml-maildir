Because all functions in the frontend are marked static and are accessible
only via ioctl.
Anyway, I think the drivers can make do without the
agp_backend_acquire/release() functions, since all they do is
increment/decrement  a use count field.  I don't know about agp_copy_info()
but it might be possible to get the agp information from pci_dev structure.
This part I'm not sure.
What's wrong with exporting the symbols back again?
