There's something even scarier - O(1) being taken out and replaced by multiple
new things, none of which ever gets fully tested because if one misbehaves,
the user says "so what" and tries another one without bothering to file a bug
report...
Been there, done that - I found a timing hole in the pluggable I/O schedulers
that probably nobody had managed to hit because there were 3 or 4 choices
available, and they just set a default they liked.  Turned out there was a
race condition if I/O happened while schedulers were being swapped.
