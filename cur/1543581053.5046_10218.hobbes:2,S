Kiobufs have never, ever required the IO to be aligned on any
particular boundary.  They simply make the assumption that the
underlying buffered object can be described in terms of pages with
some arbitrary (non-aligned) start/offset.  Every video framebuffer
I've ever seen satisfies that, so you can easily map an arbitrary
contiguous region of the framebuffer with a kiobuf already.
