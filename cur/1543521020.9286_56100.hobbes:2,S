I don't know. I just checked my source archive: linux-1.2.13 uses
"jiffies++", and 2.0.38 uses "(*(...))".
I don't know why this cast was added, but it doesn't enforce atomicity on
SMP computers. _If_ we really need the atomicity, then something like this
could fix the problem:
- unsigned long volatile jiffies = 0;
+atomic_t atomic_jiffies = ATOMIC_INIT(0);
+ #define INC_JIFFIES()    atomic_inc(&atomic_jiffies);
+ #defien ADD_JIFFIES(inc)    atomci_add(&atomic_jiffies,inc);
+ #define jiffies        ((unsigned long) atomic_get(&atomic_jiffies));
Warning: I never tried that, I didn't check if it will be correct on 64-bit
archs, ...
