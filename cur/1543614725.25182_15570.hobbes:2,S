I made all intermediate versions to work.
The problem is introduced in 1.5pre-g2 by the following change:
diff -urN callisto-1.5g-pre2a/sym53c8xx.c callisto-1.5g-pre2+/sym53c8xx.c

This change causes the PCI latency timer to be changed from 0 to 80.
The sym-2 driver has a define for modifying the PCI latency timer
(SYM_SETUP_PCI_FIX_UP), but it is never used, so I see no corruption.
Is this a hardware bug in my SCSI host adapter (53c875 rev 04) or my host
bridge (VLSI VAS96011/12 Golden Gate II for PPC), or a software bug in the
driver (wrong burst_max)?
To recapitulate, the bug causes error bursts of (almost always) 32 bytes long.
The incorrect bytes are always a copy of previous data, at a fixed offset (10
kiB on my (now dead) DDS-1 tape drive, 32 kiB on my Plexwriter).
