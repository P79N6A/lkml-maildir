It also depends on how exactly the hash table is implemented. One
could start out with a reasonable default size that is good for a
couple of thousand entries and then provide the tools to enlarge it as
needed or make a rewrite/enlargement happen automatically whenever
necessary.

The "classic" approach for a large on-disk sorted list would be a B+
tree which would solve the insertion performance problem. On the other
hand, it might be a bit of overkill just to keep track of quotas.

Here is one (requires a bit of modification, though):
