Hi Linus and Rik,
The last for(;;) loop in mm/page_allo.c:__alloc_pages() looks strange to
me:
        for (;;) {
                struct page * page = NULL;
                ...
                if (direct_reclaim)
                        page = reclaim_page(z);
                if (page)
                        return page;
               
                ....
                if (!page)
                        page = rmqueue(z, order);
                if (page)
                        return page;
        }
a) if direct_reclaim == 0 then page will remain NULL so the
if(page) should be moved inside if(direct_reclaim) instead of being tested
on each iteration unnecessarily.
b) if (!page) is redundant as page==NULL at that point, if it wasn't then
it would have been returned earlier
Am I missing something obvious? Or perhaps one should remember the fact
that 'int x = 0' inside for(;;) means x is set to 0 on each for()
iteration.... :)
Here is the patch, tested under 2.4.0-test10-pre3 (also removed redundant
page = NULL at the beginning).
Regards,
Tigran
