He said that raid wasn't on /dev/hda, which is where he saw the fault...
thx@rivalnet.de has been helping track this issue down, and I know he's
encountered this situation without raid installed at all... we both have.  I
think until we've essentially eliminated the possibility of ide problems,
all of these ide + smp + raid issues should be considered ide _ smp
problems.. and not raid.  My experience with RAID is that is has no such
issues... and after all, all of the traces we've seen have been inside the
ide subsystem, never inside of raid.
