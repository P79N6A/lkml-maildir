I think it does hurt.
- I have seen the case of MPT fusion drvier. It takes significantly more
  time to come up if we choose to reset the device during initialization.
  One of the reasons that we wait in a tight loop for the controller to 
  come up after a reset message.
- Long back we fixed ips driver and I remember that the maintainer had
  a similar issue with the reset of device. He did not want to reset the
  device in normal boot because otherwise it took significantly longer
  for the driver to initialize.
- Just now Mike also confirmed that resetting the device definitely
  hurts in terms of time.

So it is matter of making a choice in case the device does not have a
software reset capability.
- Either try to make driver work through some hacks based on crashboot
  option.
- Or mark the driver unusable in kdump scenarios.
Even if one decides to go for second option, at least "crashboot" or
similar parameter will be required so that driver can choose whether
to reset the device or not during initialization due to significant
time penalty.
