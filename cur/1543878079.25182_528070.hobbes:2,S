It's actually a long standing bug in the 3w-xxxx driver.  Apparently it
assumes request sense is always the use_sg == 0 case.  This is what it
does on a request sense:
static int tw_scsiop_request_sense(TW_Device_Extension *tw_dev, int request_id)
{
        dprintk(KERN_NOTICE "3w-xxxx: tw_scsiop_request_sense()\n");
        /* For now we just zero the request buffer */
        memset(tw_dev->srb[request_id]->request_buffer, 0, tw_dev->srb[request_id]->request_bufflen);
        tw_dev->state[request_id] = TW_S_COMPLETED;
        tw_state_request_finish(tw_dev, request_id);
....
Note that it's clearing the request buffer, which is actually zeroing the scatterlist, hence the problem.
