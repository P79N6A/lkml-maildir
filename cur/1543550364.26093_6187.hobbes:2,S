And then there isn't anything I could see which would prohibit anybody
from taking gcc-2.96 and ship it in any distro they wish too.
Alan you are in full right here the gcc-2.96 DOES a significantly
*better* job on in esp. C++ for example then any other gcc before - at 
least on the arch's which really matter those days. The PGCC never
really worked. In fact on TeX at least it generated worder 
code then the plain gcc-2.7.3 those day's....
