problem is that wpa_supplicant needs to set wpa_enabled unconditionally, so 
with this  change it hasn't been possible to connect to non-WPA networks 
using WPA supplicant. For the discussion on the IPW list, see 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=114004412300002&r=1&w=2 .
1.0.12 fixes this by removing the check entirely. James: Does it makes sense 
for you to push 1.1.0 out to netdev soon, or better just the fix for this?
