Subject: Kernel panic in 2.2.2 and 2.2.1...

I can trigger kernel panic from:
/usr/src/linux/net/unix/garbage.c:
[...]
extern inline void push_stack(unix_socket *x)
{
        if (in_stack == max_stack)
                panic("can't push onto full stack");
        stack[in_stack++] = x;
}
[...]
I can fill the stack by sysloging everything with level info, and
opening a lot of connections to that box (e.g.. ssh).
I consider it to be a "DoS" window, and even though some people would
not suffer from this, I think it's still worth fixing - esp. since Linux
is getting more recognition from commercial vendors like Dell or H-P.
Thanks!
