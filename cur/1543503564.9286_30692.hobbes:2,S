i agree (not that my opinion counts, since i'm not a kernel hacker) -
perl doesn't belong in the kernel.

SpeedyCGI is what you want. it's mostly used for cgi stuff but is
generically useful for any perl script...it does for any perl script
what mod_perl does for apache & CGI: makes the script "persistent". any
script which takes a long time to start up, compile, load config files,
or initialise variables will benefit.
