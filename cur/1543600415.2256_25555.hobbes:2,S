You are making unjustified assumptions:
If the kernel knows about subnets, then an application should be
able to find out about them. Whether or not you agree with the
application's reasons does not matter.
To close with yet another analogy:
A musician complained to Mozart that his music was so difficult to
play. Mozart asked: are these notes on your instrument? The musician
replied: yes. Mozart said: so play these notes.
