Oh, true.

Well... it goes against our usual stance of trying to push
these kinds of synchronisation issues to userspace.
In a way, you're doing direct-io from the network and so it is
perhaps reasonable to expect the racy semantics that O_DIRECT
has. OTOH, if you are providing the same API on a different
device, then basically by definition you need to provide the
exact same semantics.

I think it might be possible to solve it with the early-copy in
fork(). I'll tinker with it.
