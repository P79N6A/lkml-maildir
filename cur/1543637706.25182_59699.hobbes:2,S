If this is viewed as a configuration-related issue, I'll volunteer to 
collect the "working" vs "broken" configurations.  If you want to 
participate please send me the output of lspci -v, /proc/cpuinfo, 
motherboard and bios identification, IDE revision version, and kernel 
version.  Also, please enumerate what devices are on each IDE channel.
Since this is aimed at helping Linus and Martin, please use the "standard" 
IDE code.  I believe 2.5.29 is up to IDE version IDE-107.  Let's start 
with that as a base.
