you can speed up the client significantly by using the MSG_TRUNC option
('truncate message'). It will zap incoming data without copying it into
user-space. (you can use this for the 'bulk transfer' part - the initial
protocol handling code needs to see the actual data.) This way you should
be able to saturate the server even more.
