True, but the extra cost is to evaluate
if (namelen > 2 || name[0] != '.'||(name[1] != '.' && name[1] != '\0')
as false.  That's not going to take long most of the time.  And this
solution has two other big advantages: it fixes things for all lookups,
not just NFS, and hence is safer against this bug cropping up again in
the future in unexpected places; and it includes less dependency on
htree internals, as Andreas said.
I'll have a closer review of the patch, but for now I think I like
Andreas's version better.
Cheers,
 Stephen
