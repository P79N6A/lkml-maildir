hi
A small observation. In crypto/api.c in linux-2.6.8.1
The function:
int crypto_alg_available(const char *name, u32 flags)
has a flags param which does not seem to be used.
though it does not matter much but has this been fixed in later releases?
xfrm functions in ipsec do call this function but always with flags as 0.
Thanks and regards
kausty
