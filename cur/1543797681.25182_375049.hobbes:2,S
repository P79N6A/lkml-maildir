Certainly not.  But I was re-emphasizing that zero-init rule,
in a different part of my reply.

What information there _isn't_ in the "have to expose" category?
Yours certainly has some ... clocks as per-message not per-device,
and your message utilities still doing kmalloc() and memcpy() in
places where it's not clearly necessary.  Plus the error-prone
notion that completion callbacks could be optional, and a few
other things I've pointed out previously.
The choice of an array of spi_transfer rather than a custom
singly linked list (not even list_head)?  I just picked the
one with the smallest mandatory overhead (including adding the
least number of fault cases to test and recover from).  Lots of
APIs made the same choice; it works just fine here.  Heck, it's
one of the few things here that resembles the I2C API!

No, as I explained before.  But I'd not mind having optional layers
like that, so long as they were in fact optional.  Yours is not; plus
it's heavy-weight (embedding mallocation of dma bounce buffers and
copying into/out of them, even when it's not necessary) and it's not
refcounted.

No, you have no get/put krefcounting, and (to repeat an earlier
comment) you also require "ntrans" separate allocations.  So
"what 'we' do in the latest one" is substantially different.

In terms of potential faults that requires (debugging) driver code to
recover from, having a single allocation is a clear win.  Have you
ever noticed now many patches go into Linux to handle cases where
driver fault cleanup got confused, and oopsed in one of the less
common (but still observed in the Real World) scenarios?

I thought about such an "add" call, but there'd need to be three of them
(to add a TX buffer, an RX buffer, or both TX and RX buffers) and it really
doesn't seem even conceptually hard to expect folk to write
	msg->transfer[0].tx_buf = ...;
	msg->transfer[0].length = ...;
	msg->transfer[1].rx_buf = ...;
	msg->transfer[1].length = ...;
	msg->transfer[2].tx_buf = ...;
	msg->transfer[2].rx_buf = ...;
	msg->transfer[2].length = ...;
And in fact, having that stuff explicit seems preferable to me; no point
in "convenience" wrappers for something already that simple.
The only potentially useful thing about an spi_transfer_add_{rx,tx,txrx}()
set of inlines would be that it might make the protocol tweaking options
stand out more.  Say, like the "drop chipselect for 20 usec after this
and before the next one", or other customization.  Me, I'd rather highlight
such options with intelligent use of whitespace and comments.

You've heard where and why I disagree.  But I'd probably not turn down a
patch that adds optional krefcounting support for spi_message, returning
a message with the transfer[] array ready to be filled out.
