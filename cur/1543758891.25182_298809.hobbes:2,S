There was (is) a bug in -rc4-mm1 that may still be there in -rc5-mm1 related to the way RAID-5 and 
RAID-6 writes out blocks that can cause a deadlock in the raid code. Do you processes just hang in 
the D state and any access to /proc/mdstat do the same thing?
Can you try with just 2.6.11+libata+libata-dev?
I moved to 2.6.11+libata+libata-dev+netdev and all my problems went away.
