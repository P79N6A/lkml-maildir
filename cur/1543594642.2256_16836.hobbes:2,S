It could be that you have to wait() for the child before times()
includes it in 'children time'.
By the way, the source for time is easy to find.  Here's debian's
(just search for time.c, then click on 'main'):
http://src.openresources.com/debian/src/utils/HTML/mains.html
If that doesn't help, maybe the code I sent you that reads /proc/pid/stat
for all threads of interest will.  Either way, let me know...
