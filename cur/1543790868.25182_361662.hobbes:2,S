There is absolutely nothing preventing people from working on bugs at any
time!  It's not as if a bugfix can ever come too early.

Nobody knows when a kernel will be released, because it's released
according to perceived bug status, not according to a preconceived
timeline.

we *know* the release is weeks away - it's always been thus.
