Agreed.   The problem is that I loose consistency with the other proc
lookup methods.  If it wasn't for the call to security_task_inode I could use
proc_pident_lookup.  Getting some common helpers is still a direction
I want to pursue,  though not as much as I want to kill the hard
coded inode numbers.
Now maybe that means I need to remove the trailing empty entry on
all of the struct pid_entry candidates.
Another part of it is that I would like to convert from an array
of pid_entries into a linked list, eventually so I can have subsystems
that register their proc entries instead of having code that is riddled
with ifdefs.
