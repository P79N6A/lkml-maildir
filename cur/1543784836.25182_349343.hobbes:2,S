That really isn't something that a drive should do.  If a write fails,
you need to be told that it failed.  If anything else happens, maybe
you should consider boycotting that manufacturer, or at least buying
more expensive drives (do I guess right that there were fairly
cheap??).

No, I don't think so.  The overhead would be substantial, so people
would be very unlikely to use it.
Checking of the correctness of the data is really best done in
hardware - in the drive itself.  That's what CRC fields (or whatever
they use today) in the physical sectors are for...
Sun's new ZFS file system (don't know if it's released yet) has a
fairly cute idea.  Instead of just storing the address of each data
block in a files index information, they also store a checksum and
potentially multiple physical addresses.   When loading the data, they
(maybe optionally) check the checksum (it would be nice if that could
be hardware accelerated!).  If the check fails, either flag an error,
or try to read from another location.
I think doing this in the filesystem is a much better idea than trying
to do it in the raid layer.
The only raid-layer option that I can think of that makes much sense
is to have a regular background scan that reads all blocks and makes
sure all mirrors are consistent.  If an error is found, you generate a
warning and possibly fix it.  This wouldn't report errors immediately,
but at least you would find out proactively instead of through weird
data corruption.
I'm working towards this functionality, but it is still a little way
off.
