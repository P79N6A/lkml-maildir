3. just counting mlocked pages....
I have an experience that I was asked by the user to calculate "free" pages
on the system where several big 'mlockall' process runs, which shared amounts of
pages...when I answered the user cannot trust the result of "/bin/free" 
if you use mlock processes.
It was very fun :P
