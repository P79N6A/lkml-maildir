Of course they must be created in a directory when the evil user has
write, from a directory where the evil user has... have to check if
that's read or just evecute.

Not unless the admin is a total bozo... remember hard links must be in
the same filesystem, and I wouldn't expect untrusted users to have write
in /usr, /var, /lib or /opt, which is where the problem might likely to
exist.

See above, this is less likely that you make it sound.

While I think you're overblowing the problem, it is an issue which might
be addressed in SE Linux or somewhere. I have an idea on that, but I
want to look before I suggest anything.

Bear in mind it isn't a "problem" it's 'expected behaviour" for the o/s,
and might even be mentioned in SuS somehow. Interesting topic, but not a
bug, since the behaviour is as intended.
