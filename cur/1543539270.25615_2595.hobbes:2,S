Hi,
	As I've noticed, on SMP build (though in single-CPU BOX)
	value of kstat.cpu_system is incorrect - it always
	increasing, so I've 100% CPU load always (and no idle ticks).
	However, CPU is (in fact) not in use.
	Problems exists since 2.4.0-test3, there were some changes
	in code related to this calculation (although it is not clear
	for me why).
	Anyone has simple solution to this? :) (Please do not suggest
	not to use SMP build :)).
	Thanks!
