Okay before you add to the nvramrc you also need to add probe-all to build the
device tree first; I assumed this was common knowledge.
probe-all
" /pci/isa/8042" find-device
" 8042" encode-string device-type
install-console
banner
That should do it. Without probe-all/install-console/banner in the nvramrc they
will be run by the boot process (this is documented in the IEEE 1275 specs)
Yeah it will break for people on their first boot but let's put a few things
across;
1) Pegasos has been discontinued. The number of people with this bug are in
the low thousands - if they upgrade to 2.6.22 at all.
2) The fix was in the wrong place anyway, if it was going to be done anywhere
at all it needs to be in arch/powerpc/kernel/prom_init.c:fixup_device_tree_chrp()
like the ISA ranges breakage (which is on Briq) and IDE IRQ misnumbering fix.
Not the keyboard platform driver.
3) In any case this should be something that is fixed in the firmware, as any
stalwart, stubborn Linux developer will rant at you about. If you can't get a
firmware update or it's not fixed, this is the best place to do it.
As for Segher, bootwrapper not such a good place as that's still mussing up
the kernel with these fixes. Let the boot loader do it for the OS, and don't
mess up the OS with device-tree fixups. After all it may not just be Linux
that stumbles on it. Why have the same patch in every OS?
With nvramrc, the fix is done for EVERY operating system from firmware upwards.
The semi-official Genesi line of support and what I have been told by the board
designer is if you need to fix something in the device tree, that is what nvramrc
is for, and that is why Open Firmware runs Forth scripts.
I have a fixup script for Pegasos and one for Efika which I may publish at some
point in the very near future. We may ship a small patch for Marcin Kurek's
"BootCreator" (
http://tbs-software.com/morgoth/projects.html
) which includes
all the stuff. We may write our own binary bootloader.. I am waiting for the
result of the new firmware feature requests before we waste time on stuff
bplan is silently fixing.
