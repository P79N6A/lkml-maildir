I tried the multidma mode (as opposed to ultradma), and the system
hanged immediately. (Thanks to the patched-for-netpoll forcedeth
driver), I got the following message:
Unknown interrupt or fault at EIP 00000206 00000060 c0247a3a
There's definitely something wrong here...
I'm still using the same setup as in my first mail.
