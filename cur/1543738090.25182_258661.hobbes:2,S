You are missing the key point that an ioctl is _vastly_ differently from 
a kernel interface, from both a legal and technical perspective.
The userland<->kernel interface is a hard "line in the sand" where we 
don't presuppose you are "linking" (as the GPL defines it)

Hardly.  You're requesting hooks for something that is (a) unreviewed 
and (b) doesn't even exist.  So far as things stand, the need for the 
hooks has not been justified.
Furthermore, it has always been the Linus policy "do what you need, and 
no more."  Adding hooks before they are used violates that credo.

Fundamentally we do not add kernel interfaces for code that isn't in the 
kernel.
Overall, I don't see why it is so damned difficult to delete the hooks 
then add them back when they _are_ needed.  I would certainly support 
you in that effort.
