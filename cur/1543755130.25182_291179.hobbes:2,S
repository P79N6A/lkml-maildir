Hi,
I experience the same problems as reported by Michael Gernoth when 
sending a WOL-packet to computer with a e100 NIC which is already 
powered on.
In my case, it's running kernel 2.6.8.1 and the NIC is identified by 
lspci as:
0000:02:08.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82562EZ 10/100 Ethernet 
Controller (rev 02)
or numerically:
0000:02:08.0 0200: 8086:1050 (rev 02)
The symptoms is that kacpid starts using all the CPU time it can, a 
shutdown takes 5 - 10 minutes after I've done this (in contrast to 20 - 
30 seconds when the machine is healthy).
Also, if I do a "shutdown -h" on the machine after sending a WOL packet 
when it's already powered up, it will shutdown and immediately start up 
again instead of powering off.
So, any suggestions on how to fix it?
Regards,
David
