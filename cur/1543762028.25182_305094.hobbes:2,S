I didn't use your debugging patch, I used something slightly
more sophisticated to simply traces nr_ptes counter bumps
then halt the system when the BUG_ON(mm->nr_ptes) triggered
so I could analyze things.
What happens is (all virtual addresses are PMD_MASK'd):
1) We map 3 PTE tables.
   0x0000000000000000
   0x0000000070000000
   0x00000000ef800000
2) We only unmap one PTE table.
   0x0000000000000000
3) Then we of course BUG() because nr_ptes is 2
I'm now adding more debugging to figure out why only the
first PTE table is being unmapped.
