Hi all,
I have created today's linux-next tree at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git
(tar balls at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/sfr/linux-next/
).
New: I have added a branch called "history" that just stitches all the
linux-next trees together.  I am not sure if this will be useful to
anyone.
You can see which trees have been included by looking in the Next/Trees
file in the source.  There are also quilt-import.log and merge.log files
in the Next directory.  Between each merge, the tree was built with
a ppc64_defconfig for powerpc and an allmodconfig for x86_64.
There were a few merge conflicts (fairly trivial) and one build failure
(reverted and notified).  Below is a summary of the state of the merge.
We are up to 51 trees, more are welcome (even if they are currently
empty).  Thanks to those who have contributed, and to those who haven't,
please do.
In particular, I have very few of the architecture trees ....
Status of my local build tests will be at
http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/linux-next.
  If maintainers want to give
advice about cross compilers/configs that work, we are always open to add
more builds.
Thanks to Jan Dittmer for adding the linux-next tree to his build tests
at 
http://l4x.org/k/
 and the guys at 
http://test.kernel.org/.
