applied to tip/timers/hpet, thanks Janne!
Venki, is this new hpet force-enable quirk entry generally OK:
 DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_HEADER(PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_ICH8_1,
                         ich_force_enable_hpet);
+DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_HEADER(PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_ICH8_4,
+                        ich_force_enable_hpet);
i guess it's OK since we enable hpet on ICH8_1 already. Should we perhaps 
convert these quirks somehow to some ">= threshold_version" condition, 
instead of having to enumerate everything?
