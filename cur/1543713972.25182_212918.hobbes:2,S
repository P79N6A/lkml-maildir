That will not give any benefits. LISP has internal
representation of program and data for sure
('bytecode'), but it is lists. How to unload it to
something one can move around? One of the ways -
unload it in a text form. But it exactly what initial
source code is. Parser of LISP is very small (because
syntax is simple), so producing some non standard
bytecode make no sense - source code of LISP is very
close to it's 'bytecode'.
