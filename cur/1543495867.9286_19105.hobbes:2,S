Hi,
now that some people are posting their wish list for kernel 2.3, I'll send
mine too:
Network: SCSI over IP
BlkDev: LVM, Sharing partitions of blkdevs with other linux boxes
FS: Resizing, Moving, Compression (all online and in background), DEVFS
MM: Dynamic using off free disk space for swapping
Buf-Cache: Buffer head scheduling dependend on priorities of the
           requesting processes and other things.
Perf-Mon: sard-patches
For the fs, blkdev and bufcache part I have more detailed ideas. If
someone is interested I'll post them.
I would help coding all this, but someone must say me what to do how. I
have good C and ASM knowledge, but nearly no knowledge in kernel
programming. Sorry to say, but the documentation isn't the best.
With kind regards
     Torsten Knodt
