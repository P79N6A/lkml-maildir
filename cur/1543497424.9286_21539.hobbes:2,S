For me it's a squid proxy (multithreaded app swapping :), lots of TCP
connections (squid running, or without squid, apache benchmark
accomplished the same run against threaded Roxen Challenger
webserver). Under normal circumstances it did not freeze but when I
forced it to swap a lot (allocated large amounts of memory quickly) it
reproducably froze.
