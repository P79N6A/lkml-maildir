I've found an even easier one...

It's a little shared-object called rpopen.so.  You get it (it comes
w/ a binary), or you can compile it.  I start rvplayer with a 
wrapper script, so i add a LD_PRELOAD=rpopen.so   to that.
The docs says it blocks the app from receiving NONBLOCK when accessing
/dev/dsp.   Doesnt seem to hurt it.  I've been using it since the late
2.1.120's.  Now rvplayer works fine.  This
seems to be the easiest solution...doesnt require any executable
surgery or large downloads.  Even worked with ALSA, when I was trying
that out a few weeks ago.
