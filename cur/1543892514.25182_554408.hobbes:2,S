Subject: [FOR DISCUSSION]: Improve behaviour of spurious IRQ detect
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Currently we handle spurious IRQ activity based upon seeing a lot of
invalid interrupts, and we clear things back on the base of lots of valid
interrupts.
Unfortunately in some cases you get legitimate invalid interrupts caused
by timing asynchronicity between the PCI bus and the APIC bus when
disabling interrupts and pulling other tricks. In this case although the
spurious IRQs are not a problem our unhandled counters didn't clear and
they act as a slow running timebomb. (This is effectively what the serial
port/tty problem that was fixed by clearing counters when registering a
handler showed up)
Its easy enough to add a second parameter - time. This means that if we
see a regular stream of harmless spurious interrupts which are not
harming processing we don't go off and do something stupid like disable
the IRQ after a month of running. OTOH lockups and performance killers
show up a lot more than 10/second
