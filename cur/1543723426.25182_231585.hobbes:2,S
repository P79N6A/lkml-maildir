The "test_and_xxx()" things are memory barriers, but set_bit/clear_bit 
aren't (since ther aren't really supposed to be usable for locking).
It _happens_ to be one on x86, so sadly it works on 99% of the machines 
out there. And to avoid the extra (suprefluous) mb(), there are
	smp_mb__before_clear_bit()
	smp_mb__after_clear_bit()
that only works with "clear_bit()", on the assumption that the way you'd 
do locking is:
	lock:
		while (test_and_set_bit(..)) /* This is a memory barrier */
			while (test_bit(..))
				cpu_relax();
	.. protected region ..
	unlock:
		smp_mb__before_clear_bit();
		clear_bit(..);
but the fact is, the above is broken too, for a totally _unrelated_ 
reason, namely preemption. And then you have the SMP case etc still.
The fact is, you shouldn't use the bitops for locking. You _will_ get it 
wrong. Use a spinlock, and if you _really_ really need just a single bit, 
use
	bit_spin_lock(bitnum,addr)
	..
	bit_spin_unlock(bitnum,addr)
which should get all of this right, and if we ever chaneg the consistency 
rules, we'll make sure the bitlocks still work.
So please..
