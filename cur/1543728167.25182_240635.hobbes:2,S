Okay some new information regarding this problem.  It seems that USB
is not entirely broken, because I can use my USB mouse in X while
using a PS/2 keyboard.
I turned USB and ACPI debugging on in the kernel.  I am recreating
this problem by booting the machine with no USB devices plugged in,
then plugging the keyboard in, and then unplugging the keyboard.  I am
recreating the problem with 2.6.8-rc3-mm1, but any 2.6.8-rc* kernel
seems to reproduce the same errors, and yes I have tried 2.6.8-rc4 as
well.
When I plug the USB keyboard in here is what dmesg shows.

When I unplug the keyboard this is what is shown, and the latter
portion is repeated over and over again.

However, when I plug in my USB mouse and then unplug it, with the same
kernel here is what is shown from dmesg.

I have attached the entire dmesg output from 2.6.8-rc3-mm1 prior to
plugging in any USB devices as well.  If anyone wants to see the dmesg
output from my last working config I can post that as well.
