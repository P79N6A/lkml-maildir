It is in CVS HEAD, but appears not to be in the branches.  It is below.
This should not have a problem with the 16-byte command length, because
kdevname() only returns strings of the form mm:nn, so my system has:
root         8     1  0 08:58 ?        00:00:11 [kjournald-03:07]
root        39     1  0 08:58 ?        00:00:00 [kjournald-03:05]
root        40     1  0 08:58 ?        00:00:00 [kjournald-03:09]
root        41     1  0 08:58 ?        00:00:00 [kjournald-03:0a]
root      1219     1  0 09:23 ?        00:00:02 [kjournald-3a:01]
Which are all within 16 bytes (including NUL), until we get larger
major/minor numbers.
Cheers, Andreas
