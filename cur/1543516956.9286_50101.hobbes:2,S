Hi,
I think new ideas on spin_unlock optimization should go to into 'kernel
hacking' menu as an option with a big warning. If it can improve system
performance it would be VERY usefull for many performance fanatics, and
can be ignored by others. imho ...
(systems which seem to stable with this option would run faster with this,
others can use the old method)
