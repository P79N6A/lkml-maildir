Hi all,

First of all I'm sorry I rubbed some old sores. I didn't know the behaviour was on purpose, and I did google for it. Could have
saved my weekend, had I known.

Routing isn't solving anything here, it's too dynamic. Only one of the devices has a fixed IP, and handles a link to the outside,
among others. The other is on DHCP: addresses can change without warning. Both are on the same ethernet segment.
I've looked at the hidden patch, and it's capable of doing this right. I do think this has to be solved at the device layer. It's
quite counter intuitive the way it is now. My vote goes to hidden.
Regards,
Bas
