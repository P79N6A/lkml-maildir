No, it was just to quicky confirm or deny the fact that it's the kernel
which causes the problem. It could have been a long standing bug in the IDE
or partition code, and which is present in several kernels. But as you say
that it affects two different controllers, there's little chance that it's
caused by anything except linux itself. Then, the reboot on DOS will only
tell you if the drives were corrupted at startup or at shutdown.

I agree, but I proposed it just because it was simple to test.

OK, but the BIOS scans your disks even during warm reboots. Though I don't
think it comes from there because of your two different controllers.
