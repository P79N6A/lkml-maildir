Well, I'm convinced that (b) is unnecessary, as any compiler that notices 
the range thing enough to warn will also be smart enough to just remove 
the test internally.
But yes, as long as the thing is a "review and fix bugs" and not a quest 
to remove warnings which may well be compiler figments, that's obviously 
ok.
