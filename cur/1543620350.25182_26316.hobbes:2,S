Well, i'm going to try this again (and again as long as it takes), but this
time I loaded the .config file from Redhat and am going to take out the
stuff I don't want.  Actually I should have done this from the beginning.
However, I can already see some of the things that I should have enabled
just from looking at their configuration.  I'll keep you posted on the
progress.

Well, not having the proper fs drivers compiled in would not cause the
machine to reboot at that point. The lack of an initrd-2.4.17-10.img file
probably would though.
