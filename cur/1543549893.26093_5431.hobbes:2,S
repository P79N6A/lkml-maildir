I'd call emacs consistently not being able to start an ls on a 16Mb machine
much worse than a surprise...
Hint: Think about how emacs would go about doing that...
Also, to ensure there is /no/ overcommit /anywhere/ amounts to a rigurous
audit of the whole kernel, and of each single patchlet that goes in. You
are certainly welcome to do the job...
