I think there are two ways to analyze the code boundary issue.  One is 
"does it belong in the kernel?"  Another is, "does it belong in the 
filesystem. and if so should name resolution in a filesystem be split 
into two parts, one in kernel, and one in user space."  In ten years I 
might have the knowledge needed to make such a split, but I know for 
sure that I don't know how to do it today without regretting it 
tomorrow, and I don't really have confidence that I will ever be able to 
do it without losing performance.
Glad that BeFS finds the new model better.:)
