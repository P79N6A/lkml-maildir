This is why anything but INLINE or _INLINE (chosen in a Makefile
or header) is broken. Every compiler wants something different
these days. So, as needed, we get one of:
#define INLINE inline /* sanity! */
#define INLINE extern inline /* an oxymoron */
#define INLINE static inline /* another oxymoron */
#define INLINE __forceinline
#define INLINE __attribute__((always_inline))
#define INLINE inline_me_harder
#define INLINE inline_this_or_I_shove_it_up_your_gnu
BTW, I said this during the "extern inline" to "static inline" conversion.
IMHO "extern inline" and "static inline" are oxymorons and, were it
not for the silly C99 standard, ought to produce error messsages.
They make as much sense as "extern static" does. The compiler's
inability to inline something ought to be an error as well. Oh well.
