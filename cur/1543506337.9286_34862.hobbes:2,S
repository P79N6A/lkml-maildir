The PAE36 extensions let you address 64GB of physical memory, but don't
change the fact that you still have a 32-bit user address space: the
user space is still limited to 3GB.

The CPU doesn't support 64 bit pointers.  Kind of makes it a bit
inefficient to access the user memory if you have to make a system call
every time. :)
