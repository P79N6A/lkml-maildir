All that reminds me... The PCI subsystem should probably record any PCI
device's initial configuration state after boot-up and restore those
settings before system reboot. Code like that was already in place
(during 2.2.x cycle IIRC) for Alphas, but got lost somewhen (and was
never added again). Upon reboot, Alphas (with current 2.6.x) running SRM
firmware might crash horribly because of "misconfigured" PCI devices.
