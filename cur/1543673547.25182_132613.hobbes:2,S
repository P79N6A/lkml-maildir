Okay, what's stopping filemap_nopage() from fetching the page from
pagecache after one of the mm->mmap_sem's is dropped but before
truncate_inode_pages() removes the page? The fault path is only locked
out for one mm during one part of the operation. I can see taking
->i_sem in do_no_page() fixing it, but not ->mmap_sem in vmtruncate()
(but of course that's _far_ too heavy-handed to merge at all).
