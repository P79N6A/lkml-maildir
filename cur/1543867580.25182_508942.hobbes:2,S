I don't think we do ourselves any favours by calling people names....
And as I understand it, an important principle in out community is
freedom.  If vj wants to take a particular moral/ethical stance, then
he should be free to do that.  Of course he will have to live with any
consequences, as do we all.
He (or maybe she? I don't know but English is forcing me to use
gender-specific pronouns) or his company sees a business risk in open
sourcing their code.  They now see a legal risk it not doing so.  They
get to choose how to respond.
This list is a great place to seek technical advice on the different
options.   It is not such a good place to get business or legal
advice.
