I make no promises until I"m holding the code in my hand and have tested
it myself. =)  I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work.

Ah, okay.  Jerry Haltom was looking at how to support booting from a
loopback filesystem (for embedded systems shiping a .bin blob) and he
was able to get it running.  This is hopefully just another twist on the
same thing.  I haven't played with FUSE, though, so I don't know what's
needed.
Lemme know if you run into specific problems.  If you have access to
IRC, I'm on freenode as jbailey in #ubuntu-devel.
Tks,
