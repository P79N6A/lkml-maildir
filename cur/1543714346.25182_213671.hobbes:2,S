I'm looking at 2.6.5, and it doesn't define PAGE_COPY_EXEC.  In 2.6.5,
asm-ia64/pgtable.h, PAGE_COPY is executable, and PAGE_READONLY is
non-executable.
Yes I know the naming is different from all the other asm-* files, but
that's what it says.  All of those definitions have confused names on
ia64, although they seem to have the rights bits set in the end.
Has the meaning of PAGE_COPY in asm-ia64/pgtable.h changed in 2.6.5-mm5?
If so, you want to change __P110 as well as __P111.
