Subject: [PATCH 000 of 6] md: Assorted fixes and features for md for 2.6.21
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Following 6 patches are against 2.6.20 and are suitable for 2.6.21.
They are not against -mm because the new plugging makes raid5 not work
and so not testable, and there are a few fairly minor intersections between
these patches and those patches.
There is also a very minor conflict with the hardware-xor patches - one line
of context is different.
Patch 1 should probably go in -stable - the bug could cause data
corruption in a fairly uncommon raid10 configuration, so that one and
this intro are Cc:ed to stable@kernel.org.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
