I could do that, but shoehorning 2.6.9 code into 2.6.8.1 doesn't sound like 
much fun, especially transplanting the whole networking stack...
What I have found are all the IPv6-related patches from 2.6.8.1 to 2.6.9 
(there aren't that many) so I might have a go at patching the kernel with them.

I've got five weeks off to do with as I please. I need something to do, 
otherwise I'm going to go mad :)

Hmm, I've got a source pack for a version of the DG834GT firmware that was 
based on an older kernel (2.4.17) - is IPv6 in 2.4.17 generally considered to 
be quite stable?
If it is, I'll have a go at shoehorning my RC scripts onto the older firmware 
and maybe try and transplant the ADSL line controller firmware too...
Thanks.
