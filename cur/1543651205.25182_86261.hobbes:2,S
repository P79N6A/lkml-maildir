i've run perfectly sane webservers with suid only on /bin/su.  a few
errors are spat out, but things tend to work.  in all honesty i'm yet to
see many other uses for it in a server-admin'd-by-small-group-of-people
situation, except perhaps for sendmail.
al's idea with the mount flags did perk up the old ears though, i would
like to see this done.
