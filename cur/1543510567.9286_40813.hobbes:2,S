I don't know, most likely this is legacy code: perhaps it was written before
down_trylock() was implemented.
I checked the other architectures:
smp_call_function is a "portable" function, but it's only implemented for
i386 and alpha.
alpha: implementation identical to i386, they also use schedule().
it's currently used for:
* i386: MTRR.
* alpha: smp tlb flushing.
I'll replace spinlock and schedule() with a normal semaphore and
down()/down_trylock().
Ingo, could you also fix the UP version of smp_call_function in
<linux/smp.h>?
line 84:
- #define smp_call_function(func,info,retry,wait)
+ #define smp_call_function(func,info,retry,wait)    (func,info,retry,wait,
0)
