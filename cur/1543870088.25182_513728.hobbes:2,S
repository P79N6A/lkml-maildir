I wouldn't bother too much about going into bus specific bits like
irq_request(dev, ...). Well, actually, I _do_ think it's a good thing to
pass the struct device to irq_request but that's a different issue
completely.
I think bus types should provide bus specific helpers to obtain the
struct irq *'s for a given device on that bus, but the API for
requesting/freeing them shall remain generic.
Ben.
