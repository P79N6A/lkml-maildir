There seems to be a problem specific to the 575's wherein the
cardbus layer fails to allocate the PCI IO resources correctly.
I don't have the hardware and I have yet to pin down someone
who has the time/knowledge to poke into the PCI layer to find
out what's going on.
Could you please boot the system with the card inserted, and then
send me the output of `dmesg'?
Thanks.
