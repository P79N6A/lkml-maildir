Is it slow with both scp and NFS?  Or just NFS?
If just NFS then yes, I see this too.  Transferring files 2.5->2.4 over NFS
is several times slower than 2.4->2.4 or 2.5->2.5.  Quite repeatable.

That's a transmit underrun.  The PCI/memory system was not able to feed data
into the NIC fast enough.
Please determine when this started.  2.5.64 would be a good kernel to test
because it doesn't have the PCI changes.
