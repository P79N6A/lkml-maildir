Is there some reason the forwarded patch go lost in the shuffle?  The
problem noted continues through 2.3.28, although in my case it resulted
in an "operation not permitted" message rather than an oops.  Inserting
the noted missing break statement restores functionality.  Here is the
fix rediffed for 2.3.28.  It is against linux/drivers/sound/soundcard.c:

Hi,
as of 2.3.24 there is a "break"-statement missing in drivers/sound/soundcard.c
It causes on Ooops on accessing /dev/sndstat. A patch is attached:
