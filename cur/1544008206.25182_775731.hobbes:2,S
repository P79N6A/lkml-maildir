I saw those error messages with kernel-2.6.27.5-117.fc10.i686 and
xorg-x11-drv-ati-6.9.0-54.fc10.i386 on a HP nx8220. It made
gnome-terminal basically useless, especially with tabs since it took
several seconds to switch tabs.
With the proprietary ATI driver everything works perfectly, including
suspend/resume (yay, successful suspend-to-RAM for the first time
since ACPI!)
