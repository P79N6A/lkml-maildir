Kernel 2.2.0pre4 crashed during compilation of another program and
produced a trace on the screen. Where can I find information on how 
to read the trace?
Unable to handle Kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000027a
current->tss.cr3=03aab00, %cr3-03aab00
*pde=000000
Oops:0000
.....
The process running at that time was
Process crond (pid:73, process nr:16, stackpage=c3ab7000)
Thanks for your help,
-Eva.
