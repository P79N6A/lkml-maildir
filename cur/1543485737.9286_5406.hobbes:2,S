No answer, just additions to the question on MO/CDROM
I would suspect that it is a problem in how the device is reported at
init, the example below show a 'MATSHITA  Model: PD-1 LF-1000'
doing double reporting.  With/out a PD cartridge installed at init it
reports as an "Optical Device"
scsi0 : AdvanSys SCSI 3.1E: ISA 240 CDB: BIOS DC00, IO 110/F, IRQ 11, DMA 6
scsi : 1 host.
  Vendor: SEAGATE   Model: ST43400N          Rev: 1028

Detected scsi removable disk sdc at scsi0, channel 0, id 4, lun 0
scsi : detected 3 SCSI disks total.
SCSI device sda: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 5688447 [2777 MB] [2.8 GB]
SCSI device sdb: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 5688447 [2777 MB] [2.8 GB]

sdc : status = 1, message = 00, host = 0, driver = 28
sdc : extended sense code = 2
sdc : block size assumed to be 512 bytes, disk size 1GB.
Now insert a CDROM disk into the device and........
scsi0 : AdvanSys SCSI 3.1E: ISA 240 CDB: BIOS DC00, IO 110/F, IRQ 11, DMA 6
scsi : 1 host.

scsi : detected 1 SCSI cdrom 2 SCSI disks total.
SCSI device sda: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 5688447 [2777 MB] [2.8 GB]
SCSI device sdb: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 5688447 [2777 MB] [2.8 GB]
This is crazy, but I am not a SCSI person, but have been asked local to
help someone who has these devices.
Would anyone like to explain either one or both of these problems?
