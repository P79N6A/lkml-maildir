The problem with doing that is it would mean reserving some address 
space for mmconfig usage.  If the BIOS doesn't completely describe all 
the reserved regions via e820 or similar (apparently a common problem) 
we may end up making mmconfig overlap with another important area...  
It's pretty hard not to trust the BIOS here without completely 
replacing big chunks of it.
