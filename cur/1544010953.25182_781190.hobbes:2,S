"mmotm" is the "-mm tree of the moment" tree.  The -mm patch pile, updated
usually more than once per day.
Thus far the mmotm tree has been available in `quilt' form, at
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/.
Each time the mmotm tree is re-uploaded an announcement is sent to the
mm-commits@vger.kernel.org list.  (echo subscribe mm-commits | mail
majordomo@vger.kernel.org).
jT <toyj@union.edu> has developed scripts to pull the mmotm tree down
into a git tree (thanks!), available via
	git clone git://git.zen-sources.org/zen/mmotm.git
browseable here:

The patch titles are all screwed up - that's my fault, because the
.patch files don't include the title - I'll fix that sometime. 
This is all very new and I don't know what the update latency is.
