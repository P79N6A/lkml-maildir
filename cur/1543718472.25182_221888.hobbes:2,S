Hi,
Seemingly, I'm having a problem with one of my SATA drives.  It is connected 
via a SII3114 chip (on-board) and worked just fine until a couple of hours 
ago when I tried to scp ~700 MB of data to it.  Then, the process handling 
that request hung in a kernel code (ie. became unkillable with -9) and I got 
this in the log:
May 21 22:26:31 chimera kernel: ata1: DMA timeout, stat 0x61
May 21 22:26:31 chimera kernel: ATA: abnormal status 0xD8 on port

May 21 22:26:31 chimera kernel: Current sdc: sense key Medium Error

0xFFFFFF0000655C87

So, there probably is a hardware problem, but:
1) can you, please, tell me what _exactly_ this means,
2) after it had happened I was unable to do anything with the partition in 
question and I couldn't reboot the machine softly (SysRq+S did not work too) 
so I had to use the red button to get around it (_bad_ thing, IMO).
Well, I would like the kernel to behave more "nicely" in such cases, if 
possible.  In other words, there should be a way to get around a failing 
piece of equipment without rebooting the machine (I know it may be impossible 
but this is not the case, AFAICS).
The kernel is a 2.6.6-mm4 and my box is a dual Opteron.
If you need any more information, just let me know.
Yours,
RJW
