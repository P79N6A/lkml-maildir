i think the native_io_delay() in quirks.c signals the obvious solution: 
a DMI (or otherwise) driven quirk that activates a port 0x80 based delay 
on such boards. Combined with an iodelay=port80 boot option as well 
perhaps, just in case someone hits a system that is not blacklisted yet. 
This way such crazy broken hardware can be mapped correctly - like we 
map such quirks in every other case. Perhaps even do this workaround on 
the PIT driver level. Instead of perpetuating the superstition of port 
80 forever.
