Except that a working prototype of plugsched exists and functions
exactly as advertised.  I understand that modules can be loaded and
unloaded, where as other aspects of the core kernel can't just
load/unload as the kernel is running, but the cpu scheduler could be
selected at boot via a command line, or as a kconfig option when
compiling like the io scheduler.
And while the io team may feel that it would be best to have one
scheduler that worked well under all circumstances, often this can't
simply be the case.  Benchmarks over the years seem to suggest that
different schedulers work different for different situations.  In that
regard, choice does seem to be nice.
CFS is apparently better in its simplicity, however others are
reporting that SD still provides benefits for 3D gaming.  Perhaps
there are instances where even more schedulers like nicksched might be
the most appropriate solution.
