    Hi Miquel :)
> Why not make that INIT=/what/ever, then make this /sbin/init:
    I cannot force the users to do that :(( I think that I could
hardcode the name in the binary. The problem with this is that the
user may move around the binary afterwards...
    I can't find a way to get the on-disk name from the core image
:(( Uff, this is getting way complicated, just for a pretty printing
of the proc titles.
    Thanks for the suggestion, anyway :)) You're great.
