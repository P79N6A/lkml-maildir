Dave,
In scsi we where having issues of insmod / rmmod not cleaning up sysfs
correctly resulting in secondary insmod problems and shutdown oops. 
The problems where:
 - If no probe routine than a device is attach, but error is returned
   allowing more than one attach.
 - Parent always +2 on device_register.
 - driver_unregister lacks full cleanup.
The patch below contains a few workarounds patmans and I have been using
to get our scsi insmod / rmmod plus shutdown working. Mochel has been
offline for a few days so I have not got any feedback from him on the
correctness.  YMMV.
