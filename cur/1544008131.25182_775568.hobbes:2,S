Processing at most SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX pages at once probably
ensures that glitches will be small most of the time.
The only way this could be a big problem is if we end up
racing with the divide-by-two logic in get_scan_ratio,
leaving the rotated pages a factor two higher than they
should be.
Putting all the writes to the stats under the LRU lock
should ensure that never happens.
