Agreed. I only thought this was a problem because you said it should

Works! A 12x burn succeeded with a parallell dd *and* and make -j20.
Overall disk throughput suffered by a couple MB/s but there was a solid
2 MB/s left for the recorder.

Perhaps, but it was a steady downward spiral, and with a read 
throughput far lower than needed I think the application would have
had to cache the entire image in order to survive.

Sounds interesting. It seems that this is the sort of behavior is
precisely what some workloads need and precisely the opposite of
what others need. Such is the life of a vm hacker, I suppose. :/
