Its the only way to have power managment working by 2.6.1. Lots of
work went into pm during 2.5 series, and Patrick invalidated all that
with one, 140KB, untested and broken patch (and he managed to break
about all rules about patch submission). It is not possible to fix
damage he done within week.
