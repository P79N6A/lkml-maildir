Hello all,
I'm using kernel 2.4.19 (SuSE 8.1; k_deflt-2.4.19-174 - actual patch release) on
an IBM xSeries 232 Server. When I'm trying to load the module i2c-piix4, the
module claims, it would be running on an IBM Laptop. This is definitely wrong.
The old SuSE kernel (k_deflt-2.4.19-49) didn't show this problem.
Could you please fix this problem or am I wrong?
Thank you very much,
kind regards,
Andreas Hartmann
