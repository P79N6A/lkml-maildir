A problem has recently been reported on the ARM lists regarding RT signal
handling.  It appears that there is an issue between glibc and the kernel,
in that glibc has a different idea of the layout of structures passed
from the kernel than the kernel itself.
I think this is a case in point that our policy on "userspace must not
include kernel headers" is completely wrong when it comes to user
space interfaces.  I believe we need is a clear set of defined user
space interface headers which contain the definition of structures and
numbers shared between user space and kernel space.  ie, include/abi
or some such.
No, glibckernheaders (or whatever it is) is NOT the solution - that
just creates yet another set of header files to potentially go out
of sync.
Comments?

Sigh.  glibc seems to have a bug.  This is the kernel's idea of ucontext:
struct ucontext {
        unsigned long     uc_flags;
        struct ucontext  *uc_link;
        stack_t           uc_stack;
        struct sigcontext uc_mcontext;
        sigset_t          uc_sigmask;   /* mask last for extensibility */
};
and glibc's idea:
typedef struct ucontext
  {
    unsigned long int uc_flags;
    struct ucontext *uc_link;
    __sigset_t uc_sigmask;
    stack_t uc_stack;
    mcontext_t uc_mcontext;
    long int uc_filler[5];
  } ucontext_t;
God knows where glibc got this from - it hasn't changed certainly since
2.2 kernels.  I suspect glibc has been wrong for some time.
