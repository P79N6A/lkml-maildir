Nice to see that my emails aren't marked as spam :)

So you don't actually have a usb to serial converter?

Heh, patches are always welcome :)
But if you start to use it you will see why it's not really useful.
This is primarily due to the USB core starting up _very_ late in the
boot process, the small size of the buffers of most usb to serial
devices, and the requirement that interrupts be running to send USB
data.  Those three things combined do not make for a good system to try
to capture oops messages.
Good luck,
