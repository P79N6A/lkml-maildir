Various places in lkml discussions. Search for discussions on dynamic
per-cpu allocator. Currently Bharata is adding
cpu hotplug awareness in it, but the basic patches work.
BTW, I am not saying that bigref has what you need. What I am trying
to say is that you should see if something like bigref can
be tweaked to use in your case before implementing a new type of
ref counting wholly in dst code.
Thanks
