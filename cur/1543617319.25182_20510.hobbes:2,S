Also what are the stable series?
But you think your distribution test the kernel in all possible
use? With all possible hardware configuration?
Autoconfiguration will configure a compile and booting kernel.
(but on old machine). Neither vendor can assure you that the kernel
will work for a particolar permutation of hardware, and mainly
it is indipendent from configuration.

Change distribution. In Debian/unstable developers and distribution are
hardly linked!
Why do you need someone in the 'layer' between developers
and user?

Right. Let stop it
