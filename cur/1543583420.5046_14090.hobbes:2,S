Just wondering whether anyone has successfully gotten
either a PCMCIA SmartMedia Adapter (specifically the
Viking Components one) or a FlashPath floppy SmartMedia
adapter working under 2.4.x. I've got both, and haven't
gotten either working under either 2.2.x or 2.4.x, but
I haven't had the time to work real hard at it either,
so I'm hoping someone can give me some pointers...
			TIA,
				tw
