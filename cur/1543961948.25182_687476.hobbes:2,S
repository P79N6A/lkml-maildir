I'm not a frequent poster to this mailing list, but I do spend a good
portion of my life reading it. Please excuse me for expressing my very
personal opinion, but I thought you might probably be interested in a
detached view of the situation.
I think that many have guessed that I would like to talk about the attacks
to Ingo and backwards. Believe me, this fight looks childish, as it becomes
obvious that that went beyond purely technical disputes, which Linus is so
keen of rightfully writing about.
In no case am I implying any kind of offense, but I do believe that bad
emotions do hinder the community from advancing with the technical things.
