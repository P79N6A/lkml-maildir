Ideally, balancing should be completely unaffected when all tasks are
of priority 0 which is what I thought yours did, and why I think the
current system is not great.
I'll probably end up taking a look at it one day, if it doesn't get fixed.
I think your patch is pretty close but I didn't quite look close enough to
