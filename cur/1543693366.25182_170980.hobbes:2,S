The ext3 errors are entirely consistent with disk corruption.  They can
occur in many ways: for example, if the drive is dropping writes due to
the IDE errors, you could easily end up with a corrupt indirect block
that would lead to the above errors if you tried to delete the file
again.
The
	journal_forget_R10d91946() at transaction.c:1259: "!jh->b_committed_data"
error occurs when we try to discard a buffer that has got "committed
data" versioning info attached.  That info is only ever used for bitmap
blocks: it is there to ensure that we don't reallocate freed data until
the transaction that deleted the data has committed (if we crash before
the commit, we need to be able to roll back the delete, so we can't
overwrite the data on disk until after the commit.)
So we're deleting a bitmap block.  No wonder jbd is getting worried.
:-)  But this indicates that it's yet another consequence of the
underlying corruption of an indirect block.
Current 2.4 ext3 includes a patch from Andreas Dilger which detects when
we're attempting to free metadata, and which avoids the free so that we
don't end up reallocating critical metadata as file contents.  I'll have
a look at using that detection to avoid the ext3_forget() on such
blocks.
It's definitely a case that you should never see except on a corrupt
filesystem, so I want to preserve the ability to panic() here for
testing: there's already an ext3 compile-time option you can set in
jbd.h to turn error-detection into assert-failures for errors which can
happen in real life on corrupt filesystems.
