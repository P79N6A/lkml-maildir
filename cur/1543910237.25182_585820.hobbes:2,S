I'm not sure what in that mail you mean, but anyway...
Yes, of course, the fact that "volatile" creates a side effect
prevents certain things from being reordered wrt the atomic_dec();
but the atomic_dec() has a side effect *already* so the volatile
doesn't change anything.

The "asm volatile" implementation does have exactly the same
reordering guarantees as the "volatile cast" thing, if that is
implemented by GCC in the "obvious" way.  Even a "plain" asm()
will do the same.
