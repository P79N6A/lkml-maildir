He is probably talking about configuring the system to support more than
1024 file descriptors per process.
On Linux (POSIX?), fd_set is only 1024 bits long, making select() unusable,
or at least, not portably usable.
Since poll() uses an int to represent the file descriptor, poll() works
in situations that select() does not, although I would suspect that poll()
with this many active file descriptors (assuming one was actually waiting
for an event on 1024+ file descriptors) will probably kill sink quite a few
system seconds into the process over time.
Steve: As Chris mentions, poll(2) is documented. "man poll" will tell you
everything you need to know.
