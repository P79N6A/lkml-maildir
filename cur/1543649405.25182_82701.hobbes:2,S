Yep, like I wrote you yesterday ( and you did not answer ) is that I was
trying to add supprt for AIO into the test HTTP server I use to do
benchmark tests ( 
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/ephttpd-0.1.tar.gz
 )
but since there's no support for AIO POLL, it is impossible ( at least to
my knowledge ) to compare sys_epoll and AIO on a "real HTTP load"
networking test.
