I tried to state and question the position the copyright holders other
than myself, where they stand on the issue of the precedence they are LGPL
as is the module interface and the associated API's
If the position results in being LGPL, initially I will be shipping a
binary only product in order to recover all of my expenses.  I have on the
whiteboard a possible schedule for ERL=0 release date, tied to this
answer.
If the position returns against my ability to recover my investment, I
will change platforms for the product.
