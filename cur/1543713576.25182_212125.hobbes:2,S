When I hit it, I was trying to build a kernel for test purposes, so I
didn't want all the drivers turned on.  I found I couldn't turn off
SCSI and continued anyway turning other things off.  However, USB appears
_after_ SCSI, you can not go through the configuration logically to turn
off features.  Moreover, you do not get any suggestion when attempting
to turn SCSI off that you need to turn off USB.

The x86 default configuration has USB + USB Storage turned on.  It makes
it _non-trivial_ to turn SCSI off unless you have prior knowledge that
you need to turn USB off before hand.

No - the configuration system just doesn't let you turn SCSI off.  No
complaint, no warning, no nothing.  It just won't change the symbol.

Umm, you're talking to an ARM developer who builds some kernels natively.
I suspect that your definition of "slow" is actually faster than my
definition of the same.

Read what I'm saying.  *Silently* preventing options being turned off
with *no* *obvious* *reason* is a pretty major misfeature.
I hope the emphasis will highlight the problem more clearly.
