I tried various other combinations, the most interesting alternative was
8 bits precision. The exponential values would be:
1 / e (5/60) * 256
235.53
1 / e (5/300) * 256
251.76
1 / e (5/900) * 256
254.58
If you would use 236, 252 and 255 the last to load calculations would
get optimized into register shifts during calculation. The precision
would be bad, but I personally don't mind loosing the fraction.
Best regards,
Patrick
