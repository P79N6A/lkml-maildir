OK thanks, I'll look for that.
What is this blacklisting really (besides that it gives bad performance 
for me)?
Does it mean that if I use a kernel which performs well on this hardware 
(i.e. 2.6.8.1, does not seem to have this blacklisting enabled yet) I 
risk data corruption?
And on a kernel in which my hardware is blacklisted, and therefore which 
performs poorly, I don't risk data corruption (at least when it comes to 
transferring data between the drive and the SATA controller)?
