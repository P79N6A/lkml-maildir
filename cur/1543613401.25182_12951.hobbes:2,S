Hi,
  one of VMware users just pointed to me that ECP mode is now broken 
in kernel. 2.4.10-ac9 reports correctly:
0x378: FIFO is 16 bytes
0x378: writeIntrThreshold is 8
0x378: readIntrThreshold is 8
parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778) [PCSPP,TRISTATE,COMPAT,ECP]
parport_pc: Via 686A parallel port: io=0x378
while 2.4.12-ac1 (and all following up to and including 2.4.17-rc1) say just:
parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778) [PCSPP,TRISTATE]
parport_pc: Via 686A parallel port: io=0x378
It looks like a bug to me. Is it known problem, or should I look into
it more deeply?
                                            Thanks,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
