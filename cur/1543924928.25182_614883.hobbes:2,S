What side effects?
Anyway, the refcnt is wrong in rfcomm_release_dev. We could either
remove the rfcomm_dev_del in rfcomm_tty_hangup or remove the
rfcomm_dev_put in the end of rfcomm_release_dev, or the rfcomm_dev
will be destructed, and  the later callback of rfcomm_tty_close could
cause oops.

One is for device deletion (1->0), one is for the get/put pairs,
actually same as before.
Main reason of doing so in this patch is that if I remove the last
rfcomm_dev_put in rfcomm_release_dev, then it looks like get device
<-->  del device, so relace it with set deletion flag and then put
the device like "get device <--> put device" which is straitforward.
