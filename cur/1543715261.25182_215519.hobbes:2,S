Can you share the tests with us? It would be great.

I'm not exactly sure of the problem (others (Andrea, Andrew, etc) probably are). Still,
one useful thing would be to rerun the benchmarks on recent kernels (2.6.6-rc2, which contains a 
lot of VM rewrite and tuning). It will be interesting to know the results.
