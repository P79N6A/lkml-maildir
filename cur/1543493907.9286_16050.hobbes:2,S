Well, I would suspect that you may be having timing problems, as the
K6-2-333 is a 100MHz FSB chip. I would suggest making absolutely sure that
your pci bus is set to run at 33MHz, and no faster. I have seen and fixed
problems with video cards on a 'faster' pci bus where the video memory
wouldn't keep up with the bus speed.
Good Luck
