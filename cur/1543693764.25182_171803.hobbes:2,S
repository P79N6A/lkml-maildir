Note that if you're doing this for high availability purposes, you 
already need to have some way of handling a cpu that just dies in the 
middle of processing.  Once you've done that, you can just re-use that 
to handle hot removal--it just gets treated like a fault.  This is not 
to say that you can't try and shut it down nicely first, but its not a 
hard requirement.
