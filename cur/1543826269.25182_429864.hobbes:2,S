The reason I'm suggesting memtest86, is that it can detect very subtle errors 
(gzip will not do this). The crash you're experiencing is in core kernel 
code, and it is very unlikely to be a real bug.
This is why Con and myself have suggested to reproduce without the binary 
junk, and why bad memory could be a very probable cause.
