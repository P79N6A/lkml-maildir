ACK on all of these. I've been using them internally for a bit in
pursuit of a later problem. Additionally, I am currently reworking the
level->edge->level hack because it's known to be in violation of a
number of errata from third parties. The "legacy mode" hack is actually
only need on certain systems, which have e.g. a PCIe host bridge with
integrated IO-APIC that snoops the APIC to determine mask status.
I'm going to add a blacklist and quirks instead, as doing
level->edge->level otherwise causes us to start losing interrupts on
other systems. I will supply more information later - this is a somewhat
involved problem that we (Red Hat) have been looking at for a while.
Jon.
