i386 in 2.6.2 has the very same security issues. Fixed address for all
binary kernel shipped for the sysenter or int 0x80 instructions.  go
complain who wrote the i386 code.

what are "yours" kernels? You mean mainline or what? I'm saying it's
perfectly fine to relocate the vsyscall page on demand with an
additional syscall but this will have an overhead, like relocating the
.text executable as well will have an overhead, and before you can care
about relocating the vsyscall address, you should relocate the .text of
the executable as Andi noted.

This is fine, the new syscall I'm advocating will simply relocate the
vsyscall page with a new pte and a tlb flush during every context
switch, write it for i386 now since 2.6.2 has those int 0x80 and syscall
instructions at fixed address too.
