kqueue currently does this; a close() on an fd will remove any pending
events from the queues that they are on which correspond to that fd.
I was trying to point out that it isn't as simple as it would seem at
first glance, as you have to consider an issues like this.  Also, if the 
implementation allows multiple event types per fd, (leading to multiple
queued events per fd) there no longer is a 1:1 mapping to something like
'struct file', and performing a list walk doesn't scale very well.
