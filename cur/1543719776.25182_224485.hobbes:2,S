VmallocTotal:   245752 kB
VmallocUsed:    137720 kB
VmallocChunk:   107904 kB
Okay, i see the problem now, the largest piece of memory which could be 
allocated is 107904 kB, right?
Is the 4G/4G split already in the kernel? If yes, which entry activates it?
BTW, CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G is enabled already :-)
Thanks for the hint!
Best regards,
Markus Lidel
