  Hello!
  Several times I had real problems with batch jobs failing with EAGAIN,
printed as "Resource temporarily unavailable". Not with the failure, but to
determine the real cause is really a pain. Usually, the problem is in
resource limits (rlimit, set by ulimit), but the returned error code is
misleading.
  There are two ways. One is to print something to syslog, when some rlimit
is reached. This is already done when limit of open files in system is
reached.
  The second is more subtle - define error code for reaching the rlimit
(possibly one errorcode for each rlimit) and slightly change the code to
return correct error code.
  What do you think about this subject?
