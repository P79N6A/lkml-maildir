Subject: Re: [PATCH][RFC] Make entire ACPI submenu dependent on PM.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch is right, and I applied it.
On i386, it did what it should -- made the menus look better.
Testing x86_64 exposed a latent bug, however.
Since CONFIG_X86_64_ACPI_NUMA=y does a select on ACPI,
it is possible to config a kernel with PM=n
and ACPI=y, which violates ACPI's dependency on PM.
Basically, select of something that has dependencies doesn't
enforce those dependencies.
When will somebody re-write Kconfig into something that
humans can use?
