I have the same problems with any patch|driver in any kernel (2.4 and 2.5). 
I've talked to a technician at SysKonnect and he told me that my linker is 
broken and he also mentioned that Debian is known to have a broken linker (I 
cannot confirm this in any way!)
Sorry, I don't have more info's about that.
