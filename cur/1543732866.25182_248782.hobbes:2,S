Here's my guess at what is happening:
0x59/xx is an artifact of PATA drives being required to transfer bogus
data on an error to satisfy the way the DMA controller was programmed
at the start of the transfer.  Most all drives used this same
technique in PIO modes too, sharing common transfer code in their
firmware.
This behavior, unfortunately, caused a ruckus in SATA ...  At least
one SATA controller immediately starts sending HOLD primitives when
they see the error bit get set.
In PATA, you can asynchronously issue a soft reset or a new command,
to abort the data transfer for the invalid command.  However, in SATA,
once the board starts sending HOLD primitives and the drive responds
with HOLDA, there's no way to transition into X_RDY to send the soft
reset or a new command.  Boom, you're deadlocked.  This means that in
SATA, the only way to overcome this deadlock in the driver is to have
the host/board generate a COMRESET OOB burst to hard-reset the drive.
Today's (and tomorrow's) generation of SATA drives will never ever
generate a 0x59 status... the error and DRQ bits become mutually
exclusive.  However, unfortunately, there are quite a few drives in
the field which have this behavior...
