While Googling around for Hobson's Choice[1], I realized that we are 
presented with the utterly apropos Morton's Fork:

With CONFIG_ENABLE_MUST_CHECK warning explosion, we must choose between 
seeing warnings in our own code, but missing __must_check bugs, and 
seeing all the __must_check bugs but obscuring our own day-to-day devel 
problems.
In the future, I would hope that it would be reasonable to merge a 
feature like this along with the cleanups that avoid a warning explosion.
