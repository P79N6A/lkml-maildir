No, no, I'm not claiming that _you_ are writing the NUL bytes. I'm
claiming the kernel has a bug that triggers with non-page-aligned starting
offsets of writes (because we clear the bytes after "i_size", and we don't
synchronize those clears sufficiently), and concurrent flushes. There's
probably some other trigger needed too (CONFIG_PREEMPT being just the
thing that uncovers the race).

No, the mmap thing was Andrew's theory. My theory is that regular
"write()" calls can trigger it through the "commit_write()" function.
Of course, my theory also depended on a page unlock happening in a place
where it didn't actually happen, so the exact details of my theory are
crap. I'll need to re-think that part.
