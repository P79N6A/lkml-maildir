linux 2.4.20 supports NAPI for tg3 only. I have patches for e1000,
3c59x, tulip, and eepro100 at:
	
http://gtf.org/lunz/linux/net/
The tulip patch might be a bit outdated. The only one of these patches
that I've personally tested extensively is e1000, and it works well
under extremely high interrupt load. e1000 cards are getting cheap
enough to be considered as 100BaseTX NICs, and they perform well doing
that.
Napi patches also exist for dl2k and a few other drivers, but I'm not
sure where.
