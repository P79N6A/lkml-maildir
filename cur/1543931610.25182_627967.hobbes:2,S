This reintroduces the fault vs truncate race window, which must be fixed.
Also, it is adding a fair bit of complexity in an area where we should
instead be reducing it. I think your filesystem should not be doing
writeback caching of dirty data in the cases where it is so problematic
(or at least, disallow mmap and read on the dirty data until it has been
written back or failed).
But otherwise I guess if you really want to discard the dirty data after
a failed writeback attempt, what's wrong with just invalidate_inode_pages2?
