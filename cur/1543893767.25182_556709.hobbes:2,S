Do you have another ideas about that? Only remove it?

From the different view ways, there are different results. Getting the
version from RapidIO IP revision register is clear to me. :)

Ya, caught by you! I'll fix it in next version. :)

There are no rapidio device in it. Doorbell, msg are all parts of
rapidio controller.
For example, 8641 rapidio controller have 2 msg unit: msg0 and msg1.
They are not rapidio devices. Each msg unit has the tx_irq and rx_irq.

Ok, I'll add it in the next version for more religious.
Thanks!
