Hi,
I guess I have encountered an nfs cacheing problem
(kernel = 2.2.2, knfsd system). I have the following
situation - pay attention to the "-L" in ls's args:
/auto/path/subdir1/subdir2> ls -alFL .arg
lrwxrwxrwx   1 schattev gendev         10 Mar  4 16:30 .arg ->
../../.arg
/auto/path/subdir1/subdir2> ls -alFL ../../.arg
-rw-r--r--   1 schattev gendev      16501 Mar  4 16:24 /auto/path/.arg
Interestingly this happens on an automounter
directory. The machine which shows this artefact
is the nfs-server of /auto/path, i.e. it is
just a local file system to that host. There
are ten other hosts (same OS) which really
automount that path and which don't show this
strange behaviour:
/auto/path/subdir1/subdir2> ls -alFL .arg
-rw-r--r--   1 schattev gendev      16501 Mar  4 16:24
/auto/path/subdir1/subdir2/.arg
/auto/path/subdir1/subdir2> ls -alFL ../../.arg
-rw-r--r--   1 schattev gendev      16501 Mar  4 16:24 /auto/path/.arg
Any ideas? Is there anything I could try? Is this
a known problem? Is there a patch available, which
solves this problem?
Thanks,
Ruben
