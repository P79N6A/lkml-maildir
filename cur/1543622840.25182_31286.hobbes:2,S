Could you actually explain what it changes, especially as it isn't
really commented very well..
Despite of the above I already have some nitpicks:
 - couldn't you make inc_nr_active_pages/dec_nr_active_pages/
	inc_nr_inactive_pages/dec_nr_inactive_pages inlines?
   The current macro abuse isn't nice.
 - in mm/memory.c (the 1141 chunk) you introduced a race.

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
