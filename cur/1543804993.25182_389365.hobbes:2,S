Joerg,
You will be happy to know that in future Linux distros, cdrecord will
not require setuid to mlock() and get SCHED_FIFO - both are now
controlled by rlimits, so if the distro ships with a sane PAM/group
configuration, all you will need to do is add cdrecord users to the
"realtime" or "cdrecord" or "audio" group.
This will take a while to make it into distros as it requires changes to
PAM and glibc in addition to the kernel.
