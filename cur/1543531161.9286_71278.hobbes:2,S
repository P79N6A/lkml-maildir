Sg has an additional interface in 2.3 in which the data
direction is specified. The current driver passes that
information through to the mid-level and beyond. What
happens if the app writer gets it wrong or, the data
direction of a vendor specific command changes between
models? The CAM, UDI and ASPI pass-through interfaces
all have a similar data direction flag. Perhaps Gerard
can tell us what happens in FreeBSD (CAM3) if that
flag is incorrectly set?
Crashing the kernel in such circumstances seems a bit 
extreme.

I'm testing out a retrograde patch to do just this on
the original sg_header interface. That should cure the
SANE problem. Hopefully it will be ready tomorrow.
The SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND ioctl() probably needs attention
for the same reasons.

Still trying to track down how that scenario can happen.
Some SANE backends go direct to sg and could set a sg_header
object so data looks like it is flowing both ways irrespective
of whether a command data transfer direction is like a READ, 
WRITE or has no associated data transfer.
