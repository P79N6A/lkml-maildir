fsck can perform journal replay.  It's the same code, in fact.
So even if one does run fsck against an unclean ext3 partition,
fsck will just replay the journal and then exit.  It won't do
the twenty minute go-grab-a-coffee thing unless it has explicitly
been passed the `-f' option.  Doing that is very, very paraniod.
I normally just leave ext3 at the default check-time settings,
so fsck runs every thirtieth boot or so.  ie: hourly :)
