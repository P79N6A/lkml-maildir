Not surprising - I've worried only about changing the TLB architecture on
x86, where the caches do not matter.

I think I'd prefer the "let the tlb functions handle caches too" approach.
For many architectures, that means "tlb_start/end_vma()". Others can do it
in "tlb_remove_tlb_entry()".
There's another issue: I think we should aim to get rid of the old
"flush_tlb_xxxx()" functions, and aim to rely entirely on the TLB
gathering. vmalloc/vfree might be the one special case (and I suspect
vfree() is going to get a lot slower to make sure it does the right thing
wrt TLB's).
