Next to this, there seems to be a mistake in the 2.6.10 changelog: it writes
[quote]
kobject_uevent(const char *signal,
	                 struct kobject *kobj,
	                 struct attribute *attr)
[/quote]
whilst include/linux/kobject_uevent.h defines
[quote]
int kobject_uevent(struct kobject *kobj,
                   enum kobject_action action,
                   struct attribute *attr);
[/quote]
which is something completely different.
