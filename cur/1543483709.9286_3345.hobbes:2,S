I would say ISO 4873 restricts how ISO 2022 should be used, but that a
terminal emulator should probably implement full 2022.
Well, we need to support multiple charsets -- at least different
versions of ISO 8859, as well as KOI-8 and the like -- as soon as
possible.  2022 seems to be the standard of choice, and I think the VT
terminal can easily be adapted to be 2022 compliant.  Actually, I
rather suspect, based on my reading of the VT 220 technical manual,
that VT 220 *is* ISO 2022 (but not ISO 4873) compliant, and that the
divergences is caused by the way Linux extended the charset system.
