Virgin 28 does not have a knee, but grows one when NEWIDLE is enabled.
The throughput curve is essentially the mc=2 curve with the knee
smoothed away, and a higher peak.  The very end is considerably lower.
ie it only helps the extremely contested end, and not nearly as much.
The whole curve is roughly a point under the 26.8 curve (which could
easily be config differences etc, but the shape is right).
I'll rummage around.
