Thanks, Dave, for setting me straight on not posting mondo patches to
lkml. :-)
The 4.0.0.4 version of the driver, with the crypto CRC calls omitted,
has been submitted for review by the scsi maintainers.  Here is link
to a "preview" patch with the calls to the crypto CRC32C module back
in, but without any of their latest comments incorporated:

iscsi-crc.{c,h} are just wrappers for code using the previous private
implementation.  iscsi-recv-pdu.c and iscsi-xmit-pdu.c have the code
which processes scatterlists and make calls to the crypto CRC32C
routines in the other patch.
This code has been tested successfully on 2.6.1 with udev-0.15 and late-model
sysfs, hotplug, and klibc.  The patch also contains the iscsi utilities
code, if you want to go the whole nine yards.

    Minnesota is a very agreeable state.  Lately even Celsius and
                   Fahrenheit have tended to agree.
