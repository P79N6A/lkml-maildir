I know how it is (to some degree), and its wrong. The user sees inside the filename
and sees a string of characters, not a byte sequence.

Ok, I've got the iocharset option wrong, god knows why. The problem 
however remains.
It seems you simply don't want to understand the problem, which is that users 
CAN HAVE DIFFERENT LOCALES on the same system and on different system. 
Sigh...
I less concerned with which solution than that a solution should be found. So it
seems no file system has a solution today. Still an iocharset option would relieve
the problem for removable media and muli-boot systems. Most linux machines
are essentially single user and have either the same locale for all users or all
users are using UTF-8 with their locale. It's not the locale, but the charset used
for encoding the locale. The rest cannot be helped.
