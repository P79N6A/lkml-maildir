hello,
I have found a problem in scsi.c which in present in the 2.2 and 2.4
series. the scsi error handler thread is created with:
kernel_thread((int (*)(void *)) scsi_error_handler,
                                (void *) shpnt, 0);
This will lead to problems, when you have to umount the filesystem on
which the scsi-hostapter module is located.
To solve to problem I would propose to change this to:
kernel_thread((int (*)(void *)) scsi_error_handler,
                      (void *) shpnt, CLONE_FILES);
Bye,
