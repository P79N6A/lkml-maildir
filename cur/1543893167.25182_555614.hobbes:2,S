Once code obtained under the GPLv2 only licence that the kernel is released 
under is modified and submitted back to Linus for inclusion, that code 
would become GPLv2 only - only the original would be BSD/LGPL/GPLv2+ and 
only separate changes to the original could continue to be available under 
dual licence. Since most files will have been modified at various stages 
in Linux's development when major internal changes occur, surely practically 
everything is now GPLv2 only?

If you can contact whoever currently owns the copyright, they can release 
it under another licence... however this is no good because the derivative 
work would be GPLv2 only. Perhaps if you got *everyone* at all stages of 
development (including code that has been removed if existing code is a 
derivative work of it) to agree - then it could work.
It only takes one person's code, uncooperative or not contactable, to 
prevent a change to the licence, so there's not much point in trying 
unless you intend to start replacing such code.

Surely that doesn't work since the entire Linux kernel is (and can only be) 
released as GPLv2? Wouldn't anyone making changes to those files need to 
obtain a copy under the other licence and explicitly release it under both 
licenses in order to maintain that?
