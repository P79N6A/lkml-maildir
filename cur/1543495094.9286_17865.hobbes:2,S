The same thing happens when you forget to unmount nfs mounts. The umount
will time out eventually..

No this is a problem with 'umount -a' called from /etc/rc.d/init.d/halt
(in redhat 5.2)
try to replace 
echo "Unmounting file systems"
umount -a
mount -n -o remount,ro /
with something like:
echo "Unmounting file systems"
for i in ` mount | grep -v 'type smbfs' | awk '{print $3}'  ` ; do
 	umount $i
done
I think smb shares are mounted with type smbfs but i could be wrong ( i
don't use Samba).  if you want to leave nfs mounted too, add a 
grep -v 'type nfs'| after the first grep.
