Well just a plain SCSI bus reset. Here is a sample:
    kernel: scsi0 channel 0 : resetting for second half of retries.
    kernel: SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
    kernel: (scsi0:0:1:0) Synchronous at 40.0 Mbyte/sec, offset 15.
    kernel: (scsi0:0:3:0) Synchronous at 80.0 Mbyte/sec, offset 15.
    kernel: scsi0 channel 0 : resetting for second half of retries.
    kernel: SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
    kernel: (scsi0:0:1:0) Synchronous at 40.0 Mbyte/sec, offset 15.
    kernel: (scsi0:0:3:0) Synchronous at 80.0 Mbyte/sec, offset 15.
    kernel: sr1: CDROM not ready yet.
    last message repeated 3 times
    kernel: scsi0 channel 0 : resetting for second half of retries.
    kernel: SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
    kernel: (scsi0:0:1:0) Synchronous at 40.0 Mbyte/sec, offset 15.
    kernel: sr1: CDROM not ready yet.
I also tried reverting to the old aic78xx from 2.2.16 (aic 5.1.28) but
it did not help (2.2.17pre* contains aic 5.1.31).
The wierd thing is that so far, only quake and quake2 have trouble
playing CDs (with the uniform cd-rom driver 3.11). All other programs
have no trouble at all.
