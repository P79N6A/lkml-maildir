2.4.5-ac4 was fine, 2.4.5-ac5:
/space in /etc/fstab:

strace umount /space1:

munmap(0x40021000, 4096)                = 0
oldumount("/space1"
and there it hangs. The kernel doesn't hang, but while 'mount' displays
/space1 as mounted, ls /space1/ says nothing. df -m reveals:
Filesystem           1M-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda10                2015       907      1005  48% /space1
Good luck,
Jurriaan
