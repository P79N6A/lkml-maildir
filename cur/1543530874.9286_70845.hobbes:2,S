david, helge,
that sysctl does *not* turn off overcommit.
it does the opposite, it turns off bounds checking of memory allocs
completely. Read the docs for it properly.
Anyone reading this thread contemplating enabling that sysctl - think

that sysctl to > 0 unless you know exactly why you need it.
