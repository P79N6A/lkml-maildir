[NOT SUBSCRIBED ]Pls. CC me to all replies.
Using 2.4.21-rc3 - The kernel hangs in the process of booting, (No response to anything - including alt+sysrq) right after starting the PCMCIA service.
Distro is RH 8.0 and I have CompactModem card in socket 1 -
Cardctl ident reports this about the card:
Socket 1:
  product info: "PRETEC", "CompactModem 3.3V 56K", "021", "A"
  manfid: 0x0013, 0x0000
  function: 2 (serial)
The hang is reproducible - always.
Booting with RH kernel 2.4.20-21 doesn't show this problem.
Looking at drivers/char/pcmcia there seem to be good amount of
differences between plain 2.4.20 and 2.4.21-rc3 serial_cs.c.
If I go back to serial_cs.c (v1.128) from 2.4.20 and compile it with 2.4.21-rc3, the hang is no longer reproducible. (BTW, serial_cs.c is compiled as a module)
Will try to narrow down to the change which actually causes the hang in
2.4.21-rc3, so it can atleast be rolled back or better - fixed in 2.4.21.
