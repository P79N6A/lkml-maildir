Per tty instance this is true, but this is not the case for multiple
userland::write() calls.

Yes this does seem to be true.  However, it can throw a driver into a
wierd state if this happens.  Ideally the driver should be able to
recover.  I'm not sure if we can guarantee that user_land protocol could
recover though, especially if write()s aren't guaranteed to complete
successfully.

I guess my biggest concern here is the definition of the
tty_driver::write() interface.  Should a driver be able to rely on the
schedule() call to complete its write?  It seems that since the driver
is responsible for waking up the tty->write_wait, it should be able to
rely on the schedule() call.  However in this implementation it cannot
which I'm sure is for performance reasons.  Because of this, I don't
think the USB layer should be interacting with the tty layer in this
fashion.
So for this implementation of write_chan(), the tty_driver::write()
interface should note that the driver needs only to wakeup the
tty->write_wait iff it does not write all of the requested data in this
call.  Is this a fair assessment and can this be depended on for future
implementations?
Anyway, part of this discussion needs to happen on the USB mailing list
since the usb-skeleton driver outlines this method of interacting with
the tty layer.  Given the current implementation I don't think the
usb-skeleton is correct.
Thanks for your help.
