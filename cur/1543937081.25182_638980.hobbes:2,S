probably doesn't matter, but for the record:
Tested-by: dean gaudet <dean@arctic.org>
this time i tested with internal and external bitmaps and it survived 8h 
and 14h resp. under the parallel tar workload i used to reproduce the 
hang.
btw this should probably be a candidate for 2.6.22 and .23 stable.
thanks
