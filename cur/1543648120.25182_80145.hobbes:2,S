I don't recall any.  (I suppose I should get off my butt and start
running 2.5.)

The overhead is probably mostly linear with activity, I don't know.

Seems like the thing to do is to move /dev/epoll over to use
Ben's event system rather than worry about the old /dev/epoll interface.
But like signal-per-fd, we will want to collapse readiness events,
which is something Ben's event system might not do naturally.
(I wouldn't know -- I haven't actually looked at Ben's code.)
