For user space to manipulate scheduling domains, pinning processes
to some cpu groups etc, that kind of information is very useful!
Without this, users have no notion about how far between two nodes.
But ACPI SLIT table is too arch specific (ia64 and x86 only) and
user-visible logical number and ACPI proximity domain number is
not always identical.
Why not export node_distance() under sysfs?
I like (1).
(1) obey one-value-per-file sysfs principle
% cat /sys/devices/system/node/node0/distance0
10
% cat /sys/devices/system/node/node0/distance1
66
(2) one distance for each line
% cat /sys/devices/system/node/node0/distance
0:10
1:66
2:46
3:66
(3) all distances in one line like /proc/<PID>/stat
% cat /sys/devices/system/node/node0/distance
10 66 46 66
