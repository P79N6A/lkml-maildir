Alan, Russell is talking about CardBus controllers (it's also PCMCIA, in
fact, these days it's the _only_ pcmcia in any machine made less than five
years ago).
The patches to get i82365 and TCIC up and running again are interesting
mainly for laptops with i486 CPUs and for desktops with pcmcia add-in
cards (which are basically always ISA i82365-clones). They aren't
interesting to ARM, I suspect.
