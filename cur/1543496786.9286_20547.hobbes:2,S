Ok, see the "All I saw was..." part?  That was a reference to
linuxhq.org, and what I saw there was what followed the "All I saw..."
part.  So yes, we all understand that the original message was about
linuxhq.org.  The point is, we didn't see any vulgarity at linuxhq.org,
but what we *did* see was the reference to linuxhq.com that I made
above.
Someone just trying to stir up trouble, probably, with rumors...
