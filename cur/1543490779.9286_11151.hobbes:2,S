Ok. I did what you suggested. Did not work. My log on bootup says:
VP_IDE: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0x6000-0x6007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
ide0: VIA Bus-Master (U)DMA Timing Config Success
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0x6008-0x600f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
ide1: VIA Bus-Master (U)DMA Timing Config Success
hda: Maxtor 87000D8, ATA DISK drive
hdb: probing with STATUS(0x00) instead of ALTSTATUS(0x50)
hdb: probing with STATUS(0x00) instead of ALTSTATUS(0x50)
hdc: Memorex CRW-1622, ATAPI CDROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
hda: Maxtor 87000D8, 6679MB w/256kB Cache, CHS=851/255/63
thus idedma is not enabled on bootup. I enable it later with
hdparm -m16 -d1 -u1 -c3 -W1 -k1 -K1 /dev/hda
but do not do anything for /dev/hdc which is on a different controller.
Even if this would be a problem then the ide driver would reset and
disable DMA and thus the next attempt should work. It aint.

Correct. Neither under 2.2.4

Never tried DMA with CDRW

It does not.
