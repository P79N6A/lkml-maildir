Erm, crossed wire :-)
I do it for inheritance in the same way as, say, Xlib with X events.
That's perfectly safe and commonplace.
I didn't understand Albert's reason for prohibiting the mere cast.
(Notions of old machines where the char * representation is different
from int * came to mind, but Linux doesn't run on those... does it?)
Oliver Neukum explained that you shouldn't dereference a pointer to a
larger type because of alignment issues on some machines.
sizeof(foo)<sizeof(bar) captures this rule just fine for the basic data
types (char, int etc.).
But for structures, it's actually possible to have a smaller type with a
larger alignment requirement, and vice versa:
     struct small { double x; };
     struct large { char y [11]; };
Also, it is certainly permitted to cast "char *" to "int *" if you know
that the underlying object is an "int" or something compatible with one.
So, the general rule `don't cast from "foo *" to "bar *" if
sizeof(foo)<sizeof(bar)' is wrong, and is routinely not followed.
An alternative rule might be `never dereference a "bar *" if it might
not have the correct alignment for "bar" on any platform'.
