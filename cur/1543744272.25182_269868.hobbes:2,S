The contract might have a termination clause triggered if you do a
handstand or file a patent lawsuit against Sveasoft.  By your
argument, that would make the contract breach the GPL, since you could
not use the GPLed software while doing those things -- which is
ridiculous on its face.

That depends greatly on the wording of the contract.
Interestingly, the only description I can find on Sveasoft's web page
says this:
    Sveasoft firmware and support is available for a yearly $20 USD
    subscription fee. A subscription includes unlimited access to
    firmware upgrades and unlimited access to priority support.
If Sveasoft terminates someone's "unlimited" access before the year
expires, Sveasoft may be in breach of contract, since there are no
disclaimers about termination -- but that still does not translate to
copyright infringement.

I suspect that an activation key would violate the GPL, but that is a
different question than the support contract.
