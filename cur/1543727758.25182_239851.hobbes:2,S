Don't even bother.
Joerg is wrong. SCSI number simply doesn't work, and the current Linux 
setup is absolutely the right thing to do.
If Joerg keeps breaking cdrecord, the distributions will hopefully just 
keep unbreaking it. The way you send SCSI commands to a device under Linux 
is to open the device (with O_NDELAY) and then just start sending the 
commands. None of the idiotic scanning and SCSI numbering crap.
Involving Joerg in it just makes you go crazy. Don't bother.
