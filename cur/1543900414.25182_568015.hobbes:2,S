There are ways to query devices (think of hdparm -I in S-ATA/P-ATA drives, SCSI 
has similar queries) to see what kind of device you are talking to. I am not 
sure it is worth the trouble to do any automatic detection/handling of this.
In this specific case, it is more a case of when you attach a high end (or 
mid-tier) device to a server, you should configure it without barriers for its 
exported LUNs.
