Could you put the relevant code into an asm/ file for 2.6 then please?
Background: x86-64 shares the PCI code with i386 which just works
for both 32bit and 64bit currently. If it is all changeable in the asm/ 
file then I won't need to change it later again. Of course the fixmap
would work for x86-64 too, but just mapping the 256MB is much nicer
and preferable.
