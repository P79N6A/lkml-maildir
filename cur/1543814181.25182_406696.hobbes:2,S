Heh, indeed that's why I asked.  per-cpu buffer means ROM state knows
which vcpu is current.  How is this done in OS agnostic method w/out
trapping to hypervisor?  Some shared data that ROM and VMM know about,
and VMM updates as it schedules each vcpu?

I agree with your final assessment, needs more threshing out.  It does
feel a bit overkill at first blush.  I worry about these semantic
changes as an annotation instead of explicit API update.  But I guess
we still have more work on finding the right actual interface, not just
the possible ways to annotate the calls.
