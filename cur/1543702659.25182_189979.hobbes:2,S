Uhm, AFIAK, you should _NOT_ install the drivers from the lm-sensors
package, but use those in the kernel.  Check the docs, they explicitly
say that you should only do:
  # make user user_install
if you have 2.6 kernel.  Further, you do not _need_ lm-sensors package,
as if you only want to check/monitor one setting, you can get it from
/sys, and if you use gkrellm, it do not even use libsensors anymore
(and thus works without, as it have since 2.6 support, before even
libsensors was ported to understand sysfs) ...
