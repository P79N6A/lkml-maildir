Most likely the problem is above.net has customers who can't
upgrade to a newer mailer that can block relaying.  MVS systems
running OS/390 1.3 and older (perhaps even newer OS/390) have this
problem.  So, getting listed in ORBs pretty much causes spammers to
abuse these MVS systems.  The only way we fould out of the problem
was to remove network mail from MVS.  IBM wanted us to upgrade
OS/390, but we were busy with Y2K stuff.  I'm sure similar problems
exist with other OSes.  Yeah, I know, that's what happens when you
don't use open source...
