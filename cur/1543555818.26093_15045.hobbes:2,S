The loader is insmod, which does all its own reloaction and loading.
The problem is that ancillary tools like ksymoops, gdb, kdb and
possibly others do not expect sections to be discarded after load.
Adding the feature to insmod is fairly easy, fixing the ancillary tools
to understand that some sections are discarded after load is a bit
harder.  Debugging is particularly messy, when an oops occurs how do we
tell if the __init data been discarded yet or not?
I have added this to my investigation list for modutils, ksymoops and
kdb 2.5, no promises.
