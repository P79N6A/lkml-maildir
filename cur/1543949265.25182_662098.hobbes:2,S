Actually Paul, you don't need to make this an "option". Simply the default
if PREEMPT_RCU is not selected. In otherwords, no prompt.
	config CLASSIC_RCU
	  bool
	  depends on !PREEMPT_RCU
	  default y
Then, have the PREEMPT_RCU defined down below (as you already did), and
have it be the only option. That is, you can have normal RCU or select
to have PREEMPT_RCU.
If the user selects PREEMPT_RCU, CLASSIC_RCU will be unselected.
