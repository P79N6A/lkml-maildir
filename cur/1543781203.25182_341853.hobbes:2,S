    That's not possible. sd_mod will assign different devices for
different USB gadgets, and that's my problem in the first case!. If I
plug my USB-whatever, it gets assigned /dev/sda1 (for the first
partition, I mean). If I unplug it and, after that, I plug any other
USB device, it gets assigned /dev/sdb1, etc. Don't know if the
culprit is usb-storage or sd_mod :? The problem is that I cannot know
about which device was assigned (at least in 2.4.x) so I can modify
fstab or even mount it.
