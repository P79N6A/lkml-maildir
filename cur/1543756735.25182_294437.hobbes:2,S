i'm wondering what the best approach would be. Right now if
DIRECT_PREEMPT is enabled [it's disabled currently] and a higher-prio
task has been woken up we switch to it without ever enabling interrupts
again. Re-enabling interrupts during schedule() will reduce irq
latencies but will lengthen critical sections.
