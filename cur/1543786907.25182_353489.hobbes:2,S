OTOH, write_seqlock is probably more heavier compared to read_seqlock. So 
I am OK if we want to call 'reprogram' w/o any xtime_lock held and that
routine internally uses a read_seqlock if it wants.
Let me know what you guys think about this and the rest of the interface.
If it seems Ok, I can post modified i386 patch based on this interface and
would request Martin/Tony to do the S390/ARM ports.
