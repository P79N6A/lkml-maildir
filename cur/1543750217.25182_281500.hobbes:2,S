It is the following code snippet that causes the troubles:
---
outputmakefile:
        $(Q)if /usr/bin/env test ! $(srctree) -ef $(objtree); then \
        $(CONFIG_SHELL) $(srctree)/scripts/mkmakefile
---
I've now tried differents way to reproduce the error without luck.
You are the second person reporting this - and I assumed from fitst
poster this was a symlink issue. But I cannot reporduce it here.
One person coul not locate /usr/bin/env - but that did not trigger
anythin renaming that file to something else.
Could you please drop a mail with full log what you do before seeing
this bug.
