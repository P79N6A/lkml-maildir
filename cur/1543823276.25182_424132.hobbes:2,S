Thankyou :-)  I found our debate very valuable - it helped me clarify
my understanding of some areas of linux filesystem semantics (and as I
am trying to write a filesystem in my 'spare time', that will turn out
to be very useful).  It also revealed some problems in the code!

I thought it was our job to kill the bugs *before* they were
demonstrated :-)
I'm still convinced that the previous code could lead to deadlocks or
worse under sufficiently sustained high memory pressure and fs
activity.
I'll send a patch shortly that fixes the known problems and
awkwardnesses in the new code.
Thanks again,
