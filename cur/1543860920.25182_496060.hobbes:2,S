Yes, that's correct.
Good to know that. What did the output reveal ?
It can be extended by pid/futex for userspace app that has yet to be done.
It might require changes to glibc or a some kind of dynamic tracing to
communicate to kernel space information about that lock. There are other
kernel uses as well. It's just a basic mechanisms for a variety of uses.
This patch has some LTT and Dtrace-isms to it.
What's your intended use again summarized ? futex contention ? I'll read
the first posting again.

It would add quite a bit more overhead, but it could be done with lockdep
directly I believe in conjunction with this patch. However, it should be
specific enough though that a kernel code examination at the key points
of all users of the lock would show where the problem places are as well
as users.
