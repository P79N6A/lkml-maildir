I think we may actually agree, but I may be wrong.
I have no problem with a governor setting the frequency and voltage
based on idle or temperature measurements only it can see efficiently.
But I think you still want more complex things to be decided in userland
which is more forgiving to programmer error. For instance this patch
does not allow you to tailor the polling frequency, if someone wrote a
such a governor that took battery into account my Vaio FXA53 would come
to a grinding halt as checking the battery through ACPI stops the
machine cold for about 200 ms. There is no need to poll the battery very
often, but someone with a fast battery check might do so simply out of
convenience.

]Wrong again. CPUfreq has been rearchitectured to do this kernel-space.
]The userspace governor allows setting to specific frequencies by the user
]["I _want_ 500 MHz and nothing else!"], and it offers backwards
]compatibility for the first-era cpufreq interface [LART project etc.].
No, you can set a min and max frequency that the governor is allowed to
move within. This can be done by a userspace program through the /sys
interface. You can also use the "userspace" governor, but that's not
what I'm recommending.

Sure, a governor that does goes to the minimum frequency it's userland
governor has told it it has available to cool the CPU is a good thing.
Or, even below that if the CPU is near critical. If the CPU gets that
hot there is something wrong with the userland policy. Until this is
written, ACPI can act as a backup system to keep the CPU from burning
up.

]Yes indeed. She wants to set a cpufreq policy which suits of her needs:

Why not a sensible governor in the kernel and a userland governor that
sets the minimum and maximum for desired effect?
]_I_ wouldn't want to run this governor, though -- I want kernel compiles to
]complete as fast as possible. So, we need different in-kernel governors.
I think a governor could keep the CPU running at 100% for long enough to
finish a kernel compile while still slowing down for a really long
compile like KDE, Mozilla, etc. It might however be too complex for me
to feel comfortable with it in the kernel.
]Well, the thing one of the cpufreq userspace programs does is really fine:
]based on low-frequency events [power plug-in, running specific programs,
]etc.] different cpufreq policies [see above] are selected. No XML file
]necessary.
Yes, the userspace program can just switch from performance, to
something in between w/min/max, to powersave. My arguement is just
against making the "something in between" too complex, by for
instance taking the low-frequency events into account.
