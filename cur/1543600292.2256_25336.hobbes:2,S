There are definitely some that have this SE-Termination jumper.

Usually when a single device in a LVD chain is operated in SE mode all LVD
devices also switch to SE mode automatically. The use of a SE terminator
such as the one on your harddisk qualifies for SE operation.
But in SE mode you are tied to the much stricter specifications like length
of cable etc. compared to LVD mode. 
So maybe you just exceeded specifications too much.
Bye,
Thorsten
