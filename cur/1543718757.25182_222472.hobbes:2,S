You could try running your program with 'strace -T' to see which system
calls are causing the slowdown.
If you make a lot of system calls, this can be a little tedious to go
thru though...  But it should reveal to you where your program is
waiting.
Note; if you use gprof and compile with the '-pg' switch, the profiler
will show you a profile of CPU time, not wall-clock time.  Your
performance problem is wall-clock time, and if your program actually
spends a lot of time waiting in some system call, this will *NOT* show
up in a normal gprof profile.
