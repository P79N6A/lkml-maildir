I think in case of BIOS-88 it now sees 1 Meg less than should. int 15, ah=88
gives the amount of extended memory above 1 Meg and it gets copied to
EXT_MEM_K. So HIGH_MEMORY should not be subtracted from it. (On the other
hand in case of BIOS-e801 ALT_MEM_K includes lower memory. I guess the
direct comparison of memory sizes ALT_MEM_K and EXT_MEM_K is not ok.)
