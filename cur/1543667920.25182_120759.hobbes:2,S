That code still has a bigger problem and has to be changed anyway.
If there is a good reason against typeof, I will do it differently
for the final version. This change only kept the hack working
with gcc-3.3, I just forgot to do it right before Martin submitted
it.

No, you are right. I'll change it.

Erm, no:
$ find -name \*.c | xargs grep '\<__GFP_DMA' | wc -l
      9
$ find -name \*.c | xargs grep '\<GFP_DMA'  | wc -l
    183
How about changing the few users of __GFP_DMA to GFP_DMA instead?
