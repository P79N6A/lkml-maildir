I played with e2compr back in the 2.0.30 - .33 days. It seems(seemed?)
to be pretty stable, albeit slower. You should also be aware that if
you try to read an e2compr'd disk/harddisk on a box without an e2compr'd
kernel, everything will work ok, but your data will be corrupted, since
it never gets decompressed.
It's also a very, very bad idea to run e2compr on an older drive, or a
drive with bad blocks, since if the drive starts going bad, you lose
more data than on an uncompressed drive.
