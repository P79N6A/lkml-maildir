Yes, CSB5/CSB6 does not have this problem. I have been using this with the
GC-LE chipset. 
However, there was something that I noticed when I was experimenting with
the FreeBSD kernel for producing these corruptions. I could not reproduce
these corruptions with FreeBSD 4.6 and at UDMA 2. I also noticed that the
PCI config space settings for the IDE controller were different in FreeBSD
and Linux 2.4.17.

Known. The newer kernels will panic in this case to avoid corrupting,
and the 2.4.20-ac/2.5.4x kernels will not use UDMA for disks on OSB4.
The newer serverworks (CSB5/CSB6) doesn't have this problem btw
