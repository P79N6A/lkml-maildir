Oh fun, more work. :)
I can't figure out which specific patch you mean by "per-cpu hot and cold page 
lists" (there's a half-dozen candidates, closest seems to be adding a tag to 
pagevec, maybe I just missed it?)  And since there doesn't seem to be any API 
change, this might possibly be able to go into the stable series?  (Does it 
break other stuff?)
People keep telling me zerocopy NFS is already in, you've got it in the ready 
state...
I think a proper explanation of the chances of the digital video project 
getting in from a standing start at this late date involve snowballs and 
theology, but you never know, and it's not my call... :)
