You need to make the GPL components available to customers, and anything
derived from it. Thats all. That means if you've written additional
programs that make your system work (even shell scripts!) then you could
in theory choose to keep those proprietary until you see 100 copies.
Lots of people ship both free software and proprietary software to make
a product. Richard Stallman always asks people to keep the two clearly
seperated so that someone can easily figure out which bit is which
Also your duties end with giving your customers the GPL source, they
don't extend to helping with it, supporting it or third parties.
