Ok, that _should_ mean that plain -rc6 should work fine for you, if you do
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space 
and it would be good to validate that. But it still leaves the question of 
exactly _why_ that stack randomization matters for you.. Very strange.
Arjan, Ingo, any ideas? The code looks "Obviously Correct(tm)", but maybe 
there's something missing. Does it get the rlimit case wrong? 
Bongani, what does a simple
	cat /proc/self/maps
say for you with randomization enabled? Is there something mapped close to
the stack segment..
(It would be even better to see that for one of the processes that tends 
to core-dump, like "cc1", but that would require you to catch it, probably 
by doign ^Z at just the right time)
