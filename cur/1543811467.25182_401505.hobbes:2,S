it generally feels really fragile, especially with the task enumeration
going to RCU soon. (eg you'd lose the ability to lock out new task
creation)
On first sight it looks a lot better to allocate these things on demand,
but I'm not sure how the sleeping-allocation would interact with the
places it'd need to be called...
