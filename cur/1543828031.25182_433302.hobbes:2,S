Sounds like you're on the right track, but I don't know whether we can
truly be happy making the performance/guarantee trade-off decision for
the user.
You could grossly put the solutions into several camps;
1. solutions which have very low impact and provide soft assurances only
2. solutions which provide hard limits
3. solutions which provide guarantees
I think it's almost invariant that the latter solutions have more of a
performance impact, and that it's quite important that normal system
throughput does not suffer from the "scheduling namespace" solution that
we come up with.

The VServer scheduler is also timeslice scaling - it just uses the token
bucket to know how much to scale the timeslices. It doesn't care about
interactive bonuses, although it does lessen the interactivity bonus a
notch or two (to -5..+5).
This means that it's performance neutral in the general case.

It fits into category 1 (or, using Herbert Poetzl's enhancements, 2), so
does not provide guarantees.

Doesn't deal with huge numbers of processes; but with task group ulimits
that problem goes away in practice.
