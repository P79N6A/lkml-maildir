First of all, I think this patch fixes a bug.
What we are doing in autofs_fill_super()->parse_options() path
is find_get_pid(task_pgrp_vnr(current)), this is wrong.
task_pgrp_vnr() reporst the pid_t in the global namespace, but
find_get_pid() searches "struct pid" in the current namespace.
We can get the wrong pid. I tried to document this in changelog.
Another reason is that task_pgrp_nr() is deprecated. We are wasting
2 words in signal_struct without good reason. Please look at

see above.

Ah, sorry. I forgot to mention this patch is only compile tested
(like the next one, but at least it has the note in changelog).
But again, I think this is bugfix.
