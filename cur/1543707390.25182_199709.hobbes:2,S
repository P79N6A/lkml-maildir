I also saw these with GNOME until the battery status applet was fixed.
See 
http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129167
 for the relevant
fix for battstat. Maybe this fix shows a similar fix is possible under
KDE? Not sure this is a fix really, but at least the symptoms went away
for me after this got fixed.
Cheers
