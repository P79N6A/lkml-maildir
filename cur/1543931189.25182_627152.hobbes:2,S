Whilst on the subject, why wasn't /sys/slab done in debugfs ?
The one-value-per-file thing has gone taken to ridiculous extremes there.
Having 3641 sysfs files that most people never use permanently taking up
memory seems to be a massive waste of resources.
Nearly a third of all the sysfs files I have on my system belong to that
subtree, which is just.. wow.
