Hi,
Am a new bee to linux internals.
I am trying to make a simple program witch will call a function from a 
module. I made a module compiled it and INSMOD-it into kernel, that works 
fine. I would like to call from my user program a function defined in my 
kernel module.
Please suggest any method thro' which this could be accomplished.
The only way i did it was by running my new module as insmod mymodule.o and 
get my job done.
Thanks,
Sudharsan.
