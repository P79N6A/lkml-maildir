hmm, cancel_rearming_ does del_timer() before try_to_grab_pending().

I thought about adding such a parameter, and I don't like this. This is
a matter of taste, of course, but _imho_ this uglifies the code.
In any case, unless we do completely different patch, the sequence should be
	del_timer()	- a pending timer is the most common case
	test_and_set_bit(WORK_STRUCT_PENDING) - the work is idle
	try-to-steal-the-queued-work
This is what we are doing now.

No, we should return 0. This can happen if the queueing of the freshly-
initialized @dwork is in progress.
NOTE: right now try_to_grab_pending() is called from cancel_xxx() only, so
this can't happen (it would be meaningless to do cancel_xxx if somebody else
can queue this work or start the timer), but I'd like try_to_grab_pending()
to be as generic as possible.
So, we should either return 0, or add BUG_ON(!cwq).

see above. Note that wait_on_work() checks cwq == NULL as well. This is
because I do not want to tie try_to_grab_pending() and wait_on_work(),
they should be generic, and could be used independently.

We should optimize the common case, and most probably this work is
already queued, so I don't this it is worth to enlarge .text.

As I said, I personally don't like this, mostly because this complicates
the code a bit more.

Yes, please, and thank you very much for review!
