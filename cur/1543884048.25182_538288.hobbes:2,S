Okay, this makes me see the problem more clearly.  It looks like that
vt/console layer is unreliable in terms of checking for the
text/graphics mode of the current console.  Instead of auditing the
console code, I'll just have vgacon check for the mode.  Try the
attached patch and let me know if it helps.
