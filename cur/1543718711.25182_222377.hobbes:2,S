   I was hoping for something that would shed some light on _why_ this 
happens on my (debian) system. The fact that it doesn't happen on your 
systems that happen to be non-debian doesn't mean much... because I 
don't see anything debian specific in debian package (which is the same 
thing debian maintainer wrote, see link below).

   the udev is started (before the modules are loaded and certainly 
before the attempt to fsck), how's that different from any other system? 
what 'handling' are you talking about?
here are relevant startup scripts in /etc/rcS.d on my machine:
S04udev -> ../init.d/udev
S20modutils -> ../init.d/modutils
S30checkfs.sh -> ../init.d/checkfs.sh

   said to whom? not to me, he responded to my previous email saying 
that he cannot see how it would be debian specific issue and that it 
makes no sense to open debian bug report, see previous emails in this 
thread, here' random google URL for his post:

   it looks like the problem is that after the modprobe is done the 
device is still not available. that _seems_ like a serious problem of 
udev. Maybe I am missing something but after the modprobe is done and 
reports success the device should be available, ortherwise the programs 
have no way to find out what's going on. Adding random sleeps (for how 
long?) doesn't seem like a solution.
