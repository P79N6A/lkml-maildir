It is also likely that in order to get them right you will have to play around
a bit with PIO modes and turning of DMA. Otherwise on some disks the results
may not be reproducible (I had that problem repeatedly with Fujitsu going

In btw run badblocks in non-destructive mode at least a few times and see if
the block do not "float". This may also happen on some ide drives
