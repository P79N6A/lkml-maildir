Your patch does "if there's been no disk activity then avoid syncing old
buffers". Unfortunately that breaks the only thing that kupdate has to do
and the only reason we have a [k]update (userspace or kernel) daemon.
kupdate only cares about the dirty buffers in the system and about their
timeout. kupdate has nothing to do with the kind of I/O in progress in the
system.
mobile-kupdate _won't_ give you any guarantee of disk cohernecy after the
buffers-flushtime, so if you can live without a working [k]update and so
you can deal with tons of last-year-dirty-buffers-not-yet-flushed-on-disk,
then more simply disable kupdate 8).
