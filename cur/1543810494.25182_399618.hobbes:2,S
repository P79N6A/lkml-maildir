Ah I see the problem I guess. When you restart then your 
timer interrupt catches up the missing jiffies very quickly
and that triggers the softwatchdog. 
Nasty. Perhaps it needs to look at xtime instead and 
let touch_softlockup_watchdog() update that.  But that could
break with NTP then. Perhaps using monotonic_clock() ?
