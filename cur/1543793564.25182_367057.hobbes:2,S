Unfortunately the dvb-core is currently not able to handle hotplugging 
while a dvb application is accessing a dvb-dev-node. This applies 
for every dvb-device, not only for dvb-usb devices, but no one ever tried 
to unplug a DVB PCI card while using it, yet.
Before unplugging a device, you can check if the module is removable to 
make sure that really no application is currently using it. (You will get 
"module in use" then).
We already thought about that problem and we think that dvbdev.c is the 
correct place to start implementing that, but I don't have enough 
knowledge (and time) to do that now, sorry.
regards,
Patrick.
