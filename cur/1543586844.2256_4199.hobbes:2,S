As expected vmalloc additional 2 tlbs aren't visible in the numbers (that
are mostly dominated by I/O anyways), I think it's the best solution to avoid
the order 2 multipage:

The s/kmem_cache_alloc/vmalloc/ change is here for now and it is rock solid
for me (regression testing is still happy):

I think it's ok for inclusion.
