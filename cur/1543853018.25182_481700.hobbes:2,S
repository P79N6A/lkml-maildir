This patchset revises my attempt from last week to allow running klogd
unprivileged without a root shim.  I believe I have addressed all
outstanding objections: in particular, the privilege model enforced by
SELinux is unchanged (you have to have system__syslog_mod to read
/proc/kmsg).  I have also included some nice refactorings (symbolic
constants for sys_syslog opcodes, that sort of thing) and a few
bugfixes (minor and unlikely to affect any live application, but
still).
I hope that this can be considered for 2.6.19; it is low risk in my
opinion and it would be nice to get this functionality into the hands
of the distributors sooner.
