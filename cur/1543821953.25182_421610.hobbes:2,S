I asked Erez about this; I will try to accurately summarize his
response. He indicated that, about 5 or so years ago, when ext2/3's
block size was set to 1K or 2K, but the page size was 4K, they found
that it was possible to get a page which had some of the blocks in the
bufcache, while other blocks were not.
Their solution at the time was to just read again, and that seemed to
fix the problem for them. It was not obvious as to why things were
happening that way, and it may be the case that the second read is no
longer necessary in the current kernel.
