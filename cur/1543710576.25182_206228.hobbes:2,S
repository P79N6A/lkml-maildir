And make oldconfig will go and turn on all the new stuff which is off
in defconfig and on in Kconfig.
But starting with a minimal config is not all that useful because it
doesn't show bloat creep in stuff people commonly use.
The point is not to distill everything down to one number, the point
is to get enough into the report that we can notice growth in all the
important areas. Obviously as things get renamed, moved around, etc.,
some closer inspection will be required to figure out what the impact
is. Changes in config workings are in the same bucket.
