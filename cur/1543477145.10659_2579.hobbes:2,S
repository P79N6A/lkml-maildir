That doesn't help.  It still won't unmount.

It is a bug.  It may not be a serious bug, but it is still a bug.  There
is a difference between root being able to break a system by doing
something entirely reasonable (and unmounting automounted cdroms is a
fairly reasonable thing to expect to be able to do) and root being able to
break it by doing something patently silly.
