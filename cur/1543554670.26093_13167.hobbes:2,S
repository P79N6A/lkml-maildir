The decision here was that I needed to pass a vector of 
<physical address, length, data> pairs.  The elf program header
is dead simple and provides it.  So I either had to invent a
complicated argument passing mechanism for a syscall or have the
kernel parse a file.

That's exactly what my preprocessing does. 
vmlinux is also an elf binary.  As is arch/i386/boot/bvmlinux but it
is compressed.
All mkelfImage does is the pasting of initrd's, command lines,
and just a touch of argument conversion code.
What I don't do deliberately is allow or need setup.S which does
syscalls to run.  All it does are BIOS calls, and store them in a
nasty data structure.  I have replaced that data structure with 
something that is maintainable.  
I would like very much to not need mkelfImage.  However that
requires further changes to the kernel, and I cannot boot an unpatched
kernel with that method.
