Well, I think there are two issues here.  One is that two 
pseudo-physical pages won't necessarily be contigious in bus space, 
because of the pseudo-phys to machine mapping.
The second problem is that devices which can't address all machine 
physical memory (ie, 32-bit PCI devices on machines with >4G memory) 
will need to have bouncebuffers established for them.  Device drivers 
won't necessarily be able to do it because they're not really aware of 
machine addresses.

I think 32-bit-only devices are a bigger concern, no?
