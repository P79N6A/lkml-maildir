Hi
After we started adding a number of new partition block detection
routines for the m68k port we realized that it was probably a good
idea to split the partition block detection code into individual files
rather than keeping them all in genhd.c. This work was done by Roman
Hodek back in the 2.1.x days just before the long feature freeze for
2.2.x. Since then code for detecting a number of other types of
partitions has been added however I think we managed to get them all
included thanks to Roman Zippel.
Anyway I would very much like to get this patch in before 2.4 as it is
a 95KB patch. As potentially it affects all other architectures
(though it shouldn't break for anyone) I reckon it is probably a good
idea to get it tested.
So interested parties, please check

(Linus this is the same as I sent to you for comments except that it
includes the Config.in file I forgot in your mail)
