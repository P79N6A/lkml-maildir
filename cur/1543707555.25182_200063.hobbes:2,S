Actually, I just submitted a patch to fix the default behavior of JFS to
always treat the name as an arbitrary string.  The previous default
depended on the value of CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT.  Setting the mount option
iocharset=utf8 will reject non-utf8 filenames as you propose.
The arbitrary string of bytes is treated as the latin1 charset in that
it is stored as 0x00nn (in UTF2), but JFS really doesn't care what the
character set is.

It's been said before, but a posix-compliant file system should accept
any bytes other that NUL and '/'.
