That is a tautology.  As /dev/epoll is inherently a single threaded 
interface, of course the most effective way for a multithreaded program 
to use it is to have one thread call it then divvy up the events. 
 That's the *only* way a multithreaded program can deal with a single 
threaded interface.
The cost to divvy up the events can be substantial, not the mention the 
cost of funneling them all through a single CPU.  This cost can easily 
be greater than what one saves by combining events.  io_getevents() is a 
great model for divvying events across multiple threads, the poll 
facility should work with that model.
The solution for optimizing the amount of event collapsing is to 
implement concurrency control.

This is a workaround.  You are adding additional code and complexity to 
the caller in order to deal with a deficiency in the interface.  This 
has several problems:
Someone writing to the /dev/epoll interface needs to know that they need 
to write such workaround code.  If they don't know to write the code or 
if they make an error in the workaround code, it is still likely that 
the program will pass testing.  What will result are intermittent, hard 
to diagnose failures in production.
User space does not have the information to address this as well as the 
kernel can.  As a result, the workaround requires more processing in the 
common, non racy case.
The kernel can clearly handle this situation better than user space.  It 
can do the necessary checks while it is still holding the necessary 
locks.  It is less error prone to handle the situation in the kernel. 
 The logic clearly belongs in the kernel.

You're making assumptions about the structure and flow of an 
application.  Sometimes when an application stops having interest in 
this or that event, it needs to free/invalidate the context associated 
with that event.
So that's fine as a strategy for amortizing the cost of 
registration/deregistration, but it isn't universally applicable.
