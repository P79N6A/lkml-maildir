There are 2 MSI-X capable controllers in the system. On IPF this is what
the tables look like:
cciss: offset = 0xfe000 table offset = 0xfe000 BIR = 0x0
cciss: 0: vector = 0,msg data = 0, msg upper addr = 0,msg addr = 0
cciss: 1: vector = 0,msg data = 0, msg upper addr = 0,msg addr = 0
cciss: 2: vector = 0,msg data = 0, msg upper addr = 0,msg addr = 0
cciss: 3: vector = 0,msg data = 0, msg upper addr = 0,msg addr = 0
cciss: using DAC cycles
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:88:00.0[A] -> GSI 71 (level, low) -> IRQ 61
cciss: MSI-X enabled
cciss: offset = 0xfe000 table offset = 0xfe000 BIR = 0x0
cciss: 0: vector = 0,msg data = 0, msg upper addr = 0,msg addr = 0
cciss: 1: vector = 0,msg data = 0, msg upper addr = 0,msg addr = 0
cciss: 2: vector = 0,msg data = 0, msg upper addr = 0,msg addr = 0
cciss: 3: vector = 0,msg data = 0, msg upper addr = 0,msg addr = 0
cciss: using DAC cycles
blocks= 143305920 block_size= 512
heads= 255, sectors= 32, cylinders= 17562
 
blocks= 142130880 block_size= 512
heads= 255, sectors= 32, cylinders= 17418
 
cciss/c2d0:
And this is where we hang, when enabling interrupts in the driver.
The table on x86_64 looks like this:
cciss: Device 0x3230 has been found at bus 11 dev 0 func 0
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:0b:00.0[A] -> GSI 16 (level, low) -> IRQ 169
cciss: offset = 0xfe000 table offset = 0xfe000 BIR = 0x0
cciss: 0: vector = 0,msg data = 40d1, msg upper addr = 0,msg addr =
fee00000
cciss: 1: vector = 0,msg data = 40d9, msg upper addr = 0,msg addr =
fee00000
cciss: 2: vector = 0,msg data = 40e1, msg upper addr = 0,msg addr =
fee00000
cciss: 3: vector = 0,msg data = 40e9, msg upper addr = 0,msg addr =
fee00000
cciss: using DAC cycles
