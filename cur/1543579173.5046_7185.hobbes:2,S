Ahh.  What I was missing was that by specifying /dev/md0 as the root device,
not only do you get an identical map for the kernels, but the root device
remains /dev/md0 no matter which drive fails and LILO/kernel don't need to
do anything special to find it.  This assumes the BIOS can boot from /dev/hdc
to start with (i.e. /dev/hda is totally gone).
How does MD/RAID0 know which array should be /dev/md0?  What if you had a
second array on /dev/hdb and /dev/hdd, would that become /dev/md0 (assuming
it had a kernel/boot sector)?
Cheers, Andreas
