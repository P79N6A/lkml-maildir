Hello,
Symptomes: Dies silently and it is unpredictable , sometimes Hardisk leds
stays on , sometime not. Can be weeks between crashes or just few minutes.
I used a lot of the 2.4.17 for many months without any crashes.
 only way to fix it is to restart the machine with reset.
I have read something about a new aic7xxx driver, but somehow haven't
found the driver anywhere.
The machine is a Apple 9500 with
PowerPC G3 (upgrade)
512MB Ram
Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation 3c905C-TX [Fast Etherlink] (rev 116).
MACE ethernet
  Masquarading between both interfaces public to private network
SCSI storage controller: Adaptec 7892A (rev 2).
SCSI storage controller: Adaptec AHA-2940U2/W (rev 1).
  There is 4 hard disks 2 on each host controller, They are Linux Raid 1+0
  And the swap is also mirrored on them 2x raid 1 (512MB)
  This machine serves nfs to the private network.
Thank you,
Philippe
