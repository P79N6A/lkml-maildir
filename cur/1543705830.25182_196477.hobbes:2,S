OK, then this proves that this thread has been going on _way_ too
long, because not only have we discussed both scenarios during the
course of it, but I have managed to confuse both of them in the same
post :-).
In the scenario you describe, where the disc is unmounted, there is
nothing for cdrecord to complain about.  All that could really be done
is to hack cdrecord to reset the device afterwards for broken devices,
which would presumably flush the device's own cache.  However, even
this may not be sufficient, as from reading another post in this
thread, it seems that we need to force the drive to report that the
media has changed before the kernel will flush _it's_ buffers.
Obviously, that could be worked around in the kernel, but I would
expect the device to report media changed if it's been erased,
(although whether that is part of the spec or not, I have no idea).
John.
