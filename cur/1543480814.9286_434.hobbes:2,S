Hello,
This is a followup to my previous post regarding the kernel Oops I was
having in 2.0.3X when loading modules with a codesize on PAGE_SIZE
boundaries.
The following patch seems to make the problem go away.  Can a knowledgeable
kernel hacker please comment on whether this is the right solution, or if
my problem lies elsewhere?
