We'd like to keep boot as small as possible. Boot might be a floppy or
flash while lib lives on your cluster's main file server. This is solvable
with the 2.4 multiple mount technology, but that same technology will soon
give us per-process namespaces so playing radically with the filesystem
standard in the interim is a wasted effort.
