agreed, pre5aa1 was swapping too much by default, so the above echos are
recommended. btw, I did further developement in the weekend and it
should be better now by default than pre5aa1 with the above sysctl
settings.  I'll do more tests on bigger hardware in the next days (I was
on the laptop).
thanks for the feedback,
Andrea
