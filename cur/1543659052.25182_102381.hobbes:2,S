Hi.
In the case s.o. wants to pull the patch:
http://www.rocklinux.org/sources/package/base/linux24/82-raid5-niceer-output.patch
It is only a one-liner. It is not really nice since I print the
"writing arround L2 cache" text when XOR_SELECT_TEMPLATE is defined -
this might also be the case for an later AlitVec version for PowerPC
or so. So we might want a more generic text - or a text in the
appropriated .h file whetre XOR_SELECT_TEMPLATE is defined ...
