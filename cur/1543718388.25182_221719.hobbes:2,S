Subject: PCI errors still in 2.6.6-mm4 but rare

I reported previously that after upgrading to something around 2.6.6
I started getting strange PCI errors. Somebody replied that in mm it 
should be fixed. But still I can see PCI errors like this:
May 20 23:04:13 polb01 Aieee - PCI error! status 0x008008, PCI status 
0x8290
What does that mean? (= how bad my system is broken and can I loose all my 
data fast?) How can I fix this?
Thanks in advance,
Grzegorz Kulewski
