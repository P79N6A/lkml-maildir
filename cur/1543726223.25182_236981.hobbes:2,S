That way I picture the problem permits those threads to migration across
CPUs and therefore kill interrupt performance from cache thrashing. Do
you have a solution for that ? I like the way you're doing it now with
irqd() in that it's CPU-local, but as you know it's not priority sensitive.

I think it's pretty complementary to what's going on, but it's also driven
by application demand, how it could possibly hook into the scheduler or
something else like that. There isn't a clear precedence for how to use
something like this potentially. LynxOS doesn't have priorities above
interrupt priorities, that mask interrupts somehow, but are folks that need
that kind of stuff and could certainly be added in a relatively trivial
manner.
My answer would be something like yes it's needed, but not now.
