Does an MkLinux kernel supply a "Mach factor" value like Digital UNIX?
: The load average numbers give the number of jobs in the run queue
: for the last 5 seconds, the last 30 seconds, and the last 60 seconds.
: The Mach factor is a variant of the load average, given for the same
: intervals; the closer its value to 0, the higher the load.
I'd like to know how to get this value. Also, I'd appreciate suggestions
for generating an estimated Mach factor from a normal load average on
a normal Linux kernel.
