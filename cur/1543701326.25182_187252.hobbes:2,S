If those pages are under writeout then they are clean and
filemap_fdatawrite() has nothing to do.
If, however, those pages were redirtied while under I/O then they are
dirty, on dirty_pages and are under writeout.  In that case
filemap_fdatawrite() must wait for the current write to complete and must
start a new write.

If you are referring to this code in mpage_writepage():
		lock_page(page);
		if (wbc->sync_mode != WB_SYNC_NONE)
			wait_on_page_writeback(page);
		if (page->mapping == mapping && !PageWriteback(page) &&
					test_clear_page_dirty(page)) {
then I don't see the race - the page lock synchronises the two threads?
