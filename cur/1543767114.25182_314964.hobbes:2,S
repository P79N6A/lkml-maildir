Already done.
My initial report to Eric Moore is dated mai 15 2004 (2.6.6), so you can
understand why I'm a bit afraid beeing hit by the same bug more than 6 monthes
and 3 stable kernel releases later.
After the second report dated january 26 2005 (2.6.9),
he sent me fusion 3.1.19 saying it solves the problem.
As far as I could check, no official kernel is running 3.1.19
2.6.12 will jump to 3.1.20, so I can assume it's solved;
also I have no way to verify it since the bug will append only in case of
something going wrong on the SCSI chain, what tends to append only
once every several monthes, and not on all servers.

I must apology about this one because it's solved in 2.6.11
When I posted to kernel mailing list about it (january 28 2005) I could not
track the memory leak problem down to tigon3 driver. Only posts from others
led me to the conclusion, and after migrating from 2.6.10 to 2.4, I forgot to
retest with 2.6.11
My fault.

They are very much awared about the problem (initial post dated january 5 2005)
and tracked it to the OSX surprising handling of delayed ack. So, as a
developper having to deal fairly often with interfacing closed systems I can
understand how their task is hard since they have to workaround instead of OSX
beeing fixed.
If you want to try to reproduce it, you need a gigabit connected PC (Intel
pro1000 in my case, but as far as I could understand it, it is not related
to pro1000 offload capabilities) pushing datas (TCP connection such as
libsmbclient) through a gigabit switch to a 100 Mbps connected Mac OSX 10.3
In short, you need a situation where flow control from Linux to OSX is needed.
