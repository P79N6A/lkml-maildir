I notice that rc1 doesn't have Juergen Sawinski's updates (0.23/0.24)
to i810_audio that allow ICH4 (i845) based chipsets to work.  They've
been in AC for a while (since pre5 I think) - just wondering if that is a
merge problem or if there is something else the matter (they seem to
work great on the i845E I've got.)
