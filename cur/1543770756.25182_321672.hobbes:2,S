But why fix what isn't broken?  I can tell all my other programs, from
dd to mount, that I want to use the udev-created /dev/green_burner, so
why do you indicate such usage is _deprecated_ in cdrecord?  For such
device nodes, a _filesystem_ is the preferred name=>number index, so
why add an extra strange file "just because Solaris does".
And why again do you need stable SCSI addresses for my _USB_ drive?
