It would seem that the o/s has enough information to separate pages into 
  categories such as 'part of a program,' 'unwritten user write() data,' 
'user read() data sequential," 'user read data random' (read after seek) 
and the like. It would be nice if admins could do tuning on how the o/s 
weights giving these memory. The swappiness tuner is certainly a start, 
in practice it does help with atypical loads.
And Nick's latest stuff against 2.6.7-rc1-mm1 certainly seems to work 
very well on my little 96MB slow box with a few dozen windows open. I 
would call it the best I've run on this box, ever.
