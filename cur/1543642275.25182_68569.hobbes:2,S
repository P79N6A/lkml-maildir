I agree that partial completions are the right thing to do here, and in
fact this is how the interface was originally remember?
However, I don't see how this is a two-liner change. Basically you are
changing bi_end_io() from a completion to partial completion invokation,
which requires changing (and complicating) all of them. Just adding
a sector count to bio_endio() does not enable that to partially complete
some pages. What am I missing?
