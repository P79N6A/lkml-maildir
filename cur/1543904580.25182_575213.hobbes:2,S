That would just save reading the directories. Not sure
it helps that much. Much better would be actually if it didn't stat the 
individual files (and force their dentries/inodes in). I bet it does that to 
find out if they are directories or not. But in a modern system it could just 
check the type in the dirent on file systems that support 
that and not do a stat. Then you would get much less dentries/inodes.
Also I expect in general the new slub dcache freeing that is pending
will improve things a lot.
But even if updatedb was fixed to be more efficient we probably
still need a general solution for other tree walking programs
that cannot be optimized this way.
