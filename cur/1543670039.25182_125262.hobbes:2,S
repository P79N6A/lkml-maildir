It is happening on both machines I am using whose hardware configuration differs slightly, however both of them are equipped with ATI video cards (ATI Rage 128 and ATI Radeon 8500), and both of them run the same version of X-server. That's about all they have in common.

According to 
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=543
 , a variant
  of the problem happens by just exiting from Gnome and running startx
  again.
I surely hit bug 543 in 2.5.65 IIRC, and guess what...
  ATI Radeon 7500 Mobile - XFree 4.2.1
According to other emails on lkml, it appears that DRM and/or AGP
  new kernel code might be at fault. I don't actually remember
  seeing non-Radeon cards being hit by such problems though...
When the ex-PC from my brother is supplied a new USB keyboard and
  a hard disk I'll try reproducing on its Voodoo5 :)
