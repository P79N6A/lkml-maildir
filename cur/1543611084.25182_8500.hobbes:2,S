Here's some more data about the problem reported by Anton where "ps",
"top", "killall", etc block and "kill" doesn't work.
I have encountered this behaviour with kernels 2.4.14 and 2.4.16 but not
2.4.13 nor 2.4.7 (although 2.4.13 hung this box in a different way).
This was observed on an SMP Pentium III, which does some multithreaded
computation.
I can't give precise instructions on how to replicate this bug, but
perhaps it can be repeated simply by exercising kernel threading?
Luke.
