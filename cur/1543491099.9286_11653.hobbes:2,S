Since I wrote that, I've been home and checked my systems, which run a
variety of RedHat 4.1, 5.1 and 5.2 installs, and all are heavily
bloated. I have to assume that at some time, the ones on the system I
posted from were tweaked to reduce the bloat...
Yours is the 23rd reply commenting on my post, but the other 22 were
all private. However, I'd say I've had enough replies over this...
Best wishes from Riley.
