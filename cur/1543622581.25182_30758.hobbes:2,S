Your idea should work on deletion, when the inode were
about to be destroyed, but ...

... of course, there still is the problem of hard links.
If you unlink a file, it might still be around under
another name.
Consider:
$ ln bigfile newbigfile
$ rm bigfile
Under your scheme, maybe bigfile would be moved to the
undeletion area ... fine.
The problem would start if the ownership was changed
to root, because then 'newbigfile' would also be owned
by root and you could no longer access your file ;)
