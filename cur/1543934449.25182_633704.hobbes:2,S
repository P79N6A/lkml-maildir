ebizzy is designed to generate a workload resembling common web application
server workloads.  It is especially useful for testing
changes to memory management, and whenever a highly threaded application
with a large working set and many vmas is needed.
This is release 0.3 of ebizzy.  It reports a rate of transactions per
second, compiles on Linux/Solaris/FreeBSD/HPUX, and scales better.
