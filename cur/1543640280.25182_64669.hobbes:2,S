I think you're being too ""mainstream" orientated" here.  Let's look
at something called PCMCIA.  PCMCIA CF cards.  They're IDE devices
that only do PIO.
The majority of ARM platforms being actively produced today provide a
PCMCIA or CF (_not_ cardbus) socket.  Neither PCI nor Cardbus makes any
sense in these machines.  Why?  Because they're not your average power
hungry desktop box that's always plugged into the mains supply.
I think we're going to have PIO mode IDE around for a fair (ten at
least?) number of years yet.
