I was _not_ talking about ext2 at all. I was talking about the bforget and
brelse semantics. As bforget fallback to brelse you shouldn't expect
bforget to really destroy the buffer. It may do that but only if it's
possible.
You are using a _trick_ to let bforget to do the thing you want. If all
filesystem needs such thing it's ugly having to duplicate that current
ext2 tricks all over the place.

IMHO we should drop all that race-prone tricks isntead of adding new ones.
If you use bforget to avoid fs corruption you are asking for troubles and
IMHO you are going in the wrong direction.
You may change bforget to do the right thing cleanly, but it will be badly
blocking. While you shouldn't block unless you are the one who wants to
reuse the buffer that is currently under I/O or dirty. So if you'll change
bforget then you'll block in the wrong place.
