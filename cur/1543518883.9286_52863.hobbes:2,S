I tracked the problem with this card (driver) down to the fact that if klogd
is loaded with -c x where x is 6 or less.  if klogd is loaded with -c 7 or
-c 8, everything is fine.
Could some printk be causing this?
klogd is:
[root@krillin:/root] klogd -v
klogd 1.3-3
[root@krillin:/root] syslogd -v
syslogd 1.3-3
[root@krillin:/root]
I'll try stripping all printk's from xirc2ps_cs (sp?) and see what happens
(and serial_cs)
