The bus shutdown is clearly something which shouldn't be done in the normal
idle loop, but only when explicit sleep mode is requested and when the
kernel makes sure that all IO is quiescied [similar to what the sleep code
on the ppc/mac port does; see e.g. 
drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:powerbook_sleep_G3]. Such a thing could be 
e.g. controlled from apmd.
