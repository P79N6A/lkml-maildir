What makes you think mark_offset_tsc is slow? Do you have any comparative 
numbers?  It might just be that the workload you are throwing at it justifies 
it. (For e.g. if your workload does a zillion system calls, system_call will 
show up as a hot spot in oprofile - doesn't necessarily mean it is slow - 
it's just overused.) Can you post the relevant code?
