There is a vesafb-tng (the next generation) on Gentoo. I 
applied it to my 2.6.7; it allows, among other things, to load 
the vesafb driver as a module and to specify resolutions with 
the "usual" (widthxheight-bitdepth@refresh) syntax.
On my video card (GeForce2 Go) it doesn't seem to work very 
well though.
