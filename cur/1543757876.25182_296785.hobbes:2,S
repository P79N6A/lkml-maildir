One thing surprises me: the sockets don't get IO resources allocated:

which doesn't happen in earlier kernels. In lspci this shows itself as:
        I/O window 0: 00000000-00000003                                         
        I/O window 1: 00000000-00000003

My gut tells me

is responsible for this "no resource available" message, because the other
ones relate to other areas.
If the error persists, it'd be great if you could apply the other PCMCIA
patches to the working -rc4 tree and check if it continues to work -- or,
the other way round, removing the PCMCIA patches completely and checking
whether it works then.
Thanks,
