This is where the multiple support issue comes in. In ibmtr_cs.c we do 
ioremap the addresses so pcmcia all works nicely. What we don't do at 
present is an ioremap in ibmtr.c for the non-pcmcia adapters (isa & mca). 
So, I suppose the real fix would be to implement the ioremap in ibmtr.c so 
that regular read/writes can be used everywhere in the driver. (This is 
half the battle with changes to the driver, it supports so many 
combinations that one change for one type of adapter can kill support for 
another adapter, and that's my bottom line with updates: No loss of 
functionality we already had.)
Or we could just tell people to use the cardbus token ring adapter on ppc 
instead ;)
