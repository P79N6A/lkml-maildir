Nope, that was a summary of the beliefs expressed in about three dozen
separate emails when I first proposed the idea, nothing more and
nothing less.
I'll be quite clear about my stance on this issue: I earn good money
sorting out the mess made by newbies who install a Linux distribution
(any distribution, that makes little difference), then try to upgrade
via tarballs that all extract into the same directory, the way the
Linux kernel tarballs do, along with a small number of the other
utilities.
Invariably, by the time I get called in, they've extracted the latest
kernel tarball, tried to compile it, failed, extracted an earlier
tarball into the same tree, tried to compile that, ended up with
something that's a mixture of the two, and somehow managed to get the
system to boot off this composite kernel!!! Ditto with probably a
dozen of the other major utilities.
If Linus was to start doing what he should've been doing for years,
and making each kernel tarball extract into a separate directory tree,
and the various utility authors were all to do the same, my earnings
would fall through the floor. As a result, I'm more than happy for
Linus and the other authors to continue with their current practice.
I'd be a fool to be otherwise.

Your email address suggests that you're one of the lucky ones to get
free Internet access, in which case your above comment is more than
understandable. It's just a pity it isn't also true.
Best wishes from Riley.
