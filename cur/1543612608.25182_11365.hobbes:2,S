Well you have to deal with the general case. A single threaded
app linking against a multithreaded lib. It mightn't be just
shared FILE*'s that could cause problems.

I don't think this will work as I said before current apps that
use _unlocked() functions directly manipulate the stdio structures,
hence a "new smarter locking stdio" would never get used by existing
compiled apps.

It could, but what if an existing interface (lib) is changed
from signle to multithreaded. You can't preclude this.
