exactly this is a point: my disk can do 5mb/s with almost random seeks,
and linux indeed reads 5mb/s from it. but the userpsace process doing
read() only ever sees 2mb/s because the kernel throes away all the nice
pages.
I doubt vsftpd would help at all.
(one can easily get 2000 or more parallel downloads, if you are willing to
go with 1kb/s).
