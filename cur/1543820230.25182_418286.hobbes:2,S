Linux 2.6.16 worked, 2.6.17-rc does not. As far as I'm concerned, this is a 
regression.
Linux should not be forced to make arguably silly policy decisions like 
disabling NX for 32bit applications not but "system processes", and as Andi 
has mentioned NX _is_ runtime configurable, should one wish to disable it for 
a given binary on an NX-enforcing kernel.
Wine pretends to be Windows. Therefore Wine should enforce the same "default 
policy" as Windows, or make it runtime configurable in the same manner. In 
this case, the workaround is cheap, fixes a real world application, and does 
not interfere with Linux's NX policy.
Ultimately, we'll see if Alexandre Julliard agrees with the change. If not, 
then I guess this particular application will fail to work on 2.6.17, forcing 
me to investigate alternatives.
