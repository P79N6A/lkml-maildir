AFAIU, no. Zlib may eat a lot of input and do not produce much output, but 
on Z_FINISH it may ask an undetermined amount of additional output space. 
So, we must even regulate the amount of input we pass to zlib_deflate(). 
In case of Z_SYNC_FLUSH, things are more determined.
Another question, does JFFSx *really* need the peaces of a 4K page to be 
independently uncompressable? It it wouldn't be required, we would achieve 
better compression if we have saved the zstream state. :-) But it is too 
late to change things at least for JFFS2.
