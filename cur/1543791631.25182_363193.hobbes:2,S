You might check booting w/ noapic to see if that changes the behaviour
in 2.6.10.
I know there were some pretty troubling issues w/ the nforce2 early in
the 2.6 cycle.  See
http://atlas.et.tudelft.nl/verwei90/nforce2/index.html
 for some details.
Maciej: I noticed you had been involved with earlier nforce2 issues.
Does the above change in the ioapic pin1 value look familiar?
Digging around in the bkcvs git web between 2.6.9 and 2.6.10, I found
the following ioapic related changes:

Any clues?
Jean-Christian: Since it ACPI is involved, have you verified that you're
running the current BIOS for your system?
