Of course, we could just decide to try to switch from level to 
edge-triggered if the irq storm thing ever triggers. Right now we disable 
the irq entirely, which means that _if_ it was just due to a polarity 
error, we're screwed even if it should have been easy to fix by just 
turning it into edge-high.
The code to do that should be trivial: make __report_bad_irq() try to 
switch to edge mode if it's not edge already. Hmm?
