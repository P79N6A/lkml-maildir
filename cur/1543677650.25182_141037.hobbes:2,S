All disk info is in the /sys/block directory, does that work for you?

It will contain things if you have a device that uses the USB major
plugged in.

I think the scsi core will create you a directory that you can use that
will have the proper lifetime that you are looking for.  If not, I can
look into doing something else for some of the other USB devices that
are not using the USB major.
