    His grep seems to be two things. Poor software design. This does not
only afflict linux but pretty much everyone. The power behind opensource
is when someone comes around with a better design they can show it to the
world. Then it can be incorporated. We all know linux is not a perfect OS.
In fact we should never think this. The day we do is the day we stop
moving forward.    
    The second grep is the delay we see. Well M$ also suffers from this
problem as well as others. I think the root of this problem is each
version of kernel is a massive change. Instead of a bunch of new kernels
with smaller changes a massive redesign is done. Doing it this way is
much harder since new bugs that where not there before show up.
