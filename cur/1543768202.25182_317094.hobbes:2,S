Great. The machine came like this? I wish OEMs wouldn't do such things...

Great.

There is a patch pending for the TSC problem - using the pmtimer instead
in this case.
But the distributed timer interrupt problem is weird. It should not happen.
You sure it was IRQ 0 that was duplicated and not "LOC" ?
When you watch -n1 cat /proc/interrupts does the rate roughly match
up to 1000Hz?
