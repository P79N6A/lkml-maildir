How do you find out the speed of the ISA bus?  AFAIK there is no
standardized way to do that.  On the Geode SC2200 the ISA bus speed is
usually the PCI clock divided by 4 giving 33MHz/4=8.3MHz or
30/4=7.5MHz, but with no external ISA devices it's possible to
overclock the ISA bus to /3 to run it at 11MHz or so.  But without
poking at some CPU and southbridge specific registers to find out the
PCI bus speed and the ISA bus divisor you can't really tell.
So if you do udelay based on a 6MHz clock (I think you can safely
assume that any 386 based system runs the ISA bus at least that fast)
you'll waste at least 30% and maybe even 100% more time for the delay
after every _p call.
