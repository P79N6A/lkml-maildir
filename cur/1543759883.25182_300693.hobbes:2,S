Which all fits very nicely with MEMLOCK rlimit and a tiny wrapper
that sets !SCHED_OTHER and execs the audio app..
and as I mentioned a few times if we really want to go for a magic
uid/gid-based approach we should at least have one that's useable for
all capabilities so it can replace the oracle hack aswell.  But the
proponents of the patch weren't iterested to invest the tiniest bit
of work over what they submited.
