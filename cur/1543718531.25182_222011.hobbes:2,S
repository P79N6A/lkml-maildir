It means that we need to be more careful to ensure that processes all 
processes are frozen than we do with your implementation: we can't have 
processes forking or exiting because a timer fires while we're writing 
the first part of the image. (I saw that happen with bad effects).

Yes.

With the hooks, I don't have to worry about ordering at all. Once the 
atomic_t comes down to zero, every process has either entered the 
refrigerator because it hit a start/restart hook or wasn't doing 
anything to start with. I don't have to care about ordering because 
anything that does start activity while I'm signalling hits a hook and 
gets refrigerated anyway, even if it's not in response to the pseudo-signal.

:>. I'll put benchmarking on my todo list...

... and won't spend too long on it :>. I think I can guess.
