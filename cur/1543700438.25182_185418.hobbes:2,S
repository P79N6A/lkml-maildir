Basically that causes the scsi layer to only send sbp2 1 command at a
time, so it's a performance hit.
I'm guessing that your card doesn't like getting some many commands at
once. It's possible that your sbp2 device itself cannot handle it
(generally, I've found it to be caused by the card though).
As far as 10mbs, you have to remember that even though firewire is much
higher than that, your drive is still an IDE, and the firewire is still
going through an IDE bridge. So the limitation lies in the IDE bridge.
I've seen performance as high as 34MB/s with good IDE bridges and
drives, though.
