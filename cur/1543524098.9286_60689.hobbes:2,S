I have noticed this happen to me when I have started X or am running a 
program in X.

I haven't had this problem but I don't have any partitions which fsck 
checks at the same time.
This is interesting I had thought this may be a problem with my hardare

I'll include some more detailed inforation about my system.

As I mentioned in my previous post this is using the Abit BP6 
motherboard.  I have also experienced "hdb: lost interrupt" under 
similar conditions.
