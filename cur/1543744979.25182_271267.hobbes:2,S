Do you mean "when the inode cache is being shrunk"?
By "truncate" there you mean "unlink"?

I didn't think that it would.

Sorry, you can see I'm having some trouble understanding your reply.
I think you're forgetting that tmpfs inodes live nowhere but in memory:
if shrinking the inode cache were to remove tmpfs inodes, it would be a
considerably more temporary fs than could ever be useful.  There's an
extra dget that keeps dentry and inode safe from pruning.
mpol_shared_policy_init is appropriate when we might want to allocate
pages to the inode (regular file or long symlink); mpol_free_shared_policy
is appropriate when we've given up the possibility of allocating pages to
such an inode - that's after shmem_delete_inode's shmem_truncate.
Whereas shmem_destroy_inode is the complement of shmem_alloc_inode,
neither of which should get into this mpol stuff.
If you're unconvinced, please suggest a test case which will do the
wrong thing, and I'll check it out tomorrow - thanks.
Hugh
