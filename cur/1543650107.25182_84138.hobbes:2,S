Guessing:
1. readlink and follow permissions were not distinct
2. symlink following in /proc wasn't done normally
3. therefore, readlink implied access to the target's data
Rather than fix #1 or #2, readlink() got restricted.

Being able to readlink() in the fd directory is much less
revealing than the content of the maps file. IMHO both of
them should be restricted, but the "maps" file matters more.
Just look at this:   cat /proc/1/maps
This all looks completely mixed up. Users SHOULD NOT be able
to read /proc/1/maps, but SHOULD be able to readlink at least
any /proc/1/* symlink that has meaning in the current namespace.
(so not if the observer is in a chroot environment)
