It is not.

Sure, I can. First thing I did was in fact to try and reproduce that.

Hmm....
(examining Makefile...)
I see. So there cannot be usual targets before including Rules.make,
and my copy of the tree have these. And if I move them after inclusion,
everything builds just fine.
Perhaps it should be documented somewhere.
Well. So at the end it seems to be not a vanilla kernel problem. That's good.
Bye,
