Thanks for the report Marcin.
We have a lot of section mismatch warnings at present.
I am personally awaiting merge of x86.git and first
batch from Andrew Morton before I start to fix them.
This is for two reasons:
1) I know several warnings are fixed in the two trees
2) I expect these two merges to touch a lot of the files
   where I need to fix the warnings.
Can you please repost no earlier than when you see -rc1. I hope that
my builds get down below 25 warnings when we get there (> 120 warnings
when I did a full build last time).
