Hi.
I have tried to adapt the ext3 patch for pre6 to pre7, but many things
in the buffer and cache sections (vmscan.c and so on) have changed...
I also saw in CVS that there have been changes to make it work on pre7. 
But I did not guess how to make a patch from CVS.
Anyone out there has it ?
BTW: I see there are a bunch of chages in ext3 patch outside its own
fs subtree (try_to_free_pages and so on). Why are not integrated in
mainline ?
TIA
