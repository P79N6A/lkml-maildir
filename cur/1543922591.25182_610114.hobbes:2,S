Well when doing a lspci here are some specific examples:
03:02.0 Multimedia controller: Philips Semiconductors SAA7146 (rev 01)
What modules would you think you'd need to compile to get this to work?
No it's not budget card os buget card ci even though the card its self
has no cam interface
00:14.2 Audio device: ATI Technologies Inc SB600 Azalia
Is there any indication from this piece of info that the intel hda
driver is required?
00:12.0 SATA controller: ATI Technologies Inc SB600 Non-Raid-5 SATA
This uses AHCI
As for the i2c and the hardware monitoring support well that's mostly guess work
Half the time it's easier doing a lsmod when booted on a livecd and
trying to figure out what options are required from the module names
which sometime can be just as tricky.
Why not auto detect the CPU the same way GCC does and automatically
set the correct CPU and then go the whole hog and let GCC use the
correct flags if it's new enough using native
I can't understand why you wouldn't find this useful when setting up a
customised kernel.
Maybe even having a make addnewhardware option to quickly add extra
devices to your config file.
