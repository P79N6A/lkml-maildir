When one defines it one way you can be sure there'll come some company
and figure something out that doesn't fit into that representation.
Like - Stick a board into the CPU slot of some motherboard. That board
has two DualCore, SMT chips.
Oops.
Now the funny part - there is a company selling those things (not
dualcore yet, but SMT anyhow).
How do you fit it into that model?
