Oh yes, they do -- as Venkatesh pointed out, the TSC stops if the CPU is in
the "deep sleep" power state. And better support for deeper sleep states is
in the working...
Also, the cpufreq code currently can only update the timing code with an
inaccuracy of up to one jiffy. If transitions happen in between two timer
ticks, timing becomes inaccurate by -0.5<x<0.5 jiffy. So, if you're
transitioning back and forth a lot, it becomes quite inaccurate over time.
It's the best we can do, and with john's new timer core, we'll be able to
reduce this issue to zero.
In addition, notebooks won't be changing their CPU's frequency behind their 
kernel's back in future as often -- a call to disable this BIOS interference
was added into 2.6.10-rc2.

I agree with handling TMTA specially, as it uses such a different approach
to CPU frequency scaling _and_ gets TSC right. Therefore, ACK.
Thanks,
