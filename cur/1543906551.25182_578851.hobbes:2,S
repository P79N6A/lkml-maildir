Exceedingly.  It's a way of contacting arch maintainers, that's all.  It
isn't really a place to discuss new infrastructural concepts which affect
multiple features.

I saw one email from Vivek expressing on-general-principle concerns.  It
was hardly thorough or irreconcilable-looking.
Let's drag this thing into the daylight and poke at it a bit.
