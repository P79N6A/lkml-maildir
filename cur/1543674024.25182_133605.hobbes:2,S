You need to reproduce the oops you get when you modprobe the module.
The oops with this driver built in is different, and akpm's changes
won't tell us which one causes the problem.
Instead of adding a character to each of those strings, could you
remove the 'Y' character so the strings remain the same length as
the original - that may cause the oops to reappear.
