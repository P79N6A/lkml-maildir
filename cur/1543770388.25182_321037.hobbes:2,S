Hi everyone,
Which device is /dev/console pointing to ? or is it a virtual device ? 
Actually why this node is made?
Why kernel default not providing a control terminal on /dev/console but 
on other device ?
It is not surprising that we can use CTRL-C to terminate some process on 
i386 linux on the Desktop machine,  is that mean the shell on our 
desktop is not using /dev/console ? so where are the shell running on?
Hope anyone can do me a favour.
Regards,
TOM
