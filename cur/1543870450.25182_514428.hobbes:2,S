I think you're right, there is at least one path that I now saw
getting out of spufs_run_spu incorrectly. In particular, when
spu_reacquire_runnable() fails, we never call the master stop,
which is a bug, but should happen very infrequently in practice.
Do you see another case where we end up with the same problem?
If not, I'll prepare a patch to fix this one case.
