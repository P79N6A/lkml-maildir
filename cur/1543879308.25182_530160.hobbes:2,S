  OK, attached is a patch which changes prev_page to prev_index and offset
to prev_offset. It's still a bit misleading that in mm/filemap.c, variables
with page-numbers are called <something>_index while in mm/readahead.c they
are often called just offset... But let's leave it for next time.

Rename file_ra_state.prev_page to prev_index and file_ra_state.offset to
prev_offset.  Also update of prev_index in do_generic_mapping_read() is now
moved close to the update of prev_offset.
