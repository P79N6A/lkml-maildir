I use OSF/1^WDigital Unix^WCompaq^WHP Tru64 Unix here at work, and with
version 5, they've got a nice persistent device naming system (I don't
claim to know how it works however).  The first hard drive found is
/dev/disk/dsk0, the second is /dev/disk/dsk1, etc.  It doesn't matter
how you get to the drive (which is important if you want multipathing -
the controller and bus should NOT figure into the device name or you are
going to have problems).  If you remove dsk0, there won't be another
dsk0 (unless you clean it out of the device database).

I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
