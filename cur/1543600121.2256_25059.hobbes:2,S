The code is correct, but if one is adding explicit types, for clarity
and to avoid introducing bugs, then I think that code like this is
exactly where they most belong:
  if ((size_t) len <= sizeof(short) || (size_t) len > sizeof(*sunaddr))
If that prevents one person from later writing buggy code like:
  if ((size_t) len <= sizeof(short))
then it's a Good Thing.
