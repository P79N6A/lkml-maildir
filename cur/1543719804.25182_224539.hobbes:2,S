Hello,
   Can you give more details - Like which machine which vendor etc.,
On a sony vaio pcg frv31 laptop/ redhat 9.0/ after firing some 36,000+ request
my select multiplexed server used to fail. With select I believe you not get
any packet loss...

PS. If you can post the code that will be great...
