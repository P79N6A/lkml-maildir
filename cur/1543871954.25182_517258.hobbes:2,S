Nope, we didn't make the mistake of nailing down what a "container" was
too far before it is implemented.  We talked before about
containers-within-containers because, inevitably if you provide a
feature you'll end up having to deal with virtualising systems that in
turn use that feature.

It's not even really the term, it's the semantics.
