All,
	This tarball shows an example on how to use the LD_PRELOAD method of
calling vsyscall-gtod. This method is used in the absense of
vsyscall-gtod_B3-part3 patch, or on systems without a sysenter enabled
glibc. The example provides a micro-benchmark that compares the
performance of gettimeofday() when calling it normally, or through the
LD_PRELOAD method.
thanks
