Yes. They have to be. We could make them "unsigned long" or something, but 
the fact is, they do have all the pointer attributes: they are pointers to 
structures, they have _meaning_.

Absolutely. Which is why sparse extends the C type system so that you can 
be a pointer yet _also_ not be something you can directly dereference.
The code
        int __user * a;
        *a = 0;
        return *a;
complains about
	test.c:6:3: warning: dereference of noderef expression
	test.c:7:10: warning: dereference of noderef expression
in sparse.

.. and this would be a total disaster.
Think about it. The user pointer isn't just a "value". It has a type it 
points to. We want to do
	if (get_user(len, &uiov32->iov_len) ||
		...
and yes, the above is a real example. In fact, if you grep for "get_user" 
in linux/*/*.c _most_ of the uses seem to be of this type.
In other words: user pointers _are_ pointers. You have to be able to 
access member names through them etc. It's just that you can't dereference 
them directly - but they definitely have all the other attributes of a 
pointer.

Yes. Handles are a bad idea. They make the code unreadable and totally 
type-less.
Realize that if you use just one type (the "handle") for user pointers, 
you also totally lose all C type-checking. You can't see the difference 
between a "pointer to an old-style 'struct stat'" and a "pointer to a 
new-style 'struct stat64'". So then you'd have to add your own crud to do 
type verifiations (add magic words to the handle that describe the type 
etc). 
It's a nightmare.
You want strict _static_ type analysis. Static type analysis has zero 
run-time costs, and means that you get the "right" answer at compile-time. 
And that's exactly what sparse is all about. Static type analysis.
