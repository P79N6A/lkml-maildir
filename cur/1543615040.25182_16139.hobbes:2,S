You have to set type 'auto' in fstab and add 'udf' in first line of 
/etc/filesystems.
Follow is piece of man mount:
              The type iso9660 is the default.  If no  -t  option
              is  given,  or  if  the auto type is specified, the
              superblock  is  probed  for  the  filesystem   type
              (minix, ext, ext2, ext3, xiafs, iso9660, jfs, reis-
              erfs, romfs, ufs, ntfs,  qnx4,  bfs,  xfs,  cramfs,
              hfs,  hpfs,  adfs,  vxfs  are  supported).  If this
              probe fails,  mount  will  try  to  read  the  file
              /etc/filesystems,  or,  if  that  does  not  exist,
              /proc/filesystems.  All  of  the  filesystem  types
              listed  there  will be tried, except for those that
              are labeled "nodev" (e.g., devpts, proc and nfs).
Please tell me is you successfully done it.
On my system it do not work. :(
