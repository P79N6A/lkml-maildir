Hi, i recently updated my kernel to 2.4.9 from 2.2.13,
quite a large jump obviously, im in slackware 7.0, ok
so here is my problem. after updating the kernel i did
ppp-go, it dialed and i heard the noise that it makes
when its dialing an ISP then at the end, it says:
seriel connection made then on the next line i get:
Couldn't attach tty to PPP unit 0: invalid argument
i know i put ppp support in and unixpty when i
installed the kernel help me pleease
