Well, it's something that pro-GPLv3 people can do right now, instead of 
just lobbying/complaining.  Given 1000 developers, if 400 start dual 
licensing now, and down the road some compelling reason for GPLv3 does 
arise (read: a lawsuit with teeth), that's 600 people you need to 
contact/convince to change, not 1000.  This is made more interesting by 
that fact that 40% of the kernel code is already "GPLv2 or later", as 
someone else pointed out.

Well, all my personal (non-kernel) stuff is still GPLv2 only right now 
(Linus' opinion is what convinced me that "or later" is dumb), and like 
many I disliked the original GPLv3 draft.  I'm willing to wait until the 
final one is out though, and I think my libraries will end up being 
dual-licensed, with contributions required to be dual-licensed.  I want 
to avoid v3 lock-in, but I don't want to cripple v3 projects either.

Agreed.
