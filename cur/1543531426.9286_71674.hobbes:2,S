Unless you really have your heart stuck on v0.0.1 then I'd suggest 
going to v1.0.9.  It is still super small (tarball fits on a floppy
with space to spare!) which should make it appealing for school 
research and a while back I hacked on v1.0.9 so that
it would build (and run!) on a more current linux system (like
gcc-2.7.2 and libc5, which was current at the time). You should
be able to find it on linux ftp archives (look for linux-lite).
Paul.
