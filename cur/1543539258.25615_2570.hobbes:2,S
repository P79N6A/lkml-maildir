<p>&nbsp; I think I know what is causing the problem. I have seen this
only
<br>reported for NVIDIA cards and one time for a permidia card using vgacon.
I
<br>also need to to report video cards with XFree86-4.X that work.
<br>&nbsp; What it sounds like that is happening is the gamma ramp is not
being
<br>reset when you VT switch out. When you VT switch out you are setting
the
<br>hardware state from a hires directcolor mode to a pseudo color VGA
text
<br>mode. The gamma ramp alters the color palette on a video card by making
<br>all the color appear to be equally dimmed or brightened. What I think
<br>previously when the console system set the color palette before the
video
<br>mode was changed it was programming on the legacy VGA color registers
<br>which in effect reset the gamma ramp while in a hires video mode. Whereas
<br>now you are setting the color palette once you are in VGA text mode
which
<br>is effected by the gamma ramp. So each time you VT switch the X server
<br>keeps altering the gamma ramp until it makes all the colors black.
Give
<br>the NVIDIA fbdev drivers a try. If the fbdev drivers manage the gamma
ramp
<br>right I bet you will not have this problem.
