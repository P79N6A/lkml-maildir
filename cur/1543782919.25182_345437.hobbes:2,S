Subject: What about adding range support for u32 classifier?

Hello, everyone!
The "range support" may be puzzled, but I don't know how to express my
problem exactly because of my poor english.
Just take an example, I may need all udp packets received on eth0
which source port is greater than 53 going into flow 10:1,  and I only
wanna to type one tc command like this(In fact, I communicated with
kernel directly):
    tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: protocol ip prio 20 \
                                  u32 match udp sport gt 53 0xffff \
                                        match ip protocol 17 0xff\
                                   flowid 10:1
But I found I can't, because u32 classifier doesn't support matching
multi-value in one key.So I need to add (65535-53) keys to a u32
filter to implement this.
I intend to solve this problem by modifying u32 filter to match
multi-value in one key, but I am worrying the preformance.
Can someone give me some suggestions?
Sincerely.
Yuanyi Zhang
