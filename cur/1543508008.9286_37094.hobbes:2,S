All right.  Just in case anyone was looking in to this, I'll mention
that I solved it...  It doesn't appear to have been a linux problem, 
rather it was a BIOS problem.  After reading through the linux-SMP 
faq, I noted that the early Tyan BIOSs were just generally anti-social.  
I flashed a  new BIOS in place and now it seems to work.
A few notes about this problem so it can be more easily recognized
in the future:
The SMP/non-SMP issue wasn't was as clear cut as I first thought;  
It seems to more of a memory layout / timing issue, because I managed
to get a non-SMP kernel to exhibit the same freeze when I used a
different configuration on the same machine.
I'm not absolutely sure that I 'solved' anything.  I may have just 
changed the timing in such a way that it no longer exhibits the 
problem at all...
