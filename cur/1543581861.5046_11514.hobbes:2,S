Under 2.4.1-ac11 I'm getting errors like:
Feb 14 02:10:09 rhino kernel: Unused swap offset entry in swap_count 004dda00
Feb 14 02:10:09 rhino kernel: VM: Bad swap entry 004dda00
over and over.  The system has 512M real and 1G swap allocated.  This
is occuring at:
Mem:    512492K total,   397780K used,   114712K free,     1192K buffers
Swap:   982792K total,   284380K used,   698412K free,   298556K cached
while running imagemagick on a bunch of tifs to convert them to jpgs.
It's the first time I've seen this error.  Is it more likely that the
swap file has gone south or is it indicative of something else?
