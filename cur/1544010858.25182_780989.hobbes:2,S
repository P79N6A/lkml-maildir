the mutex used by cgroup_lock() is pretty crappy to nest inside the 
runqueue lock:
 BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/mutex7
 in_atomic(): 0, irqs_disabled(): 1, pid: 1790, name: cat
 2 locks held by cat/1790:

so i had to remove your patch.
also, while looking at what cgroup_lock does - it's a trivial wrapper:
 void cgroup_lock(void)
 {
         mutex_lock(&cgroup_mutex);
 }
why isnt that done explicitly in all usage sites? If cgroup-unaware code 
ever has to take the cgroup lock outside of CONFIG_CGROUPS, that's a code 
structure problem.
