The cpqarray driver seems to have been broken around 2.5.19 with the
blk_start_queue/blk_stop_queue changes. As-is, cpqarray deadlocks the entire
system when it tries to do partition detection. The bits from the 2.5.19 patch
which seem to relate are:

Simply reverting these changes allows the driver to successfully do partition
detect, but it quickly hangs if any significant amount of I/O is attempted. The
hang in this case seems to just affect processes trying to do I/O on the array;
it is not a whole-system-deadlock.
Test machine is SMP ppro.
