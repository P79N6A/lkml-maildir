My desktop seems to boot a bit faster with adaptive readahead. I setup
a environment running kdm with automatic login plus a kde session which runs
a konqueror window and a openoffice writer windows. The time it takes for
the system to show the OO window went from 1:19 to 1:16 (I did a couple of
test of each kernel). Not a very scientific measurement, bootchart probably
could do it better
