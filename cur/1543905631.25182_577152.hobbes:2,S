Very sorry for the long delay in getting these out, it should be the
last 2.6.21-stable release, unless there are some patches that people
point out to us that deserve a new .21.y release.
This is the start of the stable review cycle for the 2.6.21.7 release.
There are 26 patches in this series, all will be posted as a response to
this one.  If anyone has any issues with these being applied, please let
us know.  If anyone is a maintainer of the proper subsystem, and wants
to add a Signed-off-by: line to the patch, please respond with it.
These patches are sent out with a number of different people on the
Cc: line.  If you wish to be a reviewer, please email stable@kernel.org
to add your name to the list.  If you want to be off the reviewer list,
also email us.
Responses should be made by August 2, 2007, 00:00:00 UTC.  Anything
received after that time might be too late.
thanks,
the -stable release team
