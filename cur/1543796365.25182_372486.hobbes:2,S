s_old_blocksize used to be used to restore the blocksize after the 
filesystem had failed to mount or had unmounted.  Not restoring this leads 
to all sorts of problems since the blocksize may be set for example to 4k 
but some userspace app may need it to be set to 1k or whatever.  There 
used to be applications that failed which is why s_old_blocksize was 
introduced and it used to restore the blocksize.
I have no idea why/when the restoring has been removed but chances are the 
removal was wrong.  Now every file system will need to restore the 
blocksize itself (as it used to be before s_old_blocksize and blocksize 
restoral was introduced).  Except whoever removed the restoration failed 
to fix up all file systems.  )-:
Seems a big step backwards...
Best regards,
	Anton
