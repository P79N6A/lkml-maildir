It differs on type of the  appliction you used. measured values in Linux
shows that x86-64 64 bit app+OS+CPU have performance from 120% to 500% 
of the performance of the 32 bit conterpart
in MS OS it is x86-64   as 80%-190% of the 32 bit MS OS
It is because pointer manipultaion takes longer time because of higer 
width od the 64 bit pointers but 64 bit multiplication is 6 times faster 
no x86-64 system then in 32 bit system and in Windows there is tragic 
memory management tak causes higher pointer manipulation. But there are 
pracitcaly no anothere performance differency in both architectures
Yours faithfuly
