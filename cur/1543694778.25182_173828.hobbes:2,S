Working perfectly here with radeon 9000
I start it without passing any option to the kernel and it guesses the
correct resolution from BIOS (laptop)
radeonfb_pci_register BEGIN
radeonfb: probed DDR SGRAM 65536k videoram
radeonfb: Invalid ROM signature 0 should be 0xaa55
radeonfb: ref_clk=2700, ref_div=67, xclk=16600 defaults
Starting monitor auto detection...
Non-DDC laptop panel detected
radeonfb: Monitor 1 type LCD found
radeonfb: Monitor 2 type no found
radeonfb: Asssuming panel size 1400x1050
radeonfb: ATI Radeon Lf Mobility M9 DDR SGRAM 64 MB
radeonfb_pci_register END
this is actually the first time the radeon framebuffer has worked for me
that's great!
