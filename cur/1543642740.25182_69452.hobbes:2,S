it's locking up here:
416             struct task_struct *p, *reaper = father;
417             struct list_head *_p;
418
419             write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock);
420
421             if (father->exit_signal != -1)
422                     reaper = prev_thread(reaper);
(unfortunately i dont know what happened on the other CPU.)
