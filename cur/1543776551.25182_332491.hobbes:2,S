If you are looking specifically for handling of the ELF format, then you 
have stopped your sequence sooner than it began to be interesting :)
search_binary_handler() then passes, in the case of the ELF object, the 
control to the function load_elf_binary(), implemented in fs/binfmt_elf.c
This is the place where the "execve() process" starts being object-type 
specific.

You will find all this in load_elf_binary() and it's surroudings.
