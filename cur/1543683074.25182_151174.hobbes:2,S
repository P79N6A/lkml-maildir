Actually, you do not need acpi to test swsusp (echo 4 >
/proc/acpi/sleep is the easiest way, but there's syscall to do the
same).

That's okay, ACPI in 2.4.22-pre just replaced older ACPI and
even-more-buggy ACPI in 2.4.21.

ACPI is not much involved. If you want, I can (attempt to) make swsusp
work on your machine....

ohci_stop() does not seem to unregister IRQ...

Okay, thanx.
