Subject: RFC: remove include/linux/byteorder/pdp_endian.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/20/52

include/linux/byteorder/pdp_endian.h is completely unused, and the 
comment in the file itself states that it's both untested and a useless 
proof-of-concept.
Is there any serious reason for not removing it?
