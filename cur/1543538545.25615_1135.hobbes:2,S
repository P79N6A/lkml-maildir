If you do this with 2.4+my patch you'll get sub-2-millisec latency for
the rest of your life.

Sorry, it was bogus.  You can delete a 100 meg file and latency doesn't
go above 300 usecs.   The problem was with returning a huge number of
pages to the kernel - munmap(), exit() and madvise(MADV_DONTNEED).  It
chews 1 millisec per 1000 pages.  This has been fixed, but I'm still
seeing a 4 millisec bump when you do:
    malloc(100 megs)
    play_with_it()
    exit()
This is probably not worth fixing.

Yes, I need to do a streaming-to-huge-file test.  If this makes kswapd
wake up we lose.  Big time.
kswapd can't/shouldn't be fixed with reschedule points.  I suspect there
are fundamental algorithmic problems.  Its job is, basically, to write
stuff on the disk.  I'll admit that my knowledge of Linux VM could be
written on a very small napkin with a very large paint roller, but I
can't see why kswapd should chew 30,000,000 cycles without blocking on
I/O.  We'll see...
