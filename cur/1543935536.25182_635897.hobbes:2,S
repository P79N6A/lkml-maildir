Ah.  That's a brand new requirement.
The requirement which I thought we were addressing was "clean the code up
by adding a notifier chain so multiple subsystems don't need to patch in
hard-coded calls".
  My contention is that the code clarity which this gains isn't worth the
  runtime cost.
Now we have a new requirement: "allow out-of-tree code to hook into these
spots without needing to patch those few callsites".
I think we'd need a pretty detailed description of the pain which this
would relieve before we would take such an extraordinary step.  What are
those (unidentified) add-on features doing at present?  Patching calls into
fork.c/exec.c/exit.c?
