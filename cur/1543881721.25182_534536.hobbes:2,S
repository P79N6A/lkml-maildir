It's not highmem vs lowmem, it is that HIGHMEM64G is required for
X86_PAE, which is required for NX support.

Good thing, since x86-64 doesn't have highmem (nor does it need it,
since it has enough virtual address space to map all physical address
space and still have left over, like it *should* be.)
