Thanks for you reply Keith :)
The reason I asked this question is -- Distro's like RH (i guess it
holds for others too) DONT distribute kernels compiled with -g and
I was wondering why? 
Agreed about the compile-time+disk overhead, but that's ONE time
affair. Analyzing a system-core-dump of a "-g" built kernel (using
MCL's crash) is much easier and fruitful than otherwise.
so is it (just) the disk-space overhead that keeps distributions 
from NOT compiling with "-g" option?!
Thanks once again,
Regards,
A.
