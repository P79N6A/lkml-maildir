I'm still unable to initialize PAS16 soundblaster mode or opl3 mode in
pre3-3.  opl3.c is reading the signature byte as ff in 2.3.99pre,
whereas it reads 0 (as it should) in 2.3.47.  PAS16 mode initializes
fine, but soundblaster never shows up in /proc/interrupts.  Since opl3
never initializes, the playmidi app doesn't find a synthesizer for
output.  All other sound functions on the PAS16 work well.
Maybe I should just give up and upgrade the almost ten year old
hardware, but it has been such a faithful piece of hardware otherwise.
Anyone want to suggest something offline?
