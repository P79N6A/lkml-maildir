Subject: 2.6.28 ext4, xen and lvm volume becomes ro after snapshot

Decided to try out 2.6.28 on a xen VM yesterday.
Used my old 2.6.27 .config as a base and did an "make oldconfig" and
answered any questions that came up.
Everything went fine and the new kernel booted and worked nicely.
Now I wanted to try the new ext4 fs (for no particular reason other than
it being new)
So to start with I tried it without updating the actual fs layout to
ext4, I left it at ext3 and only mounted it as ext4.
That meant adding this to the xen VM config file:
extra = "console=hvc0 rootfstype=ext4"
And also changing to ext4 in /etc/fstab
That also worked fine and I saw that some stuff was being enabled (like
barriers)
But today I noticed that something was wrong with the VM and I noticed
after a while that the root volume was read-only (this VM only has a
root partition).
I noticed the time that the logs were written to last and that was
around the time my backups are being run.
I use a little script that backup this xen VM from xen dom0.
Here is the interesting part of my script:
/usr/sbin/xm sysrq xenfw1 s
/usr/sbin/xm pause xenfw1
sync
/sbin/lvm lvcreate --snapshot --permission rw --size 1G --name xenfw1_s
/dev/3w250g/xenfw1 > /dev/null
/usr/sbin/xm unpause xenfw1
/bin/mount -o ro,noatime /dev/3w250g/xenfw1_s /mnt/snapshots/xenfw1 ||
/bin/rmdir /mnt/snapshots/xenfw1
# Here's where the actual backups take place
/bin/umount /mnt/snapshots/xenfw1 2> /dev/null
/sbin/lvm lvremove --force /dev/3w250g/xenfw1_s > /dev/null
After the "lvcreate --snapshot" if I check within the xen VM (with cat
/proc/mounts) I can see that / changed from rw to ro:
Before snapshot:
/dev/root / ext4 rw,noatime,barrier=1,noextents,data=ordered 0 0
After snapshot:
/dev/root / ext4 ro,noatime,barrier=1,noextents,data=ordered 0 0
It was not possible to do "mount -o remount,rw /":
mount -o remount,rw
/                                                                                      
mount: block device /dev/xvda1 is write-protected, mounting read-only  
I don't see how this could be an expected behaviour so I thought it
might be good to report it here.
I hope I explained the scenario good enough, I can reproduce this if you
want more details (now I'm back on ext3 on this xen VM)
P.S. I'm currently not subscribed so please CC me on any posts regarding
