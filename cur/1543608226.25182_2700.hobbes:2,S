First if you really meant this dev_xmit_nit() (which you added) could be 
removed. But I see no reason for this MUST NOT; IMHO it is a valid use
case to tap outgoing packets.

Packet sockets are a little bit more 'raw' than UDP sockets; and for
sniffing it makes sense and people expect it.
It's also kind of promised by having a PACKET_OUTGOING type.
Now of course if you would be serious with this dev_queue_xmit would 
need to be removed, making it impossible to debug/sniff local protocols
without an external sniffer. That would be of course very broken. 
So it has to be kept. But then allowing it for ETH_P_ALL only is really
ugly imho; if the feature exists it should be implemented for the full
packet functionality which includes binding to protocols.

 When dev_xmit_nit is already there it is easy enough to do it, so no reason
 to add such complications.

 I think the patch should be added.
