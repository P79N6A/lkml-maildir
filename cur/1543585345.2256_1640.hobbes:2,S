I have noiw tried the following
   Diffrent Ram
   No PNP/ Manual set IRQ's
   All bios settings are manual. CPU speed etc
   -X 34
   Diffrent Controlllers ide0,ide1,ide2
Still getting drive corruption as soon as I turn on DMA mode..  I even 
tested 2 HD's and only activating DMA on 1.  (seperate controllers) and 
the both got corrupted. 
any ideas?
