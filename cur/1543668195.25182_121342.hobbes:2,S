Why does it need to check xtime lock ? xtime should be independent 
of the monotonic time because it can be changed. 
Also doing seqlocks around hardware register reads is quite nasty,
because a hardware register read can be hundreds of cycles and you're
very likely to get retries. If you really need a seqlock I would
move it into the low level function and do it after the hardware access.
But as far as I can see it can be just removed.
