Sorry Geert. No disrespect intended.

Damn. Why didn't *I* think of this  ? *smile*
Yeah, I gathered that ASSUME_CUSTOM_KEYCODES relied on the lack of
prefixed scancodes, but I had forgotten that MEDIUMRAW would get rid
of them too. A much better idea, and it does away with the need to
patch the X server (other than the compile time flag for MEDIUMRAW).
Any idea on why this hasn't been accepted as the default way to run
the X server ? It seems like it saves processing time, is simpler, and
works for any keyboard with <= 127 keys (unlike the current default model).
Too bad the Trackman still needs a hack to get the 4th button to work
as intended.
