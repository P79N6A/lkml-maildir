Oh god no, I was afraid you'd come up with something like this :-). I'm
quite sure this will lead to an unmaintainable mess, as more and various
different classes are introduced. Don't try to model something that you
really cannot model.

Lets leave it like it is, and try and tweak latencies dynamically. Could
be used to limit tcq depth, not just request sizes solving two problems
at once. I already have a tiny bit of keeping this accounting to do
proper unplugs (right now it just looks at missing requests from the
pool, doesn't work on tcq).
