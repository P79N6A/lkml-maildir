even in 2.6 not all cards support link state via netlink, it requires some 
updates to the driver. Maintainers should take this as a hint to add 
netif_carrier_on()/_off() or mii_check_link()/mii_check_media()-calls ;-).
This does not hurt for 2.4 as these functions are already available there, but 
do not create notifications in the stock kernel.
