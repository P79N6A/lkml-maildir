I agree.

Very interesting, I had not seen that.   FYI - There are many years of 
real world experience on the current transact2 notify (it is deployed in 
some form on most clients) but I don't know whether one of the NAS 
storage companies or researchers has done a good research paper on this 
topic - although there is no lack of customer traces in SPEC and SNIA.
My gut reaction is that as
1) directory size increases (number of files per directory)
and
2) change rate goes down
(both of which could be client heuristics) the notify mechanism (on the 
directory, or parent directory) is much better, but with small 
directories and more frequent changes the getattr (Transact2 
QueryPathinfo) approach wins.   There is no one-size-fits-all that 
covers both cases.
