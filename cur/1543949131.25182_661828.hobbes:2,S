ndiswrapper contains essentially two drivers in one - PCI and USB.  The
PCI driver uses DMA, which should be a strong argument for keeping it in
the kernel.
As for the USB driver, it may be possible, but some infrastructure may
still be missing.
ndiswrapper needs to register network devices.  For wireless devices, it
needs to be a device with wireless extension support.  I don't think
it's currently possible from the userspace.

Both.  I'm afraid DMA is the real problem here.

I agree that it would be great, but it's quite a lot of work.
