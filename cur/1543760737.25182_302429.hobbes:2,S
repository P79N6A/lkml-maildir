I don't think it works this way - if the system is modifying the pages 
which you're trying to do DMA reads on, you'll just read whatever data 
happens to be in memory at the time. The CPU is not "locked out" just 
because that memory is being read by a DMA transfer.

As above, I don't think anything ensures this. Doing DMA reads on pages 
that could potentially be being modified during the transfer isn't 
something that is typically done..
