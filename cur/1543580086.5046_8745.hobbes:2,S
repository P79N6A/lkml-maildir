Subject: Via PCI IRQ routing problem related? (was: PCI IRQ routing problem in 2.4.0)

hmmm, would these sis-related pirq problems be related to the current
problems lots of people with a via chipset (at least the apollo pro 133a
chipset) and an smp-enabled kernel are seeing?  currently, people with
this chipset and an smp-enabled kernel have to disable apic if they wish
to use usb.  i've been told a few times that it's a problem with pci irq
routing, but have been able to find a fix.  reports of this problem pop
up every-so-often on the linux-usb list.
here's my dump_pirq output:

  PIRQD (link 0x05): irq 12
any ideas?  i also saved the lspci -vvvxxx and dmesg output if that'll
be helpful.
thanks,
