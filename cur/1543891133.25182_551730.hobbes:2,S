That's msi-fix-the-ordering-of-msix-irqs.patch, which is also queued for
the next batch.
"next batch" == around 40 patches atm.  Some of these need maintainer acks
so they will be further delayed, or more likely just merged without the

Found what seems the problem with our vectors being listed backward.  In
drivers/pci/msi.c we should be using list_add_tail rather than list_add to
preserve the ordering across various kernels.  Please consider this for
inclusion.
