yes, you are right and your fix is the correct one. Currently, if we 
define GENERIC_LOCKBREAK on UP then we get accesses to the non-existing 
lock->need_lockbreak field.
[ btw., this is really a small uncleanliness in the generic code: it
  should be possible for an architecture to just enable
  GENERIC_LOCKBREAK unconditionally, to indicate that it intends to "let
  the generic code do this". Then the generic code, when it does not
  have a field (such as on UP), should just not access it. But this is a
  small detail. ]
