Agreed. What I think it should happen is that the userspace library
should focus at the "weird" codecs. E. g. those which uses some sort of
proprietary format. This way, an userspace app may use the userspace
library as a "fallback method" for unknown FOURCC formats. The result
will be probably far away from an optimal result on some cases (since it
probably mean double buffering), but this will at least allow userspace
apps to work. As performance become an issue, the userspace app
developer may use the GPL code at userspace API as a reference to write
a proper optimized format driver for its apps.
Just my 2 cents.
Cheers,
Mauro
