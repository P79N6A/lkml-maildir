I test ppc64 regularly.  In fact -mm is probably the best place to go to
get a working ppc64 tree at present.
But I do not view non-ia32 support as being a 2.6.0 requirement.  I'd be OK
with 2.6.0 working _only_ on ia32.  Other architectures will catch up when
they can.  The only core requirement is that 2.6.0 not contain gross
x86isms which make other ports impossible.
That's a rather lame position, and sure, one would wish otherwise.  Feel
free to disagree ;)
