We must be talking about different things. It of course detects it on
ACK input, but only for data it did send itself. Every TCP detects 
reordering automatically on the input with the sequence number check,
but all we still do is to send an ACK immediately and go into
quickack mode.
Or did I miss something ? 
The only way to do true reordering handling on the receiver I can think of
would be to use something like the soft-timers to do very very fast delayed 
acks even for rcv_mss sized packets and hope that you collect packets from 
all CPUs in the delay, but overall it could still cost you a lot by 
disturbing the ACK clock 
[I talked a lot with Andrea about this during OLS, and we couldn't
figure out a good way]

Web clients probably do not send enough data to make reordering a problem
because the request fits into 1-2 packets and the 3way handshake is not
reordering sensitive.
(I haven't looked at SpecWeb that closely, but has it really any client
sent data that is >packet size?)

Just use __cacheline_aligned instead, like I did with the ip_local_data
in the patch you just rejected. There is still the problem that
generic SMP x86 kernels use a 32byte cacheline. Not a problem
currently because the only x86 SMP is pII/pIII which has 32byte, but
with Williamette/Athlon SMP it'll be a problem because these have 64byte
and 128byte cache lines. With __cacheline_aligned it'll be easy though
to pick up such changes.

I don't think so. There was so much pain to avoid cache line bouncing for 
fast paths, it would be a shame to add it again for silly statistics keeping.

True. 
On the other hand, the inetpeer code is only really exercised on machines
that talk to lots and lots of destinations (=real servers), and 2.4 testing
on such machines still has to begin.
Given that 2.4 testing has not really begun yet I would guess that it is 
safer to remove it now @)
