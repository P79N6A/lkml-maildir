Subject: no /proc/sys ??!?!!

I'm having some strange problems on one of my systems and the only thing
I've noticed that's quite strange is that there is no /proc/sys directory.
i.e. that whole directory tree is missing!  The rest of /proc seems to be
there; alive and well.
Any ideas why this might be?  Anything I can check?  Anything I can do to
fix?
I'm running 2.2.10
Regards,
Kevin
