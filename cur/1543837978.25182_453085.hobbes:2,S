Good to have backups.  It would be very useful to know whether e2fsck
contemplates writing those back as primary BGDs when it's done, but I
couldn't find that in the documentation.  Will it?
(Would be good to have the above information in the docs.  Perhaps in
a "what does this message mean?" section.)
(Such a section would also help a lot when confronted with the first
message: "Entry blah is a link to directory bluh. Clear? y/n".
Obviously I don't want to "clear" my data.  But why is e2fsck
confronting me with that question?  Is something wrong with it that it
should be cleared?)

Thanks for the information!

Ah, I'm relieved.  The sheer number of messages was an indicator to me
that e2fsck is doing something gruesomely wrong.

Much relieved again, thanks.
I'm wondering why it even tries to use the corrupt information, instead of just:
* reconstructing it from scratch
* not asking the user?
That leaves me a little less relieved once again ;-).

Huh?  The user didn't request anything, it always prints.

Even not printing anything would probably be better than knowingly
printing wrong information...

Agreed.  Running a r/w e2fsck on some kind of overlay would be the way
to implement a more useful (for me anyway) version of -n.
But I think dm-snapshot is useless in this case because:
 * It must be configured before MD is configured and the filesystem is
created, which I haven't done on this box.
And generally because:
 * It's rather good at corrupting the filesystems you store on top of
it *itself*...
 * Either you have to create snapshots on devices just as big as the
ones being snapshotted, or you'll have to live with the snapshot
failing any time because it's full.  There's no good management
framework to help you manage the full/failing situations either.
Thanks a lot for the information!
I take it that it's safe to run e2fsck on the filesystem, then...
