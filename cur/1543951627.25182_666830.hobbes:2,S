Andi is correct.
C-states are coordinated in hardware.
ie. if both cores enter core-C3, then the hardware allows the package
to enter package C3.
Package C-states are a big deal -- that is where most of the power savings is.
So preventing all the cores from entering C3 at the same time is
the opposite of what we want to be doing.
