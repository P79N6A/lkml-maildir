If this is the NVidia graphics driver, it's been doing it at least since 2.5.6something,
at least that I've seen.  It's basically calling pci_find_slot in an interrupt context,
which ends up calling pci_find_subsys which complains about it.  One possible
solution would be for the code to be changed to call pci_find_slot during module
initialization and save the return value, and use that instead.  Yes, I know this
prevents hotplugging.  Who hotplugs graphics cards? ;)
