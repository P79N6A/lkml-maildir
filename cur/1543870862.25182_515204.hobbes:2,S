Hi,
I've had some problems with 2.6.20 (but also with earlier kernels, like 
Debian's 2.6.18) where one of the users on our system, running a Java6 
application, is somehow able to make the userspace on the machine totally 
unresponsive, denying all remote _and_ local access to the machine.
- The AMD64 port of Linux and Java are in use
- The process runs as an unprivileged user
- The OOM killer doesn't kick in
- No swap is enabled on the machine
- I'm told that the program doesn't fork bomb
  (but I've not got a reproducible test case yet)
- The program is able to deny service even to a getty login.
If I SAK the machine, init respawns getty and everything is fine again.
