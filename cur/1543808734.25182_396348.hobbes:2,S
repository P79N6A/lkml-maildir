...but which was apparently not repeatable:
        As of this afternoon's tree
        (6150c32589d1976ca8a5c987df951088c05a7542)  after the more
        recent set of nfs patches, it seems to be behaving itself.  Will
        keep sysrq enabled to see if it hits again, though.
I've had no news from Ben since then...
Cheers,
