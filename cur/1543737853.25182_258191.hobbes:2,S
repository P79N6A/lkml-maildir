Note that there already is similar functionality on s390, possibly on
other architectures as well. In kernel/sysctl.c, there is code
to make the behavior run-time selectable. The sysctl is currently called 
KERN_S390_USER_DEBUG_LOGGING and compiled in only for s390, but it might
be a good idea to define this in an architecture independent way, e.g.
with a config option that is always selected on s390, sh and possibly
other archs.
