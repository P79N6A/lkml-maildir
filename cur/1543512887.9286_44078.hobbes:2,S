This may be related to the other notebook problem we're seeing, or it may
have to do with the "free" memory between 640k & 1M.  It would be good if we
could see if /proc/iomem shows use of this "free" memory.  Other than that
region, the whole thing looks pretty much like we might expect.

Ahem, that's 2.3.20 not 2.1.20:
2.3.20 crashes on my 64MB Toshiba 4070CDT immediately after booting.
I don't see much if the framebuffer device is on (blank screen).  But if
it is off, the oops reveals there's a memory allocation problem.
With mem=63M, it boots fine.  2.3.18 was fine without this.
Here is the e820 map printed by the 2.3.20 kernel when it boots
successfully:
	e820: 654336 @ 00000000 (usable) 
	e820: 1024 @ 0009fc00 (reserved)
