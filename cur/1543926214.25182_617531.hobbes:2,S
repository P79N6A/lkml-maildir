The patches you've already queued for stable are all that's needed. 
Including the xfs one, despite Andi's reservations about it; Dave
Chinner has a better fix, but as far as I know he hasn't submitted it
for stable, and the workaround is enough to get things going.
I have one additional patch; I'll send it shortly (once Linus picks it
up...).
