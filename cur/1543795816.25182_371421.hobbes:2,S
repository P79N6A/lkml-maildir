What SATA controler are you using in your box? What does lspci report?
It sounds to me like the driver you are using is not playing well with your
SATA controler or drive.  It could be related to crappy HW or a driver issue.
When you system boots the drive says online and behaves ok?  You just
see device trouble when you boot up correct?
Is it possible to capture the boot messages from a failed boot (serial console,
netconsole)?  It can tell alot about why no root fs was found.  Most likley
no disk were found by the SATA driver.
Thanks,
Keith
