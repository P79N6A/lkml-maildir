I wasn't aware of that, but it doesn't really change the bit order,
only bit names (numbers actually). Extremely weird BTW but I guess
these things weren't that obvious to everyone some 50 years ago.

I suspect the board wasn't able to run any OS, was it? :-)
Would make a real example of the different order of bits, though.
