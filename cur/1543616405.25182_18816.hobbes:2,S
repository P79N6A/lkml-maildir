It works as usual for 512 byte IO (few checks in the code).  I have not 
seen any slowness for < 4K IO. Infact, I can change the patch to try 
raw vary only for iosize > PAGE_SIZE.
I tested with 2 large competing databases, both of them seem to benifit 
significantly from this patch. I tested with 4 different Fiber & SCSI
adaptors, they all seem to work fine. (only on i386).
But unfortunately, if the hardware have special alignment restrictions
(as you mentioned), this patch does not work. I don't know if it makes
sense to make this configurable and expect customer/user to enable this
feature if they know about their hardware/driver alignment restrictions.
Thanks,
