Thank you.  I've been reading the first addition.  is there a second?
the second chapter has a very good explanation of paging and how linear
addresses are used.  logical addresses on the other hand are barely
mentioned.  Segmentation is described well, but the translation of
logical into linear addresses is not described.
I've read elsewhere that logical addresses are comprised of a 16-bit
segment selector and a 32-bit offset.  I thought pointers were always
exactly 32-bits (on 32-bit intel).  where is the 16-bit selector?
Thanks again.
