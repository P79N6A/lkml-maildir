I don't think so, but I notice that bonnie++ Sequential and Random Create 
tests flucuate a lot.  These are on 16384 small files in my tests.

The test against a 1GB (large) file vary somewhat too, but not as much as
the tests above.  The results I posted earlier were the averages from 5 runs.
I just uploaded the raw logfiles from my testing (not just 2.4.17 and radix-tree)
to 
http://home.earthlink.net/~rwhron/kernel
  (the tar.bz2 files are the logs).
