Scroll down to the "Getting Started" section.  You download two files,
uncompress them, and run UML.  The only way I can think to make it
easier would be to make it one file by sticking the filesystem in an
initramfs :-)
For building UML, see

The important thing is to start with a defconfig in order to avoid
config grabbing the host's config from /boot.
