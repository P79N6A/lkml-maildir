When snd-maestro3 (ESS Maestro 3 driver) is enabled, kernel 2.6.21 fails to
boot - it seems to stop at various points depending on what other modules are
enabled. Disabling snd-maestro3 fixes all issues. Moreover, with everything
else being same, using maestro3.c from 2.6.20 kernel and using it in 2.6.21
kernel also works - i.e., system boots fine. I will try to isolate the issue
and follow up.
