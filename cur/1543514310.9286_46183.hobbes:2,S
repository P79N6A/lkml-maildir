Something similar with my box, too.

K6-2-300, no NFS (neither k- nor userland), but restoring the content of
my blowfish-encrypted loop device with tar at that time.

Never had this with 2.2.12 (current /var/log/messages goes back to
8-sep-99, archived version back to 10-mar-99 with no such message),
although I use my crypto-loop-device daily (contains my mail folder).
I changed the following variables yesterday night:
1.) Updated (2.2.12 with international kernel patch) to (2.2.13 with
additional raid0145 from 24-08-1999 for 2.2.11)
2.) Made the transition from mdtools-0.42 to raidtools-0.90 (24-08-1999
snapshot)
3.) re-made my raid-array thus:
# cat /proc/mdstat
Personalities : [raid0] [raid5]
read_ahead 1024 sectors
md1 : active raid0 sdc5[2] sdb5[1] sda5[0] 3146976 blocks 32k chunks
md2 : active raid5 sdc6[2] sdb6[1] sda6[0] 1048832 blocks level 5, 32k
chunk, algorithm 2 [3/3] [UUU]
md3 : active raid5 sdc7[2] sdb7[1] sda7[0] 524288 blocks level 5, 8k
chunk, algorithm 0 [3/3] [UUU]
md4 : active raid0 sdc8[2] sdb8[1] sda8[0] 1573248 blocks 8k chunks
md5 : active raid5 sdc10[2] sdb10[1] sda10[0] 3828736 blocks level 5,
32k chunk, algorithm 2 [3/3] [UUU]
unused devices: <none>
Previously, they were old-style raid0 and linear devices w/o persistent
sb's. The file containing the crypted fs resides on /dev/md5 and is
currently 1.2Gb. I previously resized the crypted fs multiple times with
the ext2resizer, but the current one was created with the size it has
now.
