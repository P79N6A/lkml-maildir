Just a quick note. A per-zone page reclamation
method like this was what I had advocated and sent
patches to Linus for in the 2.3.43 time frame or so.
I think later performance work ripped out that work.
I guess the problem is that a lot of the different
page reclamation schemes first of all do not know
how to reclaim pages for a specific zone, and secondly
have to go thru a lot of work before they discover the
page they are trying to reclaim does not belong to the
shortage zone, hence wasting a lot of work/cputime.
try_to_swap_out is a good example, which can be solved
by rmaps.
