I claim unit volumes with arm, and the majority of the architectures, but
I cannot deny the popularity of i386 and x86_64 with many developers.  ;-)
However, I am not aware of code in the kernel that would benefit
from the compiler coalescing multiple atomic_set() and atomic_read()
invocations, thus I don't see the downside to volatility in this case.
Are there some performance-critical code fragments that I am missing?
						Thanx, Paul
