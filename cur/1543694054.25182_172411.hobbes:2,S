Retu,
I don't mean to sound rude, but you're mail is somewhat incoherent. 
Also, you
have not addressed some people's questions. This really frustrates 
people and
that can cause a potentially useful discussion to go nowhere.
What you need to do is raise or elaborate on _one_ idea per paragraph, have
some sort of introduction or overview and logically structure your argument
from there, stop using parentheses, stop using marketing buzzwords and most
of all, explain specifically WHY your ideas are better than what is already
available in Linux. Don't keep repeating how other operating systems do 
things
unless you back it up with an analysis of WHY it is better than what Linux
has.
Best Regards,
Nick Piggin
