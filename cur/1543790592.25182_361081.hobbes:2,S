Now that you mention it I do remember seeing this patch floating around.

It appears that the NSLU2 only has the flash on the expansion bus which 
is why you believe it's a flash specific problem.

Data coherency can be set on a per 1 Mibyte page basis so all other (APB 
and PCI) peripherals would continue to use address coherency and thus 
would continue to function as they are now.
