I don't know, I'm nor a kernel guru. I noticed that BeOS writes on disk 
when it's idle, without waiting for a 30 sec interval like Linux does.

Not writing all data immediately allow the kernel to merge dirty 
buffers and write them later with less seeks.

What sounds strange to me is that when the disk stops you can eject it. 
It shouldn't be possible as far as the disk is mounted. And when you 
type umount it should start spinning again, write data and unmount... 
Perhaps there's something wrong in the ZipDrive's firmware.
Bye.
