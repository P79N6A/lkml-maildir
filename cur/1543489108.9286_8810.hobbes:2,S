	I had problems with the cmi8330, it works with the sb drivers, but
only with sb 8, when i used snes9x and played games suddenly the game
started to make a horrible noise......no more music, had to restart the
emulator but the problem would pop up again sooner or later, this is
because games usually require 16 bit output sound.....
	The best solution i think there is with the cmi8330 is to use it
with the MSS/WSS drivers......
	Greetings.........
