This is in addition to voluntary preempt U5 . So, first apply up to
Voluntary Preempt U4 , then apply this patch. I'll release for U5 as
soon as it's formally released. 
We are releasing the following new features,
- Architecture independent mutex with priority inheritance. Note, we 
have only tested this in x86.
- Modified latency tracer to trace non-preemptable mutex locking , in
/proc/lock_trace
- Added two new locking functions _mutex_lock_cpu and _mutex_unlock_cpu.
