That is not specifically against this patch, but before we add another 
AES implementation, I'd like to find a better solution for the general 
AES selection.
My original thoughts on this issue are in [1], but this didn't attack 
the problem of CRYPTO_DEV_PADLOCK_AES where it might not be known at 
compile time whether the hardware will be present.

This doesn't make any difference.
I think the former version was better readable, but that's no strong 
opinion.
