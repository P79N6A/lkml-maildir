The ohci_hcd problem should be temporarily fixed by a recent patch to this 
list, from Greg KH (subject: [PATCH] USB: Eliminate wait following interface 
unregistration). This worked for me.
As for the snd_ modules, this is a different problem, which I am still 
experiencing. I have had it with both snd_emu10k1 and snd_intel8x0 - but it 
does not happen every time. I have experienced it on 2.6.5-rc2 and -rc3 (plus 
their -mm patches). rmmod hangs and doesnt respond to kill -9.
Is there any output I can capture to diagnose this?
Daniel
