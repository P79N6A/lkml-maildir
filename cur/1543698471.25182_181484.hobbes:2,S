There even are people using 2.2 on production and/or desktop computers. I
know some of them. Many people jumped from 2.2 to 2.4 because of USB, but
since it was backported into 2.2.18, many people prefered to stick to 2.2.

I second this. I've already tested several 2.5 and 2.6-test, and I'm
really deceived by the scheduler. It looks a lot more as a hack to
satisfy xmms users than something usable. I'm doing 'ls -ltr' all the
day in directories filled with 2000 files, and it takes ages to complete.
I'm even at the point to which I add a "|tail" to make things go faster.
For instance, time typically reports 0.03u, 0.03s, 2.8 real. It seems as
each line sent to xterm consumes one full clock tick doing nothing. I
never reported it yet because I don't have time to investigate, and it
seems more important that people don't hear skips in xmms while compiling
their kernel with "make -j 256" on a 16 MB machine. Second test : launch
10 times : xterm -e "find /" & and look how some windows freeze for up
to 10 seconds... I don't think this is a problem right now. We've seen
lots of work in the scheduler area, many people proposing theirs, and
this will stabilize once 2.6 is out and people start to describe what
they really do with it and what they feel.
Don't take me wrong, I don't want to whine nor offend anyone here. I
think that Ingo and other people like Con have done a very great job
at optimizing this scheduler. I just wish we could choose one depending
on what we want to do with it.
Just my 2 cents,
Willy
