It already does. Currently it supports 2-3 levels, with my patch
it supports 2-4 levels.

For most people it is already generalized (get_user_pages).
The only exception is the core VM and the low level architecture code.
The later will need to deal always with the details.

Nobody came up with a nice automatic iterator so far.
If you look at the different functions in mm/* who handle all level 
they all do slightly different things so it's not that easy to 
generalize. Also it is not that many, perhaps seven in mm/* plus 
another in the arch code.

I don't see us switching to more levels any time soon ...
Also I don't think it's that bad as you're claiming it is. It's a clear
abstraction which has served us well so far.
