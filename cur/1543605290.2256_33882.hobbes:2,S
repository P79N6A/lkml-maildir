It looks like a good start - a lot of things will be cleaner afterward.
A question...
In struct device_driver:
> probe:

What, exactly, does "associate driver" mean?  Filling in the struct device
field, perhaps?  Calling register_chrdev (or register_whatever)?  Creation
of a ddfs entry?  As a driver writer I can understand that the probe
routine should check for the existence of some device, and perhaps set up
an internal data structure.  What else happens?
