You want my .config too ? :)
I tried again from scratch and the kernel is booting without your patch.
Adding your patch with the same config still does not boot. It does not
depend on PREEMPT=y/n.
I added some debug output and it calls __alloc_pages a couple of times.
All those calls get out from the first goto got_pg as expected.
I will try to add some more debug later
