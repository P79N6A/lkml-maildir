Hi,
I got myself a Fury (w/ TVout but that's another story).
Is there any existing patches for that VGA card already ?
Next question, I want to use high refresh rates with that card,
what options I have to add for atyfb !?
Any URLs, docs for easy reading ?
	(I'm already calculating numbers from fb.modes(8) and
		Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt :)
TIA
