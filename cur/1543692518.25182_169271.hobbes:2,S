No, they are not compatible. The resume= command line parameter will be 
trapped by the swsusp code. When using pmdisk, you may set the partition 
you want to use for suspend/resume via the CONFIG_PMDISK_PARTITION 
compile-time option. Or, you may override that using the pmdisk= command 
line parameter. 
I realize it's a bit confusing, but I will write documentation that 
explicitly describes the differences within the week.
