I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.  The point I was
trying to make was against the folks who were suggesting
adding certain metrics to Linux kernel patching.  The biggest
number of reversions script that was just posted pointed at
Linus and Andrew as the biggest villains, or that's how I read
it and that is clearly bogus.
I have had similar experiences with people *paid* to handle
bug reports, requests, etc. and had eerily similar dialogs.  Why
should a volunteer working in his spare time behave any
differently?
What am I missing?
