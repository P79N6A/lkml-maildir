You can dislike the BK licencing all you want, but isn't there some 
misunderstandings here?
I believe you can _use_ any SCM-system you want whenever you want. Using 
bitkeeper in
one place does not prevent you from using it in another company also.  
Neither does using
any other SCM.
The limit lies in that you can't both use the *free* version of 
bitkeeper while also
*developing* some other SCM.  Note that the non-free bitkeeper, the one 
you pay for,
is licenced differently.   So if you use the *free* bitkeeper and some 
employer
want you to work developing another SCM, then you have these options:
1. Quit the job because you cannot legally do it while using the free 
bitkeeper.
2. Quit using the free bitkeeper, by switching to another SCM for that 
project.
3. Quit using the free bitkeeper by purchasing a commercial licence for 
bitkeeper instead.
So, you can have bitkeeper for free with a limiting license, or you can 
pay for an
unencumbered bitkeeper.  Or you can keep your money and not use bitkeeper,

I don't really see the problem here - if they tell you to cease and desist
using bitkeeper, then extract all your source first, before scrapping 
bitkeeper.
Then install some other SCM and get the source tree into that.  It is some
work of course, but not a rewrite!

That's good.  It should mean that nobody can prevent you from switching
away from bitkeeper in an orderly fashion then.
