add_wait_queue()/remove_wait_queue() functions are MP-safe. So for the
'typical' case where the waitqueue is on the local kernel stack you need
no locking at all. The generic rule is that typically all kernel services
are MP-safe (get_free_pages(), kmalloc(), slab, signal sending, etc.) 
[in some cases we use __add_waitqueue which is a non-spinlock version, in
that case we have to make sure to hold the spinlock - the majority of uses
doesnt have to do this]
