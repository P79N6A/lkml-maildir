So?  The number of "real-world" times that this happens is probably
non-existant on a "production" server.  And if you are doing this on a
developer machine, then yes, there might be some slow-down, but no more
than is currently happening with tools like Beagle that people are
already shipping and supporting in "enterprise" solutions.
