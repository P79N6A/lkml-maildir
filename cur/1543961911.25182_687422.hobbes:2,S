yes, please !
i know, linux is an ever moving target, but from my user`s perspective i think the kernel more and more suffers from a quality problem.
the deeper i`m involved in linux and the more i read into lkml or bugzilla, the more bad impression i get.
ok, maybe windows has still more bugs and the transparency of linux gives a false impression, but it`s ridculous that things get broken that often.
e.g. i rarely saw a cd-rom/dvd fail on windows - but i have seen LOTs of problems with that in linux, especially with more recent kernels.
i can somewhat understand why one of my colleagues at work (windoze evangelist, sigh) constantly teasing "nahh, go away i don`t want to grapple with your DIY superstore OS" :)
linux is absolutely great , but please make sure that quality and stability is priority number one !
