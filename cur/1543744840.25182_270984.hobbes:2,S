Third possibility: your test is buggy.  Do you actually use a mutex in
your test when you call pthread_cond_wait, and does the waker hold it
when it calls pthread_cond_signal?
If you don't use a mutex as you are supposed to with condvars, then it
might not be a kernel or NPTL bug.  I'm not sure if POSIX-specified
behaviour is defined when you use condvars without a mutex.
If you do use a mutex (and you just didn't mention it), then the code
above is not enough to decide if there's an NPTL bug.  We need to look
at pthread_cond_wait as well, to see how it does the "atomic" wait and
mutex release.
