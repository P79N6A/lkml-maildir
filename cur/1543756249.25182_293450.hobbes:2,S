Hi!
I have P8SCi motherboard, and I just tried the watchdog with Linux 2.6.10.
I loaded w83627hf_wdt driver, and the watchdog was detected:
WDT driver for the Winbond(TM) W83627HF Super I/O chip initialising.
w83627hf WDT: initialized. timeout=60 sec (nowayout=0)
But it is not working. I tried setting the timeout to 1 minute, and to
8 minute in the BIOS, but the machine reboots after the delay no matter what
the delay is.. the watchdog driver is loaded before the timeout of course.
For some reason, the driver is not working.
I mailed supermicro support about this, and they told me one of their
customers is using watchdog with Debian 2.6.10 kernel. 
So it should work, but..
Is there some patches I could try?
