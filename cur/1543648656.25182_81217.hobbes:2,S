Because ugliness has its price.  As for "highly secure"...  Could we please
see some proof?  Clearly stated properties with code audit to verify them
would be nice.
I'm yet to see a single shred of evidence that so-called security improvements
actually do improve security (as opposed to feeling of security - quite
a different animal).  And in this case burden of proof is clearly on your
side.
What I _do_ see is a lucrative market for peddlers of feel-good "solutions"
that do not make anything secure but have miles-long feature lists that
can be used to impress PHBs.  Now, I have no particular problems with
people who help suckers part with their money, but I don't see any reason
to support them.
3 or 4 patches that might be interesting would be better off without LSM.
The rest...  care to give a hard evidence that it is worth any support?
