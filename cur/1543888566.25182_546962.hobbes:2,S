A lot of newer Intel boards have the IDE interface provided by an 
external JMicron, etc. chip so you may need to enable that driver for 
things to work.
Also, it's unrelated to this problem, but you should check the BIOS 
settings for the SATA controller - you really want to get the controller 
into AHCI mode for best performance.
