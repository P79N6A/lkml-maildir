  I agree that there are more then two levels of "finishedness" in most code,
the kernel included.  Some things are tried-and-true dependable.  Some things
are still not widely tested, maybe a bit shaky, but generally okay.  And some
things eat data for breakfast.
  Usage of DANGEROUS, EXPERIMENTAL, and (null) here seems to parallel more
mainstream computer use of ALPHA, BETA, and STABLE (or PRODUCTION).
  In fact, the kernel releases themselves seem to want to be classified this
way, rather then the two-tier level we have now.  Witness the pre-patches,
"ac" patches, and the "x.y.z has issues, use x.y.n or x.y.m instead"
advisories.  However, as a Kernel List Lurker(TM), I'm not going to suggest a
change in something that fundamental.  Or did I just do just that?  Oh-oh...
