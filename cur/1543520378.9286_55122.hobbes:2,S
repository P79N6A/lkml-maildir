When you see "_R__ver_" in a kernel symbol it is 99.9% certain that you
did not compile the kernel correctly, you have a mixture of old and new
genksym files.  This is especially important when the invalid symbols
are in critical areas like SMP locks and cli().  I strongly suggest
that you clean up, rebuild the kernel, then see if you can still
reproduce the error.
  cd /usr/src/linux
  cp .config ..
  make mrproper (clean is not enough, it leaves genksym cruft around)
  cp ../.config .
  make oldconfig
  make dep clean bzImage modules (or zImage)
  Install your new kernel and modules, reboot.
Also get the latest ksymoops from 
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/ksymoops.
