The ext4 fallocate() patches are dependent on the core fallocate()
patches, so ext4 patch-queue and git tree won't compile (it's not based
on mm tree) without the core changes.
We can send ext4 fallocate patches (incremental patches against mm tree)
and drop the full fallocate patches(ext4 and non ext4 part) from ext4
patch queue if you prefer this way.

I looked at the mm tree, there are other ext4 features/changes that are
currently in ext4-patch-queue(not ext4 git tree) that not in part of
ext4 series yet. Ted, can you merge those patches to your git tree?
Thanks!
Thanks for your patience.
Mingming.
