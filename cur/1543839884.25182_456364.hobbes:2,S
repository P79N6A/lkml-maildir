You cannot create orphan resources with UBC. All resources have an
owner. You might be able to construct a hypothetical scenario where I
commit all my resources to other people but I cannot create orphan
resources or leak them.
Even if I am the only user of a given UBC my counter will survive until
the last object is freed, not until I log out. If I log back in my
resource accounting is still there and nothing has escaped.
