I agree that it is fine.  The thing to remember is that the GPL
prohibits linking against non-source-available components.
However, we're clearly not linking against the firmware (it's
for an i860, not any CPU that the kernel even runs on), it's
just opaque data to the GPL'ed kernel.  Fore has licensed that
this binary data (that they own the copyright to) may be distributed
under the terms of the GPL.
