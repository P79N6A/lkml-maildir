Thanks for the report.
The bug was fairly easy to find and fix.
I think this would be appropriate for the next 2.6.17.x stable kernel,
and definitely for 2.6.18. (hence 'akpm' and 'stable' cc:ed).
It is not relevant for earlier kernels (e.g. 2.6.16).
Patch was made against 2.6.18-rc2-mm1, but applies equally to
2.6.17.7.
Thanks again,
NeilBrown
---------------------------------------------
Fix race related problem when adding items to and svcrpc auth cache.
If we don't find the item we are lookng for, we allocate a new one,
and then grab the lock again and search to see if it has been added
while we did the alloc.
If it had been added we need to 'cache_put' the newly created item 
that we are never going to use.  But as it hasn't been initialised
properly, putting it can cause an oops.
So move the ->init call earlier to that it will always be fully
initilised if we have to put it.
Thanks to Philipp Matthias Hahn <pmhahn@svs.Informatik.Uni-Oldenburg.de>
for reporting the problem.
