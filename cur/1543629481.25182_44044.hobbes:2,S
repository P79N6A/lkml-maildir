If you want to test clustering (or "UML SMP over several seperate hosts"
-JDike) with UML, why not just create a UML kernel with the clustering
support (ie, MOSIX) in that UML kernel?  
Really, I'm just asking what the benifit is to use UML for clustering as
oposed to MOSIX.  I can think of one, testing NUMA without special
hardware...
