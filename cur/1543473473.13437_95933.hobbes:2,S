I've successfully booted 2.2.0-pre1 - it's been up for 22 hrs 37 mins now
with only a couple problems:
* I have IDE & SCSI on my system (root is on /dev/hdb1, while swap is
  /dev/sda1 and home is /dev/sda2).  Under 2.1.131+ac8, the SCSI driver
  (ncr53c8xx.o and friends) would be loaded automatically via kmod when
  the swap partition is mounted.  With 2.2.0-pre1, the drivers don't get
  loaded until /home is mounted.
Ok, so it was only one problem :-)
Beyond that:
* It seems as fast as 2.1.131+ac8
* No problems so far (knock on wood!) with the following as modules:
	floppy
	ppp
	serial
	sound (with true blue SB16)
	100% modular SCSI
	FAT & VFAT + the codepages
My system:
	166MHz Pentium MMX
	64MB RAM
	IDE
	SCSI (NCR53c875-based card)
	SB Vibra16
	Debian 2.0
	(that should be all the relevant hardware)
Be sure to ask if more information is needed.
