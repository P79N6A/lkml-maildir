Sure.  Sorry for not replying earlier.
I don't like the loss of functionality of the private workqueue.  I kicked
the thinkpad led handling to a private workqueue in order to never tie up
the system-wide one with crap spinning around in the ACPI layer, etc.  In
fact, all thinkpad-acpi deferred work is in the private workqueue for this
reason.
This is easy enough to fix, you just need to provide both versions of the
interface (standard workqueue, and private workqueue).  OTOH, if nowadays
the system-wide workqueue runs tasks in parallel and there is no risk of a
task blocking others from completely unrelated subsystems, I can ditch the
private workqueue.
Also, if it is going to be generic, I'd suggest the usual "void *data"
opaque type to carry information for the driver, instead of a "led number".
I didn't see any comments from Richard, but your comment about a flag seems
to imply there was a private one?  IMHO enhancing the led class would be the
best way to go about it, although deferred leds are simple enough that it
doesn't matter much.
