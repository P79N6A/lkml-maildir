> Can you give some more info on your config
Hmm. The more you know about my actual setup the more likely
it is that you'll only fix the symptoms.
But anyway: what happens is that a vortex card starts initializing,
gets the name eth0, but then a 3c509 also takes eth0 and registers
first. The vortex gets -EEXIST.
