This is unfortunately not sufficient, not even close to. If you really want to
have a good idea what is going on you should as well check out what is happening
with packet sizes a lot smaller than 1500 (normal mtu). Check data rate an
packet loss with packet sizes around 80 bytes or so to get an idea what bothers
us :-)
