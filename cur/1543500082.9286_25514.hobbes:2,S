My original posting said why  I was doing this- I've a need to generate at
least a 64 bit unique WWN for a NODE id for fibre channel. This is for
fibre channel ports that don't have assigned (in NVRAM) WWNs. Like I said,
Solaris has a hack that takes the first ethernet mac addr and or's in 1 <<
60 (and controller instance number if you're making a port vs. a node WWN)
for this purpose. I could do this also for Linux, but it raised the
metaquestion of "I need a system unique identifier". Yes, it's a
heavyweight object, but that's no reason to not make it available to
kernel (at boot time too) subsystems that need it.
