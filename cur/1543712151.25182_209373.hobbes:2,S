Where did the blob come from?  If the author wrote it in binary (unlikely),
then it's ok.  If he wrote it in hex (I've done that) he should supply a
hex file from which the blob can be generated.

If the author ripped the blob out of someone else's closed-source binary
driver it certainly is.  It also is a GPL violation.
