Greetings all...
In 2.2.0-pre8, a change was made to the ide-scsi system to ignore
multiple luns on ide devices. This caused my system to hang on boot and
report a command timeout. I have changed the way the system handles
these invalid luns by changing the scsi command result from DID_ERROR to
DID_BAD_TARGET (which makes sense to me) and all is fine now on my
system.
Please CC me in any comments, flames :-), etc as I am not a member of
the list.
Chris
This is a little patch to stop the ide-scsi driver hanging my system when it 
tries to stop multi-lun detections.
