This makes me laugh most of all...
Here's how I'd do it...
ME: "Hey, Joe Newby, I have a Linux box patched up with something called
devfs that will keep track of all your devices and you never need to know
anything about /dev/* and how to mknod new device nodes. But, if someday you
want to, it allows total flexibility."
NEWBY: AWESOME!
ME: "Hey, wouldn't you want to have to create a new device for every USB
mouse/keyboard/PCMCIA device you use every time you use it with no gaurantee
you're going to get it right?"
Forget it.
