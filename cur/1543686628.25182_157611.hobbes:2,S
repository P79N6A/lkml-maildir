As a general rule, you should be using yenta not i82365.  There have
been some historical problems when you build both into the kernel,
so you might like to try disabling i82365.
I don't see any sign of cardmgr starting up in your message logs, and
cardmgr is still required to tell the kernel which resources it can
use, and to bind the driver to the device.
Start cardmgr and it should work.
