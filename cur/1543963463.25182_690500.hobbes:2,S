Ahh, this is what caused the error.  In include/asm-generic/topology.h
cpu_to_node is only defined now if NUMA is turned off.
#ifndef CONFIG_NUMA
/* Other architectures wishing to use this simple topology API should fill
   in the below functions as appropriate in their own <asm/topology.h> file. */
#ifndef cpu_to_node
#define cpu_to_node(cpu)        ((void)(cpu),0)
#endif
...
So before my change arch 'sh' used the default define whether NUMA was
set or not.
An alternative would be to change all the arch's that define cpu_to_node
as an inline to:
#define cpu_to_node(cpu)	_cpu_to_node(cpu)
static inline int _cpu_to_node(int cpu)
{
	...
}
Then include/linux/topology could define cpu_to_node if it's not already
defined.
Andrew or Ingo - do you have any preferences?
Thanks,
Mike
