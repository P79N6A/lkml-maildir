I've got a caveat to my previously posted 'works for me'.  Before I'd
notice that my net connection was no longer moving and then see the oops
in my log if I looked.	With the cvs driver I still tend to see that my
net connection dies sometimes, but no oops.  I've found hotplugging the pcmcia
card brings it back to life.
It seems like I hit this with either driver primarily if I've put my
laptop to sleep earlier in its current uptime.  Is there possibly a
deadlock somewhere around the previously oopsing code and/or the airo_cs
interaction with apm?
