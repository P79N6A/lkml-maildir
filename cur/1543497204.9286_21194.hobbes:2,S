No, please don't. Make it so that it doesn't depend on a particular
group. Even if using a 0-group could have other security implication, 
I am convinced that we should not add some more semantic until
specifically asked.
So, my request: initially, only root (or capability) can bind() to
ports below 1024. IF root echo group > /proc/some_file, group becomes
authorized.
