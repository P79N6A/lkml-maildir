hm, that was supposed to shut itself off after 100 messages:
	if (unlikely(clone_flags & (CLONE_DETACHED|CLONE_STOPPED))) {
		static int __read_mostly count = 100;
		if (count && printk_ratelimit()) {
			char comm[TASK_COMM_LEN];
			count--;
			printk(KERN_INFO "fork(): process `%s' used deprecated "
					"clone flags 0x%lx\n",
				get_task_comm(comm, current),
				clone_flags & (CLONE_DETACHED|CLONE_STOPPED));
		}
	}
I don't see how you got 151 instances.  I guess I'm having another stupid
day.
Oh well.  That's CLONE_DETACHED and I think Ulrich's question just got
answered.
Which distro/version are you running?
Thanks for letting us know....
