I am running Gentoo with a fresh 2.6.11-r1. I have all the kernel 
debugging options turned on. Occasionally, I can get past the boot 
process, but half the time it freezes somewhere along the way. If 
not, I do get to boot, it doesn't take very long for it to freeze.
Any suggestions for how this can be debugged further?
