Ok, I'm happy with this. I'll even apply it if you make a version relative 
to my -BK tree ;).
Btw, there must be something wrong in your size comparison for x86:
	i386 = 524115 bytes
	   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
	5695619  870906  328112 6894637  69342d vmlinux-after
	6221254  870634  326864 7418752  713380 vmlinux-before
The "bss" number shouldn't change as far as I can tell, and indeed, on all
the other architectures you cite, it doesn't change. So I think your
before/after numbers on x86 are something else.
