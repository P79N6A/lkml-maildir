Like renaming the arch/mn10300 and include/asm-mn10300 directories and having
to tell people already using ARCH=mn10300 that they've got to change.

It's also a good time to leave it as is, IMO.  This isn't precisely a new
arch.  It's been around a few years.  It just hasn't been posted upstream till
now.  People are using it, however.

They can if they're told so, plus if they've got the CPU docs to hand, it
should be more obvious.  The AM33 is a variant of the MN10300 arch as far as I
can tell.
