It depends very much on where in the request lifetime you measure the
nr_sectors, because as you've found, the merging code can adjust things
before the request ever gets as far as the driver.

The floppy.c code is looking for sectors which are adjacent _in memory_,
so that it can merge them into a single DMA request.  Nothing more.
