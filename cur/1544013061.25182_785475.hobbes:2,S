Well, everything seems pretty much fine here.. think we'd really need 
the lspci and dmesg output when the problem actually shows up. I'm not 
sure why the BIOS wouldn't have been able to allocate resources for the 
card only sometimes.. The only thing that seems unusual is that you 
don't often see devices with a 16MB non-prefetchable BAR (the big ones 
are usually prefetchable video RAM from a graphics card), and the 
non-prefetchable and prefetchable regions may have to go into different 
bridge windows.. it could be that is tripping up the BIOS.
