I wasn't on the most recent concall, and I've forgotten the details of
any discussion on a previous concall.
Care really needs to be taken here that negative timestamps are handled
properly.  We can take the sign bit from the inode i_*time, but then we
need to change the load/save of the extra time to use a shift of 31
instead of 32.  If we overflow the epoch we have to ensure that the high
bits of the seconds is handled correctly.
Cheers, Andreas
