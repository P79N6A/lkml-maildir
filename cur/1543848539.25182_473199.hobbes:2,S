There's only about 20 users of pci_set_mwi ... about 12 of them seem to
check it, one of them uses a variable called
compiler_warning_pointless_fix which leaves about 7 warnings to be
removed by removing the __must_check.
However, I do believe the __must_check should be removed.  For example,
the LSI 53c1030 has *nothing* to be done if setting MWI fails.  It just
doesn't work, and the device copes.  It's not like Tulip or sym53c8xx
where there are additional bits to be set or cleared in control registers.
