Subject: parallel port problems with 2.6.21_rc5 and 2.6.21_rc6_git3-20070410174235

When using either the unpatched  2.6.21_rc5   or SUSEs patched 
2.6.21_rc6_git3-20070410174235 on a SUSE-10.2 x86_64 system the parallel port 
doesn't work right. If I "cat some_asciifile >/dev/lp0"  the output on my 
Epson Stylus Color 880 is unreadable.  "cat /dev/zero >/dev/lp0"  creates 
random characters on the paper. Printing using cups also doesn't work any 
more. 
Switching back to SUSEs  2.6.18.8-0.1 kernel fixes the problem.
Any Ideas, what might be broken here ?
