I've already heard more about this than I ever cared to. I'll continue
to stick to saner subsets of C and refuse to use things such as how the
preprocessor committing incest with the compiler proper (no, I don't
need it explained to me, it's trivial) allows crappy code to be written.
Don't lecture me; there's nothing to explain and I don't want to hear it.
