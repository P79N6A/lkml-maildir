the 2.4 timer-scalability patches do have a problem: due to TIMER_BH the
actual timer expiry can happen on a different CPU, which opens up a
del_timer()/add_timer() race in the itimer code. Your patch closes that
hole.
But on 2.6 the timer will run precisely on the CPU it was added, so i
think the race is not possible.
