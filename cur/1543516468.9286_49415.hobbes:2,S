<shrug> keeping free(1), etc. happy is _not_ a problem. Now, something
that coredumps 'cause it got -ENOENT... I'ld say what I think of it, but
you can do it yourself, don't you? Look through ktop source, just keep
the barf-bag ready. And then I did, erm, associative search on DN. Results
were not amusing.

Oh, sure.

kernfs is more or less the same as /proc/sys. We can make /proc/sys a
configurable symlink if so desired (e.g. mount option for procfs), but
_that_ is the last of our problems.
Let me put it that way: there is an area where nobody has decent (let
alone portable) interfaces. Doing it _right_ would be nice and if we will
get a clean filesystem-based solution it will not take much to take nullfs
and roll the patches to *BSD. If some *BSD folks will fill the skeleton -
fine, if not - their business. But *BSD lacks the thing just as we do.
libkvm sucks too.
Decent namespace will fix most of our problems - we already have fs-based
solution, but it's rather messy right now. Internal interfaces are getting
more or less straight (we still have a crapload of interesting races, but
they will be the next stage; most of intimate knowledge of procfs guts is
gone from the rest of the kernel and that makes procfs fixes possible).
But the namespace _is_ a mess and implementations of procfs methods are,
should we say it, sometimes unorthodoxal (check what drivers/nubus/proc.c
does. Or ISDN stuff. Or wanrouter). Ideally I'ld see more or less common
format and a tree organised along the lines of buses hierarchy (kernel
being the replacement for nexus ;-). But namespace stuff will go when
we'll have the worst interface problems fixed and will have a list of
animals that want to be there at all.
