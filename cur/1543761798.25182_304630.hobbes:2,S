Ok, this is what I wanted to know.
There seems to be growing evidence that 8250_pci should not claim the
"modem" class, but should match any such cards which do look like
serial ports by vendor/device IDs.  The problem is that dropping the
modem class id match could leave a fair number of people in the lurch,
but I'm game to try it and see.
