Unfortunately bogofilter on vger.kernel.org decided that socket and
timer notifications are spam, so they will not be found in linux-kernel
archive.
One can use kevent homepage instead:

Missed socket notifications description:
# added socket notifications (send/recv/accept). Using trivial web
# server based on kevent and this features instead of epoll it's
# performance increased more than noticebly. More details about
# benchmark and server itself (evserver_kevent.c) can be found on project
# homepage. Splitted patches are available in archive
