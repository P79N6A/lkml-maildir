Hello everyone,
I recently upgraded to 2.6.11.5 (back when it came out) from 2.4.
One of the reasons I upgraded was to get DRM working with my computer
again.
The AGP and DRM modules load fine, but when xdm starts, I have no
direct rendering.
The machine is an ASUS A7V8x-x with VIA chipset KT400.  The video card
is a Matrox G400 DualHead.  I've had the exact same video card working
with different motherboards.
Here is the only DRM output relevant to AGP/DRM:
Linux agpgart interface v0.100 (c) Dave Jones
[drm] Initialized drm 1.0.0 20040925
[drm:drm_fill_in_dev] *ERROR* Cannot initialize the agpgart module.
DRM: Fill_in_dev failed.
Thanks very much for any tips!
