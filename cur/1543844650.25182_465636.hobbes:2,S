Well, since this document states the general consensus quite well, and is 
not likely to be edited other than crossing all the t's, I think including 
them (FSF & RMS) would show them just how concerned the major developers 
are with the deviciveness that the proposed V3, as worded say a month ago 
the last time I read it and was appalled, will cause.  You, nor the rest 
of the fans of a great os, will ever be properly served.
You need to remind RMS that he is not a majority when the vote shows 
otherwise by a quite resounding margin, and that he and the FSF may well 
become irrevalent if the V2 is not going to be supported after V3 is 
final.  Let me put it this way, I would be willing to become a paying 
member of a new organization dedicated to preserving the V2 status if the 
due weren't too onnerous.  If V3 becomes the defacto, then my membership 
in the FSF will get dropped like a hot potato.  I'm just one person, but 
how many other paying members will do likewise?  Enough to cause a serious 
hurt to the FSF's finances I'd think.
