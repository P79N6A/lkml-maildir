Hello, All!
1. 2.4.16 kernel is used on 2xP3-866 SMP machine. There is no
   difference in 2.4.18 
2. 2 problems found:
   a) Kernel threads can be killed under some circumstances. It
      looks like 2 OOMs were triggered simultaneously on different
      CPUs, see records from 18:11:06. The process exited and
      became zombie (mm == NULL). So, on the second CPU kernel
      threads were killed.
   b) Another problem is out_of_memory(). It detects OOM while huge
      amount of free pages is present. According to logs (record from
      18:10:38) there are 100k pages present in all zones and OOM
      still happens. From my point of view, some processes were
      scheduled from try_to_free_pages(). After they wake up, they
      still can't shrink anything as there is nothing to shrink due to
      prevous OOM and a lot of free memory present.
The log below was obtained adding some debug printk's into the generic
kernel code, the patch is attached.
