	Indeed, O_APPEND writes extend the file, and thus need a higher
level of locking.  Regular writes interior to the file should be able to
continue concurrently with the O_APPEND extend.

	I agree that I may be advocating optimizing for an infrequent
case; I prefer to think of it as a clean design. :-) Regarding shared
the use of database files, I note that Oracle can dynamically extend a
shared database file, so there's a possibility that the
extend-while-interior-I/O-is-in-progress scenario might occur
(depending upon how Oracle manages their own internal queuing, of
course).
