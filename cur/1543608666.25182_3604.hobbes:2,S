I have software out in the field that has been around for more than ten 
years.  Some of it has been maintenance-free (other than the 
every-other-fortnight bug report that requires a fix) because the 
underlying operating system didn't change.  Some of it has been a 
nightmare, requiring changes for each OS release and in some cases with 
each sub-release in order to keep the feature bloat from knocking out the 
functionality of the program.
Unlike many of you, my client base doesn't upgrade on a whim.  They stick 
with what works.  That means all my software has to be able to run up and 
down the version tree, and I have a real problem maintaining parallel 
versions of code.  In Linux, I have people on 2.0.34 still.  I have people 
running some of my software on old versions of Ultrix on hardware that 
hasn't seen sales for over a decade.  I just found out that software I 
wrote 20 years ago is STILL in use, and customers were inquiring if I was 
available to make changes!
And then there is the problem of who pays for my time to make the app 
update.  I don't charge people for updates as a rule -- that rule may have 
to change for my Linux apps if this ill-thought-out idea goes into the 
kernel.  I expend enough effort trying to keep up with the crap coming out 
of Redmond and Cupertino.
Apologies for the vent, but I just swatted another bug caused by an 
undocumented change in Windows 2000 that nailed one of my apps but good.  I 
shudder to think what XP is going to look like when my clients start 
thinking of "upgrading" their hardware and have XP foisted on them...
