Yes, but still I think this mb() is not necessary. Becasue we don't need
the "if we saw rcu_mb_flag we must see sum(lastidx)==0" property. When another
CPU calls rcu_try_flip_waitzero(), it will use another lastidx. OK, minor issue,
please forget.

Ah, but I asked the different question. We must see CPU 1's stores by
definition, but what about CPU 0's stores (which could be seen by CPU 1)?
Let's take a "real life" example,
                A = B = X = 0;
                P = Q = &A;
CPU_0           CPU_1           CPU_2
P = &B;         *P = 1;         if (X) {
                wmb();                  rmb();
                X = 1;                  BUG_ON(*P != 1 && *Q != 1);
                                }
So, is it possible that CPU_1 sees P == &B, but CPU_2 sees P == &A ?

Yes, this way we don't need to uglify migration_thread(). OTOH, we need
another kthread ;)
