Subject: [PATCH] [1/1] CPA: Flush the caches when setting pages not present v2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/11/153

The AMD64 pci-gart code sets pages not present to prevent
cache coherency problems.  When doing this it is safer to flush the 
caches too so that there are no cache lines left over from when 
the pages were still mapped. 
So consider clearing of the present bit as a cache flush indicator.
Note that debug pagealloc marks pages regularly not present either, but it won't
call this because it calls directly into a lower level function.
I have not actually seen failures from this, but it seems safer 
to do it this way.
v2: Force WBINVD in this case because CLFLUSH does not work for !P pages.
    Improve description slightly.
