Well, if I use Gimp (GIMP version 1.0.1) with the X shared memory
extension (XFree86 Version 3.3.3.1) on my Alpha PC164 then after a while X
crashes..  If I use Gimp's --no-xshm option I can run it all day.
Just a data point, but if there's some Magic SysRq or other prog I can
run (the system's still live -- I can telnet to it from elsewhere, though
the consoles crash -- I can't Ctrl-Alt-F2 after X dies) to probe the
shared memory I'd be happy to test it.
