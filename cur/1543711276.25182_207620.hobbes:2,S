To keep the name, he needs to update all callers, right?  Current patch
appears to add a static inline for security_vm_enough_memory that
retains the old interface to avoid having to update most callers.
I don't have any fundamental problem with the nature of the change.  As
a side note, patch was malformed (at least as I received it), not sure
if that was just a problem on my end.
