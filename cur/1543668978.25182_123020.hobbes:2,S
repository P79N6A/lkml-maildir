I've a similar hang; no oops; no sysrq; no NMI messages;
But mine only happens under 2.5; since long time ago.
The one strange thing is that it seems that it's not hanged;
since the X pointer moves in 3-5 seconds intervals (it even
change the shape in the window's corners).
It happens without X too; but as i said nothing survives...
no oops, sysrq, nmi messages, doesn't answer to pings...
I know by the fans' sound that the cpu usage goes to 100%
I'm thinking of a hardware failure too (but the odd X behaviour makes
me hesitate); since i don't remember that it failed under 2.4 that i
remember of...this box didn't run a lot of 2.4 kernel though.
The box passes memtest86; it's
 a 2x800 box, ide disk, 256 ram;
VIA chipset...just in the (very strange) case that somebody
has exactly the same box and they have/don't have the same problems.
