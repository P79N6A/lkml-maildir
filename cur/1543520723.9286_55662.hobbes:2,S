More details please, my telepathy mode is not working tonight.  Do the
USB modules get installed in /lib/modules/2.3.35?  Does depmod -ae
complain about unresolved references for these modules?  Does modprobe
or insmod on a USB module give any errors?  or is the problem that
nothing is asking for the modules to be loaded?
ps. Tell your bosses that I am not buying any more books from Amazon while
    they persist with their "patent" on one click shopping.
