I did prototype something like this, using a field called dma_accessors that 
was basically a platform opaque set of function pointers.
I ultimately came to the conclusion that these functions couldn't be per 
bus_type, they had to be per bus instance.  Finally, it just seemed easier to 
load this information into the platform_data field of the generic device and 
let the implementation handle it instead of exposing it explicitly in the 
model.

I'd rather hide the range of possible memory types from the drivers.  I think 
all a driver needs to know is that the memory is fully consistent, or it isn't 
(and if it isn't, the driver has to put the full syncs in, the implementation 
decides if they really correspond to anything).
By and large, most drivers just want to specify CONFORMANCE_CONSISTENT, so 
that they don't have to bother with the sync points.

I'm dubious about efforts to unify io space and memory space.  I think the 
semantics are just too different.  However, if someone else wants to lead the 
charge...

I think that's queued somewhere in Patrick Mochel's pile for inclusion.
