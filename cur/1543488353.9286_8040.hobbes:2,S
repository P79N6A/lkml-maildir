Sort of.  There are a few reasons why this isn't generally done:
1. Multi-segment stuff complicates the kernel and introduces some
   portability issues
2. Protection can be set on a per-page basis anyway
3. It doesn't close holes - search your local bugtraq archive for "return
   into libc".  Basically instead of overflowing with code, you send a
   stack frame for your favourite library (or program) function and return
   into that instead
4. It does break some existing binaries.

Linux does, and I think most other Unices do too.
