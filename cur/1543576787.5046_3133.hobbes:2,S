Chris, this was an error, I had accidently booted the wrong kernel.  The
'With patch' results above are for 2.2.16, not your patch.
With correct results you are looking much better:
      Test machine: 64 meg, 500 Mhz K6, IDE, Ext2, Blocksize=4K
      Test: dbench 48
      pre13 without patch:	9.5 MB/sec 	11 min 6 secs
      pre13 with patch:		8.9 MB/sec 	11 min 46 secs
      2.2.16:			3.1 MB/sec 	33 min 51 sec
This benchmark doesn't seem to suffer a lot from noise, so the 7%
slowdown with your patch likely real.
We've come a long way from 2.2.16, haven't we?  I'll run some of these
tests against 2.2 pre19 kernels and maybe fan the flames of the 2.2/2.4
competition a little.
