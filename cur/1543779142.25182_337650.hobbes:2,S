Yeah I agree, it would be extremely useful and simplify for people
who don't have git installed.
Linus, do you think we could have something like
patch-2.6.13-rc4-incremental-broken-out.tar.bz2 that could like Andrew's
be placed into patches/ in a tree?
So for example, have a tree with 2.6.13-rc3, download
patch-2.6.13-rc4-incremental-broken-out.tar.bz2, place it in patches/ and 
be able to do quilt push / quilt pop easily.
As it stands today it's easier for us who don't know git to just find
out in which mainline kernel it works and which -mm it doesn't work in,
get the broken-out and start push/pop. And I know I'm not the only one
who has noticed this.
Thanks
Alexander
