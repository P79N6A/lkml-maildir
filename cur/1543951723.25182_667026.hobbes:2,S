Sorry to ask here, but I looked around for quite a while on the web.
Is the size of the buffercache in any way constrained by the amount of
virtual memory space allocated to the kernel (when using a PAE kernel)?
For example with a 1G/3G split and 8G of physical memory, if userspace
processes aren't interested in more than 6G of that memory, would the
kernel fully utilize all of the remaining 2G for buffercache?
