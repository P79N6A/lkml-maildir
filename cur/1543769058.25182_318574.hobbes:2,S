This is because there is a PCI memory hole of about 1GB of space on the 
x86_64 platform. Basically it overlays the address space of the RAM that 
you have.
You can try to enable memory hoisting (it may be called software memory 
hole in your bios). This will try to remap you RAM above the 4GB 
boundary so that the PCI space and your RAMs address space do not 
conflict. Unfortunately, this does not work particularly well...
