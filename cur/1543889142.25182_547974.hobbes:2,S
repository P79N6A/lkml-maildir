No, I haven't made it clear. A known number (default four) of xterms are 
started, each of which calculates random numbers and prints them, using 
much CPU time and causing a lot of scrolling. At the same time glxgears 
is running, and the smoothness (or not) is observed manually. The script 
records raw data on the number of frames per second and the number of 
random numbers calculated by each shell. Since these are FAIR 
schedulers, the variance between the scripts, and between multiple 
samples from glxgears is of interest. To avoid startup effects the 
glxgears value from the first sample is reported separately and not 
included in the statistics.
I looked at your results, and they are disturbing to say the least, it 
appears that using the ck2 scheduler glxgears stopped for all practical 
purposes. You don't have quite the latest glitch1, the new one runs 
longer and allows reruns to get several datasets, but the results still 
show very slow gears and a large difference between the work done by the 
four shells. That's not a good result, how did the system feel?

Thank you, these results are very surprising, and I would not expect the 
system to be pleasing the use under load, based on this.

It's really the relative work done by identical processes, hopefully 
they are all nearly the same, magnitude is interesting but related to 
responsiveness rather than fairness.

Well, top or ps will give you a good idea of processing, but it tried to 
use all of one CPU if allowed. Again, similarity of samples reflects 
fairness and magnitude reflects work done.

Everyone seems to like ck2, this makes it look as if the video display 
would be really pretty unusable. While sd-0.48 does show an occasional 
video glitch when watching video under heavy load, it's annoying rather 
than unusable.
Your subjective impressions would be helpful, and you may find that the 
package in the www.tmr.com/~public/source is slightly easier to use and 
gives more stable results. The documentation suggests the way to take 
samples (the way I did it) but if you feel more or longer samples would 
help it is tunable.
I added Con to the cc list, he may have comments or suggestions (against 
the current versions, please). Or he may feel that video combined with 
other heavy screen updating is unrealistic or not his chosen load. I'm 
told the load is similar to games which use threads and do lots of 
independent action, if that's a reference.
