..the A above is dnotify by itself.  All I said--and I don't know why
anyone questioned it--is that I want to put dnotify's configurability in
the inotify patch.  They make sense together, and the patches conflict
anyways.  I can do this.
CONFIG_DNOTIFY makes sense either way, on its own or (more so) with
inotify, and I already posted the patch separately.
Why are we even talking about this?!?
