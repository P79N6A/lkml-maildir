You don't _have_ to --- the alternative is to have synchronisation
markers in the signal stream which let you syncronise signals with other
activity like accept().
You can always place those markers into the siginfo stream yourself via
sigqueue().  Otherwise, you have to distrust siginfo's somewhat.
Neither of these alternatives requires kernel modifications.
