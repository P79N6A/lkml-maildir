So this patch is an obvious bugfix - please apply, and to stable as 
well. I'm not sure when this broke, but taking interrupts in the middle 
of self modifying code is not a pretty sight.

Interrupts must be disabled during alternative instruction patching.
On systems with high timer IRQ rates, or when running in an emulator,
timing differences can result in random kernel panics because of
running partially patched instructions.  This doesn't yet fix NMIs,
which requires extricating the patch code from the late bug checking
and is logically separate (and also less likely to cause problems).
