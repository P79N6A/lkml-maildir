Ass yourself for hours, each time risking making a typo and killing both
filesystems, or risking having the LVM resize die from a powerdrop or a kick
to the power button (sorry we don't all have immortal fault tolerance).  I actually
though about this one and figured it was too rediculously annoying to actually
bring up :-p

I've never used LVM, but I'll look at it one day.  If it's stable, that's good; I
don't use Windows.  I don't know exactly what LVM is but I have a pretty
good idea; it's been forever since I read the doc on it, I forgot what it said!
