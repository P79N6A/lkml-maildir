Hi!
Is it goign to be implemented in linux-acpi?
I took a look at specs at intel, and it has rather funny legaleese:
 LICENSE. Intel grants you a copyright license to download the Draft
Specification from the Site and make copies of the Draft Specification
subject to these conditions:
1. You may not copy, modify, reproduce, disclose, rent, sell,
distribute, transmit or transfer all or any part of the Draft
Specification except as provided in this Agreement, and you agree to
use reasonable efforts to prevent such actions for any copy of the
Draft Specification that you have received subject to this Agreement.
2. You may not transfer, transmit, distribute, publish, or publicly
display the Draft Specification in whole or in part without the
express written permission of Intel.
3. You may make copies of the Draft Specification for your own
internal use for the purpose of review and providing comments or
suggestions to Intel. This "Draft Specification License Agreement and
Disclaimers" must be included with and all copies of this Draft
Specification you make.
Of course I'm going to modify the specification. Probably print it on
the paper and burn it.
Intel puts specs on the web and then asks me to use "reasonable
efforts" to prevent further copying? WTF?!
I should copy their stupid legaleese for any copy for my use?!
Intel, kill your lawyers,
								Pavel
