Please instead use a second argument 'gfp_high', which will nicely
match zone_watermark_ok, and use that consistently when converting
__alloc_pages code to use get_page_from_freelist. Ie. keep current
behaviour.
That would solve my issues with the patch.

How? Why? This should be solved because a future possible feature
(early allocation from pcp lists) will want inlining in order to
propogate the constant 'replenish' argument.

Slight patch mis-split I guess. For the cleanup patch, you're right,
this should be removed.
