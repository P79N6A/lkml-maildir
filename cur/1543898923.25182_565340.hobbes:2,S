Yes, that will make the suspend/hibernation less reliable in case the resume
fails (some data, written after the sync, may be lost).  However, the sync done
from within the freezer doesn't guarantee that there are no data lost anyway,
so we don't lose much by not doing it.
Now, there's a question how much data may be lost, potentially, if we do the
sync before the freezer and I don't think that's a lot.
