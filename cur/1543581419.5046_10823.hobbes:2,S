I found no way of measuring the PCI speed than by doing an IDE PIO
transfer unfortunately. Measuring all other PCI transactions gives bad
results, because it is dependent on waitstates and other variables.

Not the case, sorry. An IDE drive is needed. However, it still might be
worth to pass the PCI speed to other drivers ...
