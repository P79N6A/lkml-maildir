The current "core" console code screen_buf layout is designed after VGA 
text mode. 16 bits which only 8 bits are used to represent a character, 9 
if you have high_fonts flag set. The other 8,7 bits are for attributes. 
This is very limiting and it does effect fbcon.c :-( I like to the console
system remove these awful limitation in the future. This why I like to see 
fbdev drivers avoid touching strings from the console layer.
