If you move the call to shm_getname into lock_kernel/unlock_kernel,
you can be sure that by the time anything can access /var/shm,
shm_sb->s_root->d_covers will be valid. Maybe add a comment to
sys_mount to make sure that anybody trying to remove the big kernel
lock knows that they have to give shm another lock instead.
Probably a bit inefficient for sys_shmat, but then it's probably not
the type of system call that gets invoked a thousand times per second
anyway.
I think there are worse kludges in the kernel ;-)
