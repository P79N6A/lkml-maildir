Yep! That's right! When I disabled DMA on hd, two 'broken' kernels were
able to wake up it - 2.4.19pre4 and 2.4.20pre10. So IMHO problem is
solved. I'm just curious what changed in 2.4.19pre3-4 that it caused this
problem and at the second I have classical i440BX + PIIX4 ide.
Anyway, thanks a lot,
Cheers,
Karel
