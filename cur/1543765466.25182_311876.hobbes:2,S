You tell me a better[1] 32bit GigE PCI adapter than Intel E1000
and I sure do this. It's pretty interesting to see that those
who buy some not-so-cheeep hardware are being screwed in this
case; it should be in Intels best interest to help fix this
issue ASAP and permantently for all users.
[1] better performance at less CPU utilization + good diagnostics
     and negotiation capabilities
Servus,
