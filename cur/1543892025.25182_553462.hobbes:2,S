This is not supposed to happen with robust futexes.
glibs aborts (which is correct), or for build with disabled debugging
enters simulated deadlock (which is confusing).

Yup. You are right.
This means those RETRY messages could be spurious. I must rerun the test.

Because right curval is refetched, it already has FUTEX_OWNER_DIED bit set
and we succesfully take the lock.

Of course. It is the only place where ret is set. :-)

This case.

OK.
You need run only tst-robustpi8 in loop. It should be triggered quickly,
a few of minutes on 8-way smp here.
If you want, I can insert some debugging printks, which you need,
and run the test here.
