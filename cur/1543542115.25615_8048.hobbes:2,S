You need modutils 2.3.13 to match the kernel changes so
Documentation/Changes is correct - for the kernel.  People with broken
entries in modules.conf where you incorrectly tell modutils to scan
*all* of /lib/modules/<version> need modutils 2.3.14.  Strictly
speaking this is user error but modutils was upgraded to shield users
from their own mistakes.  modutils 2.3.15 includes some compile and
install fixes so if you are going to upgrade, grab 2.3.15.
