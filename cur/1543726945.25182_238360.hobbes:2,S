Hm...
11514     6.7783  fget_light (vanilla)
13168     7.7224  fget_light (rwlock)
1993      1.2633  fget_light (kref)
Total ticks -
169886  (vanilla)
170520  (rwlock)
157760  (kref)
Of the 12126 ticks that were reduced by kref, 9521 came from 
reduction in fget_light(). So, lock-free fget_light() does help.
Also, it seems the lock contention is not much of an issue -
1203      0.7082  .text.lock.file_table
That explains why rwlock didn't help. I guess we are benefiting
mostly from avoiding the cacheline bouncing and removal of the
lock acquisition.
Thanks
