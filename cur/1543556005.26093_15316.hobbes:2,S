It's not "an Olivetti", it has a model number and God Knows What.
From the looks of it they are using a 440FX chipset, which definitely
does not have this problem inherently (and almost certainly handles
port 92h correctly), so whomever wired up this motherboard was even
more of an idiot that I first thought.
If I were you I would take it back and demand a refund.  It isn't a PC
you have there.
