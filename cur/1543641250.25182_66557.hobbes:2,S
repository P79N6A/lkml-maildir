You're misunderstanding me, I meant that the  first test is done AFTER the first iteration is 
executed, so my fix is correct since, even if order is 0 because at least one iteration of the loop 
is done, and the post decrement makes sure that the test succeeds if order was 0 going into the 
loop.
Changing order to a signed long loses half of the cache entries due to the number being divided by 
2.
