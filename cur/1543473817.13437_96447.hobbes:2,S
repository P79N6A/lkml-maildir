I got the AWE32 working very nicely with the awe_wave module, but it
turned out to be harder to get the Gus PnP working as per the
instructions in Documentation/sound/ultrasound.
Am I doing something wrong, or is this a problem with the driver?
1. The card has been initialized with isapnp.
2. Loading the modules (modprobe, insmod * 2) works, and says
   ad1848/cs4248 codec driver Copyright (C) by Hannu Savolainen 1993-1996
   Gravis Ultrasound audio driver Copyright (C) by Hannu Savolainen 1993-1996
3. cat sound > /dev/dsp works
4. playmidi doesn't work, it says "playmidi: No playback device found."
5. Now, doing
   rmmod gus ; rmmod ad1848 ; rmmod sound ; rmmod soundlow ; rmmod soundcore
   says "rmmod: soundcore: Device or resource busy"
6. dmesg says "Sound device 16 went missing!"
/etc/conf.modules contains:
  alias synth0 gus
  options gus io=0x220 irq=12 dma=5 dma16=7 type=1 no_wave_dma=1
/dev/sndstat:
Load type: Driver loaded as a module
