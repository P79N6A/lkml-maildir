They exist only for exec - since within just a fork() the situation
is under your control. It is your fault if you forget to close() it - the
kernel isnt there to baby you - and if you want it to you can write a nice
fork wrapper that asks the library to close handles it is using.

FD_CLOFORK is the logical way to do it so that it matches FD_CLOEXEC. Think
hard about the semantics for threaded applications where they share the
same file handles when doing this.
