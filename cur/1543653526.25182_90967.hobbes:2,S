Hello,
I had nearly the same problem in april. The linux-kernel found the
raid-controller and detected the devices at startup but I couldn't fdisk
these devices or just find the controller after startup.
It's a HPT372 here.
I couldn't solve the problem but will try it soon again. If you find the
solution, let me know.
Gruß
Uli
