Well, i tried the altered values that you suggested to me but nothing
changed. 
More specifically i used the following values at the lilo prompt:
1) LILO: <kernel_name> ide2=0xb000,0xb406 ide3=0xbc00,0xc006
2) LILO: <kernel_name> ide2=0xb000,0x0 ide3=0xbc00,0x0
and 3) LILO: <kernel_name> ide2=0xb000 ide3=0xbc00
Also i tried without parameters and it does not work!
At the boot process the following appears with 2 & 3 from the above
values:
HPT366: onboard version of chipset, pin1=1 pin2=2
HPT366: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 98
HPT366: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide2: BM-DMA at 0xb800-0xb807, BIOS settings: hde:DMA, hdf:pio
HPT366: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 99
HPT366: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide3: BM-DMA at 0xc400-0xc407, BIOS settings: hdg:pio, hdh:pio
hde: probing with STATUS(0x50) instead of ALTSTATUS(0xff)
hde: ST328040A, ATA DISK drive
hdf: probing with STATUS(0x00) instead of ALTSTATUS(0xff)
hdf: probing with STATUS(0x00) instead of ALTSTATUS(0xff)
ide2 at 0xb000-0xb007,0xb206 on irq 15
Of course when i tried to fdisk it then:
[root@Jufis /root]# fdisk /dev/hde
Unable to open /dev/hde
Trying with hda:
[root@Jufis /root]# fdisk /dev/hda
Unable to open /dev/hda
Any further comments or sugestion are valuable.
TIA,
