The VGA text mode hardware has an attribute for the background.
This attribute normally is "flash" so when set, you'll get the
standard foreground color + flashing.  If you want 16 background
colors, you need to change it so that it interpret's the
attribute bit as highcolor instead.  I don't remember how this is
done, but I think it can be done either by echoing something to
the console, or by "setterm".
This is how programs like Norton Commander get 16 color
background colors.
I'll leave the details for someone else...
