ipc/mqueue.c should be rewritten to use vfs_path_lookup instead.
nfsd is special - people need to deal with the !nameidata or !intent
case anyway because the fs/exportfs/expfs.c code uses lookup_one_len
all over when the filesystem is mared nfs exportable, but fortunately
the filesystem that are nfs exportable are usually not those using
intents.  We might eventually fix this one day by having some kind
open by handle intent, but that should come as part of a large
patch series where we qualify the type of lookup for every single
lookup.
