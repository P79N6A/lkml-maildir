You have way to much faith in the hardware.  Promise is especially known 
for not keeping to the spec.  I wouldn't trust the interrupt bit to be 
valid unless a dma is actually active, i.e. that
                  hwif->OUTB(hwif->INB(dma_base)|1, dma_base);
has actually been written.  
I've actually had a manufacturer tell me that they don't worry about the 
spec, just making things work with Windows.
