The attached patch is an *absolute* prerequsite for any attempt to
target
the overuse of the kdev_t in the kernel as well as for any serious
attempt
to provide wide major/minor as well as raw device support.
I think it speaks best for itself. Since it's clean it should be
applyed to the current developement kernel.
Yes I'm still revolvig around the kdev_t problem and this is one of
*many*
migration steps, which will unfortunately have to touch neraly every
single "damn" 
block-device driver out there. But there is no good way around this
without
making the current "mess" even worser... so one should start as soon as
possible.
OK that's it please have a look at it.
Thank's in advance.
PS. (Supposedly the tediousity of it was the main reason why nobody
actually did this
during the past 7 years before ;-).
