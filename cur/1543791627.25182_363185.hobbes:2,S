Hmm, good catch. That slipped through us - and to be hoenst, I have no
explination other than, it's wrong. ecryptfs_write_headers should not
be responsible for put'ing that which it did not get.
I'm wondering if I should be sending 1 patch per tiny fix like this,
or if I should be waiting for a few more changes, so as to not flood
the threads with minor patches?
Thanks,
Mike
