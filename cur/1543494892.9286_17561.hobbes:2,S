Linux cannot perform IO on such memory right now.  End of story.  It
will in the future: this is just one of a whole raft of related problems
we have due to the backwards-compatible way virt_to_phys works.

Yes, that's the one, but this change breaks a number of other device
drivers.

Correct.  __va and __pa use arithmetic which is fine for pure memory
operations but which breaks some IO operations due to ISA memory region
backwards compatibility.  We'll be fixing this in 2.3.

Such a leak wouldn't by itself lead to slab corruption.

Given that you are treading in completely  untested waters by breaking
virt_to_bus and by doing dma from PCI space, it's hard to debug this
remotely!
