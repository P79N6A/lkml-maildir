I would have had to get down, sort out what the heck is happening,
completely review and test these patches.  It's not a thing which
I want to be spending time on now.
If someone wants to send me a complete, documented and well-tested patch
then I can drop it in for testing, with a view to merge post-2.6.0.
(I'm also not particularly happy about adding eight(sixteen) bytes to every
inode just to speed up unmount.  It's worth thinking about alternatives,
although there are few).
