I agree, but
- Ingo molnar noticed a 4 % speed-up with lmbench - IMHO this means that we
should try hard to use the optimization.
- it's a CPU semaphore, ie a bad PCI card cannot cause any problems.
- both CPU's are very similar [Intel says that both should have the same
stepping, and the list of supported combinations with different steppings is
short]
