Using an UP kernel with IO-APIC support and MPS 1.4 they don't share irqs:
           CPU0       
  0:   66083638    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:        828    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  4:          3    IO-APIC-edge  serial

I've tried changing slots aswell and I havn't seen any improvments with
either MPS 1.1 or 1.4
