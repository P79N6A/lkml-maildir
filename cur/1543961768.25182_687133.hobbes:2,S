Thanks...
So, we need these complications to avoid a false positive from lockdep...
I wonder if it is possible to simply hide this internal mutex from lockdep.
OK, at least get_online_cpus() doesn't suffer from the performance pov,
and lockdep is really important. (I didn't actually understand this until
it found the bug introduced by me ;)
BTW, not that it matters, but get_online_cpus/put_online_cpus can check
"cpu_hotplug.active_writer == current" lockless.
Thanks!
Oleg.
