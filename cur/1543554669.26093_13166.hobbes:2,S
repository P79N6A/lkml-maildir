Subject: EJECT ioctl fails on empty SCSI CD-ROM

Apparently using the CDROMEJECT ioctl with kernel 2.4-testX fails on
a SCSI CD-ROM that does not have a disc in it.  The errno returned
corresponds to the string ``No such file or directory.''
The Linux CD-ROM Standard states that CDROMEJECT opens the drive tray.
It does not mention any prerequisite such as media being present.
Is this the expected behavior?  If so, I am curious to hear the rationale
behind it.
Thanks!
