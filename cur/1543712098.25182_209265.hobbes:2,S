Of course if you do have 8M memory, you're not going to care about
suspending to disk anyway :>. Note too that suspend2 will eat memory
until it can suspend. It doesn't livelock because it grabs the memory it
frees immediately and if it can't free enough, it gives up and exits
cleanly. You'll know almost instantly if your suspend is going to
succeed or fail: once you start seeing the image written, the only thing
that will stop it is media/hardware failure or user intervention.
