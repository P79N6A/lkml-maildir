Hahah that's hilarious.  I really like the idea, by the way, of this
sigopen() feature.  An inverse of that owuld be to map existing file
descriptors to signals, that way an application doesn't have to explicitly
select() on them, but rather can install a very asynchronous fd reader for
whenever the data is available.  I am not sure how useful this would be,
but in the case of asynch. cdrom events it would be useful.  :)
Also, why did the author of this manpage seem to complain about
conflicting signals?  You can always find out what signals your process is
waiting for....
