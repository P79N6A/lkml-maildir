   Sure.  But do it correctly and perform a tlb flush higher up in the page 
   table walking code.  Just deleting it entirely is bogus.  Introducing 
   hard to track down bugs is just stupid.
It isn't a bug, the referenced bit is a heuristic.  The referenced bit
being wrong cannot result in corrupted user memory.
Franks a lot,
