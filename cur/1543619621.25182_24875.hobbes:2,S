Can anyone guide me in choosing the appropriate port of Java for Linux
2.4.17 and glibc-2.2.2-10
Which is the best of the three?
Blackdown Java
IBM JAVA
Sun Java
I have heard that Blackdown supports native threads...while IBM and SUN do
not!!
Any kind of help will be greatly appreciated.....

anyone guide me to an appropriate mailing list
Thanks,
Anish
