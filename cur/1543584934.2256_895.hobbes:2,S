What I mean that too many factors are affecting the enumeration,
so that you can not rely on it :
-  kernel changes
-  driver changes ( partly overlaps with the previous poit )
-  hardware changes
-  something else ?
There is no policy for this enumeration ( AFAIK ) , so there is
nothing to rely on , except luck :-)
