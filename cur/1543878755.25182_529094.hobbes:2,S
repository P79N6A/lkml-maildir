Nope, it's not.  At least for SATA (your chosen examples), hotplug is 
handled by a libata-specific thread.
The SCSI EH threads are there purely for SCSI exception handling.  For 
the majority of SAS and SATA, we replace the entire SCSI EH handling 
code with our own, making those threads less useful than on older (read: 
majority) of SCSI drivers.
