valgrind only breaks when you decrease TASK_SIZE to 2GB, not when you
enlarge it. In general 2GB VM breaks a lot of apps, that is why
the new CONFIGs that were added for this were a very bad idea imho.
Obviously the x86-64 kernel doesn't support such things.

Because near all programs that need can actually take advance of it.
