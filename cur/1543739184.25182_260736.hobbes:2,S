That's fascinating, because ia64 is one of the architectures that relies
on sysdata being the same in both the bus and the device:
#define PCI_CONTROLLER(busdev) ((struct pci_controller *) busdev->sysdata)
In various places, we have
        struct pci_controller *controller = PCI_CONTROLLER(dev);
and
        if (PCI_CONTROLLER(bus)->iommu)
So what the hell does Altix do?  Which sysdata can be used to get to the
pci_controller?  This seems like a horrible mistake to me.
