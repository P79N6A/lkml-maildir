Subject: [RFC][PATCH 4/8] do namei_flags calculation inside open_namei()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/28/267

My end goal here is to make sure all users of may_open()
return filps.  This will ensure that we properly release
mount write counts which were taken for the filp in
may_open().
This patch moves the sys_open flags to namei flags
calculation into fs/namei.c.  We'll shortly be moving
the nameidata_to_filp() calls into namei.c, and this
gets the sys_open flags to a place where we can get
at them when we need them.
