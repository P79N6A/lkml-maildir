See my previous about acpid - it is capable of most of this.  In short:
Open kernel event file
read config files: map regexes to actions
open a named UNIX socket
while 1
	wait for event or data on socket
	if it's an event {
		read event
		for each config'ed regex {
			if it matches this event
				run the associated action
		}
		for each UNIX connection {
			notify the connection of the event
		}
	} else if it's a connection on the socket {
		add the connection to the list of notifications
	}
}
Now it would be easy to make UNIX-connecting apps specify one or more 
regexes, instead of getting broadcasted.  It would be similarly easy to 
make it read multiple sources and handle that - acpi, dev_events, 
user_events (UNIX socket or FIFO).

  - it's kind of stale, because it does 
everything it needs to do for now :)  It's small, well tested and easy 
to understand.  Best of all, it's already written.
