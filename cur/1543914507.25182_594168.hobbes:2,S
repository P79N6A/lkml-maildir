The intent seems reasonable.  Would have preferred separate patches for the
separate things though..
This:
akpm:/usr/src/25> grep '^+#' patches/modulec-add-missing-ifdefs-for-config_unused_symbols.patch                                                                 +#ifdef CONFIG_UNUSED_SYMBOLS
+#endif
+#ifdef CONFIG_UNUSED_SYMBOLS
+#endif
+#ifdef CONFIG_UNUSED_SYMBOLS
+#endif
+#ifdef CONFIG_UNUSED_SYMBOLS
+#endif
+#ifdef CONFIG_UNUSED_SYMBOLS
+#endif
+#ifdef CONFIG_UNUSED_SYMBOLS
+#endif
+#ifdef CONFIG_UNUSED_SYMBOLS
+#endif
+#ifdef CONFIG_UNUSED_SYMBOLS
+#endif
+#ifdef CONFIG_UNUSED_SYMBOLS
+#endif
+#ifdef CONFIG_UNUSED_SYMBOLS
+#endif
+#ifdef CONFIG_UNUSED_SYMBOLS
+#endif
is a bit of a maintenance problem though.  Can you think of a way in whcih
we can cut down on that?
