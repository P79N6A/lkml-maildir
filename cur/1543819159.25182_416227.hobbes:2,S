Hi Adrian,
	These are all cluster stack functions and the OCFS2 cluster stack is
pretty much OCFS2 specific right now. So technically one could say they can
all be unexported until used by another related module. I'd rather leave
some of the ones that could make sense as exports though.

Completes an API. Lets keep this one please :)

Hmm, called by the quorum stuff, which right now is embedded in the same
module as heartbeat anyway. Can probably go.

I could definitely see the file system using these.

Can go for now.

Was exported for debugging only anyway AFAIR. Can go.
