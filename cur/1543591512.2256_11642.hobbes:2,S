Sorry,  they would obviously declare it as such if the kernel developers
wanted to.
        /* floating point info */
        unsigned char fpAlign[0] __attribute__ ((aligned (16)));
	union i387_union	i387;
This is a much simpler way of achieving what I was trying to explain
previously.  I think that this syntax has been in the GCC extensions
for some time.
