I hope that this list is the correct place. I ran a small test program with
compiled as follows
gcc -pg -g -o testit testit.c
I then ran the program and it created a gmon.out.
I ran gprof as follows gprof testit > testit.prof
All of my times are zero in the profiler. I have attached the testit.prof.
I'm running a SuSE 2.6 SLES 9 Kernel.
Any hints?   Please CC me directly.
Regards,
Jack
