Unfortunately this patch does two things:
(a) it fixes the problem with PCMCIA cards not being recognised on boot.
(b) it introduces a deadlock between the PCMCIA layer and the driver
    model.
The trace I'm seeing is:

The problem is that the semaphore which prevents ds interfering with the
sleepy card initialisation (in pccardd) is blocking insmod.  However,
the driver is being called with the PCI bus semaphore held.
pccardd in turn discovered a cardbus card, so it is trying to add the
PCI devices to the PCI bus, which requires the PCI bus semaphore.
At present, I do not see a sane solution to this problem - we have two
completely contradictory requirements.  The only way which may work is
to play tricks like "wait 1 second" and hope pccardd has completed type
hacks into PCMCIA to get around this, but that's somewhere I _do not_
want to go.
