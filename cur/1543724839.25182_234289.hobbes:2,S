Exactly.  Don't blame KDE.  Using XFS is equivalent to using 
non-battery-backed NVRAM on an external disk array.  Great if 
performance is _the_ metric and lost results can easily be regenerated 
(like in frame rendering).  By example, if you create a file, write to 
it, and then delete it fast enough, it will never hit the disk under XFS.
