Hi Roman,
while looking for the reason for a compile error in 2.5.48 I noticed the
following that seems to be a bug in the new kconfig:
The following is with a .config that was generated using
"make oldconfig":
<--  snip  -->
$ grep SOUND_WAVEFRONT .config
CONFIG_SOUND_WAVEFRONT=y
$ 
<--  snip  -->
sound/oss/Kconfig contains the following:
<--  snip  -->
...
config SOUND_WAVEFRONT
	tristate "Full support for Turtle Beach WaveFront (Tropez Plus, Tropez, Maui) synth/soundcards"
	depends on SOUND_OSS && m
...
<--  snip  -->
It seems the "&& m" (a common way to ensure that something can only be
built modular) isn't handled correctly.
