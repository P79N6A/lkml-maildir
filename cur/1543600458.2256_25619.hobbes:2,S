I have noticed that serial ports change IRQ to either 3 or 4. There is no
reason for this behavior. I have created a perl script to create a log
containing the irqs assigned and their ioports. Is there anything else I
could log that might unmask the problem?
So far if the serials are assigned to IRQ 4 then the sync with the palm
pilot doesn't work (/dev/pilot = /dev/ttyS0). If its IRQ 3 then it does.
