I may be misreading Greg's concern, but I got the feeling that he's worried
that 2.6.16 isn't *really* fixed, but that something is just papering over the
driver's innate displeasure with HZ==250 (and thus it's likely that in .17 or
.18 or whenever, some *other* patch will make it re-manifest).
And we've seen *enough* bugs that only manifest in even or odd or
divisible-by-7.48 kernels that we know that "it works in 2.6.16" is vastly
different than being able to point at a changeset (or even a stream of fixes)
and say "fixed by that" or "probably went away when this stream of patches
totally reworked the code".
