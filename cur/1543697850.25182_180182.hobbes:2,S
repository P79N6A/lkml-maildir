I believe what Andi was suggesting was if there was **no** processes
that are currently requesting timestamps, then we can dispense with
taking the timestamp.  If a single user asks for the timestamp, then
we would still end up taking timestamps on all packets.  Is this worth
the overhead to keep track of that factor?  It's arguable, but some
platforms, probably yes.
