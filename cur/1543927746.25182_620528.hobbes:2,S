Sure. And it's up to the RT system designer not to do something stupid
like that. The problem is that your patch potentially promotes a
non-RT I/O activity to an RT one without regard to the rest of the
system.
Stop for a moment and look at all the kernel threads on the system. If
your argument was sensible, we'd have raised various of these threads
to (CPU) RT ages ago. But if we do, we actually royally foul up things
that have tried to carefully isolate themselves from SCHED_NORMAL
tasks. If a kernel thread preempted our watchdog or our data
collection process because it was trying to service a lower priority
task, that would be fatally broken.
As kernel engineers, we -do not know- the absolute importance of a
given subsystem in the wider scheme of things. Thus we have no
business promoting anything outside the "normal" range into RT unless
explicitly asked to (eg chrt) or if we're actually doing real deadlock
avoidance.

And so do all your PVR sales. Two spindles is economically impossible
on a set-top PVR.
And I rather expect this all also applies to having XFS volumes on top
of LVM + RAID5 along with other filesystems but I haven't looked
closely.

Absolutely (unless we're actually going to do priority inheritance).
The only person who can know the real RT requirements of a system is
the system's designer. If he wants to boost the priority of XFS I/O
threads into RT, he should be allowed to, but it shouldn't happen
automatically.
Consider someone concurrently running a database on a filesystem and
an RT data collection task direct to a separate partition. RT I/O may
currently allow them to successfully

Perfectly understood. And that's fine. A system designer is allowed to
shoot himself in the foot.

I don't think there's any fundamental reason the I/O subsystem or
filesystems can't be taught to handle priority inversion, which is
much more acceptable and general fix.

..which makes it fairly attractive to PVR folks until you go mucking
with RT behind their backs.
If I've got XFS on filesystems A and B on the same spindle (or volume
group?) and my real RT I/O takes place only on B, then I want log
flushing to happen in RT on B. But -never on A-. If I can do this with
a tunable, I'm perfectly happy.
