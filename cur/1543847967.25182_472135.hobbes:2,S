If I understand what you want to do, you just have to do this :
$ git-checkout 2.6.18
$ git-pull . libata
This will merge in 2.6.18 everything that's in libata. If you
want to check before what will be merged :
$ git-log 2.6.18..libata
or :
$ git-diff 2.6.18..libata
or also to review the patches one at a time :
$ git-format-patch -k -m 2.6.18..libata
then read all the files.
Hoping it helps
