Good catch!
I just tried with 2.6.17-rc5-mm3. The BUG still happens with 4K stacks,
but the system runs fine with 8K stacks.
Another info: the system is able to run fine with the following scenario,
even with 4K stack:
- boot to runlevel 1
- load pktcdvd (modprobe + pktsetup)
- then go to runlevel 5 
It fails if pktcdvd is loaded at runlevel 2 or higher.
