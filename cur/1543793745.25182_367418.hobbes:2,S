Hi,
Commit 88baf3e85af72f606363a85e9a60e9e61cc64a6c:
 "[PATCH] fix floppy.c to store correct ro/rw status in underlying gendisk"
causes an annoying side-effect. Upon first write attempt to a floppy I get 
this:
$ dd if=bootdisk.img of=/dev/fd0 bs=1440k
dd: writing `/dev/fd0': Operation not permitted
1+0 records in
0+0 records out
Any successive attempts succeed without problem. Confirmed that backing 
out the patch fixes it.
