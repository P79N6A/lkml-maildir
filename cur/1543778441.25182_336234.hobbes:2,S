A similar problem was noted with RHEL4, it seems the modules.pcimap
and pci.ids file were correct, but the pcitable file contained entries
for all ql[ae]23xx based HBAs to load qla2300.ko.
It's my understanding that this was fixed for RHEL4 U1.  Which distro
are you using?  If you are using RHEL, and are still having problems,
I'd suggest you file a report with Redhat.
