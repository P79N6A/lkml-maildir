Hello,
Does anyone have pppoe working with 2.4.0?
I'm running 2.4.0-ac9 with ppp and pppoe compiled into the kernel (I've
tried with modules too)
The pppd simply refuses to acknowlege the presence of ppp support in the
kernel.
The last release of pppd was in august 2000.  Was this before the ppp
interface in the 
kernel was overhauled?
