You make my point for me, there is no magic, and when building a module it
should require that the directory be specified by either a command line
option (as noted below) or by being built as part of a source tree. There
*is* no good default in that particular case.

Related for sure, the point I was making was that there is no good default
place to put modules built outside a kernel source tree (and probably also
when built for multiple kernels). I was suggesting that the module tree of
the running kernel might be a really poor choice. I don't think I was
clear in my first post, I was not suggesting a better default, I was
suggesting that any default is likely to bite.
I'm not unhappy that Mr. Woodhouse disagrees, I just think he missed my
point the first time and I'm trying to clarify.
