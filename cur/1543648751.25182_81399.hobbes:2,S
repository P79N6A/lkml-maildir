Hi,
Marius A. Eriksen just finished the Linux port of systrace.  You can
find the kernel patch at
  
http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/systrace/linux.html
Systrace is a fine grained sandbox for applications and system services.
It supports interactive policy generation, intrusion detection, policy
enforcement, privilege elevation, etc.  More information at

Comments are appreciated.
Niels.
