In fact I've been cleaning up a bit the 2.4 version before
submitting it -- the entries for other VIA chips are a bit
more convoluted and I suspect the first patch is not as
complete as it should be. In fact I think I'll post a 2.5
followup soon.
Please do not apply the first patch and use this one instead.
I didn't tested it myself (not enough time) but Johannes
Winkelmann reports it as ok. It's pretty straightforward
anyway, just id lists all over the place.
Best regards,
