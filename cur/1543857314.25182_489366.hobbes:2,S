That we'd have to put a conditional jump in there is an incorrect
assumption on risc machines.  At least on parisc we can do conditional
nullifies in the executing instruction pipeline, so we'd read, nullify
the following write if the bit were set.  We do this a lot in our page
interruption handlers.
