Could you post the contents of that directory and the 2 affected
inodes?
You can read them with
#debugfs /dev/?? -R 'stat <10022921>' > stat_dir.txt
#debugfs /dev/?? -R 'stat <843004500>' > stat_entry.txt
#debugfs /dev/?? -R 'cat <10022921>' > dir_data.txt
Have you already run fsck?
I'm also intrested in the output from fsck.
