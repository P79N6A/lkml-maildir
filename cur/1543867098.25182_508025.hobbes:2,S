Heh. It's because we search for the localversion files in both $objtree 
and $srctree, and normally they are one and the same - so it finds the 
same file twice.
The old code did the same thing, but with the "make" $(sort ..) function, 
which apparently removes duplicates. We should use "sort -u" here.
Both the old code *and* the new code is just horribly complex. The old 
code appears to suffer from GNU $(wildcard ..), the new code is almost as 
ugly in doing an unnecessarily complex "find".
Oh well.
