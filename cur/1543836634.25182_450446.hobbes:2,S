Yes, part of the packet must live in skb->data, but it does not differ
from frag_list management - place part of the data in skb->data and the
rest into frag_list.
If you can create several skbs and link them togeter you defenitely can
organize pages into frag_list, just get pages from different skb->data
and free those skbs.

No one says it is easy or not, but I'me 100% sure that 32k allocation
for 9k jumbo frame in atomic context is not what people expect from
high-performance NIC.
