Yes, esd is an interrupt hog, it seems.  When reading this thread, I
checked, and sure enough I was getting 190 interrupts/sec on the
sound card while not playing any sound.  I killed esd (which I don't
use anyways), and interrupts went to 0/sec when not playing sound.
Still at 190/sec when using mpg123 on my ymfpci (Yamaha YMF744B DS-1S)
sound card.
Cheers, Andreas
