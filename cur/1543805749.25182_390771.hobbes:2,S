To some extent.

People didn't care, because the AS/400 was based on a proprietary solution.  
I remember a client being forced to dump an AS/400 due to astronomical 
maintenance costs.
With todays generically mass-produced 64bit archs, what's not to care about a 
cost-effective system that provides direct mapped access into linear address 
space?
Thanks!
