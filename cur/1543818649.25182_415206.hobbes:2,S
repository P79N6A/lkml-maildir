Any arguments on the kernel boot command line ("append" in lilo.conf or 
equivalent in grub) are passed down to the master process, as specified by 
the init= boot option, if any (defaults to /sbin/init for non-initrd 
kernels, defaults to /init for initramfs, and defaults to something else 
for initrds).
