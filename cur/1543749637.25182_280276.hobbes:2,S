What sort of reasonably OK? My experience on my 64MB P2-350 Dell 
Optiplex is that 2.6.9-acXX will kill things off at random even when the 
machine isn't out of memory. If you have any particular test cases you 
would like run just ask, I understand that some of the difficulty is 
that the VM developers have machines plenty big enough not to suffer the 
problems.
The embedded market is different, we're not likely to see multi-gigabyte 
mobile phones, PDAs, PVRs or whatever for a while at least. 64MB is not 
*that* small.
