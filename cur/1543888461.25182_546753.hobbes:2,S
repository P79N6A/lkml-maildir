Subject: [realtime kernel 2.6.21-rt2 and up] Extremely slow bootup for x86_64

When i try to boot a kernel higher than 2.6.21-rt1, it boots very
slowly. It takes minutes to even detect two cdrom players. I noticed
in the changelog:
- x86/64 high-res timers and dynticks update (Thomas Gleixner)
I included the .config from 2.6.21-rt1, which i ran make oldconfig on.
I cannot provide any other information, since i estimate it will take
ages to bootup.
Please CC me when replying, because i do not recieve this list.
Sincerely,
Maarten Maathuis.
