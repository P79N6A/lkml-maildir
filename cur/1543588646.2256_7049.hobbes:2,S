The question is: How? If you do it like ramfs, you cannot swap
these symlinks and this is effectively a mlock(symlink) operation
allowed for normal users. -> BAD!
One idea is to only use a page, if the entry will be pushed into
swap and thus only wasting swap, not memory (where we have more
of it).
But allocating a page on memory pressure is also not a bright
idea.
OTOH we could force this entry to swap immedately, after we
copied it from the dentry. So we can do an GFP_ATOMIC allocation
and do not too much harm to memory pressure and only make the IO
a bit stormier.
I think there are a lot of races, which I don't see now.
So please don't beat me too much, if this is a completly stupid
idea, ok?  ;-)
