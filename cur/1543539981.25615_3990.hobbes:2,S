I would really think hard about this.
Mounting (or replacing) on an current mount path, busy or nor, wil really
lead to bizzare and damaging senerios later.
You may not see the "why" now, but when your process mounts a volume, and
takes time between acess (busy), if it is replaced, something will go boom!
RULE: once a path is mounted upon, no mounts are allowed on any of the path
         (directory) components.
If you insist on adding this "feature", please make it a system tunable (config)
option. Some of us really do not want it.
