Please bear in mind that this is an implementation issue. As I've
explained elsewhere, there are ways to implement this where even
compiled-in static tracepoints have practically no cost at all
-- being noops until enabling. Thereby being no justification for
not actually shipping with such built kernels and, therefore,
no reason why tools such as ltt can't real-world usage.
