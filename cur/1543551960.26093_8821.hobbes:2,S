Just to clarify -- my use of get_module_symbol has nothing to do with
load order.  It has to do with allowing a drm module to work with or
without the agpgart module loaded.
If there's some other way to do this, I'll be happy to move to that.
I'd like to preserve the ability to have one driver which works with
each chipset family and not have to have separate drivers for PCI and
AGP cards (or, rather, to have fewer instances of the drivers -- they
already depend on SMP and MODVERSIONS, and that's a lot of overhead
already if you just want to play Q3A :).  I'd also like a dual-head
system to be able to load the same drm module and just have it work
for both the agp and the pci cards (this isn't supported yet, in case
anyone is wondering).

See above and my mail from a few minutes ago.  I'd like to keep it
(with the naming changes John Levon proposed, even if we don't make it
available when CONFIG_MODULES is 'n').
