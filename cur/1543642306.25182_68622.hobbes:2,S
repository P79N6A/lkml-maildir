Convergent evolution.  That's exactly the same number I'm handling as a
chunk in my rmap sharing project (backgrounded for the moment).  In this
case, the 32 comes from the number of bits you can store in a long, and
it conveniently happens to fall in the sweet spot of performance as well.
In this case I only have to manipulate one list element though, because
I'm taking the lru list itself out onto the shared rmap node, saving 8
bytes in struct page as a side effect.  So other than the size of the
chunk, the resemblance is slight.  ETA for this is 2.7, unless you
suddenly start threatening to back out rmap again.

I think the extra refcount strategy is inherently stronger, and this
is an example of why.  The other would require you to take/drop an
extra count explicitly for your private list.
