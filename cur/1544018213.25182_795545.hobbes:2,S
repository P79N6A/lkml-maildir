Ok, I'm looking at this now, but have a question:
which quirk code(s)/bits should I use for that?
Assuming the table in question is in
 drivers/hid/usbhid/hid-quirks.c
file.
What's needed is to stop usbhid module from claiming this device in the
first place.

Oh, I didn't know.  In fact, that's exactly what I was asking in my
first email in this thread - to have some module parameter or a sysfs
file which can be touched to stop the module from claiming the device.
This also helps to debug it, to know the right bits to use.. which I
don't know...  ;)
The device in question which I'm dealing with is an UPS by Powercom,
Imperial series (they sold other series with UPS support too, namely
some KING PRO ones, which has exactly the same "interface").  It's
 Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0d9f:0002 Powercom Co., Ltd  Serial to USB adaptor
and this vendor:device is known to cypress_m8 driver, in
drivers/usb/serial/cypress_m8.[ch]:
 /* Powercom UPS, chip CY7C63723 */
 #define VENDOR_ID_POWERCOM               0x0d9f
 #define PRODUCT_ID_UPS                   0x0002
So here we go - I only need to know which quirk to use ;)
What I do *not* know is if there are other UPS model from the same
vendor with the same product ID but which really ARE HID devices.
But having in mind amount of questions asked about this very device,
all with the same answer (before it was "use this custom binary kernel
module", since 2.6.25 it's "use cypress_m8 driver"), i think it does
not matter anymore... ;)
Thanks!
