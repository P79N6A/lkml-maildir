Doesn't this imply maintainance nightmares for source which
includes foo.h? Or else more complexity in makefiles?
I find it convenient to use `ln -s /usr/src/linux-<version>
/usr/src/linux` with the customary symlinks in /usr/include.
A makefile need only
`ln -sf ...` to demand a version.
It's handy for patching, too.
OTOH I can see that someone more active than I might wish to
make several versions simultaneously.
