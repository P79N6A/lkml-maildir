I'm using the 2.6.16.16 kernel.  Is there any chance that I could
trouble you for a snippet of code to do that?  I've tried every
combination I can think of.
Thank you,
:b!

In general, allocate the memory in kernel space (via get_free_page et
al), and make accessible to userspace via mmap on a device node.
