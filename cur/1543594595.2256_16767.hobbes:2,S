It works, but you can't load iptables modules at the same time as
ipchains. Be sure ipchains is the only module you are loading. rmmod any
iptables items before modprobe of ipchains. If you are running redhat,
also do not believe the script in /etc/rc.d/init.d/ipchains as to
whether or not ipchains is actually running, it is broken (does not
check return values), and lies and does not tell you when ipchains
startup fails (as root manually do something like ipchains -L -n).
