Linux needs something beyond what it has today, at least for the
HPC market SGI is familiar with.  We believe it will more generally
benefit Linux HPC and enterprise markets, which is one reason we've
released the whole CSA stack as open source.

We're running CSA in production on Altix (our Itanium/Linux platform)
for several years now.

A substantial number of our customers require it.  CSA has been
developed over the years on SGI's HPC systems in response to our
customers needs.  It's been reimplemented and opensourced for Linux,
originally as an SGI/LANL collaboration.

Actually, one secondary feature on our wishlist is 'projects'.
Our customers are tied into the current CSA user interface.
However, there is lots of room for cooperation under that, particularly
in the kernel.  We can always consider a migration project as well.
