Subject: IDE-SCSI grabs too many drives

I have append="hdc=ide-scsi" in my lilo.conf file,
but when I modprobe ide-scsi, it grabs both the
CD-RW and the DVD-ROM:
SCSI subsystem driver Revision: 1.00
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
   Vendor: HP        Model: CD-Writer+ 9100   Rev: 1.0c
   Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
   Vendor: RAITE     Model: RDR-108H          Rev: 1.7
   Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Shouldn't it just make only hdc a SCSI drive?
If I unload ide-scsi and modprobe ide-cd instead, I get this:
hdc: ATAPI 32X CD-ROM CD-R/RW drive, 4096kB Cache, UDMA(33)
hdd: ATAPI 40X DVD-ROM drive, 256kB Cache, UDMA(33)
Of course, I can't burn CD's with this configuration.
I want the CD-RW as a SCSI drive, and the DVD-ROM as an IDE drive.
For some reason, mplayer only works when the DVD-ROM is an IDE
device.  If I try to use the SCSI equivalent, it hangs.
So, how do I get hdc as a SCSI drive, and hdd as an IDE drive?
Any and all help will be appreciated.
