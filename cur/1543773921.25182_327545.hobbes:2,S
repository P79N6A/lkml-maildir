  Not just the compiler -- the linker would need to be a lot smarter too:
/* foo.c */
extern int bar1(void), bar2(void), bar3(void);
main() {
        if (likely(bar1()))
                bar2();
        else
                bar3();
}
/* bar.c */
int bar1(void) { return 1; }
int bar2(void) { whatever; }
int bar3(void) { whatever; }
  When you compile bar.c the compiler has _no_ idea which functions are likely
to be called.
  And doing this manually is trivial:
        1. Add two sections to vmlinux.lds.S: .fast.text and .slow.text
        2. Define __fast __attribute__(__section__(".fast.text"))
        3. Define __slow similarly
        4. Start tagging functions with __fast and __slow as needed
  Very little work for much potential gain, AFAICS.
