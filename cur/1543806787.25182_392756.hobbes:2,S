Why bother. You can already create a private large file and mmap it if
you want to do this, and you will get better performance than being
smeared around swap with everyone else.
Currently swap means your data is mixed in with other stuff. Swap could
do preallocation of each vma when running in limited overcommit modes
and it would run a lot faster if you did but you would pay a lot in
flexibility and efficiency, as well as needing a lot more swap.
Far better to let applications wanting to work this way do it
themselves. Just mmap and the cache balancing and pager will do the rest
for you.
