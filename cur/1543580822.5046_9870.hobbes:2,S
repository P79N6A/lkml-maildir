Subject: 2.2.17: weird eepro100 msgs

Hello,
The system is as follows:
- Intel CA810EAL motherboard (built-in EtherExpress Pro 10/100)
- 128MB RAM
- 10GB IDE HD (Western Digital WD100)
- Linux kernel 2.2.18
Sometimes when I reboot the system, as soon as the eepro100 module is
loaded, I start to get these msgs on the screen:
eth0: card reports no resources.
eth0: card reports no RX buffers.
eth0: card reports no resources.
eth0: card reports no RX buffers.
eth0: card reports no resources.
eth0: card reports no RX buffers.
(...)
They go on forever, and the box becomes inoperational (I can see the msgs
on the screen, but I can't login, type anything ...). If I reboot the
system, the msgs do NOT show up anymore, and then I can use the system
again.
Could anyone _please_ shed a light on this one for me?!?! How could I
solve it?? What kind of additional info you need?? Please let me know.
Later,
Ivan
