Subject: How to make "dead key" capslockable with kbd?

Hi,
I'm currently trying to customize my keymap file, but I have a problem: 
I'cant make these damn "dead key" correctly capslockable.
As the manpage from keymaps say:
Each  keysym  may  be prefixed by a '+' (plus sign), in which case this
keysym is treated as a "letter" and therefore  affected  by  the  "Cap-
sLock"  the same way as by "Shift"
That's what I have in my keymap file:
[...]
keycode   7 = +dead_circumflex  six        notsign          
Control_asciicircum
        alt     keycode   7 = Meta_six
[...]
With this, when I press the key with keycode 7 and capslock is "on", the 
caracter "6" is effectively displayed. On the other hand, when capslock 
is turned "off", this same key displays immediatly (i.e: is no more a 
dead key):
^B
I load the keymap file with:
loadkeys file.kmap.gz
I'm running linux-2.6.1 on an up-to-date Debian Sid.
Could someone tell me how I can make this working ?
TIA !
