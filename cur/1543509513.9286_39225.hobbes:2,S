Subject: NFS problem: __nfs_fhget: inode still busy

I have an nfs client which virtually hangs immediately after boot. it
continually prints out the message:
__nfs_fhget: inode 8227 still busy, i_count=1
This happens just after finishing executing rc.local. (RH5 boot-up
scripts). It's then supposed to start xdm, but never get's that far.
Inode number is always the same.
I booted up in single user mode. started only the network and
portmap, then mounted all the nfs mounts. Which seemed to work.
However if i do something like ls /*/*/* or find / it will eventually
get stuck with the same message as above (but different inode numbers
mostly). If i do find / without the nfs mounts it works fine.
The machine is nearly diskless, it mounts /usr, /opt /usr/local,
/home, /var/spool/mail, /var/tmp, ... etc from a linux server.
Client and kernel are running same kernel: 2.2.11 with all the
patches from knfsd 1.4.6 applied. Other machines running the same
kernel, (or same codebase in case of non-x86 machines) work fine.
I've cleaned out rmtab, state and etab on the server but it makes no
difference.
Help needed!!! What can i do to get this machine to boot again?
thanks,
