The point was made earlier that a module might include some code expanded from
a macro in a kernel header file.  Producers of binary 
modules could adopt a "clean room" approach (as the first cloners of 
the IBM PC BIOS did) and have one group write a technical specification 
for any necessary kernel headers and have a second group implement 
substitute headers from the specification.

In the US it may be a violation of the DCMA prohibition on 
circumvention of "effective access controls" (and perhaps violations of 
corresponding laws in some European countries).  Though that's a whole 
'nother huge legal morass.
