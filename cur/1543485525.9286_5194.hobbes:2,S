Hello everybody,
First of all pls "newbie mode on", so flames on me. I have two related 
questions:
1) Can somebody tell/point me to the appropriate resource that explains
the differences between the static kernel symbol table (System.map)
and the exported kernel symbol table (/proc/ksyms) ? If my
undestanding is right the second contains _also_ the symbols exported
by modules, so it should be just a superset of the first. Seems that
is not the case. What am i missing ?
2) The meaning of the second field in System.map (t/T) ?
TIA and sorry for any annoyance (if any),
Florian
