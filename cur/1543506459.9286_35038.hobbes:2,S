Some removable medias don't tell Linux when you change the disk. The 
easies way to make it work is to try to mount the device before 
reinserting a new disk (you'll get some orrors of course... ignore 
them), so Linux notices you changed it.

Strange. I get a "READ CAPACITY failed, blah blah blah", but then all 
works fine.
