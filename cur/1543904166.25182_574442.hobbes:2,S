That cannot be a justification for breaking serial port probe that has 
been working for 10+ years.
The VAST MAJORITY of computers, all told, have one or more serial ports 
in the expected places.  We must consider the majority first, then 
tackle edge cases like weirdo laptops that can be detected by other means.
Now that we have established the double-probe problem as potentially 
bogus, and not investigated at all, we are left with:
You changed legacy serial probing, affecting millions of computers, due 
to a few machines with unusual IR configurations.
At this point the "revert! revert!" submarine alarm is sounding quite 
loudly.  You can fix IR without breaking legacy serial.
