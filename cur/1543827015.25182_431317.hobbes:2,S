Yup, agreed.  I do think that we are going to have some interoperability
problems with some existing clients in the marketplace though.  Perhaps
we can get some of those folks to look at their clients and make them a
little more explicit about what bits needs to be changed, as opposed to
assuming that the server would just do what the client expected.
