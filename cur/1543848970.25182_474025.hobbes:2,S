Indeed.  That's one pending patch that never got around to be submitted
(and had bitrotten at least 3 times, IIRC).
ACK, provided that reiserfs folks are OK with the replacement name for
their struct.  Note that "path" in question has very little to do with
pathnames - it's a path in balanced tree, IIRC.  So if we get around
to renaming that sucker, it might be a good time to pick better name.
Certainly ACK for generic part.
