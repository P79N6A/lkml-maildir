Humm, that might be a pretty high fence for me to jump there Bill.  
ATM, what I'm running is 11.2, with the bk-ieee1394.patch, and for my 
uses, it certainly seems to be bulletproof.  But then I'm not running 
a server with 30,000 clients either, this is your classic geeks 
desktop here, even if the geek is 70 years old.  Firewire Just 
Works(TM), usb seems to be back among the living and I'm a relatively 
happy camper.  Till the next patch comes out & I'll just *have* to 
try it...  :)
Heck, if the next .3 patch just was a relabeled bk-ieee1394.patch, I'd 
be in Hog Heaven.  And if the next patch after that made my 
pcHDTV-3000 card work out of the box,  I'd offer the patch maker a 
couple of his favorite libations.  Hows that for a good deal?  So 
far, thats a re-install after every reboot situation now because the 
replacement modules are built out of the tree.

We've noted that previously.  OTOH, he has always managed to come up 
with perfectly valid objections to those not accepted if queried 
about the whynots.  I can't argue with that for a heartbeat since I 
don't and cannot come close to having an overall view in as much 
detail as he obviously keeps in his head.
