This would mesh nicely with the filesystem (and other content) probing
tool/lib that I wrote, blkid.  It probes filesystem types (and also
label, uuid, fs size for common fs types).

Hmm, it does seem a bit large for what it is doing.  Any idea where
the bloat is coming from?
My blkid lib is 34kB (uncompressed) and supports 23 filesystem types
(all that the current mount(8) has), although only a handful have full
LABEL and UUID support.  The user tool is 6.5kB and I also use libuuid.so.
Cheers, Andreas
