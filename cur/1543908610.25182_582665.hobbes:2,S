BTW the patch was actually from Rusty, not me, just the From 
line got lost somewhere. I did a few changes though because
the initial version didn't work on x86-64 at all. Submitted
one worked for me.

The code is used on x86-64 too, but the script that generates
the prefixes doesn't know this (perhaps I should drop them)

Ok that settles it.
However I must say I'm still dubious of Petr's patch. If there
is something wrong with alternative() then it must be fixed
in alternative() not the call sites. Otherwise it could hit
other patch sites too. There are other copies who
use a similar patching pattern.
Can people who see a failure please send me .config and 
arch/x86_64/lib/memcpy.o privately ?
