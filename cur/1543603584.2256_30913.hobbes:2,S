Well, if we fall back to polling devices if the IRQ is disabled, then the
shared interrupt case can be handled as well.  However, there were complaints
about the patch when Ingo had device polling included, as opposed to just
IRQ mitigation.

Well, since the IRQ itself uses system resources, if it is disabled it will
allow those resources to actually do something (i.e. polling instead, when
we know there is a lot of work to do).
Even if it does not have polling in the patch, the choice is to turn off
the IRQ, or have the system hang because it can not make any progress
because of the high number of interrupts.  If your patch ensures that the
network IRQ load is kept down, then Ingo's will never be activated.
Cheers, Andreas
