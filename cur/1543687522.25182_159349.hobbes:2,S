This is the IPMI event log (the System Event Log).

I'll work on that.  Is the description below good enough?

It seems to me that with a function with this many parameter calls, it's 
a lot easier to handle them one per line, since counting lines is a lot 
easier than finding commas.  I'd prefer to leave this as is (I'll work 
on reducing the number of parameters, which is the real problem :-), but 
I'm not picky either way.  I didn't know Windows developers did this.
