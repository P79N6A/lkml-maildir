You mean do a syscall with flags O_DIRECT from within the driver?
I don't like syscalsl from kernel code, but if you say so, I'll think
about it.

Mmm ..  I must say I don't see how.  Making all requests on a block
device not be cached by VMS seems to me to have a globally defined
semantics, not confined to my particular use or context! Are you
suggesting that it depends on the mode of access to the device? That I
can't control - I simply want ALL accesses to not be cached.
