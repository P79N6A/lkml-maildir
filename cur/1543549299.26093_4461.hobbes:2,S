Interesting.  Do you mean that you don't want any user reordering via
.config at all, or merely that you yourself have more
important stuff to do.  I can code up something myself if I 
feel the need.  Complete control of order is ideal, it solves
every problem an expert user might have.  Ability to
put one particular controller first solves the boot issues
just fine though.
