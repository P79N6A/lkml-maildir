I recently looked into 2) a bit and the dm multipath code is almost
enough to do exactly this.
If you configure your block device as an mpath device that queues on
path failure, and change the table to the new device location on device
re-attach, the queued up i/o will be flushed out. Almost. Right now,
when you change the table and resume the dm mapping, it does a suspend
which attempts to write out the data to a device which is no longer
there, causing it to just be dropped on the floor. If this were changed
not to do that, and perhaps set a timer so that the dirty data wouldn't
be left around forever if the device wasn't reattached, 2) would
definitely be possible.
I realize that the userspace intervention required may involve a bit of
dark magic, but my point is most of the code required on the kernel side
is already implemented.
