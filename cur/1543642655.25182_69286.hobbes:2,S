   That's easy to say until you try and work with it (I assume you have,
   and forgot).  Just try to do a 3G/1G split on it, for example.
Maybe you missed the "64-bit mode" part of what I said. :-)
In 64-bit mode there is no need to do any kind of split.
You just use the KSEG mapping with full cache coherency for
all of physical memory as the PAGE_OFFSET area.
I forget if it was KSEG0 or some other number, but I know it
works.
