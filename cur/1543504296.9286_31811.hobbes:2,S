Yeah, it would.  Is there any good reason not to do this?  If this doesn't
have problems, why isn't the same thing done for other kernel ID's?  I
can't think of a single place in the kernel where kernel space pointers
get exported to user space as opaque handles, and that makes me nervous
about being the first person to do it.  (OTOH, I can think of several
places where NT does this... which makes me even more nervous about doing
it in Linux. <g>)
