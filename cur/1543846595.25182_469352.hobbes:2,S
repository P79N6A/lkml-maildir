Your opinion. Mine's different, as the unwind directives are specifically
meant to allow changing to a different stack page. Also, there shouldn't
be any potential for corrupt unwind data (once all annotations are
correct, the lack or incorrectness of which I'd rather attribute as bugs
of the old code or, in one case, the compiler) as long as it's being
properly write protected; corruption of the stack should be affecting
the quality of old and new style back traces in similar ways.

Again, a corrupt stack will not allow you getting reliable data out of the
old unwinder either. Even worse when you consider a stack overflow and
your request for range checks (or pointers into the stack) - you might not
get a stack trace then at all.
