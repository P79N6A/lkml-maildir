Holy cow!  Are you sure these numbers are right?
The increased throughput will be thanks to the boosted request
queue size.
The (greatly) increased CPU load will also be due to browsing the eight-times
larger request queue.  Plus we browse it a bit more than we used to.
The improvement in worst-case latency in both -aa and -jam will
be due to the FIFO wait for requests.
But improvement by a factor of 20,000 sounds a little excessive :)
And a maximum latency of three milliseconds would seem to indicate
that the benchmark is *never* waiting on disk seek, and that
perhaps the request queue is simply never filling up.  But that
doesn't make sense.
What does the "latency" actually mean?  Is it the time spent
in the kernel to issue a write(2)?
Something funny is happening, I suspect.  Guess I should go
look at tiobench...
