What I proposed as a possible implementation was to have anything which
did a trackable operation on the inode send a notify to user space. And
that isn't the same as dnotify although it might address some of the same
uses. As a for instance when an open is done the open code sends a notify,
and until that time it's not obvious that the inode must be pinned. By
having a single user program accept the notify and decide what to do, the
kernel can do less of it. Yes, that could mean passing out a lot of
information which would be dropped by the user program. That's what I had
in mind when I asked if the process needed to be real time.

If an idea is so tenuous that one person noting that the memory overhead
of a feature is or could be very high and asking "could it be done thus"
provides Stop Enargy then there may be a lack of conviction.
I personally don't mind being questioned on an idea, it points out flaws,
it lets me be confident that I have it right, or at least avoid putting a
lot of effort into something and then having someone say "oh here's a
better way." I don't go with "how dare you question me?"
I have virtually no experience with dnotify, but a lot with putting Linux
on old small systems to give to low income kids who can buy "modern" 
machines, and if I see a feature which won't run on a small machine I want
to suggest that there might be a better way. Sorry, a lower resource cost
way. 
Developers don't typically have small slow machines, and don't think about
the old, embedded, or laptop uses unless someone mentions it. I'm sorry
you think think I'm talking to hear myself talk, the point I'm making is
valid to me.
