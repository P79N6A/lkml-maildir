Yes, it's very nice. Anton Blanchard has benchmarked both patch variants
(tree vs. scalable-hash page buckets) for SMP scalability against the
stock hash, on big RAM, many CPUs boxes, via dbench load. He has found
performance of radix trees vs. scalable hash to be at least equivalent. (i
think Anton has a few links to show the resulting graphs.)
In fact the radix trees showed a slight performance/scalability edge in
some parts of the performance curve. So given the fact that hashes/buckets
were *purely* designed for speed/scalability and not for RAM usage, this
proves that radix trees are superior. Plus the locking is much simpler
than for the hash buckets solution. Which make radix trees a clear winner
IMO.
