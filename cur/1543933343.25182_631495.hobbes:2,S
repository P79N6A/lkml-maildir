Subject: [MIPS] MEM_SDREFCFG is not defined for Alchemy DB1550 (compile fail)

Hello,
When I have:
CONFIG_MIPS_DB1550
CONFIG_SOC_AU1550
CONFIG_SOC_AU1X00
CONFIG_PM
MEM_SDREFCFG is used at:
arch/mips/au1000/common/power.c::pm_do_freq()
While the MEM_SDREFCFG constant is declare only for CONFIG_SOC_AU1000,
CONFIG_SOC_AU1500, CONFIG_SOC_AU1100 at:
include/asm-mips/mach-au1x00/au1000.h
Maybe MEM_SDREFCFG should be defined for CONFIG_SOC_AU1X00?
Or there should be #ifdef for its usage in power.c?
Best Regards,
Alon Bar-Lev.
