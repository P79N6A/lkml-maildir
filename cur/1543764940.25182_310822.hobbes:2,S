Hello Andrew,
I don't know whether you remember the mysterious crashes I was telling you 
about last week and me rookiesh-ly trying to debug them with kgdb over the 
serial console. Well, today I tried for the n-th time again and after rc2-mm3 
blocked again while loading, here's what I did:
<snip>
[   12.335438] NET: Registered protocol family 17
[   12.362483] Testing NMI watchdog ... OK.
[   12.416195] Starting balanced_irq
[   12.443099] VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
[   12.472490] Freeing unused kernel memory: 196k freed
[   12.521004] logips2pp: Detected unknown logitech mouse model 1
[   12.572581] Warning: unable to open an initial console.
[   12.972518] input: PS/2 Logitech Mouse on isa0060/serio1
Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.
0xc0102ee7 in resume_kernelX () at atomic.h:175 <--- this one is wrong for a 
mysterious reason
175     {
(gdb) p $eip
$1 = (void *) 0xc0102ee7
(gdb) disas 0xc0102ee7
Dump of assembler code for function resume_kernelX:
0xc0102ee7 <resume_kernelX+0>:  mov    0x30(%esp),%eax
0xc0102eeb <resume_kernelX+4>:  mov    0x38(%esp),%ah
0xc0102eef <resume_kernelX+8>:  mov    0x2c(%esp),%al
0xc0102ef3 <resume_kernelX+12>: and    $0x20403,%eax
0xc0102ef8 <resume_kernelX+17>: cmp    $0x403,%eax
0xc0102efd <resume_kernelX+22>: je     0xc0102f0c <ldt_ss>
End of assembler dump.
(gdb)  
And as we see, we're at the "mov    0x30(%esp),%eax" which accesses above the 
bottom of the stack. After applying nmi_stack_correct-fix.patch, rc2-mm3 
booted just fine, so I IMHO think that we might still be needing this, after 
all.
Regards,
Boris.
