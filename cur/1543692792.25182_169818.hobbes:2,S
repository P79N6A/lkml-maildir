Another thing to try is rather generic...  If you have ACPI on, try 
booting with "acpi=off" or "pci=biosirq" or messing around with settings 
in BIOS setup.
In general I recommend that SATA be used "native" or "enhanced" mode 
according to BIOS, and that "legacy" or "combined" mode is to be 
avoided.  (legacy mode is fine for PATA...)
