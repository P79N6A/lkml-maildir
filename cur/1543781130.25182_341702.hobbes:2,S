I'm not sure remap_file_pages was ever intended to be more integrated.
It pretty much always was a Oracle specific performance hack. The problem
with making it more powerful is that it will become more invasive then
(like your patchbomb shows) and that will make it a bigger maintenance
issue longer term and complicate all of VM. And it's probably not
worth doing all that.
So in short I think it's better to keep it into its corner with minimum
functionality and let it not expand to other parts.
