Subject: time outs during NFS mounts 2.1.131 + 2.2.0-pre6

I'm seeing some strange behavior with 2.2.0-pre6.
	I load the kernel via bootp from a Digital Unix 4.0E system
	The kernel starts and mounts its root filesystem via NFS, the root
file system is being served by a Digital Unix 4.0E system.
	The mount occurs with no problems, everything runs fine through
inittab till an additional NFS mount takes place. An image library defined
in /etc/fstab and mounted via (/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S15nfsfs).
When this mount is attempted the system hangs ~2 min, while awaiting a
timeout. there are 4 messages displayed on the console during this time:
----
portmap: server localhost not responding time out
portmap: server localhost not responding time out
lockd_up: makesocket failed error :-5
portmap: server localhost not responding time out
----
The system then continues with no problems, and the image library is mounted
via NFS?
this does not occur when using a 2.0.35 kernel, but is produced with 2.1.131
and 2.2.0-pre6
Anyone have a clue to whats going on
Thanks
JJ
