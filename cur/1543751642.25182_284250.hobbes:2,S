Point taken, but do keep in mind that this will *certainly* be disabled
by default, unless you run an audio oriented distro, and we assume those
people know what they're doing ;-)

Ingo said "it should work".  It currently doesn't, as you can see from
Jack's post.  My concern here is, the semantics of SCHED_FIFO are well
defined and stable.  The highest priority runnable SCHED_FIFO process
*always* runs.  The semantics of "nice -20" apparently change from
release to release, as you can see.  We can't have the scheduler
deciding to run something else when jackd needs to run because it
decides jackd is hogging the CPU or whatever.  Everyone knows that when
dealing with realtime constraints the important case is not the average
but the worst.
In a live audio situation an xrun storm and a complete system lockup are
both catastrophic failures.
