The identd wot I wrote is still fast as anything on 2.4 :)
As you can see from this teeny sample of my ident log, I take just a little
over 1/100th of a second to respond (on average). :)

By the way, the intention of my ident server was not to be fast, but just to be
a little simpler and less over-engineered than pidentd, and not to give out any
site-specific information (uid's etc).  The speed was a bonus.
