This is a failure to connect! The socket is therefore not ready for
writing  or reading -ever. This behavior may not be correct, not
because of a failure to set the POLLOUT bit, but because the POLLIN
bit is set. Check if this is really true. I can't duplicate this
on 2.4.18 here because it's hard to get a deferred connect with my
setup.
