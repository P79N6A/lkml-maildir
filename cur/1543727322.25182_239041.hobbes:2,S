Wouldn't this be safer with a bit of locking? 
Even if the current code works lockless it would be more safer
for long term mainteance.

Shouldn't these be long instead of int?

I remember writing very similar, but simpler code for NUMA API
regions. The PAT patches also have similar code. 
It's also tricky to get right.
Maybe it would be time to move variable length region list handling
into a nice library in lib/, so that it can be used by other users.
