Then surely you have enough clue to do your own web surf for DocBook 
information. One way would be to randomly select a disto, and see what 
they install to make it work.

Let's take the Debian example. The Makefiles state that I need db2html to 
convert to your chosen HTML format. db2html is provided by docbook-utils, 
which it would seems installs the files listed publically at:
http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?word=docbook-utils&searchmode=filelist&case=insensitive&version=unstable&arch=i386
Now, it turns out that docbook-utils is the name of the open source 
package, as well as the Debian package:
http://freshmeat.net/projects/docbook-utils/
So, I guess that tells you what to install.

Dude, he was just trying to ask what distro you use, in order to help you 
out. Of course how you install it changes based on the distro you're 
using.

Given than most Linux distros are open source themselves, and that the 
documentation for many of them is open, perhaps we should all now take an 
opportunity to reflect on how non-sensical this statement is. Did you also 
consider that a bunch of this documentation is available pre-built on the 
web? For example, a bunch of the kernel API man pages can be found at:

FreeBSD? OpenBSD? NetBSD? Minix? I recommend you look through the list at 
http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au
 if you really feel the urge to move on.
Cheers,
