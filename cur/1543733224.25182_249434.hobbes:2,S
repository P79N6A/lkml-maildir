Sure.

Not to me :P
I think doing it just in time with kswapd and watermarks like we
do for order 0 allocations should be fine.
If you think of kswapd as "do the same freeing work the allocator
will otherwise have to" and "provide a context for doing freeing
work if the allocator can't" (in the !wait case)... then I think my
changes are pretty logical.
I think I confused everybody in the first email - we *do not* try
to heed any order-3 and above watermarks if we're only doing order-2
and below allocations... maybe this was the sticking point?
