That's what I wonder about. What exactly are the criteria for getting 
something in the kernel? People who want it, and someone willing to maintain 
it are part of it, I guess... Good design? The Right Thing, The Right Way?
Now I wouldn't say Andrew is 'nobody', and if he objects, that's something for 
sure. But he doesn't even object (do you?).
I like swap prefetch, and it works for me. I can patch it in myself, so its 
not all that important to me. And its just a small thing. But many small 
things...
