Ok, your call.

I disagree a little here. It may not really matter to you if you get a
report of a crash or if you get a report that mconf spewed an error
message, but to the user who experiences it (should it ever happen)
there's a difference - it's either "the damn thing crashed on me, what
a piece of crap" or "the damn thing crashed on me, but at least it
told me something went wrong, so now I can report it"... Printing an
error and exiting cleanly is IMHO always preferable to a crash - users
respond better to that and it's the "right" thing to do.
What about the other bits of the patch? are those OK?
Want me to send an updated patch - or?
