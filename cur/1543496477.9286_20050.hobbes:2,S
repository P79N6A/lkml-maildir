In my wonderful book ("ISA System Architecture") by Shanley and Anderson, it
says:
- it's a Motorola MC146818, or (more often these days) a clone from Dallas
Semiconductor
- you can read and write bit 0 of byte 0Bh to set/clear the DST bit.  So you
can use
  outb(0x0b, 0x70)
  dst = (inb(0x71) & 1)
There's also a BIOS call (INT 1Ah AH=2(read) 3(write)) which gets/sets the
date/time.  You can get it, set the low bit of DL to 1, optionally subtract
an hour, and set it.
Unfortunately, on my Dell machine anyway, the DST bit gets reset to zero,
probably the BIOS, across a warm boot...
