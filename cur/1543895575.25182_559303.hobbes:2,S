Subject: [patch #2 0/6] [#2] SM501 updates
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/18/401

Add documentation missed in the SM501 submission
and fix some minor problems that have been found
whilst testing.
This series has the minor typo in the clock
patch found by Mariusz Kozlowski <m.kozlowski@tuxland.pl>
I hope this series is suitable for application as
bugfixes before the next merge window.
