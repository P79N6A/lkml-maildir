FS will refuse to mount. Or kernel will panic (depends on some stuff).
If s->s_blocksize is zeroed, kernel will hang, as you correctly noticed.

What if overheated CPU will cause a bitflip exactly after such checks?
You cannot protect against broken hardware. Such problems should be
fixed by fsck.

journal header in reiserfs only occupies first 20 bytes of the block,
since this fells within 1st 512 bytes hardware sector, it will be written
atomically, I presume.
