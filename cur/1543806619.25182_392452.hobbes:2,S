Yes, in amd76x case it's just to enable the C states. Then at least
Fujitsu Lifebook p2120 needs patching of a register to stay in C2 
and C3 sleep, otherwise it just wakes up right away. These are just
some random machines I've been using, so there's probably quite a
few machines that could use some fixups.
What would be nice would be some hooks in ACPI to scan the north and
south bridges based on some fixup list during init, and then do the
necessary fixups would be nice. And then ACPI C states would just
work!

Tony
