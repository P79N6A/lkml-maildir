Hi,
I'd like for kbuild to default ARCH to the already-symlinked
arch in include/asm-$(ARCH) if ARCH is not specified on the
command line or in the environment.  I have a non-working patch,
complete with a circular dependency which is dropped:
make: Circular ' <- ' dependency dropped.
Any suggestions for how to complete this?
Thanks.

If ARCH is unspecified (command line or environment) and if
include/asm is already a symlink to include/asm-$ARCH,
use that ARCH as the default instead of the host ARCH.
Undo the effect of this by using 'make mrproper' or just 'rm include/asm'.
This allows us to drop 'ARCH=fobr' for subsequent builds of the same
ARCH, after using it in a build one time (not counting make *config).
