Well I dunno if a WaveSwitch is 802.11 (sounds like it might
be), so if it is, I had an identical problem - look under wireless
ethernet at
  
http://www.alex.org.uk/T23
Various firmware upgrades fixed it, and crucially a settings
changed, fixed it. Your symptoms sound identical to mine
(and if so it's the basestation you have to fix). Short answer
is change to rfc1042 encapsulation from 802.1h, which (seemingly
illegally) works at 1500 byte MTUs only between some hardware
pairs.
