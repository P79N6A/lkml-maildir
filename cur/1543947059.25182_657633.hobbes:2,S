I should then add support for something like:
checkflags-y := -D__CHECK_ENDIAN__
to match the style of the rest.
I do not like all the buried in assumption about the
global variables.
But I would prefer that someone would spend a few days looking into the
warnings generated with sparse.
Dedicating a few hours/day in a week could help a lot here if
one understand the warnings.
What I see is that people mindlessly add code that introduce
new sparse warnings without noticing simply due to the
massive amount of warnings generated.
