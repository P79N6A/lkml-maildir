If nobody can explain to me the perfomance impact of patch, maybe the 
patch isn't so understandable in first place?
I could also have asked how that code scales up, e.g. how much more work 
has to be done for a thousand Linux images. (AFAICR this question also 
came up in the context of tickless systems).
This patch is really damned hard to read as it changes too many things at 
once. Maybe it does some necessary cleanups, but they are hard see, as 
they pretty much get lost in all the functional changes.
I'm pretty close to suggest to reject this patch until it clearly 
separates new functionality from cleanups. If the current system is broken 
fix it first, if the current system is a mess clean it up first, but 
don't mix these two steps, unless you want to introduce more broken mess.
bye, Roman
