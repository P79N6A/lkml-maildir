   It seems that pci_dma_sync_*() transfers ownership in either direction.
That's a bug in the documentation, and no platform which has to care
about this area actually does what you imply.
A new interface needs to be added to transfer control in the other
direction.  pci_dma_sync_*() only handles transferring control from
device to CPU..
I know this makes drivers like eepro100 buggy, this was discussed
a month or two ago wrt. MIPS on linux-kernel, check the archives
for the thread.
