Since the addition of an RO_COMPAT field requires that e2fsprogs be fixed
to understand this change (and to validate that the i_blocks_high value
is sane, relative to the i_size) there is no harm in using the i_frag and
i_fsize fields.  If you look at current e2fsck code, it _requires_ that
i_frag and i_fsize are zero so they could not possibly be used for anything.
Having a 16-bit field for the i_blocks_high is enough and is guaranteed not
to conflict with HURD.

1) Please wrap lines at 80 characters
2) This check should actually be done at i_blocks > 0xffffffffULL instead of
   being related to the file size.  It should be possible to have large
   sparse files that do not cause this feature flag to be invoked.
3) The feature should be called something like "RO_COMPAT_MANY_BLOCKS" or
   similar, since it isn't necessarily related to 4TB file sizes.
4) It is better to keep this feature independent from RO_COMPAT_LARGE_FILE,
   since that is related to i_size.  Just do two separate tests here.

This doesn't make sense.  The earlier checks already provide the correct
limits based on indirect blocks (although it would be good to independently
verify that).  With your patch we are not limited to 4TB at all (think larger
block sizes) so there is no reason to add this extra limit.

                                        ^^^ 4TB (or more with blocksize
					         larger than 4kB on 64-bit
						 systems)
