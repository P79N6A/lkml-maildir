One of busybox's users has a libc built with improperly sanitized kernel 
headers that leak all the kernel's CONFIG_ symbols into the standard 
namespace, and we found out because one of them clashes with a busybox CONFIG 
symbol and it broke his build.
The easiest thing to do was rename our CONFIG symbol, which we did.  (And 
asked him to fix his system, which he didn't.)  This was a while ago now...

I've been cc'd on all this because I cared about Mazur's kernel headers enough 
to email him several times.  But I can't say I really care about this new 
project that's taken over the discussion.
Either it doesn't break the existing interface, in which case it has no impact 
on me and I can ignore it, or it requires all existing userspace programs 
that care about the current state of things to change to care about your new 
thing instead, in which case it's probably doomed.  Unless the kernel picks 
it up and imposes a flag day, at which point I'll find out about it from LWN 
like everybody else.
Either way, it's not sounding like something I can grab and build uClibc 
systems with any time soon, the way I could use Mazur's headers to build 
uClibc.  I'll probably wind up using the gentoo headers when the 2.6.14 
version ships.

*shrug*.  Good luck with whatever it is you're trying to accomplish.
