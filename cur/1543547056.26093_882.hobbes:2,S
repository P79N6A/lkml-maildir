Subject: Upgrading a 2.2.14-5.0 kernel to 2.2.16-3 kernel

I haven't been able to receive an answer from RedHat on this :o(
We have a Dell PowerEdge server runninng RH 6.0 with the RH 2.2.14-5.0
kernel. Now, I am aware there are some security issues with the 2.2.14
kernel, however our Dell server requires the use of the third party
MegaTrends RAID driver which is loaded through initrd.
Will upgrading the kernel to 2.2.16-3 affect the initrd image? Or will I
have to reinstall the initrd image with it?
It's particularly important because if the MegaTrend driver isn't
correctly installed we will have a dead server!
Cheers,
Alex.
