You don't have to use rsync, and you don't have to go outside the system. 
That was my point: you can use "git-ssh-pull" to pull the tags.
But yes, you have to explicitly ask for them by name, ie the other side 
has to let you know: "Oh, btw, I created a 'xyz' tag for you". And having 
another helper script to hide the details of how git-*-pull handles tags 
is obviously also a good idea, although it's pretty low on my list of 
things to worry about.
