The basic idea is to insert probes on user applications which may or
may not be in memory, at the time of probe insertion.
The base interface patch (1/3) allows the user to insert the probes on the
text pages that are already present in the memory. This is done by mapping
the page via kmap() and then insert the breakpoint instruction at the given
page offset.
Then comes the issue of inserting a probe on pages not currently in
memory. This is useful if we'd want to probe an application that hasn't
yet started executing. In such situations, we still want to insert the
probe, but defer insertion of actual probe until the text page is read
into the memory.
Here are a few ways to accomplish this:
1. Add a notifier in the readpage(), readpages() routine, which will
   notify when the text pages are read into the memory.
2. Reading the page from the executable into memory and then insert
   probes on that text page. But there are situations where the system
   can run into low memory problems and those text pages get discarded.
3. Change the readpage() and readpages() routines only for that application
   where probes will be inserted. This is done by hooking the readpage()
   and readpages() routines, which is limited to the probed application
   and will not change anything related to other applications.
The current patchset uses approach 3.
I'd like to know if there are better/cleaner ways to accomplish this?
Thanks
Prasanna
