   I did this a while back. The required changes to NFS become one
   liners.  Attached (all but the NFS changes).
Personally I don't think that adding a lookup method is the
way to go.  Simply because it does require changes at the call sites.
If you add the logic to kmem_cache_create itself, you require no
changes, you just return the found kmem_cache_t instead of creating a
new one.  I think this is much simpler.
I do totally agree with the strdup changes, I never realized that, how
silly to have multiple implementations. :-)
