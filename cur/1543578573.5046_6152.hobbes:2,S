Two things:
Structures used in ioctls should have explicit sizes (eg u32, not unsigned
long). Remember on sparc64 we have a 32 bit userspace and 64 bit kernel.
Having pointers to other structures is considered bad form again due to the
32bit/64bit differences. Think 32 bit pointers vs 64 bit pointers :)
When either of these happen we have to write up translation code. Of
the two, having pointers to other structs is definitely the worst.
