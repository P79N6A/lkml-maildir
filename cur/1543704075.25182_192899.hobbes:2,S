	I tried out 2.6.2-rc1 today, and saw some very strange behavior
with Java.  I run a 30s build process (Java/Ant), and it would basically
stop in the middle.  If I run a "top" next to it (this was all in X),
during the pauses, the CPUs would go down to nearly 100% idle, and all the
Java processes disappeared from the top of the list.  If I moved my mouse
at all, the Java build would wake up for a bit, then stop again 10 or 15
seconds later.  The build would easily take several minutes if I didn't
move my mouse much (or hang indefinitely if I didn't move my mouse at
all).  If I consistently jiggled my mouse through the entire build, the
performance was approximately what I would expect (35-40s).
	I tried the same thing under my normal kernel (SuSE
2.4.21-178-smp) and the build ran continuously with no pauses (35s).
	The pauses on 2.6.2-rc1 occured with both 32-bit (Sun) and 64-bit
(Blackdown) Java implementations.
	I can't explain it, but if there's any pertinent info I can
provide, I'll be happy to.
Thanks,
	Aaron
