Its 100% copied from the networking code. I would have thought we really
want that behaviour, if Im on a serial console I can only tolerate a
decent sized backtrace every few seconds. If I allow 10 bursts every 5
seconds then im screwed.
Instead we allow the burst of 10 once but then ratelimit it to one
per 5 seconds until we have had a long enough period of silence. The
main thing is that over the long term we have an average of one message
per 5 seconds.
