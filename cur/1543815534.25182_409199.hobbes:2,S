Ok. I wasn't sure that the latest libata merge had merged everything that

Yes, just testing the current git tree (and if you're not a git user, just 
waiting for the next nightly snapshot) sounds like the appropriate thing 
to do.
Maybe back-porting any critical sata_mv fixes to 2.6.16.x is appropriate, 
considering that I don't think RH or SuSE will necessarily want to pull 
the whole thing.
