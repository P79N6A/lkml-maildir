Do you use ACPI-based idling? If so, in which state is the CPU in (cat
/proc/acpi/processor/*/power ? I suspect that you do not use ACPI (else 
you wouldn't need the table-based approach) or that the ACPI-based idling is
broken on your notebook; as then the Linux idle handler  only makes use of 
"hlt" (IIRC), that is ACPI C1, while throttling "forces" ACPI C2 (again
 IIRC).
