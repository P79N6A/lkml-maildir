In 2.6, the "agpgart" module is just the core.  Without a gart driver 
loaded (via-agp for example), it does nothing.  If you really don't want 
to have the hard dependency on agpgart, make the code using it 
conditionally compile on CONFIG_AGP or something.

symbol_get in it's current form is hard-coded to look for GPL symbols, 
hence it is exported GPL only.  I have a rough patch that will allow 
symbol_get to use the license status of its caller to determine which 
symbols it can find.  However this depends on whether or not 
symbol_get() is removed like some people want.
