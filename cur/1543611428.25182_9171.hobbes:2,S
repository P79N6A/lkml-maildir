Have you audited all the tty drivers in 2.4 to make sure that they clean
up safely?
I don't believe the serial code will clean up safely as it stands for
starters if block_til_ready in serial.c fails, leaving an interrupt
in use.  Further attempts to open the serial device will probably fail.
Try this as any user with your patch applied:
$ stty -clocal -F /dev/ttyS0
$ cat /proc/interrupts
$ cat /dev/ttyS0
^c
$ cat /proc/interrupts
I think you'll find your serial port interrupt is still claimed, despite
the module being marked as not in use.
