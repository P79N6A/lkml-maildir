Subject: [2.5.46] Problems with vfat mount umask on directories

'llo list.
This morning I discovered I no longer could write on my vfat data partition as 
a normal user. The following line is present in /etc/fstab (and has worked 
before with atleast 2.5.40 and each and every 2.4 kernel I used)
/dev/hda7   /mnt/data      vfat      defaults,gid=103,umask=007       0 0
which gives the partition a mask of 770 to all users in gid 103 (which is 
conveniently named fat32). I myself as user devilkin am in this group...
Yet, the directory is still:
07:22:56 root@laptop:/mnt# ls -ld data
drwxr-xr-x    9 root     fat32       16384 Jan  1  1970 data
(and where the hell did that date come from??)
The permissioning on the files inside this directory seems correct, but for 
the directories it is wrong:
-rwxrwx---    1 root     fat32         313 May 27 12:32 afile.ini*
drwxr-xr-x    3 root     fat32       16384 Aug 22 13:01 adir/
which denies me the write rights I need.
Did something change on the fat/vfat/... layer that can cause this to no 
longer function?
If you need some more info, just yell... I hope this issue can be resolved.
