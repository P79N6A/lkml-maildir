You don't really provide enough information. However, the hint I see
is 'Process swapper'. It looks as though there was a page-fault when
the kernel was in an interrupt.
This could happen if you are trying to copy to user from within an
interrupt or something similar.
If your 'transport layer' code executes off from an interrupt, you
could be in trouble; "Don't do that!". You have to buffer interrupt
stuff somewhere to access it later in a user context.
