I'm really really sorry for asking such a seemingly stupid question, but
I'm having a very severe issue here and I can't seem to figure out the
fix. 
If someone could exchange emails with me for a few mins I'd be very
grateful. I see that I have max_scsi_luns in my System.map, but I cannot
see luns > 8(0-7) with 2.4.19-pre10. The same driver set works with the
default RH installed kernel(2.4.9). So it leads me to believe that
putting max_scsi_luns=128 (or even 16) in grub.conf isn't being
effective. 
Please help.
