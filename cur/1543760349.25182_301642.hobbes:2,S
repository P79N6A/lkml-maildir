a few questions
1) Why is this a config option; if it's useful it should just be always
on really
2) Can you explain briefly what this is useful for?
3) How does this work for existing stuff if, say, your dhcp lease
changes and your machine no longer owns a certain IP, what will happen
to the tasks?
4) if a machine has multiple IPs.. which one is chosen ?
