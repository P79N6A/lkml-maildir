Subject: [PATCH] 0/5 Fix Summit support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This sequence makes Summit finally work properly - most of the code
was originally written by James Cleverdon, and it has been split up
and cleaned up by John Stultz and I.
I've tested these on UP, standard SMP, NUMA-Q and Summit, and have
test-compiled them for UP+IO-APIC as well. They should change nothing
at all for standard machines.
Please apply, thanks,
Martin.
