Do you mean uninitialized hardware? That shouldn't be a problem, since
older kernels (e.g. 2.6.19 with platform patches for arch/ppc) are running
fine.

That's a little bit of a problem. The kernel log in memory doesn't show
any kernel oops, but is also fragmented (small fragments seem to have been
overwritten with 0x0). I could extract it by using the U-boot firmware,
but that takes some time, as the serial console is not yet working.
I tried to boot the kernel with 512MB and 1.5GB RAM. The amount of memory
doesn't have any effect and the amount of memory is reported correctly
in the kernel log.

Well, I can't answer this question. The kernel currently locks up when
loading the INIT program. But that is another problem (I still have to
bisect it) and doesn't seem to be related to this problem.
Thanks for your help!
