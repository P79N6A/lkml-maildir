I'd like to be able to catch certain processes just before they sleep
on file IO. Ideally, I could catch only those sleeping on read calls,
but catching everything and being able to sort out what's happening in
my handler would be okay too.
Basically, I have a process flag (call it PF_MONKEY for now), and I'd
like to call monkey_about_to_sleep() when a process with PF_MONKEY set 
goes to sleep waiting for a file read to complete.
I've thought about trawling through the fs and block code and tagging
all the 'current->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE; schedule()' cases, but 
that seems both error-prone and hideously ugly. Really, the individual 
filesystem and device drivers shouldn't have to care about PF_MONKEY
processes. Is there a better way?
Can I, for example, figure out _why_ 'current' has gone from
TASK_RUNNING to TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE inside of schedule()?
I'm looking through 2.3.32pre2, btw.
Thanks.
