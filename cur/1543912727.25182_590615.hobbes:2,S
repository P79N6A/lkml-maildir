Can you cc the next version to Linus please? He's probably best qualified
to review the i386 double fault handler because he wrote it originally.
I must admit the code always scared me a bit.

I really wonder if there isn't a cleaner way to do that :-( These init reference checks
are starting to become a major annoyance.

Would it be that bad to have the TSS even around without CONFIG_DOUBLEFAULT?
In fact I would prefer to just eliminate CONFIG_DOUBLEFAULT (imho 
it always a bad idea because the amount of code it saves is miniscule) instead of 
adding such a ifdef maze.

BUILD_BUG_ON would look nicer

If you move the code after the gs pda setup you could use smp_processor_id() and
avoid the ifdefs (on UP it expands to 0 so the optimizer would do it cleanly)

In 2.4-aa I added a alloc_pages_exact() for this. I don't think such games should
be played outside page_alloc.c. I would recommend to readd alloc_pages_exact()
and then use it.

Can't you just move that to a proper argument register in assembler code?
