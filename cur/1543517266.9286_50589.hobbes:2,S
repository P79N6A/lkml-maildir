Maybe you have exceeded the allowed cable length chaining your scanner to the scsi bus.
I am having the same problem after I added a HP scanner to my SCSI bus.
Temporarily I have configured my SCSI controller to initiate synchronous transfers with at most 10MBit/s transfer rate until I get a second SCSI controller for my external devices.
