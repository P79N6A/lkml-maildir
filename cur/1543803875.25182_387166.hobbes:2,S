That is a function of how RAID5 works.  A properly configured RAID5 array 
will have a spare disk to take over in case one of the members fails, as 
otherwise you run a serious risk of not being able to recover any data.

Underlying disks should not be experiencing transient failures.  Are you 
sure the problem isn't with the disk controller you're building your array 
on top of?  At the very least any bug report requires that information to 
be able to provide even a basic analysis of what is going wrong.
Personally, I am of the opinion that RAID5 should not be used by the 
vast majority of people as the failure modes it entails are far too 
complex for most people to cope with.
