I'm actually handling that one now.  It came over to me when I started adding
the actual KNI based optimizations into the kernel (copy_*_user, memcpy,
memset are the main things, but also a kni based xor routine for the raid5
code).  I'm close to done, but the major thing that isn't complete is a
handler for the new floating point exception on PIII CPUs.
If anyone out there can find docs on this new exception, it would be very
handy :)  I looked all through my PIII manuals and found references to
instructions that would result in the new exception being generated, but
nothing in there that details what the exception exactly is and how to handle
it.
