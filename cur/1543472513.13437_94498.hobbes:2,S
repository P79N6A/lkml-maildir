No, it's not.  Formatting ("low level format") and making a filesystem
("high level format") are two fundamentally different things; in DOS,
the FORMAT command does them both for floppies, but not for hard disks
(FORMAT only makes the filesystem on a hard disk.)
In Linux, the formatting is traditionally done with the fdformat
command and making the filesystem with mkfs.<filesystem> for some
value of <filesystem>.

That seems unlikely, especially since different systems use different
magnetic modulation methods.
Anyway, if fdformat doesn't work on LS-120 drives, then either
fdformat, the kernel, or both needs to be updated.  LS-120, being a
SCSI or ATAPI device, presumably only needs the high level FORMAT UNIT
command sent to it with the appropriate parameters.
