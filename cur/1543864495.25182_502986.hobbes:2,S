okay, after integrating this into two Linux-VServer
branches and some testing, I can confirm that it 
_seems_ to fix the nfs and related issues, but still, 
I do not like it :)
here my issues with this approach:
 - the code is quite hard to read and can easily
   lead to unexpected issues when spaces are
   manipulated
 - it breaks the basic get/put refcounting for
   nsproxy references outside the task struct
   i.e. we had to add a vs_put_nsproxy() which
   does what the put_nsproxy() did before, to
   keep and handle a reference to the nsproxy 
   from the context structure
 - the following scenario might become a problem
   for future spaces (especially the pid space?)
            A                       B
 exit_task_namespaces_early()
			exit_task_namespaces_early()
			exit_notify()
			exit_task_namespaces()
 ---------------------------------------------------
 exit_notify()
 exit_task_namespaces()
note: I still consider it the best available fix
for this issues, especially as 2.6.20 is in a 
late rc stage ... but IMHO the nfs threads should
be modified to handle the nsproxy disposal properly

he did, looks like it works fine with vanilla too
(even when stressing the described cornercase)
best,
