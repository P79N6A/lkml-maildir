Currently menuconfig makes it a very difficult job to undo a select.
Homework: try to do "make allmodconfig" and then set CONFIG_HOTPLUG=n
You will be hit by CONFIG_FW_LOADER that is 'selected' by many
instances - and then it becomes very difficult.
So until menuconfig has better support for undoing select the rule of
thumb outlined by Adrian is true.
