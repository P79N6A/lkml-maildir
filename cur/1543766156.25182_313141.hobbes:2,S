Disk space issues?  A complete git repository of the Linux kernel with
all changesets back to 2.4.0 takes just over 3G ... which is big compared
to BK, but 3G of disk only costs about $1 (for IDE ... if you want 15K rpm
SCSI, then you'll pay a lot more).  Network bandwidth is likely to be a
bigger problem.
There's a prototype web i/f at 
http://grmso.net:8090/
 that's already looking
fairly slick.
