I agree with you for the most part.
Flexibility is pretty easy to maintain, and you seem to
alude to this, by allowing the jiffies_32 thing to have
a configurable type.
With this in mind maybe it's better to give the type some other more
descriptive name, something that states what the type represents,
rather than it's likely implementation :-)
