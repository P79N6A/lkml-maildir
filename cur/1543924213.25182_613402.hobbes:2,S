As part of Linux Kernel Driver DataBase, yesterday I "solved"
also this problem:
From a module name, I can obtain relative the kernel
configuration item.
You can see the result in 
http://cateee.net/lkddb
(grep '^drv module' drivers-db). I count 2570 such items.
But I've some problems on few cases:
sometime there is one module name with more CONFIG_s.
Normally such cases happens in modules on the same directory,
as support module or as parent module.
I don't see a method to distinguish the right (minimal)
configuration.
One solution would be to remove some dependencies on
Makefile, and checking and ev. creating such dependencies
on Kconfig. But this require a kernel modification.
Or you think there is a better (non-invasive) method?
