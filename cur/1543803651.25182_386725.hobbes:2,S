I've also seen this problem with a faulty case where a small metal  
support shorted a couple pins on the PCI riser.  It gave odd PCI ids,  
corrupted data, and crashed within a minute of booting.  After  
removing the metal bracket, it's been stable for almost a year.

I have yet to see any problem, however complicated, which, when you  
looked at it in the right way, did not become still more complicated.
