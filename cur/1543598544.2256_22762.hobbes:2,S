	No, because 'select' is defined to work the same on both blocking and
non-blocking sockets. Roughly, select should hit on read if a non-blocking
read wouldn't return 'would block'.

	So is reading from a closed or errored socket. There is nothing to wait
for, so why should the system call wait?

	If you think about the cases where someone might actually do this, odds are
you want the application's error handling code to launch. That won't happen
if you never break out of select. However, if you do break out of select, do
a read, and get an error, the problem will then be handled, rather than
ignored.
