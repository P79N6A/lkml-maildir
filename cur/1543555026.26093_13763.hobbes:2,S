Compile a kernel, marking "sx" and "riscom8" as modules. 
Install, modprobe sx, and voila, you'll pull in the riscom because
its "block_til_ready" static was found to satisfy the block_til_ready
from generic_serial. 
We're working on renaming the one in generic_serial to
"gs_block_til_ready", but haven't checked yet if the patch got
applied. So you may have to use a "month-old" kernel for this test.
