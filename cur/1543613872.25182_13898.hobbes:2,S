Ok, people asked :)
It can be found at:
	
http://www.kroah.com/linux/usb/linux-2.4.17-rc2-gregkh-1.patch.gz
I've backported a number of the small 2.5.1 changes into this tree (the
new drivers, and the usb_fill_bulk_*_urb() functions and documentation.)
I haven't backported the USB 2.0 changes here.  If you want to play with
USB 2.0 devices, you have to use the 2.5 tree.
Again, if anyone notices any missing patches that should be in here,
please let me know.
thanks,
greg k-h
