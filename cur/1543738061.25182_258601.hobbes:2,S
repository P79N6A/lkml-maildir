For me, this one wants to panic on boot when trying to find the root 
filesystem. Acts like either the aic7xxx module is missing (which I 
don't think is the case) or hosed, or it's having trouble with the label 
for the root partition (Fedora system). Will investigate further when I 
get home tonight, unless something jumps out at anyone.
