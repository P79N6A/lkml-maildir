	You didn't say how you declared the array or what the element
size was.  If the array elements were larger than a char, by saying an
array of size 2048, do you mean in bytes or in array elements?
	You also didn't say where you called your module from.  Was it
in an interrupt handler or at insmod time or from a system call.
	If it was a automatic array on the stack (declared inside the
function and not declared static), you probably overflowed the stack.
