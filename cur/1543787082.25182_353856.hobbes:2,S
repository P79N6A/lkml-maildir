You can solve it just as well in kernel space without application
changes. Given a refcounted structure something like
	struct pidref {
		atomic_t ref;
		struct pidref *next, *prev;
		pid_t pid;
	};
and a hash you can take a pid reference whenever you hang onto a pid in
kernel space and check what should be a tiny if not empty hash in the
normal cases whenever you allocate a pid.
