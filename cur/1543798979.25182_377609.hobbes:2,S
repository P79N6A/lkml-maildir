Sometimes what'll happen is that the daemon (or kernel component) that
services requests on an RPC port will die or otherwise stop servicing
requests, but I believe there's nothing in the portmapper or rpcbind
daemon(s) that will periodically poll to see if those requests are still
being serviced.
I'd hop over to another machine that is advertising the same service,
and use this URL:
http://dcs.nac.uci.edu/~strombrg/What-program-is-active-on-that-port.html
...to see what -should- be handling those requests, and then check on
that same facility on the host having trouble.
