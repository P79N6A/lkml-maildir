   Generally not with such a small rev difference.  You could try the 
latest driver, and firmware in the 7.7.  The driver source is on the Red 
Hat drivers disk.  You should be able to drop in the .c, and .h in 
drivers/scsi, and recompile.

PS- Personally I'd suspect an XFS bug.  Try reiserfs.  I've been running 
2.4.23pres, and 2.4.23 on hundreds of 3ware of numerous different types. 
  With no issue with the prior firmware release.
