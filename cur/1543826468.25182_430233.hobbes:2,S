This _is_ really a bug. strncpy() pads the remaining bytes of dest with
zeroes, which destroys parts of the v4l2_standard structure (in
particular, the v4l2_fract substructure). I'd suggest not to use
strcpy() although it's safe here -- until someone changes the structure
sizes.
Kind regards,
 Horst
