My experience is that, on some laptops, the code at c000:0003 may jump 
into some other address block that isn't necessarily shadowed. There's 
no reason to assume that POSTing an ancilliary ROM will work after the 
system has left the BIOS. Further, my laptop doesn't appear to have a 
rom entry in sysfs, which makes getting at stuff that way rather more 
awkward...
