Heh.. I haven't instrumented it yet, but I did discover a bit more about it:
The Power-Off_Retract_Count incrmenents *only* when there's data in the
on-drive write-cache.  So if I haven't written anything significantly large
before suspending, then it often does NOT increment the retract counter.
But if I copy a couple of multi-MB files around and then suspend (to RAM),
the retract count gets incremented.
So I've now just stuck "hdparm -F /dev/sda" into my suspend script,
and that cures the problem completely for me.  "-F" does a FLUSH_CACHE,
and requires a recent copy of hdparm.
Perhaps libata should also do a FLUSH_CACHE before any STANDBYNOW command,
prior to entering STR, which is what my script is currently now doing..
I'll instrument libata and see what the current sequence is.
