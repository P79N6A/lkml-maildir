Hi,
  i am studing a driver's code.
  i have added a line printk (KERN_DEBUG __FUNCTION)  which is supposed to
  print the name of the function.
  I want to trace the program - what is happening.
  When i see the output of the driver using dmesg
  Only some of the prints are visible (some of them are not printed
even though they
   must get printed. i dont know why this is happening.
  Is there any limit on printk (like number of messages....)
  How do i disable (ie printk should print irrespective of any limit
or anything).
  Regard,,
   sriram
