Well I dunno about you lot but this is the system I have worked up
for myself :)
after applying the appropriate patch:
make oldconfig
../compile
cd /boot
./newkern <version>-<build>
and bang. I'm set. what the scripts do is the following:
compile:
#!/bin/bash
make clean && \
make dep && \
make bzlilo && \
make modules && \
make modules_install && \
depmod -va
newkern:
#!/bin/bash
# Usage: newkern <version>-<build>
mv -v /vmlinuz /boot/vmlinuz-$1 && \
mv -v /System.map /boot/System.map-$1 && \
mv -v /boot/vmlinuz.old /boot/vmlinuz.ancient && \
mv -v /boot/vmlinuz /boot/vmlinuz.old && \
mv -v /boot/System.old /boot/System.ancient && \
mv -v /boot/System.map /boot/System.old && \
cp -v /usr/src/linux/.config /boot/.config-$1 && \
ln -vs vmlinuz-$1 /boot/vmlinuz && \
ln -vs System.map-$1 /boot/System.map && \
lilo -v
With lilo.conf having 3 predefined boot sections:
linux for the vmlinuz kernel with l as an alias
linux.old for the vmlinuz.old kernel with o as an alias
linux.ancient for the vmlinuz.ancient kernel with a as an alias
This gives me 3 kernel versions to boot from in case varied amounts
of poo happen when compiling new ones. :) It also helps me not forget
about the modules bit (even though the only ones I have are for ppp
compression... I'm a monolithic kinda guy :)
What this gives me is a simple way of keeping my kernel, System.map
and .config files in sync so that, barring HD booboo's ;) I can bounce
back and forth between versions and always get what I want. And when
I feel like it, I can back it up to floppy if need be (or cdrom or
tape or whatnot) so that HD booboos don't get as damaging.
No need to really mod the kernel (but I can see the attraction).
