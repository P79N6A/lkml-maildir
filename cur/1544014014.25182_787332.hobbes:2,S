Actually, that's a different problem.   It's fixed in the patch:
ext4: Fix race between read_block_bitmap() and mark_diskspace_used()
in the ext4 patch queue (filename:
fix-race-between-read_block_bitmap-and-mark_diskspace_used) and in the
2.6.28-ext4-1 patch set.  I'm about to push it to Linus, and I'll make
sure it's queued for the 2.6.28.1 stable truee.
