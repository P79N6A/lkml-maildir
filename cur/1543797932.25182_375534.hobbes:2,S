in that sense i'm all for going for the 300K patch, which is roughly the 
direction David is heading into: rename to 'struct mutex' but keep the 
down/up APIs, and introduce sem_down()/sem_up()/ for the cases that need 
full semaphores.
i dont think the 3000K patch (full API rename, introduction of 
mutex_down()/mutex_up()) is realistic.
