It goes in lib/lib.a.  The linker will only pick up
the default version if the architecture doesn't
have its own dump_stack().
bust_spinlocks() has worked that way for quite some time.

Yup.  But it's nice to be able to slot the default version
into lib.a.   In the bust_spinlocks case, architectures only
need to implement a version if they have special needs.
