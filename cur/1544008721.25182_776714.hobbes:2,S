I had overlooked that do_notify_parent() call.

I had not looked into the bowels of various __wake_up variants, just
assumed it would stay as it is and use wake_up_interruptible_sync.
That would certainly be cleaner.  Then do_wait_wake_function would not need
the second of its special cases, only the one double-check for the
thread_group_leader && task_detached case.
I don't see an exposed __wake_up* variant that both passes a "key" pointer
through and does "sync".  For __wake_up_parent, "sync" is quite desireable.

Why?  The do_wait loop will have to go through again and still might just
sleep again.  The explicit remove at the end of do_wait seems fine to me.
Thanks,
