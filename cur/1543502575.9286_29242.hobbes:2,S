It's been fixed.  There wasn't any more to do than make it compile,
really, since it currently only works for PC-style ports and goes straight
for the hardware registers, bypassing parport.
And from looking at the code, imm is the same.
As for your scribble problem, I don't have any more ideas I'm afraid.
Tim.
