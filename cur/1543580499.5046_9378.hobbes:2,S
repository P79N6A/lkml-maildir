Possibly.  However the win (lower latency) from getting swapin
readahead is probably even bigger.  And you are throwing out the least
desirable pages in memory.

A better choice is probably to make certain the read and write paths are in
sync so that you can know the readahead is going to do you some good.
This is a little tricky though.  
Unless you can see a big performance win somewhere please don't submit
this to Linus for inclusion.
