Those magic numbers don't make any sense. In particular, SLAB_LIMIT is
clearly bogus both in the original version and in the "magic number
patch". The only place that uses SLAB_LIMIT is the code that decides how
many entries fit in one slab, and quite frankly, it makes no _sense_ to
have a SLAB_LIMIT that is big enough to be unsigned.
"SLAB_LIMIT" should be something in the few hundreds, maybe.
Manfred?  What is the logic behind those nonsensical numbers?
