Correct.  BSDs solved the problem by changing cwd on subsequent use of 
chroot; I think there's a better way.  I think the solution might be to 
add a "previous root", and restrict the process there as well as the new 
root.  That is, once cwd is set within the new root, that new root is 
the limit.  Prior to setting cwd within the new root, the previous root 
is the limit.
