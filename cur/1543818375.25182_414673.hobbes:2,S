Likewise for me.
Perhaps iptables could point to a document or a webpage (in case kernel is newer
than the userspace iptables, and has introduced new requirements) that lists
the kernel options that need to be enabled, instead of saying 
 failed iptables v1.3.5: can't initialize iptables table filter: iptables
 who? (do you need to insmod?)
Such verbosity might not be unixy, but during Old Unix times, thousands of people
weren't following -rc kernels...
