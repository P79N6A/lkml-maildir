Adrian,
Thanks for the info.  Our testing looked good too.
In the development tree for cifs we are working on reducing buffer usage 
(a good first
step is already checked in) and enabling additional important security 
features (NTLMv2 and
Kerberos for newer more secure clients and also an option to configure 
and mount for
allowing lanman and plaintext sessionsetup to allow mounts to older 
legacy servers).
