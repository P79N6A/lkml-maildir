Nope. I'm talking about the stuff in fs/nfsd/nfsfh.c: lookup_inode() and
get_parent_ino(). And yes, there is quite an interesting comment between
them ;-)

Oh, yes. We have all sorts of cruft in fs/*/*, no doubt. Stats on last
variant of rename patch - 388 lines in, 757 lines out. And that's after
similar stats from the previous runs. And much more can be cleaned up.
Lots of filesystems check for directory being directory. All of them
(except AFFS, damnit) check for the target of link() being non-directory
(instead of VFS doing that). nfsd/vfs.c duplicates namei.c big way.
Dealing with mknod() is duplicated in all filesystems that do it. Minixfs
and sysvfs do very interesting things in rename() and truncate(). Don't
get me started on FAT-dervied filesystems - wait for patch (when rename
stuff will stabilize). Let's not go into the amount of cruft included from
fs.h (embedded foo_inode_info and foo_sb_info).
	ObFoo_inode_info: would you object against defining FOO_I(x) as
&((x).u.foo_i) and doing corresponding replacements in filesystems' code?
I mean 1-to-1 replacement, giving the identical text after cpp. That alone
would make transition to externally allocated fs-specific parts much
easier when we'll finally go for it (there *is* a need for light-weight
inodes). I'm not talking about rename patch, indeed - it's completeley
separate story.
