Look for the 'load_idx' variable in find_busiest_group() and how it's used.
include/linux/topology.h (+ some architectures defines additional
node-definition-structures, but that's primarily for NUMA)
There you can find : 'busy_idx', 'idle_idx' and 'newidle_idx' (amongst
others that affect load-balancing).
Those parameters specify the _source_ of load for determining the
busiest group for !CPU_IDLE, CPU_IDLE and CPU_NEWLY_IDLE cases
respectively.
when 'load_idx == 0' (say, when CPU_NEWLY_IDLE and 'newidle_idx == 0'
or when CPU_IDLE and 'idle_idx == 0') the cpu_load[] table is _not_
taken into account by {source,target}_load(), and the raw load on the
rq is considered instead. In case of CPU_NEWLY_IDLE the raw load is
always 0 (no tasks on the queue).
so for NUMA, newidle_idx = 0 and it also seems to be a generic option
for other variants on 2.6.23.1. Hence, it doesn't matter how big are
cpu_load[], they are just not taken into account.

for NUMA, 'idle_idx != 0' (i.e. cpu_load[] is taken into account) for
the CPU_IDLE case
and
'newidle_idx == 0' (just because, SD_BALANCE_NEWIDLE is normally not
used on NUMA) for CPU_NEWLY_IDLE.

I guess, you meant it to be the other way aroumd -- 1101 when it's switched on.

(1) CPU_IDLE and idle_idx != 0 --> cpu_load[] is considered
(2) CPU_NEWIDLE and newidle_idx == 0 --> raw load is considered (which
is 0 in this case).

As you may see, there are varios node's configs in
include/linux/topology.h that affects load-balancing. Migrations
between NUMA nodes can be more expensive than e.g. between cpus on
'normal' SMP, multi-core, etc. So it should be about being more
conservative when doing load-balancing on some setups.
e.g. in your particular case, what happens is smth like this:
SD_BALANCE_NEWIDLE + newidle_idx == 0
cpu #0: 2 nice(0) cpu-hogs
cpu #1: nice(-15) blocks...
cpu #1: load_balance_newidle() is triggered  (*)
cpu #1: newidle_idx == 0 so the busiest group is on cpu #0
cpu #1: nice(0) (which is != current) is pulled over to cpu #1
cpu #1: nice(0) is running untill it's preempted by nice(-15)
cpu #1: nice(-15) is running
...
in the mean time, rebalance_domain event can be triggered on
cpu #0: and due to the huge load on cpu #1, nice (0) is pulled over
(back) to the cpu #0
...
this situation may repeat again and again --> nice(0) tasks are being
pulled back and forth.
Other variants:
- the normal rebalance_domain event can be triggered at (*) and,
provided idle_idx == 0, cpu_load[] is not considered again and one of
the nice(0) can be migrated (a CPU_IDLE case).
the difference is that CPU_NEWLY_IDLE is triggered immediately after a
CPU becomes idle, while it may take some time for a normal rebalance
event (with CPU_IDLE in this case) to be triggered.
- moreover, I observed cpu_load[] from /proc/sched_debug while running
your test application and I did see from time to time cases when
cpu_load[] is low (both cpus are comparable, load-wise) on the cpu
where nice(-15) is normally running (I even used cpu_affinity to get
it bound to it)... the time for which nice(-15) is _not_ running can
be enough to degrade some of the slots of cpu_load[] back to 0...
should the rebalance_domain be triggered at this particular moment and
depending on sd->busy_idx, one of the nice(0) tasks can be migrated.
Note, different versions of kernels may have (and have) different
variants of tunings for domains, plus there can be some differences in
generic behavior of the load balancer.

e.g. by reading its config and kernel version. But as a generic way
(sort of API for user-space), I guess, no.

why are your application depends on the load-balancer's decisions?
Maybe it's just smth wrong with its logic instead? :-/
