Because I did not expect it to happen, I had lots of users screaming at
me to fix it now, when it did happen. The server had been up sense the
night before. It was not until users started showing up in the morning
that the problem manifested itself.
The point is I was hoping to get a list of things to try to capture in
case it happened again, testing is all well and good, but getting
information from a production box can be valuable, as long as it's not
some odd corner case.
Capturing SysRq-T was on my list to do.
I'll investigate stack pointers, and If I can post stack traces.
I was hoping to get pointers like below before I tried it again.
