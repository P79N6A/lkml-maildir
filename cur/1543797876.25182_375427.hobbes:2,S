Hrrm, after doing a bit of reading on cache-coherency, verifying that the
corresponding cache-lines on other CPUs are invalidated can (sometimes)
be done quite quickly, so waiting for that before issuing reads might not
destroy performance. I still doubt that i386es do thing this way, but I
don't think it matters (see below).

What does it mean for a write to start? For that matter, what does it mean
for a write to complete?
I think my focusing on the hardware details (of which I am woefully
ignorant) was a mistake: the hardware can really do whatever it wants so
long as it implements the expected abstract machine model, and it is
ordering that matters in that model. So it makes sense that ordering, not
time, is what the definitions of the memory barriers focus on.
I think that Oleg's question:

is really just about the timeliness with which writes before a smp_mb()
become visible to other CPUs. Does Linux run on architectures in which
writes are not propagated in a timely manner (that is: other CPUs can read
stale values for a "considerable" time)? I rather doubt it.
But with a proviso to my answer: the compiler will happily hoist reads out
of loops. So writes won't necessarily get read in a timely manner.
