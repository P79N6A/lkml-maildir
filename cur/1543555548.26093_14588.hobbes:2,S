  Others have reported similar problems, i.e.
  NOTHING after the "booting kernel message".
  My case is:
  Dual P-II Xeons, Intel 440GX chipset.
  Booting with loadlin or syslinux-1.50
  root-partition: /dev/hdc3
  Kernel freatures:  
    CPU set to Pentium-II
    No module support
    No plug "n" play
    Nothing unusual at all.  (I've tried many variations)
  I've built many kernels in the past and can still boot
  linux-2.4.0-test10.pre??? versions.
  Any advice would be most welcome.
