You keep adopting the interpretation which best suits you, taking
quotes out of context, and keep repeating things that have already
been answered. There are limits to one's patience.
What you did is change your position twice. It's there for anyone to see.

Ah, finally. Here's an actual suggestion. _IF_ you want, I'll just
export a ltt_set_filter(*callback) and rewrite the if in
_ltt_log_event() to:
if ((ltt_filter != NULL) && !(&ltt_filter(event_id, event_struct, data)))
	return -EINVAL;
You're always welcome to do the following from anywhere in your code:
ltt_set_filter(NULL);

What you are suggesting is that a system administator that wants to
monitor his sendmail server over a period of three weeks should
just postprocess 1.8TB (1MB/s) of data because Thomas Gleixner didn't
like the idea of kernel event filtering based on anything but events.
