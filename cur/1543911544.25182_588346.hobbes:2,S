CONFIG_BLOCK disables the block layer.
CONFIG_BLK_DEV disables the block devices.
Is there _ever_ a time you want the block layer but no block devices?
(I ask because this is the first time I've had to add a symbol to my User Mode 
Linux miniconfig since 2.6.12, and I can't figure out what the actual purpose 
of this symbol is.)
