Dear Friends,
              I am trying to port Linux PXA audio
driver to RTLinux. I am using pxa-ac7.c and
pxa-audio.c
 and eliminated sound_core.c, and i will register two
device /dev/mixer and /dev/dsp to RTLinux kernel.
           The real need is, i wants to generate a sin
wave using audio codec. With in 600us DMA controller
should fill the codec FIFO, if that is not met
distortion will happen. I think normal linux
interrupts and Process scheduling may cause some
problems.
In porting it seems difficult to port kernel
scheduling , dynamic memory allocation(for DMA) and
synchronization.
Please help me
Nobin Mathew
