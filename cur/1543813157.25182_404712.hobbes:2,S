You're the guy who's doing all the work...
The linear list walk is a worry.  Every time we have one of those someone
gets bitten by it.
It's rather similar to the vma rbtree.
The radix-tree supports both in-order traversal and O(log(n)) lookup.  For
non-duplicated-key items it _should_ be OK?  (It could be used for
duplicated-key items too, btw).
