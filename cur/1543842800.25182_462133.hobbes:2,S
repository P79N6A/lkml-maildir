Grr.  Here is the other half of my confusion.
The patch:
[PATCH] vt: Rework the console spawning variables.
is fine.
The patch:
[PATCH] vt: Make vt_pid a struct pid (making it pid wrap around safe).
which uses xchg() is racy, and needs to be fixed.
Oleg could you confirm that quick analysis.
Thanks,
Eric
