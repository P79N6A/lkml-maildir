Ok, sorry for the confusion. I try to clear that up:
There is machine1 (the one with ksymoops trace). It mounts 6 ext2
partitions, 4 reiserfs partitions, a number of nfs partitions through
automounter (like maybe 2-10) and 1 nfs partitions to backup to (that
one is regularly mounted and umounted after the backup).
the machine it backs up to say machine2 is running reiserfs only but
also mounts stuff using automounter...
both machines{1,2} are smp, kernel 2.4.20, both are nfs-servers.
I just checked the logs... It seems that the oops occurs 24 seconds
after the backup script was started (which is run hourly). 
This script first mounts the nfs share, then looks for modified files
and tar's them over, then umounts the share.
So it is probably the umount of that nfs partion.
HTH,
Soeren.
