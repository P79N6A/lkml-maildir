Sorry, you must be talking about M$ stuff. I wasn't. There are
real operating systems that work. They solved a lot of problems
by doing things correctly, learning from the mistakes of others.

Also, the M$ __kernel__ doesn't look for any files of any kind except
for its page file which is locates without the file-system, BTW.
If you have the misfortune of using some contraption that uses M$,
just bring up the "Task Manager". Look at the "processes". One
of them there, looks for new disks/mounts/etc at 1-second intervals.
Can you guess which one? Hint. You can't figure it out from its name!

A kernel stack is simply an implimentation detail. Somebody made
an early decision to use non-paged memory for stacks. From that
point one, we have to either live with it or change it. The
change doesn't involve size. It involves kind.
