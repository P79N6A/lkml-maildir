inode numbers have in the past been enough to find the object in the
filesystem, and more than a few applications have counted on this.  In my
mind, the difference between an interesting research project and a real
professional grade product is compatibility with these kinds of traditional
expectations.
I think reiserfs has been lucky that we've managed to work around the inode
number problem so far (with help from Neil, Andi and others), but the
number of hours wasted on cramming the 64bit key into various applications
has been huge.
It only makes a speed difference because the original format relies on it.
When redoing the format for v4, this kind of thing should at least be
considered. </soapbox>
