That could be dealt with by letting people resend feature containing 
patches that were first submitted by Halloween (forward porting them as 
things progress) until they get a rejection or Linus announces he has 
taken all that he wants from the queue.  
A thundering herd of patches is an opportunity, not a problem, unless 
they need to get applied by Halloween.;-)
