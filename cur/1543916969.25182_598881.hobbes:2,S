We've had another late arriving bug fix:
commit ff4abd6cfacf0bb23a077f615d3a5cd17359db1b
Author: David Miller <davem@davemloft.net>
Date:   Fri Aug 24 22:25:58 2007 -0700
    [SCSI] esp: fix instance numbering.
    Because the ->unique_id is set too late, the ESP scsi host
    instance numbers in the kernel log during probing are
    wrong.
    Bug reported by Meelis Roos.
    Signed-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>
    Signed-off-by: James Bottomley <James.Bottomley@SteelEye.com>
Which I've added.  The diffstat is now:
 esp_scsi.c           |    3 ++-
 scsi_transport_spi.c |   28 ++++++++++++++++++++++------
