hm:
[  104.224904] oprofile: using NMI interrupt.
could you disable CONFIG_OPROFILE? Maybe it interferes with the NMI 
watchdog?
how does /proc/interrupts look like shortly after bootup? Does a simple 
"intentional lockup" piece of code, which provokes a hard lockup from 
user-space, get properly zapped by the NMI watchdog (within a minute or 
so):
# cat > lockup.c
int main(void)
{
	iopl(3);
	for (;;)
		asm("cli");
}
Ctrl-D
# make lockup
# ./lockup
<hard hang>
the NMI watchdog should produce a console message similar to:
 BUG: NMI Watchdog detected LOCKUP on CPU0, eip bff12345, registers:
 ...
( if you test ./lockup and get the message properly then i'd suggest a 
  new reboot - i think we inhibit further console output after an NMI 
  printout. )
