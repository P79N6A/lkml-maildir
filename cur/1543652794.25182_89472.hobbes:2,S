Chmod is easier to administor (the special permissions are obvious with 
a standard tool called ls), and doesn't require giving random apps root 
privs (good practice still dictates that database backends should not 
have root).  Capabilities would work, but have yet to catch on in any 
real sense and are lacking in terms of useful tools in most distributions.
