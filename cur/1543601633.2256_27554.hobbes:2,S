Windows XP standard doesn't touch it. This MSI K7T Turbo BIOS Rev 2.9 
(latest) which has a KT133A sets it to 0x8D as default though. No, not 
89. One unexplained reboot on the machine (it's not mine) though. I'll 
try setting the bit to 0 though and see if it remains stable. I'll wait 
for another unexplained reboot first though.
