Since the title of the thread applies...
What command (or whatever) does one use to do things like set the power
controls on a libata-controlled SATA drive?  hdparm doesn't seem to do
anything but complain when I try to use the various features.
hdparm /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 IO_support   =  0 (default 16-bit)
 ...
Does the "16-bit" mean anything or is it just a bogon?
