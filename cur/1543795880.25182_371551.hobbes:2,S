Subject: [PATCH] usb-storage: add debug entry for REPORT LUNS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/29/264

Bugs involving the REPORT LUNS SCSI-3 command are much easier to track down
if usb-storage displays the command's name, rather than "(Unknown command)".
