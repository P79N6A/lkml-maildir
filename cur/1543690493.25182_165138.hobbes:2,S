BIOS is 6/20/2003.
Yes, we did CMOS reset, because the board 'played dead' for a
while.  After staying without battery it woke up again.
HPT acts still same.  I looked BIOS changelog, did not saw
anything related to overclocking.

I saw something like that too - when disk was in second channel,
it did not crash because it did not detect anything.

"FREQ: 82" is pretty high as the limit is 85.
I replaced "< 0x55" with "<= 0x55" in hpt366.c and the driver
did not crash, but it also did not detect cdrom - only thing
behind it ATM - so I did not bother messing with it further.

Now I tried - that one also did not detect cdrom.  I cant
experiment further as the machine needs to go to production
soon.  ATM I disabled onboard HPT, and put in separate IDE
controller (HPT370) to get needed IDE channel.
My conclusions:
1) Motherboard is overclocked by manufacturer - so in the future
   I intend to stay away from EPOX.
2) HPT372n support in Linux is beta (as documented...)
