I understand this; I mentioned earlier that in my case, MySQL isn't even
swapping (300MB physical memory vs. 45MB db). 
Top reports ~10Mb free and 60MB used as buffer.
I don't know linux internals well enough; but what happens when an app is
busy read'ing / seek'ing a file as opposed to reading it mmaped when such
a file is small enough to reside in memory? Does'nt this case make a
difference?
