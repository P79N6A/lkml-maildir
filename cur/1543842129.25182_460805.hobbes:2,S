Presumably it is not continuous but there are checkpoints, and in the
worst case, enforcement of a checkpoint will require an SMI.
But OK, heuristically I'm sure it is much quicker to already have most
memory saved. I guess this is a requirement otherwise they would have
done it the obvious way... but my question is just about what exact
requirement does this satisfy that a stop_machine would not.

Yep, I'm not saying it couldn't be useful.
