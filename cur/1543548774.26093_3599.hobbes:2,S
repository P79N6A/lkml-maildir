Something I've been planning on implementing for some time now is a
small patch to patch, so that it recognises lines of the form:
Notify: email,id
in a patch, then an email is sent to <email> stating that a patch with
ID <id> has been applied. This would allow for automatic notification
of the patch author when their patch has been applied. All that is
needed is for Linus to update his patch binary.
This way, I wouldn't have to sift through a diff to see if my patch
has been applied. And it doesn't require any change in the way Linus
works. An extension which does change the way he works would involve
him running a patch --reject on a patch before hitting 'd'.
And possibly also a patch --not-now.
It also doesn't require developers to change their habits. It's
entirely optional.
Separately, making Linus' unpacked working trees available:
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v*/LIVE/
would make patch generation a lot easier.
