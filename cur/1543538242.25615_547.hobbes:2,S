Of course. malloc() is not part of Linux. It usually just sets the
break address. This is what it's supposed to do. Allocations occur
on a page-by-page basis when there kernel page-faults. This is how
virtual memory works.
If your programs insist on allocating all the memory in the world, they
will fail. If you have 'N' programs that allocate 'X' bytes of data,
you need N*X + overhead of swap space, to handle the allocations.
