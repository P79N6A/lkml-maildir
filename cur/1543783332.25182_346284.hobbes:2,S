I don't know of anyone who's writen a "2D-centric" Mesa driver, but 
it's feasible.  The basic idea would be to simply fast-path a handful 
of basic OpenGL paths that correspond to the basic X operations:
1. Solid rect fill: glScissor + glClear
2. Blit/copy: glCopyPixels
3. Monochrome glyphs: glBitmap
4. PutImage: glDrawPixels
Those OpenGL commands could be directly implemented with whatever 
mechanism is used in conventional X drivers.  I don't think the 
overhead of going through the OpenGL/Mesa API would be significant.
If Xgl used those commands and you didn't turn on fancy blending, etc. 
the performance should be fine.  If the hardware supported blending, 
that could be easily exposed too.  The rest of OpenGL would go through 
the usual software paths (slow, but better than nothing).
It might be an interesting project for someone.  After one driver was 
done subsequent ones should be fairly easy.

Yeah, we really need to make some progress with off-screen rendering 
in our drivers (either Pbuffers or renderbuffers).  I've been working 
on renderbuffers but we really need that overdue memory manager.

If the blending is for screen-aligned rects, glDrawPixels would be a 
far easier path to optimize than texturing.  The number of state 
combinations related to texturing is pretty overwhelming.
Anyway, I think we're all in agreement about the desirability of 
having a single, unified driver in the future.
