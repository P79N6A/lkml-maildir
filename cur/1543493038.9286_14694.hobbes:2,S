	i am truly sorry. i can't give you any information right now.
is there any document describing the architecture of the UFS. right now
i am trying to figure out the architecture by reading code. needless to
say, progress is painfully slow. i am stuck at the "cylinders" handling
section of the code. *ANYBODY* who has information about ufs architecture 
*please* contact me with the same. i will be eternally grateful.
						thanks, murali
