My original post I was following gave my config, built-in graphics using 
945G framebuffer. This is a server, I'm not a gamer. The only fancy 
graphics I have are on a system with no on board video at all, I picked 
up a moderately high-end Radeon card to drop in. And to give you an idea 
of what a gamer I am, that uses the vesafb driver ;-)
