I believe the code is attempting to make sure the device is properly powered
on in the first place. CONFIG_PM only governs later power management.

Please don't. A system with this Promise 20269 card in it hangs without this
patch, I can see the splat happen with a PCI analyser.
The function being altered is almost certainly _wrong_ for non-PM-version-2
cards, but I don't have an old enough PCI spec to check.
A better solution would be to drop the level of the printk() to KERN_DEBUG or
to delete it entirely, assuming the patch otherwise works for Mark.
