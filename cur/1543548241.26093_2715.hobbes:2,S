   If you just unset it in .config and echo 0 >
   /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn, it just acts as if it was enabled.
If you unset it in .config there is no possibility for
ECN _anything_ to occur from our networking code, period.
In this case, changing the tcp_ecn sysctl is a nop, it cannot change
the behavior of anything whatsoever.  Some monster with a funny sense
of humor has crawled inside of your computer if changing the tcp_ecn
sysctl does anything when CONFIG_INET_ECN is not set.
