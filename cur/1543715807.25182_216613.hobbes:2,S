My shuttle is a FN41 board in a SN41G2 system.
I found "rev 1.0" BIOS (FN41S00X of 12/18/2002) on Shuttle's ftp site
and downgraded to that, but still no hang.
It may be this board never hangs no matter what,
or perhaps C1 disconnect was simply disabled in that BIOS
b/c there was no option for it in Advanced Chipset Features
like there is for the most recent BIOS.
Other things about my board.
I run "optimized defaults", I don't overclock anything.
Processor is an AMD XP 2200+
Does anybody else see the hang with this processor model?
I wonder if the hang is processor model or speed dependent?

Unfortunately I don't have tools for debugging nvidia + amd hardware.
I would expect that those companies do, however.  So encouraging them
to reproduce the hang internally may be the best way to go.

I got tangled in this b/c this board (actually, the reference BIOS for
this chipset) had some unusual ACPI related failures.  If the failures
turn out to be related to ACPI, I'll do what I can to help.  But I
expect that hardware debugging tools may be necessary before the
hang issue is completely explained and solved.
