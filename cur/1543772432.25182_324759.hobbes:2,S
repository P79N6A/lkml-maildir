Much to our dislike, we only noticed that we forgot to disable the debug
options after posting the results :/ So, in all fairness, we will be
redoing the tests on PREEMPT_RT early next week. In the plethora of things
we wanted to try, it also seems that the "dd" test wasn't exactly as it
was supposed to be. There should've been a "bs=1M" in there; as it
currently is, the dd command doesn't really put any real load. We'll add
this one to our repeats.
I notice there are already suggestions regarding additional types of
tests, and that's good. We'll try to take as many of these as possible.
This is relatively simple given the scripts Kristian has put together.
Nevertheless, it must be understood that we don't have infinite resources.
So in sharing the framework we've developed, we hope others will be
motivated to conduct their own tests.
