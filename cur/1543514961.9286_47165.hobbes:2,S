hi i have just got 2.3.25
when i compiled it i got some errors in bootsect.S
    make[1]: Entering directory
`/usr/srclocal/linux-2.3.25/arch/i386/boot'
    as --defsym bootsect_kludge=0x220 -o bbootsect.o bbootsect.s

i fixed most of them myself then i got this
    as --defsym bootsect_kludge=0x220 -o bbootsect.o bbootsect.s
    bbootsect.s: Assembler messages:
    bbootsect.s:527: Error: operands given don't match any known 386

and now one to go
bootsect.S line 101
    # Segments are as follows: ds = es = ss = cs - INITSEG, fs = 0,
    # and gs is unused.
     movw %cx, %fs                 # set fs to 0
     movw $0x78, %bx            # fs:bx is parameter table address
     pushw %ds
-   ldsw %fs:(%bx), %si      # ds:si is source
+   ldsw %fs:(%ebx), %si    # ds:si is source
     movb $6, %cl                     # copy 12 bytes
     cld
     pushw %di                           # di = 0x4000-12.
can some one help this is as far as i got
is the ldsw   =    lds      load pointer to ds    ?
ps i use as 2.9.1
also why can we not use NASM or the like then we would get nice looking
asm code ?
