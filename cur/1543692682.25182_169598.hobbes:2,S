Subject: [BUG?] modprobe sch_htb fails

Today i recompiled my kernel (version 2.4.22) to make my first steps 
towards traffic shaping.
I found out, that the module sch_htb cannot be loaded.
I can't tell why. Every option under "Networking Options"->"QoS and/or 
fairqueuing" was either marked to be compiled statically or as a module 
if possible.
I guess it's only a "bug" in the dependencies or something similar.
If you need anything to reproduce the "bug", i can send you my .config 
or anything you need.
"modprobe sch_htb" failed with:
