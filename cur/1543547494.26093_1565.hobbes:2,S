Hi guys,
Maybe its me, but I don't think so. :)
Anyway, linux-2.4.0-test7 wont boot on a Cyrix computer.
test6 has no problems whatsoever and 7 stops right after
'Uncompressing kernel...'
Tried make mrproper, tried fresh tree from kernel.org.
Still no go.
Kernel as always compiled for 586.
Sounds familiar? Any solutions/tips?
    Met vriendelijke groet,
        Pauline Middelink
