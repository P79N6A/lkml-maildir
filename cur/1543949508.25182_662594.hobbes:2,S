Ahh, yeah, my bad. The origin/HEAD thing will be created if you use either 
clone or "git remote add -m master" to create the remote. But when I asked 
you to do it by just editing the config file, you now have to create that 
HEAD pointer manually too.
You can do
	git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/master
to create the thing (it just creates a symbolic ref from the origin/HEAD 
remote ref to the origin/master one, so now git will know that when you 
talk about 'origin', it is supposed to just use the master branch of 
that remote).

Well, origin/master should have worked, but the fact that plain "origin" 
didn't work is due to exactly the lack of HEAD file for that remote branch 
(for your kernel tree, there's only one remote branch, so it may be 
"obvious" that origin must be talking about the master branch, but if 
there are multiple branches at the origin it's not obvious *which* branch 
should be considered the default one, which is why we use HEAD)

Well, if "origin/master" works in that situation, then "origin/master" 
should have worked in "git log" too, so maybe you mistyped?
Anyway, with the HEAD link added for the remote 'origin', you should be 
able to use plain 'origin' like you're used to.
