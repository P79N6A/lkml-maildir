This patch-set factors out the thermal throttle processing code
from i386 and x86_64 into a separate file (therm_throt.c).
This allows consistent reporting of CPU thermal throttle events.
Furthermore, a counter is added to /sys that keeps track of the
number of thermal events, such that the user knows how bad the
thermal problem might be (since the logging to syslog and mcelog
is rate limited).
