Linus,
Andrew,
at
http://www.winischhofer.net/sis/sisfb_patch_2.6.10rc2.diff.gz
there is an update for sisfb, lifting it up to version 1.7.17.
It contains all changes done behind my back by other people (viro,
torvalds, adaplas) in the meantime. Furthermore,
- all remaining sparse warnings were fixed (mainly caused by the ROM code)
- problems with very old and brand new BIOSes from SiS were fixed,
- LCD setup was simplified, allowing more display modes than before,
- UMC/charter bridge type handling was added,
- a code clean-up was performed, the new FB_BLANK-flags were taken over,
VBLANK status info was corrected, etc.
Patch is against 2.6.10rc2 vanilla.

Thomas
