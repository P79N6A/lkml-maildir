	It's going to be difficult one, because, there are no hw. acc. drivers for 
nVidia built in X, and there is no R300 accel. Don't know about nv, but for 
Radeon chips only R300 can engage 8x transfer, so until ATI releases docs, or 
some genius figures how R300 work in 3D, IMHO there is no point of hacking X.
