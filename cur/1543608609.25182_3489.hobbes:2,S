I've done quite a bit more kernel profiling and I've found that overhead for 
converting numbers to ascii for transport to proc is significant, and there 
are other overheads as well, such as the sprintf and proc file open.  These 
must be matched by corresponding overhead on the user space side, which I 
have not profiled.  I'll take some time and present these numbers properly at 
some point.
Not that I think we are going to change this way of doing things any time
soon - Linus has spoken - but at least we should know what the overheads are.
Programmers should not labor under the misaprehension that this is an 
efficient interface.
