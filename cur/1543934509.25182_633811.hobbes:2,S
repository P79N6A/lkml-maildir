Since they're frozen in reverse order, the dependant one would be frozen
first.

Removing my ugly debugging statements, it's currently:
/**
 * freeze_filesystems - lock all filesystems and force them into a
consistent
 * state
 */
void freeze_filesystems(int which)
{
        struct super_block *sb;
        lockdep_off();
        /*
         * Freeze in reverse order so filesystems dependant upon others are
         * frozen in the right order (eg. loopback on ext3).
         */
        list_for_each_entry_reverse(sb, &super_blocks, s_list) {
                if (sb->s_type->fs_flags & FS_IS_FUSE &&
                    sb->s_frozen == SB_UNFROZEN &&
                    which & FS_FREEZER_FUSE) {
                        sb->s_frozen = SB_FREEZE_TRANS;
                        sb->s_flags |= MS_FROZEN;
                        continue;
                }
                if (!sb->s_root || !sb->s_bdev ||
                    (sb->s_frozen == SB_FREEZE_TRANS) ||
                    (sb->s_flags & MS_RDONLY) ||
                    (sb->s_flags & MS_FROZEN) ||
                    !(which & FS_FREEZER_NORMAL))
                        continue;
                freeze_bdev(sb->s_bdev);
                sb->s_flags |= MS_FROZEN;
        }
        lockdep_on();
}
