Yes, GPL'd of course.  But these pll definitions are not strictly tied 
to nxt200x -- they may very well be used by another frontend module in 
the future.
Actually, we keep pll info in a separate file (dvb-pll.c) so that the 
tuner programming can be used by any frontend module, depending on the 
design..... About EXPORT_SYMBOL, this is how it's done all over dvb-pll.c
If this needs to change, then it should apply to the entire dvb-pll.
I'll wait for Johannes' comments on this.
