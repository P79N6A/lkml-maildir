Hi,
After a while of using my machine i've noticed init seams to be using
99% of one of my cpu's. This seamed odd to me so after checking the
getty wasn't respawning, and as best as i could other applications i
though i would post this message to ask what should i do next. I
currently haven't reset the machine, it seams to work fine, though
killing application causes them to go into z state.
Linux version 2.2.12 (root@mytoy) (gcc version 2.95.2 19990906
(prerelease)) #1 SMP Wed Sep 15 13:36:28 BST 1999
Any advice on what to do next? I will provide any other information if
necessary.
But advice on what to check next would be useful
Please could you CC any replays to me as i'm not subscribed to linux
kernel
paul
