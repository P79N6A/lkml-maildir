I agree with both of you that the #ifdefs in struct kimage should be
avoided, but I wonder if adding variables in a structure on the
control page is the easiest and cleanest way.
I think that defining a structure for each architecture in
include/asm/kexec.h that is included in struct kimage is the best way
to go. Then each architecture can have whatever data it wants there,
and we both avoid #ifdefs in struct kimage _and_ we stay away from
overly complicated code that just allocates, frees and parses
architecture-dependent data.
Thanks for the input,
