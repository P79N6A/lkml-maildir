Yes, I've always felt that at least one new list is needed to do the job 
properly, and there are other considerations as well.  What we really want to 
do is treat a short burst of accesses to a page as a single access.  Right 
now we're only doing a very crude approximation of that, which happens to 
work for some common situations, of which updatedb is not one.
Obviously we don't want to be adding new lists and other experimental cruft 
just now.
