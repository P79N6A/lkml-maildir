  Ah, ok. My guess is that the buffer is in BJ_Locked list. But we don't
write buffers from BJ_Locked list (as they are supposedly already
written). What probably happens is:
  Process 1				Process 2
  We start scanning t_sync_datalist.
  Add buffer to wbuf[].
					Locks the buffer (it can be some other
					writer).
  Restarts scanning the list
  Finds buffer is locked -> moves to
   BJ_Locked list (actually this is BUG
   as we have not written the buffer yet)
                                        journal_unmap_buffer() happens
  Maybe what you could verify is, that we are moving the buffer added to
wbuf[] to BJ_Locked list in the write_out_data: loop.
  If it really happens, what I've described above, the fix should be
different. We shouldn't have moved the buffer to BJ_Locked list...
