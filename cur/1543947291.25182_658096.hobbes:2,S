The problem with the whitelists is that they have to use quite a lot of data to
reliably match the system.  The s2ram whitelist is not 100% reliable, because
it uses too little information to distinguish different versions of the same
machine model, for example.
Plus, in an ideal world, we should be able to match all possible working
graphics/chipset/BIOS combinations and that would be quite a bit of a database.
Also, there are some quirks that need to be run from the user land, AFAICS
(eg. in an i86 real-mode compatible manner).
IMO, whitelisting is not a solution.  It's only a sort-of-working workaround
and as such it shouldn't be put into the kernel.
Thanks,
