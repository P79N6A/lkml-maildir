  Slackware 7.x lacks /dev/ppp which is needed to do ppp with 2.4.x kernel
, I had the same problem when I moved my slack 7.0 box to 2.4 You also
need newer pppd . The steps you have to take  are in
/your-linux-source-dir/Documentation/Changes . There is a ppp section in
there . Read it and follow its instructions .
  Kind regards ,
