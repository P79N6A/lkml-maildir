Infact I didn't wanted having to alloc more memory in order to free memory
(it's something I like to avoid). But the point is that I think that
swapping out from shrink_mmap() even if doing ordered I/O is not a win.
Try, benchmark and let me know your results, maybe I am wrong.  And with a
FIFO also shrink_mmap() would change in order to do what swap_out() is
doing right now. And btw I think that the fifo could be approssimated to a
browse in the swap cache.

Agreed. I just pointed this out, but maybe I did not understood _where_ we
should do the write to disk to reclaim memory.
