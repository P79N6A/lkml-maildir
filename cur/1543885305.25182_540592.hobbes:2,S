I have used SD for the first time with this patchset, and I have to say, my experience
has been very positive over the past four days.  My desktop has been extraordinarily
smooth during interactive tasks with no audio drop-outs. Best of all, the desktop has
been completely responsive despite CPU hogging tasks.  I do not need to nice X either.
This looks like a perfect scheduler.
Swap prefetch continues to work its miracles as I've been doing a lot of work lately with
a 33"x44" poster that contains many high-resolutions images, while using gimp at the same time!
Thanks so much for all your incredible work!
