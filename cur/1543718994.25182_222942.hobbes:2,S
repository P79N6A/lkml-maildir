His patch will still work e.g. if the interrupt locks are messed up.
Then the keyboard interrupt will not work anymore, but NMI will.
Arguably a bit obscure, but could happen.
The bigger advantage I see from the patch (and why i like it) is 
that distributions often disable sysrq by default for security
reasons. This is not really needed for this NMI oopser, since you
can assume that someone with access to the NMI switch can crash the
machine at will.
