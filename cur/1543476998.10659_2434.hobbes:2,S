You may not realize that this is already true in C.  In C the kernel
says e.g. 'return -ENOENT'.  That's not 'handling' the error at all!
It's just *reporting* the error.
Replace the 'return' with a 'throw' in C++, and nothing's different,
except that it's effectively a multi-stack-frame return that's used
to _report_ errors.

Use of exceptions makes error-handling logic less localized.  But to
the extent that the overall code is less cluttered as a result, the
results can end up *more* readable.
Besides, I believe in optimizing for maintainability, and easy
browsing is only one factor in ease of maintenance.  Far more
important, IMO, is the ability to specify design decisions exactly
once; careful use of exceptions can assist toward that goal.

The word 'bloat' is unnecessarily pejorative; it's not bloat if it's
actually useful.

Exceptions don't clean carpets or make coffee, either, but that
doesn't make them useless.

Which shows just how useful they would be!  This is a point in favor
of exceptions, not against them.

"It's a fair cop, but society's to blame."
The STL is single-mindedly general and orthogonal, which I find
refreshing.  Its design goals lead to tradeoffs in ease-of-typing and
clarity-of-errors, which I can live with.

You'd just have to borrow some of the EGCS library and put it into the
Linux 'lib' directory, so it's always available.  No biggie.

Readability, I'll grant you...  :-/  But the STL *is* simple (in its
thorough implementation of simple concepts), clean (in orthogonality),
safe (in static type checking), and maintainable (by its helping you
to localize your design decisions).
Learn to appreciate the STL's strong points, and it'll help you.
