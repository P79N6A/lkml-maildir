We're talking about two types of compatibility.  The first (which
everyone agrees on) is that /dev names don't change between 2.4 and
2.5.  The second is direct numerical compatibility so that a /dev still
using the old 8:8 scheme works.
What you're asking for is more a wish list of enhancements:

By and large, this is true.  There will be problems where probe order
has altered because of changes to bus enumeration schemes or for other
reasons.

They'll all see /dev/sd<A>[n] as in 2.4

True until a reboot, as in 2.4

That's not a 2.4 guarantee, it won't be a 2.5 one.

That has never been true in Linux, and not in most commerical unixes,
either.  Cluster tools are used to do this mapping and most commercially
available linux cluster tools solve this problem, so there's no need for
the kernel to do it.
A lot of these enhancements will be covered (or at least a solution will
be facilitated) by udev.  See

(unfortunately, the announcement thread has grown rather big).
