As I didn't get any ideas on what to do to help find the problem with the
dl2k driver, I'm doing some tests to get to know what has broken it.
I have today compiled dl2k from git, the version with the 2007-12-23 patches
from Al Viro: dl2k endianness fixes (.24 fodder?) Right before the Al Viro
patches. This seems to be working perfectly on my system.
I'm wondering if I can apply the patches by Al Viro one by one to know which
one broke it.
Regards...
