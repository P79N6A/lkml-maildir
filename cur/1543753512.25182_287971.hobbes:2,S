(o) Vote for this.
IMO, a make install should NEVER run the compiler.
The reason is: I'm deliberaely compiling as a user on the fastest system
before I copy or mount the FS to/on some other box and do a make install.
The other box will be _very_ slow while compiling or missing some of the
needed components (e.g. gcc).
