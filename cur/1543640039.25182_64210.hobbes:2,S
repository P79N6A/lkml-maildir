These patches allowed you to collect I/O information on a per-partition
basis, as well as removing the restriction about only monitoring the
first sixteen disks.  Is anybody working on porting this to 2.5?  If not,
I'll do it.
These 2.4.19 patches did not, it appear, provide any means (through
/proc, for example, as in the original patches) of retrieving the
information even though code was added to collect it.  Any reason why not?
