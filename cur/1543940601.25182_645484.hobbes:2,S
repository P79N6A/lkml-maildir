A proprietary network filesystem driver _on a different system_, you
mean? In this case the proprietary code has no direct access to your
kernel data, except through the communication protocol. No tainting is
involved, as all corruption in your kernel is caused by kernel bugs in
visible code that can be debugged.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
