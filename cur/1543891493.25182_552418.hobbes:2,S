But that's just wrong. First off, all distro kernels come with ACPI on, so 
the thing you're fixing is really just for somebody who compiles his own 
kernel in a particular (and unusual/strange) configuration, and you're 
making it _worse_ for everybody else.
And you're blacklisting it without even understaning _what_ is wrong. I 
really think we should figure that part out first,
