Here are some patches to the ide-floppy driver to support formatting
of standard floppies and a (very slightly) modified copy of fdformat.
The patch also includes a small fix from Gadi to avoid an oops in
idefloppy_end_request when using DMA.
Some points
   - The format unit ioctl isn't much use at the moment as it locks
     my machine (presumably) because no ide commands can be issued
     until it is complete - I couldn't get the status reporting during
     format to work. Format track also suffers from this but isn't
     _quite_ as antisocial.
   - (For my LS120 at least) the drives don't appear to want to do
     a low level format of an LS120 - they just ignore the command
     (LS120 disks are pre-formatted anyway)
   - No alternative format densities are supported. My drive reported
     a couple of alternatives but they were all lower than 1.44M so
     there didn't seem to be much point.
