It looks OK to me.  It doesn't quite do everything you want in terms of doing 
your bus1/id2/lun0 piece, but it's a good start.
We should probably have some more discussion about the layout of the device 
tree, particularly if it's going to be consistent with other devices like ide 
discs and cds.
I'd like to see the "name" field become mutable from user level somehow just 
so we can fix the enterprise name on broken devices without having to have a 
huge kernel exception table, but that's my only current concern.
