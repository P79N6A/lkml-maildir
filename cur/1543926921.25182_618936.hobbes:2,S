Trond,
The problem is in nfs_mountpoint_timeout. After this time 
dentry_delete(/,4) removes the mountpoint, then it is very difficult to 
automount (at least with CFSD), one has got to try 2 or three times 
cd'ing into the mount point. Applications wont ever had the chance to 
autoremount (ENOTDIR).
I have some questions:
- nfs_mountpoint_timeout seems to be set in sysctl.c even if nfsv4 is 
not. Is this correct ? I've read somewhere that it was introduced for v4.
- Why this sysctl is not registered in my 2.6.20 kernel where it should 
be registered ?
- Why this parameter has not a 'disabled' value (i mean kind of -1) ?
Thanks,
Gianluca
