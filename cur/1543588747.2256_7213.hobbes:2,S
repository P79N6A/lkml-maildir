Matt mentioned the following:
| struct instruction_t {
| 	__s16 code;
| 	__s16 rxlen;
| 	__s16 *rxbuf;
| 	__s16 txlen;
| 	__s16 *txbuf;
| };
So far, I now know I can grab stuff across the user <-> kernel divide as I
planned. The only problem I'm left with, which was kindly pointed out to
me, is a question of packing with respect to both kernel & user-space.
Can anyone suggest a method of either assuring the above structure is
always packed the same, or alterations so that the problem is
minimised? Either splitting the one ioctl into many, etc.
Thanks
Matt
