I have never written any kernel code that added usages of the BKL.  The
fact that I am now maintaining code that uses it should not be confused
with this.  Yes, some of my filesystems (pcihpfs and usbfs) now use it,
but that was due to other people pushing it down, out of the VFS.

Yes, and there can be unintended conequences for just blindly removing
the BKL as your input layer patch proved.  The input layer was using the
BKL in a reliable manner, it just wasn't documented.  And by using the
BKL in my code, it does not decrease reliability in any way (just might
slow it down under some system loads, but it still works properly.)

Ah, so it's easier to try to pick on subsystems that don't matter like
USB and driverfs?  :)

Either way, you get my same response, "Why?"  Again, as someone stated,
where in the USB code is the BKL used that affects performance in any
real life situations?
And yes, sending crappy patches does get people jumping, but don't rely
on that being a good method of doing development.  People only fall for
that one so many times.
