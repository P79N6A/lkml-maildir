That is rather confusing with respect to 1394. You should log out of sbp2
devices, but they can still be shared. Basically 1394 is shared though, and
other types of device dont have logins. So you should probably exclude it.
But anything with disks on at least wants the device flushed before sleeping,
and probably unmounted in many cases.
