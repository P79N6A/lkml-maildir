What happens, is that the file is *NEVER* seen, which is clearly a bug.
Don't argue on that, please. (Here: 2.2.10ac8 w/ knfsd-1.4.2).
How about _not_ resetting the timeout on a new lookup which is not performed
actually?
This would not flood the network with unecessary NFS_LOOKUP calls, but with
one every second, regardless whether in the meantime sb. made a cached neg.
dentry lookup or not.
Patch appended.
