Hi,
I use 2.6.9-ac3 on my Laptop and I just wanted to burn a DVD-Video with
my external Pioneer DVD writer which is connected via fire-wire to the
Laptop.
Before 2.6.9-ac3 I used 2.6.9-rc2-mm2 and with this I could write CDs/DVDs.
<rant>
So why is it still impossible that users can write CDs/DVDs. I, as a
user, find this rather ridicolous that you have to patch the kernel to
get this simple thing running. Security is important, yes, but this is
just annoying.
I really hope that gets fixed soon, because its just annoying to reboot
to a different kernel, just to write CDs ...
</rant>
lg, clemens
