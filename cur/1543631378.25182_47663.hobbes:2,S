Here comes for all sparc people who can't install BK:
All sparc32/sparc64 related changes since 2.4.19-pre8 in one diff
copied and fixed up by hand from
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.4/ChangeSet@-3w?nav=index.html
All I can claim as to the patched kernel's functionality --
it has compiled for me on sparc32. I'm going to try to boot
it next week when I'm changing disks in my server.
