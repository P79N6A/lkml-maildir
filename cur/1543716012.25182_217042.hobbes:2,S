I don't know. What if you have some huge application that only
runs once per day for 10 minutes? Do you want it to be consuming
100MB of your memory for the other 23 hours and 50 minutes for
no good reason?
Anyway, I have a small set of VM patches which attempt to improve
this sort of behaviour if anyone is brave enough to try them.
Against -mm kernels only I'm afraid (the objrmap work causes some
porting difficulty).
