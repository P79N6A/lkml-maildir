The problem with that approach is that the "s" versions must also take
care of byte swapping (or rather _not_ byteswapping while the non-"s"
do the byteswapping).
So we would need to have raw_{in,out}{b,w,l}. Currently, it's not
possible to implement {in,out}s{b,w,l} in an efficient way because of
that.
Then we would also need to expose the io_barrier for CPUs like PPC
etc...
I tend to think that makes us expose too much CPU-specific things, which
is why I'd rather have the {read,write}s{b,w,l} versions provided by the
arch so those can be done "the right way" in the arch code, and drivers
not care about some of the gory details.
Ben.
