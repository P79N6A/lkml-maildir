gcc is a *LOT* smarter than you give it credit for. It will not warn for
cases where it isn't able to tell how foo is used passed with &foo. It
will warn for cases where it can
Compile the following program with and without -O2 and you'll see just
how smart gcc actually is
#include <stdio.h>
static void bar(char *x) {
  *x = 1;
}
static void baz(char *x) {
  printf("Wombat\n");
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  char x,y;
  bar(&x);
  baz(&y);
  printf("%c,%c\n", x, y);
}
So I'd go look deeper for real bugs
