    Yes, RAID should have a journal or other ordering enforcement, but

    on a single disk you don't have any guarantees of data ordering,

    sectors will make it to disk and some will not => fsck, with
    possible data corrpution or loss.
How so? On a single disk you can either disable write-caching or for
SCSI disks you can use barriers of sorts.
At which time, you can either assume a sector is written or not.
