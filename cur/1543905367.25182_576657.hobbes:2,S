I grepped for couple of items. Heartbeat functionality of for stopping
responding to service processsor in case of panic so that service processor
knows that system has crashed and it needs to reboot the machine. But if
somebody has configured and enabled kdump then we don't want service 
processor to stop responding to heartbeat otherwise service processor
will reboot the machine and we will not be able to capture the dump.
In case of detecting softlockup, panic notifier is used so that in case
of panic we don't want to flag other threads are not being scheduled and
it is a softlockup. In case of kdump this condition is not valid. Immediately
after kdump we will boot to next OS and previous kernel's context is wiped
off.
Can you please be specific what exactly is the problem you are facing? In
what situation is this call creating the problem?

This one is better than registering kdump as one of the users of a
panic_notifier() list. 
I think if there are any crash specific actions, they should be taken care
in next kernel while it is booting.
If something is really very time critical, and has to be done immediately
after panic (I am not sure how can one ensure that given the fact any number
of users can register on panic_notifier_list and you are not sure about your
order in the list and when one will get the control), then probably that
piece of code should be in kernel and called before crash_kexec().
What is that specific piece of action which you can't do in second kernel?
Eric, do you have any thoughts on this. I think these guys are referring
to failover problem where immediately after panic() they want to send
message to other node.
Thanks
Vivek
