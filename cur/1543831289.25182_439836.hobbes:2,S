Just for kicks, after testing those two trees (see previous email) I took my 
2.6.17-mm5 without git-scsi-misc and then patched git-scsi-misc.patch back in, 
rebuilt and rebooted and noted that RAID broke again.  Reverted the patch and it 
all worked.
So I can conclude that definitely and reproduceably that's the one.........
