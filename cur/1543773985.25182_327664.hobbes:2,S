Do you have any specific references?  I've browsed through the VIA specs
here: 
http://gkernel.sourceforge.net/specs/via/,
 but I haven't seen any
mention of VBUS or any notes about programming PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE.
Or do you have any contacts at VIA?  This is going to take a long time
to untangle by trial and error.
