Subject: ide-tape bug in 2.4.0-test8

Summary: ide-tape in 2.4.0-test8 seems to be unable to read the
last block of data in a stream, if the written data wasn't an
exact multiple of the tape unit's block size. 2.2.17 doesn't have
this problem.
Boot kernel 2.4.0-test8.
[root /tmp]# insmod ide-tape
[root /tmp]# dmesg | tail -2
ide-tape: hdd <-> ht0: Seagate STT8000A rev 5.51
ide-tape: hdd <-> ht0: 600KBps, 14*26kB buffer, 5850kB pipeline, 80ms tDSC, DMA
A Seagate TR-4 ATAPI "Hornet" drive. Apparently, the block size is 26k.
[root /tmp]# mt -f /dev/ht0 erase
[root /tmp]# dd if=/tmp/test.dat of=/dev/ht0 bs=1k
39+0 records in
39+0 records out
test.dat is 39k, so this seems ok.
[root /tmp]# dd if=/dev/ht0 of=/tmp/test.out bs=1k
26+0 records in
26+0 records out
ide-tape didn't read the last 13k. Very bad.
Reboot kernel 2.2.17. Same tape.
[root /tmp]# insmod ide-tape
[root /tmp]# dmesg | tail -1
ide-tape: hdd <-> ht0, 600KBps, 14*26kB buffer, 2600kB pipeline, 310ms tDSC, DMA
[root /tmp]# dd if=/dev/ht0 of=/tmp/test.out bs=1k
52+0 records in
52+0 records out
Got more than 39k -- padding, I guess.
[root /tmp]# dd if=/dev/ht0 of=/tmp/test.out bs=1k count=39
39+0 records in
39+0 records out
[root /tmp]# cmp /tmp/test.dat /tmp/test.out
Hmm. 2.4.0-test8 wrote the data ok, but cannot read it. 2.2.17 can.
[root /tmp]# mt -f /dev/ht0 erase
[root /tmp]# dd if=/tmp/test.dat of=/dev/ht0 bs=1k
39+0 records in
39+0 records out
[root /tmp]# dd if=/dev/ht0 of=/tmp/test.out bs=1k count=39
39+0 records in
39+0 records out
[root /tmp]# cmp /tmp/test.dat /tmp/test.out
2.2.17 writes and reads correctly. Good.
I haven't been bitten by this myself (for performance, I always set
the appropriate block size in my backup tools), but the behaviour
in 2.4 is clearly erroneous.
On August 8, Peter Baylies reported in lkml:

I almost ignored this report since I couldn't reproduce it in 2.2.17.
However, 2.4.0-test appears identical to what he described (down to
the kernel log messages), so perhaps he got his kernels mixed up.
