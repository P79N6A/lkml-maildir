The time at which I do the by-hand rebasing the most are the weeks
leading up to a major release.  The reason is to integrate bug fixes
that I know conflict with the 80-odd patches I have queued up for the
next development phase, or that I simply want integrated so that no
_future_ development patches create conflicts.
I think merges with conflicts that need to get resolved by hand create
a lot of noise and useless information and therefore to me they are
pointless.  But this is just my opinion.  It simply works easier to me
to shuffle the patches in by hand and deal with the rejects one by
one.  It's very much akin to how Andrew's -mm tree works.
I think a clean history is worth an extra few minutes of someone's
time.  And note that subsystem development is largely linear anyways.
