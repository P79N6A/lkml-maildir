Hi!
My problem with my HD was something similar. When I bought my new computer
I change the speed of my Pentium II 350 to 396(+-) and the UDMA did not
work properly, and the Hard Disk gave CRC errors. I cannot understand why
the hard disk have problems when I change the speed of the processor. Is
the procesor the checker of CRC of the disk? When I disable the DMA with
hdparm the error disappear.
Thanks.
