I hope that we will not need that many tunables eventually. But my
theory has been that with widespread use and experiments with
the tunables in the event of OOM and latency problems will allow
us to figure out what kind of automatic tuning really works.
Regardless, I think there should be documentation. I will send
a documentation patch.
