Since the hardware request API is (and must be) completely decoupled 
from struct request API, I can achieve 1.5 x non-errata case.

[editor's note:  I wonder if I've broken a grammar rule using so many 
"non"s in a single email]
If I completely ignore partial completions on the normal [non-error] 
paths, the current errata and non-errata struct request completion paths 
would be exactly the same.  Only the error path would differ.  The 
lowest [hardware req API] layer's request granularity is a single 
taskfile, so it will never know about partial completions.

Agreed.  Just in case I transposed a word or something, I wish to 
clarify:  both errata and error paths are almost always partial completions.
However... for the case where both errata taskfiles completely 
_successfully_, it is better have only 1 completion on the hot path (the 
"1.5 x" mentioned above).  Particularly considering that errata 
taskfiles are contiguous, and the second taskfile will completely fairly 
quickly after the first...
The slow, error path is a whole different matter.  Ignoring partial 
completions in the normal path keeps the error path simple, for errata 
and non-errata cases.  Handling partial completions in the error code, 
for both errata and non-errata cases, is definitely something I want to 
do in the future.

As a tangent, I'm hoping to convince some drive manufacturers (under NDA 
most likely, unfortunately) to provide special drive firmwares that will 
simulate read and write errors.  i.e. fault injection.
