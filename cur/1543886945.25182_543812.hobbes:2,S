Well, it was initially SOMEONE_REVIEWIED_THIS flag (and thus pretty
neccessary for initial merge). Now it still serves as
SOMEONE_REVIEWIED_THIS flag, but I guess you could call it
IM_NOT_AN_IDIOT flag, too.
Well, we can go the other way around, but that means more careful
reviewing of incoming code. Yes, we can do it.
