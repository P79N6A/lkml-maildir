libata should also handle this case better. Usually we just need to
defer command handling if the dma_map_sg() fails. Changing
ata_qc_issue() to return nsegments for success, 0 for defer failure, and
-1 for permanent failure should be enough. The SCSI path is easy at
least, as we can just ask for a defer there. The internal qc_issue is a
little more tricky.
The NCQ patches have logic to handle this, although for other reasons
(to avoid overlap between NCQ and non-NCQ commands). It could easily be
reused for this as well.
