The serial support code newly allows selecting the max number of serial
ports. This computer has one s-port so i typed '1'.
 config SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS
 int "Maximum number of 8250/16550 serial ports"
 depends on SERIAL_8250
 default "4"
 help
 Set this to the number of serial ports you want the driver
 to support.  This includes any ports discovered via ACPI or
 PCI enumeration and any ports that may be added at run-time
 via hot-plug, or any ISA multi-port serial cards.
I found the value needs to be at least '4' or we oops at rmmod
serial_core.  2.6.13-rc1-git2 kernels with values from one through four
were tested.
