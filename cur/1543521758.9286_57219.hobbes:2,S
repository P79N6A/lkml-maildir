No, because that would make everything that includes kmod.h depend on
CONFIG_KMOD. The best way we found so far (based on Keith's suggestion) is
to have just one request_module() function which treats variable arguments
and is reduced to return -EINVAL if CONFIG_KMOD is not defined. This way
all the knowledge about CONFIG_KMOD is concentrated in kmod.c. Also,
kmod.h header should vanish and request_module() live in module.h

It may well be the end of the world, if you only have 4 seconds to repair
some nuclear missile system (powered by Linux) and recompiling the whole
kernel will take 25.1 seconds if everything depends on CONFIG_KMOD....

those exceptional cases, e.g. loading a binary will be given a bit more
thought and performance analysis. If we find less than 0.01% degradation
then the beauty argument wins. (I hope).
