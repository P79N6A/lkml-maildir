Jari,
since mainline cryptoloop/dm-crypt implementation is being changed right
now and you were complaining about it in the past, can you participate in
the discussions (there's also a parallel thread titled "[PATCH/proposal]
dm-crypt: add digest-based iv generation mode") so you don't have to
complain afterwards?
