Rusty,
When trying to compile 2.5.59 after patching with modversions.patch,
modversions2.patch and modversions-less-magic.patch I discovered a tiny
glitch which prevents compilation.
The culprit is a missing opening brace in modversions2.patch on line 72
(underlined below)
+#ifdef CONFIG_MODVERSIONING
+       if ((mod->symbols.num_syms && !crcindex)
+           || (mod->gpl_symbols.num_syms && !gplcrcindex)) {
							   ^^^
Also, whatever happened to modversions.h? A module I have refuses to
compile without it. I'm not yet such a good hacker to figure out how your
new modversions implementation works 8) 
Oh, and can you please cc: me since I'm not subscribed.
Cheers
