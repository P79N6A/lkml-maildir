Luben,
Thanks for submitting the patch, however, it appears part of it is wrong:
-               if ((command->status == 0xc7) || (command->status == 0xcb))
{
+               if (command->status & 0xC1) {
What makes you think you should not check for c7 or cb, and only check c1? 
Do you have the controller firmware spec in front of you?

Subject: [PATCH] 3w-xxxx: additional ata->sense codes, avoid driver
lockup
A few of our IDE hds were generating those errors.
The first one locks up the 3w-xxxx driver (into an inf. loop)
when the error register = 0x11; this also resulted sometimes
in kernel lockup, also when doing raidstop...
The second one (0x51 move) is for completely broken
sectors/medium -- this makes SCSI core figure this one out
quickly and do the appropriate action, rather than retry
the command several times + timeout, of course without
success.
For the status byte, we're more generous (actually only interested
in the error bit); if found, good, else the effect is the same.
