It doesn't hurt, except when I find it is already defined in one place
as 15 (kernel) and in the other place as 18 (userland) and the only
way I figure it out is to start instrumenting things to find out what
values it picked up for various macros only to discover that the same
macro has a completely different value in the kernel scope than it
does in userland scope...sigh.
