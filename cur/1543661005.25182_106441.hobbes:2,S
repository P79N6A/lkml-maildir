I got 2.4.21-pre4 which has your x86_64 updates. It works MUCH better.
Still some problems remain:
1. One unknown ioctl is logged from RH8.0 init:
ioctl32(iwconfig:185): Unknown cmd fd(3) cmd(00008b01){00} arg(ffffda90) on socket:[389]
2. gdb still seems broken. gdb ./sleep [where ./sleep is simply main() calling
   nanosleep(), but linked with -lpthread] hangs or loops and takes forever
   to respond to ^C.
3. bootsect.S still needs a patch to prevent 'bzdisk' kernels from
   disabling the FDC
