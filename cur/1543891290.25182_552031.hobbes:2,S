You still dont get it i think: in real life we end up using the TSC in 
sched_clock() _much more often_ than we end up using the TSC for 
clocksource! So your flawed suggestion does not fix anything, it in fact 
introduces a really bad regression: instead of using the TSC (or 
jiffies) we'd end up using the pmtimer or hpet for every lock operation 
when lockstat is enabled, bringing the box to a screeching halt in 
essence.
so what you suggest has a far worse effect on the _majority_ of systems 
that are even interested in running lockstat, than the case you 
mentioned that some seldom-used arch which is lazy about sched_clock() 
falls back to jiffies granularity. It's not a big deal: the stats will 
have the same granularity. (the op counts in lockstat will still be 
quite useful)
sched_clock() is a 'fast but occasionally inaccurate clock', while the 
GTOD clocksource is an accurate clock (but very often slow).
