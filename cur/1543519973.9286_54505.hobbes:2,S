A very small thing.
I would like the ability to load a gzipped filesystem into the ramdisk and
root mount it, from a device other than the floppy drive (in this case,
the cdrom drive).
Currently, the following check in rd_load_disk(...) seems to prevent this:
        if (MAJOR(ROOT_DEV) != FLOPPY_MAJOR
#ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD
                && MAJOR(real_root_dev) != FLOPPY_MAJOR
#endif
        )
                return;
When I comment it out, all is well.  I was thinking somebody might want to
take 30 seconds to clean this up (or perhaps to inform me of my insanity).
Btw, I've made a read-only version of Linux that boots from CD and makes
no changes to the host PC.  We use it for disaster recovery.  Hence the
need...
Thanks!
