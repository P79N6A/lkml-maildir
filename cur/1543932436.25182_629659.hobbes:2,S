Duh - I rebooted into the new kernel and no longer see the behavior I 
described above. Maybe I had something going in
the background i didn't realize. Thing was I even started a bash empty 
while loop to see if /proc/cpuinfo speed would go
up and it did.
I have an applet that displays on my kde kicker panel that every 2 
seconds reads /sys/.../cpuinfo_cur_freq and it was
sitting on the max speed all the time. Hmmm.
Well Thanks for the response and sorry for the false alarm.
Steve
