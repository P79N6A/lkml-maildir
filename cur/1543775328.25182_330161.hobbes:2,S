An if(usec > 2000) { printk(..); dump_stack(); } will do.
But do you really want to do this? There might be legitimate reasons
to compute udelay's parameter with results which are sometimes large.
If you really want to, let's decide on this limit now,
before patch cooking. I err to conservative (large) limit
(mostly in order to catch math underflows) or no limit at all.
