Yes, fixing.

Yes, fixing.

I can't think of any application that would do that, but it seems as
vmalloc() starts off with size = PAGE_ALIGN(size), so I could as well
do it myself to and calculate max_ngroups out of that size insted.

Because I didn't think of a static struct declaration, thanks.

Looks like ATOMIC_INIT should do...

I have implemented this in my new patch, there is a few, but vital 
processes that has never been allocated any groups. But I do think that
I 
can let count start at one, as sys_setgroups will just reuse it if
max_ngroups is large enough and the initial-groups-struct will have
max_ngroups == 0.

Right, I was more into the problem with mutal-exclution, I think that
the
count is right, it follows the p->user->count so if that one is right
this one should also be right.
I have been thinking about the mutal-exclution problem for a while, and
I
see it this way:
There might be a raise, it could be possible that sys_setgroups would be
called and that it checks the reference-count and decide to reuse the
groups struct and that frok get to be called before the "change" has
taken place, and it may render in that the child process will "change"
groups along with its mother. If it is possible to call fork when
setgroups is called with kernel-threads, then this might happen, but
as I see it it is undefined in the current case to, as it depends on
when the task_struct is copied. sys_setgroup sets ngroup at the end
so there will never be any time when there is undefined data in the
array inside the ngroups range.
There still is one bug in this, if a process joins a enough groups and
then reads /proc/self/status it will print all group-ids even if there
isn't space left in the buffer. What to do in this case? The best way
I can see at the moment would be to rewrite the proc-code for
/proc/<pid> to support unlimited length for the "file". What do other
people think?
