Thought in my opinion all these moves away won't pay off at the end 
anyway, because if in the "first" world countries are only un-employeed 
people because all their jobs have been moved into "third" world 
countries because there they can pay the people only a bean a day, then 
_nobody_ will be able to buy their products in the end.
