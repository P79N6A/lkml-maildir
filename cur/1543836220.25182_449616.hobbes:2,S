Hi,
   Similar problems here also but in my case it said '2-level deep'
and I had different stuff after that message. AMD64/ NVidia MB. I
don't have a second Linux machine handle to do the remote boot console
thing. If it's important that I send in more info I'll get a camera or
something like that. Let me know if it's required.
   Anyway, not a one machine problem at all.
Cheers,
Mark
