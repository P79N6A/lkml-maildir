Oh, I'm not saying that your change is outright wrong, on the contrary I'd
say you have a better feel for what is needed than I do, but if you are 
finding
that the uninterruptible sleep case needs some tweaking then the same tweak
should be applied to all sleep cases. If there really is a difference, 
then its
just a fluke that the sleep paths in question use the type of sleep you are
testing for, and nothing more profound than that.
