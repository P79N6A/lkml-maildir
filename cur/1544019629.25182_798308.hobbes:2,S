I think you already know this answer isn't actual answer.
anybody know >1 mean expensive. a reviewer want to know why DEFAULT_SEEKS * 16
is best, not *10 nor *20.

if you don't consider other user and other usage case,
this file can't merge forever.
The top problem is, this file stay on non proper place.
then, MM folks don't review at all.
I think this patch need to receive MM folks review.
Greg, please drop this file from stagin awhile.
(of cource, my intention is this one file only, other hardware depended 
driver file is needed to staging)

strange usage.
you shouldn't use high order allocation on embedded machine.

I don't understand your intention.
if file server machine has tons NR_ACTIVE_FILE, this logic kill many 
process.
Do I misunderstand anything?
