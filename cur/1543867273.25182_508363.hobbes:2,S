Hi,
I've used 'git bisect' to track down a change in the latest git tree
that is causing dbus-daemon to sit and spin at the time GNOME launches,
preventing nautlius from ever running.
The bad commit is:

    [PATCH] Fix d_path for lazy unmounts
With that patch out, GNOME startup works just fine.  I have a strace of
the dbus process running showing the problem, if anyone thinks that will
help out any.
I'm running pretty new GNOME and dbus here:
	dbus 1.0.2
	gnome 2.16.2
	hal 0.5.7.1
	nautilus 2.16.3
Any ideas of things I can test?
thanks,
greg k-h
