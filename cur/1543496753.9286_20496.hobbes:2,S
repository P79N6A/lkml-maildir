Why not both?  Why not return the syscall with failure (and appropriate
error code) AND send a signal.  Signals are supposed to be async right?  The
signal handler, for those cap aware future apps, could flip a flag that they
program can check after getting the failed syscall for more capability
specific information.  Is this not doable?  Or is it, just not desirable?
