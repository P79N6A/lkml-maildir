Oh, i am sorry, resending it ..
Attached is a patch to bttv which fixes the following problems.
Affected cards and problems:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o VP-1020 (200103A) Tuning problems, device detection.
o VP-1020 (DST-MOT) Errors during tuning, device detection fails in a while.
o VP-1030 (DST-CI) Tuning sometimes fails after CI commands.
o VP-2031 (DCT-CI) Tuning problems
The timeout happens before the actual timeout occured in the MCU
on the board, and hence the problems.
Changes: (bttv-i2c.diff)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Changed the custom wait queue to wait_event_interruptible_timeout()
      - Suggestion by Johannes Stezenbach.
o Fixed the wait queue timeout problem
      - This fixes the timeout problem on various cards.
      - This problem was visible as many
          * Cannot tune to channels, when signal levels are very low.
          * app_info does not work in some conditions for CI based cards
      - Smaller values worked good for newer cards, but the older cards
suffered, settled down to the worst case values that could happen in any
eventuality.
