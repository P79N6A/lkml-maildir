(re-sending my earlier reply to Klaus here on lkml too)
Klaus,
since you are using -rt, have you tried chrt-ing not only your audio
player but your audio IRQ as well? While playback is going on could you
create a system snapshot with the following tool:
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/tools/cfs-debug-info.sh
and send me the output file.
i'm also wondering why HZ=10000 makes a difference - audio interrupts
have no Linux-timer aspect normally (they are hardware timers in essence
themselves) - which portion of the workload is timing out so that HZ
shows up? Does the enabling of CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS help perhaps?
Also, do you have any advice for me how to reproduce your problem? I've
got a couple of PCs with various low-end/chipset-based audio hw, but the
buffers are generally large (around 500 msecs) so i rarely run into any
xrun problems. Is your player available for download so i could try it?
