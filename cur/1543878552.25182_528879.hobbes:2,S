Mikes -j5 workload is AFAIAC, a very realistic workload for building a 
kernel.  My own script I just discovered was using -j8, and that was 
noticeable, but by no means a killing hit on my poor old Xp2800 Athlon.  
I pulled it back to 4 for this mornings build and the hit, while less, is 
still noticeable.  Killer hit?  No way.  Using Mike's v4 patch I think it 
was called.
