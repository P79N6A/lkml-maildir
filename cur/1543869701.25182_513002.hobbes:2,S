Yes, spawning a new thread is costly.  However, if someone writes their
own thread-based program and allocates the threads from a pool, that
argument is irrelevant.  Even with fibrils, you have a stack and
scheduling overhead.  With kernel AIO, you have also have some memory
overhead, and you also have context switch overhead when you call
kick_iocb or aio_complete.
Can someone point me at hard evidence one way or another?

It seems to me that you're arguing that URBs and AIOCBs go together on
the basis that they are both asynchronous and both have some sort of
completion function.  Just because two things are alike doesn't mean
that it's better to use them together.

That's not what I said.  I don't think that the libc implementation is
more complex than the kernel AIO implementation.  The libc code is
smaller than the kernel AIO (the core code in aio_misc.c is 721 lines,
while the kernel AIO core code is 1769 lines).  The libc code is simpler
and easier to understand, and therefore may be less error prone.

Where is this documentation?  There's a man page on io_submit, etc., but
how would an application writer know to look for it?  I've grepped
through the Documentation directory, and I didn't find anything that
looked relevant.

Do you think that fibrils will replace the kernel AIO?  It seems like a
logicial conclusion, but does the kernel AIO give you anything more?
For example, I think it currently allows drivers to guarantee that the
requests will be queued in the order they are submitted.  GNU libc and
fibrils can't make that guarantee because the operations may block
before the request enters the hardware queue.

GNU libc can overlap I/O.  It implements the userland equivalent of
fibrils.  No one is arguing that we don't need I/O overlap. :)

Yes, a sane interface to the USRP was one of the main motivations for
the new USB filesystem.  It remains to be seen whether we need a
non-standard interface like io_submit, or whether threads with blocking
I/O is fast enough and has the right semantics.
