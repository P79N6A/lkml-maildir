Yes, that makes a lot of sense. After the reset I went into my own kernel 
with both ext2 and ext3 compiled into it. However, before the reboot, I was 
still in the RH kernel (99% sure it was so, but my memory might be 
deceiving me).
Is there any Right Way(TM) to fix this situation considering I want to have 
both ext2 and ext3 in my kernels (apart from the obvious of changing the 
order fs are called during root mount in the kernel)?
Thanks,
         Anton
