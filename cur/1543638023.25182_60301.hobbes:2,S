... unless the disk blocks are coming in due to a sequential stream
that's much larger than memory, in which case paging out user data to
expand the buffer cache is an exercise in futility that makes the system
behave sluggishly long AFTER the stream is done streaming through.
I see this behavior every morning after the nightly backup is done
(pulling in about 20 GB of data on a 256MB machine) -- my window manager
and browser are absurdly sluggish for about 20 seconds.
