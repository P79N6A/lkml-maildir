No political plot -- this posting was an RFC in the literal sense,
with no expectation that the code is mergable as-is.  I just want to
get comments early so that we have a better idea of what needs to be
fixed.  For example, what's your feeling about sysctls in drivers?
BTW, Pathscale people -- please respond to the comments that are made
about your driver...
