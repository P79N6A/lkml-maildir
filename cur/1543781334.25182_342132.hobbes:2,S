Hrm, I got dropped from the Cc list...? No worries, I'm subscribed in
two places :)
I think your reference to "last time" is the KJ patches which probably
used msleep{,_interruptible}() instead of schedule_timeout(). This
patchset, in contrast, should result in *no* functional changes (beyond
some more precisie conversions, where appropriate).
schedule_timeout_interruptible(some_value), for instance is nothing more than:
	set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
	schedule_timeout(some_value);
Just in the form of a combine function call. No loops like msleep() &
co.
Is the patch still a problem?
Thanks,
Nish
