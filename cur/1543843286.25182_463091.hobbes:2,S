Hi,
Following an advice Christoph gave me this summer, submitting a smaller,
easier to review patch should make everybody happier. Here is a stripped
down version of LTTng : I removed everything that would make the code
review reluctant (especially kernel instrumentation and kernel state dump
module). I plan to release this "core" version every few LTTng releases
and post it to LKML.
Comments and reviews are very welcome.
See

instrumentation set.
