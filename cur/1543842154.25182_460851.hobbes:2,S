  I think that the change to ll_rw_block() just widens the window much
more...

  Actually that part of commit code needs rewrite anyway (and after that
rewrite you get rid of ll_rw_block()) because of other problems - the
code assumes that whenever buffer is locked, it is being written to disk
which is not true... I have some preliminary patches for that but they
are not very nice and so far I didn't have enough time to find a nice
solution.
