So there is no common zqy of doing this, my docs say something about a
vga control register zhich is accesses trough the sequencer regs. Does
vgafb (or textmode or whatever) not call this when giving the hand to
the fbdev ?

Mmm, what about interaction with X ? X also does a save/restore of the
previous (text) mode, when a X driver is _not_ fbdev aware, it will
save/restore the things twice, right ?

Ok, i will try.
