Well, sort of. bogoMIPS is derived from loops_per_jiffy, which when
using the PIT as a time source is how many busy-wait loops occur in a
timer tick.  However when using the TSC as a timesource, the __delay()
function busy waits for a number of cycles. This increases the accuracy,
as interrupts taken do not affect the delay time. So in this case
bogoMIPS becomes the number of cpu cycles per tick. When using the
cyclone time source (the off chip performance counter) on the x440, it
becomes the number of cyclone cycles per tick.
