I think you should actually sleep for 2 jiffies here. You have asked
to sleep for _at least_ 1 real millisecond and you really don't care
about the number of jiffies that is. Depending on when the last timer
interrupt had fired, the next jiffy might be in another microsecond.
So I think you really must sleep for that extra jiffy (but 3 is too
many I think). Notice your first graphs are actually bad, because
some sleeps are much less than 1000us.
I don't know much about the timer code though, perhaps you do need to
sleep for 3 jiffies...
