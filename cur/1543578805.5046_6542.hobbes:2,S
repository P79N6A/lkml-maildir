Hi.
The following trivial patch cleans up some unneeded zero initializations in
drivers/net/yellowfix.c. Applies cleanly against 2.4.0p3 and with a bit of
fuzz against ac9 too.

Question: If you could live forever, would you and why?  
Answer: I would not live forever, because we should not live forever,
because if we were supposed to live forever, then we would live forever,
but we cannot live forever, which is why I would not live forever.
