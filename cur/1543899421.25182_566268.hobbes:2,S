Adrian, thanks.  I was able to reproduce this compiler error.  But I think
there may be a problem with the mainline kernel itself.
Unionfs defines its fsync file op to file_fsync.  file_fsync, defined in
fs/sync.c, appears to be a generic syncing function that can be used by
other file systems.  In fact, the comment above it says "Generic function to
fsync a file."  From fs/Makefile, it looks like sync.c gets compiled
regardless whether CONFIG_BLOCK is defined or not.
Moreover, file_fsync() makes a call to sync_blockdev(), clearly a function
which depends on CONFIG_BLOCK=y.  However, include/linux/buffer_head.h
defines sync_blockdev() to a noop if CONFIG_BLOCK=n:
  static inline int sync_blockdev(struct block_device *bdev) { return 0; }
This further indicates to me that someone went through the effort of making
file_fsync available and operational *even* if CONFIG_BLOCK=n.
But here's the problem: if CONFIG_BLOCK=n, the function file_fsync exists
and gets compiled into the kernel, but the extern definition for it is not
compiled in (it's wrapped in an #ifdef CONFIG_BLOCK in buffer_head.h).  This
looks to me like a discrepancy: why compile the file_fsync function, and
even ensure that it will find a dummy sync_blockdev() symbol, if one doesn't
provide an extern for it?
One more oddity: the EXPORT_SYMBOL for fs/sync.c:file_fsync() is in
fs/buffer.c, and buffer.c does not get compiled if CONFIG_BLOCK=n.  I
thought all EXPORT_SYMBOL calls are supposed to be near their respective
functions, no?
I suggest one of two things:
1. If you agree with me as to this discrepancy, then we can move the extern
   for file_fsync() outside the #ifdef CONFIG_BLOCK in buffer_head.h -- it
   should be defined regardless.  Then move the EXPORT_SYMBOL(file_fsync)
   from buffer.c to sync.  I can provide a small patch right away.
2. If you disagree, then I can change Unionfs to avoid calling file_fsync
   directly.  I can define a unionfs_fsync file method which does the usual
   stuff (pass the op to the layer below).
My preference is option #1; I'd like to avoid defining any more stackable
wrappers than I have to.
Thanks,
Erez.
