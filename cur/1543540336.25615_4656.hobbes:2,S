I don't think it is more made up than e.g. lmbench doing getpid() all 
the time to test syscall latency. The other system is simulated by the
cache trashing. Doing it completely from user space would probably
add so many other variables and variances that the results would be hard
to interpret.
Instead I chose to benchmark the single function I care about directly.

It stands for hash yes. single_pointer_head_list would be more accurate, but
I didn't like the sphlist name. Its most common use is probably hash tables,
so I chose the h- prefix instead.

I'm not sure about that. Once you did the iget() the inode should be cached
in the dentry, so it is unlikely that LRU will do much good. For the dcache
hash it may be a better idea, but are there that many workloads that always
open/link/iget the same file ? If they do all the necessary cache lines
for hash head and inode list are probably in cache, so it'll go like smoke.
It'll get a lot slower when it falls out of CPU cache. The patch tries
to make this very slow case much more unlikely (50%)
