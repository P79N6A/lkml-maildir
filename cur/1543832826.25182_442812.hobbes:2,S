The tty is obviously one and the same as:
a. "tty" in the kernel's struct signal_struct
b. the "TTY" or "TT" reported by ps.
c. what "/dev/tty" refers to
Any other tty is not "the tty". Exactly one tty is special.
On any of Linux, MacOS, Solaris, NetBSD, OpenBSD:
$ ls /dev/tty /dev/ctty
ls: /dev/ctty: No such file or directory
/dev/tty
Lord only knows why FreeBSD has both.
Unlike Linux, they don't supply a man page.
On a Linux system, "man 4 tty" is useful.
On a Solaris system, "man -s 7d tty" is useful.
