the issue is *runnable* tasks.  do your machines routinely report
loadaverages of 1000?  if so, I'm impressed!
the issue here is whether someone can come up with a maintainable
scheduler that has the requisite performance.  since the runqueue is 
normally short, the scheduler's performance function must have a
very small constant term.  if it's true that there are applications
that result in long runqueues, then the performance curve needs to 
be as flat and horizontal as possible, again, without degrading the 
constant term.
AFAIK, loopback volanomark does not resemble _any_ real application.
