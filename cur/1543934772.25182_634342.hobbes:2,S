Actually it will detect 4GB, but put the PCI hole over the last GB.
One way to get more usable memory is to configure the BIOS to use a smaller
PCI hole (e.g. use smaller frame buffer/aperture etc.)

The chipset limitation applies to 64bit mode as well as to 32bit mode
(which actually does not have a 4GB limitation with PAE)
