I cannot believe that this is the correct solution and, if it is, the
name of the variable ought to be changed.
More likely, I suspect that the mask wants to be 39-bits, what with its
name and all.
The problem is that DMA addresses come in both 32-bit (generic) and
64-bit (high) forms.  mask_39bit is a dma_addr_t so it is 64-bit if
CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G and 32-bit otherwise.  Possibly, the right solution is
to make mask_39bit dma64_addr_t.  Or, if the mapping needs to be
consistent, assign a different value depending on the value of
CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G.
See Documentation/DMA-*.txt for more information.
