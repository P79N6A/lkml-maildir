I'd love to help, but I'm a bit of a newbie; what's protocol for
documentation updates, standard diffs?
How are we going to attack this thing, cleaning up and updating existing
documentation first and then adding undocumented items, or file by file
updating and adding in one fell swoop?
At any rate, I'm in.
Hopefully this will turn out better than the last time I said those
words and woke up in Mexico with a new tattoo and without my pants.  :)
