Hi guys,
I wanted to give you a preview of the CPUID revision patch; it is not
100% ready yet in that (a) it still has a bunch of debugging printk() and
(b) I haven't ported over mtrr.c yet.
This code took a lot longer to write than I had expected, mostly because
I kept running into various forms of bugs with the *old* code.  In fact,
it looks like some of the bugs involving CPUID feature flags in the past
have been due to the inconsistent handling of these flags in Linux.  I
believe the new code should be a lot better in this aspect, and should
avoid bugs as much as possible.
I would very much like this code to be tested and get success/fail
reports on various CPUs, *especially* AMD (Athlon especially) and Cyrix
chips.
As I mentioned, you will have to compile without MTRR support in this
version.  I should have that fixed soon.
The patch is at:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hpa/cpuid-2.4.0-test11-pre2-1.diff
In case of success, please send me the output of the new /proc/cpuinfo on
your system.  In case of failure, please compile and run the following
program and send me the output, as well as /proc/cpuinfo from an
unpatched kernel version:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hpa/cpuid.c
Many thanks,
	-hpa
