Hi,
I have a similar issue. The network drops away randomly for short periods (several to ten(s) seconds).
Strange enough nothing is reported is syslog, and indeed from the machine itself pinging works perfectly to another machine.
From that other machine however the connections looks dead in those periods...
I'm running kernel 2.6.18.8-0.5-default on a SUSE 10.2 machine with a ASUS M2NPV-VM board.
Have tried both the default "0.59" and "0.62-Driver Package V1.23" version of forcedeth
Tried 2 BIOSes: 0901 and 1001.
Also have tried several kernel options independently: noapic, pci=routeirq, acpi=off, pci=nomsi
All did not help.
Any suggestions?
BTW I'm not subscribed, please CC me personally.
Thanks in advance,
