I agree.  The change to do this is to use the del_timer_sync() or the 
del_singleshot_timer() code.
It is possible and desirable to be able to delete a running timer.  We don't 
want to take it away from the timer call back routine, however, as that leads to 
"bad things".  That is why these two del_* routines were written.
