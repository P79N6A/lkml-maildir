IMHO, a cpufreq driver have to not do things like that.  It's up to
a common library made eventually by ACPI folks to go.  And AFAIK
Dominik do make some patch for that.  There is not only the K8 that
can benefit from what you want to add (K7, Pentium M,...).

Still IMHO, people that want to disable ACPI, but want to be able to
lower the frequency of their processor don't know what they loose.  The
ACPI C-state, for which ACPI provide a good way to save powers in the
idle loop today.  But, I have seen broken BIOS, or bug in the current
ACPI implentation, that do not permit to enable ACPI under Linux, so
unless those issues are resolved, there may be still a need to support
legacy configuration.
BTW, an other drawback for only ACPI config.  I have a K7 mobile
for which I do have only 5 P-state on the ACPI side, instead
of 9 as reported by the legacy method.  One of the P-state is
also broken (the VID is too high).  I can't say of the 'quality'
of BIOS made for the K8 architecture, but it should be possible
that you get more appropriate information via the legacy table than
the one provided by ACPI..  One solution may be a setup at kernel
boot in order to configure the powernow-k8 with legacy method even
if ACPI is enabled, or even a DMI quirk if such (broken) platform are
known.
