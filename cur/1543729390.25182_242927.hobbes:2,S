Hm... With the current clear_page, we are filling 4KB of my
Pentium-III's 16 KB L1 d-cache (i.e. 25%) with zeroes.  I'm not
sure that we will use all of this data right away.
I would like to point out that the current arch/i386/lib/mmx.c
uses MMX movntq instructions #ifdef CONFIG_MK7 .
Apparently, bypassing the cache was considered a good idea
in that case.
What is a set of useful benchmarks to find out which approach
is better?  We should have some real-world programs that show
significant oprofile hits in clear_page or copy_page.
It might very well be that the results on Pentium-III and
Pentium-4 are different, for example that SSE is only useful
for a Pentium-III, and only for clear_page.
