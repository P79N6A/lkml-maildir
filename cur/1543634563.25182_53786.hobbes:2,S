Martin, I have the same problem on my Sony Vaio C1VE, 
Intel Corp. 82371AB/EB/MB PIIX4 IDE (rev 01), HITACHI_DK23AA-12 disk.
It doesn't even boot, the "DMA in progress error..." appears just
after having mounted the root partition. 2.5.23 worked on this laptop.
I've added, as you suggested the following patch:
===== drivers/ide/ide.c 1.110 vs edited =====

 		drive->sleep = 0;
 
 		if (test_bit(IDE_DMA, ch->active)) {
-			printk(KERN_ERR "%s: error: DMA in progress...\n", drive->name);
+			printk(KERN_ERR "%s: error: DMA in progress...%p\n", drive->name, ch->handler);
 			break;
 		}
And the bad news is that ch->handler is NULL...
