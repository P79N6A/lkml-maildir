Yes, definitely[1]... the problem is, and this is also true of other
annotations[2], that people go absolutely nuts adding these annotations
without doing any profiling to see whether they actually improve things.
I'd bet, in the __read_mostly case at least, that there's no
improvement in almost all cases.
cheers, Kyle
1. It's hugely relevant on big-SMP machines.
2. I mean __read_mostly, likely, unlikely, etc., not the useful sparse
annotations.
