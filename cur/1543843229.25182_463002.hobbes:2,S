One quick example:
4-disk SATA array rebuild on iop321 without acceleration - 'top'
reports md0_resync and md0_raid5 dueling for the CPU each at ~50%
utilization.
With acceleration - 'top' reports md0_resync cpu utilization at ~90%
with the rest split between md0_raid5 and md0_raid5_ops.
The sync speed reported by /proc/mdstat is ~40% higher in the accelerated case.
That being said, array resync is a special case, so your mileage may
vary with other applications.
I will put together some data from bonnie++, iozone, maybe contest,
and post it on SourceForge.
