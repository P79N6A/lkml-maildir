those are technical arguments - i'm not sure how you can understand them 
to be "personal preferences". The only personal preference i have is 
that in the end a technically most superior solution should be merged. 
(be that one project or the other, or a hybrid of the two) The analysis 
of which one is a better solution depends on pros and cons - exactly 
like the ones listed above. If they are solvable problems then please 
let me know how you would solve them and when you (or others) would 
solve them, preferably before merging the code. Right now they are 
pretty heavy cons as far as LTT goes, so obviously they have a primary 
impact on the topic at hand (whic is whether to merge LTT or not).
