  Last time I have checked, scheduler handles priority of processes
without any "time hog detector" in userspace, yet nice(1) is used all the
time. It can argued that daemon can help to set policies for running
processes, but the possibility to at least set policy on the program
startup by some wrapper should improve situation a lot compared to what it
is now.
