	How can you get an application to recognize those special Windows keys
	that the newer keyboards have (usually where the CTRL/ALT keys are)?
man loadkeys
	My keyboard also has a special set of Internet keys, used for browser
	functions. Is there any way to get an app to see these as well? They don't
	generate scan codes, at least, not that I can determine.
If they don't do anything I am afraid they won't be very useful.
