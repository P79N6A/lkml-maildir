Ok, do you like this slightly better?  It states the subsystem, the 
function with the error, the block nr. in the case of a too-large block,
and the block device on which the error occurred.  Honestly minix.fsck
doesn't handle the situation well either, so at this point I hesitate
to recommend it in the print.  :)
--------------------------
This attempts to address CVE-2006-6058
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6058
 
first reported at 
http://projects.info-pull.com/mokb/MOKB-17-11-2006.html
Essentially a corrupted minix dir inode reporting a very large
i_size will loop for a very long time in minix_readdir, minix_find_entry,
etc, because on EIO they just move on to try the next page.  This is
under the BKL, printk-storming as well.  This can lock up the machine
for a very long time.  Simply ratelimiting the printks gets things back
under control.  Make the message a bit more informative while we're here.
