How about this for a ChangeLog (also created from memory and from some
of your inlined comments):
    Do not follow pagetables for VM_IO regions, they might
    not have pageframes.
    Discovered when an mlockall'ed program tried to mmap
    some device's registers (using /dev/mem); the program
    hangs on the mmap, looping forever in get_user_pages(),
    trying to do a follow_page() that never succeeds.
