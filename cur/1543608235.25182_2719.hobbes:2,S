It's a compilation option to never compress gz files. I guess it would
be easy to add others (bz2, Z, jpg, mp3, ...) to the list?. The max
chunk used for compression is 32KB and again this is configurable, as
is the compression method/level used. The alogorithms are gzip (1-9),
LZO, bz2.

Only if the file is in a directory with the +c attribute set.
You can have full control over the compression.
Note this transparent ext2 compression patch is only available for 2.2
