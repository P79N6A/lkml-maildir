Hello,
I created a kernel thread inside of my driver by calling the function 
kernel_thread with a function pointer. Now this thread calls daemonize 
and allow_signal and then it runs a forever loop until it is terminated 
by the kernel (unloading the driver etc). And because it is written in 
the documentation I put the thread asleep by calling 
wait_event_interruptible with a wait queue called "dpn_wq_run" inside 
the forever loop. Now is it right that a wake_up_interruptible in the 
ISR has to wake up the thread so it continues its work? If yes... why 
isn't that working for me? I called wait_event_interruptible with that 
dpn_wq_run inside the kernel thread and do a wake_up_interruptible 
inside the ISR with the same dpn_wq_run. But my kernel thread won't wake 
up. Is there anything else I have to do to the wait queue, but calling 
init_wait_queue on it?
Thanks a lot
Hendrik
