Of course there are use cases for STD... lots of them... that's why
I'm maintaining it.
It has some "interesting" use cases, like suspend on one machine,
transfer image to identical one, resume there, dual-boot to windows;
there are "normal" use cases, like machines not capable of S3.
I hope we are not dropping STD just now...
