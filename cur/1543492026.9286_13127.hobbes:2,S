In that case, I suggest you have a really good read of the POSIX
specification, like I did before writing that message. I'm sure you
will soon spot the part that negates your claim above...

Note that NOBODY has stated that additional arguments not specified by
POSIX are bugs, and also note that the POSIX standard explicitly
refutes any such claim to start with.

Not quite: To be POSIX compliant, it is required to comply with the
specified behaviour IRRESPECTIVE of any non-standard arguments that
may be supplied. That's why true IS compliant, and false is NOT.

Horse Manure.

As has been stated several times, the comments regarding number of
arguments are irrelevant, as the POSIX standard explicitly allows
them. What is in question is the exit code, in which respect false is
NOT POSIX compliant without the above patch having been applied.
Best wishes from Riley.
