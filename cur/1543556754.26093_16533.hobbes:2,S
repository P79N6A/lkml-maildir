  As a potential real-world case (but possibly unrelated), I had an
interesting situation crop-up while I was playing with the loopback
filesystems.
  If you just use the program-tools, you end up with a situation like:
	losetup <blah> [close all] dd <blah> [close all] losetup -d [blah]
  In my case, I was making a standalone program that did it all in one
program and I messed up in the ordering of the close() and the LOOP_CLR_FD.
  I'm pretty sure that (with my small 10K test dataset) the I/O between
the loopback device and the looped file was never hitting the disk.
If I LOOP_CLR_FD before I closed, I ended up with bad data in the looped
file and kernel errors syslogged:
	kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
	kernel: 07:00: rw=1, want=1, limit=0
	kernel: dev 07:00 blksize=0 blocknr=0 sector=0 size=1024 count=1
  I tended to get 10 of those, one for each of the 10 1K blocks in
my test dataset.
  Doing the close() then the LOOP_CLR_FD got rid of the errors.
