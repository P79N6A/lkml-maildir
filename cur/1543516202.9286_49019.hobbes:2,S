Hallo,
today I migrated my computing environment from a Asus P5A K6 to a dual 
celeron an a Abit BP6. I unplugged the cards in one chassis and
transferred them to the new one and finally got everything booting and 
running with the old (2.2.13pre10) uniprocessor compiled kernel. Then
I fetched 2.2.13 and patched it to pre5 with SMP enabled, but no
networking option changed.
With the uniprocessor kernel, my (quite old, 1997 vintage)
3c905 PCI card was recognized at IRQ9:

Nov 15 17:21:36 hertz kernel: eth1: 3Com 3c905 Boomerang 100baseTx at\
0xa400,  00:60:97:11:c0:98, IRQ 9
The SMP kernel had trouble with that card:

kernel:   Flags; bus-master 1, full 0; dirty 16 current 16.
Going back to the UP kernel made the problems go away again, but even
v0.99L didn't help in the SMP case.
So I decided to move the card to some other PCI slot where it got
another IRQ 
hertz kernel: eth1: 3Com 3c905 Boomerang 100baseTx at 0xa400,  00:60:97:11:c0:98, IRQ 11
hertz kernel:   8K word-wide RAM 3:5 Rx:Tx split, MII interface.
hertz kernel:   MII transceiver found at address 24, status 782f.
hertz kernel:   Enabling bus-master transmits and whole-frame receives.
where it worked again.
/proc/interrupts doesn't show anything else on IRQ9:
bash-2.02# cat /proc/interrupts

NMI:          0

Has anybody an idea why it didn't work with IRQ9?
