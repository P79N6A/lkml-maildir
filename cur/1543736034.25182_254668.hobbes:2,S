By adding appropriate printk's to copy_files(), it appears that
many many processes have a -1 in the highest non-zero fd pointer.
The crash that I see seems to happen when there is another nearby
fd that is open, (nearby==within the same 8-bit bitmask) so that the
"open_files" value is larger than/equal-to the highest non-zero
fd pointer (which is set to -1), thus leading to crash.  The "race"
is that these high fd's normally close pretty quickly, and thus,
"open_files" usually has a much smaller value.
