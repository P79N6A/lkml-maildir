I'm a little surprised; I would have expected the other patch to be the 
one responsible.  Are you sure you got the right one?
Your symptoms suggest that the ksuspend_usbd and khubd kernel threads
are in deadlock.  You could verify this by getting an Alt-SysRq-T stack 
trace of the two threads after resuming.  Andrew Morton saw this 
happen, under slightly different circumstances, on his system.
If this is indeed the case, the patch below ought to fix your problem.  
Essentially it replaces calls to flush_workqueue() with
cancel_sync_work().  I sent it to Andrew last week, but his problem
occurs only sporadically so it's hard to test.

We'll know for certain after Mark tries this patch.  However at the 
moment I doubt that freezing the kernel threads has anything to do with 
the problem.
BTW, you mentioned in an earlier email that for suspend-to-RAM, instead
of freezing tasks we should freeze I/O.  It's a good idea, but have you
considered how much overhead it would add?  Even if the necessary
changes are confined to the subsystem level, just think about what
would happen for example with char device drivers.
The only common subsystem they share is VFS.  Every entry point into
VFS would therefore need to test whether a suspend-to-RAM was in
progress, and if it was, block until the suspend was over.  Each of
these tests would be on a hot path -- not something we really want to
do if it is at all avoidable.
