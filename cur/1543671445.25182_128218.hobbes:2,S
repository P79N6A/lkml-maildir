Whew.  At least I'm not totally crazy, one person saw what I was saying.
I don't think it is exclusively the open source folks that have the 
business guys worried, they are also worried about the illegal wholesale
replication of the software which occurs in places like China.

If that's what you heard, I didn't get across what I meant.  In the
business world, it's a well established fact that you don't win by
copying the leader, the leader will always out distance you.
My message was that instead of sitting around copying other people's
programs, it would be far more interesting if the open source community
came up with original works on their own.  That's how you win.  It's a
lot more work but when you win, you really win.  In the copying model,
you are always playing catchup to the leader.
By the way, I wouldn't object to the copying so much if I didn't see it
as a threat to the open source community itself.  I take the long view
which says that if you look far enough out, if the open source community
is successful enough, there won't be anything left to copy.
That's not a problem except that the commercial companies are spending
the R&D to create new stuff and the open source guys using the proprietary
programs as a roadmap to make a free version.  Not a problem until you go
looking for a business model based on open source which can generate the
revenue that it takes to do something new.  Nobody has in the many years
I've pointed out this problem.
