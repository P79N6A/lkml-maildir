Further investigation into excessive scheduling latency reveals
that when switching from X to a virtual terminal and back causes
the ps2 mouse (in my case) to be written via aux_write_dev which
disables interrupts for about 3 msec.  The rtc_interrupt is
held off until interrupts are enabled.
This seems like a long time to have interrupts disabled, does 
anyone know of a safe alternative?
