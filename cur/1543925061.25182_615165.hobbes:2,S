Hi Andrew,
The kernel build fails with randconfig, with folllowing error
init/do_mounts.c: In function ‘name_to_dev_t’:
init/do_mounts.c:110: error: implicit declaration of function ‘blk_lookup_devt’
make[1]: *** [init/do_mounts.o] Error 1
make: *** [init] Error 2
This is caused by gregkh-driver-block-device.patch, where the function 
blk_lookup_devt is declared within #ifdef CONFIG_BLOCK and randconfig has
not set the CONFIG_BLOCK it.
