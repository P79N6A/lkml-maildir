Sorry to upset you.

Yep, it is bad... broken machines die. And while proposed patches
probably will not hurt, I do not think they will help, and I do not think
anyone will ever *test* them.

Agreed... so you  know that proposed patch would probably not prevent your old
box from self-destructing?

Are you sure that cpu_relax actually does somenthing on pre-pentium-4 machines?
