Part of the picture might be that code that was included into the kernel 
usually is in a state that it works at least most time for most of the 
people.
And when you think about distributions, it's hard to imagine why a 
distribution should not enable more or less all EXPERIMENTAL device 
drivers - an EXPERIMENTAL driver is much better than no driver for this 
hardware at all.
