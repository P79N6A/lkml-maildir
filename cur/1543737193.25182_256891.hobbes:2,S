Providing the driver isnt sticking its nose into ->ioctl the tty layer
core already correctly handles TCSETAW for you because it uses
tty_wait_until_sent before issuing the change. You don't have to deal
with that providing you've implemented driver->chars_in_buffer, and
if neccessary ->wait_until_sent.
In a waiting case the driver will get
	->chars_in_buffer
		until it returns zero
	->wait_until_sent
	->change_termios
which serializes with respect to the one writer. If you have a writer
during a termios change by another well tough luck, you lose and I've
no intention of changing that behaviour unless someone cites a standard
requiring it.
