Last time i used it, I didn't need to do a darn thing. I believe it's
part of the traps code, so you can just call dump_stack().
dump_stack() will throw out the trace of the current task's stack at
the point when it is called. See what happens when you place it in
different places. Another option, if you ever have a hanging sytem is
Alt-SysRq-T (presuming you have the magic option enabled and you are
able to scrollback still), which pretty much calls dump_stack() for
all available processes.
