Now this is news.  I wasn't aware there was a separate Read-For-Ownership
mode or signal.  Of course, any P6 write that misses the cache causes a
cache line fill, but I wasn't aware that this was different from a normal
read.  That would logically set "Invalid" on the other CPU.
This chitchat is nice, but a Linus says:  "Show me the code" .  And I've
been trying to break WB spinlocks by modifying Ingo's test code.  No such
luck.  I can have as many threads as I like pounding away on spinlocks
for 15-minutes to an hour without breakage.  Yet slip a tight coupled
spin_unlock()/spin_lock() pair in, and it breaks immediately as it's
supposed to.  So I have to admit WT spinlocks are safe, or I am stupid.
Or both :)
