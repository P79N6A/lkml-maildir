Hi Linus,
some more bug fixes for s390. 6 patches against linux-bk as of 2003/07/17.
Short descriptions:
1) Some minor stuff in arch/s390 and include/asm-s390.
2) Enable irq statistics for s390*. While we can't keep stats for all
   i/o interrupts (65536) and external interrupts (4), we can count
   all i/o interrupts and all external interrupts as two classes of
   interrupts.
3) Remove surplus put_disk in the dasd driver.
4) Common i/o layer fixes.
5) Qeth network driver fixes.
6) Correct size of siginfo_t for s390x.
blue skies,
  Martin.
