Yes, that should be doable. And passing in a cpumask is much better 
since we no longer
have to maintain mappings.
So the strawman is:
Listener bind()s to genetlink using its real pid.
Sends a separate "registration" message with cpumask to listen to. 
Kernel stores (real) pid and cpumask.
During task exit, kernel goes through each registered listener (small 
list) and decides which
one needs to get this exit data and calls a genetlink_unicast to each 
one that does need it.
If number of listeners is small, the lookups should be swift enough. If 
it grows large, we
can consider a fancier lookup (but there I go again, delving into 
implementation too early :-)
Sounds good to me !
