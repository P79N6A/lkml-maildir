Well, I suppose the "trick" would be to ensure that the top-level  
code can probe multiple independent busses in parallel, while  
allowing certain of those to serialize their execution order for  
whatever reason without changing the resulting linear order.  This  
would make it possible to have independent pci.multithread_probe=1  
and scsi.multithread_probe=1 arguments so the sysadmin can force  
serialization for one subsystem if they don't have their device- 
numbering issues with that subsystem entirely sorted out.
