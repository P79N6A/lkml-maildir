well, i personally am not against the current preempt mechanism from
the viewpoint of the audio-processing purpose :)  the implementation
is relatively clean and easy.
but i agree with Andrea, that surely we can achieve the alsmo same
RT-performance even without preemption, i.e. with less perempt
overhead.  it's not necessary to be default.

the above one is the major source of RT-latency.
only this oneliner will reduce more than 90% of RT-latencies.
in my case with reiserfs, i got 0.4ms RT-latency with my test suite
(with athlon 2200+).
there is another point to be fixed in the reiserfs journal
transaction.  then you'll get 0.1ms RT-latency without preemption.
for ext3, these two spots are relevant.

i think the first one is needed for preemptive kernel, too.
with these patches, also 0.1-0.2ms RT-latency is achieved.
