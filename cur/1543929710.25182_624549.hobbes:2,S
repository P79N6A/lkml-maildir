BTW, You may be better off using "uuidgen -t" to generate the UUID in
the smolt RPM, since that will use 12 bits of randomness from
/dev/random, plus the MAC, address and timestamp.  So even if there is
zero randomness in /dev/random, and the time is January 1, 1970, at
least the MAC will contribute some uniqueness to the UUID.
