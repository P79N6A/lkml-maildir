Gene-
By teletext, I assume you are referring to closed captions.  Are you 
sure that closed captions EVER worked for you on a cx88-based card?  
AFAIK, this feature has not yet been implemented.  I am not at home now, 
so I cannot try it, however, IIRC, closed captions is implemented in 
bttv, and not yet in cx88.
This is a v4l issue, not a dvb issue, however, it is NOT an issue.  This 
is not a regression, because the feature has not yet been implemented.
Gene, if I am wrong, (this is possible) then please provide the last 
kernel version that had this feature correctly implemented.  I don't 
think that I am wrong, though.  Please investigate this and confirm that 
this is an actual regression or not.
Cheers,
