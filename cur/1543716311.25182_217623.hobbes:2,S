Indeed. The driver in question contains 8 interdependent modules. What 
we were thinking of doing to settle the issue short-term in a fair way 
for both our users and kernel developers, is removing the \0 from the 
central one (hsfengine), causing the kernel to be properly tainted and 
one instance of the messages to be automatically printed when the 
driver is used.
Hopefully the community will view this as an acceptable compromise. 
Once patches have propagated onto people's computers, we will be happy 
to remove all \0's completely.
