  "You have taught us much. Come with us and join the movement."
  "This movement of yours, does it have slogans?" inquired the Chink.
  "Right on!" they cried. And they quoted him some.
  "Your movement, does it have a flag?" asked the Chink.
  "You bet!" and they described their emblem.
  "And does your movement have leaders?"
  "Great leaders."
  "Then shove it up your butts," said the Chink. "I have taught you nothing."
