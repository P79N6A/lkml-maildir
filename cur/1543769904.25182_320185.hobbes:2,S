This is a fusyn-specific optimization. INT_MAX is set to be the lowest
prio and the one used by non-PI waiters, so it will never interfere with
normal priorities. Because this is probably going to be most of the 
cases and we know it will always be the last one, it is a shortcut for
it.
It makes some sense, but in a more generic scenario, I might not.
