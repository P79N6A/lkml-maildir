Yes, that's buggy - the caller has a ref on the page, but not on the inode.
I'm not sure what's worth doing in there - maybe just trylock it and if
that fails, lose the I/O error.  Combine that with propagation of the page
error flags into the address_space within truncate_complete_page() and
invalidate_complete_page() and in shrink_list().  Does that cover
everything?
Or just kill handle_write_error() altogether and push the responsibility
for setting the address_space error bits into writepage() -
block_write_full_page() and mpage_writepage() do it already.
Let me think about it a bit.
