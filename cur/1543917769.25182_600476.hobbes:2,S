CIPSO is supported on SELinux as well. It certainly has uses where IPSec 
is excessive. One example is someone I talked to recently that basically 
has a set of blade systems connected with a high speed backplane that 
looks like a network interface. CIPSO is useful in this case because 
they can't afford the overhead of IPSec but need to transfer the level 
of the connection to the other machines. The backplane is a trusted 
network and that isn't a dangerous assumption in this case.
CIPSO also lets systems like SELinux and SMACK talk to other trusted 
systems (eg., trusted solaris) in a way they understand. I don't 
regularly support CIPSO as I believe IPSec labeling is more useful in 
more situations but that doesn't mean CIPSO is never useful.
