Is it possible you had a snapshot in the volume group when you started
lvm 0.9 the first time? snapshots are not persistent on pre3 so it doesn't make
sense to left them before rebooting the kernel, and maybe lvmtools 0.9 doesn't
cope correctly with non persistent snapshot created by 0.8 driver (trivial to
temporarly workaround, just delete any snapshot volume before using 0.9 lvm :).
