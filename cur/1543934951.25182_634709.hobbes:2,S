Yes, but that always required an external patchkit which AFAIK existed
only for 2.4. The point is that if you have to apply an external
patchkit anyways you can as well apply the small patches for these hooks 
too. But it doesn't make sense to carry the (admittedly minor) overhead
for this in all kernels. Also the ELF loader is quite hairy code
and any simplification of it helps.
