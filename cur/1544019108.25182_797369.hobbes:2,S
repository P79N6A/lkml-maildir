Thomas, Ingo,
Do we have any support in the kernel today to deal with a IRQ on the  
root PIC being used for both a chained PIC and shared with another HW  
device.  We have a board that guys went and did it and as I look at  
the kernel code it doesn't seem like this crazy situation is currently  
supported.
