There's a corruption bug in the page cache somewhere, and it's 100%
reproducable.  Finding it will be tough....

Usually this is performed in the BIOS setup.  You can also disable L1 
with a sequence of instructions that write to the CR0 register on intel
and flip a bit, but in doing this you have to execute a WBINV (write
back invalidate) instruction to flush out the cache.  BIOS setup is
probably simpler.  Disabling Level I will make the machine slower 
than mollasses, BTW, and if this bug is race related (they always 
are) it won't help much in running it down.
