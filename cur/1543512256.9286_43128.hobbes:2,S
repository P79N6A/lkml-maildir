Technical true, but changing it DOES affect userland:  there is still
code which assumes things about the size of major/minor numbers.  Look
at the assignment of ROOT_DEV in the various architectures.

Making kdev_t a structure is obviously the eventual, and best solution. 
But I disagree that making it a pointer is the easiest thing to do, or
that another large array is the way to go.  By keeping kdev_t an lvalue
you make it easier to update current code which doesn't use kdev_t.h
macros, or is in some other way "hairy".
Or to put it another way, keeping kdev_t an lvalue is the quickest
method to get me to the end result of larger major/minor numbers.
