But the incoming packets are those that I request to be sent to me (most times). 
When I know the packet size I will accept I may not request all packets now, but 
a bit later, to leave bandwidth for other requested packets of higher priority.

This is what I don't like, but I bet there must be a way to slow down the other 
end, even if it has not QoS.
What might help, and needs only be implemented on my side of the connection, is 
requesting the packets of higher priorities first. And if I know my total 
bandwidth, perhaps I can request as many packets needed to fill it (and not 
flood it like it happens now).
Thank you all for your attention,
