I previously noted that the TV picture is mispositioned by a few
hundred pixels when using the bttv drivers included in Linux 2.2 and
late 2.1 kernels to read from a Bt878 video card when display the
results on an 8MB ATI Rage Pro video card using the XFree86 3.3.3.1
Mach64 X server.
I recently discovered that this problem only occurs when the scan line
length is not a power of two.
This is xawtv-2.33, running on Linux/i586 (2.2.2)
v4l: device is BT878(Hauppauge old)
SHIFTED:  x11: 1600x1200, 16 bit/pixel, 3200 byte/scanline, DGA, VidMode
SHIFTED:  x11: 1280x1024, 16 bit/pixel, 2560 byte/scanline, DGA, VidMode
Centered: x11: 1024x768,  16 bit/pixel, 2048 byte/scanline, DGA, VidMode
SHIFTED:  x11:  800x600,  16 bit/pixel, 1600 byte/scanline, DGA, VidMode
This problem seems very similar to the one corrected by the
matrox_hack code, discussed on the video4linux list earlier this week:

I'd be happy to take Mark's patches and try to adopt them to cure my
ATI problem, but I'll need some guidance as to where the fix should
go: in the driver, in v4l-conf, or in xawtv?
