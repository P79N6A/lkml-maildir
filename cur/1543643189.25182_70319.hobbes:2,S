I don't think this is enough to justify a new subsystem like
statctr_t (struct statctr, please).
Looks like we can take the disk stats out of kernel_stat, move all
the vm-related things out of kernel_stat into struct page_state and
what's left of kernel_stat?
        unsigned int per_cpu_user[NR_CPUS],
                     per_cpu_nice[NR_CPUS],
                     per_cpu_system[NR_CPUS];
        unsigned int irqs[NR_CPUS][NR_IRQS];
And that's good, because "kernel statistics" was clearly too
broad a concept.  The above is just one concept: interrupts and
scheduler things.
I'll pull the VM accounting out of there; when you have a
close-to-final patch for the disk stats we can give it a whizz
in the -mm patches and then get all the userspace tools working
nicely against that, OK?
I'm not sure that I want to add 14 more fields to /proc/meminfo.
So a new /proc/vmstat may appear.  We would then have:
/proc/stat		scheduler things
/proc/diskstat		disk things
/proc/vmstat		vm things
