VMware suffers from same problem. Because of I do not support VMware

-I/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/arch/i386/mach-generic
in vmmon/vmnet Makefile, and for 2.5.x it is required to have full kernel 
source installed, not only kernel-headers package (if there is some distro
that distributes kernel-headers 2.5.x package...).

I think that behavior should be changed. irq_vectors.h (and eventually other .h) should
be moved to include/asm-i386/irq_vectors-generic.h (or irq_vectors-visws.h) and irq_vectors.h
should be either appropriate symlink, or simple 
#ifdef CONFIG_VISWS
#include <irq_vectors-visws.h>
#else
#include <irq_vectors-generic.h>
#endif
Or vendors should be taught to install properly configured kernel-sources by default,
so that we can use (cd /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build; make SUBDIRS=`pwd` modules) (or how
it works in 2.5.x kbuild) instead of just trying to guess compiler, compiler options
and include paths because of by default vendors's sources are configured for something 
else than running kernel (f.e. -Xcustom instead of -X in EXTRAVERSION in main makefile).
