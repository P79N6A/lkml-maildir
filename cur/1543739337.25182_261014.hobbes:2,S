I am interested but I probably wouldn't have the time to look at it right

What about non-x86 platforms such as PowerPC and MIPS embedded devices 
that want video (TiVo type platforms, media players etc). How would these 
fit into the picture? Would this require the boot loader (ie: U-Boot or 
whatever) to have the ability to POST the card? 
Or perhaps the VideoBoot module would be a useful addition to the VGA 
boot driver compiled into the kernel to bring up the video card into a 
sane state on any system (even a dumb framebuffer linear mode) so a fully 
accelerated console driver in user space can take over later on?

Sounds interesting!
