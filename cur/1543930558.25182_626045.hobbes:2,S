Issuing the command hwclock --systohc and sometimes at boot --hctosys causes
my machine to freeze.
The reason is there is a problem loading rtc-cmos. I will say that my
machine also runs Windows, and it detects the device fine as a Real Time
Clock/CMOS driver at io range 0070-0071. According to /proc/ioports rtc is
probed at 0070-0077.
During boot we get the following when attempting to modprobe rtc-cmos:
root@excalibur:/usr/src/linux-2.6# dmesg|grep rtc
drivers/rtc/hctosys.c: unable to open rtc device (rtc0)
rtc_cmos 00:09: i/o registers already in use
rtc_cmos: probe of 00:09 failed with error -16
root@excalibur:/usr/src/linux-2.6#
this has happened with the stock kernel that came with my distribution, as
well.
Apparently you can only use 0070-0071 for my rtc? how can I get the device
to work?
here is /proc/interrupts:
