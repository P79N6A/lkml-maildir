Please CC: usb patches to the usb maintainer, it makes it a bit hard for
him to apply them otherwise :)

No, please, if you are going to convert anything like this, use the
dev_dbg(), dev_warn(), and assorted macros instead.  Or if nothing else,
the usb subsystem has it's own dbg(), err() and warn() macros that
should be gotten rid of, but that's a lot of changes...
These comments pretty much go for all of your patches in this series,
please rework them all.
thanks,
