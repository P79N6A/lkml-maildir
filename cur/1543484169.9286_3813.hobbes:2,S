Nothing to add to what Alan said, except that you can tune it globally
with the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syn_retries sysctl. It defines how often
the initial SYN is retransmitted before giving up. The delay is defined
with an exponential backup starting with the initial retransmit delay 
of 3s (so you can do the math)
