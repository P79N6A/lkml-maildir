Are you perhaps looking at an older copy of the GFS2 code? We set it (or
clear it) in bmap.c:gfs2_block_map() as appropriate. It also seems to be
cleared when we release buffers (which may or may not be actually
required. I suspect not, but its harmless anyway). There is only one
test that I can find for it which is in bmap.c:gfs2_extent_map() where
its value is then later ignored in the only caller relevant to "normal"
files, which is ops_vm.c:alloc_page_backing(). So I think you should be
quite safe to clear it in commit_write().
Steve.
