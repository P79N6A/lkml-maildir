Thanks for that.
It's been pointed out to me that there is no problem with 2.0 kernels.
(As I said, I only observed it on 2.2.9, and just eyeballed the source
for 2.0, but not closely enough!)
This is because in 2.0, sys_read itself checks for count <= 0,
whereas in 2.2.9 it doesn't.
Out of curiosity, why was that check removed from sys_read, which
seems the natural place for it?
(And how does one answer questions like that? Is there, somewhere, a
ChangeLog file for Linux?)
Julian.
