hm, spose so.

Is a rare case, so there's no perfomance issue here.
I do prefer the idea of simply keeping other threads of control out of the
page until this thread has finished playing with its buffers.
(The buffer-ring walk we have in there is racy against page reclaim, too. 
If only the first buffer is dirty, we inspect the other buffers after
PageWriteback has potentially cleared.)

Well.  Most code in there uses the ->b_this_page walk.
