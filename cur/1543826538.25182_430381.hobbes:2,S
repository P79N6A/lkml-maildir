I saw Andrews replay and said, WTF I already fixed that. But then
noticed that it wasn't refreshed.
As for eio, could be.  This was part of my whole misroute thing which I
didn't have time to get to deep in.  I'm leaving today, where I won't
have any computers or Internet til next Wednesday or Thursday, so I'm
not going to be able to work on this further till then.
