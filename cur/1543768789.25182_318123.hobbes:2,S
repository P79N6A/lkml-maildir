Hi Jakub,
    Thanks for your reply. I actually went ahead after getting your
mail and coded up a small program to check the stack limit
deliberately. The program is shown inline.
#include <stdio.h>
#define BUF_SIZE 1024000
void recurse(int n){
	char ch[BUF_SIZE];
	if(n<=0)
		return;
	else
		recurse(n-1);
}
int main(argc, argv)
	int argc;
	char **argv;
{
	if(argc!=2){
		printf("Usage: %s <n (megabytes)>\n", argv[0]);
		return 1;
	}
	printf("Checking for %dMB\n", atoi(argv[1]));
	recurse(atoi(argv[1]));
}
Its a fairly crude way to find out the actual stack limit. Basically,
the resurse function recurses each time allocating ~1MB of space on
the stack. The program segfaults exactly at the ulimit -s value of
stack size on both linux and freebsd. So it does seem that the ulimit
-s is the value of stack limit used on FreeBSD.
