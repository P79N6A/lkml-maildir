Hi all,
ext3-0.0.2e has been uploaded to
	
ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/sct/fs/jfs/ext3-0.0.2e.tar.gz
This release fixes a few problems seen on rare occasions, plus one
much more serious crash-on-unmount.  It includes patches for both
2.2.17pre9, and the current Red Hat 2.2.16-3 errata kernel.
It also includes "orphan-list" code based on an implementation by
Andreas Dilger, for cleaning up inodes which have been unlinked but
are still held open by a process --- such inodes need to be deleted
properly on a crash.
The full list of changes is below.
I will now be starting to merge in a substantial amount of newer code,
including the new error-handling infrastructure for ext3 and the
metadata-only journaling.  The plan is to keep this 0.0.2e release as
a 0.1 stable branch for those relying on ext3 while the new code is
being merged in.
Thanks to all who have helped with the testing of 0.0.2d so far.
Cheers,
 Stephen

Changes in this release
-----------------------
in 0.0.2e:
Port forward to current (2.2.17pre9, and Red Hat errata 2.2.16-3)
kernels
Merge in a number of ext2 fixes from 2.2.15+:
 * NFS versioning 
 * Set directory type information correctly on sockets
Fix a number of buffer leaks in recovery (prevents set_blocksize errors
on mounting filesystems)
sync(2) waits for current transactions correctly
Set the superblock s_dirt flag on all transaction completions
Fixed the order of asserts and buffer writes in fs/buffer.c: this was
causing false assertion failures on Mylex raid controllers
Delete the filesystem commit timer on unmount in all cases
Include Andreas Dilger's implementation of the "orphan list" code:
  The orphan list maintains an on-disk list of inodes needing cleaned up
  on recovery, including:
  * Deletion of unlinked, but still opened, files after a reboot;
  * Completion after recovery of truncates which were in progress but 
    which had to be split across a transaction boundary
