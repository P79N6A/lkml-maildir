Just noticed something weird when I tried to minicom into the office to run 
a job yesterday morning.
It seems that 2.2.18 (without the PCI_CONFIG in serial.c) works fine, with 
respect to flow control in minicom, everything looks great.  (and the dmesg 
shows the serial ports without any extra flags.  PLAIN VANILLA!), but under 
2.4.0, all the extended stuff is turned on by PCI_CONFIG, and characters 
are being dropped!
Anyone else experiencing this?
peace
Mike
