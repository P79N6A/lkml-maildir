That depends on what "uniquely identified" actually means.
One possible definition is that at any time, a particular path maps to a 
single unique st_ino/st_dev tuple.
The other possibility (and this is what you seem to be advocating) is 
that a st_ino/st_dev tuple always maps to the same file over the entire 
runtime of the system.
This second possibility seems easily disproved.  If you delete and 
recreate files on a filesystem (assuming nobody has open files in the 
filesystem), at some point a new file will end up with the same inode as 
an old (deleted) file.  The two files are different, but have the same 
st_ino/st_dev tuple.
This leaves the first possibility as the only choice...
