I hear you, but these changes were easy enough to adapt to.

Well, in this specific case an alternate solution was proposed that
would have solved any of the potential problems pointed out.

Fair enough.

My primary concern is compatibility with those kernels that do not use
kbuild or a different version of it. Ideally, one would want to use
the same build system for all possible kernel versions rather than use
Makefiles that attempt to pick the best choice. I guess I'm convinced
that the latter is the "best" solution to dealing with this problem at
this point, and I can live with that.
What's the most reliable way to tell if kbuild is available, and what
differences among kbuild versions will one have to look out for?

I don't see any problems with kbuild, I was referring to vermagic.c.
