You may have a point.  I don't know what the demographics of Linux
kernel developers looks like these days.

Shoot, companies supporting Linux can take care of themselves.  They
can move from supporting 2.2.x to supporting 2.4.x whenever they
please.  The invisible hand[1] will keep them honest and diligent.

Well, think in terms of whose ends it serves.  In other words look from 
Linus's perspective.  He wants a stable kernel (don't we all?) and
always needs help squashing bugs before a release.  *He* isn't the one
developing kewl new features at that time.  From his point of view it
makes perfect sense to encourage people to work on the frozen branch.
I agree with Linus in wanting a stable kernel more than a featureful
kernel.  People actually *writing* the new features may have a
different set of priorities....
Remember, the kernel is fully open source.  If you *really* want to
jump the gun and get a new kernel release cycle going, you are
perfectly free to release your *own* series of kernels, incorporating
the latest and greatest from around the world.  It's been done before.
Of course, you have to acquire enough credibility for people to take
your patch series seriously.  (Andrea gets away with it, Alan gets away 
with it, individual arch maintainers get away with it.  You or I might
have more trouble.)

As I said, it's a conscious decision on Linus's part.  As such, your
arguments are unlikely to change it, since it's obviously something
he's thought about.
We seem to understand each other.  I am more than willing to drop the
thread, if you are.
