That's what I thoguht too -- but Steven tried making the pool 1/4th the
size and it still failed.  OTOH, he tried 2.5.27-rmap, which uses the
*same mempool patch* and he had no problem with the monster 128KB 
allocation.  Maybe it was all luck. :)  I can't yet see anything in the 
slablru patch that has anything to do with it...
On another note -- Steven did point out that the slablru patch has a
patchbug with regards to dquot.c.  I think this error is also in Ed's 
June 5th patch (at least as posted), and I didn't catch it.  
I believe that:
shrink_dqcache_memory(int priority, unsigned int gfp_mask)
	needs to be 
age_dqcache_memory(kmem_cache_t *cachep, int entries, int gfp_mask)
in dquot.c.  It'll be tested and fixed on the next go. :)
Best regards,
