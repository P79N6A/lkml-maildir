Hi there, 
What happened to the patch discribed in: 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0412.1/0185.html
The patch only worked particularly, there are still some ioctl errors
when running 32bit games like vendetta on x86_64:
ioctl32(vendetta:29822): Unknown cmd fd(6) cmd(80806a13){00}
arg(08301694) on /dev/input/js0
But the game is fully playable. I would really like to see that patch
in the vanilla kernel.
Regards
Andreas Pokorny
