Heh. tell you what, though - scared me witless when the machine *wouldnt
not* boot afterwards (it didnt lock, I just rebooted and it never
posted... I had to remove power AND short the CMOS before it
recovered... most boards you only need to short the CMOS - silly
design this one ;-)
Shant be trying that again in a hurry.
The binary module seems pretty straightforward. I might see if I can use
it as an excuse to learn X86 assembler (shudder), but I have some other
projects to do first. perhaps if no-ones done it by then I'll have a go.
