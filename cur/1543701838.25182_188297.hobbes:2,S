Which burden? The kthread is a resource and a "struct kthread" is an 
handle to the resource. You create the resource (kthread_create()), you 
control the resource (kthread_start()) and you free the resource 
(kthread_stop()). To me it's simple and clean and does not require hacks 
like taking owerships of tasks and using SIGCLD/waitpid to communicate. 
Anyway, that's your baby and you'll take your choice.
