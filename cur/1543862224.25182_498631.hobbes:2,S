Hello All,
There are 2 cases:-
#1 Intel Pentium 4 Workstation with HyperThreading
Since kernel takes HT as 2 processors, I did say in KConfig as:
CONFIG_SMP= y
CONFIG_NR_CPUS=2
CONFIG_SCHED_MC=not set
CONFIG_MPENTIUM4=y (Or should I say CONFIG_X86_PC=y)
CONFIG_SCHED_SMT=y
CONFIG_SCHED_MC=not set
RESOURCES_64BIT=not set
HOTPLUG_CPU=not set
Pl correct me if am wrong.
#2 Intel Core2Duo Processor - Laptop
CONFIG_SMP= y
CONFIG_NR_CPUS=4 ??
CONFIG_SCHED_MC=y
CONFIG_X86_PC=y ?  (if wrong, what should I set for Xeon QuadCore)
CONFIG_SCHED_SMT=not set
CONFIG_SCHED_MC=y
RESOURCES_64BIT=not set
HOTPLUG_CPU=not set
I didn't start this yet (still with Mac, will install in weekend), is
this correct one?
[OT] I don't know if I can ask about a suggested distro here or not?
Anyway, me read that Fedore & Yellow Dog suits well for this?
Thanks,
~Akula2
