First i must thanks all effort in usbatm development.
IMHO New fatures to a driver that works well and can block the use, 
especially if it can disable internet access and the problem is know,
MUST be disabled by default or provide a mechanism to disable it.
I'm a rare user with routed IP and this patch blocks the normal use of internet
I dont understand how this patch can be accepted for a stable release without 
any kind of disable mechanism.
Yeah, i know that atmarp is buggy, but before speedtouch driver and atm works well during months.
Best Regards.
Juampe.
