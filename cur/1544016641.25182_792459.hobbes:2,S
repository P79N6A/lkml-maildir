The /dev/mem_notify patch allowed polling on a system-wide scale for low 
memory conditions so that userspace could respond appropriately: either by 
droping caches, as you mentioned, or sending a signal.  That signal could 
quite possibily be SIGKILL for no better reason than preempting what the 
kernel oom killer would do.
I think this should be completely seperate from the oom killer, which has 
always been a "last resort" to situations where the kernel is completely 
out of memory for a task.
If /dev/mem_notify existed in a cgroup form so that different handlers 
could be responsible for an aggregate of tasks, I think this addresses 
your concerns.  That might require some cleverness in the cgroup 
filesystem code if this would introduce device files, but there are 
probably future use cases for that, as well.
