folx,
perhaps i was insufficiently clear.

hardware optimizations can be standardized.  in fact, when they are, it is 
substantially easier to implement to them.
my assumption (perhaps incorrect) is that some core set of functionality 
is necessary for a card to support zero-copy receives (in particular, the 
ability to register cookies of expected data flows and the memory location 
to which they are to be sent).  what 'existing standard' is this 
kernel<->api a standardization of?

so if we wrote and distributed firmware for alteon acenics that supported
this today, you would be willing to incorporate the new system calls into
the networking code (along with the new firmware for the card, provided we
could talk jes into accepting the changes, assuming he's still the 
maintainer of the driver)?  that's great.

thanks for your feedback.
