Isn't it always like that? :)

That would be the point, yes. Whether it's worth it depends on how many
programs are using sg and not SG_IO that we care about.

The bug wants fixing too, of course. I'm betting it's time spent in
the ide interrupt handler that's killing it. So it can be made a little
better, but not a lot. non-dma ripping is always going to pull you down.
Even if you didn't have problems, you'd spend 80% of the cpu time
getting data off the drive leaving only 20% for encoding + the rest. If
you get the dma path going, it'll basically leave the system idle when
ripping (1-2% sys or something like that, in the noise almost).
