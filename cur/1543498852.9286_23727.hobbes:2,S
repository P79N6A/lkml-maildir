I am now building it, and due to a bug in my private build script
which deleted .config I noticed that two Makefiles
	drivers/scsi/Makefile
	drivers/fc4/Makefile
include it directly (include ../../.config).
Other Makefiles do not do this since the top level already includes it.
Should the above two Makefiles be cleaned? This will better separate the
configuration system from the build process.
