There's something wrong with the .config you've sent.  When I put it into a
2.6.17-rc1-mm3 tree and do `make oldconfig' there are a huge number of
promptings and CONFIG_PCI_MSI ends up getting disabled, so
drivers/pci/msi-apic.c won't be compiled anyway.
So I think you need to send the real .config, please.
