One data point: My machine is now up for slightly more than a day (mostly
idle, personal workstation). pids have rolled over at least once, and are
now in the 400's. No compiling the kernel or anything like that which will
boost the numbers. AFAIKS, when the system starts up in X (Gnome), it has
run some 6000 processes already (that will take some 20s here)
