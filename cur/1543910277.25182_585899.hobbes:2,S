You disabled uevents which breaks udev and HAL setups, because we can't
track the existence of the devices, You can't just disable device events
to disable module loading. Uevents have are by far not only about module
loading.

It has. Disabling uevents to control module loading is just the totally
wrong thing to do. Uevents are there to let userspace know that a device
exists. Only the existence of MODALIAS and the "modalias" file controls
module loading, not the enabling and disabling of uevents, which is a
completely broken hack.
My patch fixes tons of issues, and that is "technical basis" enough. It
makes platform play nice with userspace, by behaving like the rest of 
the kernel.
Userspace udev/HAL relies entirely on uevents, for hot- and for
coldplug. Coldplug is done by writing "add" to all "uevent" files during
early boot, that does not work anymore with platform, and needs to be
fixed.

So where are the 100's of drivers that send an uevent? I'll go and fix them.

Wrong, the whole model is the other way around. MODALIAS does not tie
other drivers to a device. A driver matches on a device, and the ds1742
driver triggers on the existence of a platform driver. The alias strings
don't "treat" anything.
The whole kernel works that way, a lot of drivers get loaded by matching
on "dmi:*" or "acpi:*" strings by not letting the driver be a dmi driver
or acpi driver.
Please stop doing adding weird hacks to the kernel to fit your personal
taste and breaking all assumptions existing tools rely on. Fix the stuff
you broke and enable uevent for _all_ devices again. And let userspace
make the decision what to do with the event, like all other subsystems
in the kernel do.
Thanks,
Kay
