I'm afraid that we'll get big storm of complains "swsusp does not
work after merge from -mm tree", "switch to shutdown method", "oh, it
works now". I assume it works in less than 30% of cases... it really
should not be default.
Oh and "firmware" suspend should never ever be autoselected -- it
needs completely different suspend partition layout which is
mainboard-specific....
