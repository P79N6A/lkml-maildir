gcc kindly pointed me at jffs_create() with this warning : 
fs/jffs/inode-v23.c:1279: warning: `inode' might be used uninitialized
in this function
And looking at the function :
static int
jffs_create(struct inode *dir, struct dentry *dentry, int mode,
                struct nameidata *nd)
{
        struct jffs_raw_inode raw_inode;
        struct jffs_control *c;
        struct jffs_node *node;
        struct jffs_file *dir_f; /* JFFS representation of the directory.  */
        struct inode *inode;
        int err;
        truncate_inode_pages(&inode->i_data, 0);
...
I think it is correct. How on earth is that call to
truncate_inode_pages() going to avoid blowing up? inode has not yet
been initialized... Looks like a bug to me.
Unfortunately I don't know anything about this code, so I haven't
attempted to fix it.
