Hi,
Here a few patches to cleanup and fix a few things in the hrtimer. It's 
mainly aimed at keeping older hardware working reasonably, especially the
get_time() call can be rather expensive, so let's try to avoid it where 
possible.
This is the minimum amount of patches I'd like to see for 2.6.16. There a 
few other cleanups possible, but that can be done later.
bye, Roman
