Can you actually detail this thing a bit more? I'm a FC4 user myself, and 
I'm sure as hell running X too. And that's not even a special X install 
like I used to have, it's bog-standard FC4 afaik.
And I'm definitely running -rc7 (well, not exactly, it's my current git 
tree, so it's -rc7+patches).
So whatever breakage is there, I'd love to know more. It's not entirely 
obvious.
