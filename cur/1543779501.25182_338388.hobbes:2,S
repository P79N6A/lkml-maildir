Probably the hardware doesn't want you to set it, similar to what I 
describe in the following:

This message means that it couldn't set the cacheline size at all.  Most 
likely it is either zero, or hardcoded in the silicon.  Has very little 
to do with the platform, and more to do with the device.

Too big is far better than too small.
