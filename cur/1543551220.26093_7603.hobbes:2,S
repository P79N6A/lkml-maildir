I was installing a Debian package from a cdrom when...
hdc: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdc: DMA disabled
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
ATAPI device hdc:
Error: Unit attention -- (Sense key=0x06)
Power on, reset or hardware reset occurred -- (asc=0x29, ascq=0x00)
After that the package was installed correctly, I suppose.
What's happened? Hardware failture?
