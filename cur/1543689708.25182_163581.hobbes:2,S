Absolutely.  It's quite common for me to receive a series of emails, all 
patches, where each successive patch has a dependency on the preceding 
one.  Linus just applies a patch series from Al Viro today which was 
presented as
	[PATCH] large dev_t - second series (1/15)
	[PATCH] large dev_t - second series (2/15)
			...
	[PATCH] large dev_t - second series (15/15)
Many of us have patch-applying scripts, which can apply an entire mbox 
full of patches.  The email subject lines, the patch, and any text you 
wrote in the email are all commited to the BitKeeper repository as a 
single changeset.

Correct, proper ACPI tables on VIA will avoid this problem.
