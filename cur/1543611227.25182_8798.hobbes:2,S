Well, I have another impression. Look at this code from ip_queue_xmit2:
        if (skb_headroom(skb) < dev->hard_header_len && dev->hard_header) {
                struct sk_buff *skb2;
                skb2 = skb_realloc_headroom(skb, (dev->hard_header_len + 15) &
~15);
                kfree_skb(skb);  
                if (skb2 == NULL)
                        return -ENOMEM;
                if (sk)
                        skb_set_owner_w(skb2, sk);
                skb = skb2;
                iph = skb->nh.iph;
        }
What you see here is that the original author obviously thought it may be
possible that sk is NULL. Otherwise he would not have put the "if (sk)" in. We
believe him, that he knows what he's doing and read on.
        if (skb->len > rt->u.dst.pmtu)
                goto fragment;
        if (ip_dont_fragment(sk, &rt->u.dst))
                iph->frag_off |= __constant_htons(IP_DF);
Shit. You have it.
static inline
int ip_dont_fragment(struct sock *sk, struct dst_entry *dst)
{ 
        return (sk->protinfo.af_inet.pmtudisc == IP_PMTUDISC_DO ||
                (sk->protinfo.af_inet.pmtudisc == IP_PMTUDISC_WANT &&
                 !(dst->mxlock&(1<<RTAX_MTU))));
}
Obviously this breaks in case of sk == NULL. 
This leaves you with the following alternatives:
1) He should do 
	if (sk && ip_dont_fragment(sk, &rt->u.dst))
or
2) ip_dont_fragment is in itself broken, as it is obviously called with
sk==NULL and should handle that.
Anyway, this is a serious bug, because the code is definitely inconsistent.
ip_dont_fragment shows up 6 times in the source (according to my counting). The
safe patch would look like this:
--- ip.h-orig   Wed Nov 28 14:55:50 2001

Can you check out?
Can any ip-stack guru comment?

PS: ip_select_ident looks clean in terms of sk==NULL, BTW.
