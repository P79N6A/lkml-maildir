Ethernet uses hardware error detection. Only good packets get through.
Therefore there is nothing that a driver in the kernel could do to
recover an otherwise errored packet because the packet doesn't exist.

As stated, there is no "error correction" on ethernet. Only detection
exists. The ethernet packet consists of a sync preamble, the destination
address, the source address, a packet length, some data, then a CRC.
If the hardware CRC doesn't match, the packet is dropped by hardware.
TCP/IP and other actual network stuff goes in the "data" area.

If ethernet is being used for the optical link, it's only because such
boards are cheap and drivers exist.
An optical link, built from scratch, uses the same transceivers used
for fiber. They don't use Ethernet. Then use TAXI and/or other
self-clocking serial protocols.
A PPP link doesn't use source and destination addresses as does
Ethernet. You could make a serial driver for your IR link and
use PPP on both ends to communicate. The PPP overhead is quite
low. Your link will be as fast as the underlying hardware.
