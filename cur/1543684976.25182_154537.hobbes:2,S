But by employing the kernel's services in the shape of a blocking
syscall, all sleeps are intentional. I think what you see is interactive
apps sleep in select which is interruptible. Anyway, I'll grant you that
a true cpu hog never sleeps, but then you don't have to worry about what
happens if it were to submit IO ;)
If cc1 is doing a lot of waiting on IO, I fail to see how it should be
called a CPU hog. OK I'll stop being difficult! I understand the problem
is that its behaviour suddenly changes from IO bound to CPU hog, right?
Then it seems like the scheduler's problem is that it doesn't adapt
quickly enough to this change.
What you are doing is restricting some range so it can adapt more quickly
right? So you still have the problem in the cases where you are not
restricting this range.
