Can oskit be worse than nachos where the OS ran outside the memory space
and cpu with only applications being inside the emulated mips processor?
Made some things much too easy to do, and other things much to hard
(like converting an address from user space to kernel space an accessing
it, which should be easy, but was hard).
I suspect most 'simple' OS teaching tools are awful.  Of course writing
a complete OS from scratch is a serious pain and makes debuging much
harder than if you can do your work on top of a working OS that can
print debug messages.
