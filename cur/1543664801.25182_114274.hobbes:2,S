Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello!
As promised, here's the patch to fix an oops in the kernel PCMCIA driver.
The patch should be applied both to 2.4 and 2.5 series.
How to reproduce the bug:
1) Compile and install HostAP (
http://hostap.epitest.fi/
) - any recent
version (CVS version is OK).
2) Insert a card supported by HostAP.
3) Remove (physically) the card.  The kernel oopses.
Explanation:
While doing a reset, HostAP used AccessConfigurationRegister request to
preserve the value of the configuration register.  The reset is triggered
by the removal of the card.
I do believe that HostAP can be improved to avoid reset if the socket
configuration has been released.  Nevertheless, oops is not a reputable
behavior when the driver merely requests a configuration register.
The pcmcia-cs driver already has a slightly different protection, but the
following patch is simpler and addresses the problem right before it
happens.
