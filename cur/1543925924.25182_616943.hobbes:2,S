Yes, plus some general cleanups in the PCI hotplug space (more
patches queued up, pending the results of this series ;)
But to use the word "just" kinda implies that this is a trivial
feature that no one really cares about, which I'm not really sure
I agree with. Slot geographical location is important for
managability folks, who want to know which slot out of 192 (on a
big HP ia64 system, e.g.) that their failing network card might
be sitting in.
And again, we (HP ia64) need to get this information from the
kernel.

Well, hopefully, the future is cleaner, rather than messier. ;)

Sorry, I'm a bit ignorant about pseries -- what kind of name does
your PCI hotplug driver give to those slots? What shows up in
/sys/bus/pci/slots/?

A split house. I have no idea how Proliants work either. :)
Thanks.
