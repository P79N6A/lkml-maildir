Yup, you're talking about PCI adapter to host scatter gather.  I was
staying within the host memory.  I was wanting to use the standard
ethernet drivers to do the transfer from the cards to the host.  Then
peek at the headers of the rx'd skbufs to set up another scatter-gather
operation to unmix the possibly out-of-order and certainly discontiguous
in host memory packets.

You're getting at DIO: get_user_pages, pci_map_sg, sg_dma_address,
sg_dma_len and friends.  I can't quite do that for this application as I
want to reorder the data in the driver and present the application with
the in-order reassembled image.  The destination buffer for the
un-mixing SG operation will be the result of get_user_pages and friends
though.
