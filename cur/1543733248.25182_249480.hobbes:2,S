We have tried it this way, of course, and it works. But the 
corresponding routes are static. In our context, all routes have to be 
dynamic (for fault tolerance and due to configuration overhead). Zebra 
and OSPFD do not support this type of route. As a consequence, this 
approach does not work for us. Anyway, iptables is the way to do it.
