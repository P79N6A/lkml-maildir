It looks like a corruption of the dcache. As such it could
theoretically be caused by any one of the filesystems, however there
have been reports of dcache corruption which seem linked to NFS. I
believe the 'rename' code to be the prime suspect, and it has
therefore been changed in the 2.2.13-prexxx series.
You can find the latest 2.2.13-pre stuff on your local ftp.kernel.org
mirror in the '/pub/linux/kernel/alan/2.2.13pre' directory.
Cheers,
