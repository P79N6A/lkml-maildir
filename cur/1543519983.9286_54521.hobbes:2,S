Just to reply to myself, 2.3.32pre2 is fine while 2.3.32pre4 exhibits this
bug.  I turned on scsi_logging, although it's not particularly revealing:
parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778) [PCSPP,TRISTATE,ECP]
parport0: irq 7 detected
parport0: cpp_daisy: aa5500ff(38)
parport0: assign_addrs: aa5500ff(38)
ppa: Version 2.03 (for Linux 2.2.x)
ppa: Found device at ID 6, Attempting to use EPP 32 bit
ppa: Found device at ID 6, Attempting to use PS/2
ppa: Communication established with ID 6 using PS/2
scsi0 : Iomega VPI0 (ppa) interface
scsi : 1 host.
scsi_do_cmd (host = 0, channel = 0 target = 0, buffer =00000000, bufflen = 0, done = c01b9550, timeout = 600, retries = 5)
command : 00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  6f  ae  
Leaving scsi_do_cmd()
