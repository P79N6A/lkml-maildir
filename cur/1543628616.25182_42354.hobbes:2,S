LTT 0.9.5 has now been released.
A very large number of enhancements have been added since 0.9.4. This
is a summary:
o S/390 port 
o SuperH port 
o MIPS port 
o Cross-platform trace reading capabilities 
o Updated RTAI support 
o User-space events (LibUserTrace) 
o Binary traces accessible through user-space library (LibLTT) 
o Visualizer enhancements 
o Dynamic modification of trace masks 
o Autoconf/autobuild build system integration 
For the full detail of the additions, see the news section of the
project's website.
Since LTT is close to 3 years old, it has become a large body of
software. To facilitate easy understanding of what LTT does and what
it doesn't, I've added a "features" description on the project's
front page: 
http://www.opersys.com/LTT/index.html#features
The list of events traced LTT had been previously documented in
some of the articles I presented about the tool. In order to
facilitate access, I've added an online version of the events
list:

As I said earlier, a 2.5.x patch is available and LTT is ready to
be integrated into the 2.5 series.
