Read the Halloween documents (again), *THINK*, then answer your own
question.
The difference between Microsoft and the open source society is: we're
different.

This 'press release' problem is only a problem because people want to
turn it into a marketing campaign. What's wrong with merely stating that
a new stable kernel version is available, that it's a major one and that
people should look at the Changes file if they wish to use it as it may
involve making (substantial?) modifications to the system? I don't think
there is a single user out there who isn't completely CERTAIN that the
long awaited new major stable version is ah and oh and absolutely
wonderful, that it contains a number of new drivers and features, that
it is faster, leaner and meaner than any of the previous versions, and
THAT SHE WANTS IT.
Marketing is about telling people that they want your product.
Good products are about not having to employ marketing.
This thread and the Microsoft's ego-inflated boast that you get to read
while Windows is installing are becoming increasingly alike (and
similarly distasteful).
