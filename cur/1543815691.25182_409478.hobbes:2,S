Hi Mark,

Good patch, thanks, I've applied it. The only change I made is:
> + * (type=5) Analog Devices evaluation boards: ADM1025, ADM103[01]
I expanded it to "ADM1025, ADM1030, ADM1031", because I think it's
important to be able to just grep chip names in the documentation files
(or source code, for that matter.)
Thanks,
