   [ I beleive you can see those thread about O_STREAMING patch. 
Not-caching was giving 10%-15% peformance boost for gcc on kernel 
compiles. Isn't that overhead? ]
   I will try to produce some benchmarktings tomorrow with different 
'mem=%dMB'. I'm afraid to confirm that it will make difference.
   But in advance: mantainance of page tables for 1GB and for 128MB of 
RAM are going to make a difference.
