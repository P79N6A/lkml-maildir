Hmmm, Jeff, the sector number in the error message is correct right:
end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 3393536
I can test that sector, destructively if needs be (its been kicked 
from raid array) - which is likely to work if the drive still has 
spare blocks and it's genuinely a media error, it can remap on write.
If i get same error trying to read that sector again and again it's a 
drive problem, right? The following command run a few times should 
trigger the same errors if its the drive, right?
 	dd seek=3393535 bs=1b count=2 if=/dev/sda3 of=/dev/null
ah, just tried it, it doesnt.. hmm.
