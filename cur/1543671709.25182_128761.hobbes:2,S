No, I've just checked - the same kernel image boots fine from a real floppy.
The CD image just gives:
Loading ...........................
Uncompressing Linux ...
Ran out of input data
--- System halted
Looking at bootsect.S, I am suprised it doesn't work, as it's done via
Int 0x13, so I can't see why it doesn't see the BIOS-emulated floppy
correctly.
