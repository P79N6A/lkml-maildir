The thing is, Western Digital has activeX apps on their site which
will do low level Disk diagnostics, which means an activeX app can also
be written to do a low level format (poorly!) or rewrite the firmware.
If root can load a module or write to /dev/kmem there is nothing to
prevent him doing anything to the hardware he feels like, driver or no
driver.  If someone gets root on a box then the "admin" did not take
proper precautions, which makes it even less likely that he set
capabilities to prevent a hostile root from "having his way."
