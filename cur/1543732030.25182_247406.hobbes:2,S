I think the intention is to have default functions set in the 
device-independent code and have the device-dependent code over-ride 
them.  Since the defaults may not always be NULL, doing a struct like 
that wouldn't really work.  I suppose we could have a struct and a 
device-independent function that copies the non-NULL pointers from the 
per-device struct.  Would that be better?

I second that!
