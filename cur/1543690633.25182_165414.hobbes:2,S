Hi Pete,

I will give it a try and if it works better I'll take it.
From your patch:

Which pt_regs are you refering to? You can always get a pointer of the
first pt_regs structure by using __KSTK_PTREGS(tsk). The first pt_regs
structure is the one that contains the saved psw/registers of the user
space process. If you want to get the pt_regs structure from the async
stack it gets ambivalent because there can be more than one pt_regs
structure on it. One for the first asynchronous interrupt and one from
a second asynchronous interrupt that hit us while the softirq is executed.
