I mispoke, the patch changed the behavior by not
calling the driver specific wait_until_sent if
the condition is true.
Original behavior:
call driver->wait_until_sent() on
timeout or true condition
(skip for signal)
Patch behavior:
call driver->wait_until_sent() only
on timeout (rc == 0)
(skip for signal or true)
By modifying the patch as described above,
the original behavior is restored.
