Sorry to be such a bore, but this is far from an improvement.
Try to resist adding flags to condition how a function behaves:
there are a million places where it's necessary or accepted, but
avoid it if you reasonably can.  And negative flags are particularly
hard to understand ("SKIP" would have been easier than "NO").
Just separate out the pgprot_val check from vma_wants_writenotify,
making that additional test in the case of do_mmap_pgoff.  Or if
you prefer, go back to how you had it before, with mprotect_fixup
making sure that that test will succeed.
In the case of page_mkclean, I see no need for vma_wants_writenotify
at all: you're overdesigning for some imaginary use of page_mkclean.
Just apply to the VM_SHARED vmas, with page_mkclean_one saying
	if (!pte_dirty(*pte) && !pte_write(*pte))
		goto unlock;
