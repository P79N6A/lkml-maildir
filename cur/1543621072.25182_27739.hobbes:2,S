Add the following:
Silly code like that:
      ide_add_setting(drive,  "bios_cyl",             
SETTING_RW,            
        ide_add_setting(drive,  "bios_sect",            
SETTING_RW,            
        ide_add_setting(drive,  "bswap",                
SETTING_READ,          
        ide_add_setting(drive,  "multcount",            id ? SETTING_RW 
: SETTIN
Can be replaced with somthing along:
struct resource_record {
} rr = {
  { asjdkasdh, asdjhasjkd, asdjhjaskd }
....
 { asdjaksd, adsjaksd, asdhjasdhasd }
}
....
for (i; i < nuofmemebers(rr); ++i )
{
    ide_add_setting(rr[i]);
}
to save you *a lot* of push stack call function and so on...
