Yes, and I also think this is not right.
But this has nothing to do with parent->signal->cmaxrss, the question
is why we lost the info.
And please note we have the same problem with xacct_add_tsk(), that
is why I think this patch is right _for now_, but see below.

Even simpler. If we never reset marxrss, we start inherit this
value from /sbin/init which is obviously wrong.
That is why I suggested to change bprm_mm_init's path to keep
mm->hiwater_xxx but only if !PF_FORKNOEXEC (and in that case
we must kill "sig->maxrss = 0" from de_thread()).
What do you think?

Ah. I forgot to mention what the code does to discuss...
> correct behavior: max(hiwater_rss, mm_rss) + signal->cmaxrss)
I disagree. This doesn't look correct to me. ->maxrss is a maximum,
we shouldn't report the sum.
> this code:        max(signal->maxrss + signal->cmaxrss, max(hiwater_rss, mm_rss))
Afaics, no. this code reports
	max(signal->cmaxrss, max(signal->maxrss, get_mm_hiwater_rss())
and this looks right to me.
But I agree, this is debateable.
