Life is not so simple, as I think we discussed when you made 
a similar comment after my man-pages-2.08 release.  Maybe the
system can be improved still.  Currently Andrew Morton is being
rather good about CCing me on patches that are likely to need
man-pages changes.  (Thanks Andrew!)

Not really -- glibc has a differnt philosophy about documentation
(less focus on historical information and less comparison
with other Unix systems, as far as I can see), and uses info(1), 
not man(1).

You're welcome.  Several people help.  More help is 
always welcome.
Cheers,
