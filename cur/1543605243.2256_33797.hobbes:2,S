Got it...but both fd_set and fd_array are not very straight forward as
other structures like struct dentry, so I didnot embedd rcu head in them
fd_set is defined as 
typedef __kernel_fd_set         fd_set; 
where as __kernel_fd_set is as in (linux/posix_types.h)
typedef struct {
        unsigned long fds_bits [__FDSET_LONGS];
} __kernel_fd_set;
so I don't think it is appropriate to add  rcu_head and others (openset, 
execset and nfds) in __kernel_fd_set. and thought rcu_fd_set could be 
appropriate name.  There is no "struct fd_array". 
I think we can combine rcu_fd_set & rcu_fd_array like this
struct def_free_files_struct_args {
	int nfds;
	struct file **array;   
	fd_set *openset;
	fd_set *execset;
	struct rcu_head rh;
};
	
or just rename them as def_free_fdarray_args and def_free_fdset_args.
We also thought of embedding rcu head in the files_struct, but that was ruled
out as we are not freeing the entire files_struct but a couple of fields in
it. So it may happen that before the callback for one files_struct is processed 
we queue another one for the same files_struct.

There is no problem in this one.
