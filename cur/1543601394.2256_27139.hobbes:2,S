Sorry, in the latest patch I folded the per-cpu context switch counter into 
per-cpu counters for other quiescent states - user mode code and idle loop
in order to save on an extra compare making a single counter :-)
So, it is not much of a user space statistics anymore.
I can put that counter back, but I think eventually it may anyway
make sense to start using per-cpu statistics counters. As a matter
of fact we are working on a framework to support these. If we do
use per-cpu statistics counters later, RCU can make use of the
per-cpu context switch statistics counter.
Thanks
Dipankar
