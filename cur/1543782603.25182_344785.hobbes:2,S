Me and my big mouth...
If there is a god he is making fun of me right now ;-)
After 53 hours and 31 minutes it crashed.
dth      pts/1        zaphod.dth.net   Wed Aug 24 09:54 - crash (2+05:31)
reboot   system boot  2.6.13-rc7       Wed Aug 24 09:51         (2+05:41)
Prior to this kernel it had been running 2.6.12-mm1 without problems:
reboot   system boot  2.6.12-mm1       Sun Aug 14 12:13 (9+21:36)
I will now compile & run rc7-git1.
This machine has serial console but only for bootpurpose (no logging
possible) Wil try and setup some telnet capture service to try and 
fetch error.
