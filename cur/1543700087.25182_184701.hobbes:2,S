Are you sure?  It looks like that invokes the BLKRASET ioctl, which
sets an entry in the read_ahead[MAJOR(dev)] array.  But the only code
that uses the read_ahead[] array is in fs/hfs/file.c, and I'm definitely
not using an hfs filesystem.
Or am I missing something else??
Thanks,
John Salmon
P.S.  The weird thing is that I tried the blockdev --setra suggestoin
and it *seemed to* improve performance.  This is why drug tests are
double-blind ... the patient (the computer) may not be susceptible to
the placebo effect, but the doctor (me) may be :-(.
