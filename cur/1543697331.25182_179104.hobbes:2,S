Those drivers (at least the ones in the kernel right now) cannot issue any
DMA from inside the firmware. They also cannot crash the system, only
themselves. Basically they are like a separate computer connected via 
a network-like connection (in this case dual ported RAM). The code
controlling the PCI bridge is open. 
You are right that if the firmware can do things like initiating DMA
transfers this is a big problem. Of course this can also happen with
hardware which has bugs in permanently burnt-in microcode or even in the
silicon itself.
