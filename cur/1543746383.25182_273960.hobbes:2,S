I don't think so. The hardware address is, well, specific to the hardware (like
Ethernet, for example). IP/TCP/UDP however is not limited to Ethernet. And
'sockaddr' clearly is something that does not deal with hardware.
>Where is struct sockaddr specified?
Somewhere in the depths of /usr/include and your linux kernel tree.
Oh yeah, be warned, glibc is a #define hell when you're looking for sockaddr
stuff.
