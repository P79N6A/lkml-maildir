My program had 3 threads:
1.  while(1) {
         sk = accept( ... ) ;
         insert sk into a socket queue
         ...
     }
2. ...
    select()
    for ( every in socket queue )
        if ( FD_SET( sk, ... ) )
            read( sk, buf, len )
    ...
3. if ( some condition match on a socket )
       close( sk )
Now I accept a new socket, such as sk = 19,
In thread 3, I detect a condition, and close(19), then I connect server
again, accept() return 19 (Now 19 is a free file slot).
But in thread2, the select() return, and read(19) return -1, errno is
"Bad file number".
It seem that after select(), thread 2 only know 19 is closed, but don't
know
a new 19 is open. ( I connect server about 1min after close a previous
socket,
so select() return 1 min after 19 is closed ).
Can any one help me !
