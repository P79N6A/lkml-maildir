<sigh>.  That's an extension, designed to make things *easier* on the
author, for example to share code between network drivers.  But I'm
more than happy to grow them on demand (you know IBM programmers,
they're always want "completeness").

I'm not interested in changing all the printks.  I'm interested in
designing the simplest regularized logging interface I can.  If it's
done right, driver authors will migrate to it because it's easier for
them, and their bug reports become clearer, and sysadmins get happier.
And even though they don't care about the eventlogging tools, all that
stuff becomes exponentially more useful as a bonus.
Rusty.
