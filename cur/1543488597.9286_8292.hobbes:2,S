Yes, on SMP machines an advantage is given for processes to stay on the
same CPU (preventing cache thrashing).  As such basically with three
processes, you get one on a one cpu, and two processes on the second
CPU.  They will CPU jump a little, but it is discouraged by the
scheduler to prevent worse overall preformance.  So you endup with one
process getting a lot more CPU time.
