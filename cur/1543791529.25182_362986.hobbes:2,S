umount -l will change contents of /proc/mounts, so waking up poll() on
that file seems to be right in this case (even if the filesystem is still
mounted internally, it is no longer accessible).

IMHO it's not spew, but real changes in the mount tree.
CLONE_NEWNS handling may really be broken (maybe mnt->mnt_namespace should
be used instead of current->namespace, but I'm not sure if it is set
correctly at this place - it is certainly wrong in detach_mnt()).

You mean mount_wait, so that only tasks which wait for changes in a
particular namespace would be woken up?  Yes, that would be better (if
namespaces are really used).

This is copied from /proc/bus/usb/devices, which has similar behavior.
