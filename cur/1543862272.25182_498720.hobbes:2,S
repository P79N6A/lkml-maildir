My point is that you can get basically ALL THE SAME GOOD BEHAVIOUR without 
having all the BAD behaviour that O_DIRECT adds.
For example, just the requirement that O_DIRECT can never create a file 
mapping, and can never interact with ftruncate would actually make 
O_DIRECT a lot more palatable to me. Together with just the requirement 
that an O_DIRECT open would literally disallow any non-O_DIRECT accesses, 
and flush the page cache entirely, would make all the aliases go away.
At that point, O_DIRECT would be a way of saying "we're going to do 
uncached accesses to this pre-allocated file". Which is a half-way 
sensible thing to do.
But what O_DIRECT does right now is _not_ really sensible, and the 
O_DIRECT propeller-heads seem to have some problem even admitting that 
there _is_ a problem, because they don't care. 
A lot of DB people seem to simply not care about security or anything 
else.anything else. I'm trying to tell you that quoting numbers is 
pointless, when simply the CORRECTNESS of O_DIRECT is very much in doubt.
I can calculate PI to a billion decimal places in my head in .1 seconds. 
If you don't care about the CORRECTNESS of the result, that is.
See? It's not about performance. It's about O_DIRECT being fundamentally 
broken as it behaves right now.
