Hmm... actually, I think the coma bug fixup stuff was yanked because it
was causing more trouble than what it was fixing. The original Pentium
fix changed around a few times too.
I agree that Cyrix uses basically get 3rd class treatment but if Cyrix
would have made things a little more sane in their chips, there wouldn't
be these problems. The RDTSC stuff and 'hidden' CpuId stuff comes to mind.
And now that Via has bought Cyrix, Via can help put more bugs into the
Jalepeno core just like VIAs chipsets. ;-)
