The equivalent fix should already be merged in now
 The missed ifdef removal happened a couple days ago as I turned on the 
previously experimental  new session establishment code (in 
fs/cifs/sess.c) and turn off the older code in fs/cifs/connect.c 
(necessary for legacy win9x lanman server support and more secure (ntlmv2) 
session establishment support).    I have a few relatively minor changes 
to make to fs/cifs/sess.c (including changing buffer allocation in a few 
places, an ntlmv2 fix for support of one server type) still.
