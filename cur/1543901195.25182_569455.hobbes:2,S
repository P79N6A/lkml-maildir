Hi all...
is there a way to reserve more than 128MB of virtual memory on a i386
machine with kernel >=2.4.27 and 1GB of RAM ?
looking in page.h I've found a
#define VMALLOC_RESERVE (128<<20)
but changing it to 
#define VMALLOC_RESERVE (256<<20)
does not solve my problem.
thanks a lot for your time,
 Paolo
