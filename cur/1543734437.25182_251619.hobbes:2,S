Great to hear. Thanks for feedback.
Not sure about the xfs one... perhaps it's related to the cfq one.

Known issue. There is a fix posted already in my ckdev directory (as 
posted by Jens Axboe). The stack dump, while annoying and causes a stall 
for a couple of seconds I believe, is harmless. Please apply the cfq2 
fix in my ckdev directory for this to go away.
