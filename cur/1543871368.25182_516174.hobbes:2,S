Finally I could get back to this but after reading the thread I figured
it might not be necessary to test this. Please let me know ASAP if you
want this patch tested as well or it'll take quite a long time (going
skiing for a week on Saturday)
In any case, I made the two xfs workqueues non-freezable and everything
on my quad powermac works again, I also couldn't detect any filesystem
correction. I wanted to adapt the BUG_ON(block IO not from suspend code)
patch from suspend2 but haven't gotten around to it yet.
