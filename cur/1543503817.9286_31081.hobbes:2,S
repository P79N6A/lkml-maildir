The problem is virtual memory overcommit - the time it takes to find a
free page can be more or less unbounded. It's still possible to make a
Linux box thrash, after all. Also, latency of page-in is a problem and all
the lazy mapping that Linux does means that faults can occur at unexpected
points and make a mess of things. Fault on the stack, for instance, and
things get a little messy.
On an unloaded system, yes, you can be clever with mlock() and pre-fault
everything before going into your critical code, but the people who are
begging for RT performance for multimedia stuff don't understand that it
means running with basically no load and giving up tons of memory and not
touching the disk, etc..
