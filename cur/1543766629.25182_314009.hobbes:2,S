Great thought, but it won't work unless you actually read them all, which I 
hope is what you're proposing.

I'm a little skeptical about the chance of fitting an 11-parameter function 
call into a generic kernel plug-in framework.  Are those the exact same 11 
parameters that God intended?
While it would be great to share a single dlm between gfs and ocfs2 - maybe 
Lustre too - my crystal ball says that that laudable goal is unlikely to be 
achieved in the near future, whereas there isn't much choice but to sort out 
a common membership framework right now.
As far as I can see, only cluster membership wants or needs a common 
framework.  And I'm not sure that any of that even needs to be in-kernel.
