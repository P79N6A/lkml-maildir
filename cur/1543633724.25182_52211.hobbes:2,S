Sorry ;-)!

This's a possible solution.

Depending by the applications. With my simulation/emulation program I need 
to create
many thread because each thread resolve/manage/compute a specific problem and
it's live depend by some factors. Each thread is create only if needed to 
avoid the
overhead. The simulation/emulation is a "merge" of many and many object, 
each object
work to resolve/manage/compute a specific problem. All the low objects are 
grouped to
resolve a specific problem and are managed by a thread controller that 
should take some
decision or doing some work. Some thread controller are grouped and managed 
by another
thread controller and so on. Do not think that I need always 400 threads 
active they are
create only if need by the controller. You must thinks this 
simulation/emulation as collection
of many and many object that should interoperate, and the model is designed 
to scale easily
on a distribuite environment.
