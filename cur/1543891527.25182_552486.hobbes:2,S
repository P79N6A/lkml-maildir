As someone mentioned in another post, I believe what is causing this problem is a combination of factors.  The triggering of the softlockup detector seems to be what pushes it over the edge.  I think I will try as suggested to change the timer for it so that it does not trigger while the card is initializing.
If you'd like to see the source, here's a link:
http://svn.digium.com/view/zaptel/trunk/wct4xxp/
I can't give you the stack trace right now, since I'm not in the office, but it begins in the vpm450_init function and goes into the Octasic API functions, in the ChannelOpen routines as well as the chip initialization routines (the ones that load the firmware.
