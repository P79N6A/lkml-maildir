At line 810 of sched.c in 2.3.3 there is the following line :
	prev->avg_slice = (this_slice*1 + prev->avg_slice*1)/2;
My question is, why multiply by 1 ?
ie what is the difference between the following two :
	prev->avg_slice = (this_slice*1 + prev->avg_slice*1)/2;
	prev->avg_slice = (this_slice + prev->avg_slice)/2;
Cheers Mof.
