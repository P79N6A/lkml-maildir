:-/ Weird. Nothing new in datasheet. Longhaul MSR seems to be OK too. 
Would be good to check if PLL really can go downto x4,0. Can You 
limit minimal CPU multiplier to 5,0 and check if is stable? If it 
is check 4,5.
Please send me below part of Your dmesg too:
CPU: After generic identify, caps: 0381b83f 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
CPU: L1 I Cache: 64K (32 bytes/line), D cache 64K (32 bytes/line)
CPU: L2 Cache: 64K (32 bytes/line)
CPU: After all inits, caps: 0381b93f 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 000000dd 00000000
"dd" is very important here.
