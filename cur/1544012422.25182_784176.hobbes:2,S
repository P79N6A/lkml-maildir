could we add some extra attribute to __weak that would have a similar 
effect? Something like __attribute__((noinline)), or something silly like 
__attribute__((deprecated)) - just to keep gcc from screwing up __weak 
functions? Perhaps adding a section attribute would have a similar effect? 
(putting weak definitions into an extra section is probably helpful 
anyway)
