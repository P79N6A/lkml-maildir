Subject: Full-duplex not working with i810_audio

I can't get full-duplex audio to work on my laptop with 2.4.17 (using
the i810_audio sound driver). I know my card (ADI 188x WDM) supports it
because it works fine with the commercial OSS. 
In the sample code:
   fd = open("/dev/dsp", O_RDWR);
   ioctl(fd, SNDCTL_DSP_SETDUPLEX, 0)
I get:
SNDCTL_DSP_SETDUPLEX: Invalid argument
Also, when using the "rec" (based on sox) utility, my kernel crashes
completely (no panic, no oops, nothing else happens).
My setup is:
Compaq Presario 1720CA
PIII mobile 1 GHz / 256 MB RAM
ATI Mobility Radeon M6 / 8 MB
ADI 188x WDM sound chip (on-board)
RedHat 7.2/2.4.17
Can anyone help me?
