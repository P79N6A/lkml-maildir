  Ok, now I'm curious about something...
  If the readw() above is needed here (it definitely fixes *something*), 
what purpose does the volatile below serve? 
io.h:122:#define writew(b,addr) (*(volatile unsigned short *) 
__io_virt(addr) = (b))X
Is this a sort of "go do this now" command to flush it from the CPU to the 
PCI bus, while the readw() makes sure its flushed out of the PCI cache?

 Another question is, if the PCI bus is caching like this, how does it 
handle adapters which write to one address and read from another for the 
same variable?  I'm guessing it flushes all writes on a read?  This is 
exactly what lanstreamer does, and I'm thinking this may have caused 
problems before.
Thanks,
