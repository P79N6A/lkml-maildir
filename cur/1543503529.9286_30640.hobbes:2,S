I was just experimenting with my Pentium 133 laptop here and decided to
see what would happen if the jiffies counter was set to roll over in about
2 minutes after reboot.  Well here are my results:
BTW this system is running 2.3.5 with pcmcia if that makes a difference.
The system did not oops on me, but after about two or so minutes of
wrapping around, things started to misbehave.  Networking went out on me
first, so I poked around a bit to see what else was broken.  Then came
another goodie, the PC speaker started buzzing and wouldn't stop, I am not
sure if this is related to the PCMCIA stuff or not, it is very well
possible. 
Has anyone else experimented with jiffies wrap around?  This might be
kind of important if we decided to raise HZ from 100 to 1024 or
whatever...
