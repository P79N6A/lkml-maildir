Ugly, really? Please ...

So, let's see. The whole things adds an unneeded (read "empty") extra 
layer of indirections over the existing file_operations. Timerfd added the 
return of the structure (because "developer may need it"), that wants 
extra compat too. Your signal code does not handle things that is supposed 
to be handling (easy to write clean code when the code does not actually 
do what is supposed to be doing), and you'll be sucking code from 
signalfd. On top of that, it returns a structure that needs compat too. 
AIO code added an extra unnecessary wrapper over AIO native calls (by 
literally calling sys_io_*). And the compat on sys_read/sys_write I 
guess will be funny to watch. So what does your code effectively adds that 
is useful in some way? Undocumented and testcase-less code?
As I see it, your code badly copies exiting one, and adds uneeded 
infrastrcture/functionality.
See, I really wouldn't care, if you'd keep the "ugly" word for yourself.
Actually, I really care only about the functionality, so I leave the whole 
ball into Andrew's hands ;)
