Subject: [PATCH] Cpuset: rcu slab cache optimization rcu_dereference comment
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Add a comment noting that unlike usual, we do not need to
guard a dereference of an rcu guarded pointer with a
call to rcu_dereference(), because we don't care if we
see out of order results.
