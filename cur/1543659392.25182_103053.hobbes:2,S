Wow, this is pretty brilliant, Jun! In cases like this one always thinks
"Why this didn't occur to me, this is so obvious..." 
(Sadly I noticed that I tend to go "round and about" sometimes instead of
direct :(
I hope this will get incorporated in the source tree.
Thanks,

The only thing you need to do is 
	processor.mpc_type = MP_PROCESSOR;
 	processor.mpc_apicid = id;
-	processor.mpc_apicver = 0x10; /* TBD: lapic version */
+	processor.mpc_apicver = GET_APIC_VERSION(apic_read(APIC_LVR));
 	processor.mpc_cpuflag = (enabled ? CPU_ENABLED : 0);
 	processor.mpc_cpuflag |= (boot_cpu ? CPU_BOOTPROCESSOR : 0);
 	processor.mpc_cpufeature = (boot_cpu_data.x86 << 8) |
