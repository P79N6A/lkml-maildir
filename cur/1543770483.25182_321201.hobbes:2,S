              Is there any restricition on using
kernel's memory? also if i require to use some kernel
memory say 625kB by allocating that in GFP_ATOMIC mode
flag, what will be the side effects on kernel memory
if i use that 625kB memory available from kernel
memory for my kernel source code additions to kernel?
I require answer with respect to 2.4 and 2.6 kernel.
