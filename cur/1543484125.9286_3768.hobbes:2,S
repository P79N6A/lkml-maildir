I see your point, and, to be consistent with the rest of my script, I should
have used arp on eth1,  with eth1 being a different ip address.

This looks like it would work.  However, my machine is some 1200 miles away
from me, and I can't afford to have the network stop working when I am
connected remotely thru said network.

The network consists of this 1 linux box, and windows terminals(don't call it
an os).
I will check into changing my setup.
