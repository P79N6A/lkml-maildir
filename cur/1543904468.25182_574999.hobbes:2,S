Boot went fine but the system got pretty unresponsive later, 2-3 seconds
delay after keypresses on an idle system and a hang during shutdown which i had to resolve by
pressing the power button (not to switch it of the hard way, but to keep it rebooting)

doesnt change anything

I tried these with the HIGH_RES_TIMERS=n, irqpoll and notsc dont change
a thing, idle=poll makes it boot normally
