a clarification: note that the current BKL is a special case. No way do
i suggest that the BKS is the proper model for any SMP implementation.
It is a narrow special-case because it wraps historic UP-only kernel
code.
our primary multiprocessing primitives are still the following 4:
lockless data structures, RCU, spinlocks and mutexes. (reverse ordered
by level of parallelism.) The BKS is basically a fifth method, a special
type of semaphore that i'd never want to be seen used by any new SMP
code. It is completely local to sched.c.
