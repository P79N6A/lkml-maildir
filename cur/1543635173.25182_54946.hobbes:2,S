This updates the vm/bdflush description to accurately reflect the
values in /proc.  The descriptions won't win any prizes, but at least
the variable table is correct.

 disk at  one  time.  A high value will mean delayed, bursty I/O, while a small
 value can lead to memory shortage when bdflush isn't woken up often enough.
 
-nrefill
--------
+interval
+--------
 
-This is  the  number  of  buffers  that  bdflush  will add to the list of free
-buffers when  refill_freelist()  is  called.  It is necessary to allocate free
-buffers beforehand,  since  the  buffers  are  often  different sizes than the
-memory pages  and some bookkeeping needs to be done beforehand. The higher the
-number, the  more  memory  will be wasted and the less often refill_freelist()
-will need to run.
+Interval specifies the time in jiffies  (clockticks) between kupdated flushes.
+The default number of jiffies per second is 100.
 
-nref_dirt
----------
+age_buffer
+----------
 
-When refill_freelist() comes across more than nref_dirt dirty buffers, it will
-wake up bdflush.
+Age_buffer specifies the  maximum time Linux waits before writing  out a dirty
+buffer to disk. The value is expressed in jiffies (clockticks) and the default
+number of jiffies  per second is 100.  Age_buffer is  the maximum age for data
+blocks.
 
-age_buffer and age_super
-------------------------
+nfract_sync and nfract_stop_bdflush
+-----------------------------------
 
-Finally, the age_buffer and age_super parameters govern the maximum time Linux
-waits before  writing  out  a  dirty buffer to disk. The value is expressed in
-jiffies (clockticks),  the  number of jiffies per second is 100. Age_buffer is
-the maximum age for data blocks, while age_super is for filesystems meta data.
+These follow the same general rules as nfract above, but values specify limits
+determining when synchronous flushing starts and flushing ends, respectively.
