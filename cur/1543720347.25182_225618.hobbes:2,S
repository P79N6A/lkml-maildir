Hi,
it is the first time I tried this scheduler with 2.6.7-rc2-mm2. A k.o 
criteria for me: Playing ut2004 it generated a lot of statics (sound 
wise). I consider this a regression in contrast to O(1). Nick's 
scheduler plays nice as well. For Nick's I have X reniced to -10. Your 
scheduler doesn't like this, as well: When plaing some tune via xmms and 
then switching to another (virtual) desktop, I get pops in the sound for 
fractions of a second. Putting X back to 0 fixes this. But I don't know 
how to "fix" ut2004 with staircase. :-(
Hth,
Prakash
