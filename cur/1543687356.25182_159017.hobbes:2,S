you can use iptables to open proto 50 and 51 to specific ip's, too:
iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p 50 -s n.n.n.n -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p 51 -s n.n.n.n -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p 51 -s n.m.n.n -j DROP
this will work. If you want netfilter to fully recognize ipsec states
you have to do it yourself, afaik there is no ipsec support for the
statefull/conntrack system.
But you are better of asking here: netfilter-devel@lists.samba.org
