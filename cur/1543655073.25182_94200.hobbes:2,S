What do you mean with "disable"?
Do you have to disable the cache entirely when you encounter the first 
pci_alloc_consistent() call, or do you disable the cache just for the 
region that is returned by pci_alloc_consistent()?
If you disable it entirely - would "before_acess_consistent_area() / 
after_access_consistent_area()" macros help to avoid that, or are there 
other problems?
