 I can only second that. Changing the default behavior in this way is
really bad.
 Not that I am disagreeing with the technical reasons, but the change
breaks working setups. And -EBUSY is not very helpful as a message
here. It does not matter that the user tools may handle the breakage
incorrect. The users (admins) had workings setups for years. And they
were obviously working "good enough".
 And one should not forget that there will be a considerable time until
"nosharecache" will trickle down into distributions.
 If the situation stays this way, quite a few people will not be able
to move beyond 2.6.22 for some time. E.g. for I am working for a
company that operates some linux "clusters" at a few german automotive
cdompanies. For certain reasons everything there is based on
automounter maps (both autofs and amd style). We have almost zero
influence on that setup. The maps are a mess - we will run into the
sharecache problem. At the same time I am trying to fight the notorious
"system turns into frozen molassis on moderate I/O load". There maybe
some interesting developements coming forth after 2.6.22. Not good :-(
 What I would like to see done for the at hand situation is:
- make "nosharecache" the default for the forseeable future
- log any attempt to mount option-inconsistent NFS filesystems to dmesh
and syslog (apparently the NFS client is able to detect them :-). Do
this regardless of the "nosharecache" option. This way admins will at
least be made aware of the situation.
- In a year or so we can talk about making the default safe. With
proper advertising.
 Just my  0.02.
Cheers
Martin
