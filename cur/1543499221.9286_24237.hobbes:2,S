Yes, screen ( ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/screen ).
Besides locking your terminal , it also allows having
multiple "screens" on the same terminal,
detaching ( you have ~10 sessions running, you detach
( screen is then terminated ), you log out , travel to
other end of world, log back to your system and reattach
all the sessions and use them as if nothing happened )
A very cool app , I use it all the time.
