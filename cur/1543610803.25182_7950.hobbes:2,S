I for one used the -pre and -pre-final naming for the v2.0.39-series,
and I'll probably use the same naming for the final pre-patch of
v2.0.40, _unless_ there's some sort of agreement on another naming 
scheme. I'd be perfectly content with using the -rc naming for the
final instead. The important thing is not the naming itself, but
consistency between the different kernel-trees.
