This is the only change I'm at all concerned about.
I'm not sure how frequent statfs operations occur in practice (I suspect
infrequently), however simply changing the existing code from "if (sbinfo)"
to "if (sbinfo->max_blocks || sbinfo->max_inodes)" would be an appropriate
remedy if there is a real problem.
That said, I'm not all that concerned about it, as my fuzzy memory
indicates it was the lock/unlock around the statistics updates which
caused the primary lock contention.
