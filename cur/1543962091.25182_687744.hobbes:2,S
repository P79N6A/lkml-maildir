To a large extent, I agree. I certainly don't want to focus solely on
code size; there's a lot more to embedded Linux than that. But it _is_
an issue. 
There are some cases where we really _do_ want to have CONFIG options,
but I agree that we should keep them to a minimum. And when we _do_ have
CONFIG options, they don't have to litter the actual code with ifdefs.
We're quite capable of having "function calls" which in some
configurations just turn out to be empty macros, etc...

He wasn't talking about one specific system. There'll be an element of
both.

Stuff like shrinking the rbtree structure by encoding the colour in the
low bits of the parent pointer, perhaps? :)

Potentially at a cost of higher boot time, which is another
commonly-cited issue for such devices.

I've never been that convinced about XIP. Flash is more expensive than
RAM, and cheap flash is NAND and not XIP-able these days anyway. The
only really convincing motivation for XIP would be the _power_ budget,
and if your power budget is _that_ tight, then often you'd be better off
with something like eCos instead of Linux anyway.

Don't worry -- we're not going to start seeing a flurry of patches
adding CONFIG options and turning Linux into #ifdef hell :)
