Its specifically ISA DMA memory

With 2.2.x the problem is definitely worse, although I've still not figured
out why. You can run your floppy driver nonDMA if you want - not ideal
but works

Thats mostly down to poor design of the sg layer (well ok to be fair it
wasnt poor design at the time but it never caught up). The 2.2.7 kernel
has scatter gather I/O on the scsi generic which is way better than before.
The sound driver allows you to ask it to keep the DMA buffers allocated
(as it did in 2.0)  (option dmabuf=1)
