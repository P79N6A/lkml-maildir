The current situation is that so many applications simply treat
filenames as arbitrary sequences of bytes.  With many encodings, this
simply happens to work, and an encoding mis-match will result in some
incorrect characters being displayed for byte values > 127.  However,
some encodings, such as UTF-8, are simply _not_ compatible with the
'you can also treat it like an arbitrary byte string model', and there
is a very real potential for security holes in bad implementations if
we go down the "it's an arbitrary byte string, but you _should_ store
UTF-8 there" route.
Maybe we should forget filename encoding altogether, and start
thinking of filenames as arbitrary sequences of _32-bit words_.
Existing applications can store their arbitrary byte sequences in the
low byte, and new calls can be added to provide Unicode-aware
userspace applications with access to the 32-bit space, which _must_
be used for UCS-4.
