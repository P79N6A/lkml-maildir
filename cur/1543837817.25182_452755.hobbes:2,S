I agree there's an issue to address here. Looking at this patch very
quickly, it breaks all the existing backlight drivers as they know about
the variables in struct backlight_properties and all their references
need to be updated e.g.: corgi_bl.c:
if (bd->props->power != FB_BLANK_UNBLANK)
intensity = 0;
if (bd->props->fb_blank != FB_BLANK_UNBLANK)
intensity = 0;
Thinking about this, ideally, struct backlight_properties would be left
containing the backlight properties in but become part of struct
backlight_device (and allocated with it). The drivers would provide a
new struct backlight_ops instead of the properties struct at present and
the function pointers would move to that structure.
Your other patches looked ok at a quick glance. I'll aim to test them
against the corgi driver over the weekend and I look at reworking this
one, unless you want beat me to it :)
Cheers,
Richard
