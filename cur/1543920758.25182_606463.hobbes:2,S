Subject: [PATCH] x86: fix kernel rebuild due to vsyscall fallout
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Fix rebuild of kernel when there is no changes.
This happened for i386.
Using make V=2 hinted that the output files were
not assigned to targets - fixed by this patch.
