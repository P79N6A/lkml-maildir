Simple brutal and to the point. Also it means a dynamic library can 
switch to real syscalls and dynamic apps will migrate fine.
One request - can we specify a namespace of the form
['vendorid'].[call]
vendorid is the wrong phrase but "some sane way of knowing whose syscall
it is" - it would be bad for andrea-aio and ben-aio to use the same names..
