Whee, an answer!

Oh?  Let me present a scenario in which I use it and then you can tell me how
better to do it.
I'm using the ethertap device (in 2.2, tun/tap in 2.4 should be similar) to pass
stuff up to userspace. I have an ethernet link.  I want the kernel to proxy arp
for the ip address assigned to the ethertap device with the mac address of the
NIC, without enabling proxy arping for any other addresses.
Currently I have been doing this by manually setting proxy arping on the NIC for
the IP address assigned to the ethertap device.  If this feature is going to be
removed, then how should I be doing this?
Thanks,
Chris
