Crap, I can't belive I left that out two times in a row...

Updated patch with MAINTAINERS, a much longer changelog entry and
Signed-off-by:
http://avr32linux.org/twiki/pub/Main/LinuxPatches/avr32-arch-4.patch
By the way, there's a separate patch #ifdef'ing out /dev/port available
from the same LinuxPatches page. Should I fold it into the avr32-arch
patch? I don't consider this a permanent solution anyway, so I made it
a separate patch in order to drop it more easily when we actually
implement port-based I/O...
Thanks,
Håvard
