no. Write-locks are unfair too, and there's no guarantee that writes are 
listened to. That's why nested read_lock() is valid, while nested 
down_read() is invalid.
Take a look at arch/i386/kernel/semaphore.c, __write_lock_failed() just 
adds back the RW_LOCK_BIAS and retries in a loop. There's no difference 
to an open-coded write_trylock loop - unless i'm missing something 
fundamental.

yes - Fedora enables most of the transparent kernel debugging options 
(slab, lock debugging) in rawhide. The current list is:
 CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL=y
 CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y
 CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB_LEAK=y
 CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES=y
 CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y
 CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP=y
 CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM=y
 CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE=y
 CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y
 CONFIG_DEBUG_FS=y
 CONFIG_DEBUG_VM=y
 CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW=y
 CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE=y
 CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA=y
 CONFIG_KEYS_DEBUG_PROC_KEYS=y
