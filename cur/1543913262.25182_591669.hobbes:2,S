I assume youe think of somehting like this which I tried earlier -
but would have been wasier if I'd have known about the mode option..
        SND_PCI_QUIRK(0x1462, 0xa422, "MSI", ALC883_TARGA_2ch_DIG),
        SND_PCI_QUIRK(0x1025, 0x006c, "Acer Aspire 9810", ALC883_ACER_ASPIRE),
        SND_PCI_QUIRK(0x1025, 0x0110, "Acer Aspire", ALC883_ACER_ASPIRE),
+       SND_PCI_QUIRK(0x1025, 0x0112, "Acer Aspire", ALC883_ACER_ASPIRE),
        SND_PCI_QUIRK(0x15d9, 0x8780, "Supermicro PDSBA", ALC883_3ST_6ch),
        SND_PCI_QUIRK(0x161f, 0x2054, "Medion laptop", ALC883_MEDION),
(Patch headers removed as patch manually editted  I appeat to got onto some on 
branch mode with git and it producing odd patches (ones with '++' at the start
 of some lines)) 
This does indeed work. I'm sorry I should have replied with this sooner, 
buts since it appeared noone was listening...
