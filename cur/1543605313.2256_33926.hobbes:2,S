I think that would give people a sense of control.

  I thing it's desirable for VM to run well on autopilot for as many
cases as possible, because Linux is going to be used by some very
non-technical users. However, it is also strong in small machines, old
PCs, embedded uses, etc. These would benefit from tuning the ratio of
swap and buffer use, and also from being able to specify having a large
available page pool, for applications which suddenly need memory which
is a large percentage of physical memory.

  If it can work well in common cases for average users, and still allow
tuning by people who have special needs, I'm all for it. I'm sure you
understand the problems with self-tuning VM as well as anyone, I just
want to suggest that for uncommon situations you provide a way for
knowledgable users to handle special situations which need info not
available to the VM otherwise.
