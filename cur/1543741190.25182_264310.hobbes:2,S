 As the defs array of struct device_paramset_def is assembled by
putting struct device_params continuosly, there shouldn't be any other
intervening data while defining the array.  So, the wrapping arguments
(struct kparam_array, struct kparam_flag) should stay out of line.
That's why they're put in different subsections.

 Because flag requires wrapping struct kparam_flag structure.  As I've
explained in another mail, wrapping structures need to be copied and
fixed up before being used.  So, the sizeof and offsetof's.

 Again, I just think it's better to be a bit rich in module/device
parameter handling and provide convenient interface as it can reduce
code in many places.  But that's me. :-)
 As this is the last mail of this series of replies, I want to add
some more stuff to discuss about.
 1. What do you think about merging bus_paramset_def, dev_paramset_def
and aux_paramset_defs into single paramset_defs array.  The only
functional difference is that, with the change, a driver should
explicitly specify the corresponding bus paramset_def and pass the
resulting paramset to the bus registration function explicitly if the
bus wants to accept its own paramset.
 I think it's better because it's simpler and more consistent, and it
gives drivers a chance to peek or mangle bus parameters as needed.
 2. What do you think about adding support for user-controllable
device - driver association?  We'll be able to tell the kernel to
'associate device A to driver B with these parameters'.  With proper
user-space programs we'll be able to have fine control over device
drivers.  Also, user-space tool will be able to set the kernel device
name as it likes from the start so discrepancies between kernel device
names and user-space device names can be removed (udev).
 What I was thinking was
- adding a sysctl variable which enables the feature and when it's
enabled the kernel stops automatically associating devices to matching
drivers.
- User space tool can write to a driver sysfs node (maybe named
attach) to attach a specific device to the driver.
- A device - driver association is represented by a child kobject of
the associated driver or device.
- Detaching can be done by deleting the file representing the
association.  Or writing to a detach sysfs file.
 As there's no kobject which represents device - driver association,
devparam currently makes a child kobject of the corresponding device
node itself (the params subdirectory).
 3. How about adding a mechanism to automatically add min, max and
default value to @Desc.  Though I'm not so sure about this one.
 Thanks a lot. :-)
