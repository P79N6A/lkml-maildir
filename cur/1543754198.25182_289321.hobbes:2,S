I'm definitely unconvinced about the possibility of bad media...
Retrying the burn process works, sometimes on first attempt,
 sometimes after tray reload, and all checksums from original
 files to the burned files are just okay. This happens with different
 discs from different brands.
So far I had *one* bad disc - that would keep the light on my
 DVD burner blinking forever until I hit the eject button, and
 made my laptop (2.6.11-rc2-bk1) DVD player barf:

Earlier FC3 kernels had another problem (that now isn't surfacing
 anymore) that I described on the cdwrite list:
