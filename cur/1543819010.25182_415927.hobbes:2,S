Can you give a more detailed answer which parts of my patch you disagree 
with?
Is the export of netlink_set_nonroot that seems to be both present and 
unused since at least kernel 2.6.0 covered by your statement?
Anything else where a removal might be OK?
I'll then send a stripped-down patch (if any non-empty subset of my 
patch is OK).
