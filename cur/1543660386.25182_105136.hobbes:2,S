Well the data I posted doesn't support that conclusion - it showed at
most two processes on the first node before moving to the next node
for 2.5.59, but for the D7 patched system, the current node was fully
loaded before putting processes on other nodes.  I've repeated this on
multiple runs and obtained similar results.

That is true, and is the only thing I've had a chance to look at.  
sched_best_cpu depends on data collected elsewhere, so my suspicion
is that it is working with bad data.  I'll try to find time this week
to look further at it.
 Actually, I expected D7 to have the

I'm interested in seeing these results.  Any chance of getting time on
a 4-node x440?
