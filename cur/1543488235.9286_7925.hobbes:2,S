I've noticed quite some message of people having problems with the new
2.2.x kernels and SMP.
I've got the same problem, random lockup happening almost once a day.
Switching back to 2.1.132 fixed my problems. There must be something
wrong in the new 2.2.x kernels concerning SMP.
I'll have a look at the diffs sometime but I'm not really into kernel
hacking, could somebody with indept knowledge have a look sometime? It
seems nobody is very active trying to fix this.
