Well, that's definitely an improvement - the original code makes no
sense at all, since it's doing a bitwise xor on two bits that are not
the same, and then uses that as a boolean value.
Your change at least makes it use the bitwise xor on properly logical
values, making the bitwise xor work as a _logical_ xor. 
Although at that point I'd just get rid of the xor, and replace it by
the "!=" operation - which is equivalent on logical ops.

The XOR operation is a valid op, if you just use it on valid values,
which the patch does seem to make it do.
I don't know whether the logic is _correct_ after that, but at least
there is some remote chance that it might make sense.
