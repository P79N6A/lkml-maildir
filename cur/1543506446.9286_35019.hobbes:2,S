This patch fixes the ramdisk wrt blocksize different than 512byte.
Currently (in 2.2.x and 2.3.x) it seems possible to change the ramdisk
blocksize changin the #define RDBLK_SIZE_BITS, but there is some small bug
(the sectors and current_nr_sectors are multiple of 512 and not of the
hardblocksize) that cause the ramdisk driver to crash using higher
blocksizes.
People who wants to use extensively ramdisks should use a blocksize of
PAGE_SIZE to avoid the fragmentation of not-freeable memory. NOTE: you
can't generate a 4k filesystem using a blocksize of 1k simply because the
buffer-size used from mke2fs must be the same used by the filesystem code
otherwise you won't read on the memory you written before (on a ramdisk
you can't emulate larger softblocksize). So to use a blocksize of 4k you
must:
	insmod rd rd_blocksize=4096
	mke2fs -b 4096 /dev/ramdisk
	mount /dev/ramdisk /mnt
then you'll avoid the fragmentation of protected buffers (really I don't
ever know if the ramdisk driver will work correctly on 2.3.14-pre2 but
that's a different issue and it has only to deal with the VM not with the
ramdisk internals that have only to set the protected bit upon lowlevel
writes).
Insmodding rd without parameters you'll use a hardblocksize of 1k and
everything will work as usual. btw currently rd.c works as usual even with
512 byte of hardblocksize because both the blockdevice layer, and ext2fs
prefer to start reading/writeing with a softblocksize of 1k (and mke2fs
generate filesystem with 1k blocksize as default). With the fixes now the
hardblocksize and the softblocksize will be both set to 1k and this looks
cleaner to me.
The last issue is with the ramdisk images: the helper function
(identify_ramdisk_image) that reads the superblock only check how many
blocks it contains but it doesn't check the blocksize of the filesystem.
So basically you must use a blocksize of 1k if you want rd_load_image to
work properly. At least now it's a know feature and the check at the end
of the patch will be done right.
