I like your patch a lot.  It suggests an additional possibility.  Maybe 
your DCACHE_SYSFS_CONNECTED flag could be used to indicate that an 
attribute is registered.  That way, after the file is unregistered (even 
if the kobject still exists) reads and writes of the attribute would 
return an error.  This isn't really necessary since opening an attribute 
takes a reference to the module owning the attribute, but it is 
conceptually attractive.
