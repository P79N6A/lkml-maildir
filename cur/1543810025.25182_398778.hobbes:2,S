Sounds like you have 2 different alsactls installed.  The ALSA default
one saves the mixer state in /etc/asound.state but lots of distros hack
it up to save the state somewhere under /var.
Use "alsactl -f" to force a restore of mixer state even if the mixer
controls have changed (distros should do this by default but don't).
