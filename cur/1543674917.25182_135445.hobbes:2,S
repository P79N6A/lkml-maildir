Hello IDE gurus,
is the following #if 0 in drivers/ide/pci/pdc202xx_old.c intentional?
What makes me worried about the code is that it looks like somebody
wanted to clean up the code for splitoff of pdc202xx_new.c and confused
the two files.
Either the code is really not needed and can be ripped out or it is
needed and was overlooked.
drivers/ide/pci/pdc202xx_old.c:719
        /*
         * software reset -  this is required because the bios
         * will set UDMA timing on if the hdd supports it. The
         * user may want to turn udma off. A bug in the pdc20262
         * is that it cannot handle a downgrade in timing from
         * UDMA to DMA. Disk accesses after issuing a set
         * feature command will result in errors. A software
         * reset leaves the timing registers intact,
         * but resets the drives.
