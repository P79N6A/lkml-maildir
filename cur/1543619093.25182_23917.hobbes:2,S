Ahh..
I had the same problem with Documentation/Configure.help, as you saw.
My solution in that case (when the issue came to a flame-fest) was to just
split up the documentation - which makes it a whole lot more maintainable
for everybody, and also makes it fairly explicit who maintains it for most
cases.
Basically, I'd really like documentation to go with the thing it
documents. This is something where the docbook stuff helped noticeably.
