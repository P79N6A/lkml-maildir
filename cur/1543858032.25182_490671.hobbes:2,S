Yes good point, and my understanding is that we go for a tickless kernel in 
2.6.21, or so.
I wonder if virtual HZ wont be sticked to a low value.
I suspect in the case HZ raises, we switch some/most uses of jiffies_32 to 
another  variable (xtime_32 or whatever), but keep the storage on 32bits...
But keeping 64bits values 'just because hardware allows us this kind of 
expenditure' seems not reasonable to me, but lazy...
