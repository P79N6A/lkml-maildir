Hmm.. You shouldn't be loading any i82365 module at all. You should load
the "yenta_socket" module. 
One of the major differences between working and non-working is that the
non-working thing doesn't have the PCI latency register set. The yenta
driver explicitly sets the latency and cache size numbers, so it reall
ylook slike you should just use that driver and it should work.
