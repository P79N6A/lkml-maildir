I'm not sure a wiki will save us, but I don't think we'd have anything to 
lose from trying. 
Whether kernel.org wants to have a wiki and the related infrastructure is 
another matter. Right now I think everything is set up so that the public 
machines are pure mirrors of the master machine, and the master machine 
doesn't allow any public interaction at all.
So the wiki would have to be a totally separate setup (probably a 
dedicated public wiki machine at "wiki.kernel.org" or something). 
IOW, I suspect it would be best set up the same way "vger.kernel.org" is, 
rather than necessarily any of the current core kernel.org machines. So 
maybe somebody can just try to set it up, and ask for the DNS magic to be 
done?
