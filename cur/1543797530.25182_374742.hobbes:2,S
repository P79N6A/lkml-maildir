Jeff,
Point of order.
My email record of this thread indicates that it was
Christoph Hellwig:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=113404894931377&w=2
who initially lowered the tone. Just to prove that was not
an aberration he followed that up with this email:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=113404957727924&w=2
and there are several others. Given Christoph's posts I
find those of Matthew Garrett and Erik Slagter pretty well
considered and I fail to see what warranted the "you feel its
best to insult people" line above.
I used to think that SCSI was the most maligned part of the
linux kernel, but that no longer seems to be the case.
Can ACPI be really that bad ...
