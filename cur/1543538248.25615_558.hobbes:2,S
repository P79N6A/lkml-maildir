Ahh, forgot about that..

Yuck! If we're gonna be hackish, we can use the # flag on d or something:
   printk(KERN_DEBUG "foo: src=%#d dst=%#d\n", &src, &dst);
Though gcc apparently thinks this is a warnable offense as well. #$#$.
If you were going to do something like the ctrl-a hack, I'd propose using 
an easily-typed control character as an alternate '%':
   printk(KERN_DEBUG "foo: src=\vi dst=\vi \n", src, dst);
\v is ASCII 11, not used for much of anything and hopefully not appearing
in any existing format strings. You now have a whole alphabet of new
format characters.
Of course, this undoes the benefit of the format checking, but when
compared to hacks like putting dynamic allocation in in_ntoa..
