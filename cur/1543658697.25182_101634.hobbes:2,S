I fail to see the point, Alan. Stephan's BIOS does exactly the
right thing: it emulates BIOS INTs which allow to read buffered
keystrokes, but it does not do SMM tricks to emulate port 0x60.
This is great, now pc_keyb.d must do detection right. It must
not loop endlessly if 0xff is returned from inb(). It's a bug.
