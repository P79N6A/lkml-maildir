   | ext2 stores short symlinks in the inode.

   | It would be possible to have it do the same for very small files, but
   | it would be of debatable benefit, I think.
   Orthogonality implies cleaner code.
The code which deals with the symlink data and generic file data are
completely different, because how the VFS needs to use symlink data is
very different from generic file data.  (For example, you never need to
mmap the information stored in a symlink.  :-)  Hence, there's no gain
due to orthogonality.
