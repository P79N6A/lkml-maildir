Because it also excludes against directory modifications, etc. Just imagine 
what "rm somefile" or "mv somefile otherfile" or "touch newfile" would do 
to the directory contents and what a concurrent readdir() would do... A 
very loud *BANG* is the only thing that springs to mind...
btw. the directory modification locking rules are written up in 
Documentation/filesystems/directory-locking by our very own VFS maintainer 
Al Viro himself... (-;
Cheers,
