I thought the speed change would be piggybacked on the next frame, same
as when 'now' == 0. Is that not the case?
	self->speed = speed;
	/* Change speed now, or just piggyback speed on frames */
	if (now) {
		/* Send down empty frame to trigger speed change */
		skb = dev_alloc_skb(0);
		if (skb)
			irlap_queue_xmit(self, skb);
	}
