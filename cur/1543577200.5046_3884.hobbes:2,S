Thanks to Neil and everyone else who helped me understand this one.
Here's my summary of what I've been told and what I've discovered:
The port 800-n is indeed the source port that is used for NFS
communications for the filesystem.  Using tcpdump, we see
communication between port 800 on the client and port 2049
on the NFS server.
The kernel source code involved for 2.2 and 2.4 is function
xprt_bindresvport in net/sunrpc/xprt.c.
I can prevent this wild UDP socket by using TCP for the mount.
This results in an established TCP connection between client
and server, e.g:
tcp        0      0 192.168.124.7:800       192.168.124.6:2049      ESTABLISHED
My only remaining question is why the UDP port needs to be bound
to any local address, any foreign address, and any foreign port
e.g. why we can't have:
udp        0      0 192.168.124.7:800            192.168.124.6:2049
instead of:
udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:800            0.0.0.0:*
This would avoid having a UDP socket that is accessible from any address/port.
