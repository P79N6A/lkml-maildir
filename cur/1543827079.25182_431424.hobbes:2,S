The same happens if we create ext4 - earlier kernels don't support that,
either.
I suppose we could call it ext4, although that wouldn't make much
difference operationally.  The developers would probably choose to generate
ext4 from the same codebase as ext3 for maintainability reasons, rather
than choosing to copy-n-modify.  We'd need to see the patches to be able to
finally make that judgement.

"continue to be added"?  afaik this is the first time this has happened,
and there's no plan to do it again.
