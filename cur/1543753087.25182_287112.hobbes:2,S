I've applied the patch, but I now get another error; this might not be related 
to raid5, however, I have tested the individual SATA disks without getting 
any errors. This only happens when combining them into a raid5 array (other 
raid levels not tested).

I have 4 250GB SATA disk combined into one raid5 volume (kernel 2.6.10), and 
this error happens after copying a few gigabytes of data into the volume and 
then trying to read them back.
