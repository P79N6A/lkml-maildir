I run the patch on 2.6.9 - it solved the problem in the common case.
Before the patch, I was unable to complete a "cvs checkout" of a
moderately large tree - would end up with undeletable directories and
lots of other weird things...  After the patch, I can run cvs checkout.
However, we still see the problem - so the patch does not solve this
completely, as you have observed as well.
Our most common situation is that a new file gets created as a symlink
pointing to itself, instead of as a regular file.
It also happens regularly, that a command (be it cvs, etags, ld or
something else) reports EINVAL when attempting to create/write a file.
So, status on my side is;  things still suck, but they suck less than on
vanilla 2.6.9
