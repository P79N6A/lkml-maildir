Is it possible that a *very* large file (multi-gigabyte or even bigger database,
for example) would never get out of I_DIRTY_PAGES, because there's always a
few dozen just-recently dirtied pages that haven't made it out to disk yet?
Of course, getting a *consistent* backup of a file like that is quite the
challenge already, because of the high likelyhood of the file being changed
while the backup runs - that's why big sites often do a 'quiesce/snapshot/wakeup'
on a database and then backup the snapshot...
