I create a 2 disk raid 0.  I stop it and attempt to start it again and it
doesn't start.  It apparently doesn't write out the persistant super block. 
I did not reboot when i did this.  I don't have a transcript of what
happened.  I can get it later if it's needed.
Who writes the superblock anyway?  mkraid or the kernel driver?
