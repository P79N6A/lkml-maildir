I`ve timed delta("exec startx", `last io') with 64M RAM on my box.
The desktop consisted of wmaker, several xterms, devhelp (gnome2 app) and
several (3-4) wmaker applets, with devhelp being the hoggiest hog.
I also hade several services in the background, but they`re mostly irrelevant,
due to inactivity.
The discovery was that 2.6.0-test9 was about 1.5x slower to reach the `noio'
state than 2.4.20-pre9.
And no, i don`t use ide on my desktop, so no dma issues there ;-)
