You have an embedded system, which is short of RAM. You choose - you can put
this in the bootloader where it gets dropped on booting, or you can put it in
the kernel where it takes up non-pageable RAM all the time. I know which I'd 
choose.
If that's not a simple enough choice for you, factor in some other discussions 
that have shown up on this list recently...
What I'd like to see in the long term is for the kernel to lose the distinction
between compiling drivers as a module and statically linking them. 
I'd also like to remove the large amounts of driver-specific code/tables in
places like drivers/net/Space.c and init/main.c - they can be replaced with a
solution which allows drivers to be distributed as single pieces of code,
without patching the 'core' kernel.
