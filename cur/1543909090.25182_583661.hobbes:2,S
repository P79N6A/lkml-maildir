I see how it can happen, but device throttling is a solution we are
trying to complete, which main aim _is_ to remove this problem.
Lower per-device limit, so that the rest of the RAM allowed to
allocate all needed data structures in the network path.
Above example just has 1gb of ram, which should be enough for skbs, if
it is not, decrease limit to 500 mb and so on, until weighted load of
the system allows to always have a forward progress.
