erm, svk is cool and all, but it keeps a local repository mirror (not
necessarily full I suppose, but usually it is). So it's *much* heavier on
the client side than normal svn. Pays off in several ways, but just because
it keeps it's weight in the depot folder instead of the wc folder doesn't
make it ligher (unless you use several wc's I suppose).
