Yes I know there are problems, I'm just trying to make it run compile and run :)
I've been thinking about this thing a while ago, and I think I could do this:
a. Have a kernel thread which wakes up on each tick.
b. The thread just takes the first user_truct from the list, adds one tick to his
   timeslice and sends it to the back. This makes the thread giveone
   tick to each user in turn and slowly, instead of trying to give all ticks
   at the same time.
Now, I don't know too much about the locking rules, but I think I could
send a signal, semaphore o spinlock which wakes the thread from the
scheduler_tick(), and the thread could take the uidhash_lock for the update.
Also, this locking rule means I can't even read current->user->time_slice?
What if I changed the type to an atomic_int?
Greets, Antonio.
