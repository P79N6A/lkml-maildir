I have thought about this a lot tonight, and have come to the conclusion
that they are ok.
The reason is simple:
1) we do the TLB flush before we return from the
    madvise(MADV_FREE) syscall.
2) anything that accessess the pages between the start
    and end of the MADV_FREE procedure does not know in
    which order we go through the pages, so it could hit
    a page either before or after we get to processing
    it
3) because of this, we can treat any such accesses as
    happening simultaneously with the MADV_FREE and
    as illegal, aka undefined behaviour territory and
    we do not need to worry about them
4) because we flush the tlb before releasing the page
    table lock, other CPUs cannot remove this page from
    the address space - they will block on the page
    table lock before looking at this pte
