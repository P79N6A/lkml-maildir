    Cool! :)

    I can carry some tests, but if Windows does that tasks lightning
fast, Linux surely does it faster ;) I don't think, anyway, that having
a huge USB disk is a common practice when using "modest" machines.
    If you want, I can perform a couple of tests. I have a 80GB disk
that I can connect using an USB adapter and my machine is AMD Athlon XP
1900+ with 1GB of RAM, which looks pretty slow nowadays O:)
