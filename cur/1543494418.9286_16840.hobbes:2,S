All I did was reduce the memory usage by the kernel, possibly at the cost
of a tiny bit of computing time during buffer access. Nothing special or
spectacular. This definitely counts as a simple "tweak", and I was curious
about whether it gives a noticeable difference on your system.
Now, I thought you were having big swap thrashing problems. So, 2.2.7
fixed it? What were you running before?
