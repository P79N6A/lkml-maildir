Er ... it's a cosmetic change - there's no serious problem, it is just that even
if I disable lockdep, linux/lockdep.h will pull in several headers even
though they are not needed -> more useless work for compiler to do.

Note this doesn't add ifdefs, just moves them around.

Well, I don't expect this specific bit to speed compilation up in any measurable
way, but unnecessary includes do have the tendency to accumulate and lead to
slower builds ...
Is that a reason?
