Unfortunately this won't work. This was one of our first ideas we tossed
out,
but the number of MRs will not be sufficient.

We understand that the add/remove area is not as
settled in the kernel like for example f_ops ;-)
Are there already base working assumptions which are very unlikely to
change?

I'm a little confused here....
...the existing add/remove code depends on sparse mem.
Other pieces on the POWER6 version of the architecture do as well.
So we could either chose to disable add/remove if sparsemem is not there,
or disable the driver by Kconfig in this case.

I'm glad you mention this part. There are many algorithms out there to
handle this problem,
hashes/trees/... all of these trade speed for smaller memory footprint.
We based the table decission on the existing implementations of the
architecture.
Do you see such a case coming along for the next generation POWER systems?
I would guess these drastic changes would also require changes in base
kernel.
Will you provide a generic mapping system with a contiguous virtual address
space
like the ehea_bmap we can query? This would need to be a "stable" part of
the implementation,
including translation functions from kernel to nextgen_ehea_generic_bmap
like virt_to_abs.

We picked sections instead of PFNs because this keeps the ehea_bmap in a
reasonable range
on the existing systems.
But if you provide a abstract method handling exactly the problem we
mention
we'll be happy to use that and dump our private implementation.

So this seems to come down to a basic question:
New hardware seems to have a tendency to get "private MMUs",
which need private mappings from the kernel address space into a
"HW defined address space with potentially unique characteristics"
RDMA in Openfabrics with global MR is the most prominent example heading
there

We're not aware of another open source Operating system trying to address
