There are a zillion ways to accidentally destroy a file.
Ever typed ">" instead of ">>"? Ever cp'ed to the wrong destination?
Ever edited the wrong file with vi and recognized it just after the
":wq"? 
All of this just truncates the old file without unlink()ing it first.
So simple undeletion can /never/ provide by any means any protection
against accidental data loss.
Backup can, but not for the most recent data. Try shortening the
timespan between two backups (for example using LVM snapshots), that
will give you much more protection than pushing the dead horse called
"undeletion".
