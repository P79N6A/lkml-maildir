static void scsi_eh_ready_devs(struct Scsi_Host *shost,
                              struct list_head *work_q,
                              struct list_head *done_q)
{
       if (scsi_eh_bus_device_reset(shost, work_q, done_q))
               if (scsi_eh_bus_reset(shost, work_q, done_q))
                       if (scsi_eh_host_reset(work_q, done_q))
                               scsi_eh_offline_sdevs(work_q, done_q);
}
That is what i currently have, i'll try a boot with;
-               if (scsi_eh_bus_reset(shost, work_q, done_q))
+               if (!scsi_eh_bus_reset(shost, work_q, done_q))
Thanks,
