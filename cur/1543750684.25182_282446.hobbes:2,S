Roey,
Could you please try compiling a minimal kernel (no ACPI, no USB, etc)
to make sure that the changes to input system that were merged in 2.6.9
are to blame.
Also, if you could change #undef DEBUG to #define DEBUG in
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c and send me the entire dmesg output that
could help determining what is the problem. You may want to boot with
log_buf_len=131072 to capture entire dmesg. Don't forget to hit couple
of keys at the login prompt so we can see if we get them from the KBC
controller and loose them somewhere or the KBC is left in funky state.
Thanks!
