I used to compile with Os on all my kernels, but when the alignment 
settings got added to the embedded section a few kernels ago and I saw 
that they all default to 0 (no alignment) it scared me off, becouse I know 
that unaligned accesses can be extremely expensive, and I wasn't 
comfortable that I had the right info to set them for the different CPU's 
that I have.
I would really like to see Os move out of the embedded section so that it 
can be tested (and used) without having to worry about all those other 
settings. The other option would be to have all those other settings get 
good defaults (with an option to reset them to the defaults when you 
change the CPU type).
