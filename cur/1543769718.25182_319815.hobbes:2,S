Speaking of consistency, what is md's support for barriers like? Is it
safe to use write caches on the drives? (RAID1 assumed)
What if I'm using different drive models with different cache sizes
(isn't as unreasonable as it sounds as different drives may have
different margins WRT environmental influences), how does md figure what
is missing from one drive?
Is there anything short of break mirror and rebuild to guarantee
consistency until next reboot?
Documentation/md.txt is a bit lacking in these respects.
