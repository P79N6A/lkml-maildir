It should do. If you set the powerdown method to 0, it will use
machine_power_off() instead of trying to use acpi, fall back to
machine_halt() if that fails and lastly (should not be needed) a
while(1) cpu_relax() loop.

The code to poweroff those parts will be dependent on the drivers
(assuming I'm making the right calls). If it's something where swsusp
works and suspend2 doesn't, it will be because I'm doing something
wrong. If they both don't do the right thing, then it's probably the
driver.

Okay :) Just let me know if I can help.
