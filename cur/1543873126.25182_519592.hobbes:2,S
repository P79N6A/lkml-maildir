I considered that solution as well, and thought that it would then
prevent the hasbin locks from being ever validated by lockdep.
OTOH, the hashbin code is not likely to change anytime soon and is
currently validated.
Also, you will eventually push this code upstream, so I'd rather go for
that fix ;-)
Thanks for the comment.
