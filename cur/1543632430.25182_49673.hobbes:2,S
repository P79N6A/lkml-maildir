Subject: 2.4 vs 2.2 serious lockup (DMA?) problem - need hints

Dear audience.
I have a dual PII SMP system with BX chipset here and since I upgraded to 2.4
(which was because I needed support for the CMD649 IDE CHIP that is not known
 in 2.2) I am experiencing frequent hard lockups.
Although I am not a kernel wizard I have tried turning on and off various
kernel options (APM being one) and activated spinlock debugging, tried a
serial console and even LKCD but it seems the machine just gets stuck hard and
no easy debugging can be done. The probability of lockups can greatly be
reduced (but not zeroed at all) by turning off DMA on all IDE channels and
have them run in PIO mode but I suspect this not to be an IDE problem, rather
a general DMA or PCI transfer issue. Because stuff like the bt878 (TV card)
video overlay clipping seems to greatly increase the probability of a crash as
well.
Using a BX board, I would assume to be pretty much on the safe side regarding
support of the hardware and actually I am - as long as I use a 2.2 kernel.
With 2.2 the system runs rock solid for weeks and months!
Of course I have long tried obvious stuff like using 100% the same kernel
compiling options as in 2.2, leaving out the cmd649, swapping slots, retiring
one CPU and such. It still happens. Unfortunately due to some software
upgrades and my CMD649 (which I would rather not dump because the card carries
USB2 and Firewire Controllers as well!) getting back to 2.2 is not my
preferred option and thats why I am asking you for help.
For your reading pleasure I have appended various system information (bz2).
>From those files it is obvious that my system is a bit stuffed with extra
hardware - but all of it is said to be Linux compatible and runs with 2.2.
I strongly hope the attachments are not considered excessive.
Please CC if possible.
I am a bit desperate so any suggestions (wierd or not) will be greatly
appreciated.
With kind regards,
		Fionn
