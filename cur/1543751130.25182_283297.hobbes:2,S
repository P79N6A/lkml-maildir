Subject: [PATCH] FRV: provide stub asm/a.out.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/5/100

The attached patch provides a stub asm/a.out.h for the FRV arch. This
shouldn't be necessary as FRV doesn't support the AOUT binfmt, but it seems to
be required by some archs for compilation of fs/exec.c.
