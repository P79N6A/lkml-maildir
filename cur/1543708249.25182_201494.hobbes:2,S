Hmmm, I wonder if the connection tracking tables are simply never shrinking.
Can you get some kernel profiles when the problem hits?  If you don't know how
to do this, it's got to be documented somewhere and I'm sure someone can point
you at how to do it.
I bet we'll see netfilter at the top of the profiles or something like that.
