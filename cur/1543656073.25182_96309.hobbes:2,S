Isn't that what Jeff is?
No one seems to have a problem working with him.  Jeff is the
maintainer.  An "Alan Cox" buffer works great when the maintainer is
loony but Jeff is the maintainer and not a wacko.  He can work with
Donald just fine if Donald plays the game.
(And I shall add I hope he does, because Donald is a gifted hacker)
