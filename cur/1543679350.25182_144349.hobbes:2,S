Thank you for reporting this. A few others have also found this same 
problem and a patch that fixes this has been submitted to Andrew. I 
haven't had the chance yet to figure out what release of mm this fix may 
have made it into. The reason for this problem in the first place was 
that the patch which caused the problem was tested against 2.5.73 then 
applied into Andrew's 2.5.73-mm1 release. Some other changes that made 
it into 2.5.73-mm1 (in a non-nbd system that also hadn't been in 2.5.73 
yet) interacted with the nbd change in the un-expected way you've seen. 
If there are still problems you can track back to nbd please let me know.
