Yes current GFP_DMA is a mess.
But GFP_DMA32 is relatively clean and it means that same
as GFP_DMA on IA64. So ia64 could relatively painless switch
to it.
Anyways, I must admit ia64 is not my main concern. If you or Tony
don't like GFP_DMA32 then keep using GFP_DMA if you want, but just don't
complain about driver porting problems. I'm just trying to make
your lives easier (that is why i did the #define originally),
not be annoying.

I don't worry about s390 too much because the s390 driver universe
doesn't really overlap with the x86 driver universe. So whatever
semantics they have it's their own issue.
If they ever build s390s with PCI slots that can take arbitary card 
they might have an issue, but I won't worry about this.
