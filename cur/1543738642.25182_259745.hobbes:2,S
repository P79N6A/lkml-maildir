i've uploaded -T5 which should fix most of the build issues:

CONFIG_PREEMPT_REALTIME is still an experimental feature and defaults to
'n'.
-T5 will likely not fix the exit.c warnings, which, unless they are
accompanied by real crashes, should be mostly harmless. (famous last
words.) (The zombie task and self-reaping thread handling is a really
hard nut to crack, and i have nobody but me to blame for that code ...)
