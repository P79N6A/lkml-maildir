Others agreed that the real source of the create_buffers could be just
too few reserved pages in the unused_list, the unused_list is the only
"deadlock avoidance logic" designed to avoid create_buffers to deadlock,
so I really don't see why you don't listen to me and you just assume my
idea is obviously wrong while it obviously isn't. The only thing I can
do is to laugh while reading your illogical "No Comment(tm)   *grin*",
if I would take such comment serously I would just ignore the VM and
stay in other subsystem where those funny things never happens as far I
can tell, which I'm not going to do just because of your new funny "No
Comment(tm) *grin*". If for any reason you notice I somehow invite those
things to happen please let me know and I will certainly try to get
better from my part.
