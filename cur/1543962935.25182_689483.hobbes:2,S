Hello,
as of some high versions of 2.6.25-gitXX and 2.6.26-rc1, USB devices pluged
into a dock (minidock for Lenovo ThinkPad T61) are not discoverred until
I reload ehci-hcd module with already plugged device.
Also minor omnipresent bug, most of the time, I got garbage message instead of
the message "machine restart" when restarting. I think, the message is OK if
I boot up and then immediatelly restart. If I restart after some time, only
garbage is displayed (ASCII chars with value above 127 mostly).
