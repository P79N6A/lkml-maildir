Subject: Re: [PATCH x86_64] Live Patching Function on 2.6.11.7
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

For example, please think about telephone switching software.
The software does not allow to stops over 100 milliseconds at worst
case.(this depends on how many customers are using, the more customers
are using, the allowable stopping time goes to shorter.)
And the system is required over 99.999% availability, so typically, the
system is constructed as ACT-SBY high-availability clustering model.
In the case of critical error the system takeover the service process to
SBY node.
Not to descent the service availability, software fix due to bug, should
not stop the service, and live patching is very historical function in
telecoms world.
Every carrier, NEPs(Network Equipment Provider) provide/use this
function to keep network service(such as telephone) available.
This function is very essential whenever the carrier use the linux as
center of it's system.
Therefore the live patching function should not stop the target
process(service process) as possible as. the more times we stop the
target process, the service goes unavailable...
