Everyone with this problem should turn on the nmi_watchdog, as someone may
have the right circumstances to produce an oops where the others didn't.
I say that you're not serious about getting this fixed unless you're going
to do all of:
 o turn on nmi_watchdog
 o try the patches posted[1]
 o contact nvidia or your motherboard manufacturer saying you need linux
   support, and return the board if they don't. (phone, fax, email, or even
   local office if there is one)
I bought a VIA board to avoid the problems I expected from the nforce, and I
needed a system (server) that would *work* now.
[1] If you're worried about your filesystem, just boot the patched kernel in
single mode, and that will mount all of your filesystems read-only so there
will be little chance of corruption.
