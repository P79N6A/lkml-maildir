I think this patch is good up to this point.  It is mildly funny and there
would exist some people who share the same sense of humor as the above
paragraphs (I am unfortunately one of them, though).
I've only skimmed the remainder of the patch, and found there are quite a
few technical errors and deviations from standard terminologies that I do
not care to enumerate (I do not have infinite amount of time).  They make
me suspect that anybody who tries to learn from this document would be
harmed rather than helped in the longer run.
The document could be a good addition if the remainder of the patch is
replaced by a collection of links to better introductory documents that
are already available on the net, IMHO.
