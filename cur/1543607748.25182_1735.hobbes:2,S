Hi,
We have exactly the same problem with 2.4.9, 2.4.10 and 2.4.13, so
We had to switch to Intel's driver.
from 'cat /proc/pci'
  Bus  1, device   1, function  0:
    Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82557 [Ethernet Pro 100] (rev 8).
      IRQ 9.
      Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min Gnt=8.Max Lat=56.
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xff8fe000 [0xff8fefff].
      I/O at 0xdf00 [0xdf3f].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xff600000 [0xff6fffff].
It is Intel i810 motherboard with NIC onboard.
but Intel's driver (e100-1.6.22) says on boot: 
eth0: Intel(R) 82559 Fast Ethernet LAN on Motherboard
the chip is:
GD82559
L021LP51
We have this problem when nic is under high traffic.
Is there any other information that can help you to track the problem?
P.S. I can reproduce this problem any time.
