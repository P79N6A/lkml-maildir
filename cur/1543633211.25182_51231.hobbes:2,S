Stop! The reason for _some_ includes there is actually to keep some 
definitions in sync with the kernel, e.g. errno values! Stopping them 
altogether is a Really Bad Thing[tm], IMO, since it means users will have 
to get a new glibc with almost every kernel they have (don't tell me we 
don't change much!).
I'm against it.
