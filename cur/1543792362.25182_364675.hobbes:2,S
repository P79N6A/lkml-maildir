Ahh, now this is interesting.
I tried to make /proc/mdstat pollable some time ago and go howled down
as it was said to be the Wrong Thing(TM). (It was not, I hasten to
add, Al who howled me down).
I look forward to seeing the progress of this patch.
I wonder if there is any chance of attributes in sysfs being pollable
too??
