Hi,
I guess it is the student server (whatever that means) from the Faculty
of Information Technology of the Brno University of Technology in the
Czech Republic.
They give this information on the machine:
merlin
Asus P4P800-VM, Pentium 4 HT/2,6GHz, 512 MB RAM, 80 GB HDD
RedHat Linux
studentský server Linux
Also note that they list the following email-address for any problems:
linux@fit.vutbr.cz
or for information: info@fit.vutbr.cz
As to which person is behind the process on the machine, I got no clue.
Kind regards,
Martijn Kuipers
