Removing the vfsmount from struct vfs_intent sounds like a bad idea to
me. (dentry, vfsmount) pairs should be kept together; this makes it much
more obvious what's going on.
The idea of struct vfs_lookup is not a filesystem level abstraction and
information hiding mechanism, it is to be able to pass on a lookup
result to the vfs more easily. The vfsmount is definitely part of that
result. Cleaning up atomic create + open should be mostly independent of
that.
Attached are patches that introduce pathput() and pathget(). Those are
further cleanups which depend on the struct path in the nameidata /
vfs_lookup.
Thanks,
Andreas
