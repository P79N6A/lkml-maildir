This holds for down_trylocks too.
It looks like it is the spinlocks that are wrong... :-(
As most return values tend to be error returns that also
matches other code in functionallity.

It does...
I guess fixing this is too much too late?
It looks like ppc mixes the ways... from arch/ppc/lib/locks.c:46
int spin_trylock(spinlock_t *lock)
{
	if (__spin_trylock(&lock->lock))                  /* one on failure */
		return 0;				  /* zero on failure */ 
	lock->owner_cpu = smp_processor_id(); 
	lock->owner_pc = (unsigned long)__builtin_return_address(0);
	return 1;
}
BUT anyway...
 The thing I hit is not a bug in the kernel proper - it is in the preemptive 
stuff.
