The confusion is because Intel reused the name Celeron for a completely
different CPU. The original Celeron was based on a PII core, the new
Celeron is based on a PIII core. Both Celerons have the same features
as the CPU they are based on, but with less cache memory. Selecting
PIII for the new PIII based Celeron will indeed give you slightly
better performance.
