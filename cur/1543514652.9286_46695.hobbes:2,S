I've got umount from mount-2.9u-4_nfsv3_0.3, and umount -f has never
worked for me either.  With a single shell whose pwd is in the mounted
directory, I get the following error:
     umount2: Device or resource busy
     umount: /tmp/mnt: device is busy
Having said that, Red Hat 6.1's shutdown script kills programs using the
mount point, and then umounts OK, but umount -f by itself is definitely
not enough.
