   If you have two machines, it does get a little easier.
Especially if your crash and burn machine TFTP boots from your
development machine.  
I have a blazingly fast development machine, and then a slower (but fast
booting --- no SCSI with the d*mned long SCSI bus scan times) machine
which boots a tftp-booter off the floppy and then loads the kernel from
there.
That plus a serial line between the two machines for the serial console,
and you have a fairly nice kernel development environment.  The only
thing I'm missing at this point is an X-10 module so I can remotely
power cycle the crash/burn machine in case it hangs, so I don't have to
get up and walk over to it.  :-)
