Jeff, this remembers me on some discussion on LKML we had almost 
exactly 2 years ago (look for the thread starting with Message-ID 
Pine.LNX.4.02.10010251043060.5657-100000@rimbaud.xss.co.at)
Do you remember?
My opinion on this issue is still the same:
- Not only "embedded guys" symlink /etc/mtab to /proc/mounts!
   We do this for years now on our diskless workstations, because
   here our root-fs (and therefore /etc) is mounted readonly and
   so there is no way to update a _regular_ "/etc/mtab" file on
   a running system.
- /etc should contain only static configuration information.
   The table of mounted filesystems is not this kind of data.
   It's state information and should live somewhere else.
- the table of mounted filesystems is information which
   the kernel must have, anyway. Why maintain a separate
   file in userspace?
Comments?
- Andreas
