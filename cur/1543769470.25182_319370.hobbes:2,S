See

Write gathering is basically a method for improving NFSv2 writes without
any protocol changes. Later, NFSv3 introduced the more efficient concept
of "unstable" writes into the protocol (see
http://www.netapp.com/ftp/NFSv3_Rev_3.pdf
).
You can turn NFSv2 write gathering on and off using the wdelay/no_wdelay
export options ('man 5 exports')
