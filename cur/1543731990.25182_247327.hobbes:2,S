This line pretty much absolves agpgart of blame as far as I'm concerned.
I've tested agpgart on a lot of VIA chipsets quite heavily which means
I'm more inclined to believe you have a problem with the Xorg driver.
btw, unless you've patched in and enabled VIA DRI in your kernel,
agpgart shouldn't even be getting used.
