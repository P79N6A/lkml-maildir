Crashes happen.  RAM fails, CPUs fail, etc.  I don't know about
"maintainence", but maintenance doesn't fix hardware failures, and there
is no way to work around a CPU failure under Linux.  ECC RAM can help
protect you from failures there, and you can do RAID for disks and have
redundant power supplies hooked up to multiple UPSs, reducing your
chances of failure, but you cannot reduce the chance to zero.
"almost NONE" is not never and doesn't cut it.  Like you said, you don't
know about anyone else.

I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
