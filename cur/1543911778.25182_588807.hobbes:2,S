This is probably not acceptable; I doubt there's a chance in hell  
that TOMOYO will get merged as long as it has text-based-language  
parsing in the kernel.  You also have $NEW_RANDOM_ABUSE_OF_PROCFS and  
$PATH_BASED_LSM_ISSUES.  See the long flamewars on AppArmor for  
discussion on the latter.
