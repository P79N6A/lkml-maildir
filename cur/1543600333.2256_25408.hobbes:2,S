Obviously moving the spinlock behind a function call would be slower.
However, I'm not sure whether this would really hurt overall kernel
performance, for two reasons: First, I would think that the requirement to
use the lock instruction would overshadow any function call overhead.
Second, I would guess that minimization of the time the kernel spins on held
locks is much more important than whether acquiring an unheld lock takes 4
instructions or 8.
Anyways, if I ever go back for my masters degree I think modularizing SMP/UP
(and looking at the performance impact) would be an interesting thesis
project ;-)
