:-). That's the intention indeed behind the above game.
Please look at IDE patch nr 105. There is a change to the IDE parts to
include hdparm.h explicitely. The next change will be to let them
include a new header containing the definitions of ATA commands. This

declarations of the ioctl stuff will with the two structures will
remain. At this point I will throw the double underscores in front of
the uXX-es to suite you.
