That way lies featuritis, IMO.
If there were already a library in ths stock Python distribution to digest
.Xdefaults files I might consider this.  Perhaps I'll write one.  But I'm

The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept, and 
wording of the second amendment to the Constitution of the United 
States, as well as its interpretation by every major commentator and 
court in the first half-century after its ratification, indicates 
that what is protected is an individual right of a private citizen
