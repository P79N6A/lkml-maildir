No, because it violates the standard. Just as we can define a major
number to have a specific meaning, we can define a name in the devfs

Yes, it's broken if someone writes a cabbage dicer driver and uses
"cd" as the leaf node name for devfs.
Yes, it's broken if someone writes a cabbage dicer driver and uses
the same major as the IDE CD-ROM or SCSI CD-ROM drivers.
