Hi Steve,
The "3-order allocation failures" should not be a problem - its just 
the ide-scsi driver trying to allocate a big scatter-gather list of 8 pages,
it fails then tries to allocate "smaller pieces" (4 pages then if that fails 
1 page of memory). 
Now the problem is the ide-scsi timeout's -- I really have not much of 
an idea what could be going wrong there.
