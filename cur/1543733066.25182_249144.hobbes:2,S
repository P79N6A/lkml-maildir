In which case I protest in the strongest terms that having one device
node plus attributes _PER_ _LED_ is just fscking stupid.  What if you
have an embedded machine with 32 LEDs?  Do you _really_ need all that
extra data just to support sysfs so that maybe you can control them
from userspace?
What next?  One sysfs node plus attributes per GPIO line?  How about
we do one sysfs node per virtual memory bit so people can control
anything in their system on a bit granularity without needing mmap
or any other interfaces?  When does this madness stop?
It comes down to this:
 - is a single LED in one package one device?
 - is a set of two LEDs in one package one device?
 - is a set of three LEDs in one package a device?
 - what about a bank of 8 LEDs grouped together?
 - what about 4 banks of 8 LEDs grouped together?
 - what about 7 segment numeric LED displays?
 - what about 14 segment alphanumeric LED displays?
All of these are LED devices.  Does one sysfs node per individual LED
element _really_ make sense for all these cases?  I think not.
