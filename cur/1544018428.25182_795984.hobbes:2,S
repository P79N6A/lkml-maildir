Yes, a userspace oom handler must be sanely implemented.

oom_adj scores are separate from the hard-coded and very fundamental 
heuristic that we should kill a task that has memory allocated on nodes we 
are attempting to free.  Anything else would just be stupid.

No, I object against any patch that isn't a complete solution to the 
problem being presented.  It's purely a matter of good software 
engineering practices and in the interest of a long-term maintainable 
kernel.

Any sane handler for responding to oom conditions will not require 
additional memory from nodes that are under oom, whether that includes all 
system memory or a subset, if it is attached to the oom notifier.

The page allocator cannot invoke the oom killer in atomic context, so this 
would be happening in process content where it can sleep.  The userspace 
oom handler will wake up, handle the condition either by relaxing hardwall 
restrictions for either the memory controller or cpusets, or killing a 
task itself unless it chooses to defer to the kernel.

Wrong, oom conditions do not preempt task scheduling.

I'm quite certain you've spent more time writing emails to me than merging 
the patch and testing its possibilities, given your lack of understanding 
of its very basic concepts.
