On a side note, did you consider that, for that purpose, the system
you're using may be underpowered (that is, not enough CPU / Bus
speed)??
Depending on your system configuration, plus frequency and resolution
of frame acquisition, yes, it's not going to work.
Maybe using an external Wifi<>Ethernet bridge is going to lighten the
system load (those USB adapters probably do most of the work in the
host system)
I've already encountered the PCI latency problem in a similar project
(using BTTVs, the image would be missing some lines) with not so
frequent captures and two BTTVs on the system)
Just my 2c...
