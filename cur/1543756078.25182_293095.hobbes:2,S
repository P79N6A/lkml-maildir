Dear developers,
For some kernel versions (say, since 2.6.10 proper, all the 2.6.11-rc's,
some -mm trees and also -ac) I have been getting the message "irq 10:
nobody cared!".
The message says that I should pass the irqpoll option to the kernel and
even if I do, I still get the stack trace and the "irq 10: nobody cared!"
message. :-(
The message seems to be related to the Promise PDC20265 driver and it
appeared right after I moved my HDs from my motherboard's VIA controllers
to the Promise controllers. I have an Asus A7V board, with 2 VIA 686a
controllers and 2 Promise PDC20265 controllers.
I already tried enabling and disabling ACPI, but it seems that the problem
just doesn't go away. :-(
I am including the dmesg log of my system with this message. I am CC'ing
the linux-ide list, but I'm only subscribed to linux-kernel. I would
appreciate CC's, if possible.
Thank you very much for any help, Rogério.
P.S.: I am, right now, re-compiling 2.6.11-rc3-mm1 with the extra pass of
kallsyms to see if the problem persists with this release.
