Each page fault potentially calls reclamation by allocating
required page with __GFP_IO | __GFP_FS bits set. Synchronous
reclamation in page fault is really normal.

OK. What if I have a container with 100 pages limit in a 4Gb
(~ million of pages) machine and this group starts reclaiming
its pages. In case this group uses its pages heavily they will
be at the beginning of an LRU list and reclamation code would
have to scan through all (million) pages before it finds proper
ones. This is not optimal!

isolate_lru_pages() helps in this. As far as I remember this
was introduced to reduce lru lock contention and keep lru
lists integrity.
In beancounters patches this is used to shrink BC's pages.
