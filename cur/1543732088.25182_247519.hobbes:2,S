I'll actually buy into that. If only because I consider caching to be one 
of the more important things that the kernel does (caches are a _classic_ 
case of "shared data that needs synchronization").
However, that said, user space can trivially cache things in the 
filesystem, so while this may be a convenient feature, I think you should 
look at perhaps doing it in the _shell_ instead..
