I don't think so - I believe one of the problem cases is where you
have a screaming interrupt caused by an improperly setup device.
Consider the case where you have a shared interrupt line and you're
partially through resuming devices, when one unresumed device (setup
by the BIOS) suddenly starts asserting its interrupt.
The kernel then disables the source.  Unfortunately, that was the IRQ
for your USB host, which has your USB keyboard and mouse attached.
