I plan to could do 'mount -t axfs /dev/mtdblock2 /mnt/axfs' and use
the mtd to get the address to flash from map->cached or maybe
mtd->point.  Personally I think this is a clean approach to mounting
this fs.  Right now we do it like linear cramfs 'mount -t cramfs -o
physaddr=0xDEADBEEF /dev/null /mnt/axfs' and then map flash ourselves
with ioremap().  I'd like to enable a mode like this to in case you
don't have MTD.   But I prefer the former.

Haven't done any performance testing on squashfs.  I did see some
compression analysis that basically showed that squashfs did compress
better but paid for that flash saving in extra RAM.
