Don't do this. It's horrible. It makes the code much harder to read.
What's so wrong with initializing affinity on UP? It's still conceptually 
a fine thing to do, although it's obviously trivially a no-op.
Also, since it's only used in "handle.c", why not just move it there? 
Then, just make it static, and make it a no-op for the non-SMP case. Ok?
In fact, I think it already is a no-op in the UP case, and you can 
literally just do
	static inline void __init init_irq_default_affinity(void)
	{
	 	alloc_cpumask_var(&irq_default_affinity, GFP_KERNEL);
	 	cpumask_setall(irq_default_affinity);
	}
and be done with it. I think it should all compile away to nothing if 
CONFIG_SMP isn't set.
