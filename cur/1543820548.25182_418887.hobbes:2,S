Well, for what it is worth, I think that even in its first public
release in 2000, SELinux provided mediation of more operations than AA
does even now, even if we exclude network controls from consideration
(since SubDomain had some form of network controls in the past that were
temporarily dropped due to LSM limitations).

Yes, and this is the real point - it is a question of whether the
underlying model (if it can even be said to have one) generalizes.  With
SELinux, there is a well-defined model and it does generalize.  With AA,
I just don't see it.

I'd expect even more compatibility issues with AA-style access controls
than a jail/virtualization approach.

I don't know whether existing jail/virtualization solutions can fully
replicate your functionality, but be careful not to confuse the actual
requirements with your current implementation and UI.  And you have to
weigh the gains in robustness against any potential loss in
expressiveness.

Not sure what this would look like, but if your module still ends up
calling d_path or equivalent on every open, then it seems problematic
regardless.
