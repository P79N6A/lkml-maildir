The kernel is preemptible if you enable the preempt option in the 
configuration. There are some code paths that are not preemptible despite 
this, but they are gradually being improved over time.

You're thinking about the 2.4 kernel. 2.6 is effectively both of those 
patches inclusive.

If you want lower latency on a 2.4 kernel you need further patches. You are 
most likely to benefit from a move to a 2.6 kernel and enabling preempt.
