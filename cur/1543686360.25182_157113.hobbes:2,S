I'm pretty sure the problem is related to the file 
usr/initramfs_data.S. This file is automatically created by the
usr/Makefile, but not deleted by mrproper or distclean (in -test1). 
See l-k thread "remove initramfs temp files" of Aug 8.
The patch to -test2 contained the file usr/initramfs_data.S, and the
patch process fails since it's trying to create it. I ended up
accidently with garbage in usr/initramfs_data.S, to the effect that
the symbol .init.ramfs was empty (could be told from System.map),
which in turn had the effect that in init/initramfs.c the function
unpack_to_rootfs() was called with a length of 0 (&__initramfs_end ==
&__initramfs_start), which in turn prevented this very initial root
file system which is needed to mount root.
A warning message in unpack_to_rootfs() if it is called with a length
of 0 would have been very helpful.
Having make distclean remove initramfs_data.S would be very good
practice as well.
