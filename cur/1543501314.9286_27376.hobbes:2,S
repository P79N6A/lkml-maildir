I'm glad to hear that, but I don't understand how that would
work. I've heard talk about automagically tarring up directories,
accessing "default" files when opening a directory, and so on. So how
do you make this user (per process) configurable?
Especially if data filters/default opening/automagic tarring is put
into the kernel/FS, how do you make that user configurable?
