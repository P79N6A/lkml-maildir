You have to have something returned from the kernel to even attempt a WAG
on geometry........Since we do this in the kernel, why should the resolts
not be exported to USER-SPACE?  This way ALL user-space utilities are
using what the kernel declares...........
If you refer to your 20GB reporting "16383/16/63" that is correct.....
Go read the docs on
