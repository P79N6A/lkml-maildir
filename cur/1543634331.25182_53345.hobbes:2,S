There's no One Right Way to do this.  Here's my suggested feature
hierarchy:
1) Provide a "/proc" file system entry so humans can easily see your
driver's status.  It's easy to make a simple read-only "/proc" file.
2) Implement a "poll" method in your device driver that simply blocks
until one of your anomalous events occurs.  Applications can then do
a standard select(2) system call to detect these events.  Select(2)
is quite efficient.  After the select(2) returns, then a simple
read(2) could get the data.
3) Implement a "mmap" method in your device driver so that
applications could just map in a status buffer.
4) You could use signals, but these take more handshaking
infrastructure via ioctl's between the driver and applications than
do these other suggestions.
