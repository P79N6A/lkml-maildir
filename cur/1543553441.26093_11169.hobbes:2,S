I think I have the same problem with 2.4.0-test10 (with rieserfs-patch). 
With small images (initrd-ramdisk) I have no problem, but when I prepare an
ext2fs-image for a backup on CD, the system will invariably hang. For me
this is a showstopper bug. I tried to further investigate this bug. I found
it can also be triggered by running bonnie on an ext2fs-image
(filesize=200Mb). When it hung, the EIP pointed to somewhere in
default_idle. Does anybody have some hints for finding some more useful
information about this bug?
