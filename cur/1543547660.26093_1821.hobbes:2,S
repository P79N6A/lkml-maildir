Are you kidding? In nvi:
iI:Vi ^V<ESC>f:r^V
;CG/mark_buffer_dirty/^V
w%dF,:x^V<ESC>2k"a3dd@a<ESC>0"bd$
ifind . -name '*.[chS]'|xargs grep -nw mark_buffer_dirty /dev/null<ESC>!!sh
and then press @b on the obvius lines. Doing the rest by hands will not
take anywhere near 3 hours. I'm not saying that it's the most elegant way
to write such macro, but it will work (<ESC> stands for Esc and ^V for
Ctrl-V, indeed).
Translation for vi-impaired: first 3 lines enter the string
I:Vi ^[f:r^M;CG/mark_buffer_dirty/^Mw%dF,:x^[2k"ad3d@a
and move it into buffer b. The next line inserts the obvious command
and filters it through sh, giving you the list of all instances of
mark_buffer_dirty.
After that, @b would execute the macro stored in buffer b, that is
	insert ':Vi ' in the beginning of line
	find first ':' after it
	replace it with <CR>
	repeat the last search (== find next ':')
	replace it and the rest of line with
G/mark_buffer_dirty/
w%dF,:x
	[at that point you have
:Vi <file>
G<line>/mark_buffer_dirty/
w%dF,:x
	where your line was]
	go 2 lines up
	move 3 lines into buffer a
	execute macro stored in a, that is
		open a new window that would contain <file>
		go to line number <line>
		search for mark_buffer_dirty
		go to the next word (that will be'(')
		go to the corresponding ')'
		delete back to the ','
		save file and close the window
IOW, @b goes to the corresponding instance of mark_buffer_dirty and
removes the second argument. That's it.
