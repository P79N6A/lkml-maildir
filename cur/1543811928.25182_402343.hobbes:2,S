Could someone *PLEASE* produce a *unified* patch that is compatible with 
2.6.16-rc5 or 2.6.15.4 so I can reproduce the error?
Mark had two patches, I have had the most PIA time getting them to work, 
patch properly, etc..
With 2.6.16-rc5:
# make bzImage
   CHK     include/linux/version.h
scripts/kconfig/conf -s arch/i386/Kconfig
#
# using defaults found in .config
#
   SPLIT   include/linux/autoconf.h -> include/config/*
   CHK     include/linux/compile.h
   CHK     usr/initramfs_list
   GEN     .version
   CHK     include/linux/compile.h
   UPD     include/linux/compile.h
   CC      init/version.o
   LD      init/built-in.o
   LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
