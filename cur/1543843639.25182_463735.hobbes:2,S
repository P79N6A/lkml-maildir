oh, being the first mover is the hardest part. Finding the right 
solution is a hard, it is blind Brownian motion in untested waters. Once 
good solutions have been found and once they have been integrated 
upstream, an architecture 'only' has to follow straight through the 
example. (which is _still_ far from trivial, but it certainly doesnt 
take years.)
