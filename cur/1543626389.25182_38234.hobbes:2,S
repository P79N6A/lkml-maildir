This isn't really my area of expertice, but have you also recovered the original crond ? Perhaps that was compromized as well, and a replacement of the binaries are crontabbed? Search your system for copies of ls, netstat, ps, whatever. This is just a thought that hit me when I read this.
I wish you all of luck in recovering your system(s)
