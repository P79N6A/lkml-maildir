This is not always true: as Ingo pointed out, more memory
means more cache misses, and that costs CPU cycles as well.
The sometimes the reductive function could be as simple as
(x&0xFF).
The advantage of a reductive function is that - if you have a suitable
parameter - you can achieve parallel execution even without a memory
structure (e.g. cache lookup's: instead of one fully associated
cache with one lock you implement an array of 4(16,...)-way set
associate caches with one lock for each cache)

I've downloaded it yesterday, but I don't know when I'll have enough
time for a review.
