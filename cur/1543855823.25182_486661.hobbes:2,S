-----------------
For pci mem resource that size is bigger than 4G, the sz returned by
pc_size will be 0.
So that resource is skipped, and register contained hi address will be
treated as another 32bit
resource. We need to use sz64 and pci_sz64 for 64 bit resource for clear
logical.
Typical usages for this: Opteron system with co-processor and the
co-processor could take
more than 4G RAM as pre-fetchable mem resource.
