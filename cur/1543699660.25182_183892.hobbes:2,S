    I have an IBM Mpro with Intel 875p motherboard with SATA (ICH5 ) 82801EB chip on it . THe problem is this chipset is not recognised in redhat 7.3 , does not get installed ,it cannot find the neither harddrive or cdrom drives ( IDE only not SATA ) . I need it working on redhat 7.3 (2.4.18-3) . Any suggestive patch /work-around will be highly appreciated .
