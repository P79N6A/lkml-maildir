Well, hopefully you won't mount /tmp over nfs. Or if you do, it will be private
to each client machine. (i.e. server has /tmp/client<n>/)
With anon mmaps, you have to specify the size. The program may not know that.
Eg. gcc could use anonymous tempfiles to pass info between its various stages.
i.e. open the temp, attach it to stdout of cpp, run cpp, lseek back to
beginning, attach it to stdin of cc1 and attach another tempfile as handle 3
(say) for the .s output etc etc.
