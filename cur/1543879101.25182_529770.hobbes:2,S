I'm not yet decided whether I'll do the same for some future kernel, but 
even if I'll do it, that wouldn't imply an immediate dropping of the 
2.6.16 series - especially since in a "security fixes only" mode 
maintaining it would require nearly zero work.

If I'll maintain a more recent kernel series, that would be >= 2.6.22.
So if you need something in the near future that wouldn't help you.
If 2.6.16 works for you that sounds like a good option, otherwise you 
could get security support [1] by building upon some distribution kernel 
(e.g. Ubuntu 6.10 that will get security updates for the next 12 months 
ships with a 2.6.17 kernel).

[1] and that's what the "long-term maintenance" of 2.6.16 is really
    about: no regressions and security fixes
