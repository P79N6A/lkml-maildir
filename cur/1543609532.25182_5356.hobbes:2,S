Is PnPBIOS one of these? I'm wondering when(if) it'll make it in as I'd
like to get my linux operating environment as close to the windows one
due to the laptop turning off when sound modules have been loaded (after
a while). This seems to have almost vanished in my upgrade from 2.2.19
to 2.4.xacy but it still happens occasionally.
ATM I have the BIOS set for WinME (bah) and with PnPBIOS my sound card is
given the correct IRQ instead of 0.
