Hi Again,
I am writting a device driver (character, not block). User applications
communicate with it through ioctl calls. It maps our PCI cards memory
space into user space so the application can have direct access to it.
If the user applicaiton is sent a SIGABRT or SIGQUIT after it has mmap-ed
the device into its address space, the whole OS hangs. SIGKILL and SIGTERM
do not appear to have this affect. Am I supposed to do something special
in the device driver to handle these types of terminations? Whenever I
ctrl-C the user application, the release methos of the file operations
structure is called and everything packs up nicely, are the other signals
somehow different?
Regards
Greg.
