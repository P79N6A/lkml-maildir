Interestingly, doing a build with ALLYESCONFIG, ALLMODCONFIG, and 
ALLNOCONFIG doesn't catch this type of error.
I just did a copy+paste and that brought in ipv6_addr_type.  So I'm not 
convinced it's really needed here.  David, can you take a look at the 
code in svcsock.c right around the ipv6_addr_type() call and let me know 
if we can avoid that call outright?
