Ok, why instead don't we go for something like the attached patch?
We exclude sync signals from signalfd, but we don't limit signalfd to 
shared signals. Ie, we should be able to fetch a signal sent with 
sys_tkill() to threads different from "current", that otherwise we would 
not be able to fetch.
Ben, sorry but my memory sucks ... the "notifier" thing was fine in that 
case, no?
