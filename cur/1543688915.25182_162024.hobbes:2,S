I just removed TCQ from my IDE setup, and I still lock up during boot.  The
last message displayed is:
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
The numlock comes on, and then I'm locked up hard, for instance, I cannot
turn off the numlock at this point.
One thing that I would note is that I don't have anything plugged into my
PS2/2 port since I have a USB mouse.  (A Kensington Model# MOSUU B, that
works fine in 2.4.x, FWIW.)  Please advise if there is more debugging that
I can try.
Thanks,
	Dale
