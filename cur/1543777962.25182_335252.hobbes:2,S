So you use file->offset of the pseudo-directory representing the whole
union stack for two values:
1. level within the union stack we're currently at and
2. offset within the real directory at said level.
And you need a sane value for i_size at every level (but perhaps the
last) to break the converged file->offset apart into (level, offset)
again.  Right?

Yep.  Two consecutive open() on the "same file" are racy, so anything
could have happened in between.  That's a well-known proplem in
userspace.
