Yes and no.  PageLocked may just indicate a background writeback in
progress.  That definitely happens in the swap cache right now, but the
vfs code doesn't use it for the page cache (yet).  It will do.  However,
if a given filesystem provides its own write-page strategy functions
which have their own locking semantics, there's no real reason to
prevent it from doing so as long as the page mapping functions continue
to block on a non-uptodate page.

_Good_. :)
