when you install redhat linux, you can select to install the
kernel-include and kernel-source
but I think the kernel include files come with redhat7 (i am not sure
about rh6) won't let you to compile a kernel module by using
/usr/include/linux (they ask you to use /usr/src/linux-xxx)
you can dnload the kernel source from 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org
 and build you
own kernel/NIC driver.
