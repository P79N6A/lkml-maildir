Hi,
   A new version of my xconfig snapshot is available at
ftp://rudy.mif.pg.gda.pl/pub/People/ankry/linux-patches/2.2/xconfig/
as 
      patch-xconfig-990317.gz
Please test it. It contains more fixes and some new features from 
kbuild language specification.
I'm still looking for bugs that have not been fixed yet ...
Andrzej
