On my side, there is obviously no reason to keep them in 2.5, as sym-2 is
intended to replace them both. Personnaly I have switched to sym-2 on my
systems since several months.
However, I donnot consider myself as the only owner of these drivers. The
owners are all people that may need symbios chips support under Linux. My
personnal vote, as a user/owner, is to remove them and rely for symbios
chip support on sym-2.

Linux stable is a different issue. For this one, I would prefer the old
drivers to remain in place for a longer time. However, I personnaly will
not track bugs on old drivers if either,
- The problem also shows up in sym-2. Then I will try to fix sym-2,
- Or the problem simply doesn't occur in sym-2.
This will apply to problems reported directly by users or by packagers.
By the way, for now, I haven't received any report about sym-2 failing
when sym-1 or ncr succeeds, and my feeling is that this could well be very
unlikely.
But I can make mistakes, me too. :-)
  Gérard.
