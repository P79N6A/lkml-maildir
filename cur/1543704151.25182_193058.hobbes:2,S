Well, isn't it just fscking great...  So in order to send you an email
I have to
	a) cut the URL from your reply
	b) suspend mutt(1)
	c) type lynx '' and paste the damn thing in there
	d) pray that your setup doesn't use Javashit or something equally
obnoxious
That, BTW, assumes that your reply will make it through the filters on
my side.  The most obvious ones take care of HTML mail.  As in "Dave
Null might care, I don't"...
