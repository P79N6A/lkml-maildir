An easy look at pata_*.c seemed to indicate that at least 20 would 
almost certainly remain pata_*.c, maybe even as many as 30.
The circumstances you cite happened, yes, but I think you exaggerate the 
renaming.  Several soldered bridge solutions are already supported by 
libata.
Several do need to be renamed to ata_*.c, though.
