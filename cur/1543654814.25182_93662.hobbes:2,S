That one is for tight loops. Spin locks are inlined, and PAUSE is used like:
#define spin_lock_string \
        "\n1:\t" \
        "lock ; decb %0\n\t" \
        "js 2f\n" \
        LOCK_SECTION_START("") \
        "2:\t" \
        "cmpb $0,%0\n\t" \
        "rep;nop\n\t" \ <---
        "jle 2b\n\t" \
        "jmp 1b\n" \
        LOCK_SECTION_END
Also take a look at arch/i386/kernel/semaphore.c for read/write_locks.
