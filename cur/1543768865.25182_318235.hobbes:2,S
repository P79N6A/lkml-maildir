That is basically all JACK and mplayer use it for.  They have RT
constraints and the tsc is used to know if we got woken up too late and
should just drop some frames.  The developers are aware of the issues
with rdtsc and have chosen to use it anyway because these apps need
every ounce of CPU and cannot tolerate the overhead of gettimeofday().
