I did a test with a value of 500. echo 500 > 
/proc/sys/vm/vfs_cache_pressure.
The highest numbers a cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state then showed during
a du -s were
780721  750505  45      0       0       0
The system survied. No processes were killed.
With vfs_cache_pressure=100 a cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state showed
numbers of about 1090000 before processes got killed.
Hope that helps to narrow the region to look for what has changed.
