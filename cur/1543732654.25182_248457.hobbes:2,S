The code tries to put an entire hash bucket into a single seq_read(). 
That's not going to work if the hash is really deep.  On the other hand,
not much will, and it's simple.
The lock is only needed on traversing: htable_size can't change after
init anyway, so it should be done in ct_seq_show.
Fix should be fairly simple...
Rusty.
