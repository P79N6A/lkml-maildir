Any news about the ptrace single-stepping breakage of wine?
The application that stopped working for me is xst, the Xilinx HDL
synthesizer (there's a free as in beer version at
http://www.xilinx.com/xlnx/xebiz/designResources/ip_product_details.jsp?sGlobalNavPick=PRODUCTS&sSecondaryNavPick=Design
+Tools&key=DS-ISE-WEBPACK
). I'm currently at kernel 2.6.10-ac1 (as packaged by Arjan van de Ven),
and wine-20041201-1fc3winehq.
Compiling vhdl file H:/sailer/src/vhdl/xxx/vprim.vhd in Library synwork.
