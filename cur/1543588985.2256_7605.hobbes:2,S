If that is what this discussion is about, you may just be better off 
with a custom program to run instead of init.  Have you ever booted with 
init=/bin/bash?  Notice how it doesn't require a password . . . Use your 
own program here and you have no need of butchering the kernel.  Be much 
easier to maintain as well.
