I agree.  LogFS seems quite impressive in its performance, however I'm
wondering how much redesign and rewrite would be needed in the code to
fix the bad block handling.  Maybe it's not so much and I'm overly
paranoid, but having at least some idea of what it would take might
help.  You could add it to Documentation/filesystems/LogFS.txt as a
TODO.
