Why on earth would we want to remove a working feature ?
Just because it isn't getting patched every release doesn't mean
it's rotting, Oprofile is actually one of the few kernel features which I
don't recall a single regression in since 2.6.0
BROKEN is for stuff that doesn't compile, or is fundamentally flawed
beyond repair at the current time (For example, needs infrastructure
work to happen before it can work correctly).
Oprofile fits neither of those categories.
