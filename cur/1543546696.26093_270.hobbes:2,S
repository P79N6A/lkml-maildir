Let's say the minimum time is 50 cycles:
Process A last_cpu = 1
Process B last_cpu = 1
Process C last_cpu = 1
Process C runs for 200 cycles on CPU 1
Process C last_cpu = 1
Process A runs for 300 cycles on CPU 2
Process A last_cpu = 2
Process C is running on CPU 1
Process C last_cpu = 1
Process B runs for 15 cycles on CPU 2 but is interrupted
Process B last_cpu = 1 (unaltered)
Here we have:
Process A last_cpu = 2
Process B last_cpu = 1
Process C last_cpu = 1
C is currenty running on 1
Scheduler needs to pick a process for 2
A runs on 2
C is starved
I think you would have to not set last_cpu at all in
order to have time affinity work properly.
