is_dumpable tells you various things in 2.4, including whether the
curent memory image is valid, and as a race preventor for ptrace during
exec of setuid apps. You should probably talk to Solar Designer about
the whole design of the dump/suid race fixing work rather than me.
We also had to deal with another nasty case which could be fixed by grabbing
the mm at open time (which then opens a resource attack bug).
Consider what happens if your setuid app reads stdin
	setuidapp < /proc/self/mem
(No idea how 2.6 deals with these but if its got better backportable ways
 that *actually work* it might make sense).
