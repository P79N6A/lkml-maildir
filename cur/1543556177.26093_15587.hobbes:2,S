Is there any up-to-date (reasonably comprehensive) info available of what
has changed from 2.2 to 2.4 that you need to know when porting block,
network, and other device drivers from 2.2 to 2.4.
The document by Richard Gooch at
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/docs/porting-to-2.4.html
 is close
to what I'm looking for, but it is old and incomplete.
