Subject: [PATCH] DVB Needs I2C Core

DVB seems to be using i2c ( i2c_transfer() mainly ) all over the place but 
it is possible to build DVB without having I2C selected. This results in 
undefined symbol i2c_transfer in DVB module.
This patch makes I2C Core selected automatically if DVB is selected.
Is it the right thing to do?
Thanks
