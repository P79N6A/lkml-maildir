Yes it is, but it's down to the way folk want things to operate.  The
first two come from the legacy table in include/asm-*/serial.h.  The
second two come from something-that-I-have-no-clue-about but is probably
ACPI related.  Dunno.  We're back to the far-too-many-complex-ways-to-
initialise-serial problem again that I've given up really caring how
many lines of serial printk junk folk end up with.  I can't fight it
all.
