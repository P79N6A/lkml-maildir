HI All,
	This might seem a stupid little question but I would like to apply a
pre-patch to 2.2.12 to take it to 2.2.13pre14. I downloaded the file and
uncompressed. Normally when applying patches I do
	patch -p0  < patch-xxx 
which works fine. Is this right for prepatches.  I downloaded a fresh 2.2.12
distribution and tried to apply it aginst that but it still failed. What am I
doing wrong?
