Hello everyone,
I have problems compiling kernel 2.0.38. There seems to be problems with
assembly code in at least one include file (string.h) with the versions of gcc
I've tried.  I'm using the Debian (potato) distribution and I've tried:
With and without the kernel patch at:
http://www.suse.de/~florian/kernel
+egcs.html
with these two compilers:
gcc 2.95.2 (egcs)
gcc 2.7.2.3
This is a related link:
http://tanglefoot.lunatech.com/doc/gcc/faq.html#asmclobber
And yes, /usr/src/[linux,asm] are linked to the kernel source.
The error looks like this:
# make install
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2
-fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strength-reduce -pipe -m486 -malign-loops=2
-malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=686  -c -o init/main.o init/main.c
In file included from init/main.c:46:
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/bugs.h: In function `check_k6_bug':
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/string.h:118: Invalid `asm' statement:
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/string.h:118: fixed or forbidden register 4 (si) was spilled for class SIREG.
[ Here follows multiple errors derived from string.h]
Can someone help me out??
I don't wish to rewrite the assembly, x86 assembly is horrible. Now 68K
assembly I can handle but then I wouldn't have asked in the first place.
[--------
The reason I wan't to try kernel 2.0.38 is that I STILL haven't found an
explanation to why my SMP machine is unresponsive during writes to disk. Not
beeing able to move the mouse pointer or use the keyboard while bonnie is
writing to disk is ridiculous considering the dual 450 MHz CPUs, SCSI disk and
controller. I can ping the machine from the network but logging in? forget it.
Here's my post from last week:
