I'm having a little trouble seeing how adding a new type (RCLM_FALLBACK)
helps.  Seems to me that pages put into the RCLM_FALLBACK area would have
gone to the global free list and available to anyone.  I must be missing
something here.

Do you really need that last line?  Can an allocation of type RCLM_FALLBACK
realy be made?
