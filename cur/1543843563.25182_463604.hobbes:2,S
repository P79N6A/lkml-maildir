No, I'm precisely not claiming that the tracepoints I was looking for
were "relevant to everybody". They are, however, very relevant to any
standard sysadmin or developer who wants to get a better picture of
what his kernel is doing. Again, please refer to figure 2 of this
article and explain to me why it's not relevant for standard users
and developers to understand when these events happen inside the
kernel:
