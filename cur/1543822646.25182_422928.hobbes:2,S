It depends on whats running at the time... with some light load, i measured 
wall clock time, i remember seeing 2 secs at times, but its been a long time
i did that.. so take that with a pinch :-)_
i will try to get those idle and load times worked out again... the best
i have is a  16 way, if i get help from big system oems i will send the 
numbers out
