Agreed, that should count as 'on the platter'.  Unless the battery is flat...

Linux drivers?  Isn't that a simple matter of coding? ;-)

OK, thanks for the clear definition of the problem.  This corresponds
to my reading of this document:
   
http://www.storage.ibm.com/hardsoft/products/ess/pubs/f2ascsi1.pdf
   Ordered Queue Tag:
   The command begins execution after all previously issued commands
   complete.  Subsequent commands may not begin execution until this
   command completes (unless they are issued with Head of Queue tag
   messages).
But chances are, almost all the IOs ahead of the journal commit belong
to your same filesystem anyway, so you may be worrying too much about
possibly waiting for something on another partition.
In theory, bio could notice the barrier coming down the pipe and hold
back commands on other partitions, if they're too far away physically.

Everything else seems to be getting major surgery these days, so...

It shouldn't matter, if the ordered queue tag is implemented properly.
From the thread I gather it isn't always, which means we need a
blacklist, or putting on a happier face, a whitelist.

I should state it more precisely: 'this request is a write barrier for this
partition'.  Is that what you had in mind?
