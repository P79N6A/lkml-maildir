a) megaraid always used a set of basic typedefs. Seems to be your personal
view not general comment
b) Probably right

Not on 2.2

Looks fine to me anyway

Doesnt work on 2.4

Its ok on older kernels 2.2/2.4 wont afaik ever use it.

TRUE/FALSE is IMHO perfectly clear

Definitely wants fixing

Actually the timeout means the worst that occurs is you wait a 
second, and the code is portable to old 2.2/2.4
