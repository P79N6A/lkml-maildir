This is a workaround for a TCP problem which you probably don't have based
on your comments below.  Why do I think you don't have this problem?  See
below.

This fix applies to slow start for TCP connections that usually involve
things like streaming, etc.  You noted in your email that ping had high
latency times, well, ping is ICMP, not TCP, and does not use slow start.
Also, interactive TCP sessions such as telnet/ssh are very unlikely to show
a problem with slow start.
Later,
