Thanks for the tip.  I'll try the patch.
Another question - is there any chance that this bug could be
responsible for a slowdown in network processing.  Some of my machines
get themselves into a state in which their ability to serve
network traffic (they're running squid) is significantly reduced -
perhaps by a factor of two.  I wish I had more specific data, but at
this point it's a mystery.  What I'm really wondering is whether
there's any chance at all that this kernel bug could be behind my
performance problem, or should I look elsewhere.
TIA,
John Salmon
