The last bit was what threw me.  It seemed that the kernel was changed to do 
the right thing, but only as a compatability measure that would be dropped 
because userspace should be changed to start doing it (which seemed crazy).
It seems that the _warning_ is the compatability measure that will be dropped 
(or perhaps the ability for userspace to do the wrong thing at all?), and the 
kernel will continue to DTRT.
It's a bit confusing for those of us coming in late in the discussion. :)
