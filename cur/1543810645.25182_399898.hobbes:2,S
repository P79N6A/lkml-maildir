I'm assuming you are talking about 32-bit machines here, but even there
I can mmap() larger than that. I'd never keep segments that large
anyways, were I to do anything like that I'd just munmap/mmap again like
I currently do. But again, it's not an issue for me, seems we are
arguing pretty irrelevant details right now.

I don't transfer it - this is what happens:
        pad = get_subbuf_padding(tip, tip->ofile_offset);
        if (pad == -1)
                goto err;
        ts->len = buf_size - pad;
        if (net_send_header(tip, ts->len))
                goto err;
        if (net_sendfile(tip, ts))
                goto err;

Yeah, I don't check the padding to avoid sending that extra
sizeof(blk_io_trace) - foo, which is a net save of max 48 bytes or so.
It's done purely to send only sane data.

I have added sendfile() support already, as that is what I'm using :-)
If you pull the current blktrace git repo, you'll see the blktrace
kernel patch contains a sendfile() hook for file_operations.
If there was a straight-forward to use mmap operation, I would surely
use it and scrap the read.

The sendfile() I did is comparable to the read(), it will serve as much
as you have available. blktrace does per-subbuffer sends though, as we
need to figure the padding. blktrace passes NULL as offset to use the
current position, and it does update the consumer position at the end.
So it works pretty much as you expect.

Ok, I'll have a look and see if I can extract something interesting for
my use (and generically).
