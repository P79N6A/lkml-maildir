I was trying to compile the Unionfs[1] to get it up to sync it up with
the kernel developments from the past few months. Anyway, long story
short...swapper_space (defined in mm/swap_state.c) is not exported
anymore (git commit: 4936967374c1ad0eb3b734f24875e2484c3786cc). This
apparently is not an issue for most modules. Troubles arise when the
modules include mm.h or any of its relatives.
One simply gets a linker error about swapper_space not being defined.
The problem is that it is used in mm.h.
I included a reverse patch to export the symbol again.

Export swapper_space because several include files reference it.
