Personally I try to go for fairness and latency in -rmap,
since most real workloads I've encountered don't seem to
have throughput problems.
The standard "it's getting slow" complaint has been about
response time and fairness 90% of the time, usually when
the system stalls one process during some other activity.

Tuning the current system for latency and fairness should
keep most people happy. Desktop users really won't notice
if unpacking an RPM takes 20% longer, but having their
mp3 skip during RPM unpacking is generally considered
unacceptable.
