Interesting point here - did you check whether the 3c905B was in 10bT
or 100bTx mode?
The reason I ask is that I have a FH705 hub at home, with a 3c905C Tornado
card.  It normally negociates 100bTx with the hub at power on, but
if for whatever reason it drops down to 10bT, the only way of getting
it back to 100bTx is with a power cycle of the 3c905C (and hence the
machine).
No amount of prodding with mii-diag (forcing media selections, resetting
the mii transceiver) will recover it - only a power cycle solves it.
Luckily, it doesn't do it spontaneously, and has been running at 100bTx
for the past months.  Since it is my main server, and works, I'm not too
eager to investigate futher.  You might be interested in this data point
however.
