Weird.  You are getting silent write errors...
Can you write to these drives are all? e.g.
  dd if=/dev/sdb3 of=/tmp/tmp count=1
  dd if=/tmp/tmp of=/dev/sdb3 oflag=direct
(hopefully 'direct' will cause write errors to be passed up).
I really think this looks like a sata problem, not an md problem.
