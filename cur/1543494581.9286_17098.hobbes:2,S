Err, I get this if I change anything in the partition table of a drive which
has one or more mounted partitions. Granted, I'm using an ancient fdisk.
Someone (Andre?) was muttering a while back about reducing the granularity
so if you didn't affect the mounted partitions, you didn't have to reboot.
I don't recall the outcome, tho'.
