I have a 2.5.58 box that's a simple firewall/router w/ iptables running 
on it.  It crashes and reboots automatically roughly every other day.  
It's been doing that for a  long time and I never had the time to debug 
it.  I'll put .62 on it with a serial console and see what it comes up 
with.  It runs two PPPoE channels over ethX.  PPPoE is known to blow up 
(OOPS) on pppd hangup/restarts.
