The same /etc/sysconfig/lm_sensors has been working for many 2.6 kernels ;)

See below. I booted again on 2.6.9-jam1 (mm1 with fixes collected from LKML).

I updated my sensors userspace to latest cvs to check if some kind of
de-synchronisation was the cause:
werewolf:~> sensors -v
sensors version 2.9.0-CVS with libsensors version 2.9.0-CVS
sensors-detect on 2.6.9-mm1:
 Now follows a summary of the probes I have just done.
 Just press ENTER to continue: 
Driver `to-be-written' (should be inserted):
  Detects correctly:
  * Bus `SMBus I801 adapter at 0500' (Algorithm unavailable)
    Busdriver `i2c-i801', I2C address 0x2f (and 0x48 0x49)
    Chip `Winbond W83792D' (confidence: 8)
Driver `smbus-arp' (should be inserted):
  Detects correctly:
  * Bus `SMBus I801 adapter at 0500' (Algorithm unavailable)
    Busdriver `i2c-i801', I2C address 0x61
    Chip `SMBus 2.0 ARP-Capable Device' (confidence: 1)
Driver `it87' (may not be inserted):
  Misdetects:
  * ISA bus address 0x0290 (Busdriver `i2c-isa')
    Chip `ITE IT8705F / IT8712F / SiS 950' (confidence: 8)
Driver `w83627hf' (should be inserted):
  Detects correctly:
  * ISA bus address 0x0290 (Busdriver `i2c-isa')
    Chip `Winbond W83627THF Super IO Sensors' (confidence: 9)
To make the sensors modules behave correctly, add these lines to
/etc/modules.conf:
#----cut here----
# I2C module options
alias char-major-89 i2c-dev
#----cut here----
To load everything that is needed, add this to some /etc/rc* file:
#----cut here----
# I2C adapter drivers
modprobe i2c-i801
modprobe i2c-isa
# I2C chip drivers
# no driver for Winbond W83792D yet
modprobe smbus-arp
modprobe w83627hf
# sleep 2 # optional
/usr/local/bin/sensors -s # recommended
#----cut here----
With this modules (no smbus-arp):
w83627hf               25128  0 
eeprom                  7072  0 
i2c_sensor              3456  2 w83627hf,eeprom
i2c_isa                 2304  0 
i2c_i801                7820  0 
i2c_core               19712  5 w83627hf,eeprom,i2c_sensor,i2c_isa,i2c_i801
I can see this:
werewolf:~> ls /sys/bus/i2c/devices
0-0050@ 0-0052@ 1-0290@
Now, 2.6.10-rc2-mm3:
Driver `to-be-written' (should be inserted):
  Detects correctly:
  * Bus `SMBus I801 adapter at 0500' (Algorithm unavailable)
    Busdriver `i2c-i801', I2C address 0x2f (and 0x48 0x49)
    Chip `Winbond W83792D' (confidence: 8)
Driver `smbus-arp' (should be inserted):
  Detects correctly:
  * Bus `SMBus I801 adapter at 0500' (Algorithm unavailable)
    Busdriver `i2c-i801', I2C address 0x61
    Chip `SMBus 2.0 ARP-Capable Device' (confidence: 1)
Driver `it87' (may not be inserted):
  Misdetects:
  * ISA bus address 0x0290 (Busdriver `i2c-isa')
    Chip `ITE IT8705F / IT8712F / SiS 950' (confidence: 8)
Driver `w83627hf' (should be inserted):
  Detects correctly:
  * ISA bus address 0x0290 (Busdriver `i2c-isa')
    Chip `Winbond W83627THF Super IO Sensors' (confidence: 9)
With same modules inserted:
w83627hf               24224  0 
eeprom                  6168  0 
i2c_sensor              3328  2 w83627hf,eeprom
i2c_isa                 2304  0 
i2c_i801                7692  0 
i2c_core               18560  6 i2c_dev,w83627hf,eeprom,i2c_sensor,i2c_isa,i2c_i801
werewolf:~# ls /sys/bus/i2c/devices 
0-0050@  0-0052@
So i see the two DIMMS but not the 0x0290 bus.
I'm going to try with the other modules I am missing, smbus-arp and it87, but
this setup works in 2.6.9...
If you need any info, just ask for.
Hope this helps. Thanks.
