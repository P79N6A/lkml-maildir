Just a question about this. When I attempt to patch a vanilla 2.3.6 kernel with 
the e2compr patch for 2.3.6 it fails with patch 2.5 built from standard sources. 
The only way it can partially work is if I set a fuzz factor of about 3 or so. 
Even so there are other failures in various makefiles and a couple of the major 
ext2 source files. My question is has anyone come across this and what is the 
fix. I just want to think that I am not on crack or something.
