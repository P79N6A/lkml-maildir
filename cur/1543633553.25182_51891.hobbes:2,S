I disagreed, so I measured, and you are right 8(  I hate that.
Simply reading the performance monitors across all CPUs is a case
where the extra loop overhead is significant (although cache effects
may still dominate): 9 times slower on PPC if there are only 2 CPUs
and NR_CPUS is 32.
I'd definitely prefer a per-arch for_each_cpu() implementation to
exposing a mapping, eg:
	/* No hotplug cpus on this arch. */
	extern int max_cpu_num;
	#define for_each_cpu(__i) for (__i = 0; __i < max_cpu_num; __i++)
OR
	extern int cpu_next_map[NR_CPUS];
	#define for_each_cpu(__i) \
		for (__i = 0; __i < NR_CPUS; __i = cpu_next_map[__i])
[ Soapbox mode: cut here ]
My philosophy is that parts of infrastructure which is not used by >
90% of people tends to get misused.  Two recent concrete examples:
	cpu_logical_map() is currently a noop on x86
		=> Ingo fucked it up in his initial scheduler impl.
	copy_from_user() returns POSTIVE on failure
		=> 7% of uses of copy_from_user were buggy in 2.5.19.
My feeling is that kernel coding is becoming more challenging (SMP,
preemption, portability), and our bug count and time-to-kernel-mastery
is climbing as a result.  One method of countering this is by
carefully designing infrastructure to make the simplest method for
writing common operations also the correct one.
Sometimes old-timers don't see infrastructure they are used to as a
problem, but even they make mistakes.
