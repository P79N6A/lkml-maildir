Its very hard to tell. Most people I ask cannot reproduce their crashes with
the Nvidia driver unloaded. Equally many of them only got one crash in weeks
anyway.
Some of the stuff is more clear - the business about 4Mb pages on Athlon for
example. That may be a hardware, a driver or even a subtle interaction with
something elsewhere in the kernel - eg the memcpy prefetching bug I fixed
in 2.4.19-pre4-ac4
It doesn't alter the fact that its undebuggable by the community, and that is
the real problem. Fortunately the open source nvidia driver work seems to be
at the point it can just about play Quake2/3
