At point 4 you are introducing a NEW ntp adjustment.  This, I submit, 
needs to actually have been introduced to the system prior to the 
interrupt at point 2 with the first xtime change at point 4.  However, 
gettimeofday() should be aware of it from the interrupt at point 2 and 
be doing corrections from that time forward.  Thus when the point 4 
interrutp happens xtime will be the same at the gettimeofday a ns earlier.
Likewise, gettimeofday() needs to know when to stop apply the correction 
so that if a tick is late, it will apply the correction only for those 
times that it was needed.  This, could be done by figuring the offset 
thusly:
offset = (offset from last tick to end of ntp period * ntp_adj1) + 
(offset from end of ntp period to now)
I suppose it is possible that the latter part of the offset is also 
under a different ntp correction which would mean a "* ntp_adj2" is 
needed.  I would argue that only two terms are needed here regardless of 
how late a tick is.  This is because, I would expect the ntp system call 
to sync the two clocks.  This means in your example, the ntp call would 
have been made at, or prior to the timer interrupt at 2 and this is the 
same edge that gettimeofday is to used to start applying the correction.

I think this may have been done with only usec gettimeofday.  Now that 
we have clock_gettime() returning nsec, we need to be a bit more careful.
