I meant, I didn't know why he thought barriers might apply in this case, but 
now that you mention it, yes we risk the same bugs with certain hardware as, 
say, a journal commit does.  We need to do something about that at some 
point.  (I see that the barrier patch hasn't made it to mainline yet, and 
actually, that's good because it needs to be looked at critically.)
Anyway (reading Andi's mind) it seems the snapshot durability strategy just 
wasn't obvious on a light reading.  It certainly wasn't obvious to me without 
clarification from Joe Thornber, from whose fertile imagination this clever 
hack apparently sprang.  Yes, these details need to be documented.
Regards,
Daniel
