Hello Herbert,
HP> what does an  fsck.ext3 -fpn  on the unmounted filesystem report?
I downloaded 2.4.21 sources, made "make oldconfig" and got a new
kernel with the same behavior :(
fsck.ext3 (e2fsck 1.27 8-Mar-2002)
run all 5 passes with no error reports under an old kernel, but under
new one it says:
fsck.ext3: No such file or directory while trying to open /dev/hdc1
The superblock could not be read....
etc.
I get further into this, and I find that I have no /dev/hdc1 (and
/dev/hdc, and /dev/hda too) at all! In place of them(?), I have
/dev/discs/~disc0/disc
/dev/discs/~disc0/part1
/dev/discs/~disc0/part2
/dev/discs/~disc0/part3
/dev/discs/~disc1/disc
/dev/discs/~disc1/part1
e2fsck gets them as previous /dev/hd+ args and reports no errors.
Is this a new feature since 2.4.18-3 kernel? Or maybe this all because
I add something strange to my config, like "/dev filesystem" ?
