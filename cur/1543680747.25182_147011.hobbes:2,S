I think that in this particular case, if should have configured your 
interface address with 2002:v4:addr::/16, of which subnet anycast router 
address would be 2002::.

This *may* be caused by another issue too: nexthop's must be given in the
compatible "::192.88.99.1" format, not 2002:xxxx :-(
I sent a patch on over a year or so ago, but it didn't gain that much 
enthusiasm..
