1. this code is executed only if vc_utf_count != 0
which means uncompleted UTF-8 sequence, because in case of proper UTF-8 
sequence or normal mode vc_utf_count == 0 in these places of code.
2. vc_npar is not used while completing UTF-seqence so I used it as a 
counter of scanned sequence continuation bytes, it is set to 0 if begin 
of UTF-8 seqence is detected and vc_utf_count set to number of 
continuation bytes
3. when you can't display replacement glyph bad sequence is ignored as 
previously so vc_utf_count and vc_npar is zeroed in case of  malformed 
UTF-8 seqence and there is no loop - anyway replacement glyph
should always be defined IMHO or I must change this code because
it seems not to be correct to use c as tc as a last resort because in 
this case c means byte value which malformed scanned seqence so it is 
not valuable for us. Maybe the better way is to use "?" char as a last
resort instead of c value. What do you think?
Maybe I should remember all bytes of the UTF-sequence to use their 
values as a last resort char in case of malformed sequence and 0xfffd
not defined?
