Alan Cox's 'ac' patches contain Ion Badulescu's fix for this problem.
The problem essentially boils down to the NFSv2 protocol not really
supporting a 'mkfifo' command (it only appears in NFSv3). One then has
a choice between two common hacks for supporting mkfifo on UNIX
systems. Unfortunately, most servers only support the 'other' hack...
