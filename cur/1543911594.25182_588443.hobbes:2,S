Unless I'm misunderstanding it this is not the last time ever this 
election will be held.
And it's best to define election rules in a relaxed situation like now - 
it saves you much hassle when there are already fixed rules if there 
will ever be for any reason a fierce battle between candidates.
"fixed rules" doesn't has to be complicated, e.g. something like:
- elected by KS attendees
- every attendee has as many votes as open positions available
- no cumulative voting
- the candidates with most votes are elected
- if there's a draw flip a coin
- if requested by at least one attendee, vote will be secret
would work fine and wouldn't result in overhead for uncontroversial 
elections.
E.g. the latest SPI Board of Directors elections were followed by a 
discussion how different vote counting methods would have changed the 
result - but it was only a theoretical discussion since the election 
rules are fixed.
