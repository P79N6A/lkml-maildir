I have number of machines that have <defunct> kswapd processes - I'm
fairly sure what is causing this - it's an issue with autofs v4 and a
'VFS: Busy inodes after unmount. Self-destruct in 5 seconds  Have a nice
day...' problem.
There are a few threads about this on the linux-nfs list - e.g.
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=106332683300004&r=1&w=2
Using autofs v4.1.0 appears to fix this problem.
However, I was wondering what would be the side effects of having a
<defunct> kswapd? - the box _appears_ to keep running fine (running
heavy CPU/memory applications).
Thanks
