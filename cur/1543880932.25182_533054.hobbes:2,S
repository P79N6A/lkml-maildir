This is wrong. SSB does not depend on PCI or PCMCIA.
SSB can (and does) stay very well on its own feet and
can be the main system bus.
Most Linksys WRT routers work that way. They have no
PCI bus, but a SSB bus instead.
Nevertheless, I'm not sure what your problem really is.
Does a s390 machine exist with a B44 card? I doubt it.
So what about the following: We simply add
a DEPENDS ON !S390 to both SSB and B44.
I really thing that is the right fix for this.
The patch above is clearly not, as it breaks things for
embedded devices without PCI or PCMCIA bus.
