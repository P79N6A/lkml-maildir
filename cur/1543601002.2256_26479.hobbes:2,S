        Hello folks!
    People most likely needs first oops most of the time, so
  it would be great to make a kernel boot option to stop after
  first oops, so in the situations when its neede life can be made easy.
    Actually afaics this is being done each time by hand, so 
  panic() in BUG() as Rik proposed would be nice.
    What do you folks think?
cheers, Sam
