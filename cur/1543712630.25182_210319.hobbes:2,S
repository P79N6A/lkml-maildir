False. The semantics are currently "don't care" and the ADT fails to
ignore the upper bits in cpumask_arith.h. It's a bug in the ADT code.
Whether callers experience ill effects is irrelevant.

You're missing the changes needed for cpus_shift_left() and
cpus_promote() to satisfy zeroed tail postconditions. IIRC the needed
changes to cpus_shift_left() are also missing from your other patches
in the bitmap code. You are also changing the invariants, which should
be the substance of a patch different from any bugfix.
