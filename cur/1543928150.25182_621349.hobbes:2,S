In the cases where these are kernel developers that do (or should) 
handle dozens of bugs each week I see a point if they have problems 
integrating some medium into their workflow.
But in all software, no matter whether open source or commercial, bug 
reporters simply have to use whatever the vendor offers as support 
channel.

That developers who know what they are doing might bypass the bug
tracking is not a problem.

This sounds like "a bit pregnant"...
Tracking requires things like e.g. categorizing the issue and marking it 
as fixed when it got fixed.
