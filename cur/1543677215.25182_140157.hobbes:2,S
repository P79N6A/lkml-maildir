Well, you could replace the uses of FIXADDR_START/FIXADDR_TOP with 
something like FIXADDR_USER_START/FIXADDR_USER_TOP, and then force those 
to cover only the _one_ user-accessible page.
Something like
	#define FIXADDR_USER_START (fix_to_virt(FIX_VSYSCALL))
	#define FIXADDR_USER_END (FIXADDR_USER_START + PAGE_SIZE)
should work. In that case you can drop the page table testing, since we 
"know" it is safe.
But I'm too lazy to test, so please send a tested patch,
