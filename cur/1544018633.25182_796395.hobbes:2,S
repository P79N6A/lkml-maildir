Definitely. Collectively, I see boards from 4 major archs
boot and use a serial console on a daily basis. Including
a pretty decent set of x86 boards.

Interesting. In the past the BIOS has normally given us
problems when trying to get grub to output via serial,
first contact often appears once the kernel is booting.

Haven't witnessed B or C, but have had plenty of flow control
problems with infrastructure that prevented serial from properly
displaying.
I've also seen a few minor issues in the kernel itself, but it's
normally some slightly different chip and/or polling mode changes
interfering with normal operation. None of which seem useful
here.

I'm not much help, but I thought some extra data
points *might* be of use.
