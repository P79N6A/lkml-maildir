Actually, I like the helper. It is safest solution, and list of cached
pages in memory is going to be usefull for other stuff, too.
Imagine:
cat /dev/give-me-list-of-pages-in-page-cache > /tmp/delme.suspend
echo disk > /sys/power/state
nice ( cat /tmp/delme.suspend | read-those-pages-back ) &
Result is quite obviously safe (unless you mess up locking while
dumping pagecache), and it is going to be rather easy to test. Just
load the system as  much as you can while doing
while true; do cat /dev/give-me-list-of-pages-in-page-cache >
/dev/null; done
. Still, limiting image size to 500MB is probably easier solution. I'm
looking forward to that page.
