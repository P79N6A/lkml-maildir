I think his traffic is mostly 'send' from his server's perspective.
He's reading from disk with sendfile too, I believe, so maybe that
would be consuming lots of pages of memory?
However, in my case, I would definately welcome something that auto-tuned
the VM to give me lots and lots of GFP_ATOMIC pages.  As it is now, I
end up setting the /proc/sys/vm/freepages much higher.  Since it appears
the name has changed and I didn't notice, I guess my script to set
this has not actually been doing anything useful in the 2.6 kernel series :P
