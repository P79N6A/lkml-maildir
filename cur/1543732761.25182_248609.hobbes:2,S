Looks good apart from this.  There's no guarantee that LR will be the
return address inside one of these lock functions - indeed the compiler
may have saved it onto the stack and decided to use the register for
something else.
Your best bet is to look at the get_wchan() code which walks the stack
frames (if present.)
