Ingo,
The first patch is critical, and needs to stay with trace_output.c
Not that critical since trace_output.c is not in mainline yet.
The second patch gives the ability to stack trace functions.
I've been leery about adding this and still keep it a separate
option from the "stacktrace" that already exists. This is because
when enabled with no filtering, the lag between typing and seeing
what is typed can be up to 10 seconds or more.
I made the function stack trace an option attached to the function
tracer, so it must be enabled after the function tracer has been
set. This still needs to be updated in ftrace.txt.
The following patches are in:
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rostedt/linux-2.6-trace.git
    branch: tip/devel
