Subject: [PATCH 1/2] zone init check and report unaligned zone boundaries fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

zone init check and report unaligned zone boundaries fix
We are reporting bad boundaries for the first zone which is allowed
to be missaligned because nodes are not allowed to be missaligned,
and zones which have zero size.  Cull them.
