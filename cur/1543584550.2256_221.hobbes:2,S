Assuming index is in bytes (it looks like it is): Shouldn't index of type 
unsigned long long or __u64? Otherwise, AFAICS using the page cache 
automatically results in an artificial 4Gib limit on file size, which is 
not very good, even by todays standards.

Is this physical I/O only or does it include a driver writing/reading the page?
Thanks,
