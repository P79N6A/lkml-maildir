I was just thinking that it might be cleaner to register a structure
instead of tracking identifiers to usecs. You might get a speed up on
some of the operations, like unregister.
Another thing I was thinking about is that this seems somewhat contrary
to the idea of using dynamic tick (assuming it was in mainline) to
heuristically pick a power state. Do you have any thoughts on how you
would combine the two?
