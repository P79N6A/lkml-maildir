yes, the spinlock in struct address_space would be enough, and that's
what 2.4 does too, Andrew changed it to a semaphore in 2.6 but it can be
made a spinlock again. Then you can fix it (as far as you never call it
from an irq and as far as you don't generate exceptions inside the
critical section, but I'm sure you don't).
