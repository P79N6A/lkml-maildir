Hi David,
  after your $ARCH => $(ARCH) fix in main Makefile make system
on my machine now believes that arch/i386/vmlinux.lds should
be built through vmlinux.lds.S => (rule in Makefile) vmlinux.lds.s => 
(default as,ld) => vmlinux.lds, although neither of vmlinux.lds.S nor 
vmlinux.lds.s does exist :-( So build fails.
  I was not able to fix problem other way than moving
arch/$(ARCH)/vmlinux.lds.s rule down to arch's Makefiles, but I believe
that there must be some better way to do that...
                                  Thanks,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
