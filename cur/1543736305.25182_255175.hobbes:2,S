I have purchased a book "Linux Device Drivers" By
Alessandro Rubini. I have an eagerness to learn the
Kernel Programming and this is my first step.
I request all of you to help me resolving my problems
as I have this mailing list as a only source to leanr
Kernel Programming.
I have read the example hello.c which illustrates a
simple module.
I was not able to load a module in a running Kernel
2.4.20-6 [ comes with Red Hat Linux 9.0] as it gives
me a following error:
[root@localhost KernelProg]# insmod ./helloMod.o
./helloMod.o: kernel-module version mismatch
        ./helloMod.o was compiled for kernel version
2.4.20
        while this kernel is version 2.4.20-6.
Please guide me how to proceed further in loading this
example module.
Thanks & Regards
Dinesh
