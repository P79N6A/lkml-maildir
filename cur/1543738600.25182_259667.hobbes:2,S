I can't say for certain, but I'm guessing that your laptop has a deeply
broken BIOS that implements ACPI and suchlike by using SMM, which blocks
out interrupts, and there's nothing, I believe, you can do about it.
Disabling ACPI seems sensible; at least you can avoid causing these delays
intentionally, but if some sensor interrupt triggers a flip into SMM to
enable the fan, you're just screwed for a number of milliseconds.
