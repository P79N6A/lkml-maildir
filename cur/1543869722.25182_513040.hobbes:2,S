So what?  If they can occur, you have to handle them.

Duff SIGSEGV or SIGBUS signal handlers are just as realistic.  All that takes
is for someone to make a programming error.  Remember: error paths are the
least frequently tested.
And any time you say "by carefully setting up" you can guarantee someone's
going to do it wrong.
