Please do not make sleep_on() generate a warning.  Unless you intend
to do the same to lock_kernel().
ext3 uses sleep_on().  It is perfectly safe.   Weaning ext3 off lock_kernel()
is a large, delicate and thus-far undesigned body of work.  I've been
working on other stuff and it is quite unlikely that ext3 locking will
be redesigned in the 2.5 timeframe.

Sounds like pointless churn to me.  How about we fix some real stuff and get
this kernel out the door before we all die?
