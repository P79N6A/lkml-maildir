We chould probably also convert the list_head over to an hlist_head,
for a modest saving in size (although that's more important from a
cache footprint POV rather than improving cacheline bouncing).
Although speaking of cacheline footprint: making the hash table so
large will increase the "real" CPU cacheline footprint on your VSMP
systems, so perhaps it is not always such an easy decision.
Definitely for "normal" systems, we do not want to pad out to a
single entry per cacheline, so the current patch can not go upstream
as is.
