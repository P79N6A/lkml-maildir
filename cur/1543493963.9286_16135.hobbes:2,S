Andrea,
I just build your andrea3 on a low memory machine, it will not work well.
Launched Netscape, clicked a link that opened up a second browser window,
segfault, kernel oops.
48MB machine. I would try to do some oops tracing but I really need this
machine up right now for some other work I am doing and I have had enough
trouble trying to get the filesystem put back together after two of the
above described events (completely reproducable).
If I can get back around to it this week I will try to provide you with
more information. As for last night's compile failure ... got no idea what
that was about ... I completely deleted my tree and reinstalled the linux
tree and your patch and it compiled without complaint.
