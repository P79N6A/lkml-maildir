Marcelo, All,
	In set_ioapic_affinity() we take a cpu mask which we normally pass into
the apic. However, on xapics in clustered physical mode (ie: x440s) we
need to convert this mask into a physical apicid before sending it to
the apic. If clustered_apic_mode is XAPIC, this patch selects the lowest
cpu in the mask and routes the interrupts there. This avoids
timedoubling and other interrupt misdirection seen on x440s after
playing with /proc/irq/x/smp_affinity. 
Please apply.
thanks
