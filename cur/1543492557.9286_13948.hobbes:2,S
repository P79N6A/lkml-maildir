In addition, the kernel should REFUSE to set the cap flag if the file
in question has either of the group-write or world-write attributes
set, of if the file does NOT have the owner-execute bit set. It should
also clear the owner-write attribute if that is set.
2A) When a process tries to modify the permissions of a file that has
the cap flag set, refuse to modify the permissions if the new
permissions have any write attribute set, or if they have the
owner-execute bit cleared, returning an error message indicating that
such settings are incompatible with capabilities.
2B) When a process tries to modify the owner or group of a file that
has the cap flag set, treat this as being an "unset cap flag, make
change, set cap flag" sequence of operations, and make NO changes
unless the entire sequence would complete successfully.

This can be done to the extent required by capabilities by
implementing rule 2A instead. Note that it should NOT be an error to
clear the group-execute or world-execute attributes of a capable
binary, since that only restricts who can run it and not what it can
do. In addition, 2B deals with the possibility of a limited capability
user cracking into a more capable user's account and using that
account to create a capable binary with them as owner.

There's one possible security scare I can see with your proposal,
which is the following:
 1. Use a cap-aware kernel to create an executable with enhanced
    capabilities.
 2. System gets rebooted to a cap-ignorant kernel for some reason.
 3. Use tools under the cap-ignorant kernel to add other capabilities
    to the said executable.
 4. System later gets rebooted back to the cap-aware kernel.
 5. User runs said executable, which now has modified behaviour and
    capabilities.
Whilst that appears to be a difficult scenario to follow, it is most
definately a valid one to watch for, and I would suggest the following
addition to your prosal to help deal with it.
 4) Include in the capabilities header a field holding the timestamp
of the last capabilities validation.
 5) When a process tries to run a capable binary, check the validation
timestamp against the current kernel boot timestamp, and if they are
different (in either direction), perform a complete capabilities
validation on that binary, clearing the cap flag if it fails, and
setting the validation timestamp to the current kernel boot timestamp
only if it succeeds.
 6) In addition, modify point 1 to also set the validation timestamp
to the current kernel boot timestamp if it successfully set the cap
flag.
Note that I haven't said to set the validation timestamp to the
current time when the successful validation is done since that leaves
the possibility of an attack where the attacker sets the validation
timestamp to some future time well after the next likely kernel
reboot. The method selected makes such an attack pointless.
One side effect of this method is that each capable binary will get
revalidated ONCE after each reboot, thus ensuring that any binaries
where capabilities are honoured has been reliably validated as such.
Best wishes from Riley.
