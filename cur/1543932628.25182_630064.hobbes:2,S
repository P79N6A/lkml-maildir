This whole thing is too ugly for words.
First of all, it87 only accesses two I/O ports: IT87_ADDR_REG_OFFSET
and IT87_DATA_REG_OFFSET, which are at offsets 5 and 6 from the base.
So if it87 reserved only those ports, e.g., 0x295-0x296, I think things
would work fine (or at least, as well as they used to).
Secondly, it87 ignores any information from the BIOS and grubs around
for a superio chip at a magic address and tries to figure out what's
behind it.  I know this is because we don't know the "real" way to
read those sensors, but it still sucks, and it still means we're likely
to have conflicts with ACPI usage of the device.  And no, I don't have
anything useful like an ACPI driver to offer :-)
