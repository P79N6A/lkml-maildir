Ok, apparently I was wrong.. 5.1.28 still does not work reliably with the
AHA2940U2W and detection of mediachange (by a CHECK_CONDITION on next
command and MEDIA CHANGE mode sense reply). Theoretically something in the
driver could zero out some bytes of the modesense info, but I doubt it.
It looks more like several Mode Sense are issued and the first reply
(which is the only one showing the MEDIA CHANGE) is lost. However, from
printk's in the driver it seems only one Mode Sense is issued. So all this
looks like a sequencer problem to me.
This is an informational message only. I'll contact the aic7xxx people
directly.
I'm still wondering if anyone had success with a removable disk and/or
tape on a AHA2940U2W. From what I experience here, I'd claim that those
are doomed to fail with this driver.
Michael.
