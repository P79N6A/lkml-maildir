Is there something funny about Cisco APs with hidden SSID? I made a patch for ieee80211 and softmac
that works on my AP when its SSID is hidden. It also works for Paul Marks on his personal AP, but
fails for the Cisco units at Purdue. His interface is a 4311 and there may be a signal strength
issue, but we are not sure.
My patch fixes ieee80211 without breaking the previous behavior.
