Right.  It doesn't solve the problem at all - I don't think
anything can ever solve the problem - if you define the problem
as being stopping bad apps from OOM'ing the system.  It needs to
be taken on a case by case basis - what is best for a given
system under certain conditions.
In my case, a 'dynswap daemon' would give me a larger window of
time in which to 'catch' an OOM situation and use human brain
logic to kill processes.  I could code the daemon to play a wav
file when a swap file is added, another when another swap is
added - increasing the 'defcon' number or alarmingness each time,
to warn me trouble is near.  In this case, I'd be not using up
disk space at all, because it is free space unneeded by other
things at the time - or I wouldn't configure it to use it, and
once the problem was solved - either by me stopping the rogue
process, and then the daemon downsizing swap accordingly, or by
OOM occuring eventually anyway.. I'd be left just having to kill
a swapfile off the disk.  The time it buys me during interactive
use, might be worth it for the times it works.  The kernel's OOM
killer just kicks in for backup.  A couple hundred extra megs of
swap, might even allow an app to complete what it was doing and
not OOM.  For example, if I had a dynswap daemon the other night,
and had it set up that it could add up to 400Mb of swap, I
wouldn't have OOM'd because midnight commander would have got the
150Mb it needed.  I believe the app to be designed poorly in this
case, rather than memleaking or buggy.  The OOM wouldn't have
occured, I could have grumbled, hit F10, and a few seconds to a
minute later - dynswap would have grabbed me back my disk space.
The more I think about it, the more I like the idea.  It could
even make swap space on non ext2 volumes if necessary.
I'm going to explore if anyone else has coded up such a program.

Various solutions are definitely needed, so that each particular
situation can choose the best-fit solution.  In my case, I think
both a dynswap daemon and a better OOM killer would be best.  On
a webserver or some other important machine, I'd likely side with
the existing setup, or one of the other proposed solutions like
bean counters, etc..
One thing is interesting is that a lot of people are working on
ideas to solve this.  That makes me happy for sure!
Take care,
