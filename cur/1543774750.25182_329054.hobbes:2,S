Sorry.  I completely misunderstood what you were getting at.  I thought
that you were implying that with the right kind of plugin, users would
be able to get around security measures.  Of course, this is probably
true, which means that plugins need to be coded carefully (as with
everything else in the kernel).  My point that I was trying to make was
that users can't install arbitrary plugins, and the set of plugins
available is controlled by the administrator.
Since that wasn't what you were talking about, I retract my previous
email.
