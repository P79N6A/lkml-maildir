Ok.. are we all ready? I had applied your development patches to all my vanilla 2.6.11-rc4-* 
kernels. Thus they all exhibited the same problem in the same way as -mm1. <Smacks forehead against

I had applied the patch to correct the looping resync issue with too many failed drives, and just 
continued and applied all the other patches also.
I have been unable to reproduce the fault using a vanilla 2.6.11-rc5-bk2 kernel.
Oh well, at least we now know about a bug in the -mm patches.
Regards,
Brad
