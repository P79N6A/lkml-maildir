The idea isn't to stop you from calling exec*().
The idea is to ensure that if you do execve("/usr/bin/foobar",...) that the
foobar binary hasn't been tampered with and you're not about to launch a binary
differing from what you expected.   Note that on a properly administered
system, this is a *high* level of paranoia, as the file permissions should have
prevented writing to the binary in the first place.  It's also a maintenance
nightmare waiting to happen, as you get to re-sign all the binaries every time
you install a patch, and it won't help prevent trojaned shared libraries...
