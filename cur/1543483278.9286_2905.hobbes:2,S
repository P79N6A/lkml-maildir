	I make a mistake fixing the pseudographics drawing and broke
possibility to have different translation on each console. Now I fix

	Yes, it is a real bug. And imho this must be fixed in 2.2 
I'll try to do something when I'll have enough of free time.

	I don't have a look at console-tools, but I think they are
similar. I just updated kbd package for new kernel. If you have some
wishes about it - write to me.
