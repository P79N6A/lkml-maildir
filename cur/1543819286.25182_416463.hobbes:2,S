Remember that this approach could effectively just move the indirection to
the TLB / page tables (well, I say "moves" because large kernel mappings
are effectively free compared with 4K mappings).
So be careful about coding up a large amount of work before unleashing it:
I doubt you'll be able to find a solution that doesn't involve tradeoffs
somewhere (but wohoo if you can).
