yup, thanks.
This is a somewhat general problem: a userspace process is in the IO path. 
Userspace block drivers, for example - pretty much anything which involves
kernel->userspace upcalls for storage applications.
I solved it once in the past by marking the userspace process as
PF_MEMALLOC and I beleive that others have implemented the same hack.
I suspect that what we need is a general solution, and that the solution
will involve explicitly telling the kernel that this process is one which
actually cleans memory and needs special treatment.
Because I bet there will be other corner-cases where such a process needs
kernel help, and there might be optimisation opportunities as well.
Problem is, any such mark-me-as-special syscall would need to be
privileged, and FUSE servers presently don't require special perms (do
they?)
