Can anyone answer this?
I am not sure if unnamed pipes in linux
are pageable or not.  If an unnamed pipe
could be paged out what could be done
to prevent that from happening?
TIA,
Mike

This would be a UNnamed pipe, i.e.,
	gen_confidential_data | gpg -e -r backup@pentacorp.com ...
The question is: is any of the clear text confidential data handled by the
unnamed pipe at risk for being written to disk?  Comments in the kernel
code suggest that it's buffered in a single physical page but I suspect
that it's actually a virtual page that could be paged out.
Does the answer depend on if gen_confidential_data limits its write to
not exceed PIPE_BUF (4096)?
Clearly, gen_confidential_data is subject to being paged out unless it
locks itself into memory.
THANKS!
Bob
