I am using a Mylex 170LP with no problem, running on a dual 550MHz 
MSI 6120S under quite a few 2.4.x kernels, lately 2.4.18 and 2.4.19pre5,
all under reiserfs.  The firmware is 6.00-15, carrying 6 9GB disks
(5 RAID5 + 1 spare).
There have been NO lockups under any version of the kernel, not under 
multiple bonnie runs.
What is your interrupt breakdown? Could your machine be doing something
naughty with the interrupts?
