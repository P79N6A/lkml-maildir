wow. I have Linksys wrt54g has 'ethernet switch' and my Snom 320 VoIP
phone still works when the mini network card goes down. On the other
side the wrt54g isn't exactly a switch but more like a bunch of network
cards which use the linux bridging code IIRC.

But this isn't related to my problen (on mac mini), is it?
