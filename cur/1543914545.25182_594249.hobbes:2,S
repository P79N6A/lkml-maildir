Subject: [patch] shared tag queue barrier comment

Should add some comments for the tag barriers (they won't be so important
if we can switch over to the explicit _lock bitops, but for now we should
make it clear).
Jens' original patch said a barrier after the test_and_clear_bit was also
required. I can't see why (and it would prevent the use of the _lock bitop).
