, elm3b132 is showing a similar error message for
the IPS driver on 2.6.21-rc2-mm1. There is no such device in the machine so
this is a normal error path for no devices found. The warning looks like
BUG: atomic counter underflow at:
 [<c027ccb4>] kref_put+0x7d/0x9d
 [<c02a4e38>] bus_remove_driver+0x36/0x41
 [<c02a5997>] driver_unregister+0xb/0x13
 [<c0286bdd>] pci_unregister_driver+0xb/0x13
 [<c04c653a>] ips_module_init+0x41/0x57
 [<c04b2bd2>] do_initcalls+0x58/0xf5
 [<c01353d5>] register_irq_proc+0x75/0x92
 [<c04b2c97>] init+0x0/0x8b
 [<c04b2ce0>] init+0x49/0x8b
 [<c01030ff>] kernel_thread_helper+0x7/0x10
This is essentially identical to the warning on ipw2200. It occurs whether
the driver is compiled into the kernel or as a module.  Reverting Mike's
patch fixes the problem - or at least the warning has disappeared.
However, I've cc'd the IPS maintainers so they can confirm they are
calling pci_unregister_driver() correctly. I note that many drivers in
drivers/scsi do not call pci_unregister_driver() in the module_init path.
ipw2200 also calls pci_unregister_driver() in the module_init path when
an error is encountered.
So, maybe this is an error in how the drivers use pci_[un]register_driver()
instead of a problem with Mike's patch?
