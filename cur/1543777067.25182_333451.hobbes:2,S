Sounds good to me, since different approaches to a problem are always
good, since it allows for comparing the plusses and minuses.  Not sure
if you want to take a crack using my ring buffers, but although they are
quite confusing, they have been fully tested, since I haven't changed
the ring buffer for a few years (although logdev itself has gone through
several changes).  I use the logdev device on a daily basis to debug
almost every kernel I ever touch.  When working with a new kernel, the
first thing I do is usually add my logdev patch.
Note to all:  The patch I posted is not the same patch that I usually
use (although the ring buffers _are_ the same), since I add stuff that
is usually more specific to what I do. So if something is broken with
it, I would greatly appreciate it if someone lets me know.
Thanks,
