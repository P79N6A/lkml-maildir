-Bob said that about his bios update fixing
the lockup problem entirely, but no doc,
needing no patch except to turn on ioapic
edge timer(another clue--without ioapic
edge timer working bios update fixed this
nforce2 situation!), no clue as to whether bios
update sets cpu disconnect one way or the other,
no opt to choose cpu disconnect in new or old
setup.
Jesse continues--
>>Last night, I updated the bios to the 12-5-03 released yesterday (see above).  I looked at the new option under Advanced Chipset Features, "C1 Disconnect".  It has three selections: Auto, Enabled, Disabled.  There seems to be no default.  The item help says:
>>"Force En/Disabled

>>Auto sounded nice, so I selected that first.  I compiled a new kernel without the disconnect off patch, or the ack delay.  These are the exact patches I used on 2.6.0-test11:
>>patch-2.6.0-test11-bk8.bz2
>>acpi-2.6.0t11.patch acpi bugfixes from Maciej.

Disconnect was ON!!!
> <snip>  ...one case the bios update fixed the problem
without needing cpu disconnect off, the other case we
don't know how or whether cpu disconnect is on or
off now but bios update fixed nforce2 without turning
ioapic edge timer on. I guess these two case prove that
neither cpu disconnect =on or ioapic timer =off are
causing the problem directly.

...and at least two motherboard makers have voodoo
to fix the problem.
