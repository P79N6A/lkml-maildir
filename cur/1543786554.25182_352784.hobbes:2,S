Umm, no one tried.  The last time it came up there was a healthy
discussion, but it stopped somewhere and no one followed up.  There
were two sets of patches from Jens and James and we need to arrive
somewhere in the middle.
That's exactly what I said above, people should stop bitching and bring
the patch up again - I'm pretty sure we'll find an acceptable variant
real soon.
