But how about inside the TiVO, so as to use Linux and the rest of the
GNU/Linux distro put in there for an even better DVR experience?
Sure, this might still be accomplished on another hardware platform.
But the TiVO already has all the hardware there, and you already have
all the software ready to work on it.  Except that you can't change
it.  You'd have to waste time and money just to get to the same status
on another hardware platform.
What do we gain?
