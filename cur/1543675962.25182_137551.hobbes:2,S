Thanks for your support.
The "USB legacy support" settings slipped through when
I was preparing the system. I was too much concentrated
on the ACPI/Fusion MPT problems...
But something must be wrong in this area, as the kernel prints
this "..MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC"
message when USB legacy support is disabled.
Anyway, I'll have this system available for tests in the
next few days (it is to be installed as production server
next week), and it _will_ suffer a lot from the stress tests
I've planned... ;-)
So if you want me to test anything (ACPI patches, perhaps?)
you're very welcome!
