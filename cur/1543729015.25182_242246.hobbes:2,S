nice. (What is the difference between the left-hand and the right-hand
graphs - why is the right-hand side one 'wider'?)

just to check this theory, could you make __check_and_rekey() an empty
function? This should still produce a working random driver, albeit at
much reduced entropy. If these latencies have a relationship to the
mlockall() issue then this change should have an effect.
