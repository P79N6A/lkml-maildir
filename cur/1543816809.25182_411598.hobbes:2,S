'cat' will issue a read for more bytes than your function provides. As 
this read isn't fully satisfied it will issue another read for the rest 
at a different offset, etc. So your function gets called several times.
Just do a 'strace' on 'cat' to see what 'cat' really does. For more 
details search for the thread 'procfs uglyness caused by "cat"'.
Your read function really shouldn't have side effects...
