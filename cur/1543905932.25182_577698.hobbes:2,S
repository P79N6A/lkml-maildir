Attila,
We had some issues with very similar boards all of the problems
seem to be around the PCIX bus area of the machine, setting the
PCIX buses to 66 mhz in the bios made things stable (but slow).   Not using
the PCIX bus also seemed to make things work.   We got MCE's and
other odd crashes under heavy IO loads.   I believe turning things
down to 100mhz made things more stable, but things still crashed.
Supermicro reported being able to fix the issue with:
setting the PCI Configuration -> PCI-e I/O performance
setting to Colasce 128B.
I am not exactly sure where to set it as we did not try it
as we had already changed to a different motherboard that did not
have the issue.
If this works please tell me.
                      Roger
