find_first_bit/find_next_bit don't actually suck. They're perfectly 
efficient for large bitmaps, which is what they were designed for (ie they 
were written for doing the free-block/inode bitmaps for minixfs 
originally).
In other words, they are meant for bitmaps of _thousands_ of bits, and 
for potentially sparse bitmaps.
Now, the CPU masks _can_ be large too, but commonly they are not. In this 
example, the "bitmap" was exactly two bits: cpu 0 and cpu 1. Using a 
complex "find_next_bit" for something like that is just overkill.

Yes. Almost ever "for_each_xyzzy" tends to be more easily written as a 
macro if we also have a ending condition.

Yes, except you'd probably be better off with testing whole words at a 
time, since a large NR_CPUs can often be because somebody wanted to 
support 256 CPU machines, and then used the same binary on a 8-way setup.
That would most helpfully be done with a double loop (outer one iterating 
over the bitmask words, inner one over the bits), but then it's hard to 
make "break" do the right thing inside the loop.
