Once you think it's ready, email me a URL to a single patch that adds 
the driver to the latest linux-2.6.git kernel.  Include in the email a 
description of the driver and signed-off-by line, which will get 
directly included in the git changelog.
Adding new drivers is a bit special, because we want to merge it as a 
single changeset, but that would create a patch too large to review on 
the common kernel mailing lists.
