Subject: premature closing of bugs in bugzilla.

Folks,
 Just because there's a resolution to a problem in bugzilla does
not mean you should close the bug you reported.  Wait until the
fix is accepted in Linus' tree before doing this, otherwise we
risk people forgetting to push bits.

Are two that I reopened, there may be others, I've
not yet looked..
