I've had it work on my main machine, which uses the Radeon framebuffer,
but on my laptop, which uses the VESA framebuffer, I get the same thing.
I might try again later using the NeoMagic framebuffer and see if the
fault still exists.  If it works on the laptop using the neomagic
framebuffer, that might point to a problem with the VESA driver.
This is with Linux 2.6.0-test1.  (I wasn't aware of the existance of
2.6.0-test2 until I subscribed to this list less than 24 hours ago)
