Haven't you done that already?  JFFS2 write behaviour is the best-case
scenario for any FTL.  When the delta cache is finished, LogFS will be
pretty close to that as well.
Not sure if anyone would specifically target FTL.  Being well-suited for
those beasts is just a side-effect.
The FTL is still a net loss.  Without that FAT enabling layer a real
flash filesystem would be more efficient.
