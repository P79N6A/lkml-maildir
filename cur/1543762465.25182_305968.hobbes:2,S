I'm not arguing against userspace validation, but if data produced
_is_ cryptographically strong, why revalidate it again?
I definitely prefer such mechanism to be implemented, and if you want,
it
can be turned by default off, and can be turned on using new ioctl() 
over /dev/random.

And how HIFN driver can contribute entropy?
It needs to create /dev/hifn_random, and rngd should be patched too?
And even using any existing crypto framework why add 2 kernel/user
copying, if we _want_ fast RNG and _know_ that it is valid?
You may say, that hardware can be broken and thus produces 
wrong data, but if user want, it can turn it on or off.
What about new ioctl() that will enable/disable entropy contribution
from kernelspace without validating it? I can create a patch on
top of David's.
