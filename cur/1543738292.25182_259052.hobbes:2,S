How do we describe the levels other than the first?  We'd either need
to:
1) come up with a language to describe the full tree.  For your example
I quoted above:
   echo "0,1,2,4,5 3,6 7,8;0,1,2 4,5 3 6,7;0,1 2 4,5 3 6,7" > partitions
2) have multiple files:
   echo "0,1,2,4,5 3,6,7" > level2
   echo "0,1,2 4,5 3 6,7" > level1
   echo "0,1 2 4,5 3 6,7" > level0
3) Or do it hierarchically as Paul implemented in cpusets, and as I
described in an earlier mail:
   mkdir level2
   echo "0,1,2,4,5 3,6,7" > level2/partitions
   mkdir level1
   echo "0,1,2 4,5 3 6,7" > level1/partitions
   mkdir level0
   echo "0,1 2 4,5 3 6,7" > level0/partitions
I personally like the hierarchical idea.  Machine topologies tend to
look tree-like, and every useful sched_domain layout I've ever seen has
been tree-like.  I think our interface should match that.
