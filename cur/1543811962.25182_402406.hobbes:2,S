I have put printk() statements all over the place. The hang (which is during 
boot time) occurs within the block of code that I sent you. There is a 
shm_unlock() statement after the code, but it is never reached.

Yes this looks like a good solution. I have changed VM_SHM in mm.h to be 
0x0800000 and am looking for a good place to include it in the 
vma->vm_flags. shmat() looks like a good place. How can I find the vma of a 
SysV shm in that routine?
