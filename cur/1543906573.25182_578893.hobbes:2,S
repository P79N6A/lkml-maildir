Ahhh -- the off by one error was inside my head!  Obviously if we allocate
bytes for offset 1000, len 100, then the affected byte range would run to
offset 1099, giving a file size of 1100 bytes -- that is (offset + len) --
not (offset + len - 1), which is of course the offset of the last byte.
Sorry for the confusion.

Thanks for catching that.
Okay -- it seems that this page is pretty much ready for publication,
right?  I'll hold off for a bit, until nearer the end of the 2.6.23 cycle.
Cheers,
