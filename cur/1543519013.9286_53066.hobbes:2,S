I had this problem on a digital workstation that had a dec2114x ethernet
card (tulip.o) on the motherboard...
When i loaded the tulip driver suddenly i got alot of "Resetting
transmitter" errors on the
other cards (all ethernet express 100).
It was kinda strange. I quickfixed it by shutting off the tulip card in bios
and just inserted an additional eepro100 :)
