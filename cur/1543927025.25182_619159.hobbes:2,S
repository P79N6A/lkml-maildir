I thought the timer code kicked the watchdog after waking up after a
long sleep anyway?  At one point I was looking into a mechanism to
temporarily disable the watchdog during a wait for a timer event, but it
got complex - and I thought - unnecessary.
Specifically this in kernel/time/timekeeping.c:
		/*
		 * When we are idle and the tick is stopped, we have to touch
		 * the watchdog as we might not schedule for a really long
		 * time. This happens on complete idle SMP systems while
		 * waiting on the login prompt. We also increment the "start of
		 * idle" jiffy stamp so the idle accounting adjustment we do
		 * when we go busy again does not account too much ticks.
		 */
		if (ts->tick_stopped) {
			touch_softlockup_watchdog();
			ts->idle_jiffies++;
		}
Or does this happen on the sleep path?  If so, wouldn't the right fix to
be this on the wakeup path?
