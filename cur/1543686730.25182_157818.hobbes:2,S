These strings are sometimes useful to maintainers when handling bug 
reports. Vendors and users often replace drivers with out-of-tree 
versions to gain features that aren't included in the in-kernel version 
(because of licensing issues, etc...). I have had this happen with ov511 
a number of times, so I add the "for Linux 2.4" now.
