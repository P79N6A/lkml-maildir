There should be no price.  And AFAICS that's doable.

autoconfig is completely separate story.  There are very good reasons to
avoid built-in/modular crap, regardless of the autoconf.  Every #ifdef MODULE
is a bug waiting to happen - simply because the stuff gets out of sync.
Every place that consists of
#ifdef CONFIG_FOO
	init_foo();
#endif
....
is a permanent source of PITA for out-of-tree drivers/patch merging/etc.
And that's aside of the fun with ordering, etc.
If we can get rid of performance hit on modular code - we should go
for that variant simply because it reduces the amount of bug sources.
Autoconfig and other details of ESR's Aunt Tillie fetish belong to
alt.sex.* - from time to time they may be amusing, but let's not
mix them with the technical arguments, OK?
