2.6 dropped this decoding because it was useless (doesn't offer
any additional information). Maybe that should be just done on 2.4
too.
It doesn't offer any additional information because we get
the CPU name from CPUID anyways and it is a long term
mainteance burden.

P.S.: The official Intel name for Prescott would be Pentium 4E 
(I don't know where to place the (tm) though)
