This vmstat output doesn't show any input / output happening. Are you 
sure this was taken *while* your test is running? If it is, then all 
files are already in pagecache. The fact that you have free memory at 
all times, and that the run on the notebook takes less than 20 seconds 
confirms this.
The second takes a lot more time to execute. The 1Gb memory does make me 
suspicious, though.
There is a known problem with BIOS that don't set up the mtrr's 
correctly for the whole memory and leave a small amount of memory on the 
top with the wrong settings. Accessing this memory becomes painfully slow.
Can you send the output of /proc/mtrr and try to boot with something 
like "mem=768M" to see if that improves performance on the Desktop P4?
