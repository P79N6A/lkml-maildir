See patch below.

but does not limit processes that are started from the boot scripts. So
if a buggy non-root service is exploited, an attacker would be able to
easily shut down the system.

I guess that "fork twice and exit" is worse than this?

It kills the process that reaches the limit (max proc's / out of mem)?

Limit the default maximum of user processes. If someone needs more, let
the sysadmin raise it (with ulimit -u, /etc/limits, sysctl.conf
whatever)
This should do the trick:
