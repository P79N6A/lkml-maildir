Of course. If it wasn't legal, dual BSD/GPL would just be equal
to GPL. Now, dual BSD/GPL equals BSD.

The actual licence conditions:
GPL or BSD or whatever.
Portions of this file were licenced under:
[the original licence text, not valid as a licence for current file]
WRT Atheros driver I'd probably leave the thing as is (i.e., BSD/GPL
