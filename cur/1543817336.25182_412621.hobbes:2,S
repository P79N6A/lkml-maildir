The use of
        smp_mb__before_clear_bit();
        clear_bit( ... );
is: all memory operations before this call will be visible before
the clear_bit().  To me, that's release semantics.
On ia64, we map the following:
#define Smp_mb__before_clear_bit      do { } while (0)
#define clear_bit                     clear_bit_mode(..., RELEASE)
Which looked perfect fine to me.  I don't understand why you say it does
not provide memory ordering.
