I don't disagree with the bug, but I disagree with the fix. 
In my opinion, the problem is that "info->nr_pages" is _wrong_. It's wrong 
because it has been initialized to a bogus value. 
I'd much prefer this alternate appended patch. Can you verify that it also 
fixes the problem (we can drop the bogus info->nr_pages initialization, 
because the context - including the info part - has been cleared when it 
was allocated, so nr_pages should already have the _correct_ value of zero 
at this point).
