I would suspect that it is actually looping inside the kernel, which
would mean that there indeed was no way to kill it.  You could try
alt-scrolllock on the console and see if you get a register dump of
it, or maybe one of the alt-sysrq magic keys might give you some
information.  But I suspect that rebooting is ultimately going to be
your only solution.
