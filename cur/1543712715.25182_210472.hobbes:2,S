you're right, I had a private email exchange with Andrew about this
yesterday, he promptly pointed it out too. But my point is that the
previous code was broken too, it wasn't me breaking the code, I only
simplified already broken code instead of fixing it for real. His tree
should get the proper fixes soon. All those __ in front of the
set_current_state in that function made the ordering worthless and
that's why I cleaned them up.
The softirq part in the patch however is orthogonal to the above races,
so I didn't post an update since it didn't impact testing.
