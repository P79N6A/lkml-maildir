   Ok, anyway, this fix just pretty much makes sure that
   when Null Encryption or any algorithm with a blocksize less
   than 4 is used, that the ciphertext, any padding, and next-header
   and pad-length fields terminate on a 4-byte boundary.
   I have tested it. Please let me know if all is well. 
Applied, thanks.
