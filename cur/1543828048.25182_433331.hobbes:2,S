Hi,
I have done some kernel programming with the kernel 2.4.19 and implemented 
some features which are required by some of our research projects.
(1) The first thing is you have to be good in C programming.
(2) Then you should know what you would like to do. Whether it would be an 
addition of new feature? or an improvement?
(3)At this place kernel code is available for cross-referencing and 
learning etc
  
http://lxr.linux.no/source/
(4) You can download kernel from 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/
What is your objective?
Thanks
