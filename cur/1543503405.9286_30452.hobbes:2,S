Okay, this one had me scratching my head for a good hour. I've got this
function:
#define NTFS_I(i)       ((struct ntfs2_inode_info *)((i)->u.generic_ip))
clear_inode (struct inode *i)
{
        struct list_head *entry;
        entry = NTFS_I(i)->i_attr_list.next;
        while (entry != &NTFS_I(i)->i_attr_list) {
                struct list_head *tmp = entry;
                entry = entry->next;
                printk(KERN_DEBUG "freeing attr %p from inode %p (%lu)\n",
                        list_entry(tmp, struct ntfs2_attr, a_list),
                        i, i->i_ino);
                ntfs_free_attr(list_entry(tmp, struct ntfs2_attr, a_list));
        }
        printk(KERN_DEBUG "kfree()ing inode %p (%lu)\n",
                i, i->i_ino);
        kfree(NTFS_I(i));
}
gcc-2.7.2.3 and egcs compiled it differently:
   gcc-2.7:                        egcs-1.1.2:
ntfs_clear_inode:               ntfs_clear_inode:
        pushl %edi                      pushl %edi
        pushl %esi                      %pushl esi
        pushl %ebx                      pushl %ebx
        movl 16(%esp),%edi              movl 16(%esp),%edi
        movl 176(%edi),%eax  <<    >>   movl 188(%edi),%eax
        movl (%eax),%esi                movl (%eax),%esi
        cmpl %eax,%esi                  cmpl %eax,%esi
        je .L897                        je .L1668
The differing line is obviously the equivalent of the NTFS_I macro.
Now, my kernel was compiled with 2.7.2.3, and the module compiled with
2.7.2.3 works. The one compiled with egcs doesn't.
Does this mean that the compilers are padding struct inode *differently*,
resulting in u.generic_ip being at different offsets? That's a nightmare :(
