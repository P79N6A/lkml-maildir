Not if correctly implemented.  The :thumbnail and :default streams
should be semi-independent of one another, and each should have their 
own size, blocks, etc.

That is, indeed, one method of implementing it.
The point of the NTFS-like streams is to allow programs to record
metadata on files they may or may not know the format of, and where
the formats may or may not support metadata.  For example, if KDE
wanted to keep icon and icon positional data for any given file,
it can keep it in something like .kde/<filename> or it can
write it to a stream outside the bounds of the file itself, yet
still bound to the file.  With streams, the file can be copied/moved
and the streams automatically go with it.

Apple's HFS has limited stream support in the form of the resource and
data forks.  The resource fork can be viewed as a collection of streams,
rather than just one.  A matter of POV.

No, not yet.  Then again, the vnode interface didn't appear until Sun
put it in back in 1985, which became the BSD VFS layer with 4.4BSD.
Now VFS is considered very unixy.
The big problem with it becoming unixy is that there's no API standard
or even semantic standard for it.  It'll probably happen much like
the VFS layer did: some large UNIX vendor will implement it and others
will copy/adadpt/evolve it.

Not yet.  I'm sure the SAMBA team will eventually put it in, tho.
