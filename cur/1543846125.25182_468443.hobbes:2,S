bug is back. Florin's patch _is_ right.
And installed, unless im getting confuzed.
To help me proove,
please consider this controll of flow:
	usb disconnect
	usX2Y_usb_disconnect() calls snd_card_free(card);
	snd_card_free waits:
		wait_event(card->shutdown_sleep, card->files == NULL);
	us428control starts exiting, closes /dev/hwC1D0, calls __fput.
	__fput calls snd_hwdep_release,
	snd_hwdep_release calls snd_card_file_remove.
	snd_card_file_remove sees lastclose is set, does
		wake_up(&card->shutdown_sleep);
lets assume, snd_card_free's thread prio is FIFO, we are on UP
and us428control' prio is not FIFO:
What keeps snd_card_free from waking up now, deleting /dev/hwC1D0's
file->f_op _before_  __fput is rescheduled,
seeing a set but freeed file->f_op?
Attached crash dmesg also has "BUG: time warp detected!", but that BUG
is propably unrelated.
