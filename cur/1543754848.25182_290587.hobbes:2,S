Current bitkeeper + latest swsusp2 patches and hostap driver, however, those
two don't come near touching the crypto stuff[1] so they're not really on my
suspect shortlist, but I'll see if I can find time to build a vanilla one
tomorrow (that is, without swsusp/hostap).. right now, it's time to sleep in
my local timezone..
Groet,

[1] hostap however does use some crypto algoritms, if I'm not mistaken, but
    its modules are not loaded in that stage of booting
