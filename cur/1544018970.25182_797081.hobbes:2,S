This one is my fault, I think I just cut-n-pasted the commit message
in my sleep,
and forgot to add my signoff.

Well I'm not 100% sure what happened for this patch, I suspect,
jbarnes sent patch a week
or two ago, it misapplied against the tree I had currently when
applied with git-am, it didn't work so I hand
applied the patch with patch and then did git commit
--author="jbarnes" as he did write it, I just munged it.
Now I'm unsure how I should best handle this, in a world where I can
devote a lot more time to
maintaining this, I would sent Jesse a mail saying, rebase, he'd reply
with a rebase and I'd apply it,
however I generally find it easier to just fix this stuff up on the
run as its synchronous. Should
I be specifying a date somewhere in the commit message?
Dave.
