And yet none of your benchmarks show noticable
improvements, which means that this micro-measurement
is totally unimportant in the grand scheme of things
as far as we know.
I'm not adding in a patch that merely provides some
micro-measurement improvement that someone can do a
shamans dance over. :)  If we're going to add this
new level of complexity to the TCP code we need to
see some real usage performance improvement, not just
something that shows up when we put a microscope on
a single function.
