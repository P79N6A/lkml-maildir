Where should I start? What FAQs, notes etc
I have downloaded the scsi specs (well chpts 6/7/8/16 etc)
I don't have enuf experience to interpret them yet.
But I have written a wee command interpreter using sg ioctls
that allows to me to set opcodes, luns etc and fire a command at a drive.
My problem is that I have a number (>10) of gubbed PD650's.
The problem is that the sector size (et al) info has been zapped.
Some nice person at panasonic took disks from me before and did some
wizzard mod.  The PDs came back - along with all the data that was
on them. [What am I saying, it is not a knackered disk just one in which
some management info has been overwritten.]
However Panasonic USA wont deal with me now.  And Panasonic UK do not
understand what I am saying.
How can I reset the geometry of a PD650 media?
Next:  These beasts are used under Linux.  ext2fs nothing fancy.
I have about 50 PDs, periodically the disk geometry just vanishes
from one of them.   The disk is then dead.  Why does this happen?
Is it linux?  Does it happen under windozes too?
