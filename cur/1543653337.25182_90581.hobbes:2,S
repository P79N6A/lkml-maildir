Are you saying you see no way of using the 'user pointer in struct epollfd'
to accelerate event dispatching?
For a perfectly good example of a use for it that has nothing to do
with pointers, consider the possibility that the structure could hold
a priority number. Sure the FD could be used as an index into an array
(taking up lots of cache memory, btw) or an index into a hash (more
expensive to process), but wouldn't it be useful to sort high priority
events before low priority events without having to dereference every
single fd? I would even tend to delay executing low priority events
until epoll_wait(0) stopped telling me about high priority events.
An opaque field gives me, the event loop designer, freedom. No opaque
field because a few event loop designers are convinced that it will be
used as a data pointer, and they believe this to be wrong, is a
limitation. epoll provides a very efficient alternative to poll. Forcing
epoll to look like poll somewhat defeats the purpose. I don't mind having
a bigger event loop, or two different event loops (one used when epoll is
available, and one used when epoll isn't).
