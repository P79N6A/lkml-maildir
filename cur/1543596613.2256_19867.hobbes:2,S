Yes, in Borland TurboDebugger under MSDOS. 
0 and 7 do nothing, 
1 power offs, but power led blinks and I was not able to get machine back 
  to life without unplugging power cord (it did not react to reset or 
  power button). Maybe when it is correctly suspended, or when there is
  running ACPI interpreter, it can return back to life, but not under MSDOS.
2 power offs and LED is off
3 did nothing and 
4-6 locked machine up just after outw(). Maybe it does something, but
  when tried from TD it just stopped react to anything (incl. poweroff)
  except reset button.
If bit 0x2000 is not set, it does nothing, and if you write random values
to SLP port, it somehow switches to another mode where it reads back
as 0x0000 and does not react to any outw values :-( Reset fixes this state...
I hope that I remember states 3-6 correctly, but at least two of them
are lockup, and at least one of them was nothing. But I'm 100% sure on
0,1,2 and 7.
