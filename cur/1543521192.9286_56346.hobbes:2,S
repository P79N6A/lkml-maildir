The e820 speck says that the 0x0e0000-0x0effff region is board specific.  I
believe that there really is available memory as reported on this machine.
I suspect, however, that Linux is not equipped to deal with available RAM in
the 0x0A0000-0x100000 region, and THAT is the problem.

   ... which is most likely the guilty party that's making your
   system die.
   Try the patch I've put on the lkml and see if that makes a difference
   (this is the memory detection part of the monster memory patch than
   Nathan Zook and I have been batting about for the past few weeks;
   one of the things it does is ignore e820 regions that live in the
   640k-1mb region, where several bioses cheerfully LIE and report
   exists.)
                 ____
   david parsons \bi/ and you've got a bios that politely sorts all the
                  \/             e820 regions.  How unfortunate that it
		                   should slip one little whopper on in.
