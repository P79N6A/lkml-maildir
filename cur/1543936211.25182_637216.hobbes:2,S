Close. But in this case #define DEBUG is already instrumented by the
subsystem-wide debug option if it's enabled, so it's preferable to use
that and just drop the special debug Kconfig option completely.
Take a look at how CONFIG_PCMCIA_DEBUG is handled.
With DEBUG()->pr_debug() conversion here you've silently dropped the
__func__ prefixing. Note that dev_dbg() is usually preferred when you can
get a hold of a struct device pointer, as it takes care of prettifying
the output with the driver name and so on, rather than the convention of
adding a prefix. If you can't get at the struct device pointer, you'll
probably just want to insert the __func__ prefixing manually at the
callsites.
