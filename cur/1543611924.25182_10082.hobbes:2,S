That's right -- and the devil would be in the incomplete/incorrect
details. Areas of special pain: (1) cross-directory constraints, (2)
derivations, (3) multiple port tree apexes.  These are all areas where
CML1 has design flaws that human coders get around by applying
higher-level knowledge of a kind a mechanical translator couldn't
have.
This is, alas, one of those cases where the first 90% of the problem looks 
easy and the last 10% turns ought to be nigh-impossible -- and the
first 90% is useless without the last 10%.
