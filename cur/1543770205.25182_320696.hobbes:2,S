There was a security hole in the CD burner support.  The Linux Kernel  
developers
fixed it quickly.  They were not planning to wait 6 months for you to  
get an
updated version of cdrecord out the door in any case.  If you want more
information on the Linux Kernel security policy, please see a recent  
copy of the
linux kernel for the file Documentation/SecurityBugs.  To quote the  
relevant
part:  "It is reasonable to delay disclosure ... or for vendor  
coordination.
However we expect these delays to be short, measurable in days, not  
weeks or
months."  Part of this policy includes "we'd like to know when a  
security bug is
found so that it can be fixed and disclosed as quickly as possible."   
This seems
to imply that the security team is not likely to wait 6 months to fix  
a critical
hardware-damaging vulnerability.

I will not debate this issue with you.  Please see the copious  
quantities of
emails when this issue was brought up a while ago.
