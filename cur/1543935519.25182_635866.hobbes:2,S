regardless of where the limitation is, the change is necessary.
however you wish to classify the issue, it doesnt matter to me.  the
Blackfin controller needs to declare the following capabilities:
 - 1-bit MMC
 - 1-bit SD / 4-bit SD
 - 1-bit SDIO / 4-bit SDIO
the existing framework is not flexible enough to account for this,
thus the patch posted.
> So, again, if you feel that there is a hardware difference between 4-bit MMC and 4-bit SD then please elaborate as it is my understanding that they are identical.
you may be 100% correct, i have no idea, i'm not really familiar with
MMC/SD/SDIO at all.
