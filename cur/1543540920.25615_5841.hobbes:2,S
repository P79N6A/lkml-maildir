Don't know if this is a bug or a "feature", but - under 2.4.0-test6-pre5,
when ripping an audio track using cdda2wav or burning a cd using cdrecord
under a SCSI-emulated IDE CD-RW or CD-ROM (HP 9110i & Acer 50X cdrom), the
system would only experience a very minor slowdown because of disk
activity, and around 20% CPU utilization. However, under -pre6, my system
experiences a major slowdown, and about 85%-100% CPU utilization, under
the exact same conditions - same version of cdrecord & cdda2wav, running
as root.
