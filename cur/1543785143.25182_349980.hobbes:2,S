This means inode->i_security was NULL. AFAICT it is only set to NULL in
inode_free_security() when the inode is freed. This shouldn't happen
while the packet is queued since the skb should hold a reference to
the socket on the output path. So it could be some protocol forgetting
to increase the refcnt when taking a reference. What kind of packet
is this? And what kernel version are you running? Until recently
ip_conntrack did some fiddling with skb->sk which could lead to
a packet on the output path with skb->sk set but no reference taken.
