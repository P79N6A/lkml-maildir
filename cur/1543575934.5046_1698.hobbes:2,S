I don't understand what you're talking about. Who ever talked about "more than
one label"?
The only issue here is having 1 random label at the end of a compound
statement. Nothing else.
And yes I can see that the whole point of the change is that they want
to also forbids this:
x()
{
	goto out;
out:
}
and I dislike not being allowed to do the above as well infact ;).
