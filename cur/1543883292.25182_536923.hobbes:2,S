I think so.  It makes it clear what's happening and it allows us to change
the implementation later on if the present trick stops working in later
gcc.  It also allows people to suppress the suppression (some have
expressed concern that it can hide real bugs).
But I lost (or didn't pursue) the bunfight^Wdiscussion last time this came
around.
