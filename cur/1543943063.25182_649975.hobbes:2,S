If you want to skip timer override on this board, this is a *NAK* from me. I 
told you the last time, it only works reliably here on MCP51 with timer 
override working. Even before Asus released a bios which had an option to 
enable the hpet, I needed the override or I got irratic behaviour. Since I 
got hpet enabled I gave up on arguing as the wrongly triggered quirk didn't 
bug me anymore.
IIRC my nforce2 needed the override. I didn't see that in the list.
