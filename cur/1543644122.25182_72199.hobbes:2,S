My personal estimation is that Debian will support kernel 2.4 in it's
stable distribution until 2006 or 2007 (this is based on the experience
that Debian usually supports two stable kernel series and the time between
stable releases of Debian is > 1 year). What is the proposed way for
distributions to deal with this?
