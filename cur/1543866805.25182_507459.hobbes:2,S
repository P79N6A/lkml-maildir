The 7500 issue isn't actually a race but a disease, if you mask a pending 
irq in its RTE, the PCI hub generates an INTx message corresponding to 
that irq. This apparently was done to support booting OSes without APIC 
support. So the following would occur;
- irqN pending on IOAPIC
- mask
=> INTx message for irqN
Unfortunately it appears the below code would also be affected by this as 
well, the appropriate reference is;
2.15.2 PCI Express* Legacy INTx Support and Boot Interrupt
