Right. Doesn't the latter result in more regular scheduling?

The daemon itself typically runs with a higher priority (and sleeps a
lot so it gets further dumped). More importantly, the daemon depends
not only on the latest measurement, but also on recent measurements
have been obtained from the hardware in a regular fashion and with
reasonably accurate timestamps. And *this* depends solely on the hdaps
driver.

Will this result in scheduling tha'ts as reliable as rearming timers
from softirq? I saw claims to the contrary, but it it's true then I
withdraw the first objection.

Recent versions of the hdapsd daemons do much more than a simple
threshold check: they gather some 2nd-order and decaying averages
statistics to catch subtle abnormal movement (e.g., sliding off a
surface) that's indicative of potential shock. As pointed out in IBM's
HDAPS whitepaper, by the time the box is actually in free fall, it's
too late to start parking the heads. Now, that kind of movement is not
very far from the noise floor, so hdapsd needs all the accuracy it can
get -- hence fuzzing is very disruptive. Calibration is currently
harmless, but I can certainly imagine more advanced hdapsd that uses
heuristics based, e.g., on the absolute orientation of the laptop, so
let's not ruin this data.

You could one input device open, or the other, or both. How would you
set up input-polldev to handle this?

BTW, I think that's worth fixing in any case.
