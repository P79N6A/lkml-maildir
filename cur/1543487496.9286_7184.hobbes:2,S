	It is interesting that you bring up this point.  I recall a 
few months ago a rumor that circulated that 'net claiming that Linus
had died in an automobile accident (much like John Romero's supposed death,
I guess).  The sources had no link to a news story to back it up, so 
I filed the e-mail into /dev/null. 
	It got me thinking though.. if Linus went away, (let's say he 
succumbs to the Microsoft marketing group and takes a job at MS), 
would the Linux project survive? The answer I came up with was a 
resounding "yes".  If a catastrophic event occurred to the project
back in 1992, when the developer base was relatively small and most
people did not have 'net connections at home (like myself), the 
project might have collapsed then and there.  
	But it's 1999, folks.  The Linux movement grows stronger by 
the day; it is slowly entering an "avalanche" phase where no matter
who leaves or what bad code is written, the project itself will survive.
We have at least 8 million people, the vast majority with net 
conections, who think Linux is a great idea and worth learning about
and developing.  The creative energies that drive Linux are 
infinite, outside the realm of a single person or group of people.

	Chances are very good that Linus has mastered the fine 
art of procmail-fu and places most mail directly to him into a folder
where he can later browse at his convenience.  If not, he'd be 
visually assaulted by scores of hatemail eminating from MS or Apple 
die-hards or countless "dude, you _really_ need my ada Roman numeral
converter in ur kernel" requests.  All in all, I agree with you - bounce 
ideas and let them filter out before sending them up the ladder.
