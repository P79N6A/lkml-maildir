Curiously, on a 1.7GHz P4 running RH7.1 (2.4.2 i686) it never hits
the same case, and takes slightly over a second to call gettimeofday a
million times.  On my 600MHz Celeron at home (66MHz FSB, i810) running
2.4.17 with a similar .config (I started with the RH7.1 config out of
the source RPM) it takes .8 sec for a million calls and successive calls
return the same value about 20% of the time.
