These asm instructions look wrong to me:
00 0c 08 --> add %cl, (%eax, %ecx, 1)
60	 --> pusha
Perhaps someone else overwrote random memory, and __switch_to crashed
later. Could you run
$objdump --disassemble-all --reloc \
	linux/arch/i386/kernel/process.o > dis.txt
and send us the disassembly of __switch_to?
And please attach the second oops as well.
