   I'm also having trouble with NFS, with a 2.4.22-pre6-ac1 server.
   I'm booting a diskless workstation (with a 2.4.21-ac1 client), and
it will boot and mount the root filesystem. When I try to mount any
other filesystems, the client reports
mount: can't get address for vlad
and loses the main NFS mount: attempts to access any file on the root
filesystem gives stale NFS file handle errors. The failure to mount
also breaks the server -- I can no longer boot the diskless client.
Restarting the NFS server allows me to boot the client once again.
   Like Meelis, I'm also using Debian unstable, and I've tried with
both the 1.0.3-1 and 1.0.5 versions of the nfs-tools on both machines.
Both versions give the same error that I reported above.
   Hugo.
