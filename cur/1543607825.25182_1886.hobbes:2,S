I'm not planning to use bonding on my notebook any time soon.
But what I meant was bonding's use of ARP to determine whether the 
connection is good (or rather, bad, even when the link is up), when 
the connection is routed via level 3. Seems to me you'd need a level 
3 protocol (say ICMP) rather than ARP.
