I'm running with a patch that printk's if cpu_idle() is called while a
softirq is pending.
If I access the floppy on my K6/200 every track triggers the check, and
sometimes the console blanking code triggers it.
What about creating a special cpu_is_idle() function that the idle
functions must call before sleeping?
