Ouch.

XFS used to have synchronous truncates, for similar sorts of reasons. 
It was dog slow for unlinks.  They worked pretty hard to fix that; I'd
really like to avoid adding extra synchronicity to ext3 in this case.
Pulling buffers off the transaction more aggressively would certainly be
worth looking at.  Trouble is, if a truncate transaction on disk gets
interrupted by a crash, you really do have to be able to undo it, so you
simply don't have the luxury of throwing the buffers away until a commit
has occurred (unless you're in writeback mode.)
