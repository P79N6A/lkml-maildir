Which is quite reasonable, e.g. echo more >>file
By the way, for completeness, I should maybe point out that something
like this existed also for Linux. It was called "IFS" (Inheriting File

was never fully debugged. In fact, it was so bad that even its author
admits that it was the wrong approach:
