Actually, I would think that get_vm_task_id(void *addr) would be a  
more useful interface.  The call would still be a relatively simple  
lookup to find the struct file associated with the particular virtual  
mapping, but it would be race-free from the perspective of userspace  
and would not require that we somehow figure out the file descriptor  
associated with a particular mmap() (which may be closed by this  
point in time).  Useful extension would be the get_fd_task_id(int fd)  
and get_fs_task_id(const char *path), but those are less important.
The other important thing is to ensure that somehow the numbers are  
considered unique only within the particular domain of a container,  
such that you can migrate a container from one system to another even  
using a simple local ext3 filesystem (on a networked block device)  
and still be able to have things work properly even after the  
migration.  Naturally this would only work with an upgraded libc but  
I think that's a reasonable requirement to enforce for migration of  
futexes and cross-network futexes.
Even for network filesystems which don't implement coherent shared  
memory, you might add a memexcl() system call which (when used by  
multiple cooperating processes) ensures that a given page is only  
ever mapped by at most one computer accessing a given network  
filesystem.  The page-outs and page-ins when shuttling that page  
across the network would be expensive, but I believe the cost would  
be reasonable for many applications and it would allow traditional  
atomic ops on the mapped pages to take and release futexes in the  
uncontended case.
Cheers,
