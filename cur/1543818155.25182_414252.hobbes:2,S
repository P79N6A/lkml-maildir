If some kind of automatic load balance is the focus, then extending the
notion of a CPU package for multicore processors sharing the same cache
controller and memory would be a better track to take. I saw this in the
-mm tree over a year ago an I haven't looked at the scheduler code recently
to see if it made into the mainline. If the RT load balancing is to be
extended, it should take into consideration whether the migration of a
thread should go to a core that's closer or farther away in terms of
memory hierarchy instead of just grabbing the first non-RT task running
CPU and hijacking it to run that RT task.
