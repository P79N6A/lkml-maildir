+4) Multiple cards
+--------------------------
+
+If you happen to be running multiple cards, it would be advisable to load
+the bttv module with the card id. This would help to solve any module loading
+problems that you might face.
+
+for example, if you happen to have a Twinhan and clones alongwith a FusionHDTV5
+card
+
+	$ modprobe bttv card=0x71 card=0x87
+
+Here the order of the card id is important and should be the same as that of the
+physical order of the cards. Here card=0x71 represents the Twinhan and clones
+and card=0x87 represents Fusion HDTV5.
+
+Some examples of card-id's
+
+Pinnacle Sat		0x5e
+Nebula Digi TV		0x68
+PC HDTV			0x70
+Twinhan			0x71
+Fusion HDTV5		0x87
+
+For a full list of card-id's, you can see the exported card-id's from
+bttv-cards.c in linux-2.6.x/drivers/media/video/bttv.h
+If you have problems with this please do ask on the mailing list.
