(When reporting ext3 problems, please specify the journalling
 mode - it makes a rather large difference).
I'll assume it's data=ordered.   If you're using data=journal
then please don't - it's not working very well in 2.5.15.
These patches:
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.5/2.5.15/ext3-no-steal.patch
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.5/2.5.15/sct-jbddirty.patch
Will likely fix it.  Please let me know...
