I am wondering on the status of sound drivers for the newer Yamaha sound 
chipsets.
I have a laptop with the Yamaha YMF-744B chipset in it. (The Sony Vaio 505ve 
to be exact.)  Checking the 2.3.30 kernel, I see it is not supported as of 
yet. (Unless I am missing something.)
Is someone working on this chipset at the moment?  Is it overlooked? Do they 
need docs? The current docset for this chip and a number of others can be 
found at 
http://www.yamahayst.com/pcaudio/download/index.htm
 . The docs appear 
to give enough information to do a driver, but I am not certain not having had 
to write one.
The chipsets listed on that page are:
PCI Sound Chipsets:
 YMF724F
 YMF740C
 YMF744B
 YMF754
Codecs:
 YMF752
FM Sound Generators:
 YMF289B
Wavetable generators:
 YMF721
ISA Single Chip Audio
 YMF715E
Audio DAC:
 YAC516
Hopefully this information is of some use.  I would like to get sound working 
on this little box. ("It's waffer thin!") At least to stop badly written apps 
with sound from coreing.
I am willing to help test drivers for the YMF744B chipset, if that will help.
Thanks!
