Can You check /proc/net/rpc/nfsd which shows how many NFS requests have
been retransmitted ?
# cat /proc/net/rpc/nfsd
rc 0 27680 162118
  ^^^
This field means the clinents have retransmitted pakeckets.
The transmission ratio will slow down if it have happened once.
It may occur if the response from the server is slower than the
clinents expect.
And you can use older version - e.g. linux-2.4 series - for clients
and see what will happen as older versions don't have any intelligent
features.
Thank you,
Hirokazu Takahashi.
