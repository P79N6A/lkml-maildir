Kernel command line: BOOT_IMAGE=Linus-git-old ro root=302 video=vesafb:mtrr:3,ywrap,1024x768-24
That's not the string from the non-bootable kernels of course, but the
only difference is the image name. (yes, I've tried without the
`video=...')

It looks similar, but I'm seeing different symptoms.  I don't see any
errors, and earlyprintk doesn't print anything.  The machine just
reboots after lilo outputs `BIOS data thing'.
