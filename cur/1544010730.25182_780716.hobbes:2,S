performance governor itself will not change the frequency.

2201000 is the marketing speed of your processor, plus 1MHz.
This is used by the ACPI BIOS to enable "Turbo Mode",
aka Intel Dynamic Acceleration Technology --
which gives the harware license to run faster than
2.2GHz if the conditions are right.
ie. when there is still no idle time available at 2.2GHz,
ondemand chooses 2.21 Ghz, and the HW may give it more...
The right conditions depend on the part -- could be that
some cores need to be in deep idle to let other cores
go fast, or it could be based on current and thermal
constraints, or both.
I have a 2.0 GHz T61, and I'm unable to reproduce
your observation.
You can eliminate turbo from the picture by
echo 2200000 > time_in_state
and that will tell us if turbo is related to your
occasional obervance of low-frequency-mode.
You can also observe the temperature in
/proc/acpi/thermal*/*/temperature
