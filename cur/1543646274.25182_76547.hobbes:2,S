The 'socket protocol' stuff already copes with UDP w/ congestion
control + TCP. It will eventually do SCTP and IPv6 when we get down to
it all.
Fitting UDP w/ sequencing+acking as an extra protocol should be
possible, and in fact support for sequencing is needed anyway for
the security code in RPCSEC_GSS.
The nice thing about the SunRPC code is that it provides a generic
engine for sending and receiving messages asynchronously. For the
client, the SunRPC specific stuff is almost all in
net/sunrpc/clnt.c. If you write a replacement for that in order to
deal with the RxRPC quirks, you should still be able to make use of
rpciod and the socket + auth code.
Ditto for the server stuff: nobody forces you to use svc_process to
interpret the RPC headers.

The RPC layer doesn't worry too much about the contents of the data
you send. We're already interpolating pages into our RPC messages...
