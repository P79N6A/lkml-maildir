Subject: [PATCH] 2.5 kernel_stat access in KLM

Hi *,
I need to access system, nice and idle-time of the system from a 
KLM. But due to the 
fact, that this structure is not exported any longer towards any KLM, 
those values are 
unusable.
Was there a particular reason not to offer the kernel_stat-structure 
any longer to 
KLM's? I've made a small patch and the KLM can access the 
information needed:
Is it possible to add this patch to the kernel? Thanks!
Kind regards,
-Ralph.
