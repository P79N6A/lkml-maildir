I'm going to assume that there's no way for ext3 without extents
support to mount such a filesystem, so I think this means changing the
FS name. Is there a simple migration path to extents for existing filesystems?

Similar questions here.

You might also mention that on-disk format issues such as endian
layout are not finalized.
