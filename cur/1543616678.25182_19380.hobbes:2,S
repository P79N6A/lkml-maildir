I don't consider kernel compilation as a developer-only activity:
we certainly don't expect Aunt Tillie to compile kernels, but it's expected 
almost every server admin will want/need to do it.
Keeping two versions of GCC (one for 2.4 kernel, other for everyday use) is 
something I don't like. Imagine what we will have around New Year 2003: 2.5 
is still devel, 2.4 is stable, GCC 3.1+ is out and stable. Most people will 
be glad to have 2.4 compilable by GCC 3.1 IMHO.
The fact that kernels compiled with GCC 3 are _bigger_ than ones compiled 
with 2.96 is really annoys me. Will keep an eye on this as GCC 3 stabilize...
