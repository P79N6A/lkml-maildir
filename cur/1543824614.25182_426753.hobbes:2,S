I'm sorry, but I do not understand. Care to explain a bit more, maybe
with some examples?
Also, I get the impression that you dislike my patches. I'd like to work
with you and the community to merge my patches, but for that to happen
I'd appreciate if we both kept the language on a professional level.
Next time, please try to avoid strong words such as "abuse", "horrible"
and "ridiculous".
Thanks,
