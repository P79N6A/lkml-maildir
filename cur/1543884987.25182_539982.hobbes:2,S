Ok.  Although we can hoist the bss zeroing, if everything needs it.
Are you booting with P=V now?  If not I expect you will run
into trouble if you set CONFIG_RELOCATABLE.

In essence this is ok.  I would like to do the research to see if we
can perhaps just remove the segment reload.  Short of that we should
at least be able to remove the unnecessary preprocessor test for
CONFIG_PARAVIRT.
Hmm.  I'm wondering about the segment reload and how much of a problem
that is.  My memory says that segment reloads are not actually a
privileged operation, so we may be able to support this even in
paravirt mode.  How hard would that be to support?  The segment
we reload is a fixed part of our boot protocol.
Anyway something to research.

I guess this works.  You don't handle the old case of set_sectors == 0
but I guess you don't support any kernels where that is the case.
