Hi,
just noticed these on the console:
Restarting system.
APIC error interrupt on CPU#0, should never happen.
... APIC ESR0: 00000000
... APIC ESR1: 00000040
APIC error interrupt on CPU#1, should never happen.
... APIC ESR0: 00000000
... APIC ESR1: 00000040
hope it gives some clues to you (you know who you are :)
Tigran.
