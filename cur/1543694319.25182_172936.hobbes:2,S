This leak is at least a couple of months old.
The recent (test7) /proc oops was fixed when Linus reverted the
job-control-in-signal-struct patch.
This leak is of size-4096: it isn't kernel stacks.
I did a quicky audit of all kmalloc(PAGE_SIZE) instances and everything
looked OK: one suspect in the NFS server but I wasn't able to force
speedier bloat by exercising the NFS server in my normal usage pattern.
I'm thinking we need to stuff builtin_return_address(0) into the object and
write a dumper, but I haven't looked into that.  Maybe I can persuade
Manfred to cook up a custom patch to do that?  Just for size-4096?  Something
really crude will be fine.
