I'm not arguing against a distributed model. I'm arguing against a
distributed SHM model, because of it's seductive nature, and because
MPI and similar message passing models solves the class of problems
you refer to quite well.

I didn't say I was locking everything in sight, nor that I support
locking all over the place. But locks are good because they are cheap,
and can be used wisely in that context. If suddenly the ground shifts
under you and locks are no longer cheap, the you have to ask the
question: does it mean locks were always a bad idea, or is the fault
with the foundations.
Let me express it another way: locks are known to be cheap, so they
can be used in certain ways. Don't implement slow locks because they
were never meant to be slow. Implement something more appropriate.

Not true. Having one CPU write to one half of a page and another write
to the other half of the page is fine with SMP. It's only a problem if
have them both writing to the same cache line.
So, here's a legitimate case where SMP works well, but DSM falls over
in a heap.
