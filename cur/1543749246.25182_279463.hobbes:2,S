Hi,
I'm experimenting on stock kernel 2.6.8
I was looking for an interface that could directly receive data from a
network socket, WITHOUT coying from kernel space to user space. (Like for
sending data, "sendfile" provides to send data to network socket without
copying it to kernel space). I came across tcp_read_sock() interface in
net/ipv4/tcp.c.
Has anybody tried tcp_read_sock()?? Is there any known issue with it ?? If
somebody has some idea, I would appreciate if you can share.
I might be wrong, but what I perceive is that I will pass a pointer to this
function. And when the function returns, I expect it to be set to the kernel
buffer (corresponding to socket).
1) To fulfill this objective, I expect to pass a pointer to pointer & only
then it can be done. (If we have to modify a pointer's value, we have to
pass its address ... Right??). However, this function expects a char * buf
(in read_descriptor_t argument). Any ideas ?????????
2) This code also frees the space allocated to sk_buffs etc using
sk_eat_skb(sk, skb) and cleanup_rbuf(sk, copied) etc. But this function is
supposed to return these locations to the calling code ... Right???
Any pointers are more than welcome. I have provided the code for reference.
Please cc the reply to me as I'm not on the list.
Thanks & regards,
Rajat Jain
