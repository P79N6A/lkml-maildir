Apparently, Windows Longhorn will include something called "transactional
NTFS". It's explained pretty well in
   
http://blogs.msdn.com/because_we_can/
Basically, a process can create a fs transaction, and all fs changes made
between start of the transaction and commit are atomical - meaning nothing
is visible until commit, and if commit fails, everything is rolled back.
Sound useful... Although there are no service pack installs that could fail
in Linux, the same thing could be useful in rpm, yum, almost anything. 
What do you think?
