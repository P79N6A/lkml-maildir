While Andrew and -mm are taking a bit of a break...
I've uploaded a patch file of the libata PATA working tree versus
2.6.20-mm2 to
	
http://zeniv.linux.org.uk/~alan/IDE
2.6.20-mm2-ac1 has the cable detect method, the identify slave first
change, and assorted core cleanups to methods like ->set_pio_mode() that
were deferred due to the number of things they touched.
The current -ac1 tree I would class as "unstable", its a work in progress
having done all the merging and updating but not yet enough testing to
shake all the bugs out
