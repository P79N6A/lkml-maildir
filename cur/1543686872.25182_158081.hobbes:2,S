Patch set:
	
http://patches.arm.linux.org.uk/pcmcia/yenta-20030817
*
	The tar file contains all patches.
This is a patch set aimed to cleaning up the yenta controller quirks,
working around some of the warts which have appeared (eg, overwriting
of yenta_operations init pointer.) and adding better power management
support.
Unfortunately, since my laptop continues to have an argument with the
2.6 kernel APM, I am unable to properly test the suspend/hibernate/resume
functionality.
yenta-20030817-1-zv.diff
	Use #defined constants for TI ZV initialisation
yenta-20030817-2-override.diff
	Clean up yenta overrides - move the quirks to the main
	PCI ID table, and list the quirks by type.
yenta-20030817-3-sockinit.diff
	Move socket initialisation to the quirk table.
yenta-20030817-4-pm.diff
	Add per-quirk power management (to aid saving/restoring
	controller specific state.)  Also, add proper pci state
	saving/restoring.  Note that Cardbus bridges have to
	save and restore at least 0x48 bytes of configuration
	space, not 0x40.  WIBNI pci_save_state/pci_restore_state
	took "start, length" parameters...
yenta-20030817-5-pm2.diff
	Remove PM restore from socket initialisation; less reason
	for socket initialisation to vary between controller types
	now.  In fact, we could very well get rid of much of the
	TI-specific socket initialisation quirk handling, since
	TI realised that they should be more compatible with other
	implementations in later versions of their bridges.
yenta-20030817-6-init.diff
	Move re-initialisation from the socket init/resume paths to
	where it belongs - the main initialisation path.
yenta-20030817-7-quirks.diff
	Move more controllers to the more advanced quirks.
