Subject: How to use kernel_thread()?

I don't completely understand how to start kernel threads using
kernel_thread().  Especially the flags are a problem. Yes, I do read
the sources a lot, but I don't understand task management completely
yet.
I need a thread that will run completely in kernel context and will not
exec() or whatever.  In the USB drivers there are a few instances of
kernel_thread, but they CLONE_* a few things and then disable them
again in the thread (like MM, files).  Elsewhere in the kernel threads
are spawned with zero flags.
So
- What flags should I use? 
- What initialization should I do at the beginning of the thread? 
- How do I cleanly exit the thread?
- I guess I can't fork a thread in interrupt context (in the case I
  would not want a permanently running thread), can I?
