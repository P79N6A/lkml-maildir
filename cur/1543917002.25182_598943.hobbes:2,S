This sounds ok...

Is foo() called from too many different places? If so, are you
interested with only the invocation of foo() from a specific callsite?

I am not too sure... single-stepping a "call" instruction from a
different memory location (single-stepping out of line) requires some
fixups and kprobes handles such fixups just fine (see resume_execution()
in arch/<arch>/kernel/kprobes.c)
You could try a a couple of approaches for starters.
a. As you mention above, a kprobe on the function invocation and the
other on the instruction following the call; both need just pre_handlers. 
b.
- Insert a kprobe and a kretprobe on foo()
- The kprobe needs to have only a pre_handler that'll measure the latency
- A similar handler for the kretprobe handler can measure the latency
again and their difference will give you foo()'s latency.
<b> though will require you to do some housekeeping in case foo() is
reentrant to track which return instance corresponds to which call.

PS: There was a thought of providing a facility to run a handler at
function entry even when just a kretprobe is used. Maybe we need to
relook at that; it'd have been useful in this case.
