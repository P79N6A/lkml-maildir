Don't know if someone else mentioned those but I only said 0xed. That's the 
value Phoenix BIOSes use (yes, and which H. Peter Anvin) reported as being 
generally problematic as well).
It's in fact not all that unexpected it seems that port 0x80 responds to in 
given that it's used by the DMA controller. It's a write that falls on deaf 
ears. The read is going to be faster if it doesn't timeout on an unused port.
Although it's not faster for everyone, such as for me indicating that for us 
port 0x80 is really-really unused, it is for many. See results here:

Yes, so it seems. In this case we could in fact also "fix" your situation by 
just going to 0xed depending on for example DMI. Alan Cox just posted a few 
further problems with a simple udelay() replacement...

At 800 MHz, that's 1.79 / 0.99 microseconds. The precision of the "in" is 
somewhat interesting. Did someone at nVidia think it's an "in" from 0x80 
which should get the 1 microsec delay?

Unused ports, bus timeouts.
