2.5.67 works with framebuffer console, 2.5.67-mm1 dies before activating
graphichs mode on two different machines:
smp with matroxfb, also using a patch that makes matroxfb work in 2.5
up with radeonfb, also using patches that fixes the broken devfs in mm1.
I use devfs and preempt in both cases, and monolithic kernels without module
support.
2.5.67-mm1 works if I drop framebuffer support completely.
Here is the printed backtrace for the radeon case, the matrox case was 
similiar:

sysrq worked and let me reboot.  No filesystems were
mounted at this point.
