C1 is essentially suspend on hlt.  We have something called Automatic Hardware
Clock Gating that kicks in when the blocks go unused, so that saves a bit
more power (especially in the south bridge) then we would with just a simple
hlt.  In any event, this already happens without the assistance of ACPI.
The 5536 has support for a C2 state as well, but I don't know if that
has any effect on the GX or not.
