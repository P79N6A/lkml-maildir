I agree. See it more as 1) preempt is "interesting", 2) it is not clear that
netpoll will show what one expects when networking issues come into play
(netpoll locking had to change recently). It would be nice to narrow the
issue within the fs/block subsystem.

Some may toast me but I'd avoid preempt on a production machine.
