In 2.5.50 i am completly unable to get my keyboard to work.  I have selected the input device->keyboard support, but nevertheless it just doesn't work.  The machine operates fine, as in the daemons all work, just no keyboard working.  
1) This is probably a stupid stupid stupid user error.
2) I have been playing with this for the past 4 hours trying different options.
3) I am baffled.
4) Sorry if this isn't the right place for this.
