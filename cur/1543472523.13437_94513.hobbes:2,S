IPv6 routing          Several good algorithms are prohibited.
compression           Arithmetic encoding (bzip), MPEG, audio, GIF...
encryption            Idea, RSA, some kinds of key exchange...
color management      The gimp can't do it. Damn.
filesystem updates    We can't do delayed ordered writes.
OSPF                  The IETF is not happy with this one!
quality-of-service    Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) QoS
register allocation   Ever wonder why VC++ code can beat g++ code?
PPP                   Can't return a useful error code to the other side.
drivers/net/zlib.c    Must use code with nonlinear time requirements.
That is from memory + grep. Actual research would show many more.
I'd say this is definitely hurting us. Of course, we have nothing
to trade for access. If the FSF isn't willing to trade patents,
maybe one of the Linux distributers would take the role.

Most computers ship with a WinModem and 3d accelerator.
Many have undocumented printers and sound cards.
Try this: walk into a consumer-oriented electronics store and buy the
first PC you see. Laptops are even better. Run Linux on it.
