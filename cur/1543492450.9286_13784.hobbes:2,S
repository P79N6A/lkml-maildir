Yeap, and this is an example of code that should be removed from the
kernel and put into a daemon (yes I'm volunteering, just as soon as I have
the time to do it).

People interested in modems should pick up a textbook on digital signal
processing (look at the reading materials for graduate courses in
electrical engineering).  I'm in the middle of the learning curve on the
way to writing a modem, and it's a hell of a lot easier that I thought it
was -- hint: everything in signal processing surrounds multiply
accumulate.  Fourier transforms, bandpass filters, equalizers...  My jaw
is still dropping! =)
