IMHO problem with OOM killer is that it always will do wrong choice. So,
it should be either plugin based or allow to configure it and this
means, that it will become more complex and buggy. Does not it mean,
that OOM killer should be moved to user space?
How about to export OOM event to user space? It might be done in manner
like hotplug script is used.
