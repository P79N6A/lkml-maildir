Yes, Lee needs to chill a bit.  I'll hopefully explain our position 
calmly enough below.

The tradeoff is a realistic 4.4% power savings vs a 300% increase in the 
minimum sleep period.  A user will see zero power savings if they have a 
USB mouse (probably 99% of desktops).  On top of that, we can throw in 
Con's disturbing AV benchmark results (1).  As a result, some of us 
don't think 250HZ is a great tradeoff to make _for_the_default_value_.

 From what I can tell, tick skipping works fine right now, it just needs 
some cleanup.  Thus I'd expect something like it will get integrated 
into 2.6.14.  If it gets in, the default HZ should go back up to 1000. 
In that case why decrease it for exactly one patchlevel?
As an app programmer, it'd be nice not to have to support 2.6.13 
differently from 2.6.(x!=13).  For my app, busy waiting means a ~12% 
load increase for 2.6.13 compared to (probably) all other 2.6 kernel 
versions.  That's certainly violating the principle of least surprise. 
Up to now, it was easy enough to tell people "upgrade from 2.4.x and 
it'll work better".  Now it gets more complicated.
Finally, as a conspiracy theorist, I wonder if Linus is just playing us 
to get more people working on the tick skipping and highres timer 
patches.  Someone with the ability to herd cats obviously has to be 
sneaky.  As an impressive demonstration of my free will I'm going to go 
test dyntick on my VIA Epia board...
