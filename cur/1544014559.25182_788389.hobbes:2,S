So you refuse to dump if in_execve is set?

There is already a security_bprm_committed_creds() hook.  So you
could  hook abort_creds() and prepare_exec_creds(), and use them
to set a flag in your tomoyo task->security state.  Is that what
David nacked in favor of this flag?

It's ugly, you can't get me to say it isn't ugly :), and it sets a scary
bad precedent.  But if David insists (in a reply to this msg) that this
flag really is tops, then just ignore me.  Anyway my point wasn't to
block the patch but to raise discussion (so someone else could decide to
block it :) on both the flag and security implications of these
semantics.
