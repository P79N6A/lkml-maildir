Hello Riley,
First, I would like to apologize for the tone of my message to you.
It was over the line as a personal attack.  I think your *patch*
was very bad, and I want to point that out to you, but I could do the
same thing in a calmer way.
Would you please test your work a little more than that last patch?
A stitch in time saves nine here.  It saves a lot of people a lot of
time in the long run.

As a matter of fact, I do, and you have a copy.
Run mconfig on it, any mode.  It's imperfect but in this case it would
have told you "syntax error" right away.
But there is another, better way.  Read the Config.in files.  If you
work on Config.in files, you have to know there are three interpreters,
and they are written in different programming languages with different
parsers.  And *none* of them have static syntax checking.  So you have
to stay very close to the campfire because there are a large number of
rattlesnakes in this forest.
If you can't find other uses of "-n", then don't use it.

Yes, that is the comment.  It means that if you turn on CONFIG_PCI_GOBIOS,
then you get the following output:
    CONFIG_PCI_GOBIOS=y
    CONFIG_PCI_GODIRECT=n
    CONFIG_PCI_GOANY=n

Can you please check that again?  I am totally sure that Configure and
Menuconfig produce "=n" lines, not "# is not set" lines.  I am also very
sure that xconfig works this way, too.
If you have any kind of .config file with "# is not set" for a choice
list, I would like to see it, because that shouldn't happen in 2.1.XX.

I proofread it.  I don't have time to test it today.
The Config.in section looks fine, except that the 'unset' line isn't
going to work in xconfig.  Actually, except for the 'unset' line, it
identical to the patch I posted yesterday morning.  :)
We do need help text, but I don't think the help text needs to talk
about the internal options.
