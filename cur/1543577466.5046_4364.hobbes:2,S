I don't remember 2.2.0 being this well tested... I seem to recall it
having a huge list of known bugs at the time too.
2.4.0 seems to have come with much better bug tracking and the time was
spent fixing those bugs.
Some of the servers I ran at the time wouldn't stabilize until 2.2.7 ..
I'm betting on things going much more smoothly (though I won't know
for sure since that company lost it's ability to afford me ;) )
