The PPro local apic documentation says:
<<<<<<<
The processor's local APIC includes an in-service entry and a holding
entry for each priority level. To avoid losing interrupts, software
should allocate no more than 2 interrupt vectors per priority.

Ok, we must reorder the vector numbers for our own interrupts
(0xfb-0xff), but that doesn't explain our problems: we don't loose
reschedule interrupts, we have problems with normal interrupts - and
there we only use 2 irq at the same priority level.
Btw, the kick patch I sent a few minutes ago revives my io apic.
