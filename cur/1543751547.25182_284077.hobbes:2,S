Why is that clear? In just about every respect, realtime audio has the
same characteristics as hard realtime, except that nobody gets hurt
when a deadline is missed :) We have an IRQ source, and a deadline
(sometimes on the sub-msec range, but more typically 1-5msec) for the
work that has to be done. This deadline is tight enough that the task
essentially *has* to run with SCHED_FIFO scheduling, because doing
almost anything else instead will cause the deadline to be missed.

OS X's deadline scheduler is arguably better, though I don't believe
it can actually offer the guarantees it claims to with 100%
reliability. But they are essentially do hard realtime via deadline
scheduling, combined with a task killer for any RT task that exceeds
its stated cycle consumption.
To do that in Linux would be great, but its really an addition to the
current scheduling mechanisms, not a replacement. The OS X realtime
task (its actually a Mach RT thread, to be more precise) can still
theoretically cause DOS *if* the kernel task killer was not present,
so its just the task killer that would be needed, presumably driven by
the timer interrupt.

i guess we're suggesting almost the same thing, except that i consider
this to be hard realtime plus a task killer, not "soft realtime
pretending to be hard realtime" :)
