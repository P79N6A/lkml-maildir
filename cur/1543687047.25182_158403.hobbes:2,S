        I have written a watchdog timer driver for ALi M6117 chipset
(included in some SBC and PC/104 (i386) motherboards) for Linux
2.4.x. This driver is written according to WDT API (watchdog-api.txt) and
works very  well.
     You can find it in:
http://www.iar.unlp.edu.ar/~fede/pub/kernel/alim6117_wdt.tgz
and I am interested in people which test this module. I dont have any
problem to maintain and fix it.
Best regards,
