Folks,
I was playing with 2.5.66-mm1, and I noticed that my wireless card was not
working on bootup (Orinoco card).  This card has worked fine in 2.5.65 and
in various other -mm series kernels.
I attempted to to restart pcmcia, and it resulted in a panic.  I'm
attaching a copy of dmesg and the .config file I used to compile the
kernel.  If there's anything else you need, please let me know.
