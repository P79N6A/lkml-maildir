2.5.44 booted fine with root=/dev/hda5 on my laptop (one ide disk, all
ext2).
2.5.46 stopped at VFS cannot blah blah "hda5", after reading the
partition table fine.
I got 2.5.47 to boot (gave up on 2.5.46) by using the
root=/dev/ide/../part5 param instead.
Yes, it took me a week to think of that.
There was no change between configs except what make oldconfig
threw up to make a decision on (and I always say no).
Choice selections from config ..
  ...
  # CONFIG_HPFS_FS is not set
  CONFIG_PROC_FS=y
  CONFIG_DEVFS_FS=y
  # CONFIG_DEVFS_MOUNT is not set
  # CONFIG_DEVFS_DEBUG is not set
  CONFIG_DEVPTS_FS=y
  # CONFIG_QNX4FS_FS is not set
  CONFIG_ROMFS_FS=m
  CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y
  CONFIG_EXT2_FS_XATTR=y
