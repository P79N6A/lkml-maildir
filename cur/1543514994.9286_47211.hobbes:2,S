   For "find" style operations where you simply want a list of names (plus
   `-type d' tests), a speedup is possible without any kernel/user API
   change.  Do you remember the patch to speed up `open (fn, O_DIRECTORY)'
   by avoiding inode reads for non-directories?  Your tune2fs feature is
   the step that makes that patch effective.  I will try it on a real
   filesystem soon, and see how much faster treescan runs.
P.S.  It would be good to make the user code check the de_type field
returned from readdir(), and not try the open(fn, O_DIRECTORY) call if
de_type is set.  That way, it will be ready for when we get the full
readdir() implementation done, since while the open(O_DIRECTORY) is a
neat hack, it still involves a system call which could be avoided if we
passed the information back in readdir().
