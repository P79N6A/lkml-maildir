Have been quite busy, and I regret I haven't tried a rc kernel in
awhile, but, this bug has gone un-fixed still.. Thought I'd throw in
another "heads up"..
2.6.22 hang:

Pentium-D 830 3.0GHz Dualcore on a ASUS P5LD2 with latest bios rev.
1804.
SysRq does not work when this locks up.
Patches, info, things to try, anything is welcome, I am available for
awhile now and will try anything to get this working.
Cheers,
