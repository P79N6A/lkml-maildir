Ingo,
        That fix is not correct. Pavel Emelyanov posted a
correct fix to netdev earlier today. Apparently, the context
matched ipv6_getsockopt() in the split version, but those
changes belong in compat_ipv6_getsockopt(), as in Pavel's
fix.
        Since the original patch was correct, I'm not sure
if the fix will have the same problem or not.
