Why not?  The config system is changing so much between 2.4 and 2.5
anyway, so any re-organisation like that might as well be done in one

Oh, except that we are in a feature freeze :-), but that doesn't seem
to have affected anything else.  Infact, I think the current state
should be called a
"feature latent-heat-transition-between-melted-and-frozen".
