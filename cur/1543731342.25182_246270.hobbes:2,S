  At  least  I  as  a user see the benefits largely. The workstation /
  desktop  user has much more need for such features, than perhaps the
  normal Linux sysadmin.

  Indeed.  But  you forget one thing. Combining lots of small userland
  tools can actually make things more complex - at least for the user.
  That said, I do not see that anyone has suggested to remove this way
  of  working with applications.
  Are the new and old features mutually exclusive?

  There  are  many  uses already. It could be encryption, compression,
  meta-data,  file streams, sorting, searching and a multitude of uses
  and ideas that haven't been discovered yet.

  I,  as  a  user, have for a long time. Do not drag everyone over the
  same  edge.  Users  have  different  needs.  We  should try to be as
  forthcoming as possible to provide the tools and options for them.

  Why  do  you say this? I thought Linux embraced advancements and new
  technologies.

  Exactly.  The  problem  I see in this discussion is the lack of just
  this - APIs. Because the lack of good APIs we cannot make any larger
  changes or bring new features because old applications will break.
  I think that Linux should make new API that will completely separate
  applications  from the storage media. This way we will not as easily
  break  applications  when new features are developed. This should be
  the main priority.
  Perhaps  over a transition period the old ways will be allowed while
  applications  are  ported  to  the new APIs. The change is certainly
  going  to be needed at one point or Linux won't be able to evolve as
  quickly as its users are demanding it.
  Application  breakage  has  happened  before between virtually every
  kernel change. It isn't new. Just take devfs and sysfs.

  It  is easy to say this. But the fact is that users can actually use
  these new features for good things.

  If  I  want  to  be able to quickly find files by a certain author I
  could   search  the  meta-data fields (if they are used) with normal
  tools such as grep.
  Compression or encryption is another example.
  Would  you  rather  patch  every  application  there is for Linux to
  enable support for reading these files and directories?
