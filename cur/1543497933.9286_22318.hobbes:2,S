For load balancing or because of provider throughput problems in one
direction, some ISPs send outgoing traffic via some particular set of
providers or provider connections.  This can result in the fastest "in" path
being different from the fastest "out" path.  TCP/IP doesn't care, and in
fact TCP/IP routing is so dynamic that two consecutive packets may take
completely different paths between the same two hosts.
