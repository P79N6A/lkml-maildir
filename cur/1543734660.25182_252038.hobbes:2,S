That expectation can't be entirely relied upon, as the restrictions may
not be predictable.

This kind of error reporting is better still, as the fields then won't
be polluted with invalid data under any circumstance (assuming the code
can report subsets of the fields or some such, which I presume to be
the case given that avoiding reporting potentially computationally
expensive fields was one of the original motivators of the patch).
