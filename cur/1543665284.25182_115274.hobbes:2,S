Hello!
   I am still playing with improving memleak detector thing from smatch project.
   Seems there is a memleak in fs/binfmt_elf.c::load_elf_binary() in current 2.5
   If setup_arg_pages() fails (line 638 in my sources) we do return but 
   not freeing possibly allocated elf_interpreter (line 520) and 
   allocated elf_phdata (line 500) areas.
   Is this looking real? At least it looks real for me (I am trying to get
   number of false positives way down).
Bye,
    Oleg
