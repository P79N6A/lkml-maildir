Debugging.  When a new Linux user files a "no sound" ALSA bug report I
need to find out whether they have any known broken options enabled,
like USB bandwidth checking or the OSS USB midi/audio drivers.  If we
have to go back and forth figuring out which distro they have and where
the config is they are that much more likely to give up and go back to
Windows.
