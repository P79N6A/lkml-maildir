Good code thanks for the pointer.
When I searched months ago, there wasn't anything out there.
Safte polling in the kernel isn't inherently bad and could be tied into 
the hotplug mechanism.
Making SAFTE hotswap available via SG would also work but system 
performance would be bad at small poll intervals (like 100 msec).
Thanks
