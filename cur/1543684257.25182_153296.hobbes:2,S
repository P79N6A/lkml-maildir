Doesn't; it showed up in a 'grep' that I should have examined
more closely.  Sorry!  But both swsusp and APM have the "using
both registration schemes" issue (consistency matters here).
Why does it seem like a bug -- because it's using only the "new"
infrastructure, while there are still a few drivers that only
register to the old one?  I'd rather see those drivers (about
a dozen) have compile time #ifdef CONFIG_PM #warnings, and call
them the bug...
