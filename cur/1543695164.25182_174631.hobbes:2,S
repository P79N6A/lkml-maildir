Hi, 
Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt on 2.6.0-test8-bk says: 
"Compiling modules outside the official kernel
---------------------------------------------
Often modules are developed outside the official kernel.
To keep up with changes in the build system the most portable way
to compile a module outside the kernel is to use the following
command-line:
make -C path/to/kernel/src SUBDIRS=$PWD modules"
However, trying this yields: 
"make[1]: Entering directory `/home/muli/kernel/linux-2.5'
*** Warning: Overriding SUBDIRS on the command line can cause
***          inconsistencies
make[2]: `arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.s' is up to date.
  CHK     include/asm-i386/asm_offsets.h
  Building modules, stage 2.
/home/muli/kernel/linux-2.5/scripts/Makefile.modpost:17: 
*** Uh-oh, you have stale module entries. You messed with SUBDIRS, 
/home/muli/kernel/linux-2.5/scripts/Makefile.modpost:18: 
do not complain if something goes wrong. 
  MODPOST
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/muli/kernel/linux-2.5'
What is the correct way to build out of tree modules? if there isn't a
correct way, any pointers on how to go about adding support for it? 
Thanks, 
Muli
