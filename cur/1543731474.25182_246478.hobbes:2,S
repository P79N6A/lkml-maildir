this is genuine NTFS overhead.
the 1 msec events you get because the timer fires once every 1 msec, but
this is not irregular. There is a single NTFS function running, which is
profiled nicely by the timer IRQ:
 00010001 0.372ms (+0.372ms): do_IRQ (load_and_init_upcase)
 ...
 00010001 1.374ms (+0.981ms): do_IRQ (load_and_init_upcase)
 ...
 00010001 2.376ms (+0.978ms): do_IRQ (load_and_init_upcase)
 ...
 00000001 2.615ms (+0.216ms): vfree (load_and_init_upcase)
to be able to debug such latencies is one reason why i changed the
do_IRQ() trace-entry to show the interrupted function's name. (it
wouldnt normally, mcount() doesnt reach across IRQ frames.)
load_and_init_upcase() is called by ntfs_fill_super() which is called by
the mount code, which runs under lock_kernel(). It seems NTFS does not
rely on the BKL - could you try the patch below, does it solve the
latency?
