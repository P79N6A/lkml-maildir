As mistakes go, I think mine is a pretty acceptable one.
The general trend for config.in files is to place drivers AFTER core
system management and build configuration items.  My patch follows that
trend.  Maybe a better fix-up patch would be to properly place
comment/endmenu stuff instead?

But drivers can easily be dependent on power management, which is a more
low-level and core interface than paralle ports, which is a "mere"
driver...

First and foremost, let's talk about the current kernel.  Your point #2
implies that text needs to be changed somewhere, but nothing more than
that.  The ACPI driver depends on the kernel power management
facilities, plain and simple.
If you want, rename CONFIG_PM to CONFIG_SYSMAN, for "system and power
management," so to be more proper.  As I stated in the patch sent to
Linus and others, native power management drivers and other options are
going to start appearing under CONFIG_PM, which was the reason for the
CONFIG_PM question addition.  For example I'm hacking on the i430FX
motherboard (PIIX1 PM), which has a shitty APM implementation and no
ACPI support at all.  That will appear under CONFIG_PM when complete.

I am not really worried about someone losing 0.02 seconds of
productivity because they had to hit 'Y' one more time during kernel
config... :)
