Hi all,
i am running a 2.6.4 kernel on my system , and i am playing a little bit
with kernel time issues and helper functions,just to understand how the
things really work.
While doing that on my x86 system and loaded a module from LDD 3rd
edition,jit.c, which uses a dynamic /proc file to return textual
information.
The info that returns is in this format and uses the kernel functions
,do_gettimeofday,current_kernel_time and jiffies_to_timespec.
The output format is:
0x0009073c 0x000000010009073c 1116162967.247441
                              1116162967.246530656        591.586065248
0x0009073c 0x000000010009073c 1116162967.247463
                              1116162967.246530656        591.586065248
0x0009073c 0x000000010009073c 1116162967.247476
                              1116162967.246530656        591.586065248
0x0009073c 0x000000010009073c 1116162967.247489
                              1116162967.246530656        591.586065248
where the first two values are the jiffies and jiffies_64.The next two are
the do_gettimeofday and current_kernel_time and the last value is the
jiffies_to_timespec.This output text is "recorded" after 16 minutes of
uptime.Shouldnt the last value be the same as uptime.I have attached an
output file from the boot time until the time the function resets the
struct and starts count from the beggining.Is this a bug or i am missing
sth here???
