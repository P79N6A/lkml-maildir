Are you trying to do line graphics portably here ? If so you want
The ACS_* symbols (see man curs_addch)
I don't think this is anything to do with the kernel. We output however many
bits the tty port is set for. The consoles are a VT emulation with switches
to use PC extensions depending on what font set is loaded.
