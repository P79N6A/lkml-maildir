Hi All,
I am trying to apply the patch for "metafile option" for cramfs-1.1.
I am getting the following error,
patching file 'mkcramfs.c'
patch: **** malformed patch at line 4: * mkcramfs - make a cramfs file system.
I am getting similar error while applying the other patches posted in the URL.

Can anyone tell me what is the cause for this error?
Thanks
Vanitha
