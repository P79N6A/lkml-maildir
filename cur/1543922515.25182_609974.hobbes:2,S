I'm now testing crash on 32bit, but there is an issue before
applying the patches. My machine stopped at checking 'hlt'
after kexec, showing below message.
CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 3.80GHz stepping 0a
Checking 'hlt' instruction...
v2.6.23.1 works fine for 1st kernel.
I'm investigating it..
Thanks
