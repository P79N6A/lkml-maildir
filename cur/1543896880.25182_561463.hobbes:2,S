AFAIK it should be possible to get it to work on non-x86.  One would
have to implement the IO functions for x86emu and mmap the Video BIOS,
both of which should be relatively easy tasks.  I don't however have 
direct access to hardware other than x86(_64) and thus haven't had a
chance to write such code and test it.
Best regards,
