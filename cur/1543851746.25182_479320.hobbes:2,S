We might use an hybrid approach : Use a percpu counter if NR_CPUS <= 8
#define refcount_addr(zone, cpu) zone[cpu]
For larger setups, have a fixed limit of 8 counters, and use a modulo
#define refcount_addr(zone, cpu) zone[cpu & 7]
In order not use too much memory, we could use kind of vmalloc() space, using 
one PAGE per cpu, so that addr(cpu) = base + (cpu)*PAGE_SIZE;
(vmalloc space allows a NUMA allocation if possible)
So instead of storing in an object a table of 8 pointers, we store only the 
address for cpu0.
