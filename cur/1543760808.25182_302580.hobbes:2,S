Yes, that's a big global lock, protecting global resources.  I always
expected it to hit someone's fan, but it never did.

An fsync/O_SYNC-intensive workload on a ram disk is likely to bring it out,
yes.  But once one has real disks under there, the acquisition frequency
will fall a lot.
Unless people are being all shy again, I don't think anyone has hit
significant inode_lock problems on more real-world things.
