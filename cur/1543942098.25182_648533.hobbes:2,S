Using spin_lock_irqsave() is what rtc_get_rtc_time() does which was
used before I changed to get_rtc_time() does. So it should be ok. I
missed that difference. However, I agree with you the whole RTC
"emulation" per HPET is a bit unclean. However, I have too little
experience in this code area to come up with a proper redesign. I just
ported it from the old RTC to the new RTC module interface.

Yes. I must admit that I didn't know that document. I used
checkpatch.pl, but that's of course only for coding style. I'll try to
follow the points in SubmitChecklist in future.
