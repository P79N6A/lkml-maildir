	Hi;
	Using 2.6.10... (this hasnt happend under previous kernels,
but I cant swear as to the last one I burned a dvd under.)
	I too had a strange thing happen when I just tried to burn a
dvd with growisofs. First, it didnt work as non-root. (failed
with unable to set MODE, no dmesg) So, I became root, and it burnt all
right. But then the media wouldnt eject when I hit the eject
button. As a regular user I used the 'eject' command, but it
failed. I ran 'eject' as root, and it claimed to fail, but
actually ejected the disc.
	We see this in dmesg:
program eject is using a deprecated SCSI ioctl, p lease convert it to SG_IO
scsi: unknown opcode 0x1e
	After this, though is when things get odd. Xine failed to play
any dvd in the drive-- well, it would play the menu intro, but fail when
you clicked on a title. mplayer did better, but bombed out when I tried
to seek, and the drive refused to eject the disc after using any of 
these programs by hitting the manual button, but required root to run
the 'eject' command. No dmesg errors.
	I rebooted and things work as expected with xine and mplayer
on the dvd drive now. I dont know if the burning process was responsible
for messing up the drive state, or if it was possibly that I had 
previously used the pktcdvd driver... since I notice that there was
a kernel pktcdvd thread running previously, and not now. I wish I
had thought to tear down the pktcdvd association before rebooting...
	Anyway, Ill probably burn another dvd soon, and see what happens.
