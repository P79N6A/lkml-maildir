Actually fourteen syscalls and counting, and some of those have `mode'
arguments.
It's a fat, complex, presumably arch-specific, presumably frequently-changing
API.  So whatever we do will be unpleasant - that's unavoidable in this case,
I suspect.
(hmm, the interface isn't versioned at present - should it be?)
Maybe, perhaps, one day it _should_ be a syscall API.  But right now if we
did that it would become a versioned syscall API with obsolete slots and
various other warts.
I get the feeling we'd be best off if we were to revisit this in a year or
so.
