In the relevant documentation "throttling" usually means "the reduction of the
frequency of a CPU that is not idle" in which case it won't (at least on the
average).

You can't use less power, you only can use less energy. :-)
Anyway, that's "the reduction of the frequency of an idle CPU" mentioned above
and it makes sense in the majority of cases.
