Subject: [PATCH] stub MADV_FREE implementation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/7/405

Until we have better performance numbers on the lazy reclaim path,
we can just alias MADV_FREE to MADV_DONTNEED with this trivial
patch.
This way glibc can go ahead with the optimization on their side
and we can figure out the kernel side later.
Signed-off-by: Rik van Riel <riel@redhat.com>

When I get back from the Red Hat Summit (Saturday), I will run more
performance numbers with and without the lazy reclaiming of pages.

Politics is the struggle between those who want to make their country
the best in the world, and those who believe it already is.  Each group
calls the other unpatriotic.
