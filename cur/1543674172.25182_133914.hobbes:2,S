Sure.

No need.  As long as there is no NDA, which there isn't when
you get a cd bundled with the thing.  Restricted source then
mean that you can't edit it so it fits your kernel and
redistribute.  But you can read it and see how the thing works,
if (1) is satisfied.  Then you use your knowledge and write
a driver from scratch.  More work, but legal.
Of course a completely free driver is even better. :-)
