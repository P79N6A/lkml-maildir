Does it really?  Solaris just uses special devices which are managed by 
vold.  You open /floppy/floppy_id/whatever or /vol/dev/whatever, reads and 
writes are associated with the special devices (not the physical device), 
and when vold needs to access the physical device it notes what media is 
currently in it and if necessary requests a media swap.  vold then accesses 
the physical device on behalf of the virtual device.
This is essentially the block-device version of ptys and screen.

    We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
