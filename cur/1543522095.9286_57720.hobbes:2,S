Hello!
   After I started to use RTL8139 in 100 Mbit mode I started to get this
   under heavy traffic:
eth3: RTL8139 Interrupt line blocked, status 4.
eth3: RTL8139 Interrupt line blocked, status 4.
eth3: SMP simultaneous entry of an interrupt handler.
eth3: RTL8139 Interrupt line blocked, status 4.
This is
eth3: SMC1211TX EZCard 10/100 (RealTek RTL8139) at 0xe800, IRQ 16, 00:e0:29:33:f1:97.
There is also rtl8029 card on this same irq.
Box is Dual P3-450 with 2.2.14 kernel
Linux ccssu 2.2.14 #1 SMP Tue Jan 11 18:14:07 EET 2000 i686 unknown
gcc 2.7.2.3 compiled.
Should I worry about such messages?
Bye,
    Oleg
