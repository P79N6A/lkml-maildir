Not so much the kernel. When compiling the kernel I'd prefer not to waste time 
and space compiling the 100+ modules I will never ever use on my laptop. I'd 
prefer for something to select the modules necessary for my hardware. I can't 
afford the time to keep up to date with that's new and what isn't, what has 
changed, what has been superseded, which module works with which device, 
chipset even, etc...
