What other purposes do you see the performance counters useful for? To collect 
information on process characteristics so they can be scheduled more efficiently?
Is this going to require sharing the nmi interrupt and knowing which perfcounter 
register triggered the interrupt to get the correct action?  Currently the 
oprofile interrupt handler assumes any performance monitoring counter it sees 
overflowing is something it should count.
