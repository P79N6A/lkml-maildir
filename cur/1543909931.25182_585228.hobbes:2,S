Hmm, it's not bad style at all.  Let's assume that everything
is in the same scope.  Such a loop must either call a function
that busy-waits, which should always have a cpu_relax or
something equivalent, or it'll call a function that schedules
away which immediately invalidates any values the compiler might
have cached for the atomic_read.
Cheers,
