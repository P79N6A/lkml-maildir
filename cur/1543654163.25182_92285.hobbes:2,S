[ snip long bits ]
a while back giacomo catenazzi (probably spelled wrong) hacked up some
goodies to autodetect what hardware driver options are appropriate for
your system, based on contents of various bits of /proc.  i haven't
heard anything about it in quite some time but it sure seems like this
would be the most appropriate tool for cases like yours.
i believe it generated a baseline .config with appropriate things
enabled; having done that you then went through menuconfig enabling
other things you wanted, like filesystems, non-autodetect-able hardware,
etc.
