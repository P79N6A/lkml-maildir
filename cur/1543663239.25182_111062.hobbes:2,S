Hi All,
  I want to use tcp_sendpage to send data from one end to another. But 
tcp_sendpage accepts data in the form of PAGE. But in my application I have 
data in iovecs form. Is there a way I can convert data in iovecs form to 
PAGE form so that I can feed it to the tcp_sendpage ?
Thanking You
Shesha
