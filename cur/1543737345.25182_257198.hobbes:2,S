No, why is that. One can restrict memory on a task and by doing so waste 
  cycles in paging. That does not mean we should get ride of memory 
restrictions or a like.
Loosing cycles is simply an observation of what could happen.
As in any system, over constraining a given workload (wrt to affinity, 
cpu limits, rate control) can lead to suboptimal utilization of 
resources. That does not mean there is no rational for the constraints 
in the first place and hence they should never be allowed in the first 
place.
