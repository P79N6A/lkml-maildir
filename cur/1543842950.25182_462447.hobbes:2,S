There should be some cost when you do atomic inc/dec accounting and
locks for add/remove resources from any container (including default
resource group). No?

I think it will be preferable to not change the existing behavior for
applications that are running outside any container (in your case
default resource group).

For the cases that put this don't care, do you depend on existing
reclaim algorithm (for memory) in kernel?

If the limits are set appropriately so that containers total memory
consumption does not exceed the system memory then there shouldn't be
any QoS issue (to whatever extent it is applicable for specific
scenario).
