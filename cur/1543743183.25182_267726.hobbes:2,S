attached my .asoundrc
What I did, I halfed the buffer_size from 8K to 4K. After that it worked
fine.
I really don't know why that is.
my soundcard acording to lspci is:
0000:00:1f.5 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corp. 82801CA/CAM AC'97
Audio Controller (rev 02)
        Subsystem: Sony Corporation: Unknown device 80fa
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 0, IRQ 9
        I/O ports at 1c00 [size=256]
        I/O ports at 18c0 [size=64]
but I know there is a yamaha chip behind, because in windows xp, I use
yamaha drivers.
