Hello,
I haven't heard about it on x86_64 discuss list so I thought it is worth 
asking if someone else has encountered this. When I boot 2.6.8.1 kernel 
(patched with kdb) the last thing I see is:
Freeing unused kernel memory: 160k f
I don't get the whole word "freed", only the first letter "f". This is SMP 
kernel. I will try recompiling without kdb and also booting as "nosmp" to 
see if it makes any difference.
Fedora Core 2 smp kernel boots fine, btw.
Kind regards
Tigran
