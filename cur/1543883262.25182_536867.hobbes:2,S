Bugzilla has an email interface.
Andrew forwards bugs from Bugzilla to developers.
There might be small room for improvements, but I don't see how 
man-power or technology could make a big difference in this area.

"*once* you've found and gotten the right developer involved" is the 
real problem, not how to track bugs.
And not only a developer active in this area, more important a 
developer who knows the subsystem/driver involved *and is willing
to work on bug reports*.
*This* is *the* problem.
And no change in bug tracking will help with this problem.
