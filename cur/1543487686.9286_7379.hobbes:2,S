$ cat /etc/debian_version
2.0
$ vlock --version
vlock version 1.0
$ vlock --help
vlock: locks virtual consoles, saving your current session.
Usage: vlock [options]
       Where [options] are any of:
-c or --current: lock only this virtual console, allowing user to
       switch to other virtual consoles.
-a or --all: lock all virtual consoles by preventing other users
       from switching virtual consoles.
-v or --version: Print the version number of vlock and exit.
-h or --help: Print this help message and exit.
$ who am i
bx3!t107234  tty7     Feb 27 12:39
$ (sleep 2s; chvt 8)& vlock -a
=> all VTs locked; chvt blocked somehow
$ chvt 8; vlock -a
=> vt changed to 8 & tty7 locked so that if anyone changes to tty7 then
the entire console will be locked... sick? ;)
