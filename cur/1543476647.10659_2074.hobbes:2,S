Hello everybody,
My compile (gcc 2.7.2.3, Binutils 2.9.1.0.19, ld.so 1.9.9) always fails
with the following error message:
[snip]
make -C  arch/i386/lib
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.2.0-pre6/arch/i386/lib'

There was a previous thread on a similar topic (also concerning
checksum.c), where it was suggested that checksum.c may not be handled
correctly by old versions of patch. I therefore upgraded to patch 2.5, but
the problem persisted.
The error occured with different .config setups, I attach the one I think
is the most stripped down setup still usable for me.
I hope this info is helpful, contact me if you need more.
PS: Please cc me as I'm not on the Linux-Kernel list, just a lurker :-)
Thanks for your excellent work,
Gregor

Dear Lord:
        I just want *one* one-armed manager so I never have to hear "On
        the other hand", again.
