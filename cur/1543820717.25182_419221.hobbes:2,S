Sorry, you do not know the language, and your statement is not 
credible. I think that C sucks.

Statement expressions are working fine in g++. The main difficulties are:
    - GCC's structure member initialization extensions are syntax
      errors in G++: struct foo_t foo={.member=0};
    - empty structures are not zero-sized in g++, unless they are like
      this one: struct really_empty_t { char dummy[0]; };

G++ compiling heavy C++ is a bit slower than gcc. The g++ front end is 
reliable enough. Do you have a particular bug in mind?

A lot of C++ features are already supported sanely. You simply need to 
understand them. Especially templates and type checking. C++ 
exceptions are not very useful tool in kernels. Static constructor 
issue is trivial. I use all C++ features (except exceptions) in all 
projects: Linux kernel modules, embedded real-time applications, 
everywhere. They _really_ help a lot.

I think that allowing C++ code to co-exist with the kernel would be a 
step forward.
