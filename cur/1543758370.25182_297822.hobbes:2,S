Thanks David, the CVS code works great with the small excpetion of the following change to
get it to build.

What's the deal with the broken firmware for monitor mode?
  * v0.15rc1 -> v0.15rc2 - 28 Jul 2004 - Pavel Roskin & David Gibson
  *      o orinoco_pci saves PCI registers on suspend (Simon Huggins).
  *      o Monitor mode disabled on Agere 8.xx firmware - it's broken.
I have 8.4 but things seem fine (used this card in monitor mode for over a year without
problems).
I just disabled the check for broken firmware and things seem fine (better than the original
patch I posted). The iwlist command now works. Could the buggy firmware be generalized a bit
too much? Perhaps only certain versions > 8 are buggy?
