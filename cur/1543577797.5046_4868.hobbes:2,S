I have been using my computer pretty heavily today.
At the same time:
KDE...
Gnapster:  I share a 45Gb IDE drive (filled) - about 10 to 20 transfers happening 
simultaneously - average.
Burning CD-R's:  dumping alot of Old Time Radio programs to CD-R
Browsin the web in Mozilla.
Misc terminals..
xwave:  recording a 1968 Reel to Reel recording of Eugene Ormandy conducting The 
Philadelphia Orchestra playing Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake to eventually burn to 
audio CD and create mp3's.  :-)
Once in a while xingmp3enc for Linux.
I recorded a 200Mb wav file and tried to edit it.  Xwave gobbled up all my swap 
before bringing up a dialog box - out of memory...  My cdburn failed, had to 
start over...
I just closed xwave....  I did not reboot yet and am getting these messages.
My machine is still functioning ok - other than about 27Mb still swapped, so once 
in a while an app feels sluggish as I believe it is getting paged back in.
I was just curious about the message.
