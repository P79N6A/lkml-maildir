What do you mean by "for 10usecs"?

I'm not sure what you are taling about: plain old adjtime() or the NTP kernel 
interface?

Independent of any bits, the precision should be up to 1ns for reading and setting 
the clock, and as a consequence you might provide internal fractional nanoseconds 
(if you want to have a truly stable nanosecond clock model). If we get this right, 
there will be peace in this area until the wires in a PC are significantly shorter 
than 30cm (I think this is how far the light goes in 1ns). ;-)

I see a bug difference between precise time keeping and "playing" with 
timesources.
