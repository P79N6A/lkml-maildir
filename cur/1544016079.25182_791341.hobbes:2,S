It will be similar to oom_adj parameter (although I did not find where
it is inherited from the parent), but with the different updating
interface. I do not think it will be anyhow easier to solve the problem,
since it is not directly in the parent/child hierarchy, since there are
cases when we do want to kill children (this phrase just screams for the
addition: and eat them), but only some processes which are not really
the most significant.
Existing oom score adjustment mechanism works for this cases, but it is
by itself is not convenient to be used. Even its documentation does not
say how it is used :) It is not just simple add/remove, but score
multiplication or division by the two in the power of the oom_adj value.
Plus really no one knows how scores are calculated except those who read
the mm/kill.c before going to sleep.
So effectively oom_adj only works as enable/disable switch, and since no
one knows how to tune it, it is better to do not touch at all. And get
ssh killed. I believe if it is ever used then only to disable oom at
all, which is wrong, since task still may be killed but after some
others. My patch adds a simple priority for that based on the name of
the process, which are known to the administrators who maintain given
system.
