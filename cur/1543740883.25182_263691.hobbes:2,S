Hey, Jeff,
This is a very high traffic list.  If you have nothing constructive to say, 
don't say it.  Many here are already not happy with your attitude already, 
you're not helping.
For my part, you're getting a shiny new procmail entry right to dave null.  
I'm sick of it.
Sorry, everyone else, for adding to the noise.  But someone's gotta say it.
