Argl.  Substitute /dev/zero in the obvious place.  My stupidity.
Here is a test file for generating further stats from within Emacs.
You can call it interactively from within Emacs with
M-x load-library RET testio.el RET
M-x make-test RET
and you can use it from the command line (if you really must) with
emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -l testio.el -eval "(progn(make-test t
  'kill-emacs)(sit-for 100000))"
[unhandled content-type:application/emacs-lisp]
It will then output the read stuff from the process followed by
statistics of block sizes over each second it ran.
The interactive session tends to be somewhat worse, but the command
line version is bad enough for a demonstration.
It is obvious that during most of the time, the pipe only receives
single characters.
Again, I am pretty sure that Emacs is at fault too, but I don't
understand the implications of what scheduling behavior causes the
pipes to remain mostly empty, with an occasional full filling.  It
would be better if Emacs would not be context-switched into the
moment something appears in the pipe, but if the writer to the pipe
would keep the opportunity to fill'er'up until it is either preempted
or needs to wait.  If there was some possibility to force this
behavior from within Emacs, this would be good to know.
Thanks,
