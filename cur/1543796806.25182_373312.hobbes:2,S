Although on the Opteron that is usually what it is (as memory
errors can be reported through the machine check interface)
In this case bank 4 is the appropriate bank.  Although the
other bits don't look right for a memory error.  I wonder
if it is that darn iommu fault again.
To decode an Opteron machine_check you can look in
the bios and kernel programmers guide.  (Possibly the
architecture but I think that is too generic) to see
what all of the bits mean.
It is a pain but is faster than poking blindly in
the dark.
