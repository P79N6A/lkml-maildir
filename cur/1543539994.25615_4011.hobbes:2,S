Hi, thanks for your attention.

The call sequence in question is:
	kernel/exit.c:do_exit
	    kernel/exit.c:__exit_mm
	        kernel/fork.c:mmput
	            mm/mmap.c:exit_mmap

There's no flush_cache_mm in the sequence above, neither
flush_cache_range.  Actually, I only found two flush_cache_mm at:
   FORK:
	kernel/fork.c:do_fork
	    kernel/fork.c:copy_mm
	        kernel/fork.c:dup_mmap
   EXEC:
	fs/binfmt_elf.c:load_elf_binary
	    fs/exec.c:flush_old_exec
	        fs/exec.c:exec_mmap
I think that we also need cache handling for EXIT.  How do you think?
I wonder why other architecture doesn't hit this problem.

That'd be the case, we have to look it again.  But in our current
implementation, flush_cache_mm just call flush_cache_all (because of
my lazyness)...
Besides,

Agreed.
