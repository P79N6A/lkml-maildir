You are right: the documentation should read:
+Memory balancing is _only_ needed for non __GFP_WAIT and non __GFP_IO allocations.
+
+There are two reasons to be requesting non __GFP_WAIT allocations:
+the caller can not sleep (typically intr context), or does not want
+to incur cost overheads of page stealing and possible swap io.
+
+Non __GFP_IO allocations are requested to prevent filesystem deadlocks.
But I would not say __GFP_WAIT and __GFP_IO have no relationship. __GFP_IO
does not make sense if __GFP_WAIT is not set.

Well, I thought about that while coding the patch: you can not try to 
outsmart the programmer who writes that code. For example, I was 
looking at replace_with_highmem() which makes __GFP_HIGHMEM|__GFP_HIGH
requests, although I _think_ it can do __GFP_WAIT|__GFP_IO without
any problems. I just assumed that whoever coded it (you/Mingo?) had
some logic, like not wanting to waste time scanning for stealable pages
or incur disk swap to implement this performance optimization (that
would defeat the optimization).
