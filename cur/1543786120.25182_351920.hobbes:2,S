Well no, it would be a big bug if a keventd thread were to change CPUs.
It's OK to rely upon the pinnedness of keventd I guess - a comment would be
nice.

They do.  I don't believe that preemption is the source of this BUG. 
(Petr, does CONFIG_PREEMPT=n fix it?)

If one is writing preempt-safe code then one should disable preemption
before copying the current CPU number into a local variable.

numa_node_id() must use smp_processor_id(), not raw_smp_processor_id(). 
Then all the runtime squawks need to be audited and fixed, or switched to
(new) raw_numa_node_id() if is is verified that a CPU/node switch at any
time is OK.
