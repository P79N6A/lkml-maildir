My 386 has an ET4000. An ET4000AX/W32 even. And you bet it's because it's 
nifty! Okay, I'll admit the thing doesn't currently run a 2.6 kernel...
The answer will probably be "no", but would this be a good point to ask if 
this would be a good time to not bother with the mode switching code at all 
anymore? I'm generally rather appreciative of old gunk but I haven't cared 
for that specific feature for ages now. I personally don't use framebuffer, 
but I would if I wanted more than the plain VGA my BIOS sets up.
I'd consider keeping anything but VESA 1.2 (which that ET4000 and most all 
other Super VGA cards of the era also do!) nonsensical and as far as I'm 
concerned this includes all the VGA modes with the strange number of lines; 
a 43/60-line VGA screen is too horrible to look at anyway...
Rene.
