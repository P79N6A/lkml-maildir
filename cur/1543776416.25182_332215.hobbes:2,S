What it perhaps needs is a maximum number of spins or something like that.

atomic_t is volatile, so that makes no difference.
Actually, I shouldn't use an atomic_t or a signed int as the CPU ID is
unsigned:-/
I'm using -1 / UINT_MAX as a "not in use" thing, but I'm not sure that's
strictly viable.

I talked it over with David Woodhouse, and he's convinced me that we don't
need the barrier: the only thing we care about is getting a printk within a
printk on the CPU because of an oops. THEN we have to break the lock. And in
that case we're looking for the CPU number being set to that of our CPU, and
only our CPU will ever set that.

Not only that, but the whole function needs wrapping in preemption
disablement, lest the processor ID change under us.
