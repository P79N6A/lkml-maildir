okay - i should be clearer.
the thing that is missing, that only xen provides, is the presentation
of another block device as a hard drive.
e.g. /dev/volumegroup/volumename --> /dev/loopblocka
or   /dev/loop0 -> /dev/loopblocka
such that it is possible to then subsequently do this:
fdisk /dev/loopblocka and
mkfs.ext2 /dev/loopblocka1
mount /dev/loopblocka1 -t ext2 /mnt/somewhere
you get the gist.
basically, the thing that is missing (or i can't find it)
from linux is a driver with the ability to present [any] block
devices with their major+minor numbers as a [fsck-]recogniseable
block device with its own major number, with the implicit
ability to create minor numbers within it.
lvm is in its own way a sort of mad-cap over-extended version
of the above, if you think about it carefully and can understand
the sentence.
