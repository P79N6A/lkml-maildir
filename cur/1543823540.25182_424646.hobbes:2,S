Anrd> There are a number of APIs that allow you to get the time:

Slow, not necessarily safe to call in IRQ context.
Anrd> - ktime_get_ts
Anrd>   monotonic clock, nanosecond resolution
Actual resolution varies by platform, it may be as low as jiffy.
Anrd> - getnstimeofday
Anrd>   reliable, nanosecond TOD clock
(which is only currently implemented with ns resolution on IA64 and
Sparc64, AFAIK) 
Anrd> - xtime
Anrd>   jiffie accurate TOD clock, with fast reads
Too coarse a resolution.
Anrd> - get_cycles

Not very usable on SMP if you want to measure across migration; may be
variable rate.
