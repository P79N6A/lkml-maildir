[PATCH] I2C: Cleanups to the eeprom driver
Here comes a cleanup patch to the i2c eeprom client driver:
* Get rid of the unused i2c_client client_id.
* Get rid of the redundant non-ISA bus check.
* Fix the adapter capability check. We were previously using
  capabilities without checking if they were supported. Document
  which capabilities are required and which are optional.
* Reorder things a bit. In particular, wait to have a valid client
  before we bother checking if this is a Vaio EEPROM.
* Use strlcpy instead of strncpy, because I Heard It Was Better (TM) and
  all other chip drivers use it.
* Take benefit of the auto-increment feature of EEPROMs to speed up the
  Vaio check.
* Display an information message when a Vaio EEPROM is detected.
Tested successfully on my laptop, which happens to be a Vaio.
