First, this is cool. Tree-mounts are very useful and this version seems more
stable. When autofs compiled as a module no problem. When CONFIG_AUTOFS_FS=y
I still get:
	kernel: kmod: failed to exec  -s -k autofs4, errno = 2
though it keeps on working correctly as it seems. I did some greps but
couldn't find the cause in the kernel that easy.
Other minor points:
-	/etc/rc.d/init.d/autofs has a line which had to be removed in order
	to permit options such as "--timeout 60" in /etc/auto.master. I dunno
	what
		options=`echo "$options" | sed -e 's/\(^\|[ \t]\)-/\1/g'`
	is supposed to do at /etc/rc.d/init.d/autofs:85 but it stripped the
	first dash of my "--timeout 60" option.
-	automount --timeout option seems to be ignored: "ps aux" says
	automount is invoked with "--timeout 60", /var/log/messages says
	"300 secs, freq 75". Actual behavior is conform /var/log/messages.
