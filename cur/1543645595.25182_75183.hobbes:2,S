Basically: I would _love_ to test this kernel on my laptop here, but - 
unfortunately - i need the laptop for my work. Which means i need it to work.
So how much chance IS there to trash the filesystems? I guess a lot of ppl 
like me are just waiting to test it out, but aren't willing to screw their 
systems over it...
