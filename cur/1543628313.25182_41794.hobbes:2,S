I did.  Install those triggers and you've got it.  Sorry to sound
uncooperative but the trigger mechanism is there to handle this, and
email notification, and automatic mirroring, and ...
So the mechanism is there, you can make the mechanism do whatever you
want.  If you check in the triggers, they will make their way into each
tree.  So do the first one and write yourself a shell script to use it.
I wouldn't check in the second one.
