Fair enough, but I think the code could become a trifle simpler/easier
after the conversion, so probably greater chances of getting merged :-)

But that's alright -- see, as I said, you're confusing between the
"special device" that represents the *PPS source* itself, with the port
or device that it uses to *physically* connect to the PC.
In the RFC, when they say that the userspace app must open(2) the PPS
source (as they have illustrated in the example too), they mean that
it open(2)'s the special device/file associated with the PPS source,
and *not* the /dev/lpXXX or /dev/ttySXXX that it might be connected
through physically.
So they mean something like /dev/pps0, /dev/pps1 etc instead. Of course,
no such special device exists on a Linux box already, but that's fine
and obvious! *You* are supposed to create / instantiate that when a
pps_register_source() is done from some in-kernel subsystem.

As I said, it's not the char device for the physical interface itself
being discussed there. That could be parport, uart, some arbit GPIO pin
whatever. But whenever the corresponding kernel subsystem does a
register_source(), you could create the /dev/ppsXXX device ...

See above.

Hmm, but that's a non-standard, not-mandated-by-RFC syscall. I don't see
how you can get this merged, really :-)

And again, see above.
