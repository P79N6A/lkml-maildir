Nice idea, but how are you going to get the pre-processor to generate a
string with the proper pattern, based on a bunch of flags and integers?
(not to say it can't be done, just tricky stuff...)

Very nice goal.

Sorry, can't be fully done.  A number of drivers really want to poke
around at the device before they say they really claim the device.  So
we still need to call into them somehow.

I think these can almost already go away now, with the info we have in
sysfs.

That is also a very nice goal.
Again, nice idea, have any idea how the code would look?
