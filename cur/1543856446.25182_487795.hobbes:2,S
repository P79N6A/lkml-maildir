The real reason for the success of the RHEL product line is that its been GPL 
from the beginning.  And commercial software saw it fit to leverage this 
GPL-pool, which is OK, but to then come around and say that "The support 
from commercial software is a major reason for the success of the RHEL 
product line" is trying to portray the situation up-side-down.
This does not mean that we shouldn't allow non-GPL linkage, on the contrary, 
I am even calling for a stable API for the benefit of everyone, but it's 
probably the closed-source market's arrogant behavior that forces 
GPL-developers to respond in kind.  Which is rather sad, if you think about 
it.
Thanks!
