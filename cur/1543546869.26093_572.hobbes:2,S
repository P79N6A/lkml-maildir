Hi Gabor,
as I needed to install Linux-2.2.16 on my laptop, I had to work on your 
software-suspend patch again: There were many changes in apm.c that broke
your v7 patch.
I created v7a, which works fine for me with 2.2.16 (actually 2.2.16-SuSE,
which is rather similar to a 2.2.17-pre1x.)
Find it on

Enjoy!
