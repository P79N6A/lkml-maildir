While discussing this patch on IRC, an interesting idea came up: why not make 
the counters count something different from bytes? "Less granular stats are 
every bit (bad pun intended) as useful." This would break userspace, but 
that's what everyone has to expect during odd releases (i.e. the modules in 
2.5.)
To avoid having to change all the code, we could have (in addition to what we 
currently have) something like tx_kbytes or tx_mbytes which would be updated 
via a timer every x milliseconds (I'd say maybe 350-500). The sysfs and 
procfs interfaces would have to be modified, however those are just couple of 
lines of code.
Using KB would give us additional 10 bits (making the overflow at 4 TB.) I 
don't really like the idea of using MB, but the underlying idea is the same - 
20 more bits, making the limit 4 PB.
What is the consensus on this way of solving the problem?
Jeff.
