JFFS ought to be able to do XIP. You just need to make sure that the 
executable data you want are page-aligned, and remain that way over 
garbage-collection. Then munge the page tables to point at the relevant 
pages directly in the flash chips.
However, for obvious reasons XIP and compression are mutually exclusive. As 
flash is more expensive than RAM, nobody really seems that interested in XIP 
any more.
Some nutter (prumpf) already implemented compression for JFFS, although it 
hasn't been merged yet.
Seriously, if you were looking at XIP with 1MB RAM and 2MB flash, then I'd
advise you to use compression instead, and swap the numbers to 2MB RAM and
1MB flash.
(Actually, JFFS has memory usage problems which need to be addressed before
we can really cut the RAM down that far. Being a log-structured filesystem,
it keeps a permanent cache of data about each node on the media. This means
it uses lots of RAM to cache info about inodes it's rarely going to use, and
also it takes a long time to scan the flash on boot. The problem with
dropping that cache and scanning on demand is that you may need to scan the
_whole_ flash again every time you want to find an inode which you've
previously dropped, which is _slow_.)
