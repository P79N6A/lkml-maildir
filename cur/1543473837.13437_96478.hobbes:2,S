I don't usually post to this list, but since everyone wants 2.2.0 to be
the best it can possibly be, I thought I'd post these minor bugs I had
with it.
First, "make xconfig" is still broken, but you probably already knew that:
Error in startup script: invalid command name "clear_choices"
    while executing "clear_choices"
    (procedure "read_config" line 3)
    invoked from within "read_config .config"
    (file "scripts/kconfig.tk" line 485)
make: *** [xconfig] Error 1
Also, "make menuconfig" is segfaulting on me, but I suspect that is due to
my using bleeding-edge Redhat Rawhide RPMs for GLIBC 2.1 more than
anything else.  I think my version of ncurses might be incompatible with
the new glibc, and I'm going to try updating my ncurses packages as soon
as I can login to rawhide.redhat.com.  If that doesn't work, I'll try to
track down the bug further and file it with Redhat.
Finally, this appears to be a harmless message, but I wanted to report it.  
When I mount FAT32 partitions, I get this warning:
fat_read_super: Bad fsinfo_offset
I found where this was being generated (in fat/inode.c), and changed the
debug message to:
 printk("fat_read_super: Bad fsinfo_offset: %ld - %d + 1 > %ld\n",
MSDOS_SB(sb)->fsinfo_offset, sizeof(MSDOS_SB(sb)->fsinfo_offset),
bh->b_size); 
and got this output:
fat_read_super: Bad fsinfo_offset: 992 - 4 + 1 > 0
So it looks like bh->b_size is getting set to 0 somewhere.  It seems like
a harmless error, because I can access my partitions just fine, so I
don't really want to dig deeper, but it is a scary warning, and if it's
meaningless, then it should go away.
