Read and write don't matter so much; they can be handled easily enough in
the driver.  The real problem is the race between open() and unregister().  
We rely on the low-level drivers to make them mutually exclusive, but it
really should be done by the subsystem.  More precisely, the subsystem
should guarantee that all outstanding calls to open() have completed
before unregister() returns.

"Should not be accessed" is correct, but there's nothing wrong in 
principle with acquiring a lock in the device structure, provided the 
driver does nothing else.  And provided that the driver pins the subsystem 
module, so the device's release() routine will be called _before_ the 
subsystem can be unloaded.
