Ok.

How? It's just an ordinary process with no special permissions or access to 
memory. The communication between the userspace process and the kernel is in 
the form of a netlink socket, with the only messages sent back and forth 
being what should be displayed or what actions the user requested. Everything 
related to preparing the image and performing the I/O is done in the kernel. 
There's no way I can see that a malicious userspace program could modify 
anything but its own memory.
Regards,
Nigel
