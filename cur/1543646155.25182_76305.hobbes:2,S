Alan,
Would it be possible to put a secondary call table behind
the call gate wrappered in sys_ni_syscall that a module
could register against.  Is it merely the fact that the
call gate table itself must be static?  A secondary table
and a mechanism to register against the secondary table with
kernel locks taken behind the call gate would be trivial,
I think.
Does that sound like the best way to go about it?
