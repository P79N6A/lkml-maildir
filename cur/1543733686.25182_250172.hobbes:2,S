That's one way of doing it, sure ... ;-)
With HP's Dino PCI controller, you generate I/O cycles on the PCI bus by
writing the address to the DINO_PCI_ADDR register, then reading or writing
the DINO_IO_DATA register.

The PPC64 iSeries port seems to do a hypervisor call for readb() et al.
Nasty stuff.

It can even depend on machine model ... only some ia64 platforms have
different bus view and physical view (see Documentation/IO-mapping.txt)

We have four options on i386 -- direct1, direct2, bios and mmconfig.
Other platforms ... well, get even weirder.  Magic registers, firmware
calls, memory mapped.  It's all been done.
