Either the drive or the cdrom driver is storing a "disc size".  When I read 
from a regular CD-ROM or CD-R the "disc size" gets reset so that the entire 
disc is accesible.  When I insert a DVD, "disc size" isn't reset and I can 
only read up to the length of the last CD read.  (For example, if I read 
from the Win98 cd, then put in a DVD, I can only read the first 654,526,464 
bytes).  This is reading directly from the /dev/cdrom device.  On the DVD I 
actually get an EOF at 654,526,464 bytes.  The file system shows files 
beyond this point, but an attempt to read them yields an I/O error.  I'm not 
sure where to look for the problem, but I know it does not lie in the UDF 
filesystem driver (as I receive these errors without ever mounting the DVD)  
I think the problem is in cdrom.c or ide-cd.c
This is not a problem with CSS, as I am authenticating the disc with the 
command "tstdvd /dev/cdrom".  Before running this command it is only 
possible to read 1 - 10 MB of the disc before receiving an I/O error.
I have the latest cdrom driver patch and UDF patch for my kernel.
I have slackware 7.0, kernel version 2.2.13 and an Acer DVP 1040A (aka 
Pioneer 114).
Thanks a lot,
