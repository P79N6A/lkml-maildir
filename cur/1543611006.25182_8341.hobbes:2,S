Just wondering if we should be clever for the users here.  Maybe I 
should leave that to user-space tools?  Or is there anything in devfs 
that can take care of this?  The nice solution for end-users might be
a /dev/idefloppy that is a symlink to the relevant node in the 
/dev/ide... tree.

Because you can boot from a zip or ls-120 drive, with the BIOS setting 
it to this mode.  There are disks out there that are unreadable unless 
you ignore track zero, by formatting them in a PC like this.

OK.  This makes the most sense here.  I'm happy to go with this.
I'll dig out your patch - discovered I was on holiday when you 
originally submitted it - and code and test something over the next day 
or so.  Thanks for the help
