okay - built reiserfs directly into the kernel rather than as a module - 
system now boots - initio driver loads (though the system hangs for a 
second or two while loading) but seems to be working - weird problem 
though - when playing an audio cd, I only get sound from the right 
channel - cd works fine in my ide cdrom drive - don't know if this has 
anything to do with the initio driver or not - will do more testing - 
thanks for your help Mike.

Okay - patched the kernel (thanks Mike) - as far as I can tell, it built 
cleanly - however (comma) now I'm getting a kernel panic at boot - 
"unable to mount /dev/hdc1" which is my / partition - attaching my 
.config - also am using initrd and reiserfs - any tips, hints, 
suggestions anyone?
