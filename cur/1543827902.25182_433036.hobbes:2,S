recommend reading hans' future_vision.html paper at namesys.com, as
well as dominic's "FS design with the Be file system" which is a pdf
somewhere online now.  some intense study of ADT's is also recommended

others have suggested that all this belongs in user-space.  hans and i
argue that point every once in a while still.  i think it comes down
