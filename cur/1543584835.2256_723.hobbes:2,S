code cleanups.
Just try this on i386: (PIPE_BUF is defined to 4096 on i386 - I really
don't understand why, but now it's too late to reverse it back to 512)
<<<<
char buf[PIPE_BUF];
void main()
{
    int pipes[2];
    pipe(pipes);
    write(pipes[1],buf,sizeof(buf));
}
<<<<<<<
It returns immediately on all unix platforms I tested, including all
linux versions, except with davem's patch.
It's not guaranteed in sus or posix, but I'm reluctant to change it.
