FiSC "crashes" the kernel immediately after a file system operation
(creat, mkdir, write, etc) returns.  Presumably, if a file system is
mounted -o sync, all the FS operations should be done synchronously. i.e.,
if creat("foo") returns, the file "foo" better be on disk.  It turns out
not the case for ext2, jfs and reiserfs.
