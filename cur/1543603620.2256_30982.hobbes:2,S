Because as DaveM pointed out, some hardware can't do it, and as I said
earlier, it's a lot cheaper and easier for driver writers to just
store the extra pointer in their data structures than it is to
implement a database to maintain it.
Remember you often need this address in the hot path (say TX interrupt
handler) so you don't want to introduce any unnecessary function calls.
