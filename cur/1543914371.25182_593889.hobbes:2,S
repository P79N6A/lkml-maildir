I thought this list seemed a little long, so I investigated a couple
of them.  mbind makes sense (it's only implemented for NUMA ... a NUMA
embedded platform?  not the kind which runs applications that use mbind),
but mremap doesn't -- there's even an implementation in mm/nommu.c.
Could you check the rest of these over to see if they truly don't need
to be implemented for no-mmu?  I think you'll want the *robust_list
syscalls too.

a retrograde step."
