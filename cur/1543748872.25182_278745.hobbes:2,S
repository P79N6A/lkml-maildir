Single shot timer is unusable for system time accounting, at least as
long as you want to allow nmi. This is a tangible fact, no matter how
simple the example is.
Even the lost tick compensation is not working at all, and it has the
same issues that the one-shot timer has in keeping the system time
accurate.
Pavel, write a program to do iopl(2) cli() wait 3msec; sti() wait 3msec
cli() wait 3msec in a loop. Then watch your system time go in the future
at a rate of a few minutes per hour, then fix it. After you fixed it
we'll get my attention about one-shot timer again ;). I already tried to
fix it and failed so far since I can't see bugs in the current code.
(actually I fixed it by breaking the code, and dropping some ticks
somewhere)
