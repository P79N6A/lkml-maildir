Ok, i tried 2.2.19 with only justin's driver.  everything works.  The tagged
queue is the default, 253, when doing:
for x in b c d;do cp zero sd$x&;done
it works.  2.2.17 stock would give me errors before the end of the write and
just hang.  2.4.x with and without justin's driver would also do the same.
I used 2.2.19 with justin's latest (as of like 3 days ago) driver.  I just
now had time to try it.
I'll give 2.4.1 another try with justin's latest driver (time permitting)
