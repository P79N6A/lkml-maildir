I'm currently testing both schedulers from Ingo and you on top of
2.6.0-test2-mm3. I'll need a little time to study some annoyances I've
seen. For example, I've seen XMMS skipping with patch-A3-O12.2int,
altough I've been able to manage to find a way to consistently reproduce
them. The Evolution 1.4.4 main window also feels a little "heavy", that
is, moving it all along the screen, makes the movement feel jumpy
sometimes.
The scheduler seems to be getting in good health, and it's getting
smoother with each release. However, I've found that the smoothest
scheduler I've seens was O10.
I'll keep you all informed about my experiences with both schedulers.
