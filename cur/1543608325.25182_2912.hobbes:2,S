I noticed but I thought everybody else would complain :-)

I did my usual kernel compile testings and here are the resuls:
                    j25       j50       j75      j100

2.4.13-pre5aa1:   4:57.93   5:09.76   5:24.76   5:26.79
2.4.14-pre6:      4:58.88   5:16.68   5:45.93   7:16.56
2.4.14-pre6:      4:55.72   5:34.65   5:57.94   6:50.58
2.4.14-pre6:      4:59.46   5:16.88   6:25.83   6:51.43
2.4.14-pre6:      4:56.38   5:18.88   6:15.97   6:31.72

2.4.14-pre7:      4:56.39   5:22.84   6:09.05   9:56.59
2.4.14-pre7:      4:56.55   5:25.15   7:01.37   7:03.74
2.4.14-pre7:      4:59.44   5:15.10   6:06.78   12:51.39*

2.4.14-pre7:      4:58.17   5:26.80   6:41.44      *
The last three of the runs of make -j100 with -pre7 failed since some
processes (portmap and cc1) were killed. So the oom killer seems to
kill (in case of portmap) the wrong processes and might trigger a little
too early. I have no data about the swap / mem usage at that time since
the script runs unattended.
Otherwise -pre5aa1 still seems to be the fastest kernel *in this test*.
I have not checked about the interactivity issues so this might be a
*feature*.
