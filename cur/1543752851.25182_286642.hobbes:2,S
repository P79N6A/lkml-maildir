Just add some dummy function pointers at the end of the table
and have them point to a procedure that returns -ENOSYS.
 	existing:
 	.long	sys_request_key
 	.long	sys_keyctl
syscall_table_size = (. -sys_call_table)
 	new:
 	.long	sys_request_key
 	.long	sys_keyctl
mine:	.long	sys_in_syscall
 	.long	sys_in_syscall
 	.long	sys_in_syscall
 	.long	sys_in_syscall
.global	mine
.type	mine,@object
syscall_table_size = (. -sys_call_table)
Export whatever you want to find your entries in your module.
Your module modifies the pointers at will ('mine' is now an
array of 4 pointers). To prevent crashes, save what was in
the pointer you modified and put it back before your module exits!
Just don't expect this to be put into a standard kernel.
Cheers,
