If all you want to do is keep a backup/vfat file image intact. How about
a mount option which makes the kernel Vfat filesystem expose VFAT
filenames as sfn:lfn:attrib, or similiar.
If a file is created without the colons -EINVAL is rasied.
Ok so it's not nice but it solves the problems, without multiple dentry
links or other bogosities, Except of course of those filenames which
become unusable. I wouldn't want to traverse this filesystem as a human
but that not necessarily important if its a mount option.
