Those have the 20268 chip, right?

I've recently installed a Ultra133 TX2 (PDC 20269) in a box, and it
also only does UDMA33 in 2.4.20-pre11. 2.5.44 with the PDC driver
for "new" chips does UDMA100, however. (The disk is only UDMA100.)
The latest 2.4.20-pre-ac is supposed to have new IDE drivers, but
I haven't had time to test it myself.

Unlikely.

Did those boards also use standard 2.4 kernels?
