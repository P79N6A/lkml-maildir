This issue has been discussed with Paul D. Smith which also provided
a patch similar to yours.
The patch is in the kbuild queue for 2.6.17.
But we also agreed to postpose this change in make until next stable
release. So if you update your make to latest CVS version you will no
longer see this misbehaviour.
And when 2.6.17 opens up kbuild will be 'fixed' in mainline kernel.
