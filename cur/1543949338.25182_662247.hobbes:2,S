I'm not a bit fan of the match-the-existing-style approach.
You'll find that files which started out with a non-standard style already
contain a mixup of styles, because later changes were often made in
standard-style.
And given that we're churning the code anyway, we might as well fix it up now. 
Yes, that'll make the code look partially-weird rather than wholly-weird,
but I doubt if that will harm anyone much.
