Hi,
My mouse is a IntelliMouse PS/2. Scrolling the wheel without pressing
the middle button works fine, but when pressing it the events are duplicated.
I am using Fedora core 1.
This is with -test10, with -test9 events were duplicated even without
pressing the middle button.
Here is an output from xev, I don't know what those KeymapNotify are,
I get one for every mouse button pressed.
KeymapNotify event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x0,
    keys:  88  0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   
           0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
