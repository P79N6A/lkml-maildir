Yes, I got it haven't done anything about it yet (I blame the snow ...)

My idea was to compare before and after ...

But everything looks fine. As I read that the card is still receiving data
and generating interrupts. After "Transmit frame" you get an interrupt
with status=2 (IntrTxDone) and you get rx interrupts as well.
One thing that is odd is that the rx status is always the same and a
broadcast, when sending something do you get anything other than
"via_rhine_rx() status is 00409700" ?
