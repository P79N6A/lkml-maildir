Hi David,
Here is the detailed compile error :
In file included from /home/compudj/git/linux-2.6-lttng/arch/sparc64/mm/tlb.c:18:
include2/asm/tlb.h: In function `tlb_flush_mmu':
include2/asm/tlb.h:61: warning: implicit declaration of function `release_pages'
include2/asm/tlb.h: In function `tlb_remove_page':
include2/asm/tlb.h:93: warning: implicit declaration of function `page_cache_release'
About linux/swap.h :
#ifdef CONFIG_SWAP
..
extern void free_pages_and_swap_cache(struct page **, int);
..
#else
..
/* only sparc can not include linux/pagemap.h in this file
 * so leave page_cache_release and release_pages undeclared... */
#define free_pages_and_swap_cache(pages, nr) \
        release_pages((pages), (nr), 0);
..
#endif
So when CONFIG_SWAP is not defined, release_pages is missing. As states
the comment, the sparc architecture cannot include linux/pagemap.h from
linux/swap.h because of the following loop :
linux/pagemap.h inc linux/mm.h inc asm-sparc/pgtable.h inc linux/swap.h
Which leaves all other architectures, including sparc64, without a proper
release_pages declaration if they do not include linux/pagemap.h by
themselves.

Mathieu
