It has stagnated.  I think the mindset has been "oh, we need to ship a hack
because upstream is bust" and so nobody did anything.

Migrating away from this will require work from vendors, Oracle, PAM
developers, /bin/login and /bin/su developers.  Until that has happened I
think we should arrange for vendor kernels and kernel.org kernels to offer
the same interfaces.
And I don't think pulling the feature out of kernel.org kernels will
provide any added stimulus, frankly.  They'll just ship the hack and go off
to do something else.
If someone had done the kernel and userspace work 6-12 months ago then
sure, we wouldn't be in this situation.
As to whether it is practical to jam all this work through at this stage:
dunno, really.  I doubt it.  It would be good to try though.
