Which unresolved races?
The reason why I do a resynch every CPU is to prevent the HPET timer from
rolling over more than once before reading it again, which could happen
if the CPU doesn't go into HLT for a long time.

I could make it fall back to a full syscall after a certain number of tries.
This, coupled with using a preemption count instead of touching the seq lock
should prevent the livelock (because if we don't touch the seq lock in switch_to
the livelock would not be possible in the full gettimeofday() syscall).

Because otherwise .jiffies (IIRC) collides with .vsyscall_0.

This is just a forward declaration, but I'll get rid of it anyway.
Thanks a lot for the feedback.
I'll try to address these issues and send and a fixed patch.
