??? The comma *is* a complete token.  So the future change (which won't
happen, btw, since C9x has a different way to implement vararg macros)
would make the macros work as expected independent of whitespace.  And, of
course, the whole thing is only relevant when the variable part is empty,
but i don't think the macros are currently ever used this way.
