I don't understand the question. A previous email explained the reason
to have mutiple steps.

I don't understand the comment.

It shouldn't matter. If it is truly important for a particular platform
to make sure that there is no i/o, then the low-level i/o routines
could be modified to drop any accidentally issued i/o on the floor.
This doesn't require a change to either the API or the policy.

As explained previously, not all drivers may want to have a full
electrical device reset.

Just because the current drivers do it this way does not mean that this is
the best way to do things. A full reset is time-consuming. Some drivers
may want to implement a faster and quicker reset.
