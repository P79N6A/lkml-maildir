Approx. 90% of the time my es1371 sound card refuses to work.
dmesg reveals:
es1371: version v0.27 time 16:38:48 Mar  3 2001
es1371: found chip, vendor id 0x1274 device id 0x1371 revision 0x08
PCI: Found IRQ 10 for device 00:0b.0
es1371: found es1371 rev 8 at io 0xa400 irq 10
es1371: features: joystick 0x0
ac97_codec: AC97  codec, id: 0x0000:0x0000 (Unknown)
When it works (I'm not sure, but a clean boot helps) the id fields are
non-zero.
My setup:
Athlon/KX133 (VIA chipset)/Creative SB64 PCI
kernel 2.4.2/gcc 2.96 (latest)
I am using devfs also.
