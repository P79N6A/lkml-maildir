Thats the same conclusion I've since come to, Valdis.  And, now that 
I've moved my /var to its own partition on another disk, that may 
have reduced the thrashing of that drive enough to stop the problem.  
At least I've had no more such occurances since I moved /var off 
of /.  About 30.5 hours now according to the uptime display in 
gkrellm.

I've been thinking about it too, but I found a bug in one of the 
amanda utilities thats had my attention the last day or so & just 
fixed in the last half hour.  If you can make a patch out of those 
printk's against rc2-mm1, send it along and I'll taste-test for the 
arsenic in the desert too maybe.  The More Eyeballs theory & all that 
rot.
