The core should not dictate the valid range of values. The bus drivers
should decide, since they are their states. "1" also used to work.

I don't follow - the BUG() call was introduced recently for reasons
unknown. The interface had never triggered that previously.

I don't follow this argument either.
I really fail to see what your fundamental objection is. This restores
compatability, makes the core simpler, and adds the ability to use the
additional states, should drivers choose to implement them; all for
relatively little code. It seems a like a good thing to me..
