Not really.  The use of a segment register is just a way to compensate
for the lack of registers on the i386; on any other CPU you would
typically use a GPR for the glocal data base pointer.  The function is the
same: you add the glocal data base pointer to each address; this is an
attribute on the pointer data type.
