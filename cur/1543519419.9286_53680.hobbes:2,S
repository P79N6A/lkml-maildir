Hi!
Is it possible to put priorities on partition access?
eg. I have:
/dev/md0 on / type ext2 (rw)
/dev/md1 on /usr type ext2 (rw)
/dev/md2 on /var type ext2 (rw,usrquota)
/dev/md3 on /home type ext2 (rw,usrquota)
/dev/md4 on /tmp type ext2 (rw)
/dev/md5 on /mnt/store type ext2 (rw)
md5 : active raid0 hdc8[2] hdb8[1] hda8[0] 40803456 blocks 32k chunks
md4 : active raid0 hdc7[2] hdb7[1] hda7[0] 675456 blocks 32k chunks
md0 : active raid1 hdc1[2] hdb1[1] hda1[0] 204992 blocks [3/3] [UUU]
md1 : active raid5 hdc3[2] hdb3[1] hda3[0] 2097408 blocks level 5, 64k chunk, algorithm 0 [3/3] [UUU]
md2 : active raid5 hdc5[2] hdb5[1] hda5[0] 153984 blocks level 5, 64k chunk, algorithm 2 [3/3] [UUU]
md3 : active raid5 hdc6[2] hdb6[1] hda6[0] 511872 blocks level 5, 64k chunk, algorithm 2 [3/3] [UUU]
It is used console and remote by unix users, and also serves az a
fileserver (/mnt/store).
 I would like to set priorities for partition access to something like
this:
0 md0 (highest)
1 md1
2 md2, md3, md4
4 md5
So that access request for partition 1 is always performed before req. for
2,3,4,5, ut never before a pending part. 0 request.
Is this possible with linux?
