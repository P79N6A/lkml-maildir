Given this, would it be better to make the sysfs node name depend on
which firmware we're loading - rather than "data" always.  I realise
we could just require firmware requests for a particular device
instance to be serialised, however my instinct says using different
nodes would be more robust: it will be easier to figure out what's
gone wrong if a script error or a kernel bug has resulted in
attempting to load two images at once.
