It is described in the patch description, though perhaps not  
explicitly enough:
"To get this working we change the aio_complete() path so that the ring
insertion is performed as the final iocb reference is dropped."
This stops an aio_complete() from generating a completion event  
before the submission path has had a chance to generate an error.   
This could happen if O_DIRECT bios completed very quickly before the  
submission path had a chance to return up and call  
ivalidate_inode_pages2_range().
