It is too much complicated for new reporters.
I remember I sent a patch by mail for NTP to people at ISC, and they asked
me to pass through bugzilla because it was important for them to track it.
What initially was a 5 minutes email turned to a 30 minutes nightmare with
doubts at every click, and it was even difficult for me to attach the patch.
Later they replied to me by mail, which I consulted from another address, I
replied and was rejected because it was not the same address... I had to be
very very motivated to use such a crap.
Definitely the tool we need if we want to reduce the number of bug reports!
Just my experience as a bug reporter...
