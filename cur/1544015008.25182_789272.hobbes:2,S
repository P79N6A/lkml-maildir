No, I took FASYNC out of SETFL_MASK, so it isn't changed here.

Good point, that's not quite right.  That will make things a bit uglier -
we can't hold file_flags_lock when we call ->fasync() - but I'll fix it.
Unless people think that this approach is completely wrong too, of course.

Not very good, but does anybody know of a workload which would result in
that mutex being contended ever?
