Please read what I wrote, not what you think I wrote.
If I only *read* those files, the mtime will not be updated, only the
atime.
And the files *will* then magically begin to disappear although they are
frequently used.
That will happen with a standard piece of software in a standard
configuration, in a scenario that may or may not be common... I have no
idea how common such a setup is - but I know how much it would suck to
have files magically disappearing because of a kernel upgrade  :)
