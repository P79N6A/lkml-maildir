Actually, that is what I expect to get tomorrow, when I have access to
hardware and can verify it.

Yes, I agree.  It is any the "Cramfs didn't find it's magic number,
now we'll try another filesystem instead. Usually this should be
harmless and you can safely ignore this message." that bothers me,
because the current wording sounds more like "Something terrible has
happened, go and find someone to bug with this."
What do you propose instead?
