Subject: [PATCH 1/5] The config option itself
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/31/125

The option is called NAMESPACES. It can be selectable only
if EMBEDDED is chosen (this was Eric's requisition). When
the EMBEDDED is off namespaces will be on automatically.
