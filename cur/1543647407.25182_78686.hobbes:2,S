Hello,
since some kernels revision, it begins to boot with the white on black,
and the at atyfb initialisation, the white is remplaced by blue and I
can't read anymore???
From dmesg:
atyfb: 3D RAGE PRO (BGA, AGP) [0x4742 rev 0x7c] 8M SGRAM, 14.31818 MHz XTAL, 230 MHz PLL, 100 Mhz MCLK
Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 128x48
fb0: ATY Mach64 frame buffer device on PCI
And I use this in lilo.conf:
vga = extended
append="video=atyfb:1024x768-16@100"
I'll should maybe retry without the vga arg???
Thank you very much and have a great day,
	Grégoire
