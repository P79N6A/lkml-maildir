Do this trivial one first. See how it fares.
Although I don't know how much -mm will do for it. There is certainly not 
going to be any correctness problems, afaik, just *performance* problems. 
Does anybody do any performance testing on -mm?
That said, talking about correctness/performance problems:

Isn't that test the wrong way around?
Shouldn't it be
	if (likely(pte_none(*page_table))) {
without any logical negation? Was this patch tested?
Anyway, I'm not against this, but I can see somebody actually *wanting* 
the ZERO page in some cases. I've used the fact for TLB testing, for 
example, by just doing a big malloc(), and knowing that the kernel will 
re-use the ZERO_PAGE so that I don't get any cache effects (well, at least 
not any *physical* cache effects. Virtually indexed cached will still show 
effects of it, of course, but I haven't cared).
That's an example of an app that actually cares about the page allocation 
(or, in this case, the lack there-of). Not an important one, but maybe 
there are important ones that care?
