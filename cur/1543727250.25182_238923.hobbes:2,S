Looks ok for me. It would be nice though if the code returning the
shadow copy could be "hooked" by the driver, that way, the radeon
kernel driver can force-enable the ROM decoding... or do you want
to use pci quirks for that too ?

Probably... can't we have arch-independant quirks ? Especially with the
new quirk section stuff David just posted, we can have quirks pretty much
anywhere...
