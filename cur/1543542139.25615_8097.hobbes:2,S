I have always been annoyed by the fact that save/restore_flags save/restore the
flags using an unsigned long variable. I think it would be clearer to use
typedef struct { unsigned long _flags; } flags_t;
or something like that.
Also, I've seen people confused by the "pass by reference" conventions of both
functions. It might be remotely useful to change it to a true function-like
style passing a pointer to the variable instead.
