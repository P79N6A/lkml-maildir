Which makes me wonder, why did you ever use a semaphore here? Looking at
the code its a straight forward mutex. And when you would have used a
mutex lockdep would have warned about this.
There is hardly ever a good reason to use semaphores in new code, we're
trying very hard to get rid of them.
Hmm, then again, does ia64 have lockdep?
