did you try the last version I sent out ??
it was one which said supersedes last patch which had a line missing from
it...
if so I'll have a try at locating that bug ... I've just done parallel
finds and du and ls -lar on this end .. I didn't try a parallel kernel
compile .. I'll give it a go tomorrow ..
I can't seem to get a localhost mount working,
I do a 
mount -t nfs -o tcp,nolock localhost:/exported-dir /mnt
and it gives the usual mount error .. and a kernel error .. 
Dave.
