I recently had to change jiffies_64 (include/linux/jiffies.h) to be
volatile as gcc produced code that didn't work as a result of it.
Clearly in some cases gcc does know about volatile and does produce
'the right thing' --- I don't really see why people claim volatile is
a bad thing, there are clearly places where we need this and gcc seems
to do the right thing.
