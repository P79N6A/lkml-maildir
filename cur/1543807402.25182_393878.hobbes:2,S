Hi Carlos,
Could you give some more information?
1. How do you boot the kernel? Bootrom?
    If yes: Which protocol? PXE + pxelinux? Etherboot? ...
2. Does ip auto configuration (e.g. ip=dhcp at kernel command line) work?
    If you do see the "IP-Config: Complete:" message while booting with
    ip=dhcp or ip=bootp or if you don´t see it is a very valuable 
information.
3. Does portmap lookup work? If ip auto configuration does not work and
    you try to give the information on the command line, this will most
    probably fail too, but please give it a try.
4. Could it be that you try to mount root using nfs version 2?
    The current linux nfs 2 server is unable to serve the current nfs 2 
client.
    Unfortunately  version 2 is the default. Add the v3 parameter:
        root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=%s,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,v3
cu,
 Knut
