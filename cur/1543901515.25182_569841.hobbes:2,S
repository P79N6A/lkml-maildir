No, I missed that. Yeah, that would get a bit slower, but I'm not sure
if it would be a problem on a kernel where you have spinlock debuggin
on anyway.
If it becomes a problem, we could perhaps do a version for ticket locks
that first takes a ticket, and then is for up to a second before
printing the stuck lock message. That would make the performance hit go away.
