I never said that. What I said was that because I can't spend lots of
time tracking changes, _sometimes_ I miss them. You will see in the SVN
repo logs a lot of places where I merge in changes from your tree. It's
a fact that people make mistakes. I've already rectified this one by
adding in the patch to the linux1394 repo.
I wasn't pushing off blame, just noting that it's not possible to never
make mistakes. You make them too.
