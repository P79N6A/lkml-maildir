Maybe.  Here is a patch to arch/i386/config.in to try it that way.
Ingo, is this OK?
After the first patch, is another small patch to arch/i386/Config.help which
provides some explanation of CONFIG_HIGHPTE, which I hope is not
too inaccurate.  This supercedes the original change to arch/i386/Config.help.
