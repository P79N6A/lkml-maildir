2.2.15-pre already has the 6-byte command issue fixed. Regardless of
what the switch statement contains, we initially use 10-byte read/writes
to talk to the drive and only fall back to 6-byte commands if the
10-byte variants fail. So the current kernel solution isn't an
all-or-nothing one.
So I suggest just using 2.2.15-pre and if that doesn't work, well
we need to fix something else. I have a SD-W1111 drive myself and
it works fine in 2.2.15-pre.
