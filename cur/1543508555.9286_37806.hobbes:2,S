That was kind of the idea... There is a reason for flagging code
DANGEROUS. Only people who really doesn't care if their dogs die, their
grandmas get abducted by aliens, their disks crashed and their screens
burned out enables such code, while many wannabe hackers enables
EXPERIMENTAL code.
It's all a question of psychology. While EXPERIMENTAL sounds cool and
inviting, DANGEROUS doesn't quite have that ring to itself...
