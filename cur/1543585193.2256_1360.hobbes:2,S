... in which case concurrency is maximised, but there is a
possibility of doing double work...

Indeed, having threaded apps do multiple page faults at the
same time is the main goal of this patch. However, I don't
see how it would be good for scalability to have multiple
threads fault in the same page at the same time, when they
could just wait for one of them to do the work.
Only faults for different addresses would proceed, not faults
for the same address...
