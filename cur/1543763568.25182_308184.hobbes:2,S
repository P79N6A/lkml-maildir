The direct i/o code is mapping the read request to the file system
block.  If the file size was not on a block boundary, the result
would show the the read reading past EOF.  This was only happening
for the AIO case.  The non-AIO case truncates the result to match
file size (in direct_io_worker).  This patch does the same thing
for the AIO case, it truncates the result to match the file size
if the read reads past EOF.
