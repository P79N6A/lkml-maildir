Finally I have found the bug which prevented SieFS (slink) from
working.  The bug was in drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c:
@@ -131,16 +141,20 @@ static void change_termios(struct tty_st
 		}
 	}
 
-	if (tty->driver.set_termios)
-		(*tty->driver.set_termios)(tty, &old_termios);
+	ld = tty_ldisc_ref(tty);
+	if (ld != NULL) {
+		if (ld->set_termios)
+			(ld->set_termios)(tty, &old_termios);
+		tty_ldisc_deref(ld);
+	}
+	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&tty_termios_lock, flags);
 
-	if (tty->ldisc.set_termios)
-		(*tty->ldisc.set_termios)(tty, &old_termios);
 }
 
The call to tty->driver.set_termios was lost, therefore the serial
port speed was not set properly.
Simply adding this call back does not work, because set_termios
handlers in usbserial use semaphores for locking, and therefore cannot
be called while holding the tty_termios_lock spinlock.  Because of
this, some more backporting from 2.6.x is needed - Alan Cox has
already changed tty_termios_lock to a per-tty semaphore in 2.6.x, this
change is needed for 2.4.x too.
The patches are in separate emails: first is the backport of the
termios locking changes, second patch adds back lost call to
tty->driver.set_termios (which is safe after first patch).
