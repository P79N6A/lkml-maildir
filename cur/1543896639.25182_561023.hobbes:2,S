thanks! I ran into this before and asked for the fastcalls to not be 
removed from upstream paravirt.c but to no avail it seems. It does no 
harm to anyone to keep the 'fastcall' declarations and definitions for 
places where _actual assembly code_ depends on the calling convention. 
Could someone please send this upstream-wards too?
