No oops. The log just stops right after ttyUSB0 and tyUSB1 are created. The
precise sequence upon pressing the sync button seems to be: (1) The Visor
enables and hub.c detects two new USB ports. (2) Modules visor and usbserial
do their thing to bind them to /dev devices. (3) A usb-uhci interrupt is
generated one second later. (4) The system hangs before any other access to
the ports occurs. The next log entry comes about 1.5 minutes later after a
reboot.
I am reposting the log excerpt below. 
It seems to me that it is not user programs accessing the modules which
triggers the hang. It is the creation of two new USB ports. If there is some
way to increase the debug verbosity, I would be willing to try it, even if
that means editing the module sources.

I will try that.
