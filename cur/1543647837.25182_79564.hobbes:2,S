I also had unexplained slowdown recently and after changing my
buffer sizes (rsize/wsize) back to 1024 (they have always been 8192),
speed increased 10x.
After banging my head for an hour or so this message was what made me
try the lower sizes.

Even though the message states upgrading to 2.4.19 fixed it for him,
I'm using 2.4.19 on both machines and it looks like the problem still
persists.
Willing to give any info to those that care.
