I did look at the diff. Did you? I generated the patch with diff -ur,
it does not contain the files which are special to s390 or s390x (like
the math-emu or the 31 bit compat layer). The patch is 5600 lines. A
small part of this diff can probably be avoided but you end up with
3000-4000 lines of real diff. Because of the size of this a merge of
s390 and s390x isn't simple and shouldn't be done in a hurry.
blue skies,
