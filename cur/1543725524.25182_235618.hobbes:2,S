Subject: [BUG?] Console driver name in 2.4.26 in /proc/devices without devfs.

Hello!
I am running Linux-2.4.26 without devfs.
And I see this in /proc/devices:
Character devices:
...
  4 vc/%d
...
You can see following in drivers/char/console.c in con_init ():
	console_driver.magic = TTY_DRIVER_MAGIC;
	console_driver.name = "vc/%d";
	console_driver.name_base = 1;
	console_driver.major = TTY_MAJOR;
I suggest:
	console_driver.magic = TTY_DRIVER_MAGIC;
#ifdef CONFIG_DEVFS_FS
	console_driver.name = "vc/%d";
#else
	console_driver.name = "vc";
#endif
	console_driver.name_base = 1;
	console_driver.major = TTY_MAJOR;
Thank you!
