No, like i said, the docs are unclear on these issues :) That's why so many 
people get it wrong.

Yes, in these cases flashplayer should use either the default pcm device 
[which the user can then tweak to his liking] or provide some means to 
configure it. for example via a dotfile in the user's homedir. This is not 
ALSA's fault.

I agree that it would be nice to have a tool to select the default device in 
ALSA.

ALSA must be improved, too.  But that doesn't change a thing about these apps 
misusing the ALSA API and people blaming ALSA lateron. Which is wrong.

I don't think any serious person believes that ALSA is perfect :)
