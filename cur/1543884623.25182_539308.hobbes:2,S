Very nice, looks much better now than the previous version.

The compatible property should be a little more specific, imho. Since there
are differences in how things are done depending on the board, it would be
good to tell the exact method from the pcmcia node itself.
For example, you could make this
	compatible = "8xx\0mpc885ads";
Your code doesn't currently use this, I like to have the option.

If you define the global variable in the board code, you can not have multiple
board implementations in a multiplatform kernel.
In order to make that work, you'd need to have the definition of m8xx_pcmcia_ops
in 8xx common code, and then assign the two function pointers dynamically in the
board initialization.

A new of_iomap() function was recently added that allows you
to do these two steps in one.

I'm not sure why you need to use the hwirq here, it should not be visible to
device drivers normally.
Is this the same as enable_irq(pcmcia_schlvl) ?
