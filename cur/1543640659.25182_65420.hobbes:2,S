I'm aware that hyperthreading makes each CPU appear as two. But wouldn't
it be possible to determine this fact and report it to the user to avoid
confusion (not everyone knows about hyperthreading) ?
In the case of 4 HT capable CPU's it could be reported like 
8 CPUs (4 physical) 
or something like that to indicate that there is nothing wrong and the
kernel is simply taking advantage of hyperthreading.
Just my two euro-cents...
