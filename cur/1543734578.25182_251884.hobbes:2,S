It seems to be that this kind of necessitates some sort of kernel mode
driver to handle everything (albeit perhaps with lots of userspace
libs).  I can't see how a generic video acpi driver would play nice
with a userspace X, fbdev, and whever else my be using the hardware. 
It's not that I don't like the idea of letting everyone play I just
want to use my hardware to its fully functionality wihtout a million
kludges everywhere.  OTOH, maybe it'll all just work.  I'm not too
familiar with the ins and outs of ACPI and what's need on the chip
side vs. generic vs. machine specific.  Stuff like enabling outputs
and changine power states is chip specific though and it would need to
play nice.
