A couple of useful resources are:
    
http://www.bitkeeper.com/cvs2bk.html
    
    
http://www.bitkeeper.com/Test.html
    
    
http://news.linuxprogramming.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-02-21-001-06-DT-HT
The last one is Jeff's writeup, very nice.
Also, if you want, one of us can get on IRC while you are walking the demo
and answer your questions.
