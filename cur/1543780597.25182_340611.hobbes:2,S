One brief suggestion:
A key/token interface was recently introduced that might be useful to  
allow
a simple new inheritance model for "capabilities", "roles",  
"rootperms" or
whatever other abstraction you create.

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to  
make it so
simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is  
to make
it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.  The first  
method is
far more difficult.
