Subject: (2/4) [PATCH] cpuset - Kconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here is an improvement to your Kconfig entry.
1. Use dependencies rather than using an 'if x86 || IA64' around it.
2. It is certainly experimental at this point
3. Better descriptive text (hopefully)
4. Let the config system do the PROC_FS dependency, not the human.
