Netfilter compilation fails:
net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_TCPMSS.c: In function `ipt_tcpmss_target':
net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_TCPMSS.c:88: structure has no member named `pmtu'
net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_TCPMSS.c:91: structure has no member named `pmtu'
net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_TCPMSS.c:95: structure has no member named `pmtu'
make[3]: *** [net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_TCPMSS.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [net/ipv4/netfilter] Error 2
make[1]: *** [net/ipv4] Error 2
make: *** [net] Error 2
Fortunately, reconfiguring the kernel halfway the compilation
(turn of TCP MSS netfilter options) and resuming the compile
actually works.
Mike.
