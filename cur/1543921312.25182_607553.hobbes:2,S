That's because I messed up the patch, sorry. The one below should work

USB: usbserial - fix potential deadlock between write() and IRQ
usb_serial_generic_write() doesn't disable interrupts when taking port->lock,
and could therefore deadlock with usb_serial_generic_read_bulk_callback()
being called from interrupt, taking the same lock. Fix it.
