	Hi All!
I've bought new videocard from S3 - S3 Trio3D2X. This card isn't known for
/proc/pci or lspci utility. This card have the following PCI ID:
5333:8a13 - please add to oldpci & lspci.
And now my main problem with this card - when I tried to set better screen
resolution using SVGATextmode 1.8 I found strange thing. I treat this card
in /etc/TextConfig as S3Trio. When I tried to set mode 
"132x43x8_16"      65  1056 1096 1216 1336    688  688  694  714  font  8x16
my monitor turn off. I check up with grabmode what mode I've set and saw that
I've got 130 MHz dot clock instead of 65. I tied several another modes and
every time I've got dot clock twice greater. If anyone know how to set properly
dot clock for this card please reply to me.
	Sincerely Yours, Stanislav Voronyi.
