   (sorry, missed the original post)
   I am using iPod as firewire disk, works fairly OK except of: sometime 
it gets into state when system does not recognize the new SCSI disk (it 
looks like SCSI disk) and nothing helps (unloading modules, 
disconnecting the device etc.), didn't investigate enough to figure out 
why (firewire drivers recognize the device but rescanning scsi doesn't 
find the disk), only reboot helps (out of the options I tried). This is 
not a bug report, just FYI, I don't have enough details to actually ask 
for help...
