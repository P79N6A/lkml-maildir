That I can agree with, and it would make my life easier since I really
only care about the completion of an entire io, not the individual
fragments of it.

I've already got fully async read and write working via a helper thread
for doing the bmaps when the page is not uptodate in the page cache.  The
primatives for async locking of pages and waiting on events such that
converting ext2 to performing full async bmap should be trivial.  Note
that O_NONBLOCK is not good enough because you can't implement an
asynchronous O_SYNC write with it.
