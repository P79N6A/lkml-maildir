Possibly I'm confused about the actual role that these nominees are
running for.  If it's a rigid position in which they don't get to
do anything outside of a specific mandate, then any of the above
would be qualified to represent the kernel community.
However, if there's flexability for a candidate to bring something
new to the position, an online statement from each nominee _Before_ 
the voting begins declaring what they intend to do should they get elected.
Reading out the statement before the summit and also asking people
to vote before that happens seems a little disingenuous.
Can you explain more about what the succesful candidate would actually
do for me, and why I (and others) would want to vote one way or the other?
