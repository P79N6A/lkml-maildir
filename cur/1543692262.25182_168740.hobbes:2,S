hi,
in "Linux Kernel v2.4.22 Configuration", "Traffic Shaper (EXPERIMENTAL)",
the help-function displays the following text:
    To set up and configure shaper devices, you need the shapecfg           
    program, available from <
ftp://shadow.cabi.net/pub/Linux/>
 in the      
    shaper package.   
However:
    $ host shadow.cabi.net
    Host shadow.cabi.net not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
please put in correct address.
thanks,
h.rosmanith
