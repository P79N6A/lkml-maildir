modprobe i2c-viapro # if not built-in
modprobe i2c-dev # if not built-in
i2cdetect -l
i2cdetect <n> # where <n> is the bus number of the VIA SMBus (probably 0
              # in your case)
i2cdetect is part of i2c-tools:

Is there anything like a x86 defconfig? I didn't know. I should
probably take a look and make sure that the defaults for i2c and hwmon
are sane. What is this default configuration meant for? There are so
many different x86 machines out there... Is it supposed to support all
of them, or is it an hardware-neutral base to be extended for every
given machine?

OK, in the bad log I can see a lot of probings for I2C devices from
various drivers (eeprom, pcf8591, w83792d, w83781d, adm1021, etc.) Two
possibilities:
* The probes alone are enough to confuse the network adapter.
* A probe succeeds when it shouldn't and the driver binds to the wrong
  device and breaks it.
The easiest way to tell is to get a list of probes that succeeded. For
this, boot the bad kernel and run:
$ ls -l /sys/bus/i2c/devices/*/driver

Well my guess is that you have included an I2C chip driver with a weak
detection routine. More likely this is a typical case of "if it hurts,
don't do it". But maybe we can improve the help text or default, or
even disable probing for these devices.
At this point I am reasonably certain that the i2c-viapro driver is
innocent.
