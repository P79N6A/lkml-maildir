I understand what he is talking about. There is a bug in cfb_imageblit 
in such that it doesn't allow images of color depths greaters than 8 bpp.
That is image depth. Not framebuffer depth. I just fixed that bug and I 
will be pushing that fix to Andrew Morton for people to test. I haven't 
tested it on big endian yet tho.
