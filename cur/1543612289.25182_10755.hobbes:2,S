Hi, does anyone know how to implement a layered
modularization in Linux?
I've read Alessandro Rubini's book "Linux device
driver". In Chapter 2 of his book he mentioned some
information about stacked modules. But not enough to
develop a Layered modularization. 
Now I need to write a hook module which will hook the
reading/writing operation of /dev/fd0. That means I
want to make a intermediate driver which layers above
or below the driver of /dev/fd0. 
It just like a filter driver in Windows platform.
Any idea will be appreciated.
Best regards,
Michael
