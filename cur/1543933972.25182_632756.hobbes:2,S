As far as I can see, the kernel doesn't behave as it would be, IMO,
normal. I do have HPETs and Linux detects them without any
need for hpet=force (HPET is registered for clockevents), but keeps
LAPIC as the only option for dynticks. It looks like timing devices are
rated and then only one of them is selected for dynticks. But when that
one (here LAPIC) fails to provide the required functionality for nohz,
Linux does not fallback to the next best timer, as dynticks is provided
with only one such device, hence the message "lapic is not functional"
is shown. In fact, this selection process should be fixed.
Before coding my patch, I tried fiddling with that rating algorithm,
but Linux kept locking up during boot. I'll try again, maybe my
approach wasn't correct, but please tell me: is HPET-driven dynticks
code working? (I'm quite confused, as HPET should wake the CPUs even
when in C1E.)

With my patch (the one that disables C1E), powertop shows at most 10-11
wakeups per second when idle (no X server running). Isn't it
reasonable to expect a significant improvement over HZ=100?
