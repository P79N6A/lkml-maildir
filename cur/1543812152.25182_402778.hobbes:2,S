The controller in the bugzilla entry ie a SiI 3114.
It was a quick fix and I did expect more thorough investigation later
(probably 2.6.17 frame). Though it seems FUA-related problems are so
numerous FUA itself will be blacklisted for 2.6.16, so the limited
blacklist is no longer needed.
The thread leading to the blacklist is referenced in the bugzilla entry
