Indeed. An dI would suggest that the shift be limited to at most 9 anyway:
right now I applied the part that disallows non-page-aligned offsets, but
I think that we may in the future allow anonymous mappings again at finer
granularity (somebody made a really good argument about wine for this).
Thinking that the VM mapping shift has to be the same as the page shift is
not necessarily the right thing. With just 9 bits of shift, you still get
large files - 41 bits of files on a 32-bit architecture, and by the time
you want more you _really_ can say that you had better upgrade your CPU.
