http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/gregkh/spi-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=8ae12a0d85987dc138f8c944cb78a92bf466cea0
Thank you for the link, it turns I wasn't right about the meaning...
What I had in mind is to include say the beginning two lines of
Documentation/spi/spi-summary in the first mail (the usual procedure for
patch-00 as I can see):
The "Serial Peripheral Interface" (SPI) is a synchronous four wire serial
link used to connect microcontrollers to sensors, memory, and peripherals.
I always give the -ck patches as an example: even if you don't know what are
they about, what does -ck mean and so on, just reading the first one or two
sentences is enough to decide: to read on or to go next thread.
By seeing this most people will be able to decide whether there are
interested or not and those who are interested should spend the time to find
the patch (learn to use git if needed), etc.
I know we are not talking Web design here, but "Don't let me think" is an
excellent book that I just finished and it teaches exactly what the title
says is a good design, not only web.
And I know Greg posts and comments and everything is very professional, I
know basically who he is and how important he is. /me is mostly reading here
and trying to be helpful, eventually asking for help/explanation of issues I
run into.
Thank you again for the time.
Kalin.
