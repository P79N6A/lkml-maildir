The only thing I've seen kill java like that would be NX things, such as
the NX patch mentioned in an earlier thread; execshield; or PaX.  I saw
some talk about possibly enabling NX by default; but I don't see this in
the -mm6 list, and I have no idea where the bk patch list is.  I
wouldn't expect either Linus or Andrew to have decided to merge an NX
patch in at this stage; but it's a possibility.
Andrew?  Has anything like that been added in the bk tree?
