Thanks Robert for the answer, I'll mark this (clear_page) in my "must to
take a look" list ;)
Well if there is no strong reason of keeping this separate '#define memzero'
I think it's a good case to merge them in some _single_ #define ;)
Waiting for other comments...
P.S.
In a mail you pointed to said that memset(...,0,...) is quite clear -
yes it's quite clear indeed but we already _have_ a lot of '#define memzero'
and who knows or may give the guarantee that new '#define memzero '_will not_'
appear in the kernel.
