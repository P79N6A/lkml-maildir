Dear diary, on Sun, Jun 18, 2006 at 05:47:27AM CEST, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> said that...

I assume that this is with hot cache, which is something you shouldn't
assume for a use like this - you likely aren't in the middle of doing
stuff with the repository but just want to peek at the changes list.
Anyway, the nice thing about the Changelog files MIGHT be Google - it's
nice when googling around about your kernel problem ends up yielding
a changelog entry indicating that it's already fixed in a newer kernel
version. That is, if only Google crawled the changelogs. Does it stay
away of them because they have no extension?
