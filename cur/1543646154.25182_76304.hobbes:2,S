The ulong is definitely wrong. Should be u32.
In general, we are aware of the issues with using 32-bit user-space on top of 
64-bit kernel. If you take a look at evms.c you will find several functions 
that get registered at init-time with the 32-to-64-bit ioctl conversion code. 
These take care of translating pointers from user-space to kernel-space in 
this situation. EVMS has been tested on ppc64 with success, and we have 
someone currently running tests on sparc64 to make sure it works there as 
well.

Correct. In this particular case we are safe, since struct evms_event only 
contains 32bit fields. But we may switch this around anyway just to be even 
safer.

Yep. We'll get those fixed. Thanks for pointing these out.

Thanks for the suggestions!
