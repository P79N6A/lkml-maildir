But the error you report:
	drivers/perfctr/x86.c: In function `finalise_backpatching':
	drivers/perfctr/x86.c:1137: error: parse error before '{' token
is _exactly_ the error you reported before, and it occurs on a line that
assigns CPU_MASK_NONE (via a #define of perfctr_cpus_forbidden_mask) to
a local variable, and this is exactly the error one gets when assigning
the broken version of CPU_MASK_NONE, which was missing the (cpumask_t)
cast, to a local variable.
Somehow, something you are reporting is incorrect.  Or else I am more
mistaken than I am accustomed to being.
Please verify that the above error is indeed the one you are seeing,
and that doing the following command in this build tree:
	grep -1 define.CPU_MASK_NONE include/linux/cpumask.h
produces the following output, including the (cpumask_t) cast:
	#define CPU_MASK_NONE                                                   \
	((cpumask_t){ {                                                         \

                          I won't rest till it's the best ...
