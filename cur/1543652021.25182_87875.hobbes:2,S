That's a funny name for it. Sure about that? Longer description
of what I'm looking for:
    reattaches from reclaim list
        Number of pages that have been faulted while on the inactive list
To me, "pgsteal" sounds like pages grabbed from a clean list to
be used for some new purpose.

They count as minor faults?

How about these then? (and would you want them?)
a. urgency level for the need to free up memory
b. amount (or %) by which the system is overcommitted

Can I assume it will be fixed soon? Is this a value you'd like?

I suspect that it's cycles of the page aging "clock" hand,
not CPU cycles. So that would be pages scanned divided by
the average number of pages in a full scan.

I though so. Bummer. I guess this is due to overhead.

That's fork/vfork/clone all together, w/o execs?
(good for "vmstat -f", but poor for "vmstat -s")
Got one more:
      wired pages
          Total number of pages that are currently in use
          and cannot be used for paging
Thanks for all the help. BTW, you didn't say if you liked the
proposed changes, so I'm assuming they don't matter to you.
