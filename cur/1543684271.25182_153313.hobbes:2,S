Yes, but some future version would.
Since there is no substantial wins in hunting down
such statics, and there is some risk of code bloat when
big inlined statics get called from more that one callsite,
and it will be automatically handled by smarter compiler someday,
I think it makes perfect sense to avoid doing this.
