Well, don't jump too fast :)
I have been having extreme hardware issues with this box for the past 
several hours.  I thought it was 2.5.59 giving me grief but an old 
kernel I had laying around presented similar issues.  I'm busy swapping 
cables, memory, etc to see who is being the bad guy.
So far, I've had issues with reiserfs, raw dd, mkreiserfs, tar, cp, mv 
(insert a lot of shell commands), interpreters, you name it.  Nothing 
seems common except that it all occurs when hda data is going somewhere 
else.  I just swapped my udma66 cable on hda and I'm trying to stress 
test hda now.
