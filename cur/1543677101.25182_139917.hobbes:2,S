I have to disagree here.  The DRI project is still very much alive. 
Over the last few months lots of OpenGL extensions have been added. 
Just recently most drivers got YUV texture and NV texture rectangle
support.  A new configuration system is in the works and progress
continues on mach64, savage, and trident support.  The reason we
haven't seen support for lots of new chips is that no one is funding
development!  It is a volunteer group!  It takes a lot of work to write
a new driver.  There are docs available for quite a few chips, but
someone has to write the driver.

-------------------------
I despair at the DRI project ever getting back in gear -- it's in
horrible
disarray and the development list is now 75% spam. Some good
improvements
came thanks to a donation from the Weather Channel, but it's not enough
to
provide comprehensive support. :-( Maybe there needs to be a "save DRI"
fund. :-/
