	Lots of "soft" drivers, from /dev/lop to FC and iSCSI could
be simplified by using the struct device <--> struct device_driver
rendezvous code.  Under Patrick's propoposed, policy, we would not be
able to get the simplifications in scsi.c, usb.c, or anything else that
could possibly drive a device that was too "soft" for Patrick.
	It is also important for supporting hot plugging that user level
facilities understand that if ide disk #7 was removed that that
poisons /dev/loop/7.
