Okay...I took some time last night to get 2.2.10-pre-3 to compile for
the Rawhide.  Basically I just looked at the two patches and tried to
guess a bit.  I will say, however, that going from 2.2.9 to 2.2.10-pre-3
enabled me to get the rawhide to go from hitting a wall at ~50 AIM VII
users to hitting it at between 150 and 200.  Not a bad performance. 
Anyway, the diff against 2.2.10-pre-3 is below.  The usual warranty
(none) applies.  However, like I said, it survived 150 AIM VII fserver
users, so it's probably not _that_ bad ;)
