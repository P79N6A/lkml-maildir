 They might be using non-standard commands to switch between compression
modes.  For example, DEC TLZ-09 (OEM Sony) drives cannot be switched
between the modes using mt.  They can be switched using jumpers.  They can
be also switched by software under Digital Unix.  The current mode as
reported by mt is always correct, though.
