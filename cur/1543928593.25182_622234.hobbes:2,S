The standard procdure for changing the in-kernel API is to simply break 
the API without any deprecation or advance notice.
Andrew has some strange views that big changes can be done immediately 
while smaller changes should require deprecation periods, but everyone 
else seems to have less strange views.

This does not apply since we do not have a stable in-kernel API, and 
therefore changes to the in-kernel API can by definition not be 
regressions.
2.6.24 most likely contains hundreds of changes and removals of 
in-kernel APIs that existed in 2.6.23.
Are you seriously suggesting that e.g. every single change to any struct 
under include/ [1] would require an announcement x kernel releases 
before it can be implemented?
And yes, things like that would be required if we offered any kind of 
API stability.

[1] even additions would be problematic since buggy external modules 
    might have hardcoded the struct size somewhere...
