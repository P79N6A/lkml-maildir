Also, something which is data i/o intensive is going to be the best
case for a FUSE filesystem.  If you try something which is much more
metadata intensive (i.e., lots of file creates and deletes, chmods,
etc.) like say with a Postmark benchmark, you would almost certainly
get very different results.  That's not to say that bonnie++
benchmarks aren't useful, but when doing comparisons between
filesystems, it's a good idea to use a wide variety of benchmarks to
avoid getting potentially misleading results.
