NFS already syncs on close (and on unlock), so you should just need to
check the return values from any writes, fsyncs, closes, etc. (and
realize that an error there may mean some or all of the previous writes
to this file descriptor failed).  And operations like mkdir have the
same problem--a timeout leaves you not knowing whether the directory was
created, because you don't know whether the operation reached the server
or not.
I assume the problems with executables that Peter Staubach refers to are
due to reads on mmap'd files timing out.
I don't use soft mounts myself and haven't had to debug user problems
with them, so my understanding of it all is purely theoretical--others
will have a better idea when and how these kinds of failures actually
manifest themselves in practice.
