I agree here. And while you are at it: Have it say "not before" vs. "not after".

And if you call "absolute timeout" an "alarm" or "deadline" everyone will agree, 
that this is useful.
Timeout means "I ran OUT of TIME to do it" and this is by definition relative
to a starting point. A "deadline" is an absolute point in (wall) time where sth.
has to be ready and an "alarm" is an absolute point in (wall) time where sth.
is triggered (e.g. a bell rings on your "ALARM clock").
I don't know which person established that non-sense nomenclature about relative
and absolute timouts.
