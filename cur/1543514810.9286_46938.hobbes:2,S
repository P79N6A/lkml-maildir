I'm still developing dtfs altough there has not been much progress in it
during the last few months due to other real-world issues that kept me
from working on it. 
I'm currently doing some tests to find out the effect of write caches in
harddisk devices on LFS implementations since this could be a major issue
when it comes to filesystem layout, for example. (Unfortunately it is too
early to publish any results on that right now.)
