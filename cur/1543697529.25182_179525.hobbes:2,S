It does work fine with 2.4.21, the last part of the log on the mentioned
URL is few hours old.  The hardware looks okay, the box was running for
more than 14 months without any hardware trouble.

I could not find any error logs till now, the BIOS help only says that a
CPU is turned off when a severe error occured.

I cannot promise when I have a chance to test 2.6 there, it's a
production system.
Mfg,
