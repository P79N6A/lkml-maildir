I did not claim that it will be 10 times slower, I said that it will be
slower, my '10 times slower', which are actually '15% of hte total time'
is a reply to your 'fast as sync' model, no need to repaing the picture :)

Ok, I see your point, you insult something you did not ever try to

I know that there is no kevents there, that would be really strange if
you would test it in your environment after all that empty kevent
releases.
Enough, you say micro-thread design is superior - ok, that is your
point.
