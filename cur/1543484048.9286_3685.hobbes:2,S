Uh, to have two interfaces and switch from one to the other and back
quickly and cleanly? To have two interfaces with addresses recognised
as local but with traffic to the net going out of one and traffic
to specific hosts going out the other?

So? The point is that Linux didn't. Now it does. The change breaks
things for some people. Their past expectations are no longer valid.
Worst of all there seem to be some issues which can only be addressed
using the undocumented ip tool. (I'll mention those in another
message :-) )

Nah. If there's a standard, great. Otherwise someone still needs to
explain to me why it is necessary to have all this magic happening
in the kernel rather than, say, ifconfig.

If you honestly don't know why not go read some of the ISDN docs
and find out?
