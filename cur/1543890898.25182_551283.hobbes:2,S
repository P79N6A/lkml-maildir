Subject: [RFC 0/4] CONFIG_STABLE to switch off development checks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

A while back we talked about having the capability of switching off checks
like the one for kmalloc(0) for stable kernel releases. This is a first stab
at such functionality. It adds #ifdef CONFIG_STABLE for now. Maybe we can
come up with some better way to handle it later. There should alsol be some
way to set CONFIG_STABLE from the Makefile.
CONFIG_STABLE switches off
- kmalloc(0) check in both slab allocators
- SLUB banner
- Makes SLUB tolerate object corruption like SLAB (not sure if we really want
  to go down this route. See patch)
