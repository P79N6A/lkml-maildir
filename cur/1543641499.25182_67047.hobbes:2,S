Yah I saw your previous post.  There is also a report or two re oops on
poisoned memory with SLAB_DEBUG and preempt enabled - which should be
fixed by the above return but one report says it does not.
Anyhow, your new methods are fine... if they work, they work.
I am starting to get concerned over the number of routines we are having
to define.  It is getting complicated (i.e. the
inc_preempt_non_preempt() stuff).
Maybe keep these local to mm/slab.c ?
