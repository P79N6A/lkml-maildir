I just checked s_show in kernel/kallsyms.c and I can not see how it 
could BUG without BUG'ing in s_next first, because that function only 
formats the information that has been gathered by s_next.

My bet goes to slab's s_show, too. Besides, that code in kallsyms has 
been like that for a very long time, IIRC.
