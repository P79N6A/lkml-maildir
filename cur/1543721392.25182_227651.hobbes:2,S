The system has a gig of RAM and a gig of swap, so I don't think it's
running out of space.  Also, ld segfaults immediately after being
invoked, not midway through the link.
As for the memory check, it's a brand new system, but I'll run the check
anyway later today when I get a chance.
Thanks for the tips so far.
