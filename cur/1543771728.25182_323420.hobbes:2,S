I can't see any way that a null pointer could get to filp_open without 
something already being very wrong - the kernel worked fine before 
suspend. Unfortunately, that's the one occasion that we've got the 
machine (an HP nc4000) to resume. Since then, it simply freezes before 
hitting "Back to C" despite having had no kernel or configuration 
changes. The behaviour is very non-deterministic, which makes me wonder 
about something in the suspend or resume process damaging state.
