Subject: [BK PATCH] Driver Core patches for 2.6.10-rc1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
Here are a few minot driver core changes for 2.6.10-rc1 that were laying
around and didn't make it in the last big batch of merges.  Most of
these have been in the -mm tree for a while now.
No, they don't include the backing store sysfs patches, I'll get to
those next week.  I'll be in the same building as Maneesh, so I know
he'll be hounding me about them... :)
Oh, and these patches will cause the wait_for_sysfs program in udev to
start spiting out a lot more warnings.  It's not a bug in the kernel,
it's a userspace issue.  I'll get that fixed up in the next udev
release.
Please pull from:

thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
