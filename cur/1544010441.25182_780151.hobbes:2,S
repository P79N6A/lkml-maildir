that reminds me ... did you know about hardirq_count()? We could use it 
to detect IRQ entries in a more generic way, instead of the section 
trick?
Another thing, i just noticed that ftrace_print() is broken in certain 
situations, for example a plain newline:
        ftrace_printk("\n");
printed via trace_pipe will print some weirdly concatenated line:
           <...>-2994  [007]   406.498986: debug_show:          <...>-2994  [007]   406.498986:            <...>-2994  [007]   406.498986: debug_show: 
not via a separate, standalone, empty line.
Another thing: it would be nice to have a trace_option to leave out this 
preamble:
           <...>-2994  [007]   406.498986: debug_show:  test printk
and just give this output:
 test printk
i.e. some 'printk compatibility' mode. That way i could use 
ftrace_printk() as a pure replacement for printk, during development.
