Subject: exported fb_find_logo references __initdata

fb_find_logo() refences a few structs marked as __initdata. The structs
itself have a member ->data which is marked as __initdata as well.
scripts/pnmtologo.c write_footer() and write_header() create those
structs.
What is the correct fix, and why does it work at all?
