 Well, the only thing I can say is that it works with the same source
 but an older version of gcc. I can't even tell you WHERE exactly this
 happens because it really seems random, i.e. not everywhere memcpy
 is called it's also unreferenced. 
 I get this messages:

 Not using ISDN curbs this problem, but without ISDN my server would
 be just a lifeless box making a lot of noise. :/
 The only possibility to get this working at the moment is to compile
 the kernel on a machine with gcc 2.95.2.
