Sort of.  If Xen weren't an issue, then both cases are a matter of 
copying a set of entries from one place in the pgd to another.
It would be easy enough to add some code on xen side to look for pmd 
aliases when using/pinning a pagetable, and allocate'n'copy a new pmd 
page as needed.  That way the core code can ignore the issue.
