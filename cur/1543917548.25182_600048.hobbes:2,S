No, they don't attempt to do that, but I suspect they put in place
infrastructure which could be used to improve direct-reclaimer latency.  In
the throttle_vm_writeout() path, at least.
Do you know where the stalls are occurring?  throttle_vm_writeout(), or via
direct calls to congestion_wait() from page_alloc.c and vmscan.c?  (running
sysrq-w five or ten times will probably be enough to determine this)
