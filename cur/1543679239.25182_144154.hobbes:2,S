I installed debian and it couldn't boot bk24 (kernel 2.4) at install, so I have
like 1 reiserfs partition (created afterwards,  because at the time I had
10 gig free) and the rest are ext3.  ext3 is VERY slow.  I know, it's not
THAT slow, but... I have like 5 partitions on each disk, and 2 disks.  So,
take off swap and reiserfs, like 6 at one time.  Painful.

reiserfs is the filesytem that servers should use.  It has the least latency
these days ;-) And it's quite stable.

Some of us are walking brains with very shallow pockets.

The filesystem code wouldn't be much more complicated.  The changes
needed for this would all be in a separate source file anyway.  Most of the
complicated crap is all in the code for the datasystem that manages the
two filesystems that suddenly exist in the same space.
