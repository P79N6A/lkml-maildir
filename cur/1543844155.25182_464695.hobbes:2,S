Yes, 5 bytes is not an atomic write except on 64-bit. So a race is possible.
How about this workaround:
1. Overwrite the start of the function with a hlt, which is atomic.
2. Write that 5-byte jump after the hlt.
3. Overwrite the hlt with nop so things will work
4. interrupt any cpus that got stuck on the hlt - or just wait for the 
timer.
