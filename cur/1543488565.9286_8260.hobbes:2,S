Instead of tying this to a filesystem full condition, the user's disk
quota could be used as a trigger, with files in the user's trashcan
still counted against their quota.
This would allow a user with 100 MB of quota to live dangerously with
all 100 MB devoted to live data and an always empty trashcan, or 1 MB
or live data and 99 MB of backup in their trashcan directory.
If ext2 supported versioned files, the trashcan could also contain files
thesis.tex.1 through thesis.tex.<bignum> as a cheesy substitute for
real revision control.
