On the other hand - the latencies caused by tracing output itself should be 
quite low, correct? If not then that needs fixing too. So i've picked up 
your change - lets see how useful the result is.
But "if it hurts, disable tracing before reading the tracing result" method 
you expressed is really not acceptable.
