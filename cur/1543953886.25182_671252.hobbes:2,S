How is a driver supposed to prevent calls to probe()? You can block in probe()
or you can fail it, but how do you prevent it from being called? User space
can trigger probe via sysfs. To be useful to driver writers, this has
to be clarified.

This could be understood so that disconnect() cannot be called.

Probably it should be mentioned that this is the time to allocate memory
if you have to. And it is too late to request firmware.
