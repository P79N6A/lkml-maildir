There is one mailing list where this kind of discussion probably
would be welcome, the kernelnewbies mailing list. Personally I'd
really like more things related to BSD, Hurd and other freely
available systems on the kernelnewbies mailing list, irc channel,
etc.  I might have founded #kernelnewbies to help people with Linux
questions, but it was never my intention to limit it to Linux
kernel stuff only.

I can recommend Understanding the Linux Kernel, 2nd edition.
Other people have recommended various other kernel related
books, you can find a small list on:
