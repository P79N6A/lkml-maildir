Yes.  If you get the coding style wrong, it's harder for all of us to
review the code.  See my old OLS paper about coding style for the
research that backs this up.  
Basically, if the format is wrong, your brain has a much harder time to
see the actual logic of your code.  And you want us to review the logic
:)
