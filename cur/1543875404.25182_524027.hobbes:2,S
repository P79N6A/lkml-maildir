This is because the kernel permits all of its allotment of dirty+writeback
pages to be dirty+writeback against a single device.
A good way of solving the one-device-starves-another-one problem is to
dynamically adjust the per-device dirty+writeback levels so that (for
example) if two devices are being written to, each gets 50% of the
allotment.
I started working on that but got derailed by the usual blah.  I don't
think either of the proposed fixes took that approach, actually.
