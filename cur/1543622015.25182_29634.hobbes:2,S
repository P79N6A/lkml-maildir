	WDIOC_SETTIMEOUT is defined as being in seconds.  This is
commented in linux/watchdog.h against the WDIOF_SETTIMOUT flag.  Where
you see funky math against the passed parameter is where a watchdog card
takes strange values on its hardware and the driver is computing the
proper strange value for the given amount of seconds.
	Also note that WDIOC_SETTIMEOUT rounds up to the nearest second
interval the watchdog can handle if the watchdog cannot support the
passed interval.  For this reason, it always returns the actual timeout
set in the passed int*.  This is usually done with the fall-through to
the WDIOC_GETTIMEOUT code.
	You don't see WDIOC_SETTIMEOUT in 2.4.17 because it was added in
2.4.18pre.
