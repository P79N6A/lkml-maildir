Hi people I'm trying to figure this out but can't seem to find any info.
So could someone help me with this question: What kernel versions will 
allow files larger than 4 GB? What filesystems?
ps I am new to the linux kernel development is there a specification of 
the various kernel versions?
Greets,
Iwan Sanders
