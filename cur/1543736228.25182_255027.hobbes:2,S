Which is what makes the difference, I think.  IMO, the problem is that _both_ 
CPUs use the same memory bank that is physically attached to only one of them 
which leads to conflicts, apparently (the CPU with memory has also 
PCI/AGP/whatever attached to it via HyperTransport so I can imagine there may 
be issues with overlapping address spaces etc.).  I'd bet that there's 
something wrong either with the BIOS or with the board design itself and I 
don't think there's anything that the kernel can do about it (usual 
disclaimer applies).
Out of couriosity: have you tried to run the kernel with K8 NUMA enabled?
