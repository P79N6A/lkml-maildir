Nonetheless, the current SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM scheme should go. A) it's in
the IRQ fast path B) most of its users are bogus which strongly
indicates it's a bad API.
Instead (if we want network entropy) we should add an
add_network_randomness call in some central location in the network
stack (probably right next to netpoll's RX hooks) and probably have it
compiled out by default.
