Hi,
Just some nitpicking at the description, will cover the patches next.

Well, I don't think that cpufreq_driver is the "natural" point -- in fact,
I think it is one of the worst points for the interaction. My alternative
suggestion will be the last one of the many mails you'll likely receive from
me today :)

cpufreq is arch independent, as can be seen that it is used by many
different architectures right now.

Have you considered the drivers which do not use the frequency table helper
library in cpufreq?

Also for the case where there are thousands of frequency states? Or only a
range to be set, and a in-CPU-mode [longrun]? There's a reason this export
is optional.

That sounds like a good step forward -- especially as sysdevs may actually
be removed soon. It's orthogonal to the other changes though; i.e. we could
do that with the current cpufreq core without switching to PowerOP/"PM
core".

arch independent? Well, this helper library is used by different archs already...
Thanks,
