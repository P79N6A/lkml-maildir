Subject: RFC: Remove the arm26 port

Considering the state of the arm26 port, I do hereby suggest to remove 
it from the Linx kernel since it's far from a usable state and doesn't 
seem to come back into a usable state.
If anyone wants to work on getting this port back into a usable state in 
the forseeable future he should speak up now.
