It seems like your patch unfortunately went into 2.6.9-rc2-mm[3,4] and 
2.6.9-rc3.
My Natsemi network card stops working with 2.6.9-rc3. After succesfully 
revoking your patch from 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.9-rc2/2.6.9-rc2-mm3/broken-out/natsemi-remove-compilation-warnings.patch
everything works fine.
Andrew and Linus, please revoke that one in mainline and mm.
Thanks.
Franz
