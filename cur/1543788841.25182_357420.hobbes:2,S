Hmmhh, I already compiled 2.6.14-rc4 but did not disable
soft-lockup-ing, should I still do it - the oops looks better as it is
not followed by a ATAPI reset anymore:
eth0: Link is up at 1000 Mbps, full-duplex.
eth0: Pause is enabled (rxfifo: 10240 off: 7168 on: 5632)
BUG: soft lockup detected on CPU#0!

Sometimes, there's a moment as you're waking, when you become aware of
the real world around you, but you're still dreaming.
