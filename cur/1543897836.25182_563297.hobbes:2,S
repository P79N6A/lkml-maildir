It's nice if you can do so, but I wouldn't suggest that you _have_ to.
I have to admit that I rarely bother actually wiring new system calls up
on anything but PowerPC to start with.
The important thing is that you've _considered_ the other architectures,
and the 32/64 compatibility implications. As long as the API of your new
system call is sensible and takes that kind of thing into account, it
should be fine.
Had you considered changing the API so that you don't need the
compatibility wrapper at all? Could you take an integer number of µS or
ms instead of a struct timespec?
