This means holding the l3->list_lock for a prolonged time period. The 
existing code was done this way in order to make sure that the interrupt 
holdoffs are minimal.
There is no pounding. The cacheline with the list_lock is typically held 
until the draining is complete. While we drain the freelist we need to be 
able to respond to interrupts.
