Hi,
I can't get any kernel up to 2.6.20-rc5 to boot without using noapic on
an ABIT KN9-Ultra with a dual-core Athlon.
I booted with apic=debug as suggested and got the following :
ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
.. TIMER: vector=0x31 apic1=0 pin1=0 apic2=-1 pin2=-1
.. MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
... trying to set up timer (IRQ0) through the 8252A ... failed
... trying to set up timer as Virtual Wire IRQ ... failed
... trying to set up timer as ExtINT IRQ ... failed :(
The bios is the latest, although in various posts on the web it would
appear this occurs in older versions also.
What can I do to help resolve this?
Cheers,
Eamonn
