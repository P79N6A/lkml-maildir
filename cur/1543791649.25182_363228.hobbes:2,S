Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

What follows is a long sequence of mostly small patches to implement
PCI Error Recovery by adding notification callbacks to the PCI device
driver structure, implementing the recovery in 5 device drivers
(3 ethernet, two scsi drivers), and adding the actual error detection
and recovery code to the ppc64/powerpc arch tree.
Highlights:
-- Patches 1-14: Misc required ppc64/powerpc cleanup/bugfixes/restructuring
-- Patch 15: Overview documentation
-- Patch 16: changes to include/linux/pci.h
-- Patches 17-26: error detection and recovery for pSeries PCI bridge chips
-- Patchs 27-32: recovery patches for ethernet, scsi device drivers
-- Patches 33-42: More misc ppc64-specific changes
