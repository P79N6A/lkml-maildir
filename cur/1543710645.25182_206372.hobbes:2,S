Duh of course, that's pretty silly actually. So the question is if we
want to keep assigning a dummy unplug_io_fn (default_backing_dev already
has it), or just keep the check. I propose to check like Chris added,
and just kill the default_unplug_io_fn() from readahead.c
Thanks for fixing this Chris, I wonder why your back trace from this
oops was so screwy (->unplug_io_fn() for the swap space was zero-filled,
no?)
