Hi!
I'd like to report a bug, too. On my system, with the test10 kernel,
regardless of what frequency the software sets, the data is always
played at 48 KHz.
Via 686a audio driver 1.1.14
ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, id: 0x574d:0x4c00 (Wolfson WM9704)
via82cxxx: board #1 at 0xDC00, IRQ 10
The codec doesn't support variable rate input, as far as I know. Could
that be the cause?
