 Well, this is actually not a problem with the watchdog itself.  And I'd 
rather say it's doing us a favour (and a great job) finding these buggy 
bits of code that keep interrupts off CPUs. ;-)
 Otherwise NMIs should be completely transparent.  Well, yeah, that's 
theory -- for this to be the case we'd have to use a task gate which is 
rather time consuming and using an interrupt gate means we need to take 
some explicit care elsewhere indeed.
 OTOH, we can always get an NMI from the chipset in response e.g. to a bus 
error of some kind (unfortunately it's often impossible to reroute these 
errors to a more useful interrupt, like an MCE), so we need to be prepared 
for one at any time.  But these errors are expected to be rare, so it's 
hard to test their effects, unlike these of the watchdog.

 The problem with the SMM as currently used by BIOSes is unfortunately the 
design, not any particular implementation.
