I wrote an easy-to-chew article[1] about PaX on Wikipedia, although
looking back at it I think there may be some erratta in the ASLR
concept; I think the mmap() base is randomized, but I'm not sure now if
the actual base of each mmap() call is individually randomized as shown
in my diagrams.  I'm also no longer sure where I got the notion that the
heap/.bss/data segments are the same entity, and I'll have to check on that.
Nevertheless, it's basically accurate, in the same way that saying you
have a gameboy advance SP when you just have a gameboy advance is
basically accurate.
