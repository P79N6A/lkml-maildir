Even if it is the fastest way to use the API, iI would still prefer such
behaviour to be encoded in wrapper libraries instead of inside the API
itself. Having a choice is usually better that not having it, if the cost
for having a choice is not too much ( and in this particular case is not ).

Same thing, I would leave this task to your my_socket() and my_accept().
I think what is really missing about /dev/epoll is an easy-to-use
interface library to avoid users confused by the presence of "poll" inside
its name, to use it like select()/poll().

Yes, it creates a mapping shared between the kernel and the user space.
