You missed that SYMBIOS devices can be attached by RAID firmware and,
that, in such situation, the kernel should avoid tampering the SYMBIOS
device. The [ncr|sym]53c8xx drivers are aware of that, and donnot attach
SYMBIOS devices owned by RAID.
If the pci_enable_device() thing is to be added to the drivers, it must
preferently be placed after the checking against RAID attachement.
(look for 0x52414944 in the driver source which is the signature tested by
the drivers, or look into beta SYM-2).
