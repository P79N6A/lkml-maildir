Well, that's what a max_ parameter implies ;p
A manually set limit of loop devices is ok with me. (32 was just an
example -- After all, I could have chosen 256 just to annoy some
people :-)
And with the recent hype of creating things when needed, or even
recycling already used ones (sdx), I worry that this impacts
stability or even usability as a whole. (yes, it's a -rc release ...)
I'll be staying with 2.6.20.x for a year or so. Get the newly
introduced bugs squashed before they have a chance to bug me, heh ;P
PS: Just wondering: Who came up with this "on-demand" hype?
