An update:
Ingo's 2.6.23 version of the latency-tracing-patches only lock-up on resume here.
But now that I've hacked vmware to work on 2.6.24,
my notebook is now running the newer kernels.
So now to see if the "strange 1-second pauses" ever happen here,
and if they do I'll patch in Ingo's stuff to try and find out why.
