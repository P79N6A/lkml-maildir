Hi Rusty,
There are many instances in the tree of functions that have no callers 
whatsoever because they've been commented out temporarily, disabled 
through configuration, etc.  These are marked __attribute__ ((unused)) 
right now so that the compiler doesn't emit a warning (and with gcc >=3.4 
it doesn't even emit code for them).  What's __optional about these 
functions if they have no callers?  They're unused.  So we cover all our 
bases with __maybe_unused.
