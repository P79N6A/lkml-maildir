You'll need to specify 128MB - 384kB at most with ThinkPads in my
experience.  You could just use the #k reported by the BIOS on bootup,
or, as others have suggested, just specify 127MB.  This has always
worked for me on 760s, 770s, and 600s.
Now, why Linux 2.2 can't autodetect ThinkPad's memory is another
issue...
