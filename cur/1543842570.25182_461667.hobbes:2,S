Do we really want it under /proc? It would seem to make more sense for 
it to be under /sys.

What gets generated if I rip a drive out without notifying the system 
beforehand? Dell hardware doesn't appear to send any event when poking 
the eject lever.
The way I originally implemented this was to tie it into the libata 
layer directly. With a small amount of glue it's possible to tie a 
hotswap bay to a specific sata port, and use the event to trigger a 
hotplug rescan. Doing it in kernel space means that the device can be 
destroyed the moment it's removed, reducing the possibility that further 
writes will be made. There was some amount of resistance to acpi 
integration in the scsi layer, though I think we eventually reached a 
compromise about providing support for platform firmware hooks.
Doing it this way also means that the bay itself can be represented in 
sysfs as an attribute under the appropriate port. That seems more 
natural than having the bay be entirely separate, despite ACPI providing 
us with the information for them to be tied together.
