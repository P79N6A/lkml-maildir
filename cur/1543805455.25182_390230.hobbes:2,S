Well, you need to implement 30 (or so) platform-specific ways to get a
list of devices, and portable applications aren't going to do that. To
make it explicit: no way. It is a maintenance nightmare, 30 lowly-tested
pieces of code, too.
This sounds like a huge difference, but I don't believe it actually is.
Jörg is trying to fight the system rather than stop complaining to users
about their using /dev/hd*. The scanning code is there and can be made
working with little effort probably.
