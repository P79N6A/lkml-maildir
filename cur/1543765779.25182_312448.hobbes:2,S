I think most important thing for carrier system is service availability.
The live patch only stops process(which have 3 threads) 180 nanoseconds 
with 2functions, 2 variable changes on my linux desktop(Xeon 2.8G dual). 
(on sample 1)
I believe process status copy consume more time, may be below sequences 
are needed;
- Stop the service on ACT-process.
- Copy on memory/on transaction status to shared memory.
- Takeover shared memory key to SBY process and release the shared memory
- SBY process access to shared memory.
- SBY process checks the memory and reset broken sessions.
- SBY process restart the service.
Some part may be parallelize, but seems the more data make service 
disruption time longer...(It seems exceeds 100 milliseconds depends on 
data size..)
and process will be more complicated....makes more bugs...
