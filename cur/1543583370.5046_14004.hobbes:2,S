Despite my limited knowledge of the src code for buffering and block
devices I have made an patch which fixes the LVM problem for me.  I'm
not 100% sure it is correct and if it is the clean solution.  Some
kernel god should therefore take a look on it.  At least I have
running it here in my kernel.
