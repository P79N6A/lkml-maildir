Hi,
 I tried to compile linux-2.4.5ac17 with processor type "Athlon"
 settings.
 Compilation/Install was successful. But boot produces dozens of
 "unresolved symbols" if trying to insmod any of the modules.
 Not one module was insmodded successfully.
 I tried PENTIUM III setting, which works fine.
 What's goiing on here ;-)
 What is it, what I am doing wrong.
 The modutils version is 2.4.6
 Any help VERY welcone ;-)
 Thank you very much in advance !
   keep hacking the right site of life ! :-)
