Hello, 
  I have these strange spurious interrupts with 2.4.17 + low latency patch 
too on PII 450 with 256 MB RAM. No oopses yet, but when I try to burn CD's, 
my PS/2 mouse starts to act funny (jumps all over the screen under XFree) and 
the burner usually burns garbage (=unreadable CD's). Seems like some IRQ 
conflict to me, but according to /proc/interrupts, there is none. BTW, 
enabling or disabling the low latency patch via /proc makes no difference. 
I can send more info if needed.
