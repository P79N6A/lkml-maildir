Subject: why does selecting ACPI now require PNP?

in the current thread 'long term regression' we're troubleshooting 
printing problems that seem to be triggered by ACPI_PNP. in sometime 
between 2.6.18 and 2.6.22 configuring ACPI started forcing ACPI_PNP even 
if PNP was otherwise disabled.
given the recent discussion on ACPI forcing HOTPLUG_CPU I thought it 
appropriate to ask the question of why configuring ACPI should then enable 
PNP?
