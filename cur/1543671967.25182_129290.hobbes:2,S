Is it worth the effort. Why not just let the old isa stuff live out its
life in peace ? There is certainly no reason we couldnt make it more
driver model like by splitting probe and activity
ie ne2000 probing would do
	poke around for ISA device
	Found one ?
		Alloc isadevice
		Fill in ports/range/irq
		Fill in vendor/product with invented idents
		Announce it
Then have ne2000 driver model code do the actual setup
