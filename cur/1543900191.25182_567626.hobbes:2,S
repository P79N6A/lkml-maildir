As for Makefiles: Sort the list lexicographically. Let the submitter put
it into the right spot.
Example: net/netfilter/Makefile.
There are lots of obj-$(CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_xyz) += xt_xyz.o for example,
which can be sorted without disturbing required linking order or whatnot
(for some directories this seems important).
Benefit: Less rejects of course (not as much as a truly random insert,
but still less than appending) _and_ a sorted list.
