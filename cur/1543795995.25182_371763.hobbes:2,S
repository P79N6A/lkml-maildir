You are still reporing free pages.  Do you seen the OOM killer killing
processes?
How big is the file you are doing your test on?  How big is your
filesize var when the box hangs?
If you run this test without nfs (on a local file system) do you end
up in this low memory state as well or only over a nfs mount?
thanks,
 Keith
