The idea was to get rid of the dasdxyz names which are not intuitive.

Ok.

That is probably the main argument to go back to the old names. After
udev and friends are in place it is not important how the disk is named
internally. The only place where it would surface is on the root=
parameter.
I'll discuss this with the Horst again to see if we really need the
dasd_<busid>_ names or if we can live with the old style names on the
root= parameter.
