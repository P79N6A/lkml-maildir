Many embedded platforms do not map VGA resources in, so it is not 
possible to get VGACon to work on those machines unless the kernel/boot 
loader is modified to properly map VGA resources (which should be 
possible).
Then there are Macintosh machines that also do not map VGA resources. I 
am not sure if it is possible to map them on Macintosh machines or not.
I would assume however a serial port console would be fine for embedded 
machines until the framebuffer driver could come up anyway.

As long as this process happens quickly and the machine boots into 
graphics mode within 1-2 seconds from poweron, that would probably be OK. 
If it starts taking too long for the system to get into graphics mode to 
display something the user can easily think something is wrong and the 
machine is not working.
