Yes.  I thought about using PG_nosave in the begining, but there's a
BUG_ON(PageReserved(page) && PageNosave(page));
in swsusp.c:saveable() that I just didn't want to trigger.  It seems to me,
though, that we don't need it any more, do we?

Yes, I think I'll just port the Nigel's patch to x86-64.  BTW, it's striking
that we found similar solutions independently (I didn't know the Nigel's
patch before :-)).
Unfortunately, it turns out that the patch does not fix my problem with random
reboots during resume on battery power, but I really think that we need to mark
non-RAM areas with PG_nosave, at least for sanity reasons (eg to be sure that
we do not break things by dumping stuff to where we should not write to).
Greets,
Rafael
