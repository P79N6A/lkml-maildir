Indeed, there won't be a 2.96 (or 2.97, 3.0) very soon, for, ehrm, "minor
lack of developer resources".
There is currently discussion on wether to release a 2.95.3 with all the
bugfixes found on the 2.95 release branch. (I'm all in favour of it).
I haven't checked wether that particular bug was fixed in the 2.95 branch,
though.

There are many versions of gcc without that bug, and if all suffer from
the same bug it is relatively unimportant ;) So up or downgrading should
be an option. Or waiting for the next release.
