Yes we have no need for %fs and %gs.  Lumping them in with the rest is
just extra helpfulness.
Basically be conservative in what you send (all segments).
Be liberal in what you accept (%cs,%ds,%es,%ss) and less if
we can get away with it.

I'm thinking we just make the code start.
startup_32:
	movl	%cs, %eax
        testl   $3, %eax
        jnz     1f
	lgdt boot_gdt_descr - __PAGE_OFFSET
	movl $(__BOOT_DS),%eax
	movl %eax,%ds
	movl %eax,%es
	movl %eax,%fs
	movl %eax,%gs
        movl %eax,%ss

But that won't work if we want to support relocatability.
Because we can't load a gdt if we don't know where we are.
To find out where we are we need %ss and %ds, at which point
we might as well assume we have %es to.
I think that will work in the elilo case but we can't reload them.
As silly elilo loaded a new gdt but not it's segments...
So be it then.  The next rev of the boot protocol gets to be partially
incompatible, and we just assume that %cs, %ds, %es, %ss meet our
basic requirements.  I'm pretty certain from what I saw only Gujin
is going to suffer  :(
Yep it is long past time that we document what needs to happen for
the 32bit entry point of the linux kernel.
