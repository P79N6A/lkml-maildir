Hello,
	The kernel I just compiled is the 2.4.18 kernel. LILO deals with the large
drive fine when booting the previous 2.2.19 kernel. I compiled the new one
from scratch with no networking support and very little else. The problem
basically occurs right at boot, it doesn't matter if I use a floppy to boot
or my haddrive. The problem with the harddrive is that I'll get a loading
vmlinuz-2.4.18......... and then it reboots. I haven't been able to pause it
to get a clear picture of what is happening. The floppy is a little easier
because what happens is that it says Loading, gives a series of dots and
then reboots. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in
advance for suggestions.
	I am not on the mailing list, so please direct responses to my personal
email amirk@ucla.edu thanks
