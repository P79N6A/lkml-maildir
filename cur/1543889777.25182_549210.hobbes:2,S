Basically this flag applies to drivers which is SFF compliant, at least
at TF interface level.  There also are other flags/callbacks which only
apply to SFF or BMDMA.  It would be nice to separate them out in the
long term and yeah it needs documentation.

It covers all the known cases but I agree that SFF specific things
certainly need documentation.
Thanks.
