Yes. But I know people send private emails because they don't want to 
create a scare, so I think we actually have several levels of lists:
 - totally open: linux-kernel, or an alternative with lower noise
   We've kind of got this, but things get lost in the noise, and "white 
   hat" people don't like feeling guilty about announcing things.
 - no embargo, no rules, but "private" in the sense that it's supposed to 
   be for kernel developers only or at least people who won't take 
   advantage of it.
   _I_ think this is the one that makes sense. No hard rules, but private 
   enough that people won't feel _guilty_ about reporting problems. Right 
   now I sometimes get private email from people who don't want to point
   out some local DoS or similar, and that can certainly get lost in the
   flow.
 - _short_ embargo, for kernel-only. I obviously believe that vendor-sec 
   is whoring itself for security firms and vendors. I believe there would 
   be a place for something with stricter rules on disclosure.
 - vendor-sec. The place where you can play any kind of games you want.
It's not a black-and-white thing. I refuse to believe that most security 
problems are found by people without any morals. I believe that somewhere 
in the middle is where most people feel most comfortable.
