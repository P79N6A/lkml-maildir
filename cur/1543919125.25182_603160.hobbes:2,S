One of the things that zero-page has been used for is absolutely *huge* 
(but sparse) arrays in Fortan programs.
At least in traditional fortran, it was very hard to do dynamic 
allocations, so people would allocate the *maximum* array statically, and 
then not necessarily use everything. I don't know if the pages ever even 
got paged in, but this is the kind of usage which is *not* insane.
