Hmm. That seems to be a problem, as part of our work, we get a lot of
files through ftp. We then need to sort them in exact time order, which
means accuracy down to the microsecond is required as the ftp transfer
runs so quickly that files gets saved with the same time_t value. Doesn't
matter, I'll do an extra sort on the filenames anyway for the same time
range.
We could do with a much more precise time_t structure for the future,
methinks.
Cheers, 
Alex
