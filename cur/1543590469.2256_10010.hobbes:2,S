Wouldn't it be better to fix tmpfs/ramfs to report something sensible,
even if it's artificial?  Perhaps reporting the cardinality of the
directory, if that happens to be easily available.
N.B.: X/KDE will not run on a ramfs, because it reports as a size-zero
filesystem in "df".  Switching to tmpfs solved that for me.
