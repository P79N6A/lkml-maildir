When I first read this out out of context, I wondered if you were saying
that any executable that I write on my libc5 linux system (and those that
were compiled on libc5 systems long ago - like my copy of Adobe acrobat,
and RealNetworks real audio) must have been distributed under GPL?
    [ Please recall that the kernel header files were included in users
    programs (since /usr/include/asm and /usr/include/linux were symlinks
    into the kernel sources) and common include files like dirent.h,
    errno.h, and signal.h.  This still works with libc5 and todays
    Linux 2.4.23. ]
You must not be saying that, since Linus said:
    "There's a clarification that user-space programs that use the standard
    system call interfaces aren't considered derived works, but even that
    isn't an "exception" - it's just a statement of a border of what is
    clearly considered a "derived work". User programs are _clearly_
    not derived works of the kernel, and as such whatever the kernel
    license is just doesn't matter."
And after re-reading more of the thread, you must be refering to modules
that include kernel include files, right?
