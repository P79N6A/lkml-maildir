Subject: [patch-2.3.43-pre8] saving 222 bytes of kernel code.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Linus,
After studying the replies I received on the first iteration of my
vhangup(2) optimization patch I produced another version:
   
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches/vhangup-2.3.43-p8.patch
It saves 222 bytes of kernel code and produces smaller and faster
sys_vhangup() function. There is no need to handle the case of no ctty
specially because the low-level routine does that already and the call
overhead is worth it because processes without ctty are rarer than those
with.
(apologies for forgetting about #include <linux/smp_lock.h> in a couple of
places yesterday - I noticed you corrected this yourself)
Regards,

PS. Think about it - with a bunch (4096) of hackers removing 222 bytes of
code a day - we will reduce (static) kernel size to 0 in 2 days :)
