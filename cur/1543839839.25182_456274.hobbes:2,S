Yeah, I know you do. =)

Well, I cannot explain it well myself. But if you try setting CS to
something else than 0x18 and start the x86_64 kernel using startup_64
you will see what I am talking about. It does not work. 
A good example of when this doesn't work is when my page_table_a patches
are used on x86_64 to boot a vmlinux. It does not work because CS is set
to something else then __KERNEL_CS.
Things just happen to work in most cases today (excluding being rebooted
from Xen) because either
a) vmlinux is booted and CS is set to 0x18 by Linux before kexec:ing.
or
b) bzImage is booted (32 bit entry point)

I'm not talking about running Linux under Xen, this is a standard
non-virtualized kernel that is started _from_ a Xen environment using
kexec-tools. Think kdump kernel being started by the Xen hypervisor on
panic. Does that make sense?
