Subject: Still no ramfs usage limits in 2.5.9 or 2.4.19-pre8

David Gibson produced a patch about 18 months ago that added usage limits
to ramfs.  <
http://ozlabs.org/people/dgibson/dwg-ramfs.patch>
Through 2.4.10, the AC kernel series carried this patch.
Linus' kernel from 2.4.11 onward adopted only one line from the
patch, the following attribution comment:
	"Usage limits added by David Gibson, Linuxcare Australia."
The usage limit code is missing, however.
Was this a simple mistake that has been overlooked?  Or are there
drawbacks to applying the patch that keep it out of the mainstream
kernels?
