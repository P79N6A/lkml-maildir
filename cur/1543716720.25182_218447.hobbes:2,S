The patch also applies cleanly to kernel 2.6.5, which is what I am running. 
The machine is now running for more than 21 hours with APIC enabled and it 
seems it is completely stable now. Without the patch I was able to lock the 
system solid in less than a minute by just pushing some MB of data across the 
LAN. I have been running continuous network copies of a 400MB file for about 
8 hours and experienced no problems.
As a side note: the idle CPU temperature reported by ACPI on my Shuttle 
iDeq200N barebone has gone from approx. 50 degrees down to approx. 43 
degrees.
