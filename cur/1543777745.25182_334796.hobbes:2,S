Subject: [ANNOUNCE][RFC] PlugSched-5.2.3 for 2.6.12 and 2.6.13-rc3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This version contains minor bug fixes and improvements to spa_no_frills 
and zaphod schedulers including changes to the default configuration 
parameters for zaphod that take into account the results of tests using 
Con Kolivas's new (and very useful) interbench benchmark tool.
A patch from Plugsched-5.2.2 to PlugSched-5.2.3 for 2.6.12 is available at:
<
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cpuse/plugsched-5.2.2-to-5.2.3-for-2.6.12.patch?download>
and a full patch for 2.6.13-rc3 is available at:

Very Brief Documentation:
You can select a default scheduler at kernel build time.  If you wish to
boot with a scheduler other than the default it can be selected at boot
time by adding:
cpusched=<scheduler>
to the boot command line where <scheduler> is one of: ingosched,
nicksched, staircase, spa_no_frills or zaphod.  If you don't change the
default when you build the kernel the default scheduler will be
ingosched (which is the normal scheduler).
The scheduler in force on a running system can be determined by the
contents of:
/proc/scheduler
Control parameters for the scheduler can be read/set via files in:
/sys/cpusched/<scheduler>/
