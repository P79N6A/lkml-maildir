The following error message appeared on the active vconsole during idle
time last night:
kernel BUG at /var/linux-dev/linux/include/linux/pagemap.h:102!
The --MARK-- messages to syslog continued and logins worked but neither
ppp or shutdown ran to completion after this  message, it required a cold
boot from the reset button to recover.
