> You can see that I run ide-scsi, an md device (RAID0) and the locations of the drives. Now I can *write* a CD just fine, but when I close or "fixate" the disc I get IRQ timeouts. Here is a sample from trying to "fixate" using cdrecord:

This CD was successfully "closed" in Win98, I was also able to write one all the way through using Windoze. So I know this hardware works, and is capable of doing this...
