The maximum per process is 3GB, but the virtual address space is
necessarily split into different areas.  The problem here is that glibc
allocates small kmalloc requests from a "heap" which grows contiguously,
and when that section of virtual memory hits another one (the mmap()
area), it cannot grow any larger.
Ideally glibc should then be able to mmap() itself another chunk of
anonymous memory and continue servicing small mallocs from that, but in
its current implementation glibc will only use this mechanism for large
malloc requests.
