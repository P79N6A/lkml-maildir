   I have same problem since 2.3.40. I have tracked it to a problem with "lo"
   interface. It seems that after successfull authentication, login tries to
   access 127.0.0.1 on port 111. The kernel responds with "port unreachable"
   but for some reason login does not see it. Too bad I don't have time to
   investigate the problem :-(
   tcpdump output, kernel config, and other info are available on request.
Please, tcpdump would be useful.  And it would be excellant if you
could get an 'strace' log of the process which gets stuck.  I bet
it is calling getpeername() or similar to check the connected'ness
of the socket and we're doing the wrong thing.
Later,
