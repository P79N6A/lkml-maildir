This change seems rather unlikely for 2.6.24 at this point (high risk),
but could be good for 2.6.25.
One thing it should probably have for the early going,
is a simple way to turn it on/off at boot time,
so that we don't have people "stuck" unable to run
the test kernels should something weird happen.
Alan / David / Ingo,
What do you think of the idea of a *temporary* boot flag for this,
something like port80=on/off (pick a suitable name) ?
Cheers
