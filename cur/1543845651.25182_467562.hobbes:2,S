Hi!
After a very long session of searching for the reason for error messages like 
Unpacking initramfs...<0>Kernel panic - not syncing: bad gzip magic numbers
Unpacking initramfs...<0>Kernel panic - not syncing: no cpio magic
i luckily was able to determine the malefactor. There was the initrd support 
built into the kernel while the ramdisk driver was just built as a module.
Is it senseful to have the possibility to built the Initramfs/Initrd-support 
without having the ramdisk driver forced to be integrated also?
King regards from Germany
