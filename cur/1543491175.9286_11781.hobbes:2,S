   Someone talked about a 16 colour VGA fbcon. Where does this live ?
It's mine (and Petr Vandrovec's).  You can find a patch against 2.2.3
(presumably 2.2.4 also) on my machine at
	
ftp://pfaffben.user.msu.edu/misc/vga16-6.patch
I'm currently using it to build a set of graphical GUI-based
installation disks for Debian.  Ever seen a single-floppy Linux
GUI-based install?  You will, and with luck it will be in the next
Debian release.
Comments and suggestions are more than welcome, of course.
