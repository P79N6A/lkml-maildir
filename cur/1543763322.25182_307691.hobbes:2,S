Ok, I see you have an ALPS touchpad. I think this patch will help you
with swsusp:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111212532524998&q=raw
Also, could you please try sticking psmouse_reset(psmouse) call at the
beginning of drivers/input/mouse/alps.c::alps_reconnect() and see if
it can suspend _without_ the patch above.
Thanks!
