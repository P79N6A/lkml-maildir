That argument might work if there was an economic stake involved.
For the *volunteers* who have developed Linux over the years there is
not. I'm sure they like their users to be happy, but they'd rather have
the best technical solution instead of happy users I suspect. Especially
if the user doesn't contribute to the development themself.

I'll be you a cookie that BeOS and MS's OSes and every OS has *some*
way to fry your hard drive if you have "root" access to the box.
