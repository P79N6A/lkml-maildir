Yes and no. Yes because there is no config option for that (may be useful
on embedded systems), no because there is general consensus that this is
not a bug. :-)

It works for the "bug fix" vs. "new feature" question, which seems to be
the reason for this thread.

Feature freezes actually are pointless for that reason. The only thing to
check when adding new features is whether they really have no effect on
the generated code when turned off.

Well, I would expect that code that is supposed to be stable (not marked
as "EXPERIMENTAL") doesn't change except when bugs are removed, so that at
the end of the feature freeze the end user can expect that these drivers
have reached a certain level of stability. IMO the "Ask for
experimental/incomplete drivers" switch is there for exactly this reason
(feature freezing incomplete drivers is senseless).

APIs should change (if at all) when all the features that were delayed by
a feature freeze are added into the next version. A feature freeze is no
reason not to add a new filesystem, provided it stays in its own
subdirectory and is marked as EXPERIMENTAL.
