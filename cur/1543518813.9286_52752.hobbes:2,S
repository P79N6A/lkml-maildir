Obviously a bug somewhere but ... (someone correct me if I'm wrong)
there isn't really much point in modular initrd SCSI for a custom
kernel compile.  AFAIK that mkinitrd machinery is mostly there just to
support Red Hat's installation method.
So compile SCSI, sd (SCSI disk) and your particular SCSI card into the
kernel directly, forget ramdisk, forget initrd, and play ball.  Added
bonus, your system will run marginally more efficiently (though in
practice the difference will most likely be too small to notice).

Dunno.
