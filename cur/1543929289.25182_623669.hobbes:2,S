Dear All,
The Linux Test Project test suite has been released for the month of
NOVEMBER 2007. The latest version of the test-suite contains 3000+
tests for the Linux OS and can be found at 
http://ltp.sourceforge.net/.
Latest happenings in LTP can also be found at:
http://ltp.sourceforge.net/wiki/,
http://ltp.sourceforge.net/wikiArchives.php,
 and,
IRC: irc.freenode.org #ltp.
Our web site also contains other information such as:
- A Linux test tools matrix
- Technical papers
- How To's on Linux testing
- Code coverage analysis tool.
Release Highlights:
* Several Network Test Cases has been updated to be run on different
subnet configuration,
* Updated lot of Test Cases to enable them run on NFS,
* Addition of posix_fadvise, fadvise64, madvise03, sendfile64 &
sendfile04 Test Cases to LTP
* Existing code in LTP-Kdump has been enhanced to test dump on Network
and different partitions, added IA64 support to KDUMP and lots of
changes in KDUMP scripts for error correction and improvement,
* Option to generate more parsible output in HTML format has been added,
* Option to automatically mail back LTP reports has been added,
* OpenHPI 2.10.1 has been integrated to LTP,
* Updated several Test Cases for suiting to proper GPLv2 License,
Note(s) from the Maintainer:
LTP has seen heightened activity in the month of Nov 2007. Thanks for
your efforts and contributions. Steps taken to improve LTP
infrastructure in various dimensions has seen efforts becoming fruitful.
We have added HTML output and auto-mail back option this month. We will
continue to work on XML output in coming days and also evaluate and
finally integrate auto build of kernel and test to LTP in future. New
test cases will continue to get added from community and soon we will
start to investigate all existing test cases for their overall
effectiveness in functionality testing. Your support to improve LTP is
extremely essential and i am expecting more support from you on this.
We would encourage the community to post results to
ltp-results@lists.sf.net,
patches, new tests, bugs or comments/questions to ltp-list@lists.sf.net,

dumping.
-Result analysis has been implemented for filtering as well as link delay.
But the analysis part can be enahnced further
-'setup' file has been modified
      * To accept inputs from user or file
      * To automate configuration of bootloader file to reserve memory for
crashkernel
      * To test basic or exchausted list of LKDTM test
      * To accept user inputs for dumping on different partitions and for
network dumping
-'master' file has been modified
      *To invoke result analysis code of dumping in different destinations
      *to remove cronjob when execution is done, this is a bug fix
-'test' file has been modifed
      *To set kdump.conf file based on user input and trigger crash
-'Makefile' has been modified not to run 'setup'
-Added new files
      *kdump_propogate ->To add ssh public keys to network dump server
      *verify_dump ->To verify dump in different partitions and network
dumping
      *lkdtm.orig is replaced with lkdtm.base for basic testcases of lkdtm,
lkdtm.exha for exhausted list of lkdtm testcases.
