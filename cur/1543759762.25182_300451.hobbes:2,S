Subject: NFS problem in 2.4.21 (RHEL ES 3 upd 2)

I've just built a cluster of dual Opteron boxes, running RHEL 3 update 2
x86_64 OS.
I have problems creating files larger than 2GB on an NFS mounted filesystem.
Creating files larger than this on local filesystems is no problem.
Filesystems are all ext3.  Coreutils is version 4.5.3-26.
I can't find any "largefile" flags, etc in nfs, nfsd, rpc.nfsd, rpc.mountd,
exports or exportfs man pages.
Any pointers to other docs, etc. greatly appreciated.
thanks,
-chuck
