May be it could be usefull to do something generic that call driver
get_mctrl instead of doing it in the driver (like it is done in
bfin_5xx, sa1100, ...)

Or to say "recheck get_mctrl before my start_tx).
But have you got an idea how the driver could ask that to the serial core ?
flags in struct uart_port seems full.
