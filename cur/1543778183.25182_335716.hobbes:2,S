I'm not exactly impressed with their implementation, it's completely silly 
that there is no such convience function based on jiffies, e.g. if you 
look at the msleep_interruptible(), you'll find quite a few 
"msleep_interruptible(jiffies_to_msecs())".
msleep_interruptible() is especially bad as there are a few users who 
check the return value and since it adds one to the timeout, you can 
create loops which may never timeout (as e.g. in drivers/w1/w1_therm.c: 
w1_therm_read_bin()), this is nice example of a bad interface.
These two function should actually look like this:
static inline void msleep(unsigned int msecs)
{
	sleep(msecs_to_jiffies(msecs));
}
static inline int msleep_interruptible(unsigned int msecs)
{   
	sleep_interruptible(msecs_to_jiffies(msecs)) != 0;
}

There is _no_ difference, the scheduler is based on ticks. Even if we soon 
have different time sources, the scheduler will continue to measure the 
time in ticks and for a simple reason - portability. Jiffies _are_ simple, 
don't throw that away.
