Subject: [PATCH][MMC] Power cycle (round 2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I didn't get any response from you the last time I submitted this so I'm
going to nag you some more ;)
This patch is vital for one of my MMC cards. The only other way I've
found to get it working is by changing the OCR. And that would cause
problems on other controllers so it was not an option.
The patch is rather well tested with over 500 downloads and no reported
problems. Just to keep everyone happy the default is still 'no' for
Kconfig but I personally would think a 'yes' would be better.
Rgds
