I was trying to point out a flaw in Ted's logic.  He said "we've recently
discoverd these hashs are weak because we found collsions.  Current
/dev/random doesn't care about this."
I certainly wasn't saying padding was a requirment.  But I was trying to
point out that the SHA-1 implementaion crrently in /dev/random by design is
collision vulnerable.  Collision resistance isn't a requirment for it's
purposes obviously.
Guess my pointing this out is a lost cause.
