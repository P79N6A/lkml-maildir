^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Currently the kobject implementation is pure and well-defined.  It is
a good implementation [kobject], and I'd hate to see it lost into being
convoluted with/into another model.
Currently the infrastructure layers are well defined:
   kobject ->  (A layer with objects, their behavor and implementation)
          device ->   (--"--)
                  sysfs.   (--"--)
This isn't that bad of an infrastructure.
It is this well defined layering, i.e. objects, their behavior and
implementation, that allows different (better/worse) infrastructures
to be built on top of it.
It is this well-defined layering which will allow what Tejun wants
to be implemented.
