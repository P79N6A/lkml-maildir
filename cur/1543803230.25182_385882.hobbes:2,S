Okay, I had a chance to go back and look into this deeper when applied
on top of Lucho's new mux code.  It appears (to Lucho and I) that the
the v9fs_mux_rpc() code zero's out *rcall really early on, so I don't
see where this could lead to a double kfree.  If you still think we
are missing something, let me know and I'll have another look.

I went looking for an example of how to do this better.  More or less,
v9fs reads and writes are similar to DirectIO since they don't go
through the page-cache.  So, I looked at what NFS does when it gets a
DirectIO write, and it looks (to me) like it does more or less the
same thing:
(from nfs_file_direct_write() in fs/nfs/direct.c)
        retval = nfs_direct_write(inode, ctx, &iov, pos, 1);
        if (mapping->nrpages)
                invalidate_inode_pages2(mapping);
Now, that being said, it still seems to me to be a bit heavy weight --
do folks have a better pointer to code that I can use as an example of
how to do this more efficiently?
