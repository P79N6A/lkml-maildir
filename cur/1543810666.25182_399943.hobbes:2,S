Oh, and while we're at it: perhaps someone should revert the patch that
caused Douglas Gilbert to chase incompatible sysfs changes in his
user-space applications. It's pretty sad to see random breakage,
apparently by randomly changing / to : in paths from what I discern from
Doug's Changelog. (No, I don't have the background handy, neither would
I care; I just see the application chasing sysfs changes, and that's
enough to complain.)
