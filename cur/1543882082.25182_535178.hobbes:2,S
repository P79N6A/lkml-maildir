I missed the part where you showed that it was a better solution than
the alternatives.

I don't understand what you mean at all. A block has always been a
contiguous area of disk.

I actually don't like it too much because it can't provide a robust
solution. What do you do on systems with small memories, or those that
eventually do get fragmented?
Actually, I don't know why people are so excited about being able to
use higher order allocations (I would rather be more excited about
never having to use them). But for those few places that really need
it, I'd rather see them use a virtually mapped kernel with proper
defragmentation rather than putting hacks all through the core code.

Is that a big problem? Really? You use 16K pages on your IPF systems,
don't you?

I don't think that it is solved, and I think the heuristics that are
there would be put under more stress if they become widely used. And
it isn't only about whether we can get the page or not, but also about
the cost. Look up Linus's arguments about page colouring, which are
similar and  I also think are pretty valid.
