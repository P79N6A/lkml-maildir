I definately agree.  Actually resetting the hardware so that odd responses would
never be received would be a much better solution.  However, when this problem
(and the above corresponding workaround to fix it) was first proposed almost a
year ago:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0606.2/3055.html
It was met with no action.  I understand that actually doing a reset of the
hardware is a much better solution, but I'm certainly not knoweldgeable enough,
nor do I have the documentation needed to implement that solution.  Until it is,
this patch lets kexec work properly on this hardware, which I think is a good
trade until such time as the proper fix is implemented.
Thanks & Regards
Neil
