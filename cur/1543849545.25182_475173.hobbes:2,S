But, it also violates the assumptions of the network devices.
It calls NAPI poll back with IRQ's disabled and potentially doesn't
obey the semantics about only running on the same CPU as the
received packet.

So we can try once and if that fails we have to defer to tasklet.
We can't call NAPI, we can't try and cleanup the device will need
an IRQ to get unblocked.  
Or add another device callback that just to handle that case.
