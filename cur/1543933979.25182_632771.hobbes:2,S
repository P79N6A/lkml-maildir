And if this eats someones disk because you drive the hardware out of spec
you are going to sit there and tell them to bisect it ? Lovely. 
Ingo - put the christmas wine away and have a coffee. Now think first.
You won't bisect obscure timing triggered problems, and the _p users are
almost all for hardware where performance doesn't matter one iota (eg
CMOS).
This isn't even all down to the chipset internal logic - several of my
boxes have external CMOS NVRAM/RTC chips which are probably the same
design (if a little smaller) as ten years ago.
io_delay = none is exactly the same thing as CPU overclocking. Hard to
debug, unpredictable and stupid.
