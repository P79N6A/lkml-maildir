I am sorely tempted to say "bollocks" to that. It may be true in
many cases but I doubt it is provably true in all cases and thus
is the Wrong Thing to impose.
  Consider an ippp link being managed by diald (which, not entirely
coincidentally, I have quite a few around...). The ippp interface
must be configured and up in order for it to accept incoming calls.
But the _routes_ must point through diald's proxy. When diald
decides the link needs to be up it initiates the call and points
the routes through the real interface. The proxy stays up.
  It isn't impossible to make diald work in an environment where
routes magically appear whenever an interface changes in some way.
However that isn't _always_ the right thing to do and it isn't
necessary to do it in kernel space when everyone is already
familiar with the need to set routes from user space after changing
an interface.
