Ah right. But would a CF memory card be cardbus anyway?

My apologies. It was gkrellm leading me up the garden path on that 
one... Copying about 100MB from a 512MB CF card (25+ photos from my 
camera) vmstat 5 reports 4% usercpu, 96% system cpu. And the response on 
the system is sluggish to say the least. (Moving the pointer in X is 
painful :). gkrell meanwhile on it's cpu graph shows about 30% system, 
and the rest as userCPU. No idea why, I guess till I find out I'll just 
regard gkrellm's cpu graph as a waste of space (To differentiate system 
& user cpu anyway :).
