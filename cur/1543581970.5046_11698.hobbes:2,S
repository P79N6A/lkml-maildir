Hi all,
I think that most of us using modems begin to experience a little pain in
downloading latest Alan's patches since they're becoming to be really big (and
interesting).
Since I have an occasionnal access to a system equipped with a good line, I
began to make incremental patches for these kernels. These patches are about
60 kb instead of nearly 2 Mb. Those who are interested can download them from
this url :
   
http://www-miaif.lip6.fr/willy/pub/linux-patches/ac/
Of course, they are not signed nor official, and people who want to use them
for production would better get them from the official sites.
At the moment, only ac9-to-ac10 and ac10-to-ac12 are provided.
To use them :
- extract official linux-2.4.1
- apply one of Alan's patches (acXX)
- apply one of these incremental patches (acXX-acYY)
-> you'll get a 2.4.1-acYY
Hope this will help people to test and report bugs.
Cheers,
Willy
