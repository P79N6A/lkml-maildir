ext3 on raid5 is showing very poor performance with some VM-intensive
workloads.  The reason for this is that page_launder is preventing
scheduling of the `raid5d' thread.
As the inactive_dirty list gets larger and larger, page_launder takes
longer and longer.  The latency between waking and running raid5d gets
longer and longer, so the disk write throughput gets lower and lower,
so the inactive_dirty list gets longer and longer, etc.  It's a
positive feedback loop which leads to collapse.
It is *much* worse on SMP - probably because I haven't found the right
workload to trigger it on UP.  It is much worse with highmem - I think
something's broken with page reclaim and highmem - Marcelo's stats show
it up.
The overall throughput seems to drop to about 1/20th of what it should
be, or worse.  The same could happen with ext2 or any other filesystem.
Here is a histogram of the time it takes between waking and actually
running the raid5d thread when things are gummed up.  For a five second
period:
Milliseconds		   # occurrences
	0   			132
	1   			3
	2   			1
	3   			1
	24  			1
	28  			1
	31  			1
	284 			1
	296 			1
	298 			1
	500 			1
	962 			1
	1161			1
	1297			1
This machine has only 512 megs of RAM.  The effect will presumably
be worse with more memory.
The raid5 code wakes up raid5d from interrupt context, and from inside
locks, so a sched_yield there is not a comfortable or general fix.
Adding a rescheduling point to page_launder fixes the gross congestion
and gets the histogram down to:
0   			529
1   			7
2   			13
3   			59
4   			44
5   			3
6   			3
7   			6
8   			7
9   			10
10  			10
11  			18
12  			11
13  			6
14  			1
15  			3
Which is still pretty bad - across a five-second run there is a lot of
time there not spent submitting IOs.
So flush_dirty_buffers() needs fixing as well and that brings the
raid5d stalls down to a few milliseconds with the tiobench workload.
With one-megabyte writes, raid5d is stalled by 10-20 milliseconds, so
we need to fix generic_file_read() and generic_file_write().
Happily, we've just fixed the four most gross sources of poor
interactivity in the kernel, so let's knock over some of the others as
well - a few /proc functions.  That mainly leaves zap_page_range() and
exit() with a lot of open files.
Neil, I'd be interested if this makes much difference with ext2 on
software RAID - the problem materialises under really heavy write pressure.
tiobench with a file twice the size of physical RAM shows it up.
