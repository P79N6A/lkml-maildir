	I've used multicast with great success in the past and I know
that it's possible to bind a multicast socket on an interface. So,
basically I would bind a multicast socket on the loopback. That what I
was refering to in my e-mail by "UDP broadcast".
	But, it just seems to me inefficient to have to go through all
the way down in the network stack to the loopback interface (through
IP and TCP) just for simple IPC. A multicast unix socket would be much
more efficient (because it would no mess with any headers and support
higher MTU).
