I think we can do that already, using FastCGI.
As I understand it, the traditional CGI server system call flow is:
   accept
   fork
    \ setuid(user)
      exec(cgi script)
And I don't see how your 4 extra system calls would improve that flow.
The FastCGI flow is:
   setuid(user)
   exec(fastcgi script)
   loop receiving requests over a pipe and processing
In this case the handling process has already been forked and exec'ed
so the time-consuming work is done once and the script can then get
on with the business of processing requests as quickly as possible.
I'm sure there are other execution models where the CGI processors
are pre-forked. Executing the CGI script (e.g. through a scripting
language) is presumably the most expensive operation, and doing that
in advance won't be useful if you have large numbers of distinct users
but they won't all be running CGIs all the time. In other words, if you
had 300,000 users and 1 CGI script being run, you won't want to pre-fork
300,000 processes each with a different uid. But if you had 300,000
users and 200,000 different CGI scripts, you also have no choice but
to fork and exec at request time, because there are too many different
scripts.
