Subject: Bug report [linux 2.2.14 and 2.3.3x], /proc/sys/real-root-dev not  big-endian compliant.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/1/24/65

In file /usr/src/linux/kernel/sysctl.c, "/proc/sys/real-root-dev" is defined
as is:
	#ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD
      	  {KERN_REALROOTDEV, "real-root-dev", &real_root_dev, sizeof(int),
         	0644, NULL, &proc_dointvec},
	#endif
real_root_dev is defined as kdev_t type (typedef struct { unsigned short
major, minor; } kdev_t;).
this definition returns a different result on a big-endian and a
little-endian architecture.
This is quite wrong and need to be fixed!
