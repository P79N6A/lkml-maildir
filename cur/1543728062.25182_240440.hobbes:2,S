another idea: you are running this on a C3, using CONFIG_MCYRIXIII,
correct? That is one of the rare configs that triggers X86_USE_3DNOW and
MMX ops. If 3dnow is in any way handicapped in that CPU then that could
cause trouble. Could you compile for e.g. CONFIG_M586TSC? [that option
should be fully compatible with a C3.] - this will exclude the MMX page
clearing ops.
what makes me suspicious is this entry in your call-trace:
>  [<c013e2ee>] do_anonymous_page+0x7e/0x190
this is the next instruction after:
   call   c01d1910 <mmx_clear_page>
but it's all a bit weird - the ALSA interrupt should have hit the
fast_clear_page() function but it didnt. Maybe it doesnt show up because
the call to fast_clear_page() within mmx_clear_page() is tail-optimized
and possibly the stack entry is lost. But still ...
