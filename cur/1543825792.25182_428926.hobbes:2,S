That is wrong. And I have a code and picture to show that, 
and you dont - prove me wrong :)
Attached code and picture which shows _exactly_ the same distribution for
folded and not folded Jenkins hash distribution, and it's artifact
compared to XOR hash.
Fairly distributed values being XORed produce still fairly distributed
value.
