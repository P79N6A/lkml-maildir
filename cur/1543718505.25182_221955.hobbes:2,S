Heh, yeah.  I actually did look, and had the same concern about goal.
I think it's ok though.  For one thing, in that changed->reread loop
goal is never used.  Secondly, I think that the intention was to have
*_find_goal start from 0, not from last goal, since goal is marked as
output, and Mingming's patch reset goal to 0 every pass through.  This
is exactly why I thought it useful to clarify the api.
thanks,
