Hi Linus,
you made valid points, you know your public very well :-)
However, I have an objection on one point below.

That's true at least for me, except that I *try* to test *ALL* versions which
are announced as the most likely future -final. When Marcelo tells us that
-rc2 will be -final if nobody complains, I really test it. I build it on
several archs and try to catch stupid bugs because I hate stupid bugs in
final releases, they pollute bug reports (worst ones being build errors).
However, when he announces -preX (X>1) or when you annonce any -rc which
is not likely to become -final, I just check the changelog, and build it
if I both see something which applies to my setup, and I have nothing else
to do.
When I ask you to turn -rc into -final, it's not just to avoid adding
new bugs (eventhough the most quickly fixed bugs may be the most dangerous),
but it's mainly to add credibility to the call so that many people who would
be hesitant will try it.

Agreed too. That's the same reason I asked Marcelo if he would agree to
merge all the uncertain recent mcast fixes early in 2.4.33-pre1.

Are there really projects managed like this ? I hope I don't use anything
from them !!!

Agreed here too from the developper standpoint. However, your final release
are references for all trees. It's better if the common ancestor between
many trees at least builds and does not propagate one horrible bug discovered
10 minutes after release. The least differences there are in code base between
tree, the most relevant the bug reports are. And yes, I know that there is
-stable for this, but most people don't know about it and will simply build
the 2.6.15 announced on slashdot then be the 100th to complain that 2.6.15
does not build because of this or that. (I hope it will not happen :-))

I consider two rcs as important :
  - the first one, to test bugs in features
  - the last one to increase the signal/noise ration in bug reports.
Then it makes sense to test them both. However, I agree that if only one can
be tested, the first one is most interesting to us.
