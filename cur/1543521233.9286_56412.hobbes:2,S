The nice thing of giving up the sysctl numbers is that it would 
be possible to use some ELF section based scheme for declaring sysctl
variables in nice wrapper macros. You could get a sysctl variable with
a single declaration. This would make them a lot more easy. Would you 
accept a patch for that?
