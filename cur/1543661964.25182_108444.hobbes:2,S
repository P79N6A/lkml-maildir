Compiling with -g slows down compilation and link, mainly because of
the extra debugging data that has to be copied around.  -g
significantly increases disk usage.

With gcc, compiling with -g should have no effect on the kernel.  One
of my occasional tests is to build vmlinux with and without -g, run
both through strip -g and compare the results.  They should be
identical except for the build timestamp.
