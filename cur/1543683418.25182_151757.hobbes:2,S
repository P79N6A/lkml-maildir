This sounds very familiar. As I said, the patch fixes the IO-APIC so IRQ 
polarities and  mode is it is now setup as per ACPI... its obviously doing 
_something_ for you.
However, there is a second problem which I do not yet have a resolution for.
On my board, it manifests itself with PCI addon cards.. I never see any IRQs 
from them because the IO-APIC is configured (as per ACPI) for active high 
IRQs, yet the PCI standard is active low IRQs.
I am fairly certain that the IO-APIC is now configured correctly, and that the 
PCI routing is correct, because Windows XP sets everything up in exactly the 
same way, and everything works fine under it. 
There is something else that is not being done by linux. I'd assumed this was 
an nforce2-specific issue, but your results hint that it may be larger than 
this.
