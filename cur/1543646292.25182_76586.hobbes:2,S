	* please switch to use of alloc_disk()/put_disk()
	* don't bother with disk->part allocation - it's done by add_disk()
	* ditto for freeing it (del_gendisk())
	* dasd_partition_to_kdev_t() - please use ->gdp->{major,first_minor}
	* s/bdevname(d_device->bdev)/d_device->gdp->disk_name/
	* lose ->bdev
Note that we are getting bdev->bd_disk and disk->private pretty soon, so
we'll have very easy way to do your devmap by bdev stuff.
Anther thing: tapeblock.c and friends.

	In ~ 2.5.16 blksize_size[] had been removed.  Tape-related code
in s390 was using it, but that was fairly easy to get rid of.  Now, in
2.5.21 somebody (presumably architecture maintainers) had submitted a
patch that
	* reverted all compile fixes, etc. that had happened in 2.5
	* reintroduced use of (long-dead) blksize_size[]
^#$^%@!
Folks, if you do something like that, at least check the bloody changelog...
