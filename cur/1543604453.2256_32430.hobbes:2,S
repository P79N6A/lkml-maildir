"BSD (GPL compatible)"? Or a more generic "Other GPL compatible"?
For that matter, it's not GPL compatibility that matters here, it's source
availability for debugging purposes; AIUI, even an "old-style BSD" module
shouldn't taint the kernel.
Better still, rather than the licensing details, have the source URL.
Either MODULE_SOURCE_URL("
http://example.com/drivers/linux/scsi.html"
) or
MODULE_BINARY_ONLY, with the latter tainting the kernel since the source
is not *freely* available?
