I've seen this happen on MDK 8.2 and MDK 9.1 with or
without custom kernel from 2.4.19 - 2.4.20 ...
it seemed to me to be VM related (swapper) but I had no 
time to take a closer look at it ...
you will find many voodoo answers on the net, how this
was cured (like disable usb, change hd, etc ...) but I 
guess this is some kind of VM deadlock, which can be 
triggered by any memory consuming task activated before 
swap is enabled ...

maybe this has been fixed in 2.4.21-rc6 ...
Summary of changes from v2.4.21-rc5 to v2.4.21-rc6

  o Fix IO stalls and deadlocks
if not, you could try to activate magic sys-req and 
dump the current kernel state, or even better, attach
the debugger and have a look whats going on ...
