If noapic solves the problem then the driver isn't where the bug is, it's 
in the SMP irq table or ACPI irq routing or PCI interrupt routing, but it 
is *not* the driver.
I will repeat, if "noapic" ever solves a driver bug, then the problem 
wasn't a driver bug in the first place!
/me has been listening to people wrongly accuse drivers of IRQ routing 
bugs for going on three years now, ever since the MP table parsing and 
IO-APIC code was first put into the linux kernel and now tends to be a bit 
testy when people make the mistake of calling an IRQ routing bug a driver 
bug.
