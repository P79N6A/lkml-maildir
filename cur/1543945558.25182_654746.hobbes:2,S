I don't see any reason for not userspace visible things to be listed in
feature-removal-schedule.txt (with module names counted as being 
userspace visible) - they can be removed as soon as the last in-kernel

Resend the patches (with a Cc to linux-kernel) until all of them got 
picked up...

That can't harm.
But realistically, the only way to prevent additional uses is to
