Yeah, a static code coverage analyzer or some sort of code-reducer would
be nice; these are in general pipe dreams but eh.  Also these are
compressed bzip2 tarball sizes, not compiled kernel sizes or source tree
sizes.  I would imagine a 100MB bzip2 would turn into something quite
large; the major issue is the amount of work it takes to maintain
something like that.
I am slowly forming the prediction that monolithic kernels won't survive
(Net/Open/FreeBSD, Linux) and only microkernels or so-called
"nanokernels" (or the exokernel ...) will be maintainable EVENTUALLY;
however I don't have sufficient data, as one would have to illustrate a
maintenance advantage in those models to complete that prediction and I
lack understanding to do such.  Besides, there's no good data on the
upper bound of what is maintainable; it's somewhere below the size of
the universe, that's about all I can give you.
