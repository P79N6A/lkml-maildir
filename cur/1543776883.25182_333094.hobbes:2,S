Don't jump to hasty conclusions.  Problems like this are often caused by
unrelated things that you wouldn't suspect at first.  Getting something to
work once doesn't mean the problem has been fixed.  And you can be fooled
by coincidences.  (I would be surprised if that event above was really 
caused by plugging in the scanner, unless your UHCI hardware is broken.)
One thing you might try, time-consuming though it will be, is to remove or
disable as much hardware as possible from your system.  If you can
reliably determine that the problem occurs only when one particular piece
of hardware is enabled, then you'll know how to proceed.
