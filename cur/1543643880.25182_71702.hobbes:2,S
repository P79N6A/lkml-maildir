So Solaris made a stupid design decision to encourage people to use a
thread per call on these big systems and Linux should make the same
decision for compatibility?
I can see why people want this: they have huge ugly systems that they would
like to port to Linux with as little effort as possible. But it's not
free for the OS either. 
It's interesting to see that as Linux moves into the phone space owned by
Sun, two things are happening. (1)There is pressure to expand Linux to simply
match Solaris properties and (2) the entire technological and business
basis of those huge 100K+ thread racks is beginning to collapse.
