Hi,
it seems one of the synaptics-related patches in 2.6.0-mm1 kills
off the pointer stick on my T40p.  2.6.0 vanilla works just fine
in that department.  Thought you might want to know.
Reverting
	input-08-synaptics-protocol-discovery.patch
	input-07-remove-synaptics-config-option.patch
	synaptics-powerpro-fix.patch
did not seem to help.  I failed to figure out a way to easily revert
	serio-06-synaptics-use-reconnect.patch
	serio-04-synaptics-cleanup.patch
so that I didn't try.
