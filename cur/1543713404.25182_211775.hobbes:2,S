Was any progress made on this problem?
I am seeing the same panic as was originally reported using both kernel
2.4.25 and 2.4.26-rc1, I can easily reproduce it under the same
conditions as Hasso described in the original email. 
With quagga/ospfd running I simply execute
ifconfig eth0 down
ifconfig eth0 up 
in quick succession and a panic follows within 20 seconds. 
The panic does not occur if ospfd is not running, or if i pause for at
least 10 seconds between the two commands. 
Let me know if I can provide any more information that would be helpful
in solving this problem. 
Regards
