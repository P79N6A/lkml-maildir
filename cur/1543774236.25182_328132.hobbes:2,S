I did the tests again on a partition that I could mkfs/mount at will.
On ext3, I get about 33 seconds average latency.
And on ext2, as predicted, I have latencies in average of about 0.4 seconds.
I also tried reiserfs, and it gets about 22 seconds latency.
As you pointed out, it seems that there is a flow in the way IO queues and
journals (that are in some ways queues as well), interact in the presence of
flushes.
