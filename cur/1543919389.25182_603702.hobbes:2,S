Not at the moment, unfortunately.  I suspect that with the recent  
developments in user container support and/or overlay mounting it  
will become possible to either write a UID/GID-translation overlay  
filesystem or grant cross-UID-container keys to achieve what you  
want.  On the other hand that probably won't fully happen for up to a  
year or so.
