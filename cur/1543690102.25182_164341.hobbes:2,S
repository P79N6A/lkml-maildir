I find 2 errors in Mandrake 9.2 rc 1
1. If I do  cd /usr/src/linux; make menuconfig (kernel-source-2.4.22-1mdk
package has been preliminary installed) and go to section Sound->Advanced
Linux Sound Architecture, program terminated with message:
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:
 Q> scripts/Menuconfig: line 832: MCmenu76: command not found
Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also
send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>.
Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
2. If i do cd /usr/src/linux; make xconfig program not started and write to
console:
rm -f include/asm
( cd include ; ln -sf asm-i386 asm)
if [ -f .need_mrproper ]; then \
        rm .need_mrproper; \
        make mrproper;  \
        make preconfig;  \
fi
make -C scripts kconfig.tk
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.22-1mdk/scripts'
cat header.tk >> ./kconfig.tk
./tkparse < ../arch/i386/config.in >> kconfig.tk
3rdparty/lufs/Config.in: 2: can't handle dep_bool/dep_mbool/dep_tristate
condition
make[1]: *** [kconfig.tk] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.22-1mdk/scripts'

Pls, Inform how to correct it and correct it in final release.
Best Regards.
