PLEASE NOTE:
 The DMSDOS project is dead. I no longer maintain it due to lack of time.
 The latest supported kernel is 2.2.15 with dmsdos 0.9.2.1.
 There will never be a kernel 2.4.x port. Dmsdos 0.9.2.3-pre2 was an
 attempt to port the code, but it has failed. Don't use it.

and it is latest dmsdos related file I found (and 0.9.2.1 is latest
I used on 2.2.17), so I believe that it is safe to remove cvf code
from fatfs. Both Stacker and Doublespace supported FAT16 only, so
current usual 120GB disk would require 120 logical units with estimated
compression ratio 2:1. IMHO adding dmsdosfs into mtools is the best 
solution for those who still need it.
                                            Best regards,
                                                    Petr Vandrovec
