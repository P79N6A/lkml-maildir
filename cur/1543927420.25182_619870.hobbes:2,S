Hi Andrew,
The kernel build fails, in selinux with following error
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  UPD     include/linux/compile.h
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
security/built-in.o(.toc1+0x928): undefined reference to `selinux_xfrm_refcount'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
11/20/2007-14:42:08 Build the kernel. Failed rc = 2
11/20/2007-14:42:08 build: Building kernel... Failed rc = 1
The patch causing this error is git-lblnet.patch, where in the selinux_xfrm_enabled()
is called from security/selinux/hooks.c, depends on the extern atomic_tselinux_xfrm_refcount.
