I don't see why it would have to be slow. Mapping the memory
with coherency disabled will reduce bus traffic for all the
regular kernel code doing non-DMA stuff. (coherency requires
that the CPU generate address-only bus operations)
The obvious concern is that some kernel code might touch
a cache line after the invalidate but before the DMA is
done. If that could be considered a bug, then every non-SMP
Mac could gain some speed by turning off coherency.
Maybe the x86 MTRRs allow for something similar.
For device --> memory DMA:
1. write back cache lines that cross unaligned boundries
2. start the DMA
3. invalidate the above cache lines
4. invalidate cache lines that are fully inside the DMA
For memory --> device DMA:
1. write back all cache lines affected by the DMA
2. start the DMA
3. invalidate the above cache lines
