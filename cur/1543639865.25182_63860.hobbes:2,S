Yes, we need to get it up and running for 2.5.  It should be relatively
straightforward.  It'll need an ext3_get_blocks_for_o_direct() which
does a journal_start/stop if create=1.
And maybe some fancy footwork around invalidating existing pagecache in
ext3_file_write(), but the current code looks to be OK actually.
It shouldn't be a big deal; mainly testing.
