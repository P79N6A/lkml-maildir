Because you can't build a 1k fs on a 2k blockdevice.

Because raid always uses a PAGE_SIZE blocksize and by design linux doesn't
support blockdevices with blocksizes > PAGE_SIZE.

Of course we need to clean up this to extend the kdev_t or we'll have a
too big array but the logic must remains. If you don't know the
hardblocksize you don't know if the blocksize of the fs that you are
mounting is too big for your underying blockdevice.

You can't emulate a 512kbyte softblocksize with a 2k hardblocksize.
About the patch the #defines are faster during compile and we may need 
NR_REQUESTS from the outside. The compiler can't generate better code with
an inline if something it's the opposite if the compiler is lazy.

What DaveM did is been to grab hardware, stress it in different ways
logging all the hash insert/remove he generated on the buffer cache. Then
he took the log and made an hashfn that was distributing the buffer heads
in the best possible way for his empirical input.
