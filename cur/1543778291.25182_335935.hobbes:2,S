That will work around it but I think we should fix it.  Changing to
strncmp() fixes most cases.
-       if (strcmp(name, dev->bus_id) == 0)
+       if (strncmp(name, dev->bus_id, strlen(dev->bus_id)) == 0)
I work in this area and I couldn't figure out why it was silently not
working. I had to add the printk to the source before I could figure
it out. I suspect most people are going to have this trouble.
This has also made me realize that I have created other places in the
kernel where my sysfs attribute code is not going to work correctly.
Maybe we should adjust the sysfs driver to strip leading and trailing
white space before passing the string on.
