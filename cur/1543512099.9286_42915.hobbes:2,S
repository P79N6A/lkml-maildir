Hmm... I'm not sure that allowing i_size to change in the middle of
writepage() is a good idea. I'll look at it. i_realsize is the size of
initialized part of file... Maybe it can be merged with i_size, but I'll
have to look at mm/filemap.c to be sure.

On what? ITYM truncate(), right? Metadata doesn't end up in the page
cache, so... ->flushpage() set to block_flushpage() should be OK, but it
will not be enough. All stuff with truncate()/write() is racey right now,
AFAICS. The next thing I'm going to do is a (dumb) implementation of
blocking rwlocks. write() being reader and truncate() - writer. 
Oh, crap! Add
