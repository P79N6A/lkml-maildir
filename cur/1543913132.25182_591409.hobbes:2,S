That kind of stinks - and seems to be a potential duplication of effort all

Then this makes perfect sense to actually have it in the proper places, and 
have it go through the standard review process. I have run into problems 
recently, where ugly hackish tests seem never really catch actual faults. 
(Since they were written by the same person who wrote the driver - Design a 
fault in, code the fault, test the fault is there).
With many eyes - and all that stuff - hopefully we would catch things.

Putting them close to the standard directories might be OK - keeping the tests 
close to the thing that is being tested may help with maintainers keeping an 
eye on things that might be missed otherwise.
Maybe these types of tests should go into a separate directory - power on self 
tests (post) directories in the respective places? ./kernel/post 
and ./drivers/xxxx/post?
So Mike's proposed string tests would go into ./lib/post/strings.c
When things pass - you get a single indication (all tests for unit X passed) 
or a pass for each test?
