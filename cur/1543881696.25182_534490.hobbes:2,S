Why noexec?  Either it was a silly or arbitrary decision, or
our kernel design may be incomplete.
Now I can see not wanting to support executables if you are locking
down a system.  The classic don't execute a program from a CD just because
the CD was stuck in the drive problem.
So I can see how executing code from an untrusted source could prevent
exploitation of other problems, and we certainly don't want to do it
automatically.
