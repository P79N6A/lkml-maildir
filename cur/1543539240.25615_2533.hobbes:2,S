Aside from the obvious problems with MAC addresses... this is not very
difficult to do.  There would have to be an interface for flash starting
a socket -- the application would have to provide a _complete_ description
of the socket as there will be no standard opening sync up.  I know this can
be done as I did it many years ago as a joke (back in the 0.99pl15j era.  I
did it to prove how easy it is to steal a connection -- I was assuming a
telnet connection from my Mac.  Ah, those were the days...)
