I don't have one handy to quote from, but personally I find there
are two problems with what's currently presented.
1 - information overload. It's just a screenfull of numbers.
2 - the column headings were non-obvious iirc. Or maybe I'm just dumb
    and didn't look at them long enough.
So it could just need some formatting tweaks to make it more
palatable.
