Hummm... uvesafb _shouldn't_ be x86 specific. At least according to 
their page [1] where it says: "works on non-x86 systems".
Uvesafb uses a x86 emulator in userspace to run code from the video card 
ROM, so it should work on any PCI system where we can access the video 
card ROM and can emulate the hardware used by the ROM code.
Why do you say that it's x86 specific? Am I missing something?
