Unfortunately there are many reasons to keep me away from sending a
patch.
- it is large (48 source files).
- it supports linux-2.6.16 and later, and uses
	#if ... LINUX_VERSION_CODE ...
  condition a lot. I want to keep handling them as long as possible
  since some users use it.
- there are sereral codes I want to rewrite cleanly or well-behaved.
- and other reasons.
But if you really want to read or try it, you can get all source files
from sourceforge. Read 
http://aufs.sf.net
 and try,
$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@aufs.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/aufs login
(CVS password is empty)
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@aufs.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/aufs co aufs
