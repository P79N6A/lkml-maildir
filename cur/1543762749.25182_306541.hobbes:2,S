Hi folks,
given that the alsa-user-mailinglist has some strange kind of authentication
mechanism, and admin-authorization and whatever, I'm writing this mail to the
LKML (it would have been CCed here anyway).
The current snd-powermac module from ALSA seems to have trouble with modern
Apple iBook computers (and possible other Apple notebooks, but I can't tell
for sure). With 2.6.11.5 and having snd-powermac loaded, playing some sound
results in a very noisy playback; you can only hear that if you turn volume
on the PCM and VOL mixers up to the maximum, and even then, it's very hard 
to hear. After removing snd-powermac and loading the "old" pmac-driver, the
sound playback works just fine.
I have been able to find out that with 2.6.8 (at least with the version that
Debian ships currently), the problem does not appear; snd-powermac does its
job very nicely there. Given that 2.6.11 included some ALSA changes, I just
compiled 2.6.10 on this box and booted it, and had the same problems I have
with snd-powermac on 2.6.11.5.
Is this a known problem and is a fix available for it? If not, what can I do
to help with hunting this bug? I really like ALSA and prefer it over the old
pmac-sound-driver.
