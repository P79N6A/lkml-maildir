Sorry, I explained it badly.
The negative timer values were converted to MAX_JIFFIES_PER_LONG
timeouts and intervals.
The hrtimer code expects canonical values for the start time and the
interval. The random non canonical values should not do any damage, but
the normalizing routines might loop for a while. The negative start time
will be treated as expired and negative intervals are adjusted to
resolution (jiffie) in the hrtimer_forward code.
So the behaviour is different anyway, but I prefer the clear -EINVAL to
randomness.
