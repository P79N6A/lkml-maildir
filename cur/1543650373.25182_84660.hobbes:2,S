Well, that's kind of hard... which revision history?  They were
added at some point during 2.1, before anyone but sparc64 supported
flush_dcache_page, and certainly long before cachetlb.txt was written.
Arguably, cachetlb.txt is the buggy one since it coopted this interface
without reference to the current users.
PA-RISC doesn't use a.out in any way, shape or form, so it doesn't
matter to me, but m68k might like it fixed, i guess.  Why the calls are
there seems fairly straightforward -- we're effectively doing a read()
of the text segment into the process' address space, and we're about to
execute it.
So flush_icache_user_range() seems like the right thing to do there.
Except that cachetlb says it can't cross a page boundary.  Maybe the
right thing to do is to change the definition of flush_icache_range in
cachetlb to indicate that the addresses are user, not kernel, addresses;
remove the flush_icache_range() in kernel/module.c and put a #error into
every arch's module_arch_init() warning them they may need to flush the
range mod to mod->size.
