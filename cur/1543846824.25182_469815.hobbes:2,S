That all seems to work OK with the two features configged off.
With CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=y, CONFIG_NO_HZ=n it's pretty sick.  It pauses
for several seconds after "input: AlpsPS/2 ALPS GlidePoint as
/class/input/input2" (printk-time claims 2 seconds, but it was longer than
that).
It's been stuck for a minute or more at the 12.980000 time, seems to have
hung.  The cursor is flashing extremely slowly.
