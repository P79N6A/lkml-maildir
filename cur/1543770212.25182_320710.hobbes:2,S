Subject: maximum of 256 loop devices - not enough for cdrom server

Hello !
I want to build a cd-rom server and want to use the loop-driver (loop.c) for that.
That server will be HUGE and I will need to loopback mount more than 256 .iso images in the near future.
Unfortunately, the loop driver doesn`t support >256 device nodes.
Is there a possible solution for this "problem" ?
regards
roland
