Lots of work needs doing. The entire quota code needs rewriting and that won't
happen until 2.5. The reiser+nfs stuff is probably also 2.5

Not interested. Now is stabilizing time, not stuffing crap into the kernel tree
time. Vendors can (and will) ship stuff which is workable but not clean, and
they will hopefully over time fix up the stuff they care about and submit it.
