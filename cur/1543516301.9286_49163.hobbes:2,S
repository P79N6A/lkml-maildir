Web traffic is very large numbers of slow operations. Your ration of 
busy/queued is low. I'd agree there should be a point where you have a lot of
busy operations but web/ftp isnt it.
On a T1 you can expect to see 600 parallel connections. Each is averaging
2 or 3 K a second with a typical 1500 byte MTU. So each FD wakes one or two
times a second. 
So we have 1200 wakeup events per second over 600 handles. Even at 100polls/sec
that means we get 12 positive handles and 588 overheads per poll. As it rises
to the real world values its hits 1 and 599 overhead at 1000 polls/sec
