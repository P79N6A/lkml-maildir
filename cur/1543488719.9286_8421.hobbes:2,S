This normally means that another name-server says it is "authoritive" for
the domain so your name-server has removed references to this name from
its cache. It is not a TCP error (named/bind uses UDP). If the name
that has been removed, can't be resolved, find that M$GARBAGE machine
that claims that it is authoritive and shoot it. Otherwise ignore it.
The "final solution" is to have only one machine that claims it's
authoritive and the others should be caching-only servers.
Cheers,
