Well, the bus in the generic device model is just a struct device as well.
The parisc implementation I'm working on stores this type of conversion 
information in the platform_data field of the generic device (although the 
function pointers that make use of it are global).
I did do an implementation which added a dma_accessors set of functions to the 
struct device (and also struct bus_type), but I eventually concluded they had 
to be so platform specific that there was no utility to exposing them.

actually, in parisc, the implementation is simple.  The type of memory is 
determined globally per architecture (so it's not encoded in the dma_addr_t).  
As Adam said.  The preferred platform implementation for a machine that did 
both (I believe this is the fabled parisc V class, which I've never seen) 
would be to implement a consistent region so you could tell if dma_addr_t fell 
in that region for whether it was consistent or not.
I fully recognise that dma_addr_t actually has to be freely convertable to the 
physical address by simple casting, because that's the way the pci_ functions 
use it.
