It does have that problem. If a system is in use then memory is fragmented
and requests to the devices are in 4k sizes. The kernel has to manage the 
4k size. The number of requests that the driver can take is limited. 
Larger blocks allow shuffling more data to the device.

Ummm.. Dont get me to comment on i386. I never said that memory fragments 
faster on i386. i386 has multiple issues with memory management that 
require a lot of work and that will cause difficulty. If you have these
fun systems with 512k ZONE_NORMAL and 63GB HIGHMEM then good luck...

Huh? Splitting the blocks requires hardware effort -> Reduction in 
transfer rate.

Oh we have scores of these hacks around. Look at the dvd/cd layer. The 
point is to get rid of those.

But that is due to the VM (at least Linus tree) having no defrag methods.
mm has Mel's antifrag methods and can do it.

But they could be treated as such. Right now these poor guys have to 
improvise around the page size limit.

Less meta data to manage does not reduce fsck times? Going from order 0 to 
order 2 blocks cuts the metadata to a fourth.

Yes you get lots of small request *because* we do not support defrag and 
cannot large contiguous allocations.

Ummm the other arches read 16k blocks of contigous memory. That is not 
supported on 4k platforms right now. I guess you you move those to vmalloc 
areas? Want to hack the filesystems for this?

There are multiple scaling issues in the kernel. What you propose is to 
add hack over hack into the VM to avoid having to deal with 
defragmentation. That in turn will cause churn with hardware etc etc.
