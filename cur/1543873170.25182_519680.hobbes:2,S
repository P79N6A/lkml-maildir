Well, I have cleaned it a little bit, there were more comments and ifdefs
than code ! I've appended it to the end of this mail.
I have changed it a bit, because I noticed that integer divide precision
was so coarse that there were other possibilities to play with the bits.
I have experimented with combinations of several methods :
  - replace integer divides with multiplies/shifts where possible.
  - compensation for divide imprecisions by adding/removing small
    values bofore/after them. Often, the integer result of 1/(x*(x-1))
    is closer to (float)1/(float)x^2 than 1/(x*x). This is because
    the divide always truncates the result.
  - use direct result lookup for small values. Small inputs give small
    outputs which have very few moving bits. Many different values fit
    in a 32bit integer, so we use a shift offset to lookup the value.
    I used this in an fls function I wrote a while ago, that I should
    also post because it is up to twice as fast as the kernel's.
    Sometimes it seems faster to lookup in from memory, sometimes it
    is faster from an immediate value. Maybe more visible differences
    would show up on RISC CPUs where loading 32 bits immediate needs
    two instructions. I don't know yet, I've not tested on my sparc
    yet.
  - use small lookup tables (64 bytes) with 6 bits inputs and at least
    as many on output. We only lookup the 6 MSB and return the 2-3 MSB
    of the result.
  - iterative search and manual refinment of the lookup tables for best
    accuracy. The avg error rate can easily be halved this way.
I have duplicated tried several functions with 0, 1, 2 and 3 divides.
Several of them offer better accuracy over what we currently have, in
less cycles. Others offer faster results (up to 5 times) with slightly
less accuracy.
There is one function which is not to be used, but is just here for
comparison (ncubic_0div). It does no divide but has awful avg error.
But one which is interesting is the ncubic_tab0. It does not use any
divide at all, even not any div64. It shows a 0.6% avg error, which I'm
not sure is enough or not. It is 6.7 times faster than initial ncubic()
with less accuracy, and 4 times smaller. I suspect that it can differ
more on architectures which have no divide instruction.
Is 0.6% avg error rate is too much, ncubic_tab1() uses one single div64
and is twice slower (still nearly 3 times faster than ncubic). It show
0.195% avg error, which is better than initial ncubic. I think that it
is a good tradeoff.
If best accuracy is an absolute requirement, then I have a variation of
ncubic (ncubic_3div) which does 0.17% in 2/3 of the time (compared to
0.247%), and which is slightly smaller.
I have also added a "size" column, indicating approximative function
size, provided that the compiler does not reorder the code. On gcc 3.4,
it's OK, but 4.1 returns garbage. That does not matter, it's just a
rough estimate anyway.
Here are the results classed by speed :

And here comes the code. I have tried to document it a bit, as much
as can be done on experimentation code. It is often easier to use
a pencil and paper to understand how the bits move.
