Hi Andrea
Two little details:
The following line does not print what you expect on
alpha's:
MHZ = int(re.search(r' (\d+)\.?\d?',
                    os.popen("grep -i mhz /proc/cpuinfo | head -n
1").read()).group(1))
My /proc/cpuinfo:

cpu model               : EV56

L3 cache                : 2048K, 1-way, 64b line
Second, you should mention somewhere that it needs at minimum twisted
1.3.0 to work correctly, did you?
Oh, another point:
Some of my machines have long uptimes, and I won't it reboot
to just match the klive runtime. So the reported uptime
is (in my cases) far away from true.
It is very interesting to see how often a vanilla/-git/-mm etc kernel is
tested. Perhaps klive could be extended to automatically report oopses
and/or other troubles if possible. What abut reporting core features
which are used on the machine like fs, scheduler, raid, lvm etc, so that
the devs can see which subsystem got a lot testing and what is not used
much?
Thanks
Marc
