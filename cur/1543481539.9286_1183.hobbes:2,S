Currently SOS (silicon on saphire) runs up to 30 GHz. With current-seeking
logic, where voltages are not changing, therefore capacity is not
a controlling factor in establishing speed, prototype CPU cells are
already being tested.
Given that typical application software requires multiple CPU operations
for every RAM access, a balance will occur when the CPU operations
just fit between the RAM access.

This is double-speak. CPUs execute instructions sequentially, which they
presently get from RAM. Logic requires that this instruction sequence
is not necessarily sequential in RAM (hense caching).
Data are not necessarily accessed sequentially. Long buffers are not the
most common RAM access. The most common access are register-size variables
scattered all over the place. It is harder to keep this in a cache.
Therefore RAM access-time is the domanent pole in the transfer-function
unless you are running tinny spinning-loop benchmarks which mean nothing.

You may disagree. However, from what I've seen in the Labs, there is
a concerted effort to re-balance CPU vs RAM speeds. One of our divisions
is Sky Computer, makes array-processors with "Sky High" performance.
These are mostly sold to the Armed Services, however since the technology
now exists to make real fast stuff, and the yields are getting good, it
will not be long before you get at least the RAM you need.

If you get RAM that runs at twice cache-speed you won't need a cache
(there will probably always be an instruction cache so branch prediction
works).
