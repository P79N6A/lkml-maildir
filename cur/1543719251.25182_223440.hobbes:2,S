For people with old distributions that didn't include irqbalanced yet ;)

the userspace implementation implements a more sophisticated algorithm
for balancing irq's (well to be fair, since its in userspace it's easier
to do this so it's not kirqd's failt that it doesn't have that). 
While I didn't test kirqd to compare, we did see quite a difference
(order of percents) in a specweb load between a naive algorithm in
kirqbalanced and the current algorithm. Otoh few real life workloads get
as many interrupts as specweb ;)
