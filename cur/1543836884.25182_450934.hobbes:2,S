However, 99.99% of all systems have 16 or fewer CPU cores. Your solution 
with its proposed default eats more memory for any system with fewer 
than 19 CPUs.
Furthermore, you don't need 224*NR_CPUS*NR_CPUS counters.  If an IRQ is 
only mapped into one CPU's space it can only be taken on that CPU, thus 
you only need 224*NR_CPUS counters.
