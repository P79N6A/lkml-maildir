Can I too whinge about that?
Shortly after the 2.6 merge window opened, various changes went in which
completely broke a number of the merged changes in the ARM tree.  That
resulted in the stuff which I thought was safe to merge becoming unsafe,
and with that I dropped all the changes which conflicted.
In some cases, these merge conflicts came about due to a bug fix I had
to put in to make the kernel bootable on ARM again.
I'm still in the middle of rebuilding the resulting mess from that - and
we're not yet back to where we were prior to the 2.6.24 release.  So, the
current version of the ARM tree which you most likely pulled for -mm1 is
incomplete with respect to what was planned to go in.  Therefore, you can
expect to see quite a number of apparantly "new" changes appearing in it
as these problems are resolved.
They're not really new, they're just the old stuff with the merge conflicts
fixed.
I don't see any end to these bun fights at the start of the merge window.
I believe it's inevitable given the work flow that we're now using.
