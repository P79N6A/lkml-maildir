PS:
I wonder if it wouldn't be better to migrate ieee1394 core away from
skb_*. I didn't look thoroughly at it yet but the benefit of using this
API appears quite low to me.
We use it to keep track of IEEE 1394 transactions [ = outgoing request
&& (incoming response || expiry)], with completion of transactions often
in-order due to mostly single-threaded usage, but sometimes out-of-order
(may happen regardless of multithreaded or single-threaded usage).
