Not for writes.  POLLOUT may be returned when the kernel thinks you have
enough memory to do a write, but someone else may allocate memory before
you call write().  Or does POLLOUT not work this way?
For read, you still want to declare the sockets non-blocking so your
code is robust on _other_ operating systems.  It's pretty straightforward.
