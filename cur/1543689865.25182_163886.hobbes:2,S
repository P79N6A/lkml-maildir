It doesn't require 7, it just prefers 7.

I think these changes should be only done with CONFIG_X86_GENERIC is set.
Otherwise the people who want kernels really optimized for their CPUs
won't get the full benefit. On UP it does not make that much difference,
but on a SMP kernel having a bigger than needed cache size wastes a lot
of memory.
