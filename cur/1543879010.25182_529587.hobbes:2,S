spawn on demand would require heuristics and complexity though. And
I think there is barely any positive tradeoff to weigh it against.

There are a few per CPU, but they should need no human management to
speak of.
Presumably if you have a 1024 CPU system, you'd generally want to be
running at least 1024 of your own processes there, so you already need
some tools to handle that magnitude of processes anyway.

User tools should be improved. It shouldn't be too hard to be able to
aggregate kernel thread stats into a single top entry, for example.
I'm not saying the number of threads couldn't be cut down, but there
is still be an order of magnitude problem there...
