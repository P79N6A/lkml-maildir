Can you reproduce with a smaller test setup?  Say just the 6 reiserfs
partitions of 100MB each?  Is a mix of filesytems required to trigger
the bug or can you trigger with reiser alone?
I'm having a hard time triggering here, but since your oopsen so
consistently include roughly the same paths in reiserfs, I'd expect this
isn't a scsi problem.  I've got an aic7892 card, so our test setups are
at least similar.
