And the simple answer to this (oh I've been here before) is to leave
the existing serial allocations well alone.
Then, you allocate a new major number and device name for the dynamically
assigned space and arrange for the serial layer to map these new chardevs
to the real serial ports.
*However* you still run into the issue that you do not know how many
serial ports you will need to register a tty driver with the tty layer.
Solve that technical problem and the idea of having a single namespace
for chosen serial ports and 8250 ports suddenly becomes realistic.
Continue ignoring that problem and this thread will just grow with zero
real progress.
I'm repeating myself though.
