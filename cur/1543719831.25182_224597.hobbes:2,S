The mount process shouldn't be in kernel_t, although that shouldn't
cause a hang.  Is /sbin/init labeled properly?  Are you using the
patched /sbin/init that loads policy and then re-execs itself into the
proper security domain?
What output did you get from SELinux during initialization, particularly
for hda5?
When the mount process is hung, what output do you get from pressing
ALT-SysRq-t after enabling sysrq (echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq)?
Most likely location for a hang would be when post_create invokes
inode->i_op->setxattr to set the attribute on the newly created file. 
Inode semaphore is taken around the call, as per other invocations of
inode->i_op->setxattr.
