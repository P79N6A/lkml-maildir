Subject: [PATCH 0/5] introduce K64BIT=y and backward compatibility ARCH={i386,x86_64} for x86
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

As discussed in another thread the right thing is to add a generic solution
to select between 32 and 64 bit - useable for powerpc, s390, ppc et al.
First step was to teach kconfig how to force 64BIT to a specific value.
The x86 Kconfig file needed a small twist to use 64BIT as the symbol
to seelct 32 or 64 bit.
Then it was simple to add backward compatibility ARCH= settings.
The patchset is not yet pushed out - I will await a bit feedback first.
Shortlog and diffstat.
      kconfig: factor out code in confdata.c
      kconfig: use $K64BIT to set 64BIT with all*config targets
      x86: Use CONFIG_64BIT to select between 32 and 64 bit in Kconfig
      kconfig: document make K64BIT=y in README
      x86: introduce ARCH=i386,ARCH=x86_64 to select 32/64 bit

The majority of the diffstat is the code refactoring of confdata.c
The rest is simple changes.
Patches follows...
Patches are on top of the patchset to introduce "make ARCH=x86"
