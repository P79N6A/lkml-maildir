Hi,
There is a difference in the documentation: Documentation/Changes says you
need at least gcc-2.7.2.3 for 2.2, README says that version 2.7.0 is
okay. (Changed to 2.7.2.3)
The Ramdisk size is adjusted dynamically since the new ramdisk code in 1.3.
Is it changeable by rdev any more? (Removed the ramdisk example)
All examples are for the i386 CPU (cp ..i386/boot/zImage..). How is it on
other architectures? I don't know, I think you don't need a compressed
image at all? (added "in case of a i386 compatible CPU")
ksymoops is now a C programm
The rest is 2.1 -> 2.2 cosmetic
