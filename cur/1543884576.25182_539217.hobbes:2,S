why do you care if the userspace tool that does the resizing makes system 
calls to one layer or to two layers? how would you know?
currently you see that they are seperate becouse you use two different 
tools to manipulate them, but if it was one tool that manipulated both of 
them for the common cases you wouldn't know. (this is the point that Diego 
was trying to make)
