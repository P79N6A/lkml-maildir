Subject: [patch] remove bouncing email address of Olaf Kirch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The email address for Olaf Kirch listed in net/sunrpc/auth.c bounces, so 
remove it and leave just the name. He's listed with the same email in 
CREDITS, should the address stay or would a patch to remove it there as 
well be appreciated?  I've been unable to find a working address for him 
(if someone knows of one, then changing the address would probably be 
better), and it doesn't seem logical to keep bouncing addresses around.  
What's the general opinion on this?
