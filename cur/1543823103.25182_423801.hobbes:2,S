One more point
When above no-bitmap patches was included, the user of not-aligned zones
are only ia64, I think. Because ia64 used virtual mem_map, page_to_pfn(page)
on  CONFIG_DISCONTIG_MEM doesn't access page struct itself. 
#define page_to_pfn(page)	(page - vmemmap)
So, it didn't  panic. ia64/vmemmap was safe.
If other archs used not-aligned zone + CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM,
not-aligned-zones problem would come out earlier.
