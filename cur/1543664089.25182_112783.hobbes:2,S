It is there in case some one might want nanosleep to NOT be folded 
into clock_nanosleep.  For a while this was a moving target and I got 
a bit paranoid  :)  I see no real reason to keep it...

Actually I have coded a better function as part of the expanded 
high-res-timers which does a 64-bit/32-bit div in a much cleaner way. 
  Again, it is part of the full high-res-timers patch.  I have been 
thinking of submitting the complete set of these math routines outside 
of the high-res patch.  They are designed to make scaled math easy.  I 
  have both a generic and a i386 header file, but they still need a 
bit of testing.
The issue is getting around the C limitation of not being able to use 
the div and mpy instructions that take 64-bits/32-bits and return 2 
32-bit results and the mpy which takes 2 32-bit operands and returns a 
64-bit result.
For scaled operations, they also roll a shift into the mix in an 
efficient way (i.e. a small inline asm function).
