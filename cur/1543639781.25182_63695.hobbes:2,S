Hello,
  I have a dual athlon system as well which does not 
normally reboot under Linux.  FreeBSd and Windows work 
fine but a stock Linux kernel does very weird things 
when rebooting.  My board is the Tyan Thunder K7 
(S2462UNG) and I solved the problem by booting with 
reboot=warm.  Hope that helps.
