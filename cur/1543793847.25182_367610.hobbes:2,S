  Sorry, I'll avoid that in the future.  With Evolution, If you
highlight part of the message before you reply it will include the
highlighted portions in the reply and disregard the sig mark.  Do you
have specific comments about this patch?  I think this patch is short
enough to cut-n-paste, so I'll refrain from re-posting unless you have
objections.  Thanks,
	Alex
