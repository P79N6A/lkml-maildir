I'm replying again to the original post, because I want to avoid the
predictable holy war that has erupted.
Mr. Misra's difficulty had nothing to do with C/C++ wars. It came from the
headers' reliance on a [bug,quirk,feature,extension] of gcc.
Even if the kernel itself is forever joined at the hip to gcc-2.7.2, it
would be only civilized to arrange for the headers to be legal ANSI. Many of
them are, but certainly not all.
Who will be maintaining gcc-2.7.2 after 2.9.5 is released?
Will kernel developers reject the new C standard?
If the answers include "nobody" or "yes", then there's trouble ahead.
Regards,
Tom
