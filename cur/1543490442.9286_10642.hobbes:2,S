Hi Brethren,
Looking through the sources I found arch-stub.c files for ppc and sparc,
so I guess I need the i386-stubs.c file if it exists (or write one if it
doesn't). I don't mind to start writing this from scratch but surely
someone has done it already? Especially since there is an int 3 (#ifdef
0'd though) in arch/i386/boot/bootsect.S with the comment "hook for a
debugger" already...
Regards,
Tigran
