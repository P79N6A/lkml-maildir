Hmm.
Please don't do that CLONE_STARTUP flag thing. Just do the code inside the 
sys_clone_startup(), instead of dynamically adding a new flag. And that 
code looks like it returns EFAULT without freeing the stuff it has 
allocated.
Also, "caching" &tsk->thread only adds code - even if it makes the sources
slightly shorter. It adds a register that is just a constant offset from
another register.
Other than that the thing seems to make sense.
