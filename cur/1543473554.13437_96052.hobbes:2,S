They used thermite (iron rust + aluminum dust) to demonstrate the concept
of an exothermic reaction in my freshman chemistry class.  They ignited it
in a little flower pot and I remember the pot glowing red while molton iron
ran out the hole in the bottom.  I can not imagine how much heat a
bathtub full of thermite would generate.  I am sure things would get
interesting after it melted through the bottom of the tub :-)
