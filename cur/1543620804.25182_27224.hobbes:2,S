It is an old TV show showing a queue overflow - The chocolate machine was
producing candy faster than the personnell could handle and dispose of it.
I think it was being boxed - the skit starts out with the machine on slow,
and a brief training session by a supervisor. The supervisor verifies that
the candy was handled properly at the slow speed. Then she leaves. The
machine makes a sudden jump in production, close to the limit of the
personnel (Lucy and Vivian) who just manage to keep up.
Then the machine gradually increases the production rate. At first, they
toss exess in to another box, then start trying to eat it, then dropping
on the floor .... until the supervisor returns to turn off the maching.
