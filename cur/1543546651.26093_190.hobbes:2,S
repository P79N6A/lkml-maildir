It doesn't determine INITRD_START, it gets this information directly
from the bootloader.  The problem you're having is that syslinux and
the kernel disagree slightly on exactly where your top of ram lies.
(e820 reporting problem seems likely, and in setup.S there's this
little goodie..
   280  #ifndef STANDARD_MEMORY_BIOS_CALL
   281     movb  %al, (E820NR)
..to help you verify that)
Were I in your shoes, I'd report this to David Parsons and Chris Noe..
they've done the most recent work in this area.  I've taken the liberty
of adding cc's in case they're interested.

It'd be a bit easier to modify the kernel you ship to blindly trust the
bootloader.  A much better approach would be to track down the booboo.
