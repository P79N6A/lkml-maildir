  OK, I'll believe you ;) I was never completely sure what all can happen
if two processors access+write some memory without exclusion by a lock...

  Yes, that was actually the reason why I changed the checks from
list_empty() to b_assoc_map testing. Well, so I'll add the barrier and
maybe also change these list_empty() checks to b_assoc_map tests...
