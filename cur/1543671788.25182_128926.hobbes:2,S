This failure is expected behavior, AFAICT. The module.ko has the module 
name embedded and thus duplicate insertion will be recognized even when 
the .ko file has been renamed.
To allow insertion of a module under a new name, you have to give
module-init-tools some new option (which I can't remember right now).
