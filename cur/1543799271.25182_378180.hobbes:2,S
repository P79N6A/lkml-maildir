Linus,
I'm glad you said that and I have to second that opinion.  
On our current product, we compile everything we need into the kernel; we don't use Alsa as modules at all.  Our system is "embedded" as far as the user is concerned (though in many ways is just a general purpose computer running a custom stripped down distribution), and the monolithic kernel is critical to our boot speed (under 1 minute till all services are running) and filesystem size.  
In addition, it makes maintenance and porting much easier: Step 1 - reconfigure and recompile the kernel; Step 2 - put bzImage in our update tarball.  Easy.  I can't imagine what a pain it would be to have to "install" the modules in our filesystem image.
Thankfully, we've never had to deal with this sort of failure; all of our Alsa drivers and services have been well behaved (mostly).
