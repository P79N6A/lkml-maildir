I didn't mention locking because it seemed obvious that locking is
needed.  Of course a flag alone is mostly useless.
But we already _do_ have a lock (dev->sem) and we _don't_ have a flag.  
I was pointing out that some drivers will want to have a flag added.
Maybe so many drivers will want it that the flag should be added to the
PM structure, where it will be available for every device.  If only a
few drivers want this new flag, then yes, they can put it in their
private data structures.

Relying on a registration failure to handle this sort of thing is _not_
a good idea.  For example, how would the driver distinguish failure
caused by impending suspend from other sorts of failure?
