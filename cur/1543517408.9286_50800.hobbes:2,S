removes are trivial with rbtrees as you never need to compare nodes. All
the rebalancing is done in function of the node color (that is a private
information of each node). The same is true also for the
insert-rebalancing, but to do an insert you must first browse the tree to
do a normal ordered O(log(n)) insert before calling the rebalance (thus a
compare semantic on elements is necessary for the insert operation to
work).
