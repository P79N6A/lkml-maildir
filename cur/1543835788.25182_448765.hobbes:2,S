This patch (b0423a0d9cc836b2c3d796623cd19236bfedfe63)
[PATCH] Remove duplicate code in signal.c
reverts a patch introduced by Linus long time back.

Was this intentional?
With the current mainline code, SIGSEGV inside a SIGSEGV handler will endup
in linux handling endless recursive faults.
Just wondering if this has been discussed before and is intentional.
thanks,
suresh
