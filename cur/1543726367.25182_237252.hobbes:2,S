The above sounds wrong / misguided.
First: "(mis)leading our users into thinking that their data is secure".
Security is not a yes/no matter. There are degrees of protection against
various possible attacks.
Second: This seems to be a discussion about cryptoloop vs dm-crypt.
But dm-crypt has the same weaknesses as cryptoloop, so from a crypto
point of view there is zero reason to switch.
If there is a reason to switch it must be elegance and correctness and
robustness of kernel implementation, together with the idea that we
do not need more than one kernel implementation of roughly speaking
the same concept. Not crypto, but just loop vs dm arguments.
Third: Announcing a date for the demise of cryptoloop seems a bit premature
at a point in time when dm-crypt is not quite usable yet.
I have the impression that cryptoloop and/or loop-aes presently are used by
more than your 5000 users.

So far, every time I checked the details Jari Ruusu has been right.
In the present discussion Fruhwirth Clemens showed an amazing lack
of understanding of cryptography. His threat model seems limited to
things like "chosen plaintext attack" etc.
But there are so many entirely different attacks.

A very strange reason. But maybe it fits in with dropping the idea
of a stable kernel.

Yes.
