IMO it would probably be best to try to re implement it in one go.
It shouldn't have spread too far out of kernel/sched.c, and the arch
code should mostly be implementable in terms of their sched_clock().
Mundane but not difficult.
Making arch code actually try to do the right thing may require a
bit more thinking, to handle both the variable time counter issue
and your time counter wrap problem. That wouldn't be your problem
though, outside arch/arm/
