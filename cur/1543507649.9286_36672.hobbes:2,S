Hi,
    Is there a way to determine the page offset (usually 0xC0000000)
from a loaded kernel module dynamically? This becomes a problem when
trying to insert modules into kernels that might have a different page
offset than the one the module was compiled with. For example, if the
PAGE_OFFSET macro in  page.h has been changed to say 0x80000000 to
accomodate a 2g + 2g kernel/user space as opposed to the more usual 1g
+ 3g kernel/user division
this will cause the module that uses the wrong PAGE_OFFSET value to do
extremely weird things.  Is there a
consistent,  relatively kernel-independent way of dealing with this?
    I would appreciate if you would also copy me on any responses.
Thanks in advance,
Sumanth
