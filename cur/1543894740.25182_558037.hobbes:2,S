it would be awesome if the checkpatch.pl script could distinguish between 
indentation and alignment space usage - this is going to cause major confusion 
with patch submitters.
I personally think that the sentence
   "use tabs for indents and spaces for alignment"
should also be in the CodingStyle document to avoid confusion.
