Hi,
Nat Ersoz wrote a couple of weeks back about systems that he has
without PS/2 (or AT) keyboards attached, and he mentioned a possible
solution.  I have done a minimal implementation of that solution
for 2.4.20.  Nat has tested it on a system with an IR keyboard and is
ready to ship it.  :)  I have tested it on a system with a USB
keyboard.  Both of these systems have a PS/2 keyboard controller
on them but no PS/2 keyboard attached.
I know that 2.5 has a different solution for this, but this is
now available for 2.4 for anyone who needs it.
This introduces CONFIG_PSKEYBOARD for i386, which defaults to Yes/ON,
so you'll need to disablel this option to use/test it, and it's
marked Experimental, so you'll need to enable Experimental also.
This eliminates some keyboard timeouts and messages such as:
| keyboard: Timeout - AT keyboard not present?(ed)
| keyboard: Timeout - AT keyboard not present?(f4)
| "pc_keyb: controller jammed 0xFF"
and it makes booting faster on systems that were experiencing
such keyboard timeouts.
Comments?
