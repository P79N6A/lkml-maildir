Do you really know that the driver don't get the stuck packet. Or is it possible
that the kernels network stack does the fault?
I'm asking because I have a similar problem with udp and kernel 2.6.7-rc2-mm2.
My sendto gets stuck sometimes and only continues if the kernel handles another
network packet.
But maybe my problem is a totally different one.
Regards,
Martin
