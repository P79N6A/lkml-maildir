Hm, I thought I had more CPU to spare, but when I set the readahead to a large 
value, I'm taking ~100% of the CPU time on the CPU doing the read.  ~98% of 
that is system time.  When I run 8 copies (this is an 8 CPU system), I get 
~4GB/s and all the CPUs are near fully busy.  I guess things aren't as bad as 
I initially thought.
Thanks,
Jesse
