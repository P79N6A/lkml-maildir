Hello,
I found at Google that the AM53C974 was removed since 2.6.0. My problem is: 
This driver is the only one that ever worked (2.4 kernels) for my TEAC CD 
writer. The tmscsim doesn´t do its job and that has nothing to do with the 
latency thing with SCSI-2.
Is there a chance you could put the AM53C974 back in the kernel? Otherwise I 
will not be able to burn CDs under linux anymore :-(
Thanks for comments in advance
Christian
