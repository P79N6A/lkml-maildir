There is no problem with that. However, things in Linux get implemented
usually because users require them. For now, users want PPP, Frame
Relay, Cisco HDLC.

Of course. But nobody just wanted it.

No, there is no specification. You can get the idea by browsing hdlc*.c
and include/linux/hdlc.h file (using a modern kernel + my hdlc patch).

The kernel source is open, anyone can add the support.
No special hooks seem necessary. For now, it can do FR, PPP (via
syncppp.c), Cisco, and X.25 is done using Linux X.25 + LAPB stack.

It seems unrelated. Of course the HDLC code interfaces with the network
code. I'd stay away from tty as sync serial devices are rarely used for
TTY-alike communications, and no tty drivers exist for most of such cards.
Obviously, particular driver can support tty mode if needed, or new
"protocol" can be implemented which does exactly that.
