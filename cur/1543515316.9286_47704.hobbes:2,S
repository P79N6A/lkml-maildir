Ted, you are assuming people will build stuff on the machine they are
running from. Its certainly a convenient assumption for the majority
of uses  but a lot of big have all their kernel building/images in one
place not around machines.
I'm not convinced /usr/include/linux is sufficient.  Perhaps we need
a more explicit naming ?
