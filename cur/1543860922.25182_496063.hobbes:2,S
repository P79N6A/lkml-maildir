Al is correct, of course.  But the patch takes bad_inode.o from 280 up to 703
bytes, which is a bit sad for some cosmetic thing which nobody ever looks
at or modifies.
Perhaps you can do
static int return_EIO_int(void)
{
	return -EIO;
}
static int bad_file_release(struct inode * inode, struct file * filp)
	__attribute__((alias("return_EIO_int")));
static int bad_file_fsync(struct inode * inode, struct file * filp)
	__attribute__((alias("return_EIO_int")));
etcetera?
