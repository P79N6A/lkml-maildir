Ahhh.... I think I misread what Chris wrote here - _32_ bit inodes on
32 bit platforms not working? I can't see how this would be the
case with the mods I posted given that they are entirely internal to
XFS and don't change any external inode number interfaces. And the
above commit shouldn't break XFS either.
Cheers,
Dave.
