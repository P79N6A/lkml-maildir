Subject: [PATCH] PS/2 mouse rate setting

My KVM doesn't like the new default of psmouse_rate=200. The mouse
felt very "jumpy" and was unconvenient to use. 
Unfortunately the setting could be only changed when the mouse driver
was a module. But I tend to have the mouse driver compiled in.
This patch fixes this by adding an __setup for it too.
Also it fixes an off by one bug to make sure that psmouse_rate=60
really gives 60 samples per second and not 40.
Overall as KVM user I must say I'm not very happy with the 2.6 mouse
driver. 2.4 pretty much worked out of the box, but 2.6 needs
lots of strange options (psmouse_noext, psmouse_rate=80) 
because it does things very differently out of the box.
