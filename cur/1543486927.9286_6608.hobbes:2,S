[SNIPPED Machine info]
The current time-keeping in the kernel isn't too good. Here is
a log of the daily resetting of time to NIST
Reference time = Fri Feb 12 16:54:16 1999
       My time = Fri Feb 12 16:54:17 1999
    Difference = 1 seconds

The times where there was little skew were times in which the machine
was recently rebooted. In this case, the time is always set to NIST
as soon as the network is up.
So it's typically off by -14 seconds in a 24 hour period. This is
a dual pentium 400 MHz machine with an Intel chip-set.
