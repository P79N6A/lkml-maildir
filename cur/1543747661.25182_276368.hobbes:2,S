This happens when a sys_wait* call tries to reap a process, but then has
some problem like EFAULT.  It then abandons the reaping attempt by turning
DEAD back into ZOMBIE, so another sys_wait* call can succeed later.  So,
during this brief window it can be in DEAD though it in fact is never
reaped and the PID remains bound to that task_struct throughout.
If you don't want to rule out ZOMBIE, you can't really rule out DEAD.
Thanks,
Roland
