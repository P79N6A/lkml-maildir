Um, no. Volume managers allow you to span a volume across multiple disks. But 
a filesystem (and thus all of its files) is still fully contained within a 
single volume. IOW, volume management is a method for managing block-devices. 
Filesystems are a method for managing files. There is a distinct line between 
them.
