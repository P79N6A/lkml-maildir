The numbers I have seen show that performance is decreased. People
like Ken Chen spend months trying to find a 0.05% improvement in
performance. Not long ago I just spent days getting our cached
kbuild performance back to where 2.4 is on my build system.
I can simply see they will cost more icache, more dcache, more branches,
etc. in what is the hottest part of the kernel in some workloads (kernel
compiles, for one).
I'm sorry if I sound like a wet blanket. I just don't look at a patch
and think "wow all those 3 guys with Linux on IBM mainframes and using
lpars are going to be so much happier now, this is something we need".

You have an extra zone. You size that zone at boot according to the
amount of memory you need to be able to free. Only easy-reclaim stuff
goes in that zone.
It is less complex because zones are a complexity we already have to
live with. 99% of the infrastructure is already there to do this.
If you want to hot unplug memory or guarantee hugepage allocation,
this is the way to do it. Nobody has told me why this *doesn't* work.
