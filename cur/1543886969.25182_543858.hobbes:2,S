Well I think so, but not completely sure. OTOH, I admit this is one
of the more contentious speedups ;) It is likely to be vary a lot by
the arch (I think the P4 is infamous for expensive locked ops, others
may prefer not to mix the byte sized ops with word length ones).
But that aside, I'd still like to do the lock page in nopage and get
this bug fixed. Now it is possible to fix some other way, eg we could
use another page flag (I'd say it would be better to use that flag for
PG_waiters and speed up all PG_locked users), however I think it is fine
to lock the page over fault. It gets rid of some complexity of memory
ordering there, and we already have to do the wait_on_page_locked thing
to prevent the page_mkclean data loss thingy.
I haven't seen a non-microbenchmark where it hurts.
