I recompiled the kernel with IDE-SCSI, preemption, taskfile, and a few
other things disabled. With the result that it worked. But of course I
can't _write_ DVDs without IDE-SCSI (short of obtaining a SCSI
writer)... I will now reenable features one by one to be sure it's an
IDE-SCSI problem. But it looks like IDE-SCSI has major problems reading
DVDs, mostly looking like this:
Dec 15 13:15:20 amphibian kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
Dec 15 13:15:20 amphibian kernel: sr0: rw=0, want=2830152, limit=1329420
Dec 15 13:15:20 amphibian kernel: Buffer I/O error on device sr0,
logical block +707537
Either it gets such errors when mounting, or after mounting - almost
always when mounting.
Is there any way to record DVDs without using IDE-SCSI?
