Wow, I'm impressed!  I didn't realize that kgdb worked on Alpha...Were 
you using the remote kgdb?  (You can answer me offline to save 
bandwidth.)  This would be a _huge_ help in trying to figure out why my 
Wildfire^WGS160 is crashing with the DISCONTIGMEM code that I stole from 
Jay and have been hacking on.
Speaking of that system, it has two QLogic adapters in it (both 1040Bs, 
like the Miata), and they are working just fine under 2.4.0-test11 
(obviously, without my changes ;).  It looks like it's probably the 
platform code that's busted.  I can't remember...are those Pyxis or 
CIA?  Anyway, could this have something to do with the PCI & PCI bridge 
work that Richard and Ivan just submitted?
