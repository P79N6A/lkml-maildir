I am still do not understand why this is needed. Would it not be
simplier just to use a reference to struct device instead of embedding
it in a larger structure if their lifetimes are different and one does
not have a subsystem that takes care of releasing logic.
Pretty much drivers have 2 options:
struct my_device {
        void *private_data;
        struct device dev;
};
In this case ->release must live in a subsystem code; individual
drivers kfree(my_dev->private) and do any additional cleanup after
calling device_unregister(&my_dev->dev);
Second option:
struct my_device {
        type member1;
        type member2;
       struct device *dev;
};
dev is coming from _device_create(). Driver core takes care of
releasing dev structure; driver does cleanup of my_device.
With current sysfs orphaning attributes upon removal request there is
no issue of accessing driver-private data through references obtained
via ether embedded or referenced dev structure so everything is fine.
