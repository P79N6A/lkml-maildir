This area is so murky, it verges on religion. Thus, I really think
this ought to be submitter's preference.
Any attempt to make a hard and fast rule of what's considered GPL or
not will potentially dilute any legal protection for exported symbols
predating the existence of the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL mechanism that are
nonetheless only reasonably used by GPL code (which by some
contributors' measures is all of them). 
In other words, we must be careful not to directly or indirectly
construe EXPORT_SYMBOL as a carte blanche for linking GPL-incompatible
code.
