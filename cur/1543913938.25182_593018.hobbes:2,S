There are several different problems in this thread:
1. The removal of old sk98lin driver caused some users to be forced to use
    skge. These users have uncovered issues with the dual port fiber based versions
    of the board.  
    Short term: The sk98lin driver should be restored to previous state, 
       and the PCI table should be used to limit the usage to only fiber systems.
       If Adrian doesn't do it, I'll do it when I return from Germany.
    Long term: I have fiber based board (thanks ebay) on the way to resolve
       skge bug.
2. Sky2 driver has it's own fiber based problems.  Solve these after skge fiber.
3. Sky2 doesn't have as many workarounds for hardware problems as vendor sk98lin
    driver.
