While you not mentioning your drive manufacturer, I bet for
IBM (you know, what this acronym stands for: idiots build...)
Actually not all of them, but definitely those, who try to engender
ide harddisks. 
If my bet is right, search for discussions on ibm hd corruption here.
Basically, if you powercycle your system during a write operation,
affected blocks will return hard read errors on future access.
The likelyhood for affecting /var is high. Here it happened
during a procmail delivery of lkml messages.
Try to return those drives to your dealer.
