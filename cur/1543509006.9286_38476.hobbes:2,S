Hi All,
   What is the current state of the following in the 2.3.18 kernel (i386):
vfat - is it stable/safe to enable write support yet?
scsi - is there anything major being changed which would cause me to get:
insmod: /lib/modules/2.3.18/scsi/scsi_mod.o: unresolved symbol 
init_task_union
(this is with Advansys controller & cdrom/generic device support)
serial ports - as of 2.3.16+ I can't use the serial ports without major 
               hassels anymore. I kills the mouse and sets the send light
               on the modem on permanently. 
Just wondering what's in alterations and is this normal with this kernel.
Cheers,
