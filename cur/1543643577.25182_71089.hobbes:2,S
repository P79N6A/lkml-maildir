The notion was that some level of parallelism would be bestowed on the
single-node case by using separate worker threads on a per-zone basis,
as they won't have more than one node to spawn worker threads for at all.
This notion apparently got shot down somewhere, and I don't care to rise
to its defense. I've lost enough debates this release to know better than
to try.
