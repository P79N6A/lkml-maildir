If it is supposed to implement the MS SideShow API, then that would be
the .NET VM (i.e. C#).  My 10 second googling turned up some info about
that but I couldn't find a definition of how the hardware interface
for such devices is supposed to work.  There's some XML-laden software
API but it seemed to be transport agnostic.
