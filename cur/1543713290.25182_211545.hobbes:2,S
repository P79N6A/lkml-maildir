A factor of 2 or 3 though?
In 2.4, to ls -lA my home directory with its 510 files, took less than
0.5 sec. Currently, buffering via cat in 2.6 takes 0.5 sec. Just
straight ls -lA takes 6 seconds or so.
Does your factor of 3 bring you up to what you were seeing in 2.4, or
do you still have a regression?
