It avoids overhead both in terms of memory and processing in the kernel 
and it seems that is the way we have traditionally dealt with the issue?
Nodes without memory require the VM to allocate memory from different
nodes in order to build up management structures for the node (these
are useless since the node has no memory, caches will be split etc etc).
The cpus will allways fallback to the next node anyways since 
their zonelist begins with a zone in a node that has memory.

I am not sure how memoryless nodes would affect various subsystems. And it 
seems that this patch only fixes the first issue that they found (?). If 
we go down this route then we may have to add more special casing to the 
VM in order to cleanly handle memoryless nodes.
But maybe someone else has already experience with memoryless nodes?
