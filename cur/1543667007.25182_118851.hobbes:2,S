We already have that.
int __ext3_journal_stop(const char *where, handle_t *handle)
{
	struct super_block *sb;
	int err;
	int rc;
	sb = handle->h_transaction->t_journal->j_private;
	err = handle->h_err;
	rc = journal_stop(handle);
	sb->s_dirt = 1;
	if (!err)
		err = rc;
	if (err)
		__ext3_std_error(sb, where, err);
	return err;
}

I don't think it's a hack at all.  ext3 owns the journal and there is plenty
of precedent for putting owner-private things into owned objects.
But I'm not particularly fussed either way - it will only be 100-200 bytes of
code saved.

It could be due to differences in inode reclaim.  If 2.4 sees an inode with
attached pages it will skip it.  2.5 will instead detach the pages and free
the inode.
And writepage() doesn't get used much in 2.4.
Plus this bug was hit on a preemptible kernel where the timing windows are
much wider.

OK.

That is available from the handle.  (And via
ext3_journal_current_handle()->j_private, even).
The journal and the superblock have a definite one-to-one relationship - I think the
backpointer makes sense.  But whatever - I'll let you flip that coin.
