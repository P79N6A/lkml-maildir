Rusty, writing "Bzzzert" on lkml is juvenile, as is refering to your
peers as "shallow thinkers".  Ok, let's see if there is some content
in your post.

Huh?  Would you please back up and try to make a coherent point?
I'd love to point out why you're wrong, but you didn't actually
say anything.

As I recall, you are the one who proposed eliminating the ability
to unload modules entirely, because you were not able to solve the
unload races.  It's a good thing that people with more sense
shouted you down.
Now, let's be civilized about this.  If you have points, make them,
we do not need them decorated with sound effects.
