Just for info: If this goes in, Red Hat/Fedora kernels will fork
swsusp development, as this method just will not work there.
(We have a restricted /dev/mem that prevents writes to arbitary
 memory regions, as part of a patchset to prevent rootkits)
Even it were not for this, the whole idea seems misconcieved to me
anyway.
