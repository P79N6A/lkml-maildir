ok, but it would be nice to avoid having to turn these off. Could you 
try whether tuning the /proc/sys/kernel/*granularity* values (in 
particular wakeup_granularity) has any positive effect on your workload?
also, could you run your workload as SCHED_BATCH [via schedtool -B ], 
does that improve the results as well on a default-tuned kernel?
