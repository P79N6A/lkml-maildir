    Not in my copy of the SuS, version 2, but yes in my man page
about mmap(). Anyway, Linus told me that he doesn't like to change
the semantics for mmap, so it can return 0.
    I don't like mmap() returning 0, but I don't like too breaking
the old behaviour of the kernel. Moreover, 0 is returned only if the
length requested is 0 and the address passed as hint is 0 too... I
don't see any problem about it.
