That's my problem: I can't find them there. At least not directly.
It contains just two methods for each CPU: _PDC and _OSC.
Althrough the _OSC methods contain some logic and Load(...) calls, and 
there is a package supiciously looking like a directory containing 
some additional ACPI tables (for example "CPU0IST ", offset, length and so 
on). So, it's possible, that required tables are loaded "on demand" but 
not accesible with the acpidump.
