Ok. I guess (Yes I do :D) that there is an IRQ storm or something like that,
because you say that your system is becoming very slow and unresponsive.
It sounds like an IRQ is not ACKed correctly and so keeps triggering and
stalling the system. I'll take a look at a few diffs...
Do you see significant differences in the "hi" and/or "si" times in top?
Do you see a significant difference in the /proc/interrupts count. For
example that the kernel that works worse generates 10 times the IRQ count
for the same amount of data.
