Subject: inode->i_data.nrpages still used in clear_inode()

I am porting my "rawfs" (filesystem that makes it possible to mount
a complete disk and the partitions show up as files) to 2.3.29pre3.
It seems to work, and I can read/write files but when I unmount the
partition, clear_inode() is called for all used inodes and it calls
BUG() because inode->i_data.nrpages != 0.
The happens even if I mount the filesystem, dd a couple of blocks
from one of the files to /dev/null, and umount it.
Any idea where I should start looking? What uses i_data.nrpages /
what resource needs to be freed ?
Thanks for any hints
Mike.
