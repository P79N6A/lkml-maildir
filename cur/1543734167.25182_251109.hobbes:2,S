Subject: [ANNOUNCE] udev 031 release

I've released the 031 version of udev.  It can be found at:
 	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-031.tar.gz
udev allows users to have a dynamic /dev and provides the ability to
have persistent device names.  It uses sysfs and /sbin/hotplug and runs
entirely in userspace.  It requires a 2.6 kernel with CONFIG_HOTPLUG
enabled to run.  Please see the udev FAQ for any questions about it:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-FAQ
For any udev vs devfs questions anyone might have, please see:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev_vs_devfs
This release fixes a lot of little bugs since the 030 release.  I might
have missed a few patches that were sent to me, and if you don't see
your patch/fix included in here, please resend it.
Major changes since 030:
 	- lots of minor bugfixes
	- udevstart is now a symlink to udev
	- added a new %e modifier
	- lots of rule fixes and cleanups based on user reports.
Thanks to everyone who has send me patches for this release, a full list
of everyone, and their changes is below.
udev development is done in a BitKeeper repository located at:
	bk://linuxusb.bkbits.net/udev
 Daily snapshots of udev from the BitKeeper tree can be found at:

If anyone ever wants a tarball of the current bk tree, just email me.
thanks,
