Your patch is fine to get people going... I'm glad you posted it on lkml 
for others to benefit.
However, for inclusion in the kernel, it is not needed.  Quite simply, 
mii.c is essentially a library, and it needs absolutely no 
initialization nor cleanup at all.  Thus, it is a bug in the module 
loader that any code changes at all are required.
There exists a no_module_init tag, which is in theory the proper fix for 
this problem under rusty's system, but that is itself a bug:  it's 
redundant just like the silly EXPORT_NO_SYMBOLS tag -- it's stating the 
obvious.  The module loader needs to notice a lack of init_module and 
exit_module and handle it accordingly.
