Well you are guaranteed that it will run. You just don't know how fast
it will run. The bottom-half code run off the timer-queue is run with
the interrupts enabled. It can get interrupted and it may be interrupted
by network driver code that loops in ISRs, taking a large percentage
of the CPU cycles.
So, I don't think you are measuring what you think you are measuring.
