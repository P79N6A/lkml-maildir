Both are true. If it only provided functionality, it wouldn't remount
filesystems read only on journal errors or the like.

I'm suggesting that people make mistakes, and they don't always read the
documentation or think of everything. These checks are there precisely
because people have messed up in the past, and to cover the case where
userspace isn't ready or able - for whatever reason - to do those checks
or tell the user they've done something wrong.
