Hello
As soon as I issue hdparm -Y /dev/hdb I get errors on hda and it doesn't
seem to be possible to have hdb in sleep and hfa active. In a book I've
read, that those power-states are purely per-device. Is the book wrong or
is it something different? It's a VIA ProSavage KM133 chipset.
Thanks
Guennadi
