I just like using existing code (kthread_stop) as much as possible and not add 
new code (->should_stop). Also the 'while (cwq->thread != NULL)' loop in
cleanup_workqueue_thread is not neat IMHO, compared to kthread_stop+wait_to_die.
Pls compare cleanup_workqueue_thread() in 2.6.20-mm1 and what is
proposed in the patch :-
2.6.20-mm1 (cwq->should_stop)
=============================
static void cleanup_workqueue_thread(struct cpu_workqueue_struct *cwq, int cpu)
{
        struct wq_barrier barr;
        int alive = 0;
        spin_lock_irq(&cwq->lock);
        if (cwq->thread != NULL) {
                insert_wq_barrier(cwq, &barr, 1);
                cwq->should_stop = 1;
                alive = 1;
        }
        spin_unlock_irq(&cwq->lock);
        if (alive) {
                wait_for_completion(&barr.done);
                while (unlikely(cwq->thread != NULL))
                        cpu_relax();
                /*
                 * Wait until cwq->thread unlocks cwq->lock,
                 * it won't touch *cwq after that.
                 */
                smp_rmb();
                spin_unlock_wait(&cwq->lock);
        }
}
Patch (based on kthread_should_stop)
====================================
static void cleanup_workqueue_thread(struct workqueue_struct *wq, int cpu)
{
        struct cpu_workqueue_struct *cwq = per_cpu_ptr(wq->cpu_wq, cpu);
        if (cwq->thread != NULL) {
                kthread_stop(cwq->thread);
                cwq->thread = NULL;
        }
}
The version using kthread_should_stop() is more simple IMO.

Ok ..I hadnt looked at 2.6.20-mm1 (it wasnt out when we posted the
patch). Neverthless I think most of our intended changes would apply for
2.6.20-mm1 also. We will post a new version (breaking down workqueue changes
as you want) against 2.6.20-mm1.

Ok ..no problem. Will not add the 'break' there!

Note with the change proposed in refrigerator, we can avoid
CPU_DEAD_KILL_THREADS and do all cleanup in CPU_DEAD itself.

What is more flexible abt cwq_should_stop()?
