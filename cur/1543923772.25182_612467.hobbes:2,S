Well that's probably the best bug report I've ever had, thanks Duane!
The issue is a silly thinko -- I didn't pay enough attention to the ptrace
rules in filemap_fault :( partly I think that's because I don't understand
them and am scared of them ;)
The following minimal patch fixes it here, and should probably be applied to
2.6.23 stable as well as 2.6.24. If you could verify it, that would be much
appreciated.
However I actually don't really like how this all works. I don't like that
filemap.c should have to know about ptrace, or exactly what ptrace wants here.
It's a bit hairy to force insert page into pagecache and pte into pagetables
here, given the races.
In access_process_vm, can't we just zero fill in the case of a sigbus? Linus?
That will also avoid changing applicatoin behaviour due to a gdb read...
Thanks,
Nick

Duane Griffin noticed a 2.6.23 regression that will cause gdb to hang when
it tries to access the memory of another process beyond i_size.
This is because the solution to the fault vs invalidate race requires that
we recheck i_size after the page lock is taken. However in that case, I
had not accounted for the fact that ptracers are granted an exception to this
rule.
