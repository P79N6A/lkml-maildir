I don't want to be mean, but does anyone actually use STGT in
production? Seriously?
In the latest development version of STGT, it's only possible to stop
the tgtd target daemon using KILL / 9 signal - which also means all
iSCSI initiator connections are corrupted when tgtd target daemon is
started again (kernel upgrade, target daemon upgrade, server reboot etc.).
Imagine you have to reboot all your NFS clients when you reboot your NFS
server. Not only that - your data is probably corrupted, or at least the
filesystem deserves checking...
