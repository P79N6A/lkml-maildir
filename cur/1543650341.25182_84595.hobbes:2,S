In the paper the accuracy of measurement is 1ms.  Current hardware has 
tsc precision of nanoseconds, or about 6 orders of magnitude more 
accuracy.  Doesn't this mean that we can pump in many more bits into the 
  algorithm and get out many more than the 100bits/min that the setup in 
the paper acheives?

Is it that straightforward? In the paper they go through a number of 
stages designed to remove correlated data.  From what I remember of the 
linux prng disk-related stuff it is not that sophisticated.

If this is truly a concern, what about having a separate disk used for 
nothing but generating randomness?
