But the reality of X is what we have to deal with.
This scheduler seems to close the corner cases of the interactivity
estimator, but this "any background load is palpable" thing is decidedly
detrimental to interactive feel.
When I looked into keeping interactive tasks responsive, I came to the
conclusion that I just couldn't get there from here across the full
spectrum of cpu usage without a scheduler hint.  Interactive feel is
absolutely dependent upon unfairness in many cases, and targeting that
unfairness gets it right where heuristics sometimes can't.
