In case if you follow comp.protocols.time.ntp occasionally, you will 
find out that a lot of problems are related to problems where Linux 
does not update the RTC properly (e.g. when running localtime, not 
UTC). Let's say HP-UX 11.0 is a real UNIX if that helps you. I'm also 
aware that the RTC update code is basically unchanged since Linux-
0.99.

Maybe you have a real Internet connection, possibly even at home. 
Different here.
