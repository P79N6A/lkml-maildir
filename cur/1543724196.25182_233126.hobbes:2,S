How much RAM do you have? Does this happen with and without Con's
patch?
I don't have a problem here with your problem, however I'm running
my -np patchset, which has different use-once heuristics.

Page reclaim doesn't really know or care about processes, it
basically works on a global page pool.
pdflush is used to perform writeout of dirty data, so it has

problem is that mozilla's resident memory gets evicted too easily,
is that right?
