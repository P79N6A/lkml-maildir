What i consider decoding is everything from the file to the audio going 
to the audio device. This means moving the audio from your decoder into 
the buffer you use to play sound.  The process may be set as realtime, 
but whether or not it's able to accomplish that is up to the code 
itself, usually you have more audio experienced programmers working on 
the output library/device.  Just because the decoder may be able to get 
cpu and resources when it asks for it within a bounded range doesn't 
mean it's able to accomplish what it's supposed to within that range all 
the time.  Otherwise explain why substituting different decoders results 
in different performances regarding audio skipping, that includes 
different decoders for different codecs and even the same ones. The 
audio programs themselves are responsible for the poor performances they 
get with current kernels much more than the kernel is, that point was my 
original subject.
yea, it's just as distinct per cycle as outputting audio is, but the 
players are not at a realtime quality, which they should be before 
people start using them to grade the kernel's "realtimeness".
