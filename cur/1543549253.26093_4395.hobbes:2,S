With point `p' I mean the request after last barrier in the queue.
With the current algorithm we can trivially account for p each time
we do elevator_sequence--. elevator_sequence can't go below zero
and we never play with stuff before the last barrier. So the first
time !--req->elevator_sequence is true we would know that req->next
is the new p (if it's not real_head).
Then we would insert at the left of p if the new req is lower than p.
With the modification instead we could have this queue:
	100[0]
Then we insert 102 103 and 104:
	100[0] 102[3] 103[3] 104[3]
	       p
Then when we try to insert 99 it goes here:
	100[0] 102[3] 103[3] 104[3] 99[3]
				    p
So we have two low peaks in the not starving queue and we should move the p
to the latest on the right.
Also we should make different cases in function of what p->prev is
(barrier/head/real_head/normalreq).
I don't think it's worthwhile (even with the current algorithm where it's easy
to account for p).
