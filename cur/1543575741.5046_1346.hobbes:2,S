I made similar experience but it also involved 2.2.18 in combination with
KDE2.0 and ALSA.
The machine "hung" but worked heavily on the HD and after about one hour it
worked abain at least on the console.
One thing I found was the current CVS from ALSA seems to have a bug.
Another thing is tha the 8139too driver prodices

Dec 13 12:34:19 eckhard kernel: eth0: Abnormal interrupt, status 00000002.

in /var/log/messages and the machine is getting very slow then.
This is even worse when compiled as a module.
With rlt8139 driver this does not happen. The chip is 8139A.
