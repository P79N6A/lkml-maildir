Early versions shipped on floppy disks labelled "OS/3."
Cutler had his team first write NT on MIPS and then port
to x86 to underscore the importance of portability (which
was recently tossed out the window).

That would be fine. We will be implementing a similar

filesystem whether or not any actual namespace or other
support is provided, as it is a cross-platform filesystem.

should try to provide named streams on Unix anyway.
I think it can be done, probably without goring
