I like.  This patch much improves things.
"SIOCDEVICE" as a constant is unacceptable, so it would need to be
SIOCWANDEVICE or something similar.
SIOCETHTOOL, for example, is an ioctl which actually provides
sub-ioctls, so that is probably a good model to follow.
More comments after I return from New York, and can review these at
length...
