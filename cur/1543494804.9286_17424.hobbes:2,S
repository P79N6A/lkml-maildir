I think it is official; I am sincerely sorry to say that R. B. Johnson is an
idiot. I am usually not this inflammatory but I can't take this anymore.
Here a colleague and I are ROFL while we read his responses but this takes
the price, "... tested if the assignment succeeded. ..." Anyone please tell
me how assignments fail in C? And this is after 3 quotes from the ANSI C and
K&R.
You know the categorization of people whether they are arrogant and/or
stupid. If the guy is smart and arrogant, you can deal with him because he
can be shown his mistakes. If he is stupid but humble, he accepts that he
may have made a mistake but if he is both stupid and arrogant, there is no
way to deal with him. I am glad I am not working for analogic.

Not so. Your first instance tested if the assignment succeeded. It
is a common error called 'boolean test of assignment' and is the
most common error I've seen in 'C' coding.
