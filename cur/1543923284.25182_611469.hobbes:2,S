Please don't - the fix is completely broken for multi-input devices -
if 2nd device fails to register we bail out of hidinput_connect and
thus never set HID_CLAIMED_INPUT bit. So when we disconnect device we
never call hidinput_disconnect and who knows what will happen after
that.
hidinput_connect() should properly unwind already registered devices
after failure.
