It's easy to conceive of a device which, for whatever reason, gives
an "absolute" reading accurate ±2°C, but which tracks temperature
changes somewhat more accurately.  And hence a small difference
between successive readings still has significance.  A real-world
example is a mercury thermometer in which the glass has been
physically shifted relative to an adjacent scale.  So 18°C reads as
20°C, etc.
Cheers,
Phil
