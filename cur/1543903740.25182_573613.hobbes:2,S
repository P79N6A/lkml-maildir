At least for s390 and powerpc the utime and stime already contain a very
precise value how much time was spent in the user and system context.
For s390 the granularity is a microsecond. The other values nice, idle,
iowait, irq, softirq and steal are precise as well.

With the exact accounting of utime and stime that would mean that
p->se.sum_exec_runtime is utime + stime, no?
Precise Accounting at every cpu context switch has some cost, but for
s390 it is not as bad as it sounds. We do 2 store-cpu-timer (STPT)
instructions, 2 64 bit adds and 2 64 bit subtracts. In terms of cycles
it is less than 30 cycles on each system entry on the latest machine.

Imho, we just have to update utime and stime when the process accounting
values are requested and set se.sum_exec_runtime to the sum of utime and
stime for CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING=y.
