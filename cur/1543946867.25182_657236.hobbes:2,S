In fact the driver can find out in which state to put the device into,

Yes, we do.  There are devices that need to be suspended with interrupts off.

That is, unless the user pulls out that pendrive while suspended, no?

We do, if there are devices that wake us up from S4 and don't wake us up from
S5, for example.  Plus this f*cking fan in my box that doesn't work after the
resume if we don't do ->poweroff() ...

Apart from putting devices into the right low power states, that is.

Your honor, I would like to register a differing opinion ...

That's absolutely correct.

Agreed.
