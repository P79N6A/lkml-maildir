Agree.  But that does not address the reasons OpenVZ and Vserver exist.

Disagree.  If you limit your self to just changing the code that
translates from names to objects it is a very narrow slice of code,
and there are very few surprises.  There is a lot of grunt work involved
but it easy to tell if you got everything and did it correctly.
Other approaches are more adhoc, take short cuts, and seem prone to missing
the corner cases.

Possibly.  That is very out from where we are at the moment.
Let's get the isolation and see where we are at.
