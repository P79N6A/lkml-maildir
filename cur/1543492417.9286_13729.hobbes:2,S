Hi Jonathan,
	Well, sure, 'login' would have to check somewhere to determine
what caps a user should have.  Most probably it would be better to add
this to the /etc/shadow file in the reserved field, then patch 'login' to
use that.  (this is an off the cuff suggestion, the glibc ppl may have a
better idea on this ;-)  And yes, _some_ user would need all caps set, or
at least the cap to set/modify 'setuid root' files (the equiv. of
'CAP_GOD' or whatever) otherwise it would be difficult to admin the box. I
guess 'getty' could also be modified to lower caps on all remote logins,
as well, regardless of (or in concert with)  /etc/securetty.
