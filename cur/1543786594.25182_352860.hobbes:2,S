Ingo already gave an example.  "a busy network server can easily have 
millions of timers pending. I once had to increase a server's 16 million 
tw timer sysctl limit ..."

I see two assumptions that lead to the API using nanoseconds:
1) it is desireable to have a human-time-unit timer API, so that people 
can specify timeouts in easily-understood units
2) eventually we will use sub-ms resolution timers, so it makes sense to 
just jump to nanoseconds as our base timing unit
Are these reasonable starting points, or is there disagreement on these?
Maybe it would make sense to have the API be in nanoseconds and 
internally use 32bit ms for now, and only change to 64bit nanos when we 
actually move to sub-ms resolution timers.
