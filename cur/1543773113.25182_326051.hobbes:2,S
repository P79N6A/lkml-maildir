Certainly.

To the best of my abilities, yes. I'd like to take a look at those 
patches. 
If nothing else it sounds like a good way for me to cut my current 
(extra warning enabled) build logs down to size and focus on the more 
relevant of the issues. And perhaps, if I can find the time for it, I can 
split the other patches you have into some sane chunks and start 
submitting them to the relevant maintainers.

Sounds like a resonable plan to me.  Send your stuff along and I'll put 
some time into it when and where I can find it :-)
