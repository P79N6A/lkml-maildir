I realize that, but is that a reason to keep linux from working with
these?  (And it's not just cisco, all the *BSDs (and therefore anything
that took the BSD stack such as MS) work this way too.)  As nearly as I
can tell, there's no way to make linux work with these, and the
situation I gave is one where linux could easily get it right, and
isn't.  Saying "They're broken.  Tough." is not really helpful.  At
least can we get a "work with broken other systems in certain
circumstances" switch somewhere?
(Funny you should mention Cisco, as we write routing software and must
interoperate with Cisco.  What Cisco says *does* go in the routing
community, if you wish your product to be used.  Currently, when our
customers come to us, we have to say "Either don't use Linux or run 2.2
with the arp fix patch.")
