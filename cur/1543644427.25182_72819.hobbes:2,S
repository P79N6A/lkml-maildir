I saw Paulus' post a few days ago. I'm fully aware that 2.5 is not ready 
for anything serious yet on ppc, I just became curious to know if I 
could get it to compile and run. I'll just keep on trying and posting 
small patches that I need to compile things. I don't have the time to do 
any real hacking, but a small patch now and then is doable ;-)
