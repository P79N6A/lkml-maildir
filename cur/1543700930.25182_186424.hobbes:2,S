I wont say I understand it, but a quick look seems the major change is
the addition of the 'whole-frag' and 'no-silence' opts.  You might try
the following to revert what 'no-silence' change at least does:
--
 # echo 'xmms 0 0 no-silence' > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss
 # echo 'xmms 0 0 whole-frag' > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss
--
and restart xmms.  If that do not work, then one of the alsa guys will
have to have a look.
