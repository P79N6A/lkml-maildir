No faster machine to compile on?  Still think this isn't a kernel problem 
anyway.

I was just hoping it would have a configuration screen shown after POST.  I 
had expected that it would show any active caches.  Doesn't seem so likely 
now though. *8/

Who knows what a Windows programme or driver might do in order to "fix" some 
problem?  I suppose it's possible that a programme like SiSoft Sandra might 
be able to tell if the L2 cache is active or not.  There is almost bound to 
be some programme that can read the appropriate configuration bits.

Annoying.  Can you think of anything you might have done with Windows 2000, eg 
programme run or device used, that you haven't done when testing?
