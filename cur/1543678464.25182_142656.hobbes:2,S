This is absolutely true -- but why is it relevant and to whom? 
OK, perhaps I see why it makes _vendors_ uneasy, but the _consumer_
doesn't lose out, and it's the consumer's money which drives the trend. 
There will always be companies around to provide whatever needs the
consumer is willing to pay for.
It may turn out that tomorrow's consumer is not willing to pay up-front
for software, at least _commodity_ software.
Markets come and markets go -- life will go on, as it always does.
