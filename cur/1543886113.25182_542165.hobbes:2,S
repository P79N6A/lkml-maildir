I am a mdadm/disk/hard drive fanatic, I was curious:

How come 32bit is 256 and 64 is only 128?
I am sure it is something very fundamental/simple but I was curious, I 
would think x86_64 would fit/support more scatterlists in a page.
Also, when this patch is implemented for x86_64 and if merged into 
mainline, what does this mean for performance?
I have an mdadm raid5 of 10 raptors and get 434MB/s write and 622MB/s 
read, would I see an increase in performance with this patch?
Justin.
