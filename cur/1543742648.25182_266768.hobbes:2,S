The problem with apps of this sort is the multiple layers of abstraction.
Xlib, GLib, GTK, GNOME, Pango, XML, etc.
No one wants to duplicate effort (rightly so).  Each of these libs tries
to do EVERY POSSIBLE thing.  They all end up bloated.  Then you have to
link them all in.  You end up bloated.  Then it is very easy to rely on
those libs for EVERYTHING, rather thank actually thinking.
So you end up with the mindset of, for example, "if it's text it's XML".
You have to parse everything as XML, when simple parsers would be tons
faster and simpler and smaller.
Bloat is cause by feature creep at every layer, not just the app.
Youck.
