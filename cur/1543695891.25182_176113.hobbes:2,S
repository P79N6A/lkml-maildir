Nasty.

This takes us up to about 28 flags; we'll run out soon.
Probably it is time to split this into generic and private flags, as we did
with bh_state_bits.  The scope of the "private" section needs to be
defined: maybe "whoever created the queue"?
blk_dump_rq_flags() will need updating.  Probably change it to only decode
the "generic" flags, and print "bit XX" for the remainders.
Your patch forgot to update rq_flags[] btw.
