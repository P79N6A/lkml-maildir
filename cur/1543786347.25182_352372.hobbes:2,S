I can't comment on the MMC layer or its core requirements as I don't
know them well. IDE PCMCIA does however encompass removal devices. The
removable flag is set so that we get removable media behaviour - that is
the media can change under us and we must not cache partition data. The
current behavioiur in that sense is correct.

But does MMC have a media change detect, and if not does the right thing
occur if you swap cards with partition tables ?

ATA standards are all available for download.

It might be currently because the old IDE layer has no hotplug support
(not even for PCMCIA - it happens to work some days) but that wasn't
true in 2.4-ac or some 2.6-ac.
It sounds like something needs to be smarter about whether the media has
changed - could be kernel but it seems like a user space problem. I note
that the standard Gnome tools "just work" in this case so perhaps you
can see how they do it.
