If IPSEC takes a long time to resolve, and we don't block, the
connect() can hard fail (we will just keep dropping the outgoing SYN
packet send attempts, eventually hitting the retry limit) in cases
where if we did block it would not fail (because we wouldn't send
the first SYN until IPSEC resolved).
