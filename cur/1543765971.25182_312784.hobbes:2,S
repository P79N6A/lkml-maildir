You mean like `ls` and `init` ??? Sure. I don't think any serious
embedded stuff would use that, though. Typically an embedded
system would start with a new application called 'init'. It
wouldn't use a SYS-V startup and certainly wouldn't have a shell.
The new init would do everything including mounting any file-
systems and initializing networking all by itself without
any help from the usual applications. It might fork-off a few
different tasks to handle different things. For instance,
the system shown probably handles the furnace and air-conditioner
as a separate task. The shades and blinds are probably another
and, certainly, communicating with the robot that mows the lawn
would require a separate task just to handle GPS.

Yep.
