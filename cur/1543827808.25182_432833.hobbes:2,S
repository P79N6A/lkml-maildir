   right now, we are working on this one. However, I spotted one 
statement in coding style
GLOBAL variables (to be used only if you _really_ need them) need to
have descriptive names, as do global functions.  If you have a function
that counts the number of active users, you should call that
"count_active_users()" or similar, you should _not_ call it "cntusr()".
  we used global variables in our codes to make coding easier. For 
example, we placed some variable on stack so that spaces are 
automatically allocated once our driver is loaded into memory and it is 
also automatically deallocated once our driver is unloaded. Thus, we 
don't have to consider WHAT IF situations in our codes. Of course, we 
can use dynamically allocated kernel memory but it just makes our codes 
a little complex.
  My question is -- could we use global variables if they are NOT 
absolutely necessary?
thank you,
