OK, I will do intensive tests this week-end, I have time. I just want to have some confirmations:
1. Is it still usefull to get all the backtraces of the last xfs oops ?
2. I will test patch-slab and patch-xfs on test11, CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC (only). Test on XFS root and ext3 with "small" and "big" kernels.
3. What about patch-bio of Manfred ? I didn't have much time to try it yet but seems to stabilize too. Should I use it alone or with the others patchs ?
Thanks all for your help
