I use a script to send any patches I care much about, rather than my
email client.  The script sends the file directly to my SMTP server.
Especially when sending more than one related patch, I find it much more
accurate to prepare the small text file indicating To, Cc, Bcc, Subject,
local-patch-pathname for each patch in the set at my leisure, in my text
editor, until it all looks right, then issue a single command to send it
all off.
Email clients, especially the gui ones I'm fond of, are not well
suited to such work.
There are various such 'patch-bomb' scripts out there - mine is
available at:

See the embedded Usage string for documentation.
The script checks out everything it can, including file paths and email
addresses (by verifying them with the SMTP server) before it sends
anything, further increasing the chance that if something is sent, it's
all sent and correctly so.
