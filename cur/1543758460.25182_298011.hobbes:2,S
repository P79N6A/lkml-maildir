Here's my version of the poll changes. The EPIPE one is just your original 
first patch hunk (with a properly updated commit message).

#   Make pipe "poll()" take direction of pipe into account.
#   
#   The pipe code has traditionally not cared about which end-point of the
#   pipe you are polling, meaning that if you poll the write-only end of a
#   pipe, it will still set the "this pipe is readable" bits if there is
#   data to be read on the read side.
#   
#   That makes no sense, and together with the new bigger buffers breaks
#   python-twisted.
#   
#   Based on debugging/patch by Andrea Arcangeli and testcase from
#   Thomas Crhak
