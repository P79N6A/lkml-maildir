In linux-2.4.18 and before, one can check for an input keystroke
by setting up a signal handler and acting upon that signal.
A snippet of code follows: 
/*-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-*/
/*
 *  Save terminal characteristics and then set the terminal for raw
 *  input generating a signal upon any received character.
 */ 
    if(tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &term) == FAIL)
        ERRORS(Tcgetattr);
    save = term;
    term.c_lflag = ISIG;
    term.c_iflag = 0;
    if(tcsetattr(STDIN_FILENO, TCSANOW, &term) == FAIL)
        ERRORS(Tcsetattr);
    if((flags = fcntl(STDIN_FILENO, F_GETFL)) == FAIL)
        ERRORS(Fcntl);
    flags |= (FNDELAY|FASYNC);
    if(fcntl(STDIN_FILENO, F_SETFL, flags) == FAIL)
        ERRORS(Fcntl);
    if(fcntl(STDIN_FILENO, F_SETOWN, getpid()) == FAIL)
        ERRORS(Fcntl);
In Linux-2.4.19, a signal is generated on OUTPUT as well as
input when STDIN_FILENO is associated with the network through
a virtual terminal 'pty' (like telnet).
This is NotGood(tm). Before I make work-arounds in production
code, is this a new standard or is it a bug? If this is a new
'standard', then the signal should be generated upon output
to all I/O terminal devices (which it isn't).
If somebody has a patch, I can easily check the fix.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
