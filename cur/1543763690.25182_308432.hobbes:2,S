It still makes sense to use a negative window bits for JFFS since it
means that you don't have to calculate the adler checksum in the
first place AND you don't have to store the zlib header/trailer on
disk.
BTW, that hack can only be applied when there is no preset dictionary.
Although the Linux implementation of JFFS probably never used a preset
dictionary, it is theoretically possible that someone out there may
have generated a JFFS image which contains a compressed stream that has
a preset dictionary.
In that case if you don't set the window bits to a postive value it
won't work at all.

Yes since the the window bits determines the compression quality and
the amount of memory used.  This is going to differ depending on the
application.

Each crypto/deflate user gets their own private zlib instance.
Where is the problem?
