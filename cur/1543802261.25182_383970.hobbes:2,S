OK, understood, my appologies.

OK (BTW: These were just patches to the open source wrapper of the binary 
drivers, which has to be GPL, since it's a deriver work - at least to my 
knowlege, though IANAL, so there should be no part of a proprietary code.)

OK, sorry, won't do that again.
(I did so only because not long ago there were some postings here from 
people unable to compile it with 2.6.15 kernels, so now that I was forced 
to patch it (for various irrelevant reasons) I thought someone else may 
want to try it as well. But, OK, wouldn't post it again, no problem.)
