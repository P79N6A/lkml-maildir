Rusty, 
I updated mm4 with the patch you sent in response to my shutdown oops 
report and haven't received a repeat oops in six reboots.  Hopefully this 
cures my problem.  I previously couldn't reproduce the oops every single 
reboot.  
I do have a couple of other anomalies to report though.
First is this snippet from my bootup log:
Cannot open master raw device '/dev/rawctl' (No such device)
/: clean, 192622/1196032 files, 969619/2390842 blocks
                                                           [  OK  ]
cat: /sys//devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:07.2/usb1/bNumConfigurations: No 
such file or directory
/etc/hotplug/usb.agent: line 144: [: too many arguments
Remounting root filesystem in read-write mode:             [  OK  ]
Activating swap partitions:                                [  OK  ]
Finding module dependencies:                               [  OK  ]
Second is that I receive the following error while compiling mm4:
Kernel: arch/i386/boot/bzImage is ready
sh /usr/local/kernel/linux-2.6.0/arch/i386/boot/install.sh 2.6.1-mm4a
