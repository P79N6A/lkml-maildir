a question. I tried to copy a reasonable large file to a jazdisk from cdrom.
this file, approx 570 MB insize can't be copied by linux.
'cp' reports :
avseq01.dat: file: read failed (Input/output error).
and the messages in the logs :

I ftp'd the file from another computer running windows to my system and
then, the file was OK of course. FWIW, it's :
/mnt/AVSEQ01.DAT: RIFF (little-endian) data
also note that the windows computer als contains linux kernel 2.2.13 and is
not able to read the data either. so under windows it can read the file,
under linux, it can't. 
did I do something elementary wrong or is it a bug ?
