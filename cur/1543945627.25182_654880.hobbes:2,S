Is anybody else having trouble compiling the kernel with binutils 2.17?
The build does this:

Still trying to track down why, but it works on a toolchain built from 
binutils 2.18 and gcc 4.1.3, but not with a toolchain from binutils 2.17 and 
gcc 4.1.2.  And considering where it's failing...
If binutils 2.18 is the only version that now builds the kernel, could we 
update Documentaiton/Changes to say that instead of 2.12?
