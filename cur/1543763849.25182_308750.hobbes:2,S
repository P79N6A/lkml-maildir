At least a 32 bit integer is guaranteed to stay an 32 bit integer 
(should one be required)
though multiple incarnations of the compiler.

When used improperly. The #define Al Viro objected to, is 
objectionable. It's highly
misleading, as Mr. Viro pointed out. I fail to see where he made 
comments on stdint.h
as such.

Apart from the integer having 32 bits?

Ok. I can live with that.
