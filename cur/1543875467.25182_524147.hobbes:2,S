Attached is a dmesg output with CONFIG_USB_DEBUG and CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND
enabled.
There are no messages from the iPod because, well, nothing happens when
I plug it in. I tried it 3 times. The strange thing is: when I trigger
a suspend or shutdown, then the "Do not disconnect" message shows up on
the iPod, which means that the computer regognized it as a storage
device.
