I have implemented a memory defragmentation utility for linux kernel 2.6 
based on the paper by Mr. Daniel Phillips.
Can this utility be used instead of bigphysarea patch for requirements less 
than MAX_ORDER of allocation ?
Can the people using bigphysarea patch kindly provide me with their 
respective memory requirements.
Pushkar.
