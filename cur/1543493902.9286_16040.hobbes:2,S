It is not impossible (although time consuming) to manually recover your
partitions. I had a problem with a Linux 2.0.30 box a while back (when
2.0.30 was the latest and greatest) and I had lost my partition table,
had no backup,and only a vague idea what the grometries should be. What
I found is that if you have a rescue disk, you can start with the first
partition, and guess. Then either mount it read-only and cat/cp every
file to /dev/null to check for errors or e2fsck -f -n; if you get
errors, try again. :)
Not very fun, but it is useful at (desprate) times.
