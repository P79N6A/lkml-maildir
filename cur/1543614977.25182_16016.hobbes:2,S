After having done some test using hi-tech istruments ( moving my mouse
during a kernel build ) i'd say that timeslice ~= 40ms + mm affinity bonus
set to 1 is _way_ better from a system interactive point of view. A lower
timeslice will also result in a more uniform distribution of dynamics
priorities.
