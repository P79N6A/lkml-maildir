Greetings all;
I may have found a gotcha in the 2.6.16.1 and NDI how far back it goes 
because I haven't used anything ieee1394 in months.
Anyway, I plugged in my camera, a Sony DCR-TVR460 and fired up kino, 
fully expecting to see the viewfinders image on screen as soon as I 
switched kino to the capture screen.
Unforch, its blank and kino is locked up, needing kde's emergency kill 
the process to kill it when I click on the closing x.
From the logs, I get this is 4 or 5 lines.
Mar 31 17:30:16 coyote ieee1394.agent[8925]: ... no drivers for IEEE1394 
product 0x/0x/0x
Mar 31 17:30:16 coyote ieee1394.agent[8921]: ... no drivers for IEEE1394 
product 0x/0x/0x
Mar 31 17:30:16 coyote kernel: ieee1394: raw1394: /dev/raw1394 device 
initialized
And about 6 or 7 lines of gconf verbosy later, this:
Mar 31 17:31:28 coyote kernel: ohci1394: fw-host0: Waking dma ctx=0 ... 
processing is probably too slow
then:
[root@coyote linux-2.6.16.1]# lsmod |grep 1394
raw1394                24172  0
dv1394                 16716  0
ohci1394               27824  1 dv1394
ieee1394               82488  3 raw1394,dv1394,ohci1394
And:
[root@coyote linux-2.6.16.1]# 
ls /lib/modules/2.6.16.1/kernel/drivers/ieee1394
dv1394.ko  ieee1394.ko  ohci1394.ko  raw1394.ko  sbp2.ko  video1394.ko
sbp2.ko isn't needed, its for a webcam thats a POS.  I should quit 
building it altogether.
modprobe video1394 inserts that module, but makes zilch difference.
kino still freezes the instant the capture button is clicked.
Unplugging the firewire cable from the camera is silent in messages, but 
dmesg says:
ieee1394: Node changed: 0-01:1023 -> 0-00:1023
ieee1394: Node suspended: ID:BUS[0-00:1023]  GUID[08004601044684e4]

Then from:

And I'm not smart enough for anything there to raise a flag.
So obviously something's gone aglay, but what?
The last time I ran this config to do some movie editing of a wedding, 
along about June of last year, it all Just Worked. And I recently did 
some much needed housekeeping, such that if I wanted to build a 2.6.14 
kernel, I'd have to go get the tarball & start from scratch.
Ideas anybody?
