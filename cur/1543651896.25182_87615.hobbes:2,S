Yes, but not the IDE code (I have know idea what IDE defaults to). If you
have sg its proc interface can dump them, but AIC should default to 253,
on my system with AIC adapter (not the aic7xxx_old adapter, it looks like
it defaults to 32) I typically see:
cat /proc/scsi/sg/device_hdr /proc/scsi/sg/devices
host    chan    id      lun     type    opens   qdepth  busy    online
0       0       0       0       0       2       253     0       1
0       0       1       0       0       1       253     0       1
0       0       15      0       3       0       2       0       1
The last device does not support tcq (id 15), so it gets a depth of 2.
The AIC driver also prints the depth on init/boot like so:
	scsi0:A:0:0: Tagged Queuing enabled.  Depth 253
My .config has (default cmd per device):
CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX=y
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_CMDS_PER_DEVICE=253
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_RESET_DELAY_MS=15000
