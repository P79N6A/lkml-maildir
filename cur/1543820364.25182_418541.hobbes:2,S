hm.  This needs some care and thought.  We _should_ be oopsing all over the
place because of this.  So why aren't we?
iirc, the cpu notifier chain is never used after bootup if
!CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU, so there's a good chance that we have things on that
list which have been unloaded, but which never get accessed.
It could be similar with the __devinit things - they're on the list,
they're unloaded, but nothing ever happens in a !CONFIG_HOTPLUG kernel to
cause them to be dereferenced.
Really, these notifier chains just shouldn't exist at all if they're not
going to be used.  We're a bit sloppy here.  Ashok and I spent some time
working on making lots of code and data structures go away if
!CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU, but it's a bit tricky due to the way we do SMP
bringup.
I guess for now, bringing those things into .text and .data when there's
doubt is a reasonable thing to do.

It's x86-only I think.  If all architectures use the same symbols then I
guess we could do an arch-neutral version, but one should check.
If it won't work on all architectures then kernel/sys.c isn't the right
place for it.
Maybe it's not so useful.  If we're actually accessing these things then
someone should report oopses.  So this debugging infrastructure will only
detect things which a) are in __init, b) shouldn't be in __init and c) are
never actually accessed.
So I'd be inclined to not bother about this for now.
