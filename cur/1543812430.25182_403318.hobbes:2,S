Subject: [-mm PATCH] time: reduced ntp rework part 2 - remove duplicate leapsecond code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hey Andrew,
	Just wanted to sync up with you before I do a B20 release of the TOD
code. 
The reduced ntp rework patch part 2 adds a new ntp_leapsecond() which
should replace the existing leapsecond processing. However somehow the
chunk which removes the old code got dropped. Probably my fault.
Without this patch, its possible the leapsecond TIME_OOP state would not
be set for the second following a insertion.
thanks
