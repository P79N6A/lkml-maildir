The only uses of threads in a full aio application is task independence
(or interactivity) and process context separation
Example from GUI side:
Suppose your web (http) client is fully ported to aio (thus only one
thread), if you have two windows and one window receives a big
complicated html page that needs much CPU time to render, this window
can block the other one. If you have a thread for each window, once the
html parser has elapsed its timeslice, the other window can continue
parsing or displaying its (tiny html) page.
(In fact you should use two (or more) threads per window, as html parsing
shouldn't block widget redrawing (like menus and toolbars))
