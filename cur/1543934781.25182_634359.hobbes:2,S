Not on architectures that implement WARN_ON() with the help of lib/bug.c and
an invalid opcode. Your out of line helper function doesn't get called there.
Instead the exception handler calls report_bug() which in turn prints the
warning message, then calls show_regs() and returns BUG_TRAP_TYPE_WARN.
Afterwards the instruction pointer is incremented and execution continues.
This is true for powerpc, avr32, sh, parisc and s390.
Your out of line changes don't have any effect on these architectures.
Dunno.. maybe you are aware of this. Just wanted to make sure we aren't
talking of totally different things.

Not on all architectures.. see above :)

Yes, of course. Also I like the WARN_ON() with exception semantics much more
since it gives the ability to print the register contents etc. So you get
much more debug informations.

Not really... lib/bug.c handles both if the architecture wants it. It just
needs to set BUGFLAG_WARNING in the bug table entries for warnings.
