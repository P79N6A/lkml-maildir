You would not even be able to recongnize it; we're talking about  
displaying text faster than the refresh rate, as pavel mentioned  
earlier:

On the other hand, making the text console much more efficient would  
save a some CPU for *other* processes, say the one that's outputting  
text at such a high rate of speed, so it's probably worth it if it's  
not too hard.
