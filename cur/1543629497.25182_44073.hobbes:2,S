Sure I just did it in one go with the rest of DMA handling changes.
I just wan'ted to get over with this.

Sure it sucks. The most sucks the fact that the trasnfer functions
should be folded in the generic context functions. I know.
I have choosen the udma prefix becouse ata_udma wouldn't contain much more
information and just stayed consistant with it for the tcq stuff as well.
Now one can at least understand the work flow of the DMA stuff I think
so cleaning it firther should be easier now.
Please consided it all as a step in between and after reading 54 you should
see where it's going...
