SysRq works, but the screen seems to be frozen (i.e. not updated), I've
got no seriell console at hand, will try booting without framebuffer
later.
As suggested by Olaf Hering I've checked init/main.c. It says
| 161:	if (sys_access("/init", 0) == 0)
| 162:		execute_command = "/init";
| 163:	else
| 164:		prepare_namespace();
thus I think, that the sources should be o.k. I've also rebuild the
kernel using a `make clean` first.
my .config should be attached.
