Just the other day you posted strong opposition to breaking existing
binaries, how does that map with breaking existing hardware?

That's clearly true, but part of the reason is that some drivers just
don't compile, so people assume it's a work in progress. And when problems
are reported they sometimes don't get fixed even when there is a
maintainer listed for a driver. Hopefully vendors will pick up the slack
for things like that and the power management issues.
