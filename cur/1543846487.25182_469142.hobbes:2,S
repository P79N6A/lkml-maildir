Even assuming ld.so would be hacked up so that it parses /proc/mounts
to see if you are trying to run an executable via ld.so from
noexec mount (which isn't going to happen), if mmap with PROT_EXEC
is allowed on noexec mounts, you can always put there a shared
library instead of a binary and put some interesting stuff in its
constructors and then just LD_PRELOAD=/dev/shm/libmyhack.so /bin/true
Really, if noexec is supposed to make any sense at all, it needs
to prevent PROT_EXEC mapping/mprotect, otherwise it is completely
useless.
