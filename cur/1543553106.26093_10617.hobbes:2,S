Pavel,  The optimization exploits the multiple piplines in Intel's
processors,
and yes, it does execute more than one instruction per clock, it's
optimized
to execute in the processors parallel pipelines.  The EMON numbers are
accurate,
and you can download the kernel and verify for yourself.  These types of
optimizations
are possible when people have acccess to Intel Red Cover documents, then
you 
get to know just how Intel's internal architectures are affected by 
different coding optimizations.
