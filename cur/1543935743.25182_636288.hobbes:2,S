It displays just the right time. On boot anyway. (Linux has had some
serious problems keeping the time after the switch from 2.6.7 to 2.6.14,
advanding even 15 minutes a day -- that ntpd doesn't seem to be able 
to keep up with -- requiring running adjtimexconfig every now and
then for new settings. But the cmos clock displays the right time.)
