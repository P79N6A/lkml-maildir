I don't understand how anyone can possibly know that.
It's true that today very few users use security modules,
but the Linux kernel doesn't support loadable security modules
today, so it would be unreasonable to use today's figures to
estimate likely future usage.

Ahh, good.  Then you should be pretty happy with the current LSM
framework.  I believe that users who don't load a LSM module won't
notice anything.  For example, the LSM folks have several performance
measurements that show that the performance overhead of LSM is basically
negligible, so that's one way that users won't notice it is there.
