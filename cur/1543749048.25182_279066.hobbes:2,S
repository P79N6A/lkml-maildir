Not sure about this. I think such types should be defined by the
kernel, for it's use only. The libc (and any other userspace
software) may probably use them (if they have to), but must not
(re)define them.
The userspace should probably best use standard types. This is
userspace to know if their uint32_t has standard meaning equivalent
to __u32 or if it's actually a function name.
So i think we should have:
kernel-include/headers.h:
#define __u32 ...
struct some_structure {
       __u32 var;
}str1;
and then userspace.c (libc et al) should:
#include linux/headers.h
str1 v;
uint32_t variable = v.var;
or maybe with some type conversion:
long long v2 = v.var;
unsigned char v3 = v.var;
