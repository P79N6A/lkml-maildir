I don't know what or why, but I am experiancing a nightmare with 
interactivity and heavy nfs use.   I am using Gentoo, and I have my 
portage tree exported from a central server.   Trying to do an emerge 
update world is taking forever.
During the time it is scanning the portage tree it takes 2 - 3 minutes 
to load Firefox.   It also took almost 5 minuts to load GAIM.  Once GAIM 
loaded, none of the screens would paint.  I halted the emerge and 
instantly Gaim painted and all the web pages I was waiting for in 
firefox finished.   So I unleashed emerge again, and tried to load more 
local-only apps.  Same problem.  Horrible delays. Halt emerge, and boom, 
everything snappy and fast.
So, as long as I don't use NFS, this is spectacular, but NFS access is 
murdering me.
In any case, I would take from recommendations.  For testing, etc.  I am 
on the list, but if there is testing, please CC my address.
