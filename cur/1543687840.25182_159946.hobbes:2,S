Hi,
I've been talking to someone who has good support for his
SII680 disk controller in 2.4 but he can't get it working
in 2.6.
Is this chip supported yet in 2.6?  I see the chip mentioned
in Andre's code in siimage.h, but apparently this fellow's
dmesg doesn't say anything about the chip being found at boot.
