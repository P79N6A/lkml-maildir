Subject: How getting a pointer on the per-cpu struct tss_struct??

Hello,
may anyone tell me where I'm wrong???
What I thought to have found:
I want to access the per-cpu IO Permission Bitmap. Therefore, I try to
get a pointer on the per-cpu struct tss_struct. I found an array of typ
'struct tss_struct' named 'init_tss' (declared in asm/processor.h with
'DECLARE_PER_CPU(struct tss_struct, init_tss);').
So I should be able to get a pointer on the struct tss_struct of the
current cpu, by using the following code:
	int cpu = get_cpu();
	struct tss_struct * t = &per_cpu(init_tss, cpu);
But when I try to compile this, I get the warning:
	*** Warning: "per_cpu__init_tss" [/home/..../module.ko]
	undefined!
and according to this warning an error, when I try to load the module:
	insmod: error inserting 'module.ko': -1 Unknown symbol in module
(I'm using gcc4.0.2 and kernel 2.6.14.2)
Where's my problem??
Thanks,
Marko Euth
