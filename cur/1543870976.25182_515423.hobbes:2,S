Subject: [PATCH 03/13] fs/unionfs/: Don't grab dentry private data mutex in unionfs_d_release
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/4/216

Grabbing the UNIONFS_D(dentry)->lock is completely unnecessary and there are
no other references; we are about to free the object anyway. Additionally,
grabbing the mutex produces warning when the slab object is reused - as it
was freed while there still was a reference to it.
