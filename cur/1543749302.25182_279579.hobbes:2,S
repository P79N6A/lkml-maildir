I don't know if you've been following, but it was recently discoverd that on
smp, if multiple processes read from /dev/urandom at the same time, they can
get the same data.  Theodore Tytso posted a patch to fix this for 2.6, and
someone else told me this problem has existed all the way back to 1.3.
This is a security issue, and should be included in the 2.4 tree.
