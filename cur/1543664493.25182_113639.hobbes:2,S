No space.  At times Unix is just as fussy as IBM JCL :)   
Agreed on the value of `noatime`.  It made a huge difference 
in responsiveness on an old 486sx25 laptop.

Agreed.  But on some mobos, it doesn't matter.  Then I prefer the
furthest slot from the RAM controller.  Sure, signal time-of-flight
is a few ps longer, but at least the bus is terminated and will
have fewer reflections.

Yes.  Reseating will creat new electrical connections.
