This might give the Kconfig guys a headache, but maybe a middle road would be 
to make selects turn on options rather than force them on. That is, make it 
so that if SUSPEND depends on SWAP, and selects it, after enabling SUSPEND, 
SWAP is also enabled, but you can still go to SWAP and turn it off, thereby 
also disabling SUSPEND again?
