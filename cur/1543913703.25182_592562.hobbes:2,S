Adrian,
as much as I personally disagree with Andrew's policy here (esp for
these symbols, they have been deprecated for years now), it's trivial
to just follow his requirements and get this over with.
As for who cares.. I do care still, unused exports make the kernel
bigger for everyone, and for the most cases, encourage incorrect APIs
to be used by driver writers (they act as a trap; the symbols generally
are not used by anything in the kernel because they're the wrong API to
use for drivers; having them exported wrongly suggests to new driver
writers that they are good things to use). I plan to do another run of
finding all unused exports and just marking the lot as _UNUSED  exports.
(that's not the same as removing them quite yet, but at least it's a
good warning for driver writers that they should think twice about the
API to see if it's the right one to use)
