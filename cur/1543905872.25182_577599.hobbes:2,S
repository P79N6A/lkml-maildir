Subject: [PATCH 00/14] Permit filesystem local caching
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/31/459

These patches add local caching for network filesystems such as NFS and AFS.
This is a preview, so expect bugs.
FS-Cache now runs fully asynchronously as required by Trond Myklebust for NFS.

A tarball of the patches is available at:

+fscache-20.tar.bz2
To use this version of CacheFiles, the cachefilesd-0.8 is also required.  It
is available as an SRPM:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/fscache/cachefilesd-0.8-15.fc7.src.rpm
Or as individual bits:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/fscache/cachefilesd-0.8.tar.bz2
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/fscache/cachefilesd.fc
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/fscache/cachefilesd.if
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/fscache/cachefilesd.te
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/fscache/cachefilesd.spec
The .fc, .if and .te files are for manipulating SELinux.
