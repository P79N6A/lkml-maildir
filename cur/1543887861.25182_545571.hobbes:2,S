Actually, it cannot be a problem with the 4*2.75T arrangement.
  chuck << chunksize_bits
will not exceed the size of the underlying device *in*kilobytes*.
In that case that is 0xAE9EC800 which will git in a 32bit long.
We don't double it to make sectors until after we add
zone->dev_offset, which is "sector_t" and so 64bit arithmetic is used.
So I'm quite certain this bug will cause exactly the problems
experienced!!

Don't bother about the other tests I mentioned, just try this one.
Thanks.
