my testing of this patch has revealed an issue along these lines.  building 
mplayer fails as it uses linux/dvb/audio.h.  this header does:
#ifdef __KERNEL__
#include <linux/types.h>
#else
#include <stdint.h>
#endif
typedef uint16_t audio_attributes_t;
but since the script has autoconverted uint16_t to __u16, and linux/types.h 
isnt being pulled in for userspace, we get a build failure.
