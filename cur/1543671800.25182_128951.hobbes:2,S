Just as a note (I know its not an excuse), Red Hat 9 has Open Office
with the dumb sched_yield() calls removed.  It runs quite nice.

Well, his base O(1) scheduler does not have 2.5's sched_yield()... but
he has a patch (I guess that he wrote) on top which changes the
semantics a bit.  It looks like he drops the task one priority level
each call, but if it is ever to-be-moved to a queue all by its lonesome,
the task is put on the expired array instead.
Also, he has a check at the start that, if it is in a queue all by
itself (even before it is moved) the call just returns.
Not sure what all these changes add up to...
