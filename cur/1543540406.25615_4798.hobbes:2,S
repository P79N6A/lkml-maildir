Get the full manuals for the chipsets. There are lots of features you can
control (streaming, peer concurrency, prefetch etc) and on quite a few chipsets
you have to turn some of them off to make it work.

Triton has bugs, VIA have bugs,  SIS have bugs, everyone has bugs

Wrong.
Some examples
o	SIS 486 chipsets. PCI dma to another PCI target directly doesnt work
o	VIA VP* PCI/ISA bridge gets ISA bus mastering DMA disable wrong and
	locks the board
o	Triton you have to turn off streaming and peer concurrency for some
	configurations 
There is a reason we have pci-quirks.c
