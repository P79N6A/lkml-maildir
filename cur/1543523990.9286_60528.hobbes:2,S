Cool, I was unaware that such a system existed! Sounds like just the
thing we need. You don't always need to fire up the audio device when
a CD is played, I frequently just use head phones plugged into the
front of the drive.

Sure, we might as well stick with the event based system.

Lets not talk IDE, but CD-ROM instead. All volume requests and CD
play operations go through the uniform CD-ROM layer. A drive
can fail the volume request naturally, if it doesn't support it.
At probe time we also detect whether the drive does support CD
audio. Why would you need the specific volume? If there's some
kind of output, fire up the audio device. Some CD drives don't
even support a range of volumes, just on/off.
