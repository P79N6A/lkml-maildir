I think this should be changed:
I also have CFLAGS set on some computers in my environments since for 
packages using GNU autoconf that's the correct way to set the compiler 
flags.
The kernel already sets all flags correctly, and a user wanting to 
change the flags for the kernel is an exception with very special needs
(I'd even claim so special that he could simply edit the Makefile...).
Using the *FLAGS automatically in the kernel doesn't sound right, can we 
prefix all environment variables the kernel honours with KERNEL_ ?
