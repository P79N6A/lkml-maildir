Yes but (is copy to/from user size limited?) whats the cahes size
compared to the copy operation preformed compared to lost useful
cachelines =)

Yeah i know, but i was thinking more of a compromize, then it might be
better...

Thats good to know, since i have wondered for a while why block io seems
so oddly slow...
I just thought that there might be some good compromize between the two
that would make it automatic.
Oh well, guess i'm back to coughing and waiting for patches to be
implemented =)
