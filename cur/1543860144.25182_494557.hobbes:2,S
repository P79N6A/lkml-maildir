It crashed again, but this time with no output (machine locked solid). To be 
honest, the disassembly looks right (it's like Chuck said, it's jumping back 
half way through an instruction):
c0156f5f:       3b 87 68 01 00 00       cmp    0x168(%edi),%eax
So c0156f60 is 87 68 01 00 00..
This is with the GCC recompile, so it's not a distro problem. It could still 
either be GCC 4.x, or a 2.6.19.1 specific bug, but it's serious. 2.6.19 with 
GCC 3.4.3 is 100% stable.
