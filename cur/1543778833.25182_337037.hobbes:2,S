Subject: [PATCH] fix normalize problem in posix timers.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

We found this (after a customer complained) and it is in the kernel.org 
kernel.  Seems that for CLOCK_MONOTONIC absolute timers and 
clock_nanosleep calls both the request time and wall_to_monotonic are 
subtracted prior to the normalize resulting in an overflow in the 
existing normalize test.  This causes the result to be shifted ~4 
seconds ahead instead of ~2 seconds back in time.  Patch is attached.

Type: Defect Fix 
Description:
	The normalize code in posix-timers.c fails when the tv_nsec 
	member is ~1.2 seconds negative.  This can happen on absolute
	timers (and clock_nanosleeps) requested on CLOCK_MONOTONIC
	(both the request time and wall_to_monotonic are subtracted
	resulting in the possibility of a number close to -2 seconds.)
	This fix uses the set_normalized_timespec() (which does not 
	have an overflow problem) to fix the problem and as a side
	effect makes the code cleaner.
