This is quite strange because for me the card works on resume, I
have the driver compiled in, but that should make no difference.
Could you try to plug/unplug the cable and see if it detects media
changes ? Messages like "Media link on/off" should appear.
Also, since probably the problem is that the mac filter is not reset
correctly, could you try tcpdump and see if in promiscous mode it
receives something ?
Thanks.
