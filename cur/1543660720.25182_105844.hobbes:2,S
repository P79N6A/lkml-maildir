The problem is random in nature it occurs on its own
giving dma error at boot time when it is checks the
hard disk.
hda: dma_intr: bad DMA status (dma_stat=35) ;
hda: dma_intr: status=0x50 { DriveReady SeekComplete }
hda: dma_intr: bad DMA status (dma_stat=35)  
hda: dma_intr: status=0x50 { DriveReady SeekComplete }
hda: dma_intr: bad DMA status (dma_stat=75)
The hexadecimal values of the status are different.
I have attched the dmesg and the lspci output also.
