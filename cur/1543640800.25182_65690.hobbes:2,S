I'd rather not, because most of the architectures just need the
generic version.  I *hate* unnecessarily duplicated code.

I thought about that, but couldn't work out any way to make it appear
in the right place in the menus --- it's really a block device
configuration option that happens to be needed only for a few
architectures.

Will do...
