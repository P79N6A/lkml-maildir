hi,
a couple of things to check here.
a) when compiling the kernel, did you remember to select the proper CPU in
the kernel config?
b) if you are using (for example) an ATI Rage 128 you need to go into
character devices and say Y to DRI X and ATI Rage 128.
(I found that the latter idea fixed the same problem on my machine.)
I'm a newbie, 12, so hope this helps!
