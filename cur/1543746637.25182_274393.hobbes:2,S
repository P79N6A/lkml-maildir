I've been looking over my patches again (and still doing so), and I must 
say that I feel quite comfortable with my changes related to padzero() - I 
think at least that bit could go into -mm for now. I'm also quite certain 
my change to fill_psinfo() is safe (although I know you consider it a 
silly fix), that could probably also safely go into -mm. The rest of the 
changes have not caused me any trouble, but I don't have as warm and fuzzy 
a feeling in my belly about those as I do about the padzero() and 
fill_psinfo() changes, so the rest should probably wait a bit unless your 
reading of them tells you they are correct - I'll keep 
digging/reading/learning and see if I can either confirm the rest is OK or 
find the proper solution, but that could take a while...
