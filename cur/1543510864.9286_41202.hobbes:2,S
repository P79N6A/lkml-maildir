This has bugged me before, too, when porting code to my Alpha.
It comes from the Linux kernel includes <asm/posix_types.h> and
<linux/types.h>.  Personally I think it's a mistake in the kernel
definitions, to be different C data types across architectures.  It's fine
for the sizes of a native type to differ; if "long" is a different number
of bytes or byte-order on some other architecture.  But when the data types
themselves are different in the headers, you have problems when using
abstract data types (eg. size_t).  Effectively it's like saying that foo()
takes an int on x86 and a long on Alpha (or Sparc64, or PPC, or ...).  IMO
it would be most proper if size_t were defined as unsigned long on all
architectures.
