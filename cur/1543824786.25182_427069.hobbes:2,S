I agree that just moving the code does not help. But my code actually
loads a new set of gdts and idts and I'm hoping that it will improve
the robustness.
Regarding more comments I totally agree with you.

But I need to store my page tables somewhere, and there is no good
place to store them now. With good reasoning I can be convinced that
storing things on the control page is a good thing, and I'd like to
agree on something, but without good reasoning I will continue to
think that the control page solution is overly complex.
