Uhm, it *is* documented:
In include/scsi/sg.h, line 255:
/* maximum outstanding requests, write() yields EDOM if exceeded */
#define SG_MAX_QUEUE 16
SG_MAX_QUEUE has nothing to do with inquiry length but with the maximum
number of queued commands (hence the name SG_MAX_QUEUE).
I'm sorry, but I think Jens found a genuine bug in your program. IMHO
it would increase your credits on this list if you admit it and fix the
bug. If you don't, we'll keep this kind of linux-vs-cdrecord threads on
lkml. That can't be the idea, cause we all just agreed that we wanted
to keep the amount noise on this list low.
BTW, you are right for the old SG implementations. Line 267 of
include/scsi/sg.h:
/* vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv */
/*   The older SG interface based on the 'sg_header' structure follows.   */
/* ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ */
#define SG_MAX_SENSE 16   /* this only applies to the sg_header interface */
You're free to use old and deprecated implementations but don't file
bugs against them cause they are old and deprecated for a reason.
Erik
