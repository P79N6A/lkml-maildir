Thanks.
Can you please resend with proper changelog and signed-off-by.
Diff should be done on top of latest -linus preferable.
Also this patch seems relative small compared to the others floating

Does this really fix all of them or only a subset of the warnings?
I do not have gcc4 present but maybe thats easy - running gentoo?

Can we have a local variable so we do not have all the casts in the if
condition?
