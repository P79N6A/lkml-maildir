I just upgraded from -mm3 (which I'd been running solidly for over a
week) to -mm8, and find that the system freezes hard after I start the X
server.  After X starts, lifetime varies from zero to maybe 20 seconds
of app launching, then everything locks up.
At this point, the machine is still pingable, but daemons like sshd
don't respond, and I can't see any logs.  After a reboot back to -mm3,
there's nothing suspicious in /var/log.
