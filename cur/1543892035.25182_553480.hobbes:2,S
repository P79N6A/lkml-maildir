I will remove the STATIC_ENABLE and the PRINTK, but I will leave the
CF_LOCKDEP and CF_OPTIMIZED there: they are required to let the generic
version be selected in contexts where a breakpoint cannot be used on
x86 (especially when placing a cond_call within lockdep.c code or any
code that could not afford to fall into a breakpoint handler).

Please see

for Jeremy Fitzhardinge's comment on the issue. I will add some comments
in the code.
