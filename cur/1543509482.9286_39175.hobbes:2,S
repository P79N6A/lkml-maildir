Make mrproper did its job.  Good suggestion!  The kernel is up
and running, with only some minor issues:
  - depmod warned about unresolved in wan_pipe.o.  I have
    experimental disabled, so this is OK
  - The rpc.nfsd warning about "nfssvc function not implemented"
thx for the help

You have a mismatch between the running kernel and the modules.  It
normally indicates human error such as forgetting to install the new
kernel, forgetting to install the new modules, forgetting to update
lilo (or other boot loader) to point to the new kernel.
MEC has suggested that there might be a bug in the Makefiles when
changing from UP to SMP.  If so, the solution is -
save .config,
make mrproper,
restore .config,
make oldconfig,
make dep clean bzImage modules,
install new kernel and modules,
update boot loader,
reboot.
