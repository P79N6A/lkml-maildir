I also think this is racy.
CPU_0					CPU_1
hrtimer_wakeup:
	task = t->task;
	t->task = NULL;
	<--- INTERRUPT --->
					task is woken by signal,
					do_nanosleep() sees t->task == NULL,
					returns without hrtimer_cancel(),
					and __exits__.
	<--- RESUME --->
	wake_up_process(task);
Instead of exit(), 'task' can go to TASK_STOPPED or TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
after return from do_nanosleep(), it will be awakened by hrtimer_wakeup()
unexpectedly.
Oleg.
