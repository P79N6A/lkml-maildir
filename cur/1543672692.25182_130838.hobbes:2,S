I think assuming this is bad programming form.  You are assuming that
the memory allocator zeros out newly allocated memory.  Though your
assumption may be correct, it's always possible that this behavior will
change some day (perhaps for efficiency reasons), causing your code
to break.  In my opinion, the savings of a few cpu clock cycles that
you gain by omitting the initialization isn't worth compromising
the robustness of your code.
