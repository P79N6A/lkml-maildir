do these guys /ever/ plan on submitting kernel patches? i used to use
lm_sensors on 2.2 cause it was fairly painless - but just havn't
bothered with 2.4 cause it was a pita when i tried.
i know they talked AC at some point about getting a patch in, but
nothing seems to have come from it.
what a damm damm shame. we've got code that appears to work really
well[1] to drive most of the hardware sensors out there - but the
code is used by only a tiny fraction of linux users cause these guys
/apparently/ would much rather keep themselves and their code
isolated in some god forsaken CVS server rather than submit their
code to Linus.
fscking shame.
