I don't see it as replacement. But my experience is that not many people
will open their web servers for NFS or CODA access. DAV might be a different
thing as it's meant as replacement for the Frontpage Server Extensions.
Thus web page editing or editing of any other files (images, flash, etc.)
on a web server would be easier if done via this protocol.
The disadvantage with GNOME or KDE would be again that it's then
not available for every program.
best,
