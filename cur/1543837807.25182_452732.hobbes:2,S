Yes. And now I think dynamic growing is not a good solution, since user
can not know when he must call mmap() again to get additional pages
(although I have some hacks to "dynamically" replace previously mmapped
pages with new ones).
This area can be decreased down to 70mb by reducing amount of
information placed into the buffer (only user's data and flags) without
additional hints.
