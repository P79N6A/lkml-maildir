	Ok, so let me try to repeat what you just said, to clarify:
	a) UID <-> Capabilities for ``allowed'' capabilities for a UID
	b) SETUID on an inode to enable the capabilities
	c) The inode carries a mask that further restricts the the capabilities
	d) The executable can then drop capabilities from this final
	   mask. ie:
	UID 0x00FE -> Inode 0x0079 -> Executable drops 0x0040 -> 0x0031
	Correct?

	Now that type of fine grained control is kinda difficult for the
kernel (aestetically) to enforce... If capabilities need to be that
fine grained, then maybe (as I have heard discussed in this thread IIRC)
we should have a ``security service'' - a user-land daemon that gets
a RPC from the kernel on every capability influenced 
open/close/read/write/mount/etc.  to verify that the UID can perform
that action.
	Much more extensible, small amount of kernel work, and no in-kernel
policy. 
	Now, I've got to ask the list - ``If you were to design a Trusted
Linux System, how would you go about it?'' 
	Send concepts directly to me (jmcmullan@linuxcare.com) - let's keep that 
level of traffic off the list.  I'll collect all the replies I get, and 
generate a digest of the results, with pointers to the original emails
[unless, of course, you want to be anonymous]
	Submissions will be accepted until March 4, GMT 00:00 2000.
	Digest will be placed on the WWW at 
http://zhrodague.net/~jmcc/
by March 6, GMT 00:00 (barring flood, fire, or famine)
	I want to put all this into a FAQ format, so that we can point 
people to what's already been discussed next time this flamewar
erupts on linux-kernel. ;^)
[actually, it's been more of a slowly-burning-incense-stick war, but hey..]
