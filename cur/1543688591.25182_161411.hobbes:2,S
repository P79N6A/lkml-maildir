Interesting idea.  I pondered this for a while.  But even if you postulate 
a varargs version of printk (which doesn't exist), it's not really
feasible to do this in a function.  There's no way for a function to
prepend args to a va_list.  That means you'd have to encode the text of
the prefix as part of the format string, and that would require you to
allocate room for prefix+format, which is still a lot of stack.  Also,
the fact that the interface name itself may contain "%d" or some such
makes it even messier.
Greg K-H thinks #2 is a reasonable solution (you're about to serialize on printk's
lock anyway), so I'll go with that.
Thanks.
