Well... at least it lost the DMA which isn't good. But our driver tends
to be a bit nasty for that. We may probably want a smarter wakeup
sequence for ide-cd that the current one that does nothing (just use the
default IDE one which is to wait for BUSY to be gone). I suspect some
ATAPIs would love getting a new WIN_PIDENTIFY at least, and I've seen
some take time before actually _raising_ BUSY ... I'll look into it.
