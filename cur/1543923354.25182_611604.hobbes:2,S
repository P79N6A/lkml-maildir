It can't.

No.  It is precisely a test for being in a namespace.
We first check ns->level to make certain it doesn't fall out
of the array, and then we check to see if the namespace we
are looking for is at that level.
pid->numbers[0].ns == &init_pid_ns.

What we want for the test is a test for membership.

I don't have a problem with that.  The rest of the checks for
this in kernel/pid.c are in the same form.
