I built a SMP kernel earlier today (in order to enable hyperthreading),
and discovered that the lost interrupt problem appears to have gone
away.  In addition, dmesg no longer shows any "unexpected IO-APIC"
messages.  The only configuration changes from the previous kernel are:
   CONFIG_SMP=y
   CONFIG_ACPI=y
   CONFIG_ACPI_BUSMGR=y
   CONFIG_ACPI_CPU=y
I guess that the next step is to disable hyperthreading in the BIOS,
and see if the UP kernel still has problems.
