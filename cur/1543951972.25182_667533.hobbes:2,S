But I should see any kobjects being created and destroyed as you are
thinking that is the problem here, right?
And I don't see any, so I'm thinking that this is probably something

I'm still interested in why your machine was oopsing when bisecting
through the kobject commits.  I thought it all should have worked
without problems, as I spend enough time trying to ensure it was so...
