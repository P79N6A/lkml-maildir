After seeing this topic in the Kernel Cousin and reading through the mail
archives, I thought I'd mention a very useful feature that Linux could
steal^H^H^H^H^Hleverage from Solaris:  the coreadm(1) program allows users
to set a pattern for core file names, e.g.,
    /var/core/core.%f.%p
for command foo with pid 1234 dumps core in /var/core/core.foo.1234 (to
use the example from the coreadm man page).  There're about half a dozen
% patterns.
The root user can set patterns and policies systemwide (e.g., no coredumps
for regular users, dump all corefiles everywhere into a directory readable
only by root, etc, for security reasons).  Also, this pattern information
is stored per-process AFAICT, so in my login files I have
    coreadm -p core.%f.%p $$
Meaning that all core files go into the current directory.  It gets set
for the shell itself, and all the processes spawned from that shell.
Both as a user and a sysadmin, I've found this to be very very useful.
Anyhow, just a thought.  Thanks for reading.
Luck++;
Phil
