Hi,
I'm experiencing a rather odd behaviour with the character set conversion. If I
mount a vfat fs with utf8 and then create a file with invalid utf-8 sequences,
the file will briefly exist with these invalid sequences, then quickly convert
to a stripped version.
I haven't found an easy way to catch the race, but if I have nautilus open it
tends to catch it now and then (I get a file name with "<?>" replacing each bad
byte).
The race also seems to corrupt the in-memory state of the fs now and then. I
managed to create a file where "ls" shows "?" for most fields. Data seemed to
have made it to disk ok though (fsck didn't complain and a remount showed
everything as it should be).
Third, there seems to be a problem with not all syscalls being subjected to the
NLS transformation. Example:
$ echo foo > baråäö.txt
$ ls
foo.txt
$ echo foo > baråäö.txt
bash: baråäö.txt: File exists
Rgds
