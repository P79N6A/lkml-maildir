but then won't the devices get registered in a random order? (i.e. 
whenever the async portion finishes the probing and finds the details of 
what there is to register)

I'm not worried about notification to userspace, I'm worried about devices 
getting registered during the async stage appearing in different orders on 
different boots due to different timeings.
if you can identify the device well enough to register it quickly then the 
approach that Linus proposed works well, which is
sync probe, identify devices, register devices
async initialize devices
wait for all async to complete
however I'm talking about cases where you can't fully identify the devices 
(at least not well enough to register them with the kernel) and am saying 
that doing
sync probe
async initialize device, register device
wait for all async to complete
results in unpredictable device ordering, but if instead you did
sync probe
async initialize device
sync wait for all async to complete, register device
you can get back to predictable ordering
