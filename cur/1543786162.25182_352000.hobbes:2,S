[I'm assuming that fchmod continues to work even if the path has been  
deleted.]
With Linus's latest patch:
IN_ATTRIB
IN_DELETE_SELF
IN_IGNORE
If we were able to get inoderemove called when the path removal happens,
IN_DELETE_SELF
IN_IGNORE
At this point, inotify would stop monitoring the inode, and we would  
never see the fchmod.
