   1) How do I open a port with a baud rate of 0? Indeed I have a few
   serial ports that don't do exactly what they were designed to do, so I
   also don't like the RTS signal doing funky stuff when I open the port
   just to toggle the DTR signal...
If you really care about this, use a separate process to permanently
keep the serial driver open, and then use the TIOCMSET ioctl's to jiggle
the modem control signals.   
   2) This sounds like an oversight in the driver. I mean I don't know 
   about these semantics, and I write serial drivers....
It's not something the POSIX interfaces really allow for, and it may be
a specialized enough need that "use a custom kernel module" may be the
cleanest solution, especially if you can't allow DTR to flicker even
once after boot-time (when you start the daemon).  Using the modem
control signals to (say) detonate explosives, or some such, is so
outside the design envelope of serial driver interface that I don't feel
that bad if there's no interface to allow that particular usage.
