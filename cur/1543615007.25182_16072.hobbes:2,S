Ok, pre5 gets us in sync with most of the important and easy
to merge bits. Here's a list of whats left between the trees.
Pending:
o  Bunch of __devexit changes
o  Keith's text.lock -> .subsection changes
   Better to merge this first and see whats left broken before merging
   the __devexit changes, in case there are any more bogus ones.
o  Small EISA cleanups
o  Lots of driver updates for ieee1394, ISDN, network drivers, parport
   & paride, USB, MTD.  Hopefully the larger subsystems like USB will
   get pushed by the relevant maintainers who can explain their bits
   to Linus a lot better than I can.
o  VM updates.
o  Various documentation (Will do this last).
o  A few other small things that don't fall under any specific category.
   Code formatting cleanups etc..
Things unlikely to merge yet.
o  Alans aacraid driver (not bio aware)
o  James Simmons fbdev cleanups (needs more testing)
o  Thomas Hoods PNPBIOS work (little more testing to be sure)
o  sbp2 driver fixes from 2.4 (They break with bio)
o  Simple Boot Flag support (more work needed)
o  Small MP Table parsing changes (more testing needed)
o  Reiserfs fixes.
   (Waiting to hear back from the reiserfs folks that I did these ok)
Maybe:
o  Various other driver fixes
   Look ok, depends on next steps for bio.
o  Various sound driver updates.
   Worth doing these with ALSA hopefully on the way ?
o  Manfreds Dynamic LDT
   Needs checking that it hasn't broken x86 math-emu.
o  net core updates
   I'd rather leave this to davem, and see whats left over.
o  Large arch updates for PPC, s390/s390x & Sparc/Sparc64
   Could merge these, or wait for relevant arch maintainer
   to feed maybe newer updates to Linus.
