Very, on architectures where the ABI requires alignment.  E.G. for
vector register loads that require 16-byte alignment to avoid a trap.
The comment for the relevant bits of the GCC configuration says it
won't assume this for x86, but I believe that comment is out of date.
I think it'll assume 16-byte alignment on entrance to non-main()
functions.

Special case.  This is only done for main().
