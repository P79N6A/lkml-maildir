Here's a bit of email I exchanged with Davide Libenzi on epoll (7) man 
page. There is an error in answer 9:

So, the Q9 should be changed:
Q9	Do I need to continuously read/write an  fd  until  EAGAIN when
	using the EPOLLET flag ( Edge Triggered behaviour ) ?
A9	As a general rule, yes. However, there are exceptions.
	With some types of fds it is enough to wait until
	read returns less bytes than was requested by the read call.
Are there any fd types where such behavior is guaranteed by the Linux 
kernel (for the future)? I.e. one can assume that edge-triggered fds 
will behave properly if
	x = read(fd, data, count) and x < count ?
Regular files? Sockets? What?
