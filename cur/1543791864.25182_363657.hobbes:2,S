The aio.c portion looks nice.  I'm not happy about the filesystems bits.
The last thing we want is another set of read/write file operations.  So
as part of the patch (it'll probably grow into a series) we should
remove the aio non-vectored and maybe even the plain vectored
operations.  Doing that will be a lot simpler after I finished sorting
out various bits of duplication in the generic read/write path.  I've
sent the first patch for that to -fsdevel already, but there's a few
more to follow.
