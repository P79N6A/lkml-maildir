I 100% agree with you on this one, but I don't see how playing with
change_mtu() would change anything. Ideally, we would need to export
the level 2 limit (imposed by hardware and intermediate switches) to
other drivers such as 802_1q, and let only the IP stack rely on dev->mtu.
I've seen several drivers which silently add 4 bytes to the hardware
config when CONFIG_VLAN is set. I find it better than fooling the IP
stack into using 1504 bytes, which is a disaster on UDP !
Cheers,
Willy
