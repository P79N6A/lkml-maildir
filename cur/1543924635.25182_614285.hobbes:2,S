Ok, I'm obviously happier, but I have to admit that the original code was 
safer than the new code. It did both the short jump and the far jump 
before reloading any segments.
So I suspect the new code _works_ fine, but it's simply not as 
fundamentally safe as the old code was.
The old code did do some instructions in between the short jump and the 
far jump, but they were all the kind of instructions that didn't care 
about the PE bit: there was a _read_ of the segment descriptor value, but 
that's mode-independent (it's only the writes that matter), and the other 
instructions were bog-standard integer instructions.
So I would actually prefer some additional safety, with something like 
the appended..
This is TOTALLY UNTESTED! I checked with objdump that the result looks 
roughly ok, but I didn't really think through the segment base address in 
that long jump thing. Do we have the difference between flat mode and the 
16-bit bootup mode in some better way?
Hmm?
