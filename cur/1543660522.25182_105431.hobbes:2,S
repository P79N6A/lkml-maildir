We've got LSI, so it's very similar.

Well, if I could get a clean patch against 2.4.20, or possibly some help
fixing the one  I do have, thanks to Ingo, then we'd have a straight
O(1) sched for 2.4.20. I tried merging the patch that Ingo gave me, and
everything seems OK, but I don't have any menu selection for O(1) stuff
in the kernel config.(0 and 100 priority bits)
So I can't tell if it's enabled.

I agree. In the interest of time, I may have to forego O(1), but maybe
I'll get lucky. :) *hint*hint* :)
