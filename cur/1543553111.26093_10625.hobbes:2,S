Why any filesystem at all? Just dump the whole on the diskette in the
drive. If root doesn't know what they are doing fiddling with SysRq, they
deserve it in any case. No FAT, MS-DOS, VFAT or whatever. Just a plain
formated diskette. Remember, this has to be absolutely as simple and robust
as possible, and have minimal impact on the rest of the kernel (no "must
now pull in RW-floppy-format + fat + msdos modules to do SysRq-D", no
"<foo> must be built into the kernel for SysRq-D to work" (at most "floppy
in kernel", more can be hard to swallow in limited environments where this
will be most needed as the only/principal way of looking at logs)).
