In general, is there a correlation between the number
of page faults occurred in the system and bcopy's
performance? If the page fault is high, will the
bcopy's performance become slower? Kindly enlighten me
on this. If you can provide a URL that will support
your answer, I will really appreciate it. Thank you
very much!
