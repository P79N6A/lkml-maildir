You have absolutely no right to place _any_ burden at all on kernel
hackers. "I don't believe..." just doesn't cut it.

So? It is not _your_ call to decide under what conditions (if any) you are
allowed to use said APIs. You did not comply with the conditions as stated.
Nothing more to be said about it, you admitted so yourself.

Third-party driver suppliers are welcome to work _with_ the kernel
community, who will in many cases happily fix their drivers as a matter of
course when updating the kernel. As long as source is available, that
is. If not, hackers don't want to spend time for _others_ to be able to
reap benefits. Go read the GPL, and then think hard about why Linux hackers
elected the GPL as the license for the kernel.

There is a very down-to-earth inconvenience called "license violation"
here. You got a license to use the kernel API under certain conditions, you
violated those.
