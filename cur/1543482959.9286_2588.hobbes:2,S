Do you have performance timings to back this up?  I'd like to see them.

Fine, but vmstat alone means nothing in this respect, because the VM can
play a number of cunning tricks to keep the same swap page both on disk
and in memory.  A large swap usage in vmstat doesn't tell us anything
about how fast things are moving.  Wall clock time is the only reliable
benchmark here.
vmstat is _very_ useful at identifying why you see the observed
performance, but I won't accept that just because vmstat doesn't say
what it used to that the VM must be doing worse!
