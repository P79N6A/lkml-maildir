Hello,
I have an IDE cdrom drive formerly known as /dev/hdc:
hda: IBM-DHEA-36481, ATA DISK drive
hdb: FUJITSU MHC2040AT, ATA DISK drive
hdc: FX810T4, ATAPI CDROM drive
but it does not appear in the devfs namespace in
linux-2.4.0-test2-ac2:
notebook2:/dev/ide/host0/bus1/target0/lun0 # dir
total 0
drwxr-xr-x   1 root     root            0 Jan  1  1970 .
drwxr-xr-x   1 root     root            0 Jan  1  1970 ..
notebook2:/dev/ide/host0/bus1/target0/lun0 #
There is even a CD known to be readable inserted, so does not seem to
depend on wether a CD is inserted or not.
So it is a bug?
Xuân. :o)
