Hello!
Maybe this is a question to stupid for this list,
but I asked for it in de.comp.os.unix.linux.hardware
<bt8tln$4htn0$1@ID-213387.news.uni-berlin.de> and on the Debian user
mailing list, and although many people tried, nobody could help me.
I have a server with a National Semiconductor CS5530 southbridge
(
http://www.national.com/pf/CS/CS5530.html
) and after booting it only
worked in MDMA2. I tried to force it with hdparm -d1X66 but that caused
only nasty messages on syslog, like:
***********************************************************************
Jan  5 16:46:14 server kernel: hda: timeout waiting for DMA
Jan  5 16:46:14 server kernel: ide_dmaproc: chipset supported
ide_dma_timeout fu
nc only: 14
Jan  5 16:46:14 server kernel: hda: status error: status=0x58 {
DriveReady SeekC
omplete DataRequest }
Jan  5 16:46:14 server kernel: hda: drive not ready for command
**********************************************************************
I tried this with the Debian kernel images 2.4.18-bf2.4 and
2.2.20-idepci and with several disks, all the same.
I would have given up hope already, if I had not found out that the
S.u.S.E. 7.3 kernel 2.4.10-4GB has no problem with this chipset at all.
While booting, the kernel says:
hda WDC[...]
ide0 at 0x[...] on irq14
hda: cs5530_set_xfer_mode(UDMA2)
And everything works as fast as I want.
My questions:
1) What's the differences in the kernels to cause this behavior?
2) How do I get my Debian kernel to behave alike?
Any help GREATLY appreciated,
	Kevin
