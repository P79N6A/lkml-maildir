This is one of those systems that has some 150K of dmesg on boot due to 
that pesky USB barfing - IRQ XX nobody cared!.
Due to it's size I haven't included it here.  Here's a link to it 
however -

(There are a lot of unknown devices in lspci output, if an interested 
party wants, I'll provide as much detail as I can.)
