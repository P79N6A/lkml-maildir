  Roland,
     I would like to see these features moved upstream.  DOE funded this
work as part of the items we see needing on our large scale IB
deployment (both present and future).  So from at least one big customer
perspective we see this as useful.  
    I'll let others comment on specific code/implementation issues.
  Thanks,
	- Matt
