I solved the problem: I made a memtest and found a lot of memory-errors, 
then i bought a other brand of memory and everything working fine. The 
first memory i used was brandnew. I bought it together with the board 
and processor. It was from Kingston. Now i have one from Crucial, which 
seems to work fine.
Thanks to everyone for the help
Olli
