What's the story on "driverfs" happening, by the way?  Last I knew, the
PCI bits weren't yet ready.

I don't think that patch is necessary.  It's simpler to just
    strncpy (buf, dev->devpath, min_t(size_t, size, sizeof dev->devpath));
Use like you'd use pci_dev->slot_name ... no mallocation necessary.
It's just the path from root hub down to device, /2/1/7 and so on:  the
physical path, which stays the same so long as you don't recable your
tree of USB devices and hubs.
I'd expect the typical "driverfs" path for a USB device to be the
path for the root hub (normally a PCI slot like 00:0f.3) followed by
what "devpath" now shows.
