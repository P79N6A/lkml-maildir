Hi there, 
My name is Declan O'Shanahan and I am a computer
science student in Trinity College, Dublin in Ireland.
I am trying to find out if there is a way of producing
large integers in the linux kernel. I have found two
packages (lip and gnu mp) both have functions for
producing large integers in user space. I was
wondering if anybody has already produced a set of
kernel functions to do this?
Any help you may provide on this subject would be
appreciated. Thanks for your time.
Best regards,
Declan O'Shanahan.
