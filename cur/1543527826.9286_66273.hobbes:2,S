you don't need the i2c patch w/ 2.3.  I've not had any problems compiling w/ bttv in
2.3.45, 46, or 47. But alas, 2.3.48 won't compile for me just yet (someoen posted
yesterday w/ the same problem i'm having)
I do this to isntall the latest bttv:
cd /usr/src/linux 
make menuconfig  
....... (answer questions)
cd /home/somewhere/bttv-0.7.19
./buildpatch | (cd /usr/src/linux ; patch -p1)
cd /usr/src/linux
make dep ..........................................
reboot
done.
