Hi,
I am on a 2.6.23.11 on a AMD Athlon(tm) XP 1800+.
When I do a sysrq-t, after the dump of task state (that is quite slow 
because of the vesa console framebuffer), I got the message
"Clocksource tsc unstable (delta = 28115415756 ns)
Time: acpi_pm clocksource has been installed."
Is that normal ?
