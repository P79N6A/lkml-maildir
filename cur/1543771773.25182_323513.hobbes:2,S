it turned out that there is nothing wrong with USB on my system.
But someone broke the /dev/input/mouseX <-> USB mouse interaction
in 2.6.11-bk7 and my two-headed system with two X servers were
manually set up to use the distinct mouse devices so the two heads
do not interfere.
No wonder gpm works, it reads /dev/input/mice. Starting only
one X and using /dev/input/mice I found no problems. Setting it
back to /dev/input/mouse0, the mouse pointer is dead again.
Someone deserves a mousebite...
Best regards,
Zoltán Böszörményi
