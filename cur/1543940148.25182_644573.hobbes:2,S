|   in it (offset by a magic value plus to address of the list head), and 
|   thus protects it against accidental corruption? It was capable of

|   detected list corruption of _every_ sort, it detected double
|   list_del() and list_add() of an already active list member as well. It
|   was even capable of detecting SMP races: two parallel unserialized
|   list_del()'s on the same list head were detected and warned about as 
|   well. I guess i should release it one of these days? =B-) ]

interesting... something like hash checks in lockdep?
