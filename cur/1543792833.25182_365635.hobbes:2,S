How does one reduce stack usage in the presence of recursion driven by
user input (referring to expression evaluation)?
Also, NLKD has an extension to the (simplistic) pt_regs frame
(including e.g. floating point state) and may be used to debug itself
(i.e. there may be more than one frame on the stack at a time).
