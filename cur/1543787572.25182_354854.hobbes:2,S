Hmm.. That looks wrong, partly because I don't think it should even set 
ATTR_CTIME _either_. However, I don't see any recent changes to that code, 
so it must have been logn for a long time. That line in do_truncate() has 
been like that since at _least_ 2002.
So what changed to make you notice?
The _code_ actually expects the low-level filesystem to just do it when it 
does the actual truncate itself. That's certainly what ext3 does, for 
example.
A comment or two to that effect might be useful, though.
In other words: some attributes are "implicit". For example, mtime is 
supposed to be set automatically by the filesystem whenever it sees a 
write. The VFS layer will _not_ do a "inode state notify" event for that. 
The same is true of truncation.
But I agree that it's inconsistent. Anybody have any deep opinions?
