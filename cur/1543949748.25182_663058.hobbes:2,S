Ok, that's a bit better, please include it in the changelog information
in the patch next time :)

The issue is for non-hotpluggable slots, right?  That's a big behavior
change, especially for userspace tools not expecting that.

That is correct, but the location seemed a bit "odd", next time around
I'll review it again to be sure.

No, that's a mess, don't do that :)
