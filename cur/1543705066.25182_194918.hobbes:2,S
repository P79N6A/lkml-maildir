Only if there are no prelink conflicts in the read-only sections.
Furthermore, there is additional overhead of remapping RW and back RX
and wasted page.  You can get around that by making a RWX section (which
ends up in the RW segment which gets a PF_X bit set as well), but that means
all the data in that segment is executable, which is obviously not
desirable, especially for libc.so.

Prelink ATM doesn't take VDSO into account at all and surely it would
be best if it did not have to.  For example if VDSO is randomized, userspace
has no control over its placement like it has for shared libraries
(if DSO base is NULL, kernel randomizes, if non-NULL (usually means
prelinked), then does not randomize unless the binary is PIE).
