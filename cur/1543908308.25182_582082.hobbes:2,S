Yes, but before we didn't had any callgraphs for x86_64 since with
framepointers enabled the backtrace is having very strange results too.
I guess this is the best what we can achieve at the moment. Eventually when we
have fast, precise backtraces in the kernel the oprofile code benefits from
that automatically with this patch.
