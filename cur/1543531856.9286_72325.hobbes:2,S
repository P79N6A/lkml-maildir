We've already got raw io so we don't commit to having everything in 
a buffer cache. But we can have a buffer cache by requiring libc to 
use  
               write:
                    if size is too big
                    syscall get_kiobuf_handle ptr,size, COW
                    write_kiobuff(handle);
or something similar.
