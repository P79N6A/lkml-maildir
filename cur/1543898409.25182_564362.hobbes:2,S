Thank you very much for updating the patch. I have a couple of requests though:
1. LEDs shoud use the generic led subsystem instead of input layer. I
do not have plans of adding any more LED_XXX constants and I think
that adding any LEDs not directly relating to keyboard state was a
mistake.
2. It would be nice if driver supported changing its keymaps now that
we allow overriding default getkeycode() and setkeycode().
3. Do not aaccess input_dev->private directly. input_set_drvdata() and
input+_getdrvdata shoudl be used.

Also I don't think the above is correct. I think you need the following here:
   struct input_polled_dev *polldev = input_get_drvdata(dev);
   struct apanal *ap = polldev->private;

Please change to "ipdev->input->dev.parent = &ap->client.dev;"

polledev uses input->private for its own purposed, you need to use
ipdev->private.
Thank you.
