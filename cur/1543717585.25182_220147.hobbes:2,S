Not sure why you're stuck running Krufty Old Kernels, but this patch from
June 2003 should fix it.

#   [PATCH] fix writeback for dirty ramdisk blockdev inodes
#   
#   Once the blockdev inode for /dev/ram0 is dirtied we have a memory-backed
#   inode on the blockdev superblock's s_dirty list.
#   
#   sync_sb_inodes() sees the memory-backed inode on the superblock and assumes
#   that all the other inodes on the superblock are also memory-backed.  This is
#   not true for the blockdev superblock!  We forget to write out dirty pages
#   against the following blockdevs.
#   
#   Fix this by just leaving the inode dirty and moving on to inspect the other
#   blockdev inodes on sb->s_io.
#   
#   (This is a little inefficient: an alternative is to leave dirtied
#   memory-backed inodes on inode_in_use, so nobody ever even considers them for
#   writeout.  But that introduces an inconsistency and is a bit kludgey).
