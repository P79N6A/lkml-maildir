Hi,
Precise kernel version I believe is 2.0.36pre15
I have a multithreaded program I am working on that fairly often makes the
kernel emit
VFS: Close: file count is 0
Sounds like bad news. I know 2.0.36 (and even 2.0.37pre10) has outstanding
multithreading issues (recent mmap corruption reported). However I haven't
seen the problem I am observing reported.
How serious is the bug I am triggering? I am a little nervous about
irritating a production server.
I haven't yet seen 2.2 kernel get upset by my program.
Cheers
Chris
