Yes.  The clock to the CPU isn't actually halted, but the STPCLK input
is pulsed, usually at 4 kHz, with some specific duty cycle.
It saves power roughly linearly with the duty cycle, minus some
overhead.  It tends to be used mostly for thermal protection; if all
you have is duty cycle throttling (or frequency change without
corresponding voltage change), you're usually better off getting
things done as soon as possible and then go into deep sleep instead.
However, if you are about to emit smoke, you don't really have a whole
lot of options.
