Pardon my cynicism, but this reads more like "I'm an ACME Inc. and I
want to sell a proprietary TCP stack for Linux, please change Linux to
make this possible/easy". I doubt there are many Joe Users out there
who want to replace their TCP stack. I bet they would be much happier
to see patches go in which improve the performance of the generic
kernel.
But I'm sure there are plenty of ACME Inc.'s out there who would love
to sell a replacement TCP stack. And suck users down a proprietary
solution path. But I don't see why the Linux community should help the
ACME's of this world. And Linux is doing very nicely in the corporate
world, so we needn't to lose any sleep over what our current policies
do for our acceptance levels.
If it bothers you that Linux caters more the the users and less to the
vendors, then use another OS. We don't mind. The door is over there.
Please don't slam it on your way out.

Yep. And then we can all benefit.
