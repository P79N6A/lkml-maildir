Actually no. The driver will not enable the AUX port unless IRQ12 (or
whatever ACPI/PNP IRQ reported) is available and therefore mouse movement
will not generate any interrupts.
Anyway, I'll shut up if you promise to merge ACPI and PNP together so
i8042 does not have 2 nearly identical implementations in i8042-x86ia64.h
