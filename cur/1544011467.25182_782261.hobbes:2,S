atomic_inc_return seems rather expensive to put on a hot path in
almost every fs operation.  On a multiprocessor system, the cache line
for fsnotify_sync_cookie would be ping-ponging constantly between
processors.  The canonical solution is to form the cookie by
concatenating the processor number with a per-processor cookie, so
that generating a new cookie would not require synchronization between
processors.  Surely this code already exists to be used somewhere in
Linux.
