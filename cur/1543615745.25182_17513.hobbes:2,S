Hi Kevin,
You seem to know what you're doing there, but it would still help if you
could provide some details of your routing configuration and servers,
e.g. output of ifconfig, route -n, and netstat -anot, iptables -L
(provided that the company security policy allows you to share this
info, of course :-). Are you doing NAT between the local net and the
corporate WAN or are you sharing a subnet? Are you sure that it's the
SYN getting lost rather than the SYN-ACK from the server? Even though
your machine is forwarding fine it might still be a routing problem of
some kind.
Cheers,
