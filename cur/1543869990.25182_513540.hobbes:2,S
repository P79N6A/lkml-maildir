I have to agree with Steve here. We have been requesting the inclusion
of myri10ge LRO for 5 months now (before 2.6.19). I could understand
that duplicating LRO code between s2io and myri10ge was not a good idea
at this point. But, I now see that Netxen got merged way later (in
2.6.20) but it got its LRO merged immediately. I guess the LRO is
already duplicated between s2io and netxen then. It does not look fair
to me at all.
Thank you for understanding our concerns.
