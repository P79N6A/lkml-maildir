Direction:  SATA is much more suited to SCSI, because otherwise you wind 
up re-creating all the queueing and error handling mess that SCSI 
already does for you.  The SATA2 host controllers coming out soon do 
full host-side TCQ, not the dain-bramaged ATA TCQ bus-release stuff. 
Doing SATA2 devel in drivers/ide will essentially be re-creating the 
SCSI mid-layer.
Modularity:  drivers/ide has come a long way.  It needed to be turned 
"inside out", and that's what Alan did.  But there's still a lot of code 
that needs to be factored out/about, before hotplugging and device model 
stuff is sane.
Legacy-free:  Because I don't have to worry about legacy host 
controllers, I can ignore limitations drivers/ide cannot.  In 
drivers/ide, each host IO (PIO/MMIO) is done via function pointer.  If 
your arch has a mach_vec, more function pointers.  Mine does direct 
calls to the asm/io.h functions in faster.  So, ATA command submission 
is measureably faster.
sysfs:  James and co are putting time into getting scsi sysfs right.  I 
would rather ride their coattails, and have my driver Just Work with 
sysfs and the driver model.
PIO data transfer is faster and more scheduler-friendly, since it polls 
from a kernel thread.
And for specifically Intel SATA, drivers/ide flat out doesn't work (even 
though it claims to).
So, I conclude:  faster, smaller, and better future direction.  IMO, of 
course :)
