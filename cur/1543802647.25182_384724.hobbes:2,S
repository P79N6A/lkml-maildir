yuk... I'd say the application is a bit dumb for calling waitpid before
it is actually prepared for the pid to be reclaimed. 
A possible solution would be to also defer the waitpid until the main
loop cleanup function, perhaps flagging the entry in the child array as
not-active between the signal and that time or moving the pid from the
active to an inactive array in the signal handler.
