I have no special settings.  It's an out-of-the-box RHL9 server setting,
using NFSv3.  Mounted with "rw,intr".  It's mounted by autofs but this
shouldn't be of any concern here.
I can reproduce it at will and if somebody needs more info, no problem.
 The server should be fine.  I can do the same from another RHL9 machine
or any of our more recent kernels and it works just fine.  It's only the
2.6 kernel client which fails.
Does the 2.0 kernel have NFSv3?  That might be why you don't see it.
