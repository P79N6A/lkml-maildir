ah-hah.  Thanks.
There are two situations:
a) Thread 2 comes in and tries to write a buffer which thread1 didn't write:
   Yes, thread 1 will get confused and will try to write thread 2's buffer.
b) Thread 2 comes in and tries to write a buffer which thread 1 is
   writing.  (Say, the buffer was redirtied by
   munmap->__set_page_dirty_buffers, which doesn't lock the page or the
   buffers)
   Thread 2 will fail the test_set_buffer_locked() and will redirty the page.
That's all a bit too complex.   How's about this instead?

Aside: can the redirty_page_for_writepage() ever happen any more?  Can a
buffer against a locked page be locked by some other actor?  I guess so -
kjournald in ordered mode might be trying to write the buffer as well,
perhaps...
