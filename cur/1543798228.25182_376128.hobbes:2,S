That seems like a lot of assumptions. Is it really better than the 
existing GFP_ATOMIC which works basically the same?  It has a lot
more users that compete true, but likely the set of GFP_CRITICAL users
would grow over time too and it would develop the same problem.
I think if you really want to attack this problem and improve
over the GFP_ATOMIC "best effort in smaller pool" approach you should
probably add real reservations. And then really do a lot of testing
to see if it actually helps.
