The other thing we can do is set up "spoof" users per category, then 
anyone can just set up that spoof user to watch, and they'll see things
for each category. Some of them are like that already.
Frankly, I think a lot of people would prefer to subscribe to
bugme-new@lists.osdl.org, and then filter on the X- headers that give 
you category and subcategory nicely. That way you get one email for
each NEW bug. depends what you want.

Is done now. Please try, but be gentle with it. And send beer to Kees ;-)

I think it will now. We probably need some more crap-filtering (rmk
pointed out signatures, for instance, not sure if we do that already).
Apologies this has taken a while.

The external one is infintely simpler than the internal IBM one, and
the distro ones. I *really, really* prefer to keep it that way. Having 
said that, it does have a few fields (eg version, and category/subcategory) that should be filled out properly, and that's not easy to do via email.
For now, my intent is to allow bug filing via web only, and followup 
comments by email. If lots of people scream and curse at me, I'll
reconsider I suppose.

I think this could easily be a per-user preference. I think akpm would
like it to default to on, which would be OK by me, at least.
Apologies for neglecting Bugzilla a bit recently, I shall get back on it.
Kudos to Jon Tollefson (IBM) and Kees Cook (OSDL) for doing most of
the technical work recently.
