I'm working on a web-based filesystem for a class term project. The idea
is to be able to have web servers show up as directory trees on the local
machine. Example:
  cd /web/www.cs.wisc.edu/ ; cat index.html 
would be equivalent to pulling the page down. Right now the HTTP access is
handled by a user-level daemon, and the kernel filesystem is an
indirection layer. The FS gets a read request for a file, passes it to the
daemon which either a) downloads the file or b) retrieves it from on-disk
cache, passes a pointer (of some sort) back to the kernel, which returns a
file descriptor.
Now for the questions.
1) Is this sane?
2) Where should I start looking to write a FS? I've looked through the
   O'Reilly site, but all I found was "Kernel device drivers" which I'm
   not sure is what I want.
3) Suggestions? I'd like this to have an existence after the end of the
   semester. 
Thanks,
Drew
