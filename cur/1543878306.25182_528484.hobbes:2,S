I just tried the approach that we discussed earlier and it was not 
nice either. Lets just use a page flag please. This check will be in 
several hot code paths. And it may become more important because the file 
system folks want to support buffers > page size. Then we may want more 
transparent support for huge pages... For all of this page->private gets 
in the way.
And I think we curently have 5 or so page flags available?
