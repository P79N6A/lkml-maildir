PINE is PAINFUL - you'd better get mutt (
http://www.mutt.org
) or another
reliable mail application.

I am using the following rules at the beginning of my .procmailrc.
These filter almost all japanese messages except ones which do not specify
their character set.
-- START
:0
* content-type:.*charset.*iso-2022-jp
/dev/null
:0
* content-type:.*charset.*big5
/dev/null
-- END
