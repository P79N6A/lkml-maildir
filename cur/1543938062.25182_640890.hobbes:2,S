This variable is not defined when emacs starts up.  Best is to always
use a hook.
So I'd suggest either
	(add-hook 'c-mode-hook (lambda () (c-set-style "linux")))
or for the conditional case
	(add-hook 'c-mode-hook
                  (lambda ()
                    (c-set-style
                      (or (and (string-match "/usr/src/linux"
                                             (or (buffer-file-name) ""))
                               "linux")
                          "free-group-style"))))
Perhaps the logic could be a bit more readable :-)
Other than that, good idea to finally remove this ugly recommendation!
