To clarify, by the above I didn't necessarily mean "split one process
into two processes".  A kernel API where you can wait for a named
object or a subsystem to complete it's startup / shutdown would be
just as well.  Or simply waiting on (dis-)appearance of named files in
a dedicated directory named "boot_sequence" in sysfs, would be another
equally fine way to accomplish above scheme.
