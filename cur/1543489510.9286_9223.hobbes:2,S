Hi,
I was assigned a job to set up a server for an ISP in here, but I'm
having problems.
First a short description of what is there. An IBM Netfinity 500
(2x350 iPII), 128M ram, 18Gig SCSI (Adaptec 78xx). RedHat 5.2.
The cdrom does not mount regulary while running 2.2.0, and 2.2.2
kernels the directory where I point to mount changes to a executable
file at 0 size. It worked fine with 2.0.36 (that came with RH5.2). I
compiled the kernel several times looking for what I'm missing... but
it seems OK. 
What do you think it is?
Also, what which kernel would you suggest me to use. I'd like to use
both processors.
thank you,
cheers
Kledi
