I believe that it's not right. There is no need for it - the excuses for it 
have been "It shouldn't really cause a problem", without any good reason for 
it being advanced. It _does_ cause problems, and it doesn't appear to be 
necessary.
Can anyone give a sensible reason for putting this in the kernel, other than 
the dubious advantage of saving a few keystrokes for sysadmins who don't use 
their distribution's init scripts to set up routes.
(Let's ignore for the moment the fact that Linus isn't likely to remove it 
from 2.2 - the distributors may well do so, and it can be dropped from 2.3).
