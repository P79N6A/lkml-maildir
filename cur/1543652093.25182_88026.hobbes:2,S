For what it's worth. On my system I have problems with 2.5.4[56]. And they
seem to be related to USB. When I boot with nousb it boots OK. But without
this option I get OOPSes and panics everywhere. The system is happy with
2.5.44.
Some of these OOPSes happen during shutdown in device_shutdown. But panics
during boot are happening too. And then all I see on my screen is that the
call-trace in is reap_timer_fnc somewhere.
I've tried switching on USB_DEBUG, but that didn't help much. Neither the
DEBUG=1 in drivers/base/power.c.
My machine has a MSI K7T266 Pro motherboard with Athlon 1.3GHz. It has a
VIA chipset, 82C686b+VT8233. Harddisk: IBM Deskstar 60GXP, 40Gb.
I'm using CONFIG_USB_UHCI_HCD_ALT=y
