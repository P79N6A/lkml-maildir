Hello,
I have some blur memories about this kind of issue, so my answer my be 
wrong on some points...

IIRC, Linux 255.255.255.255 as a normal IP address. Therefore it will 
follow the route for such an address and select the interface it is 
associated (probably eth0 if you are on a LAN).

Again, I'm not sure, but I think that you can force the interface by 
adding a special route for IP 255.255.255.255 and with mask 
255.255.255.255 to the interface you want.

Hope this help, even if my memory is a bit confused,
