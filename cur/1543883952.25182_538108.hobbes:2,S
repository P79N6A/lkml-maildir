Yes I mean like this. But I do not only talk about me. I talk about many many others.
Above that you flamed Edgar Toernig with the invented alibi for not signing his contributions (yes I say invented alibi and I mean it exactly that way - in so far the word "gatekeeper" is no invention in this context at all, it's just a very cynical expression that shows a lot of frustration).
To get it back to the comprehensive layer:
1. 4 unusable kernels are not just another cavalier's delict, but just a very harsh and deep cut in kernel development history (read: the time space for that breakdown is close to 9 or 10 months). This could have been some three months or less if you weren't the personality that you obviously are representing.
2. Although I tried to tell you a thousand times that I prefer to optimize the existing (read: bttv dependent - even if it may sound senseless to you) concept you continued to pursue a dead born child called cx878.
This hopeful project which I would have highly admired if it ever were finished did not only die out of the personal time schedule of a very capable kaffeine developer called Christoph Pfister (who did the main work for it - not you), but it simply died as a consequence of your obviously missing knowledge.
Some i2c bus bindings were missing - in so far the mounting of a 2000 meters high mountain was cancelled 50 meters before the top.
So what do I mean by optimizing the existing concept?
Very simple: Deselectable DST module, deselectable DST_CA module, deselectable dvb-pll module - not more - not less.
Now if this very humble concept works, if all this horrible dvb_core_attach stuff and other problems are resolved let's talk about getting rid of all the not necessary bttv dependency nonsense, but never vice versa and never before that.
Read: long way, small steps, but no breakdowns.
Did I pronounce clear now, Mister Abraham? It can't be that hard to understand this, can it?
