Another "me too" I'm afraid.  I'm running 2.6.6 on an ordinary UP Athlon 
system under Gentoo, and it behaves very strangely.  About 3 out of 4 times, 
it hangs during boot-up, at the "Freeing unused kernel memory" stage, and 
seems to not get as far as calling init....
Yesterday, it got past that stage, and the various startup scripts began to 
run, but *achingly* slowly.  It took about 10 minutes to get most of the 
network services started, with no login prompt in sight - I got fed up and 
rebooted then, because I needed to get some work done!
I rebooted with 2.6.6-rc3, which has always been absolutely fine.
Let me know if any other info would be useful....
Cheers
Alastair
