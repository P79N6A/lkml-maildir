Also note:
The SCSI-CD driver is also required if you want any kind of
reasonable performance for cdparanoia (the music CD ripper),
even for perfectly ordinary CD or DVD drives.  This took me
a couple tries last weekend, and I even knew what the problem
was.
Is there _any_ hardware where the ide-cd driver works better
than ide-scsi emulation?
If not, I suppose the only reason to keep it around is so 
people don't need to compile all the SCSI support just for 
ordinary access to ISO-9660 cds with an IDE CDROM.
In the meantime, perhaps the kernel configuration help could 
mention this little gotcha?  And maybe distributions should 
make ide-scsi the default?  At least CD ripping would work 
"out of the box" like that.
