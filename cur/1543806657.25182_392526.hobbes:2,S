Hello,
I don't think this is a BIOS issue, but a kernel bug in the i386 tree.  I believe this was recently discussed and hopefully fixed by Andi Kleen in the kernel mailing list:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/9/442
This is a critical bug especially for systems running AMD Dual-Core Processors on i386 kernel configuration w/ powernow-k8.
The reason for "powernow-k8 - out of sync" errors is because the cpufreq driver is not aware [or has the wrong idea] about which CPUs are tied together, because cpu_core_id and phy_proc_id data is wrong.
Now this is fairly harmless as Mark mentioned, but only on single socket Dual Core systems.
On a multi-socket multi-core system, it will result in something like: (2 dual-core Opterons)
cpu0:
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root    0 Nov  3 09:51 cpufreq
cpu1:
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root    0 Nov  3 09:51 cpufreq
cpu2:
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    0 Nov  3 09:51 cpufreq -> ../../../../devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cpufreq
cpu3:
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    0 Nov  3 09:51 cpufreq -> ../../../../devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cpufreq
In this configuration, the second processors will never be able to be managed by a governor.
I was wondering if anyone has already tested Andi's patch, if it successfully solves this problem, and if the patch has made it into the git yet.
Thanks,
