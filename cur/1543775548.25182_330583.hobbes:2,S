I don't know about this particular bridge, but in general you can
have 64-bit transfers over PCI(-X) corresponding to 32-bit transfers
over local bus. The local bus has to be twice as fast as PCI bus or
you won't be able to saturate PCI bus. Especially if it's the bridge
doing PCI BM DMA transfers (and not, say, another processor on the
local bus).
