Thanks, I'll take care of sending this upstream. I think that you're
currently required to "sign off" a patch when you sent it over to
maintainers. See e.g. 
http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS3012318028.html
for details. It's really as simple as including a line
"Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <you@mail.com>" in your patch email.
See 
http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/3180
 for details and Linus' initial
email.
Thanks,
Ronald
