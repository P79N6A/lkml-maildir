Well Alan, with RAID the upgrade was pretty dangerous - you had
to mess around with converting important, critical config files by hand
(mdtab -> raidtab) and people feared they could lose their data. At least
I did. And if you created a new style RAID partition there was no way
to go back to a kernel < 2.2.12.
All of those facts do not apply to the kernel NFS server upgrade.
It's just a tools upgrade, there is _no_ chance of data loss at all.
If you want to go back to 2.2.12, downgrade the tools, be done.
Sorry by the way if you thought some of my remarks were obnoxious
Mike.
