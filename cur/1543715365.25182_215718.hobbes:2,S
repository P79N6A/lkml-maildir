Hello all,
   I can sucessfully suspend with 'echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep' on my Toshiba
Satellite 1410-S173. It also wakes up fine, except after waking it jumps to
init 0 and shuts down. It's been this way with every kernel I have tried
since 2.6.4. I know it worked with 2.6.1 but I'm not sure exactly at what
point between that and 2.6.4 it changed, or even if this is a userspace or
kernel issue. Yesterday I tried with 2.6.6-rc2 and rc2-mm1 and it still
behaves the same.
Any suggestions?
tia,
