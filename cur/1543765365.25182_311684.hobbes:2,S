Probably close to the 2.6.11 kernel I run on Debian-pure64/sarge.

growisofs -Z /dev/hdc -J -R /path/to/dir/with/less/than/4.5GB/of/files
That should do it.  To do scsi I suspect it would be /dev/sg0 or
/dev/scd0.  I haven't actually tried burning in scsi emulation mode with
these drives.
growisofs is part of dvd+rw-tools.  It will autoformat the disc if
needed.
