It's more than rumour - I've seen this done. Dr Solomon's (whatever
they called their data recovery branch), early 1990's, England.
Maybe it was easier on older hardware like the MFM / RLL disks,
and certainly easier to piece together fragmented data with earlier
file formats.
I believe the point of overwriting 3 times (or whatever) is to reduce
the "subtracted difference" to noise levels where it's no longer useful.

This only deals with your first method (which I agree, sounds unlikely
to work).

PS. I've also seen a disk arm being wound across an opened disk
platter by a micrometer strapped to the head by a rubber band, 
to recover real data. Most amusing ;-).
