I wouldn't say that I do, but no one else seems to be answering this.
list_add_tail does head->prev and making the call with a NULL 'head' looks
bad to me. I would prefer:
diff -ur -X exclude linux-2.4.0-test12-pre8-orig/fs/smbfs/sock.c linux-2.4.0-test12-pre8-smbfs/fs/smbfs/sock.c

or just leaving the list as it is. It will be initialized anyway by
schedule_task (queue_task), but using the init macro seems like a nice
thing to do.
