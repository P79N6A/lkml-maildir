Yeah, after sending that mail I realized I accepted this fact way back...
But I disagree in that it is easy to avoid not write-lcling the mm 
semaphore: A simple malloc() might lead to a mmap() call creating trouble. 
Am I right?

Because the rw_mutex is translated into a rt_mutex - as you say below.

I disagree. You lay a large burdon on the users of PI futexes to avoid 
write locking the mm semaphore. PI boosting those writers would be a good 
idea even in the mainline.

That is how -rt works and should work. No disagrement there.

1) How much slower would the pi_rw_mutex I suggested really be? As far as 
I see there is only an overhead when there is congestion. I can not see 
that that overhead is much larger than a non-PI boosting implementation.
2) I know that execution time isn't bounded in the main-line - that is why 
-rt is needed. But it is _that_ bad? How low can you get your latencies 
with preemption on on a really busy machine?
Basically, I think PI futexes should provide the same kind of latencies 
as the basic thread latency. That is what the user would expect.
Priority invertions should be removed, but ofcourse you can't do better 
than the OS does otherwise.
