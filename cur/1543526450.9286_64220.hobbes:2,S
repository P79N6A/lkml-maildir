   On the other hand for 2.4 we can only do this if someone has or
   will do the usermode initrd for it and put it up somewhere.  Post
   2.4 it has-to-go.  DHCP is the routine system now, we already cant
   handle it without an initrd
I agree with you, but I think it's unwise to delete it for 2.4.x
There simply have been too many new-platform bootstraps this
little "hack" has helped out, and until something which really
replaces it, and is as simple, comes along, we would be
wise to keep it around.
