Subject: Bandwidth Allocations under CFQ I/O Scheduler

The I/O priority levels available under the CFQ scheduler are
nice (no pun in intended), but I remember some talk back when
they first went in that future versions might include bandwidth
allocations in addition to the 'niceness' style.  Is anyone out
there working on that?  If not, I'm willing to hack up a proof
of concept... I just wan't to make sure I'm not reinventing
the wheel.
Thanks,
