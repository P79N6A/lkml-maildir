Checked the Promise 20275 manual, no device present bits.
It seems we still need IDENTIFY DEVICE to identify the phantom slave.
The IDE code uses polling for IDENTIFY DEVICE. (libata did the same.)
Maybe we can also use polling for IDENTIFY DEVICE?
Could you try the attached patch to see if polling helps
to reduce the boot time? Thanks.
