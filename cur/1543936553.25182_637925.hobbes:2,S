Ah, of course, stupid me.  Thought I was on linux-audio-user where
this is a FAQ (for completely different reasons) and not LKML.
But this is strange - I'm sure I've seen people using that driver with
a shared IRQ before.
Jan, maybe you can blacklist ohci-hcd as a workaround?  In any case
let's take this discussion off LKML so as not to spam the list with
binary only driver issues.
