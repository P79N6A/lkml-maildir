No one will review it if it isn't in the proper CodingStyle.
We have a coding style for a reason, it makes it a very simple thing for
anyone to review the code as the patterns are all the same.  It turns
out that people's brains get trained to ignore the patterns and see the
details instead.  Lots of research backs this up.
So switch to the common coding style, otherwise no one will look at your
code (or if they do, odds are they will miss a lot...)
