He uses Elm, which as far as I know is obsolete, unmaintained and
full of bugs and even has Y2K problems.  That is the last I heard
anyway.  Alan Cox would likely know more, and has perhaps even
fixed Elm.
PINE is virtually everywhere, and is a good elm replacement,
having been initially based on the elm code... (PINE==Pine Is Not
Elm)
