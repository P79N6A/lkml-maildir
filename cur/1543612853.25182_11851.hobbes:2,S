Its nothing to do with reassembly. My guess is that the irq handling or the
other driver locks on the ISA driver are holding off the sound.

Oh thats easy. 2.0 performs like crap on SMP boxes. 
The newer code is intended to do sensible things for NE2K drivers however so
I am curious what is fouling up. It even goes to the trouble to avoid
disabling all interrupts during a transmit event.
What might be interesting would be to edit 8390.c and change
        /* Mask interrupts from the ethercard.
           SMP: We have to grab the lock here otherwise the IRQ handler
           on another CPU can flip window and race the IRQ mask set. We end
           up trashing the mcast filter not disabling irqs if we dont lock
	*/
        spin_lock_irqsave(&ei_local->page_lock, flags);
        outb_p(0x00, e8390_base + EN0_IMR);
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&ei_local->page_lock, flags);
 
to use 
	/* this is the missing spin_trylock_irqsave longhand.. */
	save_flags(flags);
	__cli();
	if(!spin_trylock(&ei_local->page_lock))
	{
		restore_flags(flags);
		return 1;
	}
        outb_p(0x00, e8390_base + EN0_IMR);
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&ei_local->page_lock, flags);
