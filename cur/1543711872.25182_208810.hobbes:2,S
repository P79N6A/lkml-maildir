Yes - making the *_complement ops into two operand (dst, src) would be a
good idea, Bill.  Thanks.  I will likely include that in what I'm doing
now.
Meanwhile, Matthew's patch 5/7 appears broken here.
My current understanding of the complement op is that it is broken for
non-word multiple sizes.  There's a good chance I'm still be confused on
this matter.
It might make sense to redo this particular bit of offline logic not by
using *_complement, but rather by looping over all nodes, and only
acting if not online, thus avoiding the *_complement() operator for now.
I have not thought through the performance implications of such a code
inversion, however.
