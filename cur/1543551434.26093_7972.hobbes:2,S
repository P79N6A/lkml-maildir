I'd say that NOT using NFSv3 for production is nothing but folly.
The NFSv3 that's in v2.2.18pre15 seems to work VERY fine (we've beaten
quite heavily on it without being able to make it barf), and losing
all the benefits of NFSv3 in a productionenvironment where NFS is needed
isn't an option. I think we should be very lucky that we finally got the
NFSv3 client to work, and really encourage people to use it, because
Linux has a very bad reputation when it comes to NFS, and it's time to
prove to people that we don't suck as much as they believe... :^)
