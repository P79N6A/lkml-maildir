Its really useful to have a thread per IRQ and to have an option to
run a particular IRQ handler in hardirq context. Then a system designer
or adminstrator can tune the priorities of different IRQ handler threads
depending on the latency requirements of a particular system. Scott's 
patch posted earlier (see link below) implements this -- this has proven
handy in many scenarios including, but not restricted to, audio
real-time 
performance.
