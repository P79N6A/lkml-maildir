This one seems on par with SD, but there are still some nice issues.
Try running 3 chew.c's, then renicing one to -10, starves others for some 
seconds while switching prio-level.  Now renice it back to 10, it starves 
for up to 45sec.
Also, nice levels are only effective on every other step; ie:
 ... -3/-2 , -1/0 , 1/2 ... yields only 20 instead of 40 prio-levels.
Thanks!
