Normally I don't respond, being on the digest and not a kernel hacker,
but I discovered the problem in sb_card.c by snarfing through the 2.3.47
patch. There are several places where this appears:
#if defined CONFIGISAPNP || defined CONFIG_ISAPNP_MODULE
But it should actually be:
#if defined CONFIG_ISAPNP || defined CONFIG_ISAPNP_MODULE
If you fgrep the file for CONFIGISAPNP you will quickly find the problem
points. After changing it, the module inserted correctly and sound is
back.
