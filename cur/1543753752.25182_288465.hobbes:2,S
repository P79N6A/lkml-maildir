You sure about that?
Actually, I think my patch was broken anyhow for HZ < 1000 because you
can potentially get integer-overflows in temporary results which could
make things come out wrong again.
I _think_ the attached patch works for all reasonable cases reasonably
uniformly, but if you thought the previous patch was subtle, I'm sure
you going to like this one even less.
Note that with the patch, platforms where HZ is not a power of two and
doesn't fit any of the other special cases (namely (HZ % 1000) != 0 &&
(1000 % HZ) != 0) would suffer a penalty.  AFAICS, this is true only
for Alpha/Rawhide (HZ=1200).  In such a case, rather than:
	(j * 1000)/HZ
the new code would compute:
	(j/HZ)*1000 + ((j%HZ)*1000)/HZ
It looks to me like we could get rid of all the ugly & complex
intermediate overflow-checks if we defined MAX_JIFFY_OFFSET
as:
	(~0UL / 1000)
However, on a 32-bit platform that runs at 1000 Hz, this would limit
us to 4294 seconds.  That may be cutting it a bit close.
