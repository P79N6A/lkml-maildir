Hi Krishna,
Are you looking for documentation or source?
Ingo Molnar maintains the current -rt patch set that makes the vanilla
linux kernel real-time.
You can get the source from here:
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/realtime-preempt/
Or if you have the latest version of ketchup you can just do the following
in a empty directory:
  $ ketchup 2.6.16-rt20
Which would bring you upto the current latest of the patch (as of this
email).
