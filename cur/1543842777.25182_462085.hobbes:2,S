No, this would be an alternate model that if enabled would give us the
full Posix Capabilities draft compliance and which would hopefully
make us be mostly compatible with Trusted Solaris and Trusted Irix.
Like SELinux, it's something that would have to be explicitly enabled,
and yes, does break compatibility with standard root privileges ---
but then again, break apart root privs was the whole *point* of the
Posix capabilities design....

Per system defaults would also be good, but I believe it would also be
a good idea for their to be per-filesystem defaults.  Yes, not all
filesystems would support per-filesystem defaults, since this requires
extensions in their superblock; for those, they would only have the
per-system defaults.

But that means libc would need to know which bit positions were
positive capabilities, and which were negative, and adding new
capabilities would require a matching change with libc.  Not a good
idea, I think....
