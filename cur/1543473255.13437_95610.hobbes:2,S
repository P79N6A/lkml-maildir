Yes, that probably would have avoided the problem.  The issue was that the code
was simply ORing the IRQ bits with whatever was previously in the register on
the card, instead of replacing them.  This meant that if you were setting it to
use the same IRQ as it had already previously been using it was fine, but any
other setting caused it to combine bits from the new and old settings and use
some unpredictable IRQ instead.
