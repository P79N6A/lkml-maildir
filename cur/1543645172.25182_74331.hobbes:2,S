Oh, I was commenting on possible files_lock contention on mbligh's
NUMA-Q.

I remember seeing fget() high up in specweb profiles. I suspect that
fget profile count is high because it just happens to get called very 
often for most workloads (all file syscalls) and the atomic 
operations (SMP) and the function call overhead just adds to the cost. 
If possible, we should try inlining it too.
