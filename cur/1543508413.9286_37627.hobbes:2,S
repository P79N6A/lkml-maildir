Hi,
I have recently complied a new kernel for a router I am setting up but
the problem seems to be that the kernel is to large for lilo's liking
around 1.6MB
Is there a workaround this? and if so could you please tell me fast as
I need to get a workaround and I have already tried to take as much
stuff out of the kernel and a lot of the stuff is not available in
modules
Thank you for any help
