You don't need an adaptec to BUG on scsi read errors.
I have a tekram adapter using the new SYM53C8XX version 2 driver.
One of my quantum atlas IV have a few bad sectors.  Reading
the file (ext2 fs on top of raid0) tends to merely cause error messages.
badblocks also runs fine.  But fsck -c triggers the BUG.
