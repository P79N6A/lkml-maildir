Subject: patch O1int for 2.5.73 - interactivity work
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi all 
I've used the corner cases described that cause a lot of the interactivity 
problems to develop this patch. What it does different to default (without 
nasty hacks) is the following:
The interactivity is based on the max sleep avg (10s) as previously, unless 
the thread has been running for less than 10s. In that case it is based on 
the duration it has been running, with a minimum of 10 jiffies to estimate 
the interactivity (perhaps more might be appropriate here). This should 
minimise tasks taking ages to be categorised as interactive.
If tasks sleep for a long time (>1s) they are no longer classified as 
interactive, but idle - meaning they receive their static priority. However, 
since they _may_ become interactive, the period over which the interactivity 
is estimated is decreased (1sec, perhaps can be reduced) so they may become 
interactive rapidly again. This should minimise idle tasks (like BASH) that 
suddenly become cpu hungry from stalling everything.
I'm still working on something for the "xmms stalls if started during very 
heavy load" as a different corner case.
This is only a compile tested patch (need sleep bad) but has been tested in 
2.4 form and works nicely at avoiding those corner test cases.
Please comment and test if you can.
