May not be portable because you're apparently not supposed to assume
anything about the memory sharing semantics (eg. it may share memory
or it may not -- AFAIK if your code doesn't work correctly after
replacing vfork with fork, then it is buggy).
What's wrong with _exit(exec() == -1 ? 0 : errno);
and picking up the status with wait(2) ?
