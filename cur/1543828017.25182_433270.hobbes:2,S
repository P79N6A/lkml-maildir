akpm sent it to me, so I merged it into my tree, and now I've been
sitting on it all this week because I've taken the decision that I
do not want to put anything further into Linus' tree until we actually
see 2.6.17.
If you look at what Linus said when he released -rc7, the reason we
had -rc7 instead of -final was that we had too many changes.  We can
either go on throwing more and more changes, albiet 100% correct
bug fix changes, and carry on releasing -rc after -rc, but at some
point there must be an end to this, and -final must happen.
It's been three months since 2.6.16 was released.  I'm not prepared
to be the reason that we have another week of -rc-ism because of too
many small but apparantly correct changes.
