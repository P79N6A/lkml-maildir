It seems hackish to pass a needlock arg to an API, and that that we'll end 
up with some conceptually similar call-outs for both caps and setuid.
How about encapsulating this stuff so that there's something like:
	err = should_remove_privs();
	if (err)
		remove_privs();
with
void remove_privs()
{
	mutex_lock();
	__remove_privs();
	mutex_unlock();
}
and then __remove_privs() handles the logic for all file privileges, 
including at this stage suid and the LSM call for file caps ?
