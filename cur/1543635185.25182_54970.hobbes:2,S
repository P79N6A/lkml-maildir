I agree, this is the correct and clean thing to do.
It rather implies that any function in a module which calls
MOD_{INC,DEC}_USE_COUNT should always be called from a non-module
function which _itself_ protects the module from removal by temporarily
bumping the use count.

That's already done in `try_inc_mod_count', it's just a bit slow.  But
arguably it's only impact is when you're getting a handle or creating an
object, which is usually relatively slow anyway, such as opening a
device or socket, or adding a firewall rule.
The more I think about it, the more I think the `owner' thing in
file_operations et al. is the right thing in all cases, and that Al Viro
is right about the overhead being reasonable.  Perhaps the interface
could be made a little more generic (`{get,put}_module_reference'?), and
double check the corner cases such as when a module is in "don't use"
mode, blocking and scheduling a reload.
