Tim,
At the risk of Jens jumping on this post, I think
there was some problem mounting cdroms that is
fixed in the "ac" series, the latest of which is
2.4.3-ac5 . Perhaps you could try it and report
back.
The fact that you can write a cd (which does not
involve the sr driver) means that the rest of the SCSI
subsystem and the ide-scsi driver seem to be working
ok. I doubt that this is a problem with the mount
command.
