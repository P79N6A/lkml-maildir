I saw this same warning/problem in my out-of-tree drivers when the
"TTY_DRIVER_NO_DEVFS" flag went away somewhere between 2.6.17 and
2.6.18.
You need to change this line:
isicom_normal->flags                    = TTY_DRIVER_REAL_RAW;
To:
isicom_normal->flags                    = TTY_DRIVER_REAL_RAW |
TTY_DRIVER_DYNAMIC_DEV;
In the "drivers/char/isicom.c" file.
