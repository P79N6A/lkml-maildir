No can do... There are 100s of scenarios where the server can screw
the client by giving it bogus information. You might possibly be able
to protect against a few of them, but at a heavy price in the form of
code bloat.
Neither NFSv2 nor NFSv3 are protocols that were designed to operate
safely in a hostile environment. They were designed for LANs where
servers and clients trust one another.
I agree that we shouldn't Oops though.

Please do...
