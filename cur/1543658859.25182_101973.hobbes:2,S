Can we please end this discussion.
Go harass cygwin users that they should call their systems GNU/Windows.
Or the FreeBSD/NetBSD guys that use a gcc compiler. I ran some FSF tools
on my Amiga, does that make it a GNU/Amiga? Same for the guy who got gcc
on 20 floppies for his GNU/Atari ST. How about all those Solaris and
Irix systems where administrators installed GNU tools in /usr/local
(GNU/Solaris and GNU/Irix?).
This mailinglist is about the linux _kernel_, there must be more
apropriate lists for this (/dev/null comes to mind).
