I don't think so.  At least the

The trick is not to identify processes.

Fortunately, they do carry the necessary data in the Linux kernel.
Otherwise, you would have a pretty hard time to implement the
netfilter owner match rules.
My current approach is the following: fstat() the socket to get its
inode, look up the inode in /proc/net/tcp to get a (local, remote)
pair.  Swap the pair and search /proc/net/tcp again to get the UID the
other end.  No race condition is possible because the kernel may not
create a new (remote, local) pair because we hold open the (local,
remote) socket, so even a SO_REUSEADDR will not do the trick.

Yes, that might be a problem, but this affects netfilter as well.  The
kernel structure records the effective UID of the process at the time
of the creation of the socket.  It might have changed afterwards.

Hmm, you can always forward connections, so this isn't a problem.  If
some decides to give his credentials away, he is free to do so. ;-)
