      Hi kernel hackers,
      I have to write a MSc thesis about Linux and I have a hot topic that I
want to ask if it's possible to do.
      Is it possible to change kernel in some manner that there isnt anymore
necessity to reboot when upgrade it to a major version?
      Thanks,           Paulo Henrique
