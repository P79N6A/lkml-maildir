Oops you're right. I wanted to fix that, but didn't. Ok I'll put up
my brown paper back tonight when I go out.

What optimizing? It wasn't intended to be an optimization.
It fixes a bug.
Not doing set_memory_uc on efi_ioremap output is needed because 
set_memory_uc doesn't work on fixmap which is what efi_ioremap
returns. 
(see previous mails on that topic -- i fixed the 'x' case,
but fixing "uc" is too hard imho) 
So I fixed efi_ioremap instead to set the correct caching
mode directly. That is ok because there can be no overlap 
with the direct mapping, so no aliases to fix up.

I've always used RED-PEN
% grep -r RED-PEN arch/x86/* | wc -l
12
%
It comes originally from network code I hacked a long time ago, although
most of those got lost over time (only 2 left, sniff) 
Sorry I don't want to change this now and I doubt that will really cause
a problem for anybody.
I'll send an updated patch with the va thing fixed.
