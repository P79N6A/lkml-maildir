As a relative newcomer to LINUX quite a lot of it is a foreign language,
(no awful pun intended).  I've been around electronics and computers for
quite a few years now.  So would you be so kind as to explain just what
is "GPE_L00" and "DSDT".  And just how we remove the salient part?
I have a new Acer Aspire 1304LC which I could cook an egg on.
Windoze(2K & XP Pro) don't generate anything like so much warmth.
