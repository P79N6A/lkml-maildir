It's sufficient for local file systems. Or see it this way: The
machine, that mounted it r/o will NOT write to it until it is
mounted r/w again.
I also like the "kill/finish all outstanding writes" idea (kill
or finish should depend on the MNT_FORCE option). Once we've
implemented it, forcible unmount becomes trivial ;-)
Forcible unmount is high on the wish list of several admins I
know.
