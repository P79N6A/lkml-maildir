OK, open is out.  However other operations (stat, unlink, chmod etc)
are always without side effects on "normal" filesystems.  However on
FUSE they are very much unsafe (can block, not do what was instructed
and return success, etc).

I agree wholeheartedly.  However, I'm not arguing this point, because
it has been (rightly) pointed out, that private namespaces can be used
to solve this.  While the suid issue is not solvable with private
namespaces.

Probably not file access patterns.  But yes I don't consider this a
very grave problem.

Yes, but I think that's OK, because if the directory is writable on
which you mount, than you can hide the data already (unlinking it, but
keeping a reference though a file descriptor).  And it's not very
effective hiding, since a bind mount of the mountpoint's filesystem
will reveal what's underneeth the FUSE mount.

It's been thrown out for the reason, that it's unacceptable if suid
programs see a different namespace as non-suid.

Yes.  Please explain that to Al Viro, Christoph Hellwig et. al.
Believe me it's not something that's easy to get across, and I'm very
happy that you see it this way too :).
