I agree that that would make the most sense, but that's *not* what the 
author wrote:
"Although the file system consistency check would ensure that the file
 system is consistent, the lack of ordering on operations can lead to
 confused applications or, even worse, crashing applications because of
 the inconsistencies in the order of modifications to the file system."
He's talking about events *leading up to* a crash (after fsck has
succeeded).

Very very extreeeeeeemely marginally less safe, maybe... and even then
there's much room for debate -- FFS didn't get its nickname "Fast n'
Loose Filesystem" for nothing. :)
