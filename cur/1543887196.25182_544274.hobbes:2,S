It seems there is a:
late_initcall(wait_scan_init);
in drivers/scsi/scsi_wait_scan.c too. So we can get rid of the redundant:
#ifndef MODULE
late_initcal(scsi_complete_async_scans);
#endif
in drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c by enforcing SCSI_WAIT_SCAN=y when
SCSI=y (and =m when SCSI=m).
I guess this is probably the behaviour that James wanted originally?
Anyway, attached patch (subsumes previous one) cleans up all this.
Now, scsi_wait_scan is the only guy who controls waiting upon async
scans to complete:
If SCSI=n, SCSI_WAIT_SCAN=n, obviously.
If SCSI=y, SCSI_WAIT_SCAN=y, so it gets built-in and is run at
late_initcall.
If SCSI=m, SCSI_WAIT_SCAN=m too and would hopefully be run
by the initrd/initramfs scripts to wait for async SCSI bus scans to
finish before allowing the boot to proceed.
[ Attached patch does _not_ expose SCSI_WAIT_SCAN to the
user at kernel configuration time, so if somebody wants it to be
built as a module even when SCSI=y (why would anybody
want that, doesn't make much sense to me to modprobe
scsi_wait_scan _after_ boot-up), it would not be possible to
do so. But if someone really wants that, let me know, we can
add a depends, tristate "..." and help in this Kconfig option to
accomplish that too. ]
Thanks,
Satyam
