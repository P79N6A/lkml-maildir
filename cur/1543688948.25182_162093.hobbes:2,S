From a driver writers point of view, that's something I won't be using.
If I'm told to suspend, I better suspend.  If the driver model is calling
me out of sequence (because there are other children depending on me)
then it hasn't taken notice of my ordering requirements.
(Note - this bit isn't complete, but then the new model is no worse off
than the old model at present with respect to that issue.  The new model
does provide the interfaces to allow drivers to specify these dependencies
though.)

I've no idea what the PPC problem exactly was.  It's up to the PPC guys
to speak up *now*.
