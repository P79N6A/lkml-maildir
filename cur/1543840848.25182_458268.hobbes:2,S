I dont' know if it is a better idea - but I have been trying to
experiment with some token-based system where task-groups run until
exhausted out of their tokens. Of course, this will be work-conserving
in the sense that expired task-groups continue running if there arent
others who want to use their share. Token are renewed at periodic
intervals. I believe that is how vserver scheduler works (though havent
looked at their code).
And I was thinking of using something similar to smpnice for
load-balance purposes.
The main point here is that scheduling next-task-group decision is local
to each CPU (very similar to how next-task is picked up currently), with
some load-balance code expected to balance tasks/task-groups across all
CPUs.
In what Kirill is proposing, this "scheduling next-task-group decision"
on each CPU perhaps takes a global view and because of the
physical/virtual CPU separation, any CPU can be running any other CPU's
tasks (smp_processor_id/get_cpu etc now returning virtual CPU number rather than
the actual CPU on which they are running). Kirill is that description correct?
