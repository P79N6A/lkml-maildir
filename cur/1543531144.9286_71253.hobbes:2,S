In the quota case, in order to prevent a system-wide OOM you must give
each of N users an average of 1/N of the total system memory (ignoring
kernel overhead). The side effect is that overcommittment is now
impossible, because the system can only be overcommitted if a user has
exceeded their quota, which is not allowed...
Unless you don't count COW pages against a user's quota?
