Ok, let's assume it was the wake_up_process() in handle_stop_signal(), 
then hopefully this (totally untested) patch should fix it.
Roland, does this look sane to you? It makes the STOP wakeup be a 
SIGCONT-only thing, and makes the wakeup conditional on !PF_EXITING.
It also makes SIGKILL ignore the stopped status for delivery.
Does this make the gdb test-suite happy?
