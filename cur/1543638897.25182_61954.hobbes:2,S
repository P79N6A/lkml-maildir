I assume 4 byte ints, because I assume that the length of a 32 bit
bitfield will be 32 bits. As for alignment, you're correct. 
I guess my question becomes: is the original code defined in any
special way, in regards to padding and size? If it isn't, my __pad
patch would be cleaner and just as correct in principle. If it is, I
can make a __pad which will behave exactly the same way. 
Thanks, Muli.
