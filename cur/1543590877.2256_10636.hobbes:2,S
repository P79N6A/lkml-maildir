1. In .config, change CONFIG_EXT2_FS to 'm'
2. change "ext2" to "newfs" at DECLARE_FSTYPE_DEV in super.c
3. make modules SUBDIRS=fs/ext2
4. insmod fs/ext2/ext2.o
Poof!  New filesystem.  (cat /proc/filesystems) Don't forget to change 
ext2 in .config back to "y" before you build your next kernel.  You'll 
need to study the kernel *hard* before you can expect to have half a 
chance of having your filesystem work properly.  Go here:
