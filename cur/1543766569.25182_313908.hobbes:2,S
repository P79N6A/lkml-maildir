Hello,
i tried to install a 2.6.12-rc2-mm3 kernel with bttv support and 
after restarting the machine, i got something like this:
bttv0: PLL 28636363 => 35469950 .. ok
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer ...
Call trace:
msp 3400_init_module
do_init_calls
init
init
init
kernel_thread_helper
kernel_thread_helper
If i build the bttv support as a module and doing a modprobe bttv when
the system is up, it loads without problems.
And second one:
Of course the nvidia-kernel module does not work right with the 2.6.12-
rc2-mm3 kernel. I can modprobe it, but if i try to start the X-Server,
it tells me, that it is unable to load the kernel module (allthough it
is allready loaded)
Kind regards
Florian Engelhardt
