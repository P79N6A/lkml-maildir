It should be dropped I think ...
Different folks found that changing different settings fixed it for
them, so it looks like some kind of internal race in the North bridge
where changing the timings in any way makes it harder to reproduce.
The updated BIOS from Asus definitely fixes it for me, and "PCI Master
Read Caching" is *enabled*. There are quite a few differences in the
setup of the North bridge from the previous BIOS to this one, and I
assume the changes were suggested by VIA.
If there are other people out there who still have this problem we can
probably come up with a patch for the kernel, but isolating which of the
settings are important would be a long job.
Shame VIA won't help :-(
