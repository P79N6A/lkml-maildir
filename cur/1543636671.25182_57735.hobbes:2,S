A completely user-level solution may have some disadvantages, though,
such as delays in scheduling on/off (say if some daemon is used to
scan the process list). Perhaps we could add a small hack to the
scheduler such that when a task is about to be scheduled off, a signal
can be sent to a designated pid? Similarly, when a task is scheduled
on, another signal may be sent. An application that wanted to have
gang scheduling could then make use of this to STOP/CONT threads.
