You probably should use a 1.1.2 egcs with the sparc fixes (I use the version
in the redhat 6.0 erratas).

void rpc_clnt_sigunmask(struct rpc_clnt *clnt, sigset_t *oldset)
{
        unsigned long   irqflags;
        
        spin_lock_irqsave(&current->sigmask_lock, irqflags);
        current->blocked = *oldset;
        recalc_sigpending(current);
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&current->sigmask_lock, irqflags);
}
If there is enough RAM then some of it gets mapped below 0xf0000000. 
current->sigmask_lock ended up in this area of RAM. (0xeeb2066c)

This worries me. I haven't been able to test hypersparcs or large RAM
configurations while working on sparc32 SMP. Perhaps there is a problem
in one of them.

I would think that f0153994 is kernel_flag

No problem here. It is the other lock that is causing the trouble.
