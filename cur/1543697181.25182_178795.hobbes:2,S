Hmm. I don't see anything. However, it's a lot easier to read the
gcc-generated assembly ("make arch/i386/kernel/vm86.s") than it is to read
the objdump disassembly.
It's also a lot easier to see what the assembly language is when giving 
the
	-fno-reorder-blocks
switch to gcc. Without it, modern gcc's tend to have _way_ too many jumps 
around. But maybe that actually changes the behaviour too.
