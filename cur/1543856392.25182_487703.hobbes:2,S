I'll take it out.

To do this do I call usb_register_dev twice with different endpoint
info in the usb_ljusb struct that I pass in the probe function?
This could work, though it is preferred that the second node's
numbering is +1 of the first.  So for example, the first node for the
first set of endpoints would be ljusb0 and second endpoint would be
ljusb1.  Though now that I think about it a global mutex should help
with that.
Someone pointed out to me that there is the possibility of using the
libusb library as opposed to having a kernel driver, which would be
preferable.  I will need to test this library to see if it what I am
looking for and is stable enough, and if all goes well I might not
need to submit this kernel driver.
Thanks,
David
