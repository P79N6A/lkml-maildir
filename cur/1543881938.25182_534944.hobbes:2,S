Not the same... but they are still related. "freeze" (for atomic
snapshot) is actually subset of "suspend"... freeze needs DMAs off and
saved state, and you need DMAs off and saved state for "suspend".
So it is actually correct to do "suspend" when you want "freeze"; it
is just slow. That's why they only differ in parameter these days.

Lets call this "freeze"?

As I tried to explain, you can use suspend() to stop DMAs and save
state, and that's enough to get sane snapshot. (You do cli() before
doing snapshot, that helps with irqs).

Ok ok, we can do
suspend(PMSG_SUSPEND) -> suspend()
suspend(PMSG_FREEZE) -> freeze()
. We'll need to do big search&replace over the kernel etc. But if you
think it helps with confusion...
I'd still like to keep people using same method for both. It means
suspend path gets more testing, even when some stuff it does is not
strictly neccessary for freeze.
