how could it possibly be? Linus has simply replied to your point:

Linus observed that the only possible purpose of the code you cited, 
busy-looping, makes no sense.
If you dont intend to busy-loop, why does the code above look like a 
busy-loop, and what do you need the volatile keyword for?

your position here does seem to make much sense to me, so please help me 
understand it. You suggest that the assembly code should be left alone. 
But then why do you need the volatile keyword to begin with?

you seem to be quite self-confident. That is a nice thing to have for 
say a pro boxer, but it can be a disadvantage when dealing with a 
complex OS. Just curious, if you turn out to be wrong will you apologize 
for wasting Linus' (and others') time and for insulting him like that? 
(Or is this a totally impossible scenario not even worth discussing?)

here Linus claims that 'volatile' is useless and that the use of 
'volatile' is almost always a sign of bugs. That includes your 
code-samples too. So a proper answer on a technical forum like lkml 
would _not_ be to ignore Linus' point like you did, but to answer it 
directly. There are a couple of ways to answer it:
- you could explain why your sample code _does_ make sense. That's a 
  powerful way of making your point and you'll sure see an answer 
  either rebutting your point or conceding the point.
- or if you know that it makes no sense (minor nit: in which case you 
  should have pointed that out when writing them) then you could either
  correct it, or cite actual kernel code to which your point applies.
- an even better (and by far my most favorite) method of reply would be 
  if you sent an actual kernel patch (ontop of 2.6.18-rc1 plus my 
  volatile-removal patch) that implements your suggestions! That
  would be a perfect way of making your point - one line of patch is 
  worth a thousand words.
