drivers/net/Space.c also has a setup like this which should also be

I think a better approach for drivers or any other part which is
currently able to be compiled as a module would be to modify the module
interface to also work when compiled into the kernel, using similar
linking tricks.  This way there would be one object that can be
insmod'ed or directly linked into the kernel with the linker doing all
the magic.  This would remove the dependency on CONFIG_MODULE for many
files.  Also the parameter passing would be consistent between the boot
command line and insmod.
