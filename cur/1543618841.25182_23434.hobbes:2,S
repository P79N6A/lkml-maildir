Those are all reports of server bugs.
The first says that you are receiving read packets that are reported
to be longer than they actually are. This is harmless, since the RPC
layer automatically truncates any packets that threaten to overflow
our buffers.
The second is a report from the RPC layer. The server is saying that
you are trying to use an RPC service that it doesn't support.
The third states that your server is returning seriously screwed up
file attributes: even the fileid (a.k.a. inode number) is changed.
None of the above errors can cause a client to hang, however I suggest
that you try upgrading/patching your server.
Cheers,
