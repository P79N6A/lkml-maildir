Before using pte_wrprotect() the vma_wrprotect() routine uses the
pte_offset_map_lock() macro to get the PTE and to acquire the ptl
spinlock. Why did you say that this code was not SMP-safe? It should
be atomic, I think.

Neither the dirty flag you suggest, nor the AS_MCTIME flag I've
introduced in my previous solutions solve the following problem:
- mmap()
- a write reference
- msync() with MS_ASYNC
- a write reference
- msync() with MS_ASYNC
The POSIX standard requires the ctime and mtime stamps to be updated
not later than at the second call to msync() with the MS_ASYNC flag.
Some other POSIX-compliant operating system such as HP-UX and FreeBSD
satisfy this POSIX requirement. Linux does not.
