Yes, sparse warning.

Well, in an X86_32 allyesconfig, this only trips 32 times...so it's not
exactly common.  I agree that there is nothing _wrong_ with this, I'll
just add Linus and see if we can just call it codingstyle ;)
This is just a _trivial_ way to make the sparse output easier for people
to use day-to-day for the kernel. There's lots more to do, but this set
removes all remaining integer as NUll/ returning void-value/ single bit
signed bitfield warnings.
