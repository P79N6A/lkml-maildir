This patch lets BT_HIDP depend on instead of select INPUT.
This fixes the following warning during an s390 build:
<--  snip  -->
...
net/bluetooth/hidp/Kconfig:4:warning: 'select' used by config symbol 
'BT_HIDP' r
efer to undefined symbol 'INPUT'
...
<--  snip  -->
A dependency on INPUT also implies !S390 (and therefore makes the 
explicit dependency obsolete) since INPUT is not available on s390.
The practical difference should be nearly zero, since INPUT is always 
set to y unless EMBEDDED=y (or S390=y).
