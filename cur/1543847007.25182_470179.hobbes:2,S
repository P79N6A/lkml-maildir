One more thing you could to try if you can spare the time:
Build and boot Linux _2.6.18_ after applying this patchkit:
http://me.in-berlin.de/~s5r6/linux1394/updates/
This is only little more of 1394 stuff than what is now in 2.6.19-rc1.
This test would at least give a hint if changes sent via the linux1394
git tree are the culprit, or some change from outside.
In case you are familiar with quilt, take the quilt variant of the
patchkit instead of the collapsed patch. Short instructions on the
patchkits are on the website. The quilt patchset would allow to hunt
down the bad patch by bisection --- if the bad one is among the 1394
updates in the first place.
