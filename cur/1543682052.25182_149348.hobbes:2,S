You are an optimist.
My transition is much slower - I am a slow kind of person.
There is no flag day. The kernel must be updated, glibc must be
updated, user space software must be updated. A long process
that will take years. Indeed, so far we have not succeeded in
updating the kernel, and eight years went by.
Filesystems? Last I looked reiserfs handled 32 bits.
Really, we need the three stages - if the middle 32-bit stage
is absent too much software breaks. We must go forward slowly.
