enumerate_dma_channels() is still broken, if it can not fail add NOFAIL
gfp flag.
And you play tricky games with common_node/device_node of struct
dma_chan - one of that lists is never protected, while other is called 
under RCU and other locks (btw, why does insertion use RCU and deletion
in dma_async_device_unregister() does not?).
struct ioat_dma_chan - is it somewhere freed?
