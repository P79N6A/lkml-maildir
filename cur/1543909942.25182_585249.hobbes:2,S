RFC 1122, section 4.2.3.6 - 
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1122.html
"
         4.2.3.6  TCP Keep-Alives
            Implementors MAY include "keep-alives" in their TCP
            implementations, although this practice is not universally
            accepted.  If keep-alives are included, the application MUST
            be able to turn them on or off for each TCP connection, and
            they MUST default to off.
            Keep-alive packets MUST only be sent when no data or
            acknowledgement packets have been received for the
            connection within an interval.  This interval MUST be
            configurable and MUST default to no less than two hours.
