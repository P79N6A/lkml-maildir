Ok. That's the missing piece. The thing is wrong, but we don't care, 
because even if gcc saves the old values for some silly reload, they're 
dead and uninteresting.
Ok. I did the silly one-liner, but if the "don't care" approach really 
improves code generation, feel free to send one that fixes both the P5 and 
PII cases..
