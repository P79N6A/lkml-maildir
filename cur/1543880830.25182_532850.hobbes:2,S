Stephen,
From your description of the problem, it sounds just like writes to
PCI memory-mapped address space are being delayed and/or reordered in
the processor when in x86-64 mode.
I'd suggest to add wmb()/rmb() or (overkill) mb() calls after MMIO
stores to flush writes immediately and force give the intended
ordering; often drivers will issue a dummy read, which flushes writes
(but is far less efficient than a 'wmb', due to the PCI bus
read-latency). Also, if a PCI MMIO page is marked write-combining, the
processor will delay writes and burst them in up to 64-byte blocks,
which can be very good for getting maximal performance, but needs
careful considerations.
On the ia64 platform, the maximum time MMIO writes can be waiting in
the processor's write buffers, is something of the order of 2uS (!),
and MMIO store semantics are out-of-order, so read/write barriers are
critical.
Thanks,
  Dan
