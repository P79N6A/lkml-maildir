Yes, there is.  We can just use the PIT for udelay - it might not be
optimal on SMP but it seems to work here.
Pavel, does it work for you ?  It should report 2.38 BogoMIPS (PIT
clock is 1.193 MHz) regardless of the power management mode you're
in.
If it works, changing it to use __setup to determine which method to
use should be trivial.
