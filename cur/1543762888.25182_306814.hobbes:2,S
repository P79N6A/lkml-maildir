I am trying to set the SCHED_FIFO  policy for my process.I am using 
sched_setscheduler() function to do this.
I am following the correct syntax and running it as root process.I am using 
the given syntax i.e.,
int sched_setscheduler(pid_t pid, int policy, const struct sched_param *p);
(SCHED_FIFO for the policy and priority in the range of 1 to 99 for p).
But the function returns with an value of -1. I am trying to call this 
function from the user-space.
1) Is this usage correct?
2)How do I read the error code (i.e., text description of what kiind of 
error occurred like for eg., ESRCH,EPERM,EINVAL).
Please help.
thanks
Arun
