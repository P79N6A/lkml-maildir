Note that XFS and possibly other filesystem don't store the NULL
termination on disk.  So having a follow_link interface that uses a
counted string would be a nice little optimization for the XFS
follow_link / readlink implementation.   But I'm not really sure it's
worth complicating the VFS for that little gem.
