I think it would be very sensible to drop both System.map and a
Makefile fragment in /lib/modules/<version>/
Or perhaps the Makefile fragment should be put in linux/include/linux,
together with the header files of the kernel. That would make even
more sense.
So create a patch, submit it to Linus, see if it gets applied ;)
