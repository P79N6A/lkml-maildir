Hi,
Was just wondering if the _var_ in kfree(_var_) could be set to NULL after its freed. It may solve
the problem of accessing some freed memory as the kernel will crash since _var_ was set to NULL.
Does this make sense? If yes, then how about renaming kfree to something else and providing a
kfree macro that would do the following:
#define kfree(x) do { \
                      new_kfree(x); \
                      x = NULL; \
                    } while(0)
There might be other better ways too.
Regards,
Amit
