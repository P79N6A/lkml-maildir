What exactly are you measuring?  Linear read/write, like copying one
device to another (or to /dev/null), in large chunks?
I don't think it's an interesting test.  Hint: how many times a day
you plan to perform such a copy?
(By the way, for a copy of one block device to another, try using
O_DIRECT, with two dd processes doing the copy - one reading, and
another writing - this way, you'll get best results without huge
affect on other things running on the system.  Like this:
 dd if=/dev/onedev bs=1M iflag=direct |
 dd of=/dev/twodev bs=1M oflag=direct
)
