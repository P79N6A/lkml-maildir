Actually SiByte IDE seems to be broken even in linux-mips CVS since
at least 5 months due to this change:
http://www.linux-mips.org/cvsweb/linux/include/asm-mips/ide.h.diff?r1=1.23&r2=1.24
which causes conflicts between swarm.c private ide_init_default_hwifs() hack
and the one from <asm/mach-generic/ide.h> (I can't find other ide.h).
