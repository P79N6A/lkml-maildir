Nothing -- it's for parport internals only, and it's not actually even
used any more.  The only flag for parport_register_device at the moment is
PARPORT_DEV_EXCL.

Normally, you put parport_claim at the beginning of a data transfer that
cannot be interrupted, and parport_release at the end.

You ought to, yes.  It will set up the port's 'current device driver',
which some of the functions in port->ops rely on.
You should probably call parport_claim just after parport_register_device
succeeds.
