Its a minor thinko - <linux/types.h> is the right definition.

Sure, it is a convention that only a committee could love.
But it is at least widely understood by userspace programmers.

Fine for internal to the kernel. Absolutely. Required knowledge to play
with the kernel.

This is where we disagree. __u8 requires the (userspace) programmer
to go off, find out that __u8 is really some wierd Linux-ism that he
can safely map to uint8_t, to use with the rest of the *standard* library
routines.

Please don't be hasty.
This isn't about the kernel representation. It is about making ABIs as
easy as possible for userspace programmers to use. If there is an
ugly but standard way, and an almost-as-ugly and non-standard way,
I don't think that the standard way is too much to ask.
