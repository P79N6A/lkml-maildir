Hi, and thanks again.

If I intepret this correctly, that does not be the case:
Kernel symbols from
c0100000 A _text
to
c0232328 A _end
and a bunch of module symbols from
c8a5b04c T VMX86_RegisterMonitor
to
c8a909a4 D idescsi_template
All the modules starting c8a and kernel symbols c0. Nothing starts with
c5...

No ;).

ksymoops gave ~700 warnings like this:
Warning: ksyms_base symbol vsprintf_Rsmp_13d9cea7 not found in System.map.
Ignoring ksyms_base entry
and a couple of these:
Warning in compare_ksyms_lsmod, module es1370 is in lsmod but not in
ksyms, probably no symbols exported
Is that serious?
I'm a little surprised if nobody else is seeing this. The common
denominators with me and my friend (who had this with mpg123) are esd and
es1370. Kernel version varies from 2.2.11 (and earlier in case of my
friend) to 2.2.14.
