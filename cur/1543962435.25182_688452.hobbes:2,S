Yes, there is some amount of bugs that I see only on specific architecture.
These which are reproducible or have an easy test case I do report to LKML, but
there are also bugs I see rarely or just once and they never come back and sometimes
as a bonus leave no trace - and these I ususaly don't report. Providing a test case
is a challenge and one can really learn a lot.

What I meant was one box per architecture, preferably an SMP one where possible - so
the number of required boxes is limited. This way instead of just cross-compiling
I could actually _run_ the kernel. On the other hand if some arch is close to be dead
and has no foreseable future then there is no point in testing it.
Also my thinking was that sometimes bugs from other (than x86) architectures can point to
some more generic problems. Well - I'll buy just a few more and that's it ;)

Can do.

Sounds like a plan - will look into that.
