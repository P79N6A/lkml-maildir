Hi Marcus,
A screen with blinking green blocks implies that your display is in text
mode, not in graphics mode.  I don't know what options you are using,
but have you tried using:
acpi_sleep=s3_mode
If the above does not work, also try
acpi_sleep=s3_bios,s3_mode
If it is still not working, you can add this to your suspend script:
vbetool vbemode set <VESA mode ID>
where VESA mode ID = "vga=" value - 512 (0x200)
Tony
PS: If your BIOS setup has an option to re-POST the graphics card on
resume, that is a big help.
