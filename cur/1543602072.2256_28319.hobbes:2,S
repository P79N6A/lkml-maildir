Hello,
    can you someone pleas explain me what is behind a change of handling
noexec mount flag in recent ac series?
In Linus tree when VFAT filesystem is mounted with noexecall files except
directories have their exec flag cleared. In ac series is set. Files are not
runnable so internal handling of noexec is OK.
Petr
P.S.: CC me as I'm not on the list.
