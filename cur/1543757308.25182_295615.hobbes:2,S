The most interesting fact seems to be that these spam messages have the 
same message ID as the original Mails.
If you run a program that automatically discards duplicate mails and the 
spam message reaches you faster than the original email through 
linux-kernel (which seems to often happen with these mails), the 
original email will be discarded. 
I don't know whether these are known attacks, but the automatic 
discarding of duplicated emails offers attackers nice opportunities if 
they know a message ID (as with these emails) or can guess the
message ID (since many MUAs have predictable message IDs, an attacker C
could use this to suppress a message from person A to person B by 
sending an email with the message ID to person B bevor person B gets 
the email from person A).
