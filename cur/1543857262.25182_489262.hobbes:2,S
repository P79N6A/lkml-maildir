 I tested it in the evening with the system I implemented it for 
originally.  It seems to work -- it does not oops as would the original 
code without the call to flush_scheduled_work() nor does it deadlock as 
would code with the call (and no special precautions).
 Thanks a lot (and congrats for still being capable of doing something 
else from merging).
