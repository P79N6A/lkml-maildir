If so, please enlighten me as to when, why, and what for you would use sched_yield.
If willingly and knowingly relinquinshing a CPU does not make it possible
for other processes to use what would otherwise have been your very own slice
of processing time then what could it be used for, I really wonder.
Second, I have tried to run my misconception on various other OS'es I have
access to:Win2k, Mac OSX and OpenBSD, and suprinsingly enough, all of them
seem to be sharing my twisted views of How Things Should Be (tm).
