I noticed some areas are well maintained because there is an awesome
maintainer, or good and well coordinated team - and this is mostly in
the "fun" areas ;) But there are "boring" areas that are about to be
deprecated or no new development expected etc. It will be hard to get
a dedicated person to take care of such. How about having people on
rotation, or jury duty so to speak - for a period of time (completely
voluntary!) Nice stats on the report about contributions in non-native
areas for a developer would be great accomplishment and also good
chance to look into other things! Besides, this way "old parts" will
get attention to be be revised and re-implemented sooner. And we can
post "Temp maintainer needed" list...
