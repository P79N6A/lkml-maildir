Subject: Possible race in interruptible_sleep_on_timeout()

I lifted the following kernel-thread code from
../linux/drivers/net/8139too.c, just added a procedure to call.
static int gpib_thread(void *unused)
{
    unsigned long timeout;
    daemonize();
    spin_lock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
    sigemptyset(&current->blocked);
    recalc_sigpending(current);
    spin_unlock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
    memcpy(current->comm, task_name, sizeof(task_name));
    for(;;)
    { 
        timeout = 0x02;
        do {
           timeout = interruptible_sleep_on_timeout(&info->twait, timeout);
           } while (!signal_pending(current)&&(timeout > 0)); 
        if(signal_pending(current))
            up_and_exit(&info->quit, 0);
        tinker(info->what_to_do);
    } 
}
It has been observed that, given the conditions of little or no
CPU activity except `top`,  procedure "tinker()" will never get
executed because interruptible_sleep_on_timeout returns the
same timeout value it received. 
This is on kernel version 2.4.1. Maybe this race has been found and
fixed?
Cheers,
