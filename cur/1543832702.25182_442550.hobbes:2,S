Andrew,
Another patch from Alexey Kuznetsov fixing memory leak in alloc_fdtable().
[PATCH] fdset's leakage
When found, it is obvious. nfds calculated when allocating fdsets
is rewritten by calculation of size of fdtable, and when we are
unlucky, we try to free fdsets of wrong size.
Found due to OpenVZ resource management (User Beancounters).
