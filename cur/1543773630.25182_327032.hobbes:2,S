It usualy generates shorter binary, because there's no pointer variable.
Doesn't seem so in this case:
	   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
before:	   2333     389       8    2730     aaa kernel/power/disk.o
after:	   2349     389       8    2746     aba kernel/power/disk.o
static const char[] makes it same, so no real gain there either :-(
Sorry for the noise.
