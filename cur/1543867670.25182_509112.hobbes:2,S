That's nonsense.  They are widely used (just hear people scream if
something changes or breaks) and they are available on all Unix
implementations which are not geared towards embedded use.  POSIX makes
AIO in the next revision mandatory.
Just because you don't like it, don't discount it.  Yes, the interface
is not the best.  But this is what you get if you cannot dictate
interfaces to everybody.  You have to make concessions.
