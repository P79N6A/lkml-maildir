Other people with similar problems reported that the attached patch from 
  Gerd Knorr fixed the problem for them.
If you try it out and it fixes the problem for you, don't forget to 
report the fix in bugzilla too, so that others can use that info (and 
prevent having open bugs there for things that are already fixed :).
I hope this helps,
