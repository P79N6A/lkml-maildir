Again, I have to ask, which reads are you interfering with?  Ones that 
haven't happened yet?  Remember, the disk is idle.  So *at worst* you are 
going to get one extra seek before getting hit with the tidal wave of reads 
you seem to be worried about.  This simply isn't significant.
I've tested this, I know early writeout under light load is a win.
What we should be worrying about is how to balance reads against writes under 
heavy load.
