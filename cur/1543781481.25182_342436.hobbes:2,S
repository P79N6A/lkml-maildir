Ehm, I did not know there was still an OSS usb driver.
I have:
Module                  Size  Used by
snd_usb_audio          71936  1
snd_usb_lib            13568  1 snd_usb_audio
snd_rawmidi            20448  1 snd_usb_lib
snd_hwdep               7008  1 snd_usb_audio
yealink                11072  0
and playback is working fine on 2.6.13-rc6.
Today we create the legacy of tomorrow ;).
