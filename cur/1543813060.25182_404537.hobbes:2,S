Likely...

memory barrier functions have to be targeted to the processor with the 
ability to do the widest amount of reordering. This is the Itanium AFAIK.

i386 does not fully implement things like write barriers since they have 
an implicit ordering of stores.

F.e. spin_unlock has "release" semantics on IA64. That means that prior 
write accesses are visible before the store, read accesses are also 
completed before the store. However, the processor may perform later read 
and write accesses before the results of the store become visible.
