Wayne, everybody..
I hate to belabor this point, but I'm in full agreement.  If I really 
believed that Alan's boycott would have *any* positive affect, I'd fully 
support it, but the reality of the situation is that Wayne is right -- nobody 
with any real power will ever know or be able to a difference.  I think that 
civil disobiediance is the only sensible action.
