I think it's the right approach, too, and the patch seems ok to me.  I've 
applied it to 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jmorris/security-testing-2.6#next
and expect to push it to Linus in the next day or so.  It's not a trivial 
change, and could do with more review (Serge?).
It seems that more testing should be done in linux-next vs. waiting for 
the merge window.
