I had been seeing something similar (also with 2.6.19.2), but it's not
outputting anything to dmesg, so I was waiting for something to happen
before I reported it. It's mostly the same thing, but I've only seen
it happen when copying something large (2+ GB) over NFS. Interactivity
completely goes away and lockups last 10-15 seconds a piece. Then
realized I turned the swap off, so I turned it on and didn't lockup
any longer.
