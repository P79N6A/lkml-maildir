   I haven't seen this mentioned yet but the new
pre3 changes remove the typedef of urb_t and purb_t
from include/linux/usb.h. This causes alas-drivers
0.9.0rc3 to fail to compile. I wanted to find out
if this removal of urb_t and purb_t was 
final or if it would be regressed back in pre4?
Thanks for any information.
