 Thanks, I also verified the manual and it states that this card is 
 running 10Mbps at it's max even when in 100baseT mode. It's just
 a compatibility feature. Will have to complain about that, it's quite
 annoying to order a dual bandwitdh ethernet card and get such a crappy
 and power consuming (nice feature in winter, just take it out of the
 slot and put it into your pocket... :/ ) 16 bit card....
