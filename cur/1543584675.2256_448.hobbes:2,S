Nope. I didn't have anything to do with the way an
initial ramdisk is implemented either. However, here
is the point at which the root file system gets changed
from the initrd file-system to the real root.
This is `dmesg` stripped down:
 sda: sda1 sda2 < sda5 >
SCSI device sdb: 4406960 512-byte hdwr sectors (2256 MB)
 sdb: sdb1 sdb2
SCSI device sdc: 17783240 512-byte hdwr sectors (9105 MB)
 sdc: sdc1 sdc2 sdc3
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
change_root: old root has d_count=3  < ============= Note the count!
Freeing unused kernel memory: 80k freed
At one time d_count meant something. Then there were changes.
Then more changes. This might have something to do with the
dangling references that can kill.
The `mount` command, nor its internal mount(2) doesn't enter into
this at all. There were no command-scripts that executed the
change_root. This is all part of the built-in initial RAM Disk
capabilites.
The problem is, simply, once you have booted a system using the
RAM Disk, don't expect to ever use the RAM disk again. Writes
to this, even though not currently mounted, can (will) make a mess
of your file-systems, even those which are not mounted.
This is simply a bug that should be fixed. It's not somebody
trying to do something for which the system was not designed.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
