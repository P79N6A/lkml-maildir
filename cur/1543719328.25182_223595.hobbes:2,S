Hmm. This message seems to be from arch/arm26/lib/kbd.c
Is this message from 2.6.6? Is this an ARM?

Your report is a bit messy. You change things for scancode 0x71 and then
expect the keycode for 0x70 to be changed?

Given a careful and precise report, no doubt it will be clear
what your situation is. Mention architecture, scancodes under 2.4,
scancodes under 2.6.

[The situation with arch/arm26/lib/kbd.c is funny.
That is the old keyboard code that was removed from
the general kernel code. No doubt it should be updated.]
