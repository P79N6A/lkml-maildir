and i thought you understood this point, as earlier versions of 
checkpatch.pl were carefully filtering out _known nontrivial_ code, such 
as the barrier APIs (smp_rmb(), etc.) where we know that they are 
nontrivial in _100%_ of the cases.
trying to warn about code that 'might' be unclean is a catastrophy. This 
tool should only make noise if it is _really_ sure that there's 
something wrong going on. If the tool cannot make an intelligent 
decision about it then it should be silent!
Btw., there's an easy solution for v0.08's many breakages: turn off the 
WARNING output by default and rename it to 'INFO' or something other 
non-alarming.
