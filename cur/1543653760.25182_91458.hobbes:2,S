The only reference I was able to find was in the Intel Technology Journal,
which says the L2 cache has a 128 byte cache line.
http://developer.intel.com/technology/itj/q12001/articles/art_2.htm
-> "Netburst microarchitecture" -> Level 2 Instruction and Data Cache
"The L2 cache is organized as an 8-way set-associative cache with 128 bytes 
per cache line. These 128-byte cache lines consist of two 64-byte sectors. 
A miss in the L2 cache typically initiates two 64-byte access requests to the 
system bus to fill both halves of the cache line. The L2 cache is a write-back 
cache that allocates new cache lines on load or store misses. "
It is refering to the older 256K cached P4, but I doubt they changed it.
Your cache reporting may refer to the 64byte sectors or is just wrong
(would not be the first time that has happened - some P4 versions also
misreported their TLB size) 
For cache colouring purposes you need to use the 128 byte unit.
