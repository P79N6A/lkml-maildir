In order to try to figure out what the boot medium was.  For some boot 
loaders, like grub, it could be more or less anything, but others, e.g. 
syslinux, knowing what the boot loader is lets you know what the medium was.

No, that was a separate patch I submitted several weeks ago which was 
apparently still in that tree.  Would be good to get that patch into the 
tree, though; it allows an x86-64 setup to compile an i386 kernel with 
only make ARCH=i386.
