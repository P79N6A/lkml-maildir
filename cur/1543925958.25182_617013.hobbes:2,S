For a 64-bit load, you'll always have a REX prefix.  For 8-, 16- and 
32-bit load, the length of the instruction will depend on the register 
chosen, unless you constrain to either all legacy or all upper 
registers, or you force gas to generate a prefix, but I don't think 
there is a way to do that that will work with assemblers all the way 
back to 2.12, which is at least what we officially support (I have no 
idea if assemblers that far back actually *work*, mind you.)
