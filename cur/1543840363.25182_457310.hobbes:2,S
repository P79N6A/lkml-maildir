Subject: [PATCH 0/2] - more ext3 16T fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

These two patches address a few more issues when using 16T ext3 filesystems on 
32-bit systems.
These are based in large part on the work Takashi Sato did earlier[1] - I tried 
to distill out just the large filesystem fixes, leaving large files for later.
These apply on top of fix-ext3-mounts-at-16t.patch already in the -mm tree
1: Fix one more overflow in reservation code (plus cosmetic changes) and test 
   for overflows when resizing
2: Treat all inode numbers as unsigned longs - fix formats and a couple of types
If these pass muster I'll send analogous patches for ext2.
