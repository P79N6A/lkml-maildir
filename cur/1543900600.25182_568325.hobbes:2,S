great! We had the upstream -rt port to .22 in the works too, it was just 
held up by the hpet breakage - which Thomas managed to fix earlier 
today. I've released the 2.6.22.1-rt1 patch to the usual place:

I took a quick look at the delta between .22.1-rt1 and your rt1 merge, 
and the delta patch is quite large and i saw no obvious fixes to pick 
up. Could you please filter out any fixes that you might have in your 
tree that you think should be applied, and send it to us as a delta 
against .22.1-rt1? Alessio, could you please also do the same and check 
for any diffs that should be applied? Thanks!
(And, as Daniel suggested, in the future, could you _please_ use a 
different naming scheme instead of using up the upstream -rt namespace.)
