This makes CPU percentages stay aligned in column when some of them
reach 100%:

It also kills the 'states' part, things are beginning to spread past 80
columns...is it very important ?
I am gettin also strange outputs sometimes, with a ton of digits in decimal
parts. Sample before my patch:
CPU0 states:  0,0% user,  0,6% system,  0,0% nice,  4,1070653% iowait,  0,109% idle
CPU1 states:  0,1% user,  0,1% system,  0,0% nice,  4,1070653% iowait,  0,113% idle
And after:
CPU0:   0,12% user,   0,5% system,   0,0% nice,  99,1357% iowait,   0,489% idle
CPU1:   0,13% user,   0,15% system,   0,0% nice,  99,1357% iowait,   0,478% idle
