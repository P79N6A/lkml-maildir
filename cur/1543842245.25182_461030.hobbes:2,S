Thanks!  I'd appreciate it.  Don't hesitate to ask me if some
decisions I made are unclear.
I was about to write to you, in fact, since I wrote a version of my
patch which merges with the one you made (an old version, though, I
suppose: I took it from <URL: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/15/294

but I can try merging with more recent versions).  The point being to
show that my patch is not incompatible with yours: they are quite
complementary.  (The merged patch can be found in <URL:
ftp://quatramaran.ens.fr/pub/madore/newcaps/pre-alpha/

I agree that splitting CAP_SYS_ADMIN might be worth while, but it
really looks like opening a worm can, so I didn't feel up to the
challenge there.  It might be a good idea to reserve some bits for
that possibility, however - I'm not sure how best to proceed.

Yes, that sounds like a good idea.  I'll do that.
