You are right,both ways would cause confusion,but sooner or later we need to move it because our NICs onward are all Gigabit and 100M NICs will disappear gradually in the future. Probably H.Peter's suggestion that have a single list for 100M and 1000M is a better choice.

The forcedeth on my nforce2 board is 100Mbit.  I think the driver handles both 100Mbit and GBit type devices.  Makes for an interesting categorization problem.  Moving it would cause confusion.  Leaving it where it is could cause confusion.  Moving it may confuse existing users more though so I would recommend leaving it alone unless you can somehow make it appear in both.
