LEDS=n and LEDS_TIMER=y is a legal configuration if ARCH_EBSA110?
The LEDS_TIMER dependencies seem to be incorrect at least regarding 
ARCH_CDB89712.
Yes, it is ugly annd error-prone.

The current LEDS configuration is ugly, but that's not an ARM specific 
problem. Compare e.g. the big #if in include/linux/parport.h 30 lines 
before the end of the file in Linus' tree and see how this is resolved 
in -mm in non-pc-parport-config-change.patch .
One solution for LEDS would be to add a helper option HAS_LEDS that gets 
selected by the ARCH_* options if the platform supports LEDS, and LEDS 
simply depends on HAS_LEDS.
