Subject: [PATCH] viocons: BKL locking
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

For some weird reason I can't ascertain (translation "I think its
broken") the viocons driver calls directly into the n_tty ldisc code even
if another ldisc is in use. It'll probably break if you do that but I'm
just fixing the locking and adding a comment that its horked.
