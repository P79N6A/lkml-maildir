I was worrying about a corner cases. The new_esp can
be just everything. It can be < THREAD_SIZE, in which
case the limit_in_pages will be 0. Or, I beleive, it
can even be a negative value, which will turn into a
a value larger than the old_esp.
But after calculating a few examples, I have almost
convinced myself that your technique will work in all
such a cases. So I'll try that as soon as the new -mm's
will boot for me again.
