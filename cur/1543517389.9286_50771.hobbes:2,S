Thanks, Matti, but I meant "any ideas, except the obvious ones below":
a) moving some stuff into modules.
b) going through as many statically declared arrays as I can find and
reducig their sizes. This can help greatly, e.g. scripts/genkdbsym.awk has
the value 7500 hardcoded and my kernel had around 15000 symbols so I upped
the limit to 20000 realizing a minute later that it is much nicer to have
it just above the actual number - 20000 is too wasteful, I can fit an
extra network driver in that space :)
Regards,
Tigran.
PS. Also, did anyone make a hack to rc.sysinit (rh61-based) to live on a
readonly rootfs? I put something together yesterday evening (manipulating
"transparent" ramdisks for /dev /etc /var and such) but if someone has
done it better than me, I would like to know.
