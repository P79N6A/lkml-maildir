Last half-KB is useless, as filesystem on it is ext2 with 4KB blocks... 
Only problem is that previously stable system was now dying in e2fsck. I'll 
try to invent some solution before 2.6 ;-) 
Maybe fix to e2fsck would be sufficient, I always thought that it reads disk 
in blocksize (4KB) chunks, so disk will not see 512B request. But
apparently it either reads partition in 512B chunks, or block layer does not
do merging correctly.
