Hi,
I found the following lines in tcp.c, after trying to identify
and track down what I thought to be an nbd bug...
net/ipv4/tcp.c:
   1028       if (tcp_memory_free(sk))
   1029               skb = tcp_alloc_skb(sk, tmp, GFP_KERNEL)
While this looks ok at first glance, it rather conflicts with
the following lines of code from net/core/sock.c:
    785               skb = alloc_skb(try_size, sk->allocation);
And from drivers/block/nbd.c:
    109               sock->sk->allocation = GFP_ATOMIC;
......
    121               if (send)
    122                       result = sock_sendmsg(sock, &msg, size);
Here we see that the nbd driver sets the allocation type to
GFP_ATOMIC (and for a good reason), sock.c honours this field,
but for some reason tcp.c doesn't ...
Is this an actual bug, or am I overlooking something?
regards,
Rik
