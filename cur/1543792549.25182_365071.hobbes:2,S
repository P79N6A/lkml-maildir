Yeah, but if you're trying to read that code, you have to go look up
the declaration to figure out whether it might affect 'foo' or not.
And if you get it wrong, you get silent data corruption.
I'd rather pass a pointer explicitly and crash with a segfault if
someone passes NULL--at least then it's pellucidly clear what went
wrong.
