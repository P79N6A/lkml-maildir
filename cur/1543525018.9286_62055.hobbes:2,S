   First, Let me say that I think that the TTY layer doesn't help me as a
   driver writer enough: There is too much "administration" that a driver
   needs to do. For example, the whole "open" logic is now implemented
   again and again in every serial driver. 
Post-2.4 most of the open logic is GOING AWAY, along with the /dev/cua*
devices.  This will simplify the open logic immensely.  
I want to move the CD logic into the tty layer, both for blocking opens,
and for hangup processing.  Hangup processing will happen in a
bottom-half handler, and not in the middle of an interrupt, where all
sorts of races can happen.
   I think a driver should be responsible for talking to the hardware,
   and the "driving layer" should do the thinking.
Oh, agreed, 100%.  I just think the "driving layer" should be the tty
layer; we don't need another one. 
The basic idea is that we'll have some generic functions for interfacing
to physical devices (face it most tty devices are physical; pty and
console are the exceptions), which can be overriden by the driver if
they wish.
