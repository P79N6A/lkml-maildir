No, that is not possible. However, on plugging the mouse, /sbin/hotplug
will be called with appropriate arguments to allow to take any action
needed (symlinking, sending a signal, whatever) to make the mouse keep
working. Also a list of existing devices is available under
/proc/bus/input/devices for applications to look at and reconfigure in
case of a hotplug event.
