Linux is not 'being fixed', because I don't regard this as a bug - and
only bugs need fixing.
I don't want to have the NAT code to _always_ rewrite the IP ID because
of performance reasons.  I think we should leave the current behaviour
and provide an _optional_ 'IPID' target for the mangle table.  So
everybody who wants IP ID rewriting can use that target.
