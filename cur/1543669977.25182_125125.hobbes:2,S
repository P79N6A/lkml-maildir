Hi,
I need to get agpgart to work with a SiS 648 chipset and I
haven't seen any implementation of such yet.  I'm currently
using a 2.4.19 kernel.  Without a working implementation I
can't use accelerated OpenGL with an ATI Radeon 9500 pro
because the ATI drivers require working agp support.  I've
tried just using the generic-sis but that causes the driver
to mess up big time.
Any ideas?
Regards,
Tim Lee
