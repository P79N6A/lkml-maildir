Whee. Those are getting rare.
Anyway, it really looks like it's a _PCMCIA_ bridge, not a cardbus one, so
you can forget about the yenta module. Basically, "yenta" is for the newer
32-bit-capable Cardbus bridges (which do have an i82365 compatible legacy
mode), and i82365 is for the old legacy-_only_ 16-bit PCMCIA bridges.
It should be an i82365-compatible chip (they almost always are - it's
either yenta or i82365 in the normal case, and the others are for some
really odd-ball things or non-PC-compatibles).
It looks like you tried every single module _except_ for the i82365.
Give that one a whirl. Just "modprobe i82365"
