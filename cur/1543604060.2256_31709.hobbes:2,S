Subject: Truncated dmesg at boot up

I am seeing a weird problem, and have been for some time, where the
messages output to the console during boot up and truncated.  The first
few lines, always a different amount of lines, are always missing and
can not be seen by doing `dmesg` or `cat /var/log/dmesg`.  I have been
using the -ac branch exclusively and am currently using -ac with the
most up-to-date CVS ext3 -ac merge and Robert Love's most current
preempt patches.  Currently I am running 2.4.10-ac10 with the
2.4.7-ac7-ext3-0.9.12 branch of ext3 CVS to get me up to date with ext3
and also running the 2.4.10-ac10 set of preempt patches.  Here is the
begining of what is contained in both the output of `dmesg` and `cat
/var/log/dmesg`:

There used to be more information at the top and I do not know why
recently I have not been able to see this information anymore.  Thanks
to anyone who can help.
