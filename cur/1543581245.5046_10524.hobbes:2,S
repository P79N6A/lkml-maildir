Check your cables, especially the connector on the card and the drive.  Look
for any possible bent pins.  The message you are seeing is *usually*, but not
always, a legitimate data corruption issue.  It doesn't show up under the
5.2.1 driver because it limits your Quantum drive to 80MByte/s and that
particular speed doesn't include CRC checking.  On this driver you have to be
running at 160MByte/s before CRC checking is enabled.
