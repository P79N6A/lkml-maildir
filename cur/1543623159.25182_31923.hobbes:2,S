Hmm.  This would seem to be false in the RH 7.2 kernel 2.4.9-21
kernel I'm working with.
My IP masquerading rule (which claims to be in the "forward"
chain, with target "MASQ"), was blocked when I did input address
masking.
I.e. Yes, I actually tested this before posting.
If you're calling it a bug, then so be it.  But the result would be
a bit better than how my Linux system works now.
