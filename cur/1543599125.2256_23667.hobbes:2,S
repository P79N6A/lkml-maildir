You're streaming the mp3 over nfs, right?  From your setup I'd guess there's 
no local hard disk.

Uhuh.  Would you please look in your logs for "allocation failed" messages?
(Side note: reading the nfs code now... to whose eyes are names like tk_rqstp 
beautiful?)

Whoops, nothing inactive but kswap going full blast.  We're getting warmer.

Yes, a slight difference, however they are both wedged in the same way, from 
your task samples:

That's understandable.  Everything that needs to allocate memory is wedged.

How far back do you have to go before you get one that works?  I seem to 
recall the inactive_plenty changes came in at 2.4.8-pre1.  Could you try it 
with 2.4.7, please.
