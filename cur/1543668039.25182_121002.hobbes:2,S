   So what the test SHOULD look like is this:
   	if (gfp_mask & __GFP_WAIT) {
   		if (in_atomic() || irqs_disabled()) {
   			static int count = 0;
   			...
   		}
   	}
   
   which should catch all the cases we really care about.
Let's codify this "in_atomic() || irqs_disabled()" test into a macro
that everyone can use to test sleepability, ok?
