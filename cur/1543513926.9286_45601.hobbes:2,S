I am looking for a mechanism that enables a user process to
advise the kernel on a per-fd basis not to keep more than say
two pages of a certain file any buffer cache based on the
promise that the user process will read that file only in a
sequentially-forward or even non-seeking manner.  I exspect
performance improvements from such a mechanism because I
observed that unrelated user processes get paged out when a very
large file is passed thru a streaming application.
