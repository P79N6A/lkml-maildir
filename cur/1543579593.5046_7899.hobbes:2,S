One possible problem I can see here is to do with removal of RAID.  Think
of a RAID-1 array (2 or more disks containing identical data).  The
partition can be validly identified as an ext2 filesystem.  But wait, it
has a RAID superblock at the end.
How do we know if this superblock is current or not?  After all, a mke2fs
on the device won't remove it.  Yes, you could fill the partition with
zeros and start again, or you could just change the partition ID.
