turns out that i have another bug which causes a screaming IRQ#0 that 
floods the box at 70K irqs/sec. That is what triggered that crash in 
your patch most likely.
so either figure out the bug by review or try turning your IRQ#0 into a 
screaming one for debug purposes. (hint: turning irq#0's trigger mode 
from 'edge' to 'level' in mpparse.c or ioapic.c does wonders to that end 
;-)
