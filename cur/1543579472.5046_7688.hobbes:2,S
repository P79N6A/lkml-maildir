That's why I want to avoid dummy struct page and use a real mem_map
instead. I have two options:
1. I map everything together in one mem_map, like it's still done for
m68k, the overhead here is in the phys_to_virt()/virt_to_phys() function.
2. I use several nodes like mips64/arm and virt_to_page() gets more
complex, but this usually assumes a specific memory layout to keep it
fast.
Once that problem is solved, I can manage the memory on the card like the
main memory and use it however I want. I probably do something like ia64
and use the highest bits as an offset into a table.
bye, Roman
