	Hello,
	eth0 locked after 20-30 seconds stress test, different setups:
- SMP with 2 CPUs and 2 3c905B Cyclone 100baseTx cards
- SMP with 1 CPU (maxcpus=1) and the same 2 cards
	No eth lock problems with 2.2.19 UP
	The scenario, a throughput test setup:
flood -> eth0 -> forwarding -> eth1 -> victim
	The eth0 stops to respond, no oopses or problems with eth1.
The system is running. Note that eth0 is used only to receive the
flood. There is no much out traffic through eth0.
	If the forwarding is disabled there are no problems, i.e. the
traffic is received and dropped.
	The funny messages:
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
eth0: transmit timed out, tx_status 00 status e681.
  diagnostics: net 0cd8 media 8880 dma 0000003a.
eth0: Interrupt posted but not delivered -- IRQ blocked by another device?
  Flags; bus-master 1, dirty 123(11) current 123(11)
  Transmit list 00000000 vs. dfe7f4c0.
