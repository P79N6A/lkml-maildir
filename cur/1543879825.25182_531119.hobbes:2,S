Hello,
I am testing the 2.6.21-rc7 kernel release. The IDE hpt366 driver is crashing hanging the boot.
I have basically the same config as 2.6.20.7 which works fine (except for netconsole mentioned in
a previous mail).
here is the hand-copied info:
* "unable to handle paging request" , null deref
* EIP @ init_chipset_hpt366
init_setup_hpt302
htp366_init_one
ide_scan_pcidev
ide_scan_pcibus
ide_init
init
some hardware info:

I cannot get more information since netconsole is broken.
I am running a git-bisect to see if I can resolve it to a commit.
Cheers,
