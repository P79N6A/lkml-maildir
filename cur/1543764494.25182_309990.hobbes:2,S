That's true to some degree, but look at code like this (in 
drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c):

and compare to this:

> 			+ values * sizeof(unsigned), GFP_KERNEL);

In the first case you have to read carefully to make sure that the size 
argument in both the kmalloc and the memset are the same. Even more, if 
the size needs to be updated to include something more, a mistake can be 
made by inserting the extra size just in the kmalloc call. Also, you are 
assuming that the compiler is smart enough to notice that the two 
expressions are the same and cache the result, but this is probably true 
for gcc, anyway.
I think most will agree that the second piece of code is more "readable".

I was actually planning on sending a patch at a time for a reasonably 
sized subsection. Like "use kzalloc in usb/serial drivers", or "use 
kzalloc in sound/core", etc.
This way, it shouldn't be more than 1150 patches ;)

Yes it is. But at least it will remove 1000+ lines of redundant kernel code.
I really don't see this as a priority at all. I'll probably submit a 
patch shortly to create the kzalloc function. This way developers become 
aware that it exists and that it should be used, and we don't get a lot 
of new code with the same constructs.
The cleanup can then progress at a slowly pace, without breaking things 
and without producing too much merging problems.

I couldn't agree more :)

I've read that thread, but it seems that it is at a dead end right now, 
since we don't have a good tool to find out which functions are abusing 
the stack with unit-at-a-time.
Is there some way to even limit the search, like using a stack usage log 
from a compilation without unit-at-a-time, and going over the hotspots 
to check for problems?
If we can get a list, even if it contains a lot of false positives, I 
would more than happy to help out...
