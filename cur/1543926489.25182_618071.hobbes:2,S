I don't know where you got that idea.  Reread my last sentence above.
My concern is that your patch fixes one symptom (number of function
returns reported < number of function entries reported), but not the
root cause (we can fail to report some function returns).  If fixing one
symptom is the best we can do, then I have no real objection to that.
Of course, we need to keep in mind that you're adding an externally
visible feature that would need to be maintained, so it demands more
scrutiny than a simple bug fix.

entry_info is, by default, a zero-length array, which adds nothing to
the size of a uretprobe_instance -- at least on the 3 architectures I've
tested on (i386, x86_64, powerpc).

No, it doesn't.  Providing a feature isn't the same as forcing people to
use the feature.

Having ri available at function entry time is definitely a win, but
maintaining separate data structures and using ri to map to the right
one is no trivial task.  (It's a lot easier if you pre-allocate the
maximum number of data structures you'll need -- presumably matching
rp->maxactive -- but then you have at least the same amount of "bloat"
as with the data pouch approach.)
I suggest you show us a probe module that captures data at function
entry and reports it upon return, exploiting your proposed patch.
Profiling would be a reasonable example, but something where multiple
values are captured might be more relevant.  (Your example below doesn't
count because it doesn't work.)  Then I'll code up the same example
using your enhancement + the data pouch enhancement, and we can compare.
Of course, the data pouch enhancement would build nicely atop your
enhancement, so it could be proposed and considered separately.

No.  Handlers shouldn't be writing to the pt_regs struct unless they
want to change the operation of the probed code.  If an entry handler
scribbles on *regs and then decides to "abort", it's up to that handler
to restore the contents of *regs.  It's that way with all kprobe and
kretprobe handlers, and the proposed entry handler is no different, as
far as I can see.

Not for recursive calls.  Think about it.  Or write a little program
that calls a recursive function like factorial(), and have factorial()
report the value of __builtin_return_address(0) each time it's called.

If the probed function can sleep, then it could return on a different
CPU; a per-cpu flag wouldn't work in such cases.

NAK.  Saving and restoring regs is expensive and inconsistent with
existing kprobes usage.
