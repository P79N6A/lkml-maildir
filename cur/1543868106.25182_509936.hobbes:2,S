Does your system have hyperthreading? (look at whether the siblings field 
in /proc/cpuinfo is greater than one)
If yes, there is no way to accurately measure runtimes because the 
(single-threaded) performance of your CPU depends on the other tasks 
running. Just disable hyperthreading for these measurements.
