Subject: [BK PATCH] Driver core changes for 2.5.69
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
Here are three small changesets that fix up some stuff in the driver
class code.  They do the following:
	- restore back the driver link in the sysfs class representation
	  that I removed based on my previous class changes.
	- fix the cpu frequency code to work properly again (I messed up
	  when porting it to the new class code.)
	- remove an unneeded line in the class code.
Please pull from:  bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/class-2.5
thanks,
greg k-h
