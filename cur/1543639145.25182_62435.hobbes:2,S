Well let it be said that the 2.5.30 VM is by no means "Rik's
rmap VM".  It's the 2.4.15 VM with pte-chains bolted on the side,
and it's fairly sucky in several regards.
Until the big stuff is settled in (locking rework, per-zone LRU,
slablru, ...) there's not a lot of point trying to finetune
the 2.5.30 VM.
But a convincing demonstration of the advantages of the 2.4 rmap
patch would set a lot of minds at ease ;)
