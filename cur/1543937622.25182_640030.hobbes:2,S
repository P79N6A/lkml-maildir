What do you think of:
/*
 * (unsigned long)regs looks strange, but it's correct for x86_32.  x86_32 CPUs
 * don't save the ss and esp registers if the CPU is already in kernel mode
 * when it traps.  So &regs happens to be esp.  Valid only for kernel-mode
 * pt_regs.
 */
static inline unsigned long stack_pointer(struct pt_regs *regs)
{
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_32
	return (unsigned long)regs;
#else
	return regs->sp;
#endif
}
