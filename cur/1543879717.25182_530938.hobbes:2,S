Not sure if we _can_ do freeze_processes_nofail(). If something is
wrong (process in D state forever because of driver bug?), it looks
better to return error to userspace than looping forever.
You may want to pass higher timeout than 20sec. But if you can't
freeze everything in 1hour, it is unlikely to ever succeed.
