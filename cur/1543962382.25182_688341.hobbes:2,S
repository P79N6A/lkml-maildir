OK, the xfrm_output_resume trail revealed nothing.  Combined
with this crash however, it would appear that you've got a problem
with live skbs being freed.  Unfortunately such problems are
difficult to track down.
Perhaps you could enable SLAB debugging to see if we can get
closer to the culprit? Alternatively you could try a git bisection.
Unless we have a way of reproducing this there isn't a lot more
that we can do I'm afraid.
Cheers,
