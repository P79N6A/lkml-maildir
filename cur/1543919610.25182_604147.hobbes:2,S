Found it, but no more clues. Presumably it's some horrible
google workload... they're pretty happy to carry these kinds
of patches internally, right? ;)

Yeah, I really would rather not do this. If we actually go
through the whole fault path in mlock, then it doesn't
really matter what future baggage we attach to fault handlers...
(OK, we still technically have some problems with invalidations,
but mostly they're avoidable unless doing something silly).
How about just doing another PROT_READ mmap, and mlocking that?
(I was going to suggest another syscall, but that's probably
overkill).
