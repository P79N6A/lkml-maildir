I realise I did something stupid, but it took a while to figure it out, and 
I'm not going to be the only person to do this.
My laptop has built-in wireless (orinoco_cs), but I used a USB ethernet 
adapter to plug in to the wall for a bit (ohci-hcd and pegasus).
Then I the suspended the thing, unplugged the USB adapter, and packed the 
laptop up.  About twelve hours later, I fire the thing up, run "dhclient" to 
get a wireless connection, but the first thing it tried to touch was the USB 
connection that isn't there anymore.  So it hung, ctrl-c wouldn't kill it, 
and the process is stuck in D state.
Trying to figure out what was going on, I ran dhclient twice more and got two 
more processes stuck in D state.  It took a while to remember that yesterday 
I was using the USB adapter, but today I'm not.
Ordinarily, I don't think the ohci-hcd module is even loaded.  The kernel 
currently thinks it is, but modprobe -r ohci-hcd resulted in yet another 
process in D state...
As I said, I realise that unplugging even a USB adapter with the machine is 
suspended is Not A Good Thing.  But it's likely to be a common thing among 
people who can't figure out after the fact "oh yeah, that's what's going 
wrong"...
