Yes, you are correct.  class_interfaces are a pain :)

I think we already have enough paramaters in that function call...

I'm working toward getting rid of class_devices entirely.  What you can
do is use a struct device heirachy, right?  If so, take a look at this
patch:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/patches/device-class.patch
which implements the start of this changeover.  So, if you were to do
this, you can just create a separate "bus" and drivers for these
different devices, and everything should bind just fine.
Yeah, it is hard to create a bus today, but I'm also working on making
that easier too.  You can always just use the platform device interface
now to mock something up to see how well it works out.
thanks,
