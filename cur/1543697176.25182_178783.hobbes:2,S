In a way getting it to run under linux (in an pseudo-ndis-emu box) is part
of getting it reverse engineered - then we set up io-trace and presto we
know precisely what is going on ;)
Speaking of io-trace has anyone actually done this?  I'm working on a 
strace patch for io-trace'ing of user processes and have come to the 
conclusion that this should be at least partially done in kernel-space 
(you can't attach/detach to a pid without kernel support, you can io-trace 
a program from start to finish in pure userspace, but as soon as you want 
to attach to a running Xserver you are basically screwed (although that 
can be circumvened), however if you want to detach then you are screwed 
totally (unless you like live auto-patching of the traced program)...
I'm thinking of rewriteing the patch into the kernel ptrace mechanism 
(i.e. PTRACE_IO_SYSCALL - stop on IO operations or syscalls)
Cheers,
MaZe.
