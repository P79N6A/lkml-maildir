Hi Paul,
I had a similar problem yesterday and was pointed at
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelGitGuide?highlight=
%28CategoryKernel%29
as a starting point.
I was thinking it would be really nice if someone fancied writing a
git guide for dummies (like me) who only use git on and off. Something
that could be put either on git.kernel.org or a similar place.
Things like how to do basic checkouts, how to revert back to a certain
snapshot or a certain commit id, how to use git-bisect to track
breakage and other basic stuff.
Anyone looking for a pet project who fancies writing up something like
this? I can say for sure that it will be appreciated.
Cheers,
Jes
