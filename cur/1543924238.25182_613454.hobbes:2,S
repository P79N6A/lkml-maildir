One more question,
I currently prefix the names with "bdi-", is that needed?
That is, if I give the bdi object a parent, how will it look?
Would a bdi device with name "sda" with a block device called "sda" as
parent look like: /sys/block/sda/sda? Or would if be
called /sys/block/sda/bdi:sda or just /sys/block/sda/bdi?
