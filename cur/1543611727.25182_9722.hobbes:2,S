I'm currently using the Tyan Tiger mobo with the AMD Viper chipset. On past
kernels 2.4.14 and before definatly, hdparm -t gave me 3.8MB/s on my ATA100
drive. Using some IDE patch taht I'd found on the web, I was able to get to
28MB/s and 38MB/s with some tweaking. Now with the 2.4.16 kernel, I get
28MB/s which is a good improvement, but my drive is only being detected as
UDMA33, I have not tried forcing it to UDMA66 or UDMA100 like I had with the
IDE patch I found which had the same detecting problem. It seems that the
mode detection is broken, but the actual interface code is functioning.
Anyone else having similar problems? I'm using the IBM 60GB 75GXP drive.
