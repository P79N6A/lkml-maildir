This is confusing. Why the return code of the previous syslet atom?
Wouldn't it be more clear if the flag was for the current tasklet?
Worse, what is the previous atom? Imagine some case with a loop:
  A
  |
  B<--.
  |   |
  C---'
What will be the previous atom of B here? It can be either A or C,
but their return values can be different and incompatible, so what
flag should B set?

Might rename this to SYSLET_SKIP_NEXT_ON_STOP too then.
