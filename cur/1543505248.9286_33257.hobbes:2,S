Hi all.
I'm having weird problems with quota and kernel 2.0.37.  I am unable to
setup quotas for the /tmp filesystem.  The partition is mounted with
usrquota and grpquota enabled, if I run repquota -a after setting up the
quotas, it hangs after showing root filesystem quotas.  ps shows repquota
in the D state, and update is also in D state.  After reboot, the system
hangs while unmounting filesystems.  
I've experienced similar problems with 2.0.26 as well.
Is this a known problem?  I haven't been able to find anything in the
archives.  I'll be happy to provide as much detail as I can.
