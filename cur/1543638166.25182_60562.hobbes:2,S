Problem partially identified.
With CONFIG_PCI=n, include/asm-i386/ide.h:ide_init_default_hwifs()
is defined to ide_register_hw() the PC's standard IDE ports, but
with CONFIG_PCI=y, it's empty.
When drivers/ide/main.c:ide_setup() is called for some "ide..."
kernel option, it starts by calling init_global_data(), which
in turn calls ide_init_default_hwifs(). When CONFIG_PCI=n so
ide_init_default_hwifs() isn't empty, the kernel either hangs
or reboots at that point.
init_global_data() and ide_init_default_hwifs() can also be called
much later from 'module_init(init_ata)'. In that case there is no
hang or reboot -- so my guess is that the initialisation does something
which normally works but is illegal and causes a fault when done
at __setup()-time.
I tested every kernel from 2.5.29 and back, and the problem started
with 2.5.5.
As a workaround I applied the patch below to unconditionally
make ide_init_default_hwifs() do nothing. This solved my problem
and doesn't seem to have had any bad side-effects: the kernel still
finds all standard IDE ports on my 486.
