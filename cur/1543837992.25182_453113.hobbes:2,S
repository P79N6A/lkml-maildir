One other thing, putting a watchdog card in the box to automatically
reboot it if the machine hangs would also be a good thing. If you
don't have (or don't want to buy) such a card, then building the
kernel with the software watchdog is better than nothing - there are
situations where it'll fail to reboot the machine that a real watchdog
card would be able to handle, but it's a lot better than nothing.
