In principle that would be nice, but...  Take a look at those macros.
We can do that, but it would mean #define readb __readb, etc.  Since
really nasty clashes are in mem_inb() et.al. (let's face it, coming up
with one of those is far more likely than using ioswabb() for driver-internal
purposes) I've stopped at that.  Can do a followup switching to __ioswab...
and adding defines compensating for changes in visible symbols, but IMO
that's a separate patch...
