what causes that 'cause I've been battling with that for a  while
on 2.4.19-pre3 and 2.4.19-pre3-aa1. I put a couple of printk's to see
where the problem was (arch/i386/bluesmoke.c), but after rebooting it
did not show up. I just vompiled 2.4.19-pre3-aa and 2.4.19-pre3 +
preempt, I would like o have it solved before I reboot though
thanx
