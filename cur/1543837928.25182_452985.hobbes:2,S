It's really not that hard to get the limit:
        limit_in_bytes = new_esp | (THREAD_SIZE - 1)
        limit_in_pages = limit_in_bytes >> 12
And this will catch any bad accesses that assume zero-based pointers:
        kernel stack is at f7000000
        user stack is at   b7000000
        SS base =  40000000
        SS limit = b7001fff
All kernel pointers will be >c0000000 and will trap on access if they
try to use SS.  And it will work with any user/kernel split.
