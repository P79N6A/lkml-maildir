My boss wants to know if linux can handle a 2Terabyte raid
partition. While I've seen various discussions that indicate that
linux *should* be able to handle an ext2 file system that big, has
anyone actually produced one on an i386 arch? I admit that 32 73 gig
disks are a *lot* of blocks to worry about.
