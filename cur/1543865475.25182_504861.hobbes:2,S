The same reason we do any other checks. Why don't we let a normal use list
the contents of any directory they want to? Because we believe that allowing
people to do that, in the default shipping configuration, has disadvantages
that outweight the benefits. If someone disagrees, they are free to remove
the check or bypass it or whatever, by then they take those risks.

Exactly. It conveys the opinion of whoever set the tag that they believe it
is difficult to impossible to use that symbol in anything other than a
derived work. It is, to some extent, misnamed because the GPL does not
require all derived work to be placed under the GPL. (For example, a derived
work that is never distributed need not be placed under the GPL.)

No, you're dead on.
Why don't we allow a normal user to unlink any file? Because the person who
put in the check to prevent that believes that that's not something you
should be doing. If you *want* to do it, it's your right. But it is also
their right to put in the code that stops you, so that you have to *want* to
do it in order to do it.
The GPL allows me to add code and distribute and it allows you to remove
that same code if you want. If you disagree with my judgment, you may bypass
it at your own risk.
