Someone gave me a really awesome idea about possibly using a palm pilot
to capture the oops. Anyone know if it will be a problem using
/dev/ttyUSB0 as the serial port?
Baiscally if I want to duplicate the environment in which I'm getting
the oops, I need to be dialed out. That takes out COM1. I never gt my
COM2 to work (can't figure out what's wrong. doesn't work under windows
either). So that's out. I have a Keyspan USB PDA adapter that I use for
my Palm Vx which shows up as /dev/ttyUSB0.
I guess if usb serial can't be used I'll try duplicating the oops w/o
being dialed out.
