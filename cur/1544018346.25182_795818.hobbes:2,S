OK, replacing a lock_kernel() with a spin_lock(&global_lock) is pretty
straightforwad.  But it's really really sad.  It basically leaves a great
big FIXME in there.  It'd be better to fix it.
We don't have a handy lock in struct file which could be borrowed.
- We could add one
- We could borrow file->f_path.dentry->d_inode->i_lock
- We could convert that field to long and use bitops (sounds nice?)

It isn't completely obvious what fasync_mutex is protecting, why it exists.
A comment which explains this would be appropriate?
