Yes.  It killed my UP PII system hard last night (instant reboot, no messages). 
Mostly RH5.1 based.
This is definitely a very real problem.  The hit and miss nature of reproducing
the problem is due to libc/tool differences, but they're not the problem.  The
problem is that some processes with oddly constructed address spaces will bring
down the system violently.
Anyone run crashme on a recent kernel?
