Hello Dear,
I am Mr Desmond Wilfred, a merchant in Dubai, Arab
Emirate. I have been diagnosed with Cancer which was
discovered very 
late, due to my laxity in careing for
my health. It has defiled all 
forms of medicine, Right
now I have only about a few months to live, 
according
to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly lived my
life 
so well, as I never really cared for myself but
the oil business. 
Though I am very rich, I was never
generous, I only focused on my 
business as that was
the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all 
this
as I now know that there is more to life than just
wanting to have 
or make all the money in the world.
I believe when God gives me a 
second chance and heal
me I would live my life a different way from how 
I
have lived it. I have sowed a seed for my healing I
have willed and 
given most of my properties and assets
to my immediate and extended 
family members and as
well as a few close friends. 
I want God to be 
merciful to me and accept my soul and
so, I have decided to give arms 
to charity
organizations and give succour and comfort to the less
priviledged of the Tsunami Victims, as I want this to
be one of the 
last good deeds I do on earth.
So far, I have distributed money to 
some charity
organizations in India and Malaysia. Now that my
health 
has deteriorated so badly,I cannot do this my
self anymore. I once 
asked members of my family to
close one of my accounts in Saudi Bank 
and distribute
the money which I have there to charity organization
and 
to the less priviledged in Bulgaria and Sudan
Africa They cashed the 
money but kept it only to
themselves. Hence, I do not trust them 
anymore, as
they seem not to be contended with what I have left
for 
them already. 
The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge
cash deposit of twenty two million dollars that I have in the Vault of 
a  Financial
company in europe for safe keeping. 
I want you to collect 
this deposit on my behalf and
disburse it to the Tsunami EarthQuake 
victims in Asia
for the less priviledged. 
I will set aside 20% for 
you for your time and
efforts.
I need your urgent reply so that I will 
not have to go
on sarching for a incredible person to handle this
project. 
If you are okey with the condition, do not hesitate to
send 
me mail to (desmonddwiillfred@yahoo.co.uk} so that i can
furnish you up 
with all the informations needed.
I wish to hear from you soon.
God 
bless you. 
Mr Desmond.
