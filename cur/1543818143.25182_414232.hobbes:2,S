Looks like it could be the idle loop that is broken... some quick tests
here seem to show that we die on the first msleep, wherever it comes
from (the above messages are not totally relevant because time_init just
happens to be just before console_init which kills the early boot
console, and the crash happens before radeonfb kicks in, which happens
much later).
I'm travelling so I really didn't have a chance to debug this yet
properly, it could be related to Paul's idle loop changes, or not ...
will get back to this next week. It seems like all powermac (or almost)
are broken at the moment.
Ben.
