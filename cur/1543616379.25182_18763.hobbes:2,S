Ingo, there's something wrong there.
Not a way in hell should "nice 19" cause the throughput to improve like
that. It looks like this is a result of "nice 19" simply doing _different_
scheduling, possibly more batch-like, and as such those numbers cannot
sanely be compared to anything else.
(And if they _are_ comparable, then you should be able to get the good
numbers even without "nice 19". Quite frankly it sounds to me like the
whole chat benchmark is another "dbench", ie doing unbalanced scheduling
_helps_ it performance-wise, which implies that it's probably a bad
benchmark to look at numbers for).
