Not for statfs(), shm_open(), and sem_open().
Possibly for fstatfs(): fstatfs() has no way of looking up mount points per 
path name in /proc/mounts, and so it resorts to mapping from the numeric 
statfs->f_type to the filesystem name (e.g., "ext3"), looks up the first 
mount point with that name, and sets the statfs->f_flag flags based on that 
entry. This field may change from one arbitrary value to another.
