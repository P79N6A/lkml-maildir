Not necessarily a solution but have you thought of putting chvt in the
suspend/resume sequence? chvt to a terminal before suspending and chvt
to X after resume.
This was one of the things I used to do when I had BIOS suspend to disk
working (it was nice but then gateway *spit* decided to remove it in a
bios upgrade).
Still, the above might help you until you find someone to throw money
at. ;)
