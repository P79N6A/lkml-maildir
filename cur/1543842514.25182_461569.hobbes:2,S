Hey, what do you know? Good call. I can actually just "S"ave the message 
to a file, and it is a perfectly fine patch. But when I view it in my mail 
reader, your "format=flowed" means that it _shows_ it as being corrupted 
(ie word wrapping and missing spaces at the beginning of lines).
Will apply, thanks. It would be better if your mailer didn't lie about the 
format though (treating the text as "flowed" definitely isn't right, and 
some mail gateways might actually find it meaningful, for all I know).
