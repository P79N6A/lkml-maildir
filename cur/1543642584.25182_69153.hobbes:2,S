    Hi Thomas :))
    AFAIK, 'sleep()' is a libc function, and if you use GNU libc, it
doesn't make use of SIGALRM, so it is safe to use 'setitimer()' and
'sleep()' at the same time on a program.
    Moreover, 'setitimer()' is too a libc function to my knowledge (I
may be wrong here, so please don't hit me XDD).
