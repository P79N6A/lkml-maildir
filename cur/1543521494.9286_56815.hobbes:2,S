Subject: [patch] - i386:show_registers incorrect esp

Hi Linus,
show_registers in i386 arch shows incorrect esp. Current code takes (regs+1) as
esp. It should be (&regs->esp). i386 does not push esp and ss on stack when a
fault occurs at level 0. Hence xss and esp from pt_regs are absent for faults
in the kernel.
Attached patch against 2.3.38 fixes this problem.
Can you please include it in next kernel?
Thanks.
