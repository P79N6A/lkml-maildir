Ok, I did some analysis and found that 'hdparm -t <device> '
generates reads which are of size 1M. This means 256 page requests are
generated by a single read.  
do_generic_mapping_read()  gets the request to read 256 pages. But with
the latest change, this function calls do_pagecahce_readahead() to keep 
256 pages ready in cache. And after having done that
do_generic_mapping_read() tries to access those 256 pages.
But by then some of the pages may have been replaced under low pagecache
conditions. Hence we end up spending extra time reading those pages
again into the page cache.
I think the same problem must exist while reading files too. Paulo
Ornati used cat command to read the file. cat just generates 1 page
request per read and hence the problem did not show up. The problem must
show up if 'dd if=big_file of=/dev/null bs=1M count=256' is used.
To conclude, I think the bug is with the changes to filemap.c 
If the changes are reverted the regression seen with blockdevices should
go away.
Well this is my theory, somebody should validate it,
