Nope.  The L2 lines are 32 or 64 bytes long, and the only unit we can
defrag in is pages which are 4k.  Since everything is aligned, a
cacheline cannot cross a page.

You're talking about page coloring now.  That a whole different debate. 
I think it's been discussed here before. :)  It's good.  It's bad.  It's
good.  It's bad.
