hmmm, you think so? I felt a bit embarrased after posting it because I
thought it was not such a good idea because one would have to reorganize
the way we pass parameters to do_poll() completely. Well, do_poll() only
walks through one element at a time so it can walk through the (say,
linked list?) of slab'd pollfd objects one at a time.

I know - we had lots of chats with Mark Hemment about this
stuff and I gradually moved from understanding 0.1% to about 78% of what
he is talking about :)
