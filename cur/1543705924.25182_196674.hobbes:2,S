Sigh...  we have
        switch (dev->mode) {
        case IMM_NIBBLE:
        case IMM_PS2:
                ports = 3;
                break;
        case IMM_EPP_8:
        case IMM_EPP_16:
        case IMM_EPP_32:
                ports = 8;
                break;
        default:        /* Never gets here */
                BUG();
        }
	...
	/* use the value of 'ports' */
IOW, gcc doesn't realize that we never return from BUG().  AFAICS, it
should.  Some changes of __volatile__ semantics?
