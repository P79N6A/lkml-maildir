Either that or you've compiled loopback devices directly in to the
kernel this time around, they were modules last time around, and you
have kept the same kernel name.  If you do this the make modules_install
blasts the module from the /lib/modules/2.4.xx and a subsequent mkinitrd
can't load the loopback module.  Check out dmesg to see if this is the
problem.
