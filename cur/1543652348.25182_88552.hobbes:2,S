something similar is needed in the scsi layer for other reasons too; I
can imagine something that behaves similar as the network layer's 
netif_stop_queue() and allows drivers to inform the upper layer to stop
trying to submit requests to the lower level driver. Fiber channel
drivers can do this for example on LIP down (and enable again on LIP
up). LIP is not the only reason this is useful; overall I estimate that
over half of the code in the (out of tree) qlogic 2x00 driver can be
removed if this functionality was available.
