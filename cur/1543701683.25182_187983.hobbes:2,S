That should work.  The chip used for the i8[67]5 boards used to behave
like this, but apparently to somebody else on the list it was because
it could not handle variable data lengths (could have the term wrong)
written to it, and was fixed driver side - this is not maybe an issue
for the sis based boards as well (using a realtek chip i think??) ?
Meaning its chip/driver side, not OSS-emu side?
