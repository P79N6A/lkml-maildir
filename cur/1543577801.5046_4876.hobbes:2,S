Well, I think yes. I'll do some testing on the 2.2 before I can tell
you for sure, but definitely the system is behaving badly where I
think it should not.

OK, I can buy that.

So far so good... A little bit weird but not alarming per se.

Yes, that's it. So it looks like all of my processes are on the
swap. That can't be good. I mean, even Solaris (known to eat swap
space like there's no tomorrow :)) would probably be more polite.

Yes, I would say really a lot more. Big diffeence.
Also, I don't see a diference between allocated and used swap space on
the Linux. Could you elaborate on that?

I'll get back to you later with more data. Time to boot 2.2. :)
