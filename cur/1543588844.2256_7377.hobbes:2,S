I'm dealing with a driver wich need the IP address for specifics using.
I've read in the linux device driver (o'reilly) that I can use the field
pa_addr in the struct device. but it doesn't exist on my computer.
so I don't understand why ? Is anybody could tell me where finding the
IP address in the kernel ?
thanks a lot.
nb : 	my kernel version is 2.2.14, as it is my first driver I am starting
	on the current kernel I've got but I'll also need informations
	for kernel 2.4.X
