Ah, if someone's looking at the 3c59x driver then please look into the
NWAY autonegotiation code - even maybe update it to use mii.c.
Currently 3c59x is rather buggy - it's a fairly simple bug.  Consider
this:
# mii-tool -v
eth0: negotiated 100baseTx-HD, link ok
  product info: TDK 78Q2120 rev 11
  basic mode:   autonegotiation enabled
  basic status: autonegotiation complete, link ok
  capabilities: 100baseTx-HD 10baseT-HD
  advertising:  100baseTx-HD 10baseT-HD
  link partner: 100baseTx-FD 100baseTx-HD 10baseT-FD 10baseT-HD flow-control
and then wonder why we end up like this:
eth0: Setting full-duplex based on MII #0 link partner capability of 45e1.
Obviously completely bogus.  Luckily, there isn't that much traffic
to this card _and_ it's connected to a switch so it doesn't interfere
much with other network traffic.  However, it is _dog_ slow when doing
large transfers to/from it.
FYI, it's:
04:00.0 Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation 3c575 [Megahertz] 10/100 LAN CardBus (rev 01)
aka 3CCFE575BT.  The BT version only has a HD-capable MII transceiver,
whereas the CT version has a FD-capable MII transceiver fitted.
