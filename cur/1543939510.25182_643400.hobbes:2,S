I tend to agree.  Either you need your fs frozen, or not, and if you do,
be prepared for the consequences.

What's the safety concern; that the admin will forget to unfreeze?

That's what I was thinking; can't the path to freeze_bdev just be
elevated out of dm-ioctl.c to fs/ioctl.c and exposed, such that any
filesystem which implements .write_super_lockfs can be frozen?  This is
essentially what the xfs_freeze userspace does via
xfs_ioctl/XFS_IOC_FREEZE - which, AFAIK, isn't used much now that the
lvm hooks are in place.
I'm also not sure I see the point of the timeout in the original patch;
either you are done snapshotting and ready to unfreeze, or you're not;
1, or 2, or 3 seconds doesn't really matter.  When you're done, you're
done, and you can only unfreeze then.  Shouldn't this be done
programmatically, and not with some pre-determined timeout?
