Subject: [patch] resend - spurious ENOTCONN in shutdown()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch seems to have vanished, so I'm resending it.
If you close down the write end of a TCP socket with shutdown(sock, SHUT_WR)
and then come back later and try to close its read side, shutdown will
return -ENOTCONN.  This breaks some user applications that expect to
be able to shutdown read and write separately and in any order.  For
example, openssh 1.2.2 wants to do this.
This patch causes inet_shutdown() to check tcp_connected() only if
shutting down write, which does more or less the Right Thing.
