after upgrading from 2.6.15 to 2.6.20.1 i got problem with my usb modem (terayon).
kern.log it said:
usb 3-1: new full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 2
usb 3-1: no configuration chosen from 1 choice
my solution was to 
replace
#ifndef CONFIG_USB_NET_RNDIS_HOST
with 
#ifndef CONFIG_USB_NET_RNDIS_HOST_MODULE
in drivers/usb/core/generic.c
