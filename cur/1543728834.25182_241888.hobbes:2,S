I used O7.
I have tested this for a day now, and I have noticed problems:
1)
kernel syslog gets a record like this:
 >  (default.hotplug/1470): 121 us critical section violates 100 us 
threshold.

and the /proc/latency_trace gets:

Could the patch be adjusted to make the syslog and the 
/proc/latency_trace produce the same output?
2)
I suspect that there is a problem with reiserfs, but when I detect a 
momentary hang in the system(mouse stops moving), no latency_trace appears.
