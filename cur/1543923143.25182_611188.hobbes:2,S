Hmm...

-> Adds suspend support, but fails to remove the !PM (5.12.2005)
So it looks like that !PM is false.
I have the following device:
Bus 001 Device 005: ID 1058:0400 Western Digital Technologies, Inc.
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 1058:0600 Western Digital Technologies, Inc.
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 1058:0500 Western Digital Technologies, Inc.
aka Western Digital Media Center
This firewire+usb hdd enclosure also has three buttons.
But it looks like that uses another driver:
hiddev0hidraw1: USB HID v1.10 Device [Western Digital External HDD] on
usb-0000:00:02.1-5.2
Otherwise I would be willing to try to test this, if someone would
tell me how to check that the second commit did fix the suspend
problem.
