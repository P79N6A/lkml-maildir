I am having the same problems on my Alpha systems.  After 2 days of uptime
all the swap space is eaten up and the system has an OOM condition.  The
machines are under heavy network usage.  I have been testing the tcp patch
on another AlphaLinux box and I am not sure it has helped yet or not.
The only driver that I use that Mr. Arvin was using is the SYM8xxx driver
and the usual networking code, but I have seen this leak since 2.2.10 and
it really causes a lot of problems.
