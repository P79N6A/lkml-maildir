Subject: [BK PATCH] Driver Core update for 2.6.1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Here are a few kobject and driver core changes for 2.6.1.  The majority
of these are the "class_simple" patches that have been in the -mm tree
for quite a while now.  They add sysfs class support for a wide range of
different class devices, which is required for tools like udev to be
able to do device naming in userspace.  Andrew suggested that I send
them to you now.  All of the different driver subsystem maintainers
(when there is one) have ACKed these changes.
Please pull from:

thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
