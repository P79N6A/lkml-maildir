Hi!
* acpi problems are gone, good -- it now boots with acpi=off and boots
with enabled pci hotplugging.
	(that uncovered other problem where machine dies if I try to
	undock it... This has worked before. I'll report it properly.)
* pcmcia ide now works, good.
* swsusp still works, thanks for speedup!
								Pavel
