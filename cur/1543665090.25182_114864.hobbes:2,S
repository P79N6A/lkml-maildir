As far as I understand this isn't error path. 
	lock_kernel();
	sb = inode->i_sb;
	if (is_dx(inode)) {
		err = ext3_dx_readdir(filp, dirent, filldir);
		if (err != ERR_BAD_DX_DIR)
			return err;
		/*
		 * We don't set the inode dirty flag since it's not
		 * critical that it get flushed back to the disk.
		 */
		EXT3_I(filp->f_dentry->d_inode)->i_flags &= ~EXT3_INDEX_FL;
	}
So, if ext3_dx_readdir() returns 0 (OK path), then ext3_readdir() finish
w/o unlock_kernel(). The remain part of ext3_readdir() gets used if
ext3_dx_readdir() can't use HTree and returns ERR_BAD_DX_DIR.
Am I miss something?
