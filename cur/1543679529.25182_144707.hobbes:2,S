hi,
i don't know if it is a kernel issue at all, it could be a hardware 
issue too, but i can't tell so please have a look.
i am using linux 2.4.20 on a PowerPC (PReP) with a "LSI Logic / Symbios 
Logic (formerly NCR) 53c825 (rev 13)" scsi controller (onboard). i am 
using the symbios driver (CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX) because the other 
alternatives (NCR53C8XX, timeouts during boot, booting stops. 
SYM53C8XX_2, timeouts during use, unuseable) are not working.
i have these timouts when there is heavy traffic on the controller, it's 
reproduceable, it happens only *sometimes* during "normal" use. when 
these timeouts occur, load goes up to 10-16, the system is unuseable, 
then, after a few seconds, the system status seems to be ok again, load 
is going down to normal.
i know, the controller and the machine is a bit old, but it serves my 
needs. on the controller there are 3 scsi disks (2x18 GB IBM xServer, 
1x36GB eServer -- yes High-End scsi disks on a low-end controller, but 
the disks were cheap, somehow.)
here are the timeouts:
scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 3463623, scsi0, channel 0,\ 
id 1, lun 0 Read (10) 00 01 d0 1e 9a 00 01 00 00
sym53c8xx_abort: pid=3463623 serial_number=3463623 
serial_number_at_timeout=3463623
SCSI host 0 abort (pid 3463623) timed out - resetting
SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
sym53c8xx_reset: pid=3463623 reset_flags=2 serial_number=3463623\ 
serial_number_at_timeout=3463623
sym53c825a-0-<0,*>: FAST-10 WIDE SCSI 20.0 MB/s (100.0 ns, offset 8)
sym53c825a-0-<1,*>: FAST-10 WIDE SCSI 20.0 MB/s (100.0 ns, offset 8)
sym53c825a-0-<2,*>: FAST-10 WIDE SCSI 20.0 MB/s (100.0 ns, offset 8)
the first line ("scsi: abort...") is sometimes repeated, 2 or up to 7 
times. the last 3 lines are always repeated 3 times, as you can see 
above. and the "id" is not always "1" but all three id's are affected.
while i don't believe that the disks are bad, i suspect the scsi 
controller perhaps, or is it a driver issue and can i tune something?
the driver is statically compiled into the kernel with default settings.
(DEFAULT_TAGS=8, MAX_TAGS=32, SYNC=20).
what is your opinion on that? the controller, the disks (perhaps too new 
for the controller?) or the driver?
Thank you for your time,
Christian.
