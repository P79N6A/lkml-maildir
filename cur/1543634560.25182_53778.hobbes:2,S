When booting 2.5.23/.24, my test boxes generate the following:
(an ASUS P4T-E which has SBF)
__iounmap: bad address d0802100
SBF: Simple Boot Flag extension found and enabled.
__iounmap: bad address d0805040
__iounmap: bad address d0808080
SBF: Setting boot flags 0x1
(an old Intel AL440LX which doesn't have SBF)
__iounmap: bad address c4800009
__iounmap: bad address c4804b8c
__iounmap: bad address c4802009
These warnings/errors are new since 2.5.23, which makes me
suspect something's wrong in the 2.5.23 iounmap changes.
