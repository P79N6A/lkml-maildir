the contradiction to this is that the flashdisk can be used
in a "partition-less" state where it is possible to use the
whole device at one: "mke2fs /dev/sdb". you have to use the
vendor formating-tool to make the flashdisk look like an USB_FDD
device. but even in USB_HDD mode with partitions, the partitions
still look strange, not ending on cylinder boundaries and so on.
oh my. I guess I gonna contact Panram then and of course,
thanks for the URL to the USB-snoop utility.
thx
