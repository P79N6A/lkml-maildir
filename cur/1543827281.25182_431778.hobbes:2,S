WTF?  In none of my examples did block size ever change.  In none of my 
examples was block size ever mentioned as a factor.
Inode density was demonstrably different in the resize vs. mkfs cases.
And online resize -obviously- imposes a limit on inode density, by 
locking inodes-per-group at fs creation time.  Dynamic allocation of 
inode tables would permit dynamic sizing of inode tables based on 
current needs, rather than needs determined at fs creation time.
