No I don't really want to bother the real developers because they are doing real
work. What I'm doing could almost be called butchering, but it definitely gave
me a performance advantage and seemed a shame to not share the work given the
effort I put in.

I don't really have the time to benchmark these things any more than "it feels
faster". Really I'm spending way too much time on this as it is and I'm not
remotely any authority on what benchmarks to use.

Ok thanks for the info. I believe the newer cc patch (not in my 2.4.18-ck4) is
better anyway. I'm afraid the cc will be later in the piece assuming I can kill
off the other bug I've created in the merge. I'd prefer to see a cc patch
specifically for 2.4.19 as forward porting it to .19 and then to O(1) (and so
on) are just too many steps. 
Cheers,
