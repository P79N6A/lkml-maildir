Yes it's one request for a non-contig range, or a number of contig ones.
It isn't quite clear that this is always a good thing. Since we are
moving request from the sorted list, there's a chance that even though
serving X and then X+1 will incur a seek, it will be a small one. But
for now, yes, a seek is a seek and 16 is equal to seek_cost and
therefore it will be just the one.

Yes of course, that has been the plan all along. I'm in fact doing that
right now.

Noone ever questioned the fact that these tunables should in fact be
tunable.
