the driver is improving for sure.
What seems to work well is when we make a work-to-do list, the vendor
then goes about and fixes most of that quite quickly. I think I'm
approaching the end of useful review input I can give (they fixed most
if not all the stuff I flagged before), it would be really nice if
Christoph or some other scsi person would do a review again and make a
list of "these should be fixed and then we can merge" (and a list of
"these can be fixed post merge" as well)
