i agree that this could be connected with dma transfers ... maybe the
disconnect procedure disturbs dma transfers on slower cpus, where the
disconnect/reconnect procedure takes to long ?
maybe it is realy a metter of the motherboard ? who realy knows ? maybe a
amd/via guru could answer this question ... at the moment i can't answer
it ... and my system isn't affected by this sound skips ... so i even
can'T make testes on it ...
maybe someon with this skips could make some tests ?
disabling/enabling dma , change some timings for pci bus in bios or such
things ?
