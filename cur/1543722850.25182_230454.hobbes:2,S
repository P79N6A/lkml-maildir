I tried this on PA.  Our gcc definitely generates the correct code, even
without the volatile...
By the way, I had to try with a genuine volatile since
tasklet_struct.state isn't actually volatile in linux/interrupt.h

But in the current kernel, there are no bitops on volatile data in the
parisc tree.  This cpumask is the first such one that we've come
across...

But that's my point.  Currently there is no volatile pointer bitops (and
I have bitten the heads off a few people who tried to introduce some),
so there's no existing case to justify being backward compatible with.

test_bit's a special case.  The lock is to prevent data corruption, not
racing between test_bit and set_bit.

That's not what our gcc seems to do (both 3.0.4 and 3.3.4)
