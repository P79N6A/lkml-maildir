	The format could be(*) the same, but a few issues in the
	e.g. page cache, and API/ABI prevent current 32-bit
	linux systems to exceed 2GB file size.
	For further reading, see my patches for this at:

/Matti Aarnio <matti.aarnio@sonera.fi>
(*) The format is basically the same, however EXT2 code isn't currently
    quite clean to handle large file sizes at 32-bit machines.
    In theory it is just a matter of using 'long long' variables,
    but it isn't quite that simple...
