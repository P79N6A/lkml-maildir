The question is, what _should_ happen when yu attach to a stopped
process?  If the tracer receives the same one SIGSTOP that it normally
would, then it will just resume the program as if it weren't stopped. 
Does that make sense or not?
As for Vic's patch, the SIGSTOP leaving processes stopped bit is
already fixed in 2.5, I believe.  We need to decide what should happen
when attaching to a stopped process before that half can be considered.
(And the patch itself is wrong; send_sig is too broad a hammer for
this, it should probably be something more like force_sig_specific; but
I'm not sure that's the right approach.  I'll think about it.)
