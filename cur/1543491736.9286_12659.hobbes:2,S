Hi !
Nowdays I must move,delete,add etc some of my partitions.
Using fdisk with Linux gives for 'w' command :
Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered!
Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
Syncing disks.
Re-read table failed with error 16: Device or resource busy.
Reboot your system to ensure the partition table is updated.
ANd because of the 'device or resource busy' Linux don't see any of
my new and modified partitions because it could not reread the partition
table. (I can mount my partition which was deleted with fdisk etc)
This is ugly because I must reboot my Linux server four times to
do my job ;-( Why can't Linux reread partition table if modified partitions
was not mounted ?
As far as I remember I hadn't problem with older 2.2.x kernels, but
with 2.2.5 I must reboot every time :(
Thanks : Gabor,
