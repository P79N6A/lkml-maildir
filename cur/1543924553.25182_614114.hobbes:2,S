For the record, I think you are both right. I took a stab at it back
when Casey and I first met:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs/old/kernel-2.4-fcap/README
all that stuff worked fine it was just a bit ahead of its time...
- From memory, at that point in time "extended attributes" were an
external patch, and having some trouble getting merged. My sense was
that EA was a pre-requisite and I was happy to wait for that support to
become integrated before pushing my file capability support.
In the midst of all this LSM emerged as a reaction to Linus' clear
unhappiness about all extensions security. I didn't have the time to
participate in the LSM, and my work sat in the form of these patches.
SELinux at that time existed as a separate infrastructure, and evidently
did have the time to embrace LSM.

So, yes, IBM (Serge) deserve full credit for starting over, and getting
it merged...
Cheers
