Good point.  It is the first step towards BKL less native ioctls. So it's 
certainly a good idea even for the non compat case.

Patch looks good to me, except for some messed up white space
that is probably easily fixed.

I doubt any of the compat wrappers need BKL, they never touch
any global state and then just call sys_ioctl which takes the BKL
only when needed.
Ok there is a slight possibility that out of tree code wrote
compat wrappers that need BKL, but in that case they will just
have to deal with the bugs. Removing register_ioctl32_conversion
and some comments would take care of them anyways.
