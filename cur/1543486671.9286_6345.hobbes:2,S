	Add to your collection the following example: guy installed RH on
/dev/hda and got the type of /dev/hdb1 changed from 0xa5 to 0xb5. /dev/hdb
had only one partition, full-size (and used for FreeBSD). Both Linux and
FreeBSD loader were not happy about it - the former simply didn't see the
disklabel, the latter refused to boot. After changing the type back to
0xa5 everything worked fine.
