Drivers are using schedule_work() to create process contexts where
they can sleep, potentially for many seconds.  On a single cpu
system, or a loaded SMP system, schedule_work() from one of the
drivers you converted could easily be delayed for 30 seconds or more.
schedule_work() is not a fast path.
If work needs to happen ASAP, then you really want to replace those
schedule_work() calls with schedule_tasklet() calls that do the
"must be done asap" work, and then schedule_work() the stuff that
requires process context...  So, too, I would have thought that
bottom-half completion routines mapped more directly to
schedule_tasklet() anyway.
