I think you answered your own question.
Did I miss some things in the fixup patch?  Yes; unfortunately,
I'm not as consistent as the machine.
I started another fixup patch with the things you mentioned.
Let me know if you find others, and I'll fix them, too.  I'll
probably wait for the next cycle to do more fixups.
