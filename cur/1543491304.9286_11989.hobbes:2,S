  4) mix!
A little toy I wrote when I was doing a gcc port many moons ago. It
still seems to work.
You compile something with 'gcc -S -g foo.c' then run 'mix foo.s' and it
spits out a nice mixture of the C and assembly.
main()
{
	p1();
	p2(2);
	p3("s");
}
gives
;0002 foo.c
;0002 {
     .LM1:
             pushl %ebp
             movl %esp,%ebp
;0003         p1();
     .LM2:
     .LBB2:
             call p1
;0004         p2(2);
     .LM3:
             pushl $2
             call p2
             addl $4,%esp
;0005         p3("s");
     .LM4:
             pushl $.LC0
             call p3
             addl $4,%esp
;0006 }
