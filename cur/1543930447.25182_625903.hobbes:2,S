yes, i understand the initial announcement (and the Kconfig entry still 
says the same), but that is not matched up by the reality i see in the 
actual code - SLUB clearly uses a queue/list of objects (as cited in my 
previous mail), for obvious performance reasons.
unless i'm missing something obvious (and i easily might), i see SLUB as 
SLAB reimplemented with a different queueing model. Not "without 
queueing".

i'm curious about the real facts behind this "alien cache problem". I 
heard about it and asked around and was told that there's some sort of 
bad quadratic behavior of memory consumption on NUMA - but i cannot 
actually see that in the code.
The alien caches feature of SLAB i see as a spread out clustered 
index/cache of objects on other nodes. It's not increasing the average 
per object memory consumption per se! The number of alien caches 
increases with increasing number of nodes, but _of course_, as memory 
size increases too so there's more stuff and a larger expected spreadout 
of memory to keep track of. ("Fixing" that would be like reintroducing a 
single runqueue for the scheduler, based on the argument that it's an 
O(1) number of runqueues against O(N) number of runqueues - which would 
be complete nonsense.)
so i see SLAB alien caches as an automatic self-partitioning mechanism 
... which has complexities but which also has _obvious_ performance 
benefits. Yes, it has some disadvantages like all caching schemes do - 
there's more cached memory tied up in the allocator at any given moment 
- but arguing against that would be like arguing against a 2MB L2 cache 
purely on the basis that a 1MB L2 cache is smaller and hence more 
space-efficient. Caches are there to cache stuff, and more caches ... 
use more memory. It's all a question of proportion and tuning, but the 
_design_ should be based on having as thorough caching as possible.
