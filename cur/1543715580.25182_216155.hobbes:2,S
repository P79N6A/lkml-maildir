Hello!
I keep on getting messages like this:
laura:/media/some_SMB_mounted_Directory # ls
ls: .: Too many open files in system
Haven't seen this before I upgraded to 2.4.25, and I do not have a public
server, lsof lists less than 3000 lines
The workarround is to press tab to make bash auto-complete, but I wonder
if there is a kernel-based configuration or some other info available?
Hope, somebody can help!
Greetings from germany, Jim
