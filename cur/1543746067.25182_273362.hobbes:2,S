ah, i think i understand: fluidsynth has roughly the same CPU overhead
when it is 'silent' (it's generating small static noise in that case),
compared to when it's playing a MIDI file - so i should be able to see
the xruns if i just run jackd and 8 fluidsynth instances, and then load
the box - correct?
