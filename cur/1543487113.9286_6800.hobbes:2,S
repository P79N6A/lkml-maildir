Ah well, just a bit of mess. In 2.0.36 the ioctl 0x060f means LP_STRICT
while in 2.2.2 means LP_TRUSTIRQ.
So yes you can just grab tunelp 
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/tunelp/
 and get
my first (and only) tunelp release. If you'll use the -T option you'll be
able to set/unset the STRICT flag in 2.0.36 I think.
Really I think we could drop the TRUSTIRQ thing from lp... It was a good
improvement here but the point right now is that if somebody really need
to boost it's better that he goes in sync with the latest parport code
that uses the FIFO of the port that does the compatibility mode handshake
in hardware... Killing the trustirq flag should be a one liner patch or a
little bit more, sure something of safe also for a stable kernel release.
