This is not possible with the current kernel API.  The best you can get
is file->network transfers using sendfile.  What you are looking for is
something similar to the splice() system call, or a zero-copy I/O path. 
Zero copy I/O is not possible without hardware support of some kind, as
even if we can pull VM games, we still need to checksum.

As soon as an ACK is sent or the system tries to delay an ACK and
piggyback it onto another.

Not from userspace.

Expect to see this sometime in the next month or two available as a
patch.
