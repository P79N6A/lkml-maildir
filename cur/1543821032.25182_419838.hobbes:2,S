Subject: [PATCH] buglet in radix_tree_tag_set
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The comment states: 'Setting a tag on a not-present item is a BUG.'
Hence if 'index' is larger than the maxindex; the item _cannot_
be presen; it should also be a BUG.
Also, this allows the following statement (assume a fresh tree):
  radix_tree_tag_set(root, 16, 1);
to fail silently, but when preceded by:
  radix_tree_insert(root, 32, item);
it would BUG, because the height has been extended by the insert.
In neither case was 16 present.
