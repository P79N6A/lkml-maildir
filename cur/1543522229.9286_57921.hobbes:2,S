Yes, this patch is motivated by a linux port of the Brown simulator.
While the sigcontext contains the information we need, we'd like to
share as much code with the Solaris version as possible. The patch is
also useful from the standpoint of de-facto standards compliance; many
programs expext si_addr and si_code to be correctly filled in for
SEGV's.
Below is the same patch, reworked for 2.3.39. Gurus-- is this or is
this not a welcome/useful patch? I realize that do_page_fault is a
sensitive place to be playing around, but the patch is not particularly
risky. Should I be making these patches against the 2.3.40 pre-patches?
I appreciate any feedback.
Thanks, Keith Adams
