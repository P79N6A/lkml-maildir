If you pass bad pointer to memcpy(), you don't expect any reasonable
return value, right?
So if you pass bad pointer to read(), why would you expect "number of
bytes read" return? Its true that kernel can't simply not return
anything, but giving SIGSEGV and returning -EFAULT seems pretty
reasonable to me. If they really want to, they might extract number of
bytes read from address SIGSEGV occured at [but that's dirty hack, and
people will hopefully realise that and not rely on it].
