I can understand your point about not jumping into something that will turn
out (possibly) to be a big flop and cause new confusion.  However, I'd like
to point out that any new idea will _never_ become adopted if everyone takes
the position of "I'm not going to do it until most everyone else does first".
If this is going to be the common usage, I believe we need to be the lead on
this and do it.  The question is, how can we determine if it will be common
_before_ anyone else takes the lead to make it be so.
