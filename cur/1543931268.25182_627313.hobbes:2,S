I'll just add one more bit of information which might effect the 
situation. The CPU I am using is an Elan SC520 microcontroller.
It seems that this CPU is able remap the General Purpose ports (IO 
ports) into the lower 1GB of memory space.
I will investigate.
If anyone knows anything about doing this, please speak up. This is a 
legacy CPU in our product range, and I don't have much experience with it.
