Eh? The whole of India is 5 1/2 ahead of GMT (India Standard Time - IST). The whole of
China is 8 hours ahead of GMT (China Standard Time - CST). I don't know where you saw
odd 1/4 hours. Maybe that's actually a Nepal oddity.
With an appreciation of time zones like that you should work for Microsoft. A good 20%
of the time zones in Windows are wrong, and inconsistent between versions.
