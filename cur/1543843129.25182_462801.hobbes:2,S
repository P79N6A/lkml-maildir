To add a small detail.  The reason it's printed that way is because 
libata (the new ATA driver) emulates SCSI device at the moment, so it 
has to fake SCSI vendor ID and model string, which BTW is shorter than 
ATA string and thus truncated in some cases.  The vendor ID "ATA" is 
defined in SAT (SCSI ATA translation) standard, IIRC.
For the time being, we'll have to live with boilerplate ATA vendor and 
truncated vendor ID.  There are plans to make libata independent from 
SCSI which should solve the problem but it will take quite some time.
