  Down such path lies madness :)   This list would have to be maintained for
  most every model, of every drive, for every manufacturer.  The list could
  conceivably change weekly, if not sooner.  This could change, of course, if
  the use of linux would become as ubiquitous as the dominant redmond produnt, 
  and the manufacturers would supply the "mini-port" driver bits, as it were.
  The theory is wonderful.  Until there is enough "clout" to change the 
  manufacturers participation, it is probably futile. :-/
