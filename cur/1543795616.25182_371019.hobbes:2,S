It might be worth trying the below.  Mainly for the debugging check.
From: Andrea Arcangeli <andrea@suse.de>
Greg Edwards found some deadlock in the icache shrinker.
I believe the major bug is that the VM is currently potentially setting nr
= LONG_MAX before shrinking the icache (and the icache shrinker never
returns -1, which means the api doesn't currently require shrinkers to
return -1 when they're finished).
The below is the most obviously safe way I could address this problem
(still untested).
This is not necessairly the way we want to fix it in mainline, but it at
least shows what I believe to be the major cuplrit in the code (i.e.  nr
growing insane ;).
