Correct.  It is not just the header file that is at issue, though; the
whole build procedure for the aic7xxx driver changed.

It would not be too hard to do what you suggest, but would make for
very long CPPFLAGS.  Which is inconvenient if you like to actually see
what's going on when you do a build.  I think more of the include
files at issue should probably be in the kernel include tree, and not
hidden in the driver tree.  That would make the issue moot.
What are the things you're planning that will cause trouble?  I would
also think it would be less of an issue with 2.5 if there is some hope
that in-kernel PCMCIA is going to be the standard.
