I'd prefer just documenting it and keeping it. I'd hate to have two fairly
different modes of behaviour. It's always been the suggested "twice the
amount of RAM", although there's historically been the "Linux doesn't
really need that much" that we just killed with 2.4.x.
If you have 512MB or RAM, you can probably afford another 40GB or so of
harddisk. They are disgustingly cheap these days.
