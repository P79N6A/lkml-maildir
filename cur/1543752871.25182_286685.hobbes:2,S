That arp is perfectly OK.
The routing table will cause the icmp echo packet to go from 10.216.0.xx 
to 10.0.24.xx via the 10.0.24.x network.
The icmp echo response will return via the 10.0.22.x network back to the 
10.216.0.xx network.
So the paths in each direction are different.
the "arp who-has 10.0.22.1 tell 10.0.24.xx", you can safely ignore the 
"10.0.24.xx" bit, as that will be ignored by the device responding to 
the ARP.
It is just highlighting the point that you have 2 paths to the same 
destination.
Cheers
