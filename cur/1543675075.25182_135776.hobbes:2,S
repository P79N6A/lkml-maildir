Subject: patch-2.4.21-rc4-ac1.bz2 on kernel.org is really patch-2.4.21-rc2-ac3?

After trying to apply a freshly downloaded "patch-2.4.21-rc4-ac1.bz2"
from kernel.org and getting 53 rejects, I took a look inside and:
--- linux.21rc2/arch/alpha/kernel/entry.S       2003-05-09
18:05:01.000000000 +0100
+++ linux.21rc2-ac3/arch/alpha/kernel/entry.S   2003-04-22
16:44:36.000000000 +0100
etc.
The .gz patch is the same.
