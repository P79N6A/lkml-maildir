On one or two it is.

What I'd guess is he has a board that keeps the counters in hardware - such
as the 3c59x/3c90x card. Those boards give you a counter overflow interrupt
at which point you have to poke about a little read the counts and kick
the card.
I imagine that isnt the most tested code path
