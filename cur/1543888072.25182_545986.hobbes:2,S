Yeah, looks like a vmalloc leak is occurring. I haven't noticed
it before because:
VmallocTotal: 137427898368 kB
VmallocUsed:   3128272 kB
VmallocChunk: 137424770048 kB
It takes a long time to leak enough vmapped space to run out on ia64...
That tends to imply we have a mapped buffer being leaked somewhere.
Interestingly, I don't see a memory leak so we must be freeing the
memory associated with the buffer, just not unmapping it first. Not
sure how that can happen yet.....
mount xfsVmallocUsed:    177808 kB
unmount xfs
mount xfsVmallocUsed:    178080 kB
unmount xfs
mount xfsVmallocUsed:    178352 kB
unmount xfs
mount xfsVmallocUsed:    178624 kB
unmount xfs
mount xfsVmallocUsed:    178896 kB
unmount xfs
mount xfsVmallocUsed:    179168 kB
unmount xfs
mount xfsVmallocUsed:    179440 kB
unmount xfs
mount xfsVmallocUsed:    179712 kB
unmount xfs
mount xfsVmallocUsed:    179984 kB
Looks like we're leaking 272kB of vmalloc space on each mount/unmount
cycle. I'm trying to track this down now....

Groan - ASSERT(0) is the error handling there for debug kernels. If we fail
to allocate an iclogbuf on a non-debug kernel, it will panic like this.
I'll deal with that later....
Cheers,
Dave.
