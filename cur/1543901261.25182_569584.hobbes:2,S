No doubt.  My point was merely that the closer to the core of
development, the less translated documents help as the emphasis on
interaction *has* to increase.
In that sense, a translation of "Linux Kernel Internals" and the other
books written on the Linux kernel is more useful.  That doesn't mean, of
course, that there isn't documentation distributed with the kernel that
is intended for users and therefore more useful in translation.
However, I do feel that trying to keep up-to-date translations of design
documentation is at least to some degree a fool's errand, which ends up
having people rely on incomplete and outdated documentation, and cut
them off from the overall community.
