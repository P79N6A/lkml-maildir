Use ethtool -S to if there are any pause frames, etc. See if frames are
still making it into PHY statistics but not being received.
Use ethtool -d to dump registers. Need current version of ethtool with decode logic.
Then look for things like is Ram buffer read/write pointer changing?
Is GMAC stuck in pause:
Normal is:
	GMAC 1
	Status                       0x5010  (see GM_GPSR_XXX in sky2.h)
	Control                      0x1800
Stuck is
	GMAC 1
	Status			     0x5810 (or 0x5A10)
