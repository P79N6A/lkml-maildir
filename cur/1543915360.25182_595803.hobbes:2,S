I disagree.  Why would jbd need to globally change the way it allocates
memory?  It currently uses kmalloc (and jbd_kmalloc) for allocating a
variety of structures.  Having to change one particular instance won't
necessarily mean we want to change all of them.  Adding unnecessary
wrappers only obfuscates the code making it harder to understand.  You
wouldn't want every subsystem to have it's own *_kmalloc() that took
different arguments.  Besides, there aren't that many calls to kmalloc
and kfree in the jbd code, so there wouldn't be much pain in changing
GFP flags or whatever, if it ever needed to be done.
