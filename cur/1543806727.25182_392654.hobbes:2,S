In vanilla kernel userland suspend has no security implications: root
can just do what he wants in /dev/mem, anyway.
In fedora kernel, userland suspend can be [miss]used to snapshot an
image, modify it, and write it back. Fortunately, this is going to
take *long* time so people will notice. [Interface changed on DaveJ's
request, now we have separate device, we no longer mess with
/dev/mem]. And similar problem exists in suspend2 -- malicious
graphical progress bar could probably modify memory image on disk.

Please take a look at current -mm series. It has everything neccessary
for your goals.
