Combined mode is a technical term.  Judging from your answers, you are 
not using combined mode.

Judging from your answers, you are not in AHCI mode.
Side note:  You should use AHCI if available.  Emulating a PATA 
interface for SATA devices is error prone [in the silicon].  AHCI is 
native SATA, "enhanced mode" is not.

If the kernel cannot mount the requested root= disk, it tries the 
default that is encoded into the vmlinuz image at build time, which is 
probably 08:13.

Probably, otherwise we would have many more reports like this than just 
yours.
