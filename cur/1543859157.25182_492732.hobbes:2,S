Ok. but i also tried with noop to turnoff disk scheduling effects.
There was still timing differences. Usually i get 3100 microseconds
but upto 20000 microseconds at certain intervals. I am just using
gettimeofday between two writes to read the timing.

Thanks... i will try with CFQ.

Sorry i didn´t understand what you mean.
To minimise scheduling effects i tried giving it maximum priority.
