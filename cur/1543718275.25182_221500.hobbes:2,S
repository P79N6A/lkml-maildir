Not at all! You *do* post useful/helpful/serious/whatnot emails (eg.
those about the corruption-at-page's-end topic). It's just that I like
to see noise on this list going down, which includes announcments eg. of
binutils/gcc, bitkeeper, but also the constant announcments for
yet-some-more-email-addresses-added patches for some rarely used script.
So, let's just try to keep noise low, I won't even send more messages to
this thread (accepting whatever you make out of it), but I'll just
continue hacking DZ11 ...
