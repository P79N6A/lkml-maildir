WAG == Wild Arse Guess..........
You need the heads, sectorsize, and capacity to get cylinders.
Also track size can be useful........

You have to export what ever the partition geometry is or you can not
correctly handle the user-space.
cat /proc/ide/hdb/geometry
physical     6256/16/63
logical      782/128/63
physical is what the drive is truly made of in CHS.
logical is the way the drive is accessed, and can be CHS or LBA.

cat /proc/ide/hdg/geometry
physical     79406/16/63
logical      79406/16/63
This is CHS in both places........how will you deal with this??
Serious question........
