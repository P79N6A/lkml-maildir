Andre,
What are the "laptops that have CFA devices that do not come on channels
in a pair" systems you refer to?
This patch fixes the iopener and other systems here at Lineo that have
2nd drive flash. The only other way we have been booting these is with
"hdb=noprobe" which just disables the 2nd drive flash. hdb=flash does
not fix it.
