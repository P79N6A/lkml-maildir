I have very poor ide disk (and not only ide) preformance (file operations
aren't very slow, but load of system is very big - it's not even possible
to listen music; everything stops during copying of large files). I've
tried all 2.6.0-testX kernels. When I'm copying files, 100% CPU is used
(top says it is i/o wait) even if I'm using only floppy or CD-ROM. I have
Duron 850/256MB SDRAM on motherboard with VIA686B chipset (K7VAT+). It
looks like it's not DMA related problem (it is turned on). And I'm almost
sure, that on 2.6.0-test1 everything was ok. But now, even on test1 (I've
compiled it again) it's still bad.
hdparm settings look like in 2.4.x and they should be right. The only
difference that I've found is many errors in /proc/interrupts.

About 3 milions errors in 10 hours. Is it possible, that all of this is
related to irq errors? What should I do to resolve the problem? 2.4.*
kernels work fine for me.
I'm using Debian/unstable.
dmesg, lspci are here (if you need more information, please let me
know):
