That is one advantage.

Yup, especially this one.  It is not so much "let's make the device
numbers random" but "let's just not care what they are."
We can get to the point where we don't even need the explicit concept of
device numbers, but just "any old unique value" to use as a cookie.  The
kernel can pull that number from anywhere, and notify user-space via
udev ala hotplug.
