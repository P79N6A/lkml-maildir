Not to mention that some (bash the most common) shells have
a PRNG built-in.  As does perl and i'm sure python and any
other higher-than-shell scripting language.
I'm convinced we don't need another device.  This might
still be an alternative (build time selected) for the PRNG
in the existing /dev/urandom if someone is that concerned
with PRNG overhead.
I am curious how someone is going to use random data from a
device in a shell with the possible exception of "dd
if=/dev/urandom of=/some/file" given that they emit a binary
stream not numerals.
