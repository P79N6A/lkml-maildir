Some things won't compile as a module in 2.3.29.  The 2 that I ran across
are ext2 and ide.  Basically it complains about version something (i forgot
now, the error isn't on my screen now).
I don't know if this is the proper fix or not, but I added
#define __NO_VERSION__
at the beginning of drivers/block/ide-features.c and all .c files in fs/ext2
except for super.c
Since the kernel is for a diskless machine I didn't want the above modules
in the kernel.  After booting, I was able to mount 2 ide hard drives using
ext2 w/o problems.  I didn't do anything more than just mounting and doing
an ls in the root of each mount.
