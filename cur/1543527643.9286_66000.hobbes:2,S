Instead of producing such a patch, that is really duplicating
existing information for no real good reason - why not actually
*FIX* the applications that are zombifying?  Any app I've found
that zombies all the time, it is usually a one liner patch that
fixes it.  Of course that assumes that it is open source we're
talking about.  If it is closed source or proprietary however,
then you should pound on your vendor's door and tell them their
application is broken and you want your money back.
Just my $0.02
