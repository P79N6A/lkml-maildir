Looks like the 2.5 makefile is broken. If you didnt include any IDE DMA
support them ide-dma.c should not have been linked into the kernel. 2.4.x
seems to get this right (though I have to fix modular IDE there yet). 
I'll have a look at the rest when I try and get 2.5.60 IDE back in sync
with the newer 2.4 code.
