And on-disk superblock documentation.
I want to be able to recover from a single disk-failure and
power-fail conditions in all cases, not just in 50%.
3ware is simply unable to recover from some situations where recovery
is possible (reported to them at least two times).
Maybe they will understand this sometimes. I think that I have
a right to get my data back if it's possible.
It was extremly hard to explain them LGPL and the
fact that they violated it; so I expect not too much.
To not publish the specs is really extremly unfair;
it just shows how they care about my data.
