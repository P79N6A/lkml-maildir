It seems that whatever is causing the bug i'm seeing was a change that 
involved the network driver/interrupt subsystem and not actually the 
8139too driver, this was done at around 2.6.3-2.6.4.   A NAPI patch that 
was introduced at that time basically reverted the interrupt function 
and removed the poll functions from the driver (via not enabling napi in 
Kconfig).   I have patched 2.6.12.1 with the NAPI patch and it works.  
Now i just have  a problem with messages about "Badness in __kfree_skb 
at net/core/skbuff.c:290" coming from the changes i made in the 8139too 
driver flooding my logs.  (very bad but also helpful)
That narrows it down, but i was unable to clean up the kfree errors.
