Out of morbid curiosity, what's the status of union mounts?  I've had this 
sneaking suspicion that /proc would eventually be broken up into two 
filesystems: 1) what /proc was originally meant for (a subdirectory for each 
pid), 2) all the extra crap that got shoehorned into it back when it was the 
only synthetic filesystem (and after everybody got into the habit of putting 
synthetic fs stuff into /proc).
Of course making this work with legacy tools would require union mounting both 
procfs and crapfs onto /proc.  Which gets us back to "how are union mounts 
doing"?
