I beleive in newer 2.6 kernels that Reiser has ordered mode (IIRC, courtesy
of Chris Mason), but XFS and JFS do not support it.  I seem to remember
Shaggy (JFS maintainer) saying in older 2.4 kernels he tried to write
file data before metadata but had to change that behavior in 2.6, not
really sure why or anything beyond that.
