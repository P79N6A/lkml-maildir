Yep.  That would happen as a side effect of moving the code to 
drivers/ata, even.

If you look at libata-scsi, the code is simply a SCSI simulator that 
calls a _clean_ and _separate_ libATA API.
Other code -- such as a block-layer driver -- could use this same API. 
I think Bart has mentioned he has early code to do this, or at least 
ideas on how to do it.
I made a promise to you, to do it at the block layer, and I intend to 
keep my promise.  :)  It just takes years to get there.  The two main 
reasons for using SCSI were/are:
* provides a bunch of useful _generic_ infrastructure
* has a very high Just Works(tm) value for distro installers and users, 
where code already exists for /dev/sdX.  I learned the hard way with 
drivers/block/sx8.c that adding a new block device involves coordination 
with multiple distros :(
I dream of a /dev/disk, perhaps reusing and expanding /dev/sdX's block 
majors, but that may be unrealistic.
