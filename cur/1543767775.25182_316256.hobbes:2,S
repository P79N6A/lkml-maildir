r8169-new-pci-id.patch was announced in 2.6.12-rc3-mm1. It disappeared in
2.6.12-rc3-mm{2/3} without notification.
The change included in this patch is currently not in 2.6.12-rc3-mm3 as a
whole, nor in -linus as of b2d84f078a8be40f5ae3b4d2ac001e2a7f45fe4f
Is there a reason for the removal ?
On a related note, is it suggested to wait for a renewed -netdev tree or
to feed the pending r8169 stuff to -mm ?
