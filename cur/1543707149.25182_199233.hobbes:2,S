This is the bit I don't understand.
Surely the value of case-insensitivity is that you can type in a
filename from memory and not worry about what case you used when you
created the file.
Yet with Lindows / MS-Windows style interfaces, you virtually never
type the name of a pre-existing file.  So case-insensitivity doesn't
seem to be a win to the user.
I thought the value of a case-insensitive filenames was for
legacy applications which have been written to the WIN32 API and took
lots of liberties with "pretty-casing" filenames between readdir and
open.
