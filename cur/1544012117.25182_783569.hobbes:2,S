Yes, I understand that. So, you're suggesting to put all EOF interrupts 
under 1 irq-number. Just for example: now I have
167:        351     ipu_irq  idmac
174:        752     ipu_irq  idmac
175:          0     ipu_irq  idmac
230:          1     ipu_irq  csi
where 167 - camera IRQs, 174 - framebuffer (panning), 175 - overlay (ok, 
this one will go), 230 - CSI_EOF from IPU_INT_STAT_3 (ok, it is not used 
ATM, can go too).
So, there are at least two valid users of EOF interrupts. And you're 
suggesting to put them on one interrupt, and even not as a shared IRQ with 
two handlers - one interrupt with one handler with multiple sources / 
users behind it... What likely will happen someone will add support for 
YUV / RGB cameras and will want to use hardware processing for them, like 
encoding and / or rotation, which will add DMA channels DMAIC_0, DMAIC_8, 
DMAIC_6, DMAIC_10... and you want to put them all on one IRQ?... What we 
could improve in the above /proc/interrupts output is register interrupts 
with different names to make distinguishing them easier. But I really 
would not like to put them all together.

Good, will remove it then.
