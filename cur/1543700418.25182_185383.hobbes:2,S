Agree, the latency would suck and it wouldn't even work for RT processes.

They might, although they probably shouldn't (band is a bitmask for a
reason).
Anyway, you can handle all these problems by computing the band at
signal delivery time.  Yes it sounds like it would complicate the
signal delivery code, but sigio should really be handled specially
anyway, so that a signal queue entry for every fd is guaranteed and
queue overflow is not possible.  Somebody already has a patch for
that, it might be worth working from.
