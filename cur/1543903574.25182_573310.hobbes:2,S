The patches doesn't fix anything.  If you take a look at git history for
the file, you may find this:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=7f8a894066b826a4baea49c2a3adbba0a56a192f
And if I read the patch correctly, Thomas merely forgot to remove these
two checks on eccbuf.  So the correct patch would remove '&& eccbuf'
from one conditional and nuke the other completely.
Care to send such a patch?
