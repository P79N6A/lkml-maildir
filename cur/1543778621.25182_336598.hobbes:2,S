Update: The system hasn't hanged anymore and has shown stable and fast since 
I've disabled USB 2.0.
Today I've stressed it quite a lot, played with ISOFS, loopback FS, performed 
disk-to-disk backups, burned CDs, used wine and dosemu etc. and it worked 
perfectly. None of the things that caused it to hang yesterday when USB 2.0 
was enabled caused any problem today.
So now it summarizes as :
- Old BIOS, kernel 2.4.x : System perfectly stable (with IO-APIC and USB 2.0)
- Old BIOS, kernel 2.6.12 : With IO-APIC and USB 2.0, "IRQ 21 - nobody cared" 
problems. Disabling either IO-APIC or USB 2.0 causes the problem to 
disappear.
- New BIOS, kernel 2.6.12 : With IO-APIC and USB 2.0, uhci and ehci are now on 
the same IRQ. System doesn't complain anymore about USB or IRQ lost, BUT it 
may completely *HANG* (is unstable) especially under high activity. Nothing 
gets logged or displayed as the system purely and simply hangs.
=> With USB 2.0 completely disabled, the problem seems to disappear and the 
system looks stable again.
Cheers.
