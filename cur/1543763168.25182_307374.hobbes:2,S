Yes. I strongly suspect that your problems are caused by the embedded
controller driver. On many laptop systems, the embedded controller is
used to access and query the batter subsystem. Unfortunately, the driver
code that performs embedded controller reads and writes currently uses a
spinlock to prevent multiple accesses. A typical read/write operation
can take around 2.5 ms, during which no interrupts can be serviced.
I've been trying to make noise about this problem on the ACPI mailing
list, but progress on this issue is still glacial. Luming Yu has posted
a patch to 2.6.11 that appears to resolve the interrupt blocking, but it
has the side effect that embedded controller access becomes unacceptably
slow.
cheers,
Rich
