there's no forced dependency between those two patches :-) So for now 
i've applied the one that saves text and skipped the one that bloats it.

some workloads would call sched_fair uncommon too. To me this seems like 
a workaround for the lack of a particular hardware feature.

dunno, it would depend on the numbers. But really, in most workloads we 
do a lot more VFS indirect calls than scheduler indirect calls. So if 
this was an issue i'd really suggest to attack it in a generic way.
