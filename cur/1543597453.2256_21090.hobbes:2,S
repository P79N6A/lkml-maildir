Hello,
a small problem: On my brother's PC with an Asus P2B and an non-PnP ISA 
SoundBlaster 16 there was a problem with sound not working any more:
His SB used IRQ 5 (hardwired) and he had disabled the USB device in 
BIOS. However SuSE Linux 7.2 detected the USB device and loaded the 
module. As it seemed, even though IRQ 5 was marked as reserved in BIOS, 
the disabled USB device also had IRQ 5. At least that's what the module 
allocated. Later the sound module complained about IRQ 5 not being 
available.
I have no idea what the effect of disabling a device in BIOS means to 
the hardware, or what can be done in the driver about it. I just wanted 
to let you know.
Ulrich
