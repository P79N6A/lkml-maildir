I believe at this point, its moot.  I captured quite a few instances of that 
error message while rebooting the last time, all of which occurred long 
before I logged in and did a startx (I boot to runlevel 3 here), so the 
kernel was NOT tainted at that point.  That dmesg has been posted and some 
questions asked.
As this has gone on for a while, it seems to me that with 14,800 google hits 
on this problem, Linus should call a halt until this is found and fixed.  But 
I'm not Linus.  I'm also locking up for 30 at a time, & probably ready for 
reboot #7 today.
