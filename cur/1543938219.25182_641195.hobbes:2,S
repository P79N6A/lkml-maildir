Subject: [PATCH 53/58] [GFS2] gfs2_alloc_required performance
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Bob Peterson <rpeterso@redhat.com>
This is a small I/O performance enhancement to gfs2.  (Actually, it is a rework of
an earlier version I got wrong).  The idea here is to check if the write extends
past the last block in the file.  If so, the function can save itself a lot of
time and trouble because it knows an allocate will be required.  Benchmarks like
iozone should see better performance.
