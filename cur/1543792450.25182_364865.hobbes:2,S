Hello,
The Linux fstat() doesn't return any information number of blocks,
or the byte-length of a physical hard disk.
       Device name : /dev/hda
     Device st_dev : 00000301
    Device st_rdev : 00000300
    Device st_size : 0
  Device st_blocks : 0
Device st_blksize : 4096
       Device name : /dev/sda
     Device st_dev : 00000301
    Device st_rdev : 00000800
    Device st_size : 0
  Device st_blocks : 0
Device st_blksize : 4096
       Device name : /dev/sdb
     Device st_dev : 00000301
    Device st_rdev : 00000810
    Device st_size : 0
  Device st_blocks : 0
Device st_blksize : 4096
       Device name : /dev/sdc
     Device st_dev : 00000301
    Device st_rdev : 00000820
    Device st_size : 0
  Device st_blocks : 0
Device st_blksize : 4096
So, in a PORTABLE way, how do I find the block device with a
certain size, perhaps even the largest or smallest? I need to
have a customer plug in an external drive (USB) and be able
to determine if it's big enough for a raw-data write (no
file-system).
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
