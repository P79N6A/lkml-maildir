After a quick look at the LD documentation, it seems that wildcards are
supported in the input section names of the linker script. So that the
CALLBACK_SECTION() macro could add the function pointer to a section
named:
   gcm. ## name
(gcm standing for "generic callback mechanism") and then, in the linker
script, do:
   *(gcm.*)
I'm going to try that.
Sincerly,
Thomas
