PS/2 keyboard, X.org 1.3.0 (version is at the top of /var/log/Xorg.0.log, or 
wherever your distribution puts that log), and this xkb config (in 
/etc/X11/xorg.conf):
Section "InputDevice"
         Identifier      "Keyboard0"
         Driver          "kbd"
         Option          "XkbModel"      "pc104"
         Option          "XkbLayout"     "us"
         Option          "XkbVariant"    "euro"
         Option          "XkbOptions"    "compose:rctrl"
EndSection
(you can forget that XkbVariant -- it's not yet in most distributions).
Problem as observed here consists of a sporadically stuck delete key in 
Thunderbird 2.0.0.5, using kernel 2.6.22.1 vanilla -- not yet observed using 
2.6.22.1-cfs-v19.1
