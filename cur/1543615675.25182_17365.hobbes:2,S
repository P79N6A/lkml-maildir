It doesn't really have to be a prime, being relatively prime is also 
good, i.e., not too many or too small factors.  Surely there's a multiplier 
in the right range with just two prime factors that can be computed with 3 
shift-adds.

Right, it's not worth it unless you can get it down to a handful of 
shift-adds.  How does 2**17 - 1 (Mersenne prime #6) with right-shift by
(16 - bits) work?

It would be nice if you could just look up good ones in a cookbook, but you 
can't, that cookbook doesn't exist.
