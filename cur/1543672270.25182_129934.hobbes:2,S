I had a similar problem with SuSE's 2.4.18.  Random processes
seemed to go into D state from whence intr is useless.
I rebuilt the kernel with NFSv3 disabled and that problem
went away.  The logs are full of
    May  5 14:54:15 duncan kernel: NFS: NFSv3 not supported.
    May  5 14:54:15 duncan kernel: nfs warning: mount version older than kernel
but that i can live with.  Processes hung and umount failing
i cannot abide.
If there is a better answer, i'm listening.
