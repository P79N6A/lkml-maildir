This seems to have resulted in all set_rtc_mmss messages vanishing for
me.  It's been a bit over a day so far, and usually it starts displaying
them by now.  I'll give it another day and then try a reboot to see if
the processors deadlock, but for now, it looks good.  Glad to see these
will be in 2.2.13 (I'm running 2.2.13pre9 w/ the SMP time spinlock
patch)
