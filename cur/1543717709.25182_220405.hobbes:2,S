I have picked up a majour bug in kernel 2.6 regerding the Nvidia graphic 
drivers which are cousing my screen to go funny when I halt my machine 
making the terminal to go dodgy but I can still work around it.
It looks like somthing from a old sinclair spectrum when the tape is loading 
or a moron who tried to use a 1024x768 resoultion under a 14" monitor (my 
monitor is 15"!)
