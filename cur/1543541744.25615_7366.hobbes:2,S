Yup, there was a small typo in the patch...
(I think I edited something between booting my
test machine and diffing up the patch .. oops)
If you change the reference to del_page_from_inactive_list
to del_page_from_inactive_dirty_list (in mm/swap.c), the
patch will compile ...
(and crash when you run it too long, there seems to be a
memory leak somewhere ... but at least the code is good
enough now that I can ask others for help in locating it)
regards,
Rik
