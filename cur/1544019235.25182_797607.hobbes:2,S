I would think that the code that's using it for this purpose should be 
changed to do things differently, such as by changing the functions 
using it to make their caller pass in the proper GFP mask. I don't think 
it was ever intended to be used to select allocation behavior like this, 
only for debug warning checks and such.. Getting rid of in_atomic() and 
creating a in_atomic_warn() that just raises a warning if called 
atomically, might be the best long-term solution.
