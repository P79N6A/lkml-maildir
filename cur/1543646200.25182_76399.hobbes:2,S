Well, sadly this is not the case. You can put a medium into a drive and
pull it out without the kernel ever noticing. Unless of course you try to use
the thing. But even in this case there's no hotplug event.
Yet user space and evms have to learn about it in the long term.
Changing a medium can mean that a new type of medium is inserted.
A modern zip drive goes from 100M(ro) to 250M(rw) and even 750M(rw)
We need to know and report.

Your wishes you are entiteled to ;-) Unfortunately this is not a viable

I'll look at the source.

Device management is all right, but volume management operates at the
medium level, or rather in between. What do you do if somebody adds drives
to a SCSI-RAID converter.
Evms currently polls on demand. I see no way to do it differently with
the present infrastructure.
