Summary:
dbench has been intermittantly not completing on uniprocessor.
I run dbench 10 times.  1 of the ten runs has 1 dbench child
that never gets started.  That child is in sys_pause.
2.6.0-test1 and 2.6.0-test1-mm2 did not hang.
2.6.0-test1-ac1, 2.6.0-test1-ac2, 2.6.0-test2, and
2.6.0-test2-mm1 have hung.  So it seems like a patch
that Alan may have picked up first.
The hang has occurred on ext2, ext3, reiserfs, and xfs,
so filesystem type seems unrelated.
pkill -9 dbench will let the processes continue.
dbench version 2.0.
<sysrq-t> from 2.6.0-test2-mm1 before pkill is at:
