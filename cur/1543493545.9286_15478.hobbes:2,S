Hi,
Under heavy load conditions, get_vm_area() might end up allocating an
address range beyond VMALLOC_END. The problem is after the for loop
in get_vm_area() terminates, no consistency check (addr > VMALLOC_END
- size) is performed on the "addr". 
I believe the following patch will fix the problem:

        area->addr = (void *)addr;
        area->size = size + PAGE_SIZE;
Please let me know if this patch is pulled into the source tree, 
so I can update my tree.
Thanks.
