Subject: [PATCH] fix bogus reporting of signals by audit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/3/7

	Async signals should not be reported as sent by current in
audit log.  As it is, we call audit_signal_info() too early in
check_kill_permission().  Note that check_kill_permission() has that
test already - it needs to know if it should apply current-based
permission checks.  So the solution is to move the call of audit_signal_info()
between those.
	Bogosity in question is easily reproduced - add a rule watching for
e.g. kill(2) from specific process (so that audit_signal_info() would not
short-circuit to nothing), say load_policy, watch the bogus OBJ_PID entry
in audit logs claiming that write(2) on selinuxfs file issued by load_policy(8)
had somehow managed to send a signal to syslogd...
