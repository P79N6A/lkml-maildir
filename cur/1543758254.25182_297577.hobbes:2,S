Yes but I want to think about it a bit, I need to go relearn how it
picks the changesets it exports 1:1 to CVS commits vs the csets that
get collapsed into the merge nodes.  I'm worried that more frequent
exports may result yield suboptimal results.  If that's not true then
we'll export it every few hours or every time bkbits.net gets updated.
