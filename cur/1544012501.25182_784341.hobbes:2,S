Can rebase, although that would hide the (deserved) credit that 
Jaswinder's patch deserves. And it does not appear to be a must-rebase 
example to me - it's not like one does sparse builds during bisection.

Linus had reservations about the first version (which got fixed but which 
prevented it from going upstream in the first cycle) - and it's not an 
exactly critical change and other stuff interfered. All our previous merge 
windows were fully filled ;)
