This bug has been around for a while ... it's tracked in bugzilla in
bug 
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=290.
 It needs someone who
will take it up with the gcc folks. 
As for your patches, I don't think working around an obvious compiler
bug in the kernel source is a good idea, except as an interim
workaround.
