You only have 4K safe to use in all current configurations. Its a case
of simply fixing the sloppy code (and or pushing up compiler versions 
where the compiler is the offender).

We've seen no evidence of this and assuming apps could use 4K safely the
interrupt "stack" was about 2.5K before. Limiting it either by size or
by depth is not a big problem at all.
