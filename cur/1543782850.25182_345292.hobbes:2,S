What is that?  It looks totally bogus. Can you tell exactly where you
believe early per cpu data is needed?

And that looks broken too.
In general I would also advise to mix any other changes outside kgdb* into the 
x86-64 kgdb patch. Either the patch should be merged into mainline in a 
separate patch or kgdb reworked to not need this.

I can see the point of that. It's ok if you submit it as a separate patch.
Regarding early trap init: I would have no problem to move all of traps_init
into setup_arch (and leave traps_init empty for generic code). I actually
don't know why it runs so late. But doing it half way is ugly.
