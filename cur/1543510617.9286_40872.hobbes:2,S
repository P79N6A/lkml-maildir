The GNOME project uses the 'gnome-doc' tool to process specially-marked
comments in the actual source code, and generates info, HTML, docbook,
man pages, or text files as output.  I've often thought about suggesting
the import of that tool into the kernel tree as scripts/kernel-doc.
How does that sound?  Using a tool which takes comments from the actual
source code increases the likelihood that the documentation will be
up-to-date.
