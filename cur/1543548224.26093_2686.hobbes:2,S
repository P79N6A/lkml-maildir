   I'd like to explain my point clearly.  My point is that accessing
   with get_user as int is questionable.  In my case, it's string.  I
   don't think all the string argment to the kernel should be aligned.
Thank you for the explanation.
I agree with your logic, but not with the fix you sent here before.
I would much rather see a test for the socket option cases that use
the "val", and in those cases do the get_user calls.  Ie. something
like:
	if (optname == X || optname == Y || optname == Z || ...) {
		if(optlen>=sizeof(int)) {
			if(get_user(val, (int *) optval))
   ...
	}
Could you send me a patch which fixes the problem in this way?
Thank you.
Later,
