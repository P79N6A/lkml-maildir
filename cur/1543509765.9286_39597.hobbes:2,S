Subject: 2.2.12 and missing kernel symbols

For some reason the module I'm working on can't load due to
unresolved kernel symbols (basic ones like printk, io_remap, etc)
on 2.2.12.  This module loads fine when I reboot to 2.2.9.
The symbols are there according to /proc/ksyms, so something
along the way is borked.
Hopefully someone can shed some light on this.
Thanks.
cheers,
aaron
