Subject: [Announce] mountlo 0.5 - Loopback mounting in userspace

I'm proud to announce a new version of my pet project 'mountlo', a
utility which works similarly to 'mount -o loop', but the filesystem
runs entirely in userspace.
While arguably it is quite useless, I like it because it combines some
of my favorite technologies (Linux, UML and FUSE) with very little
additional glue code.
Features:
 o safe mounting of filesystem images for unprivileged users
 o all disk-filesystem types supported in a single binary
What's new since 0.2:
 o support for partitioned disk images
 o support for mount options
 o error reporting both from mount and the kernel
 o achieves reasonable performance using SKAS0 mode of UML
 o verbose and debug modes
An i386 binary (2MB) is available at:
  
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fuse/mountlo-i386-0.5.tar.gz
Requirements for running the binary are:
  - FUSE kernel module.  Since 2.6.14, this is included in mainline
  - FUSE utilities (at least version 2.2).
Compiling from source needs the following components:
   - 
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fuse/mountlo-0.5.tar.gz
   - Linux-2.6.15 kernel source
   - FUSE-2.5 or later devel package (or source installation)
Comments and bug reports are welcome.
