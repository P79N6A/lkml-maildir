       Well, if you're just going to execute it from a shell, a zero-byte
       /bin/true is better, because it won't lock people into using a
       specific shell.
       But who cares about that when you can get into a righteous tizzy
       over wasting FIFTY-SIX WHOLE BYTES on your, umm, 16gb / partition.
