I just recently started getting these errors:
Socks5[9803]: Socks5 attempting to run on interface 0.0.0.0:1080
Socks5[9803]: Bind failed for 0.0.0.0:1080: Bad file descriptor
Socks5[9803]: Accept: Failed to make listening socket
I seem to recall having them before, but not what I did to get
rid of them ;-{
Any ideas?
