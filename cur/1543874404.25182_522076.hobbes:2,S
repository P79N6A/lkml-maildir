But we don't have one that's close.  Let me recap: according to Alan's
definitions, all (presumably all non-RAW) network services must either be
datagram services or stream services, and must be selectable from DGRAM, RDM,
SEQPACKET or STREAM.  RPC is neither.  Also, why does DCCP have its own type?
According to Alan's logic that's superfluous.

Well, perhaps *you* can explain why he's right then...
But, since you insist, I'll just remove any restrictions on the type and drop
SOCK_RPC.  Type 0 will serve just as well since there's only one choice to be
had anyway, and that's all there's likely to be.
