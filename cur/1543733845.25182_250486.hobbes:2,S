Thank you for your advice.
I changed my patch based on your feedback. But I have one
concern about putting "WARN_ON(1);". I'm worrying that people
might be surprised if stack dump is shown on their console,
especially if the broken driver handles many devices.
For example, following console messages were displayed when I
tested my patch by loading/unloading 'uhci_hcd' which handles
two devices on my machine. How do you think?
Thanks,
