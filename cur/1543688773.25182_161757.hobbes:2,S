Oooh - much better.

System time of kernbench is back to what it would be with virgin, or
actually a little less. Elapsed time is still up a little bit, along
with user time, but it's getting pretty close.
Have you looked at Rick Lindsley's schedstat patches? I don't have a
totally up-to-date version, but that might give us a better idea of
what's going on wrt migrations, balancing, etc.
I'll try to get together a broader set of benchmarks and hammer on this
some more ...
