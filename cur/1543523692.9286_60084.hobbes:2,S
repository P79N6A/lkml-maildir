Yes.

I don't think so. (but am not positive)
I don't know what the pIII prefers, but I did 5 test runs with lmbench
today on my p5 with 0,4,16 and 2 additionals with different alignment
CFLAGS.  The difference in lmbench numbers was ~nil for all 5 runs.
The only difference at all (gcc-2.95-2) was that -malign-[foo]=0, gave
me a 48k ram rebate.  My p5 doesn't care about __ALIGN.. and I get free
ram by generally not aligning. :-)
I haven't tested my pIII yet to see if it cares, and if so, what it
prefers.  Someone else probably has.
