I had to flash the BIOS to make this machine even recognize the fact
it had a USB port... (its an old Digital PC 5510), could it be that
perhaps there is something screwy specific to this machine?

device does work on another machine running winduhs.

I'm not sure... in the past I just got oopsen and didn't pay much

No.
