OK, this driver fixes the transfer rate problem. Nice, so I wanted to do 
the right thing, but it didn't work, as you explained... Thanks.
Nevertheless there is still the issue left:
hdparm -d1 /dev/hde makes the drive get major havoc (something like: 
ide: dma_intr: status=0x58 { DriveReady, SeekCOmplete, DataRequest}
ide status timeout=0xd8{Busy}; messages taken from swsups kernal panic
). Have to do a hard reset. I guess it is the same reason why swsusp 
gets a kernel panic when it sends PM commands to siimage.c. (Mybe the 
same error is in libata causing the same kernel panic on swsusp.)
Any clues?
Nice that at least the siimage driver has got some improvement after me 
getting on your nerves. ;-)
