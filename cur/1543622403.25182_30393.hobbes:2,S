Which promptly go kersplat when you feed them into
submit_bio():

Given that I'm hand-rolling a monster bio, I need to know
when to wrap it up and send it off, to avoid creating a bio
which is larger than the target device will accept.  I'm currently
using the below patch.   Am I right that this is missing API
functionality, or did I miss something?
Also, I could not find a way of querying the size of the vector
at *bi_io_vec.  This is also information which would be helpful
when building large scatter/gather lists.
