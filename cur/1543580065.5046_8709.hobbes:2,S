I have pre11 running with Andrea's suggested fix.
        high_queued_sectors = total_ram / 3;
        low_queued_sectors = high_queued_sectors / 2;
        if (low_queued_sectors < 0)
                low_queued_sectors = total_ram / 2;
 
        /*
         * for big RAM machines (>= 384MB), use more for I/O
         */
        /*
        if (total_ram >= MB(384)) {
                high_queued_sectors = (total_ram * 4) / 5;
                low_queued_sectors = high_queued_sectors - MB(128);
        }
        */
Shouldn't it be clean for a 2.4.1 release?
