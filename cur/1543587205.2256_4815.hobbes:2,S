Again, agreed!

The algorithms we have been looking at need to have absolute guarantees
that earlier activity has completed.  The most straightforward way to
guarantee this is to have the critical-section activity run with preemption
disabled.  Most of these code segments either take out locks or run
with interrupts disabled anyway, so there is little or no degradation of
latency in this case.  In fact, in many cases, latency would actually be
improved due to removal of explicit locking primitives.
I believe that one of the issues that pushes in this direction is the
discovery that "synchronize_kernel()" could not be a nop in a UP kernel
unless the read-side critical sections disable preemption (either in
the natural course of events, or artificially if need be).  Andi or
Rusty can correct me if I missed something in the previous exchange...
The read-side code segments are almost always quite short, and, again,
they would almost always otherwise need to be protected by a lock of
some sort, which would disable preemption in any event.
Thoughts?
                              Thanx, Paul
