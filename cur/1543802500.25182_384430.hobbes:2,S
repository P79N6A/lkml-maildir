Good point!
But doesn't the ____cacheline_maxaligned_in_smp directive on the "lock"
field take care of this?  Here is the structure:
/* Global control variables for rcupdate callback mechanism. */
struct rcu_ctrlblk {
        long    cur;            /* Current batch number.                      */
        long    completed;      /* Number of the last completed batch         */
        int     next_pending;   /* Is the next batch already waiting?         */
	spinlock_t      lock    ____cacheline_internodealigned_in_smp;
	cpumask_t       cpumask; /* CPUs that need to switch in order    */
				 /* for current batch to proceed.        */
} ____cacheline_internodealigned_in_smp;
If this does not cover this case, what more is needed?
							Thanx, Paul
