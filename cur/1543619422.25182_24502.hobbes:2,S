Please benchmark on files 10giga large, only do cached I/O (reads are
fine) between 9G and 10G offset for example.
dbench or others handling not very huge files are not interesting
benchmarks for this, for them per-inode rbtree was faster too. the only
problem are the very huge files, the hashtable guarantees the same
performance on small and huge files.
