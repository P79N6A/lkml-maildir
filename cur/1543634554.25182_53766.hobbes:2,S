    Linux RH 7.2, vanilla kernel 2.4.18 with SGI XFS patch 1.1. The test: I
have tried to copy a large file (700MB) from one disk to another and the
effect: after copying for 2 seconds, it stops for 2 seconds and again again
and again... The same situation with vanilla without XFS patch. The problem
dissapears when I use RH's prepared kernel. The friend of mine reports the
same. Where is the point?
