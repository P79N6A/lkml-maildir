Hello lkml,
I have problem with my computer: I have motherboard with AMD690G chipset
and nVidia VGA card. But I cannot set BIOS, to assign for VGA unique
IRQ. VGA card is sharing IRQ with two ohci_hcd (USB 1.1 controllers).
But when I want use for X proprietary nvidia driver, X didn't work with
this errors:
In dmesg:
NVRM: RmInitAdapter failed! (0x23:0xffffffff:678)
NVRM: rm_init_adapter(0) failed
and in /var/log/Xorg.0.log:

I've found in README for NVIDIA, that VGA has to have unique IRQ. I've
tried to set INTERRUPT_LINE and INTERRUPT_PIN with setpci tool, set
pci=routeirq, pci=noacpi as the kernel boot parameters, but IRQ
is still the same.
Is there a way to change IRQ for VGA (or for ohci_hcd instead of VGA)
directly in Linux?
Thanks a lot.
Sincerely
Jan Marek
