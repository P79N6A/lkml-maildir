This is a behaviour change on all of these and limits some behaviour of
existing established security modules
When inode_change_ok is called it has side effects. This includes
clearing the SGID bit on attribute changes caused by chmod. If you make
this change the results of some rulesets may be different before or
after the change is made.
I'm not saying the change is wrong but it does change behaviour so that
needs looking at closely (ditto all other attribute twiddles)
