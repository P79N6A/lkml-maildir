Hi Dave,
There are just too many Linux 2.5 bugs and patches to keep track
of all of them...i.e., you might have looked at the latest in bugzilla,
but not the latest patches on lkml.  I have updated bugzilla #11
with the info needed to build intermezzo in 2.5.51, either as a
loadable module or built-into-kernel.
