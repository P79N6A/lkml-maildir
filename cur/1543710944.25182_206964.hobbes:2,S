But this is then _one_ filesystem, not a stack of them added/deleted in
random order while running. _So_ it is easy... and mostly useless.

As I said: Not too hard, doable. But not sensibly. And needs to mess with
_all_ filesystems (on disk and kernel guts) if they want to someday perhaps
somewhere participate...  Besides, the people asking for this mostly really
want version control, or get what they want from symlink farms.
