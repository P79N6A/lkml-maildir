Has been discussed on this list.  It requires worrisome changes to the
capability system, changes to PAM, changes to login and changes to
applications.

Maybe that's the price we pay for leaving this problem unsolved for a year.
I must say that it's also to some extent a consequence of ISV's and
vendors quitely working on problems in little corners.

There is no magic group unless the admin chooses to set the sysctl.

You misunderstand.  Nasty workarounds will be shipped to end users by
vendors.  That's a certainty.  We cannot change this now.
What I wish to do is to ensure that all users receive the *same* nasty
workaround.  Call it damage control.
