Enabling the "Socket Filtering" option in the 2.2.2 kernel results in
several compilation errors along the line of:
/usr/src/linux-2.2.2/include/net/sock.h: In function `sk_filter':
In file included from /usr/src/linux-2.2.2/include/net/ip.h:39,
                 from slhc.c:71:
/usr/src/linux-2.2.2/include/net/sock.h:796: dereferencing pointer to
incomplete type
If there's another option that needs to be enabled to allow this file
to compile, it isn't obvious from the documentation.
