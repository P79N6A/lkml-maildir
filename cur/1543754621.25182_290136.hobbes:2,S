Just because I can use my arrow keys doesn't mean I can find which part of
a 250,000 line patch broke something.
If it's done as 30 or 40 patches, each of which implements ONE OPTION, then
it's pretty easy to play binary search to find what broke something.
And don't give me "it doesn't break anything" - in the past, I've fed at least
2 bug fixes on things I found broken back to the grsecurity crew (one was a
borkage in the process-ID-randomization code, another was a bad parenthesis
matching breaking the intent of an 'if' in one of the filesystem protection
checks (symlink or fifo or something like that).
