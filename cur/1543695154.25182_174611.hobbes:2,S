The request can be on the wall clock or on clock_monotonic.  Still, we went 
round and round about how a tick on one should be a tick on the other.  My 
understanding is that the pm_timer was put in the ACPIC to handle this, but then 
I don't know how far down power is going, nor for how long.  I would think at 
some point the discontinuity would be large enough that one would want some user 
service to run and "fix" all the broken time assumptions.  Some sort of a soft 
reboot that would kick the ntp code, cron and so on, much as is done at boot.
