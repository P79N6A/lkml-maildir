So the higher-level driver needs to do the sensible thing, i.e.,
resubmit the URB after resume.  It's not rocket science.  The data is
not lost, it's sitting in RAM, and the higher-level driver will send
it out when you resume.  If not, then we fix the higher-level driver.
Of course with USB there is the interesting question of whether the
device is still there when we resume.  But if it isn't, the situation
is no different to the user asynchronously unplugging the device
during operation, and if we lose data in that situation, we can only
blame the user. :)
