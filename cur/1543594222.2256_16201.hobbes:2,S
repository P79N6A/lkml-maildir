Yes, I saw those.  What is the effect of O_NOFOLLOW?  To not
follow symbolic links when opening the file.  If you open a
regular file, in effect nothing happens.  Moreover, if these
opens were not finding files now, the system wouldn't work.
So: the effect, I suppose, is (1) disabling some security
within glibc, and (2) making these accesses slower since they
will be considered O_DIRECT after the change.
Which doesn't seem that life-threatening to me.
