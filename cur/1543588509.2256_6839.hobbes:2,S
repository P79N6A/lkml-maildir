Subject: 2.4.2+3 dies on Epox Athlon Board with Sig11

Hello,
I  have here an epox athlon slotA via board which refuses 2.4.
On Redhat 7.0 kernel 2.4.2 (or was it 2.4.1?)  made the system slow (fsck
the 2GB disc took 
around an hour). 2.2.x runs fine.
Installing Redhat 7.1 results in Sig11 or Sig7 in anaconda.
Anyone with the same problem?
Since it is a productive system, I can't probe much myself :(
Werner
PS: Any idee, why an athlon with 512 MB RAM, a 100Mbit Tulip, rh7 and 3
halflife sessions has 
only a local hl-Ping of 100-500? Are there knows memory lacks or similar? I
first thought this 
system as overkill, but the users report bad pings and e.g. lacks when
someone only logs in with 
ssh :(
