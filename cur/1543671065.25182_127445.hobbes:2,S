Well, if you will read my post - i am trying to use _ONLY_ devfs,
without any demons. Those demons are provided just to keep backward
compatbility (at least this is my opinion) and can be used without them.
i don't like personaly any ideas about udevfs and others. We should get
rid of min/maj nr of each device becouse each single program uses device
by name indeed ! Having just devfs solves many problems and is very good
thing. But, again - without any userspace demons.
Linus was always trying kernel as simple as it is possible, well - imho
devfs is just one step forward to make it even simpler but without
removing any of it functionality.
