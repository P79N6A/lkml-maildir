ok, your variant was more like a ->map_buffer_fn() thing - like the old
md_map() stuff. ->make_request_fn() is closer to 'make request' in the
context of RAID1 and RAID5. (even if this is not visible now).

the cost is only in the device (not in the generic block IO code), it's a
'if (MAJOR(bh->b_rdev) == MD_MAJOR) goto repeat;' type of thing (analogous
in the LVM code), nothing more. We will see how common it gets - it's just
a nice side-effect that th possibility is there.
