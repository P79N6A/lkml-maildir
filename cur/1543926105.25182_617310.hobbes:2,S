The same way we handle some of the multicast "getsockopt()"
calls.  The parameters passed in are both inputs and outputs.
For the above example:
	struct pmd_info {
		int *pmd_numbers;
		u64 *pmd_values;
		int n;
	} *p;
	buffer_size = N;
	p = malloc(buffer_size);
	p->pmd_numbers = p + foo;
	p->pmd_values = p + bar;
	p->n = whatever(N);
	err = read(fd, p, N);
It's definitely doable, use your imagination.
You can encode all kinds of operation types into the
header as well.
Another alternative is to use generic netlink.
