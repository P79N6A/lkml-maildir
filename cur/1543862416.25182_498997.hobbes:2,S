Good to hear. I'd like to get this in ASAP, but in order to make sure
everyone gets a look at it, it'll have to go a round in -mm during the
next kernel.

With the very generous help of John Gilmore, I think we'll have those
sorted out in a jiffy. :)

Eeeeww... This is a problem as the SD spec. clearly states the order of
init commands. So I wouldn't be surprised if we find SD cards that choke
on the MMC init sequence.
I guess what we lose by not supporting these is 8 bit data bus, but as
we do not currently have a controller for that I think the point is moot.
