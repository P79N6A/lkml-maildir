My point is not where oom-killer is triggered. My point is the decision
criteria of oom-killer, when it is finally invoked, which process to
kill. That's kind of independend of your patch. Your patch corrects the
context in which oom-killer is called. My concern is that the decision
critrion which process should be killed is not sufficient. In my case it
kills sshd instead of a process which forks a bunch of child processes.
Thats just wrong, because it takes away the chance to log into the
machine remotely and fix the problem.
