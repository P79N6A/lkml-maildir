Interestingly (we for me at least ;-) I have been
working on an SPI subsystem that was/is a copy of the
I2C subsystem with changes as SPI doesnt have a
protocol like I2C. I am at the stage of tidying up the
structures in the head files and looking at where they
are used in the core layer.
To me, what I have, like I2C, doesnt tie in very well
with the new driver model (although Im not overly
familiar with it, I think I finally understand
platform devices :-). The current I2C core layer seems
to be only registering a bus type and devices so you
can see them in sysfs as none of the functions seem to
do anything.
I wonder how much work the new kernel subsystems can
do for us to cut down the size of i2c-core (and thus
also spi-core).
I guess there is no escaping the fact that Im going
to gave to do some more homework and study the code.
Any thoughts or insights would be very welcome.
