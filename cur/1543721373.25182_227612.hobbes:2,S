The CPU can very easily max out the disks of course. If bonnie is
doing IO to files much larger than memory, it wouldn't be surprising
for io-wait to get close to 100%. Possibly your friend was doing all
IO out of cache?
If you definitely have a performance problem, set "Kernel Debugging"
on in the "Kernel Hacking" menu, then set "Magic SysRq key" on. When
your system hits this iowait problem, press Alt+SysRq+T a couple of
times over a few seconds.
Then post the output of `dmesg -s 1000000`.
We'll see what is waiting where.
