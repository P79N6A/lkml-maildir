This is actually not fundamental at all.
The best-known exception is probably the MAC address. But it is not the  
only example of devices having true unique information.
It is certainly true, though, that there are devices without this kind of  
info.
And remember that you can sometimes use secondary information. With any  
kind of read-write storage device, it might be possible to create such a  
piece of information and store it onto that device.
Moral: keep the identifier creation framework flexible enough so that you  
can chose device-specific means to produce useful identifiers. (And, use  
long identifiers, as they're less likely to be duplicated in general.)
