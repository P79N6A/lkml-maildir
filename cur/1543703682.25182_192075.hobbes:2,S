Name: Block Signals For Early Kthreads
Author: Rusty Russell
Status: Booted on 2.6.1-bk4
Depends: Hotcpu-New-Kthread/use-kthread-simple.patch.gz
D: Kthreads created at boot before "keventd" are spawned directly.
D: However, this means that they don't have all signals blocked, and
D: hence can be killed.  The simplest solution is to always explicitly
D: block all signals in the kthread.
