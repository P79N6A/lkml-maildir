Who would be the primary benifactor of this?
The very large majority of users out there use a distro kernel, and they
provide the ids whenever possible as patches to their kernels, _or_ as a
config option at startup that adds the ids to the drivers through sysfs.

What's wrong with the current sysfs way of adding new device ids without
touching the kernel?  Devices described above was the very reason we
added that functionality, so users would not have to constantly update
their kernel.  The distros provide userspace tools that enable these ids
to be added and at boot time, everything "just works" properly.
So, because of that, I don't really see a need to be adding new device
ids to the -stable tree.

That's a quirk addition, not a new device id following the above
mentioned rules you set out :)
