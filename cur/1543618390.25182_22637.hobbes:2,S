Basically, I have a daemon process which I want to periodically check
a fifo node made with mknod (STAT_FILE, S_IFIFO | 0444, 0) and spit up
a status message.
Something like this:
        writefd = open (STAT_FILE, O_NDELAY | O_WRONLY);
        if (writefd > 0) {
                int len;
                len = give_ctrl_status (writefd);
                close (writefd);
        } else if (errno != ENXIO) {
                error ("Error (%s) reading " STAT_FILE, strerror (errno));
                all_done = 1;
        }
Yay.  All's well until there's multiple processes consuming the message
out of STAT_FILE.
The bash script below simulates the problem.  If there's multiple readers,
only one of them gets the message out of the fifo.  This is not a Linux
specific deal, Solaris does it too.
Here's the output of the script on Linux:
[mjfrazer@frogger fifo]$ ./fifo.test 
after 1000 iterations:
winner[1] = 999
winner[2] = 1
winner[3] = 0
winner[4] = 0
[mjfrazer@frogger fifo]$ uname -a
Linux frogger 2.4.17 #1 Fri Jan 18 16:06:33 EST 2002 i686 unknown
and on Solaris:
[mjfrazer@toronto-fs fifo]$ ./fifo.test 
after 100 iterations:
winner[1] = 19
winner[2] = 18
winner[3] = 16
winner[4] = 47
[mjfrazer@toronto-fs fifo]$ uname -a
SunOS toronto-fs 5.8 Generic_108528-10 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-4
As far as I can tell, I'm borked.  What think the filesystem types
of adding a flag to mknod or something to tell the pipe not to boot off
unserviced readers?
