Well people are always going to operate on this model for commercial
reasons.  FWIW I used to work for a company that stuck to a specific
version of the Linux kernel, and I suppose I still do even now :)
But the important thing is that if you're going to do that, then the
cost that comes with it should be borne by the company and not the
community.
