No. The controller has over-voltage protection, so it just means that it
won't work.
The problem is actually due to a unlucky interface between the low-level
slot driver and the card services layer: there's a flag that says "I'm a
3V card", but there is NOT a flag that says "I'm a 5V card". So what
happened here is that 
 - the cardbus controller did not report any voltages at all.
 - the low-level driver thus did not set the 3V flag.
 - cardservices thought that "not 3V" == "5V"
 - it didn't work.
The fix in 2.3.51 is for the low-level driver to notice that neither the
5V nor the 3V flags were set, and if that happens it will try to force a
re-sense of the card.
I've seen this with the TI1225, and it does not happen with my Ricoh
controller in my Sony VAIO that I did most of the development on. So I
think it's actually a buglet in the TI core.
