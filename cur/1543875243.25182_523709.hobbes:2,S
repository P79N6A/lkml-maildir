well, it's never easy if there are different ideologies

I completely agree here

128 sounds a little small to me, considering that we
already see 300+ Guests on older machines ....

for me, the most natural approach is the one with 
the least impact and smallest number of changes
in the (granted quite complex) system: leave 
everything as is, from the 'entire system' point
of view, and do adjustments and decisions with the
additional Guest/Context information in mind ...
e.g. if we decide to reclaim pages, and the 'normal'
mechanism would end up with 100 'equal' candidates,
the Guest badness can be a good additional criterion
to decide which pages get thrown out ...
OTOH, the Guest status should never control the
entire system behaviour in a way which harms the
overall performance or resource efficiency

that is a good question, and the answer probably depends
very much on what scenarios you are looking at ...

that might easily lead to some ping-pong behaviour,
when two similar guest are executing similar binaries
but not at the same time ...

that sounds interesting ...

all in all I seem to be missing the 'original problem'
which basically forces us to do all those things you
describe instead of letting the Linux Memory System
work as it works right now and just get the accounting
right ...

sorry, I'm more the technical person and I hate
'executive summaries' and similar stuff, but the
message is simple and clear: accouting works even
for shared/unified guests, all three guests show
reasonably similar values ...

I'm confident, a simple comparison can be expected
from folks doing complicate patch reviews and such
but I will try to present a better 'conclusion'
next time ...
best,
