This is very odd. Could you get a backtrace with code addresses resolved
to line numbers?
When you get backtraces, it should show program counters (EIP's on i386,
RIP's on x86-64, other names on others). If you compile with debugging
symbols and keep the vmlinux, you can use addr2line to resolve them to
addresses. Hopefully this is enough for you to go on.
If you can provide this information, it would be very helpful wrt.
resolving your issue.
Thanks.
