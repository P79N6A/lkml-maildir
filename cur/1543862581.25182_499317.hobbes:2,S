I have a kernel that needs to have early hotplug calls to load  
firmware. I just rolled my own simple hotplug scripts to only address  
that issue and have not had a problem since. The mdev in busybox that  
is in the gentoo initramfs didn't seem to be able to handle it, so I  
just made my own scripts. In my case I needed QLogic firmware so root  
could be on FC.
FWIW, it is a real PITA to not be able to build a monolithic kernel  
that can bring up root on its own. I will stipulate that I am an old- 
school guy that likes monolithic kernels, but I do feel that  
something has been lost. Yes, I am aware of the reasons for the  
change, else I would have written something when I was fighting the  
battle, but I still don't have to like it.
