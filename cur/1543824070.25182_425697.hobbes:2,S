Hello,
I am reporting this to the kernel mailing list on the advice of Greg KH.
I would like to report a problem with my ASUS K8N4-E board/CK804 chipset.
Basically, kernels from 2.6.14 do not boot correctly unless I use the kernel 
option
pci=nommconf.  I have tested this with several kernels, including a vanilla 
2.6.14,
2.6.15, 2.6.16 and 2.6.17-rc4.  Searching on google indicated that several 
people
have similar problems with similar hardware - obviously I can't say for sure 
that it
is exactly the same problem, but in at least two other cases, disabling 
mmconfig
enabled the system to boot.
Note that I can also boot by disabling ACPI, which requires me to specify
in the BIOS that the operating system in use is "non-PnP" in order for the
mouse to work.   If I specify
ide=nodma as a kernel parameter, I can boot, but various other components
including the nVidia ethernet (forcedeth driver) do not work.
I have included the end of the messages printed by
the kernel on bootup when mmconfig is not disabled below.  I can happily 
either
post additional information such as .config, dmesg (when the kernel is 
booted
with mmconfig disabled) or lspci output to the mailing list or send it by 
e-mail to
anyone who is interested, but I have not posted anything initially to avoid
clogging up the list.
Please note that I am not subscribed to the mailing list, so I would request 
you to
CC me any answers you would like me to reply to fast.  This e-mail address 
is not
permanent, but I will monitor it at least as long as this thread is 
relevant.
Regards and thanks,
Michael
