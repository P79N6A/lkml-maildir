Hi Ingo,
What are your plans for handling the x86 io_delay stuff?  The current
situation is pretty confusing to someone updating their config from a
2.6.24 kernel, since arch/x86/Kconfig.debug has:
config IO_DELAY_0X80
	bool "port 0x80 based port-IO delay [recommended]"
but also
choice
	prompt "IO delay type"
	default IO_DELAY_0XED
so the IO delay type defaults to something different than the
recommended value.
