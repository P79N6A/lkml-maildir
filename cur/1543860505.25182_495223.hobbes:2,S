that's a fair point, although it's certainly not the coding style
that's in play now.  for example,
  #define setcc(cc) ({ \
    partial_status &= ~(SW_C0|SW_C1|SW_C2|SW_C3); \
    partial_status |= (cc) & (SW_C0|SW_C1|SW_C2|SW_C3); })
there would appear to be *lots* of cases where the ({ }) notation is
used when nothing is being returned.  i'm not sure you can be that
adamant about that distinction at this point.
