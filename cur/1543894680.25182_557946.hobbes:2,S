Could you please look at the message below? I sent it privately near a month
ago, but I think these problems are not fixed yet.

What if tasklet_enable() happens just before this line ?
After the next schedule_tasklet() we have all bits set: SCHED, RUN, PENDING.
The next invocation of __tasklet_action() clears SCHED, but tasklet_tryunlock()
below can never succeed because of PENDING.

TASKLET_STATE_SCHED could be set by tasklet_kill(), in this case it is not nice
to call t->func() again (but probably harmless).
