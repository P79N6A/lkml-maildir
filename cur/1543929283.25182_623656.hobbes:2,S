because we care a heck of a lot more about a widely used open-source 
package's default "user experience" than we care about closed-source 
volanomark scores...
do you realize the absurdity of that suggestion: in essence we'd punish 
firefox _because it is open-source and can be changed_. So basically 
firefox would get a more preferential treatment if it was closed-source 
and could not be changed? That's totally backwards.

We are not at all worried about punishing silly benchmark behavior - and 
volanomark's call to Thread.yield (if that's indeed what is happening - 
could you try to trace it to make sure?) is outright silly. There are 
other chatroom benchmarks such as hackbench.c and hackbench_pth.c that i 
test frequently, and they are not affected by any yield details. (and 
even then it's still taken with a grain of salt - remember dbench)
