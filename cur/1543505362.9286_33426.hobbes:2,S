I'm having problems with making outgoing TCP connections with 2.2.11-pre7
(sorry. have had no time to upgrade to real 2.2.11).
Shot description: outgoing tcp connections to a 2.2.5-22 on the same
subnet usually work just fine but sometimes the connection just hangs
before transmitting any data. The process sleeps in tcp_recvmsg, netstat
shows ESTABLISHED state with empty in/out queues. I tried to reproduce it
and tested about 100 times, no problem. The remote server is a NNTP server
(inn-1.7 IIRC, the one that comes with TH 6.0).
It has happened total 3 times today.
Have never had this problem before. Kernel config unchanged. x86.
