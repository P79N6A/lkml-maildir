	It is very useful to have posibilities to get the state of
translation related variables. Imo we don't have yet the wide UTF support
(in bash, vi, etc) just because there is not such posibility. In any
case the new console driver will be in 2.3 and imho it is not a bad
idea to have this posibilities in 2.2 as well. May be better do it
through the ESC sequences, but imo such posibility realy needed.
The ESC sequences allow to use this posibility not only on local console,
but through telnet or ssh conection, etc. I think I can do this,
but what the question - which ESC sequences have to be used to request
this information and what the format of response sequences ?

	But can't be fixed easily. The N_TTY line discipline does not have
anything to support UTF. For local console I can get information from console
structures, but for something like ssh connection it is impossible. Even we
will have the way to ask console about modes through ESC sequnces it is
has no effect for line discipline. So we need to have in N_TTY its own flag
-utf to treat UTF-8 sequences correctly. But in this case line discipline
utf flag & console utf flag have to be simultaneous. It is easy for local
console, but I don't know how to do it for remote one ?
