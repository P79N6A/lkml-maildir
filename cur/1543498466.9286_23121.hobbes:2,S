No offense, but who really gives a shit if anybody but me and the
programmers use the linux kernel.
People seem to think that having linux accepted into the mainstream makes
it succeed more. I disagree - it just means more people use it...
Certainly nice when it comes to applications and games, but nobody that
matters is going to not use linux because the source that they are never
going to look at has swear words in it.
In fact, I think that its more likely that some big pointy hair will be
thrilled to see a computer message that says "Holy shit, the kernel fucked
up!" because he can immediately understand Something Bad Happened. This is
quite different from having a prompt that says 'login, fuckface:' or
something you see in your computers' normal operation.
In any case, the amount of profanity in the actual kernel isn't enough to
even stop your local (programming?) church from looking through the
source. Those who disaprove of swearing have most likely become quite
adept at ignoring it in real lif. Its the vocal minorities that whine
about such things, which isn't really a big deal.
After all, they are in the minority.
