For what it is worth, I had issues with my SB Live! but as this all
(appeared) to start when my CPU died and I had to reset BIOS or if I
did indeed move up to 2.6.15 at around the same time I can't remember
(2.6.15 release and CPU died all around same date) - refer to the
following:

As stated the solution for me was to update alsa-utils and alsa-libs
which fixed the issues I was getting - I found that if one of the
'controls' (15, I think?) was invalid at boot, all the volume settings
in alsamixer got set to '0' (i.e. mute/turned off) - no sound.
