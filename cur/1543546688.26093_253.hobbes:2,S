Hello all,
Don't know what else to tell you besides:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe  -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=k6
-fno-strict-aliasing
-DMODULE   -c -o emd.o emd.c
emd.c: In function `umsdos_emd_dir_readentry':
emd.c:145: invalid operands to binary -
emd.c: In function `umsdos_writeentry':
emd.c:264: invalid operands to binary -
emd.c:264: invalid operands to binary -
emd.c:264: invalid operands to binary -
make[2]: *** [emd.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.0-test7/fs/umsdos'
make[1]: *** [_modsubdir_umsdos] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.0-test7/fs'
make: *** [_mod_fs] Error 2
Got it in "make modules".  Ask for more information and you shall
receive.  As indicated, the architecture is an AMD K6-II 400MHz.
Thanks!

There are no physicists in the hottest parts of hell, because the
existence of a "hottest part" implies a temperature difference, and
any marginally competent physicist would immediately use this to
run a heat engine and make some other part of hell comfortably cool.
This is obviously impossible.
