In looking over the kernel for preemption hazards I found the following:
The following function is from select.c.  Can someone help me to
understand why do_pollfd() is being called with the task state set to
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE?  do_pollfd() calls the driver poll routine.  Is it
expected that the driver might in some way call schedule() and put the
current task to sleep?  Or would this be a big NO-NO.  I think the state
should be set just prior to the schedule_timeout() call.  Would this
impair some functionality?  The reason I am asking is, if the kernel is
preempted between the two lines in question, the it appears that the
task will be put to sleep, _forever_!  And yes I know the kernel is not
preemptable..._yet_.
If I am correct, then moving the line would also eliminate the need to
set the state back to TASK_RUNNING.

static int do_poll(unsigned int nfds, unsigned int nchunks, unsigned int
nleft, 
	struct pollfd *fds[], poll_table *wait, long timeout)
{
	int count = 0;
	for (;;) {
		unsigned int i;
		set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
		for (i=0; i < nchunks; i++)
			do_pollfd(POLLFD_PER_PAGE, fds[i], &wait, &count);
		if (nleft)
			do_pollfd(nleft, fds[nchunks], &wait, &count);
		wait = NULL;
		if (count || !timeout || signal_pending(current))
			break;
		timeout = schedule_timeout(timeout);
	}
	current->state = TASK_RUNNING;
	return count;
}
