can you give a reference to that? I can't imagine Alan saying that
(probably the negative of the opposite).. since even without using any
kernel headers you can be a derived work (when/how/what is up to
lawyers, but I assume you can agree that it is possible to create a
kernel module that is a derived work even without the condition you
describe) and in that case it HAS to be GPL. Alan isn't alone in the
position to make that exception, you'd need permission from all kernel
authors, but I also find it sort of hard to believe he said that.
