Hi,
I keep the number of free inodes and a pointer to inode bitmap in the
private (fs-specific) superblock info inside super_block. Now, if one
engine creates a new inode and another frees some other inode then we have
a race. 
Do I therefore need to lock/unlock_super(sb) manually in those methods?
I see unlock_super(sb) at the end of minix_new_inode() but I don't find
the corresponding lock_super(sb).
The only lock taken at the VFS level is lock_parent() so two things with
different parents can still corrupt super_block info.
So, the question is - is it right to lock/unlock_super(sb) in
XXX_new_inode()/XXX_free_inode() or do I need to invent my own lock for
this purpose (or do I need no locks at all for some magical reason that
currently escapes me)? (and where is lock_super for the unlock_super in
minix_new_inode?)
Thank you,
