hmm...i'm still not clear on this. in patch #5 you have:
+static void marker_bprintk_probe(void *probe_private, void *call_private,
+		const char *fmt, va_list *args)
+{
+	struct marker_bprintk_struct *p = probe_private;
+
+	if (p->fmt_state == MARKER_FMT_LACK) {
+		int flen = strlen(fmt);
+		if (p->fmt - p->name + flen < MARKER_NAME_FMT_LEN) {
+			memcpy(p->fmt, fmt, flen + 1);
+			p->fmt_state = MARKER_FMT_OK;
+		} else
+			p->fmt_state = MARKER_FMT_INVALID;
+	}
+
+	if (p->fmt_state == MARKER_FMT_OK)
+		trace_vbprintk(0, p->name, *args);
+}
+
trace_vbprintk first argument is 'ip'. So I don't see how we are
associating instruction pointers with each 'ftrace' record? Aren't we
just recording each entry with '0' for the 'ip'?
