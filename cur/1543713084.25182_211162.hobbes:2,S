It's expected.  Right now it just makes sure the address translates to a
valid pfn.  Figuring out whether there are actually pagetables
underneath that address would require a pagetable walk.  
Don't we unmap things when they are free'd with CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC? 
I guess we could add a pagetable walk in the debug case to
virt_addr_valid(), but it would probably make CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
even more of a dog than it already is.
