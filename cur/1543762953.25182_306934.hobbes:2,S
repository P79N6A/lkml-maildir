Quote from VIA RNG crypto analysis:
"Bitrate. The RNG generates output at significantly
higher rates than most PC-based randomness resources.
Raw bits are produced at rates of 30 to 50 Mbits/sec,
and whitened bits were observed at rates of 4 to 9
Mbits/sec. Variations in output rates depend on the
RNG configuration and the oscillator rates. PRNGs
seeded with the Nehemiah RNG should be able to
easily sustain output in excess of 2 Mbits of entropy per
second, which should eliminate blocked PRNG reads in
virtually all applications."
While raw bits reading from hw_random on the fastest 
VIA boards can exceed 55mbits per second 
[above quite was taken from VIA C3 Nehemiah analysis], 
it is not evaluated in rngd and is not written 
back to the /dev/random.
David provided his patch exactly because of
"Adding this can dramatically improve the performance of 
/dev/random on small embedded systems which do not 
generate much entropy."
and it works.
