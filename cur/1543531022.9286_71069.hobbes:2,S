   This is actually something for the Makefile and config hackers to ponder
   actually: being able to pack a 2.4 extra module as source so that the
   end user (or their rpm, dpkg, slp,... tools) can type Make and the Make
   script can grab all the needed config from the kernel .config and module
   syms that are already present
What would be *really* nice is if there were a file, say for example,
/usr/src/linux/modules/Rules.make which could be simply included by
stand-alone module maintainers in their Makefiles so they can grab all
of the right .config and module symbols.
