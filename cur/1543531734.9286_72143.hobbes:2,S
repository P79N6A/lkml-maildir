Another fyi, from a March 6th mail to the ACPI4linux list from andy
henroid:
> A new version of acpid is now available from

http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Hardware/3165/
> 
> and soon after at the main ACPI4Linux website.
> 
> The changes from the last acpid release are primarily
> internal and will have little user-visible effect
> for now (significant parser/interpreter cleanup,
> additional interpreter functionality, and better
> stability running control methods)
> 
> Though not immediately apparent, this is a large
> step forward for the interpreter and soon battery
> and thermal support will follow.
A further acpid update was announced on March 17 also contained mention
of battery handling:
> A new version of acpid is now available from

http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Hardware/3165/
> 
> Changes
> * Added framework for interfacing between userspace
>   clients and acpid
> * Cleaned up the build process
> 
> These changes will have little user visible effect.
> I am still in the process of tracking down a parsing
> regression on BH6's (S5 was working before but
> now is marked as unsupported).  Also, working
> towards thermal and battery support.
