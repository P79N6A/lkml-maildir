let me guess: -j3 is the one that gives the highest performance boost on a 
2-way/4-logical P4 box?
for the SMT/HT scheduler to give any benefits there has to be idle time -
so that SMT decisions actually make a difference.
the higher -j values are only useful to make sure that SMT scheduling does
not introduce regressions - performance should be the same as the pure
SMP/NUMA scheduler's performance.
