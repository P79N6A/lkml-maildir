(this covers both quoted questions above)
The PIO function assumes that PCI IDE-like ATA register blocks (command 
registers, control registers) are available.  The read-log-page function 
can make no such assumptions.
dev-select and check-status should both be done by the machinery that 
occurs once you start things in motion by calling ata_qc_issue().
Doing things this way is necessary for FIS-based hardware like AHCI or 
SiI 3124.

I was talking about depth.  In libata, it's a policy decision to never 
use more than 31 tags at any given time.
You can change it from 31 to 32 in SuSE for value-add, if you wish :)
Note also that error handling occasionally needs a command slot, so the 
limit may even be 30 (or 31 at most).

You can definitely handle both FPDMA and non-FPDMA with a single 
variable.  Think harder on this one.  You have flags to work with, you 
know...
