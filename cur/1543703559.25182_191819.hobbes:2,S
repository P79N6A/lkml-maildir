Hi Paul,
On reflection, I reverse my position -- this should really be done in
bitmap_clear et all as an attribute of bitmaps in general, rather than
as something local to bitmap_parse.
Right now, the bitmap functions treat the unused bits as a kind of
garbage dump.  For example, bitmap_complement() flips every bit in
the set of unsigned longs.  Therefore it is somewhat meaningless for
bitmap_parse, alone among the bitmap functions, to treat the unused bits
as something special.
