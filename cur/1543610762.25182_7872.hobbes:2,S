Actually the original poster used "magic" and I didn't quibble, but I
believe you're right. I just noted that it is better to check to see if
the filesystem is FAT before reporting the error message. Obviously this
can be done, since you don't get the message with FAT as a module, I just
haven't looked to see if the check is in the module or the kernel before
even loading the FAT module.
Thanks for noting that, in any case.
