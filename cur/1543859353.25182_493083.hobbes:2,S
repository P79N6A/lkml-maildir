Hmmm, OK, do people have a use for these values?

No thanks. Yours truly, the maintainer of "ps", "top", "vmstat", etc.

/proc/*/stat is the very best place in /proc for any per-process
data that will be commonly needed. Unlike /proc/*/status, few
people are tempted to screw with the formatting and/or spelling.
Unlike the /sys crap, it doesn't take 3 syscalls PER VALUE to
get at the data.
The things to ask are of course: will this really be used, and
does it really belong in /proc at all?

Since we already have a struct defined and all...
sys_get_rusage(int pid)

Yeah, big time. Things are quite bad in /proc, but /sys is a joke.
