Hello All,
    I believe that I have found a problem with the
2.3.33 kernel.  The attached
program does a write() call that causes the process to
become uninteruptable
and to consume large amounts of CPU.  The only way I
found to kill it was to
cut off the machine (fsck loved that).  I am sure that
my program has a bug,
but I do not think it should be able to do this to the
kernel.
To reproduce this do:
    gcc -g nts.c
    cp jtags ttags
    ./a.out ttags
Please be sure to regenerate ttags each time you run
since the program modifies
its contents.
    I am running this program on an ext2 file system
with 4K blocks.  I am
using a Red Hat 6.1 distribution and a 2.3.33 kernel.
Thanks,
Jim
