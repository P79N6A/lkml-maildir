Pavel, thanks for your reply. I already started to be afraid that
kernel code makes such strange expectations.
Inlining. Yes it explains a lot. It is the difference between -O
and -O2.
BTW the kernel compiles and links without inlining (with -O). It
just doesn't work ;-) Interestingly enough I have had the bad habit
of using -O as compile speed up factor for pretty long time while
working on 2.2.x ..
