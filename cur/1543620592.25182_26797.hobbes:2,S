Hi,
you're right. Both options don't (yet) work together.
I have a new version of sisfb around the corner (partly new code from
SiS themselves). The code is currently in a testing phase and will be
committed as soon as it is stable.
The goal is to have the same code basis for the sisfb as well as the X
driver. This is under development - and it will solve the issue you
described as well.
For the status of the current development, see
