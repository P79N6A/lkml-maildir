Okay, I finally got around to testing this on 2.4.4-pre1. for the 5 or so 
minutes I've been using it so far, it seems okay (I'm able to log in this 
time), and I'm running NetPIPE to check performance.
Perfomance isn't great (the peak bandwidth is 65 Mbps or so), but this
could be partially due to my switch or the other machine I'm testing it
with.
