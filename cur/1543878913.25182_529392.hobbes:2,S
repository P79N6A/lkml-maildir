I can think of one (admittedly insane) FS that is between those two:
3/ an unsorted hash table, where each directory entry has an indirect
pointer to its neighbor in case of hash collisions.
   a
   b -> d -> c -> e
   g
   f -> x
Given 'c' as the "last" thing returned, you can hash c to find out
that you are in the bucket with 'b', but if 'c' was deleted, the best
you can do is return b twice or skip the chain entirely.  I maintain
an out-of-tree driver for such an fs (I promise I did not invent it);
the best I could come up with is to encode the hash chain index in the
top byte of f_pos.   Needless to say, readdir is very not performant
with all the seeking this hash scheme entails.
