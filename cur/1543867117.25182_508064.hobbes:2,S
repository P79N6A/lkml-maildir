I like the idea, my only concern would be potential confusion.  That is, 
the list_for_each macro sets pos to each list_head in turn where 
array_for_each just sets the index /in to/ the array.  While I think the 
way you have is nicer, for compatibility between the two styles maybe 
something more like
  #define array_for_each(element, array) \
	for (int __idx = 0; __idx < ARRAY_SIZE((array)); \
		__idx++, (element) = &(array[__idx]))
would help.  Of course the other option is to name array_for_each 
something different to avoid comparisons with list_for_each.
