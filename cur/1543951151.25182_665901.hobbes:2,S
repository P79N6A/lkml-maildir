AFAIK clobbering ebp is silently ignored on the GCCs I've tried it
on (regardles of frame-pointer ommission). Hence there is a hard-coded
push & pop for that register.
Please also note that these are not clobbers in the strict inline asm
syntax, but rather dummy output values that correspond to actual
input parameters. I'd consider this a serious compiler flaw, if not
bug, if these would not work. But let's not get into GCC vs.
Fancy-inline-asm-hacker flames, like the mplayer folks do ;-)

As I've said, I do not expect this to be problematic, but will test,
just to be sure!

Yes, but it is unneccessary overhead as the compiler can (should!)
find more elegant ways to get those registers back if needed.
