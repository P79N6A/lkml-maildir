Hi,
I have the following configuration
  --------------        ------------
  |            |        |          |
  ¤ eth1       |        |          |
  |       eth0 ¤ ------ ¤ eth0     |
  ¤ eth2       |        |          |
  |            |        |          |
  --------------        ------------
   A Linux Box	        B Linux Box
I would like that the B Linux Box receive and emit OSPF Packets through 
eth1 and eth2 interfaces of the A Linux box. Unfortunatly, it is said in the 
litterature that the packets from 224.0.0.0 to 224.0.0.255 cannot be forwarded 
(OSPF Packets have the 224.0.0.5 address).
Is this rule coded in the kernel ? (where ?)
(I had searched but not found it ... is this hiden somewhere ? )
Cheers,
Michael.
