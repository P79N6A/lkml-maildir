Yes it is okay since no one else can use the slab at this point.

Right.

new_slab() enables and disables interrupts during usual operations. During 
bootstrap interrupts are enabled and so new_slab() falsely disables 
interrupts when we do the alloc by hand thing in early_kmem_cache_node_alloc
for NUMA. We need to enable interrupts there since otherwise boot will 
continue with interrupts disabled.

Yes that should make the lock checker happy since interrupts are disabled 
when calling add_partial(). local_irq_enable can be called later without a 
problem. Useless longer interrupt hold off though.
SLUB: Make lockdep happy by not calling add_partial with interrupts 
enabled during bootstrap
If we move the local_irq_enable() to the end of the function then
add_partial() in early_kmem_cache_node_alloc() will be called
with interrupts disabled like during regular operations.
