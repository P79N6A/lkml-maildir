I defininitely agree with that and I appreciate that you acknowledge my
requests when the bkcvs didn't exist.
(I was also using cvs for kernel development way before I ever heard of
bitkeeper too, then I had to giveup because it was too slow to handle
branches)

that is not accurate, you also asked us to giveup the freedom of
development in your area. And I wouldn't be too interested in a closed
software anyways but at least I could consider using it in the meantime
without feeling tainted.
NOTE: I'm not asking you to remove that clause, nor I'm complaining
about it, I would feel bad for you if you had problems because you
removed that clause. I perfectly understand why you put that clause in
and it makes sense to me.

It's because I grow up that I can actually better understand the deals
it's in my own (again speaking only for myself and not for anybody else)
interest to avoid.
(changing email address as well to make it clear I'm speaking only for
myself here)
Last but not the least, if I was required to use bitkeeper as part of my
job, then I would use it and I'd giveup that bit of freedom, but as far
as I'm free to choose, I will avoid it. But that's my own choice, it has
nothing to do with anybody else.
