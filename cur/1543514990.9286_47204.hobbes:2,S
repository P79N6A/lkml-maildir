Is it even useful for `find'?  A good find implementation does not
stat() everything.

I'm wondering if a generic flag, either to open() or the new getdents
replacement (with d_type support) would be appropriate.
It would mean: "populate dentry cache and/or use READDIRPLUS over
NFSv3".  In other words: "we're going to be doing lots of lookups in
this directory".
