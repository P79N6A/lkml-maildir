Thanks.
Unfortunately, I've got a couple of other problems.
In my testing I managed to panic the kernel further on, somewhere in
selinux. The scenario is slightly different though, running autofs
version 5 against a version 4 module. I really can't see why, all the
references look OK. I'm not sure what can be done it either as we're
talking about an older kernel anyway.
My other problem is I can't get my -mm kernel to build atm so I can't
really test further. I'm sure that will change soon.
