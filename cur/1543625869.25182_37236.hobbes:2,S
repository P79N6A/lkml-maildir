You mean typedef unsigned long flags_t;
However, people will still write:
{
	int flags;
	save_flags(flags);
because 'int' is faster to type than 'flags_t'.  About the only way
you're going to stop it dead is to do:
   typedef struct { unsigned long val; } flags_t;
and then save_flags(x)/restore_flags(x) use (x).val
