Wasn't there a patch submitted which suggested to add pci_dma_prep_*()
calls in order to sync the cpu-driven changes back to the bus? I'm asking
because I'm dealing with a driver that needs to reuse streaming pci maps.
IIRC my impression was you might be willing to accept this for inclusion
but maybe I'm wrong or it got lost during the long "dmabuf inside struct
may cross cacheline" thread shortly thereafter.
Do you think it would be a good idea to add some nooped pci_dma_prep_*()
calls at the right place and expect them to represent some future 
solution?
