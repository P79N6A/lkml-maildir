KVM is a user for that. Because it registers a memory area in which
the host will be continually writting to (the clock), when it
shutdown, the host
have no way to know it has to stop. If you're really shutting down,
there's no problem. But if you're kexecing, for example, the host will
keep writting to a random
memory area after the new kernel installs.
