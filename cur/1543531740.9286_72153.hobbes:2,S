No! Look, you've been told this probably a half dozen times. If the system
crashes it's due to a bug in handling OOM situaions, which has NOTHING to
do with overcommit.

No, that's NOT TRUE.
If you run out of a resource, the system should not crash. The kernel just
has to free up the resource. A convenient way of doing that is to kill a
user process.
This is COMPLETELY independent of overcommit. You have to deal with
resource starvation the same way in a non-overcommitted system as well.
