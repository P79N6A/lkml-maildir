   Oh well, what about something like the following?
 ...   
   +	 */
   +	if (!try_module_get(THIS_MODULE))
   +		return -EBUSY;
Ahem... Why don't we just do this right? :-)
By this I mean provide some real registry thing in the
main kernel image that we can use to do try_module_get()
outside of the sunrpc module?
The other option is the make more progress in the area of
two-stage module unload, and allowing cleanup() to return
whether the module is unloadable or not.  This is being
discussed on netdev so that we have some way to make ipv6
modules work sanely (instead of putting try_module_get() in
every other line, that simply isn't acceptable).
The situation in rxrpc looks worse btw...
