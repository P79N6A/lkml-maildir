Subject: /dev/hdl not showing up with 2.6.8-rc2-mm1

I have an x86 setup with a large(9) number of ide hard drives. With 
2.6.8-rc2, all of them show up (as a,b,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k, and l), but on 
2.6.8-rc2-mm1, the last one (hdl) does not show up, even though it's a 
slave on the same controller as hdk. Everything about the config is 
identical between the two. Is there some default limit or other 
restriction in the current mm kernels that's preventing that drive from 
showing up? I haven't tried any other recent mm kernels, so I don't know 
when this was introduced.
