  Hello.
  As I mentioned in previous mail to account quotas in
bytes and not in blocks (needed for reiserfs) I need to
know something like i_blocks but in bytes. So I added
field i_bytes to inode. This field is used along with
i_blocks and means (number of used bytes) % 512 (size
of block used in i_blocks).
  This solution has advantage that we added only 16-bits
to structure and we needn't to update any block oriented
filesystem...
  Another thing needed is to propagate somehow this entry
to struct stat so quotacheck may account bytes properly.
Whom should I ask to propagate needed changes to libc?
			Thanks for answers.
