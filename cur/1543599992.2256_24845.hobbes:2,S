         Hello there, i just came with some benchmarks:
   Done on p166-24M
   No flames please - i know these were low VM loads, i did this just to know 
how big is test rmaps maitenance overhead. It shows us that even on low VM
load there is a huge win in using rmap. And the win increases with the VM load.
   Algo:
      - booted ac12
      - performed test A 7 times, then test B 7 times.
      - booted ac12-pmap2
      - performed test A 7 times, then test B 7 times.
      * each test was done 7 times, with the lowest and highest thrown away.
      * due to high values of data and streaming usage pattern caching was 
 unable to affect results, so it was ignored.
test A:
"time find / -xdev" + (standard junk eating ~6% cpu (top procinfo))
  descr: extremely low VM load, mostly IO dependent
test B:
"time find / -xdev | grep --regexp="\/" | xargs echo" + background mpg123 +
 + standard junk described above
  descr: low, although higher than A, vm load (nearly absolutely no swap)
Results:
        ac12            ac12-pmap2
