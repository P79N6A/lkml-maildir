Not to mention that 5 second obviously implies it can't be cron (given
that it runs once a minute), and points to bdflush, since that is the
flushing interval.
Now, on my home box, If I run /bin/sync, the disk seeks, whether there is
data to write or not. Before you point to me that I need to mount noatime
- already done :) I think it also did this when bdflush told it to sync,
but after installing noflushd (and hacking the b0rked init scripts),
all was fine. At least, until I installed ext3 :(
