I think you found an old remanent of something that's not used
anymore. It exists even in 2.2.15:
./net/unix/Makefile:tar:
./net/802/Makefile:tar:
./net/appletalk/Makefile:tar:
./net/ax25/Makefile:tar:
./net/core/Makefile:tar:
./net/ethernet/Makefile:tar:
./net/ipv4/Makefile:tar:
./net/ipx/Makefile:tar:
./net/netrom/Makefile:tar:
./net/bridge/Makefile:tar:
./net/lapb/Makefile:tar:
./net/x25/Makefile:tar:
./net/rose/Makefile:tar:
./net/wanrouter/Makefile:tar:
./net/irda/Makefile:tar:
./net/irda/compressors/Makefile:tar:
./net/irda/ircomm/Makefile:tar:
./net/irda/irlan/Makefile:tar:
`make -C $dir tar` is never executed from the top Makefile
so it will never happen.
