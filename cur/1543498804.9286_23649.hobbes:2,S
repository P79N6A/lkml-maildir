Some BIOSes have the capability of creating a hole within memory just
for supporting legacy ISA cards.  My FIC PA-2013 has such an option,
although only for 14-16M or 15-16M hole.

In fact, I activated the memory hole feature when setting up my machine
and ended up with Linux detecting only 14M.  It took me a few days to
notice that I was running on vapors...
Which makes me wonder why Linux doesn't support this situation, and where
I could find info that would let me fix it.
