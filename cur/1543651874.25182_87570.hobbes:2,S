Hmmm. Ok, How about something like what is below? This is very similar
to what James is suggesting, but tries to fix some of the corner cases
as well. The only problem I see with this is that in some places we're
using _X86_PIT_TIMER as an imagined !_X86_TSC_ONLY, so one couldn't have
a kernel that compiled in the Cyclone timer, not the PIT timer, and
allowed one to disable the TSC. 
I'm still not sure this is the way to go, but at least gives James a
chance to poke at my code rather then the other way around. 
thanks
