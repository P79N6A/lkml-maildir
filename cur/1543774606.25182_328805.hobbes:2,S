It shouldn't break it, Paulus and Egbert were at least talking about this
stuff, Paulus gave me an easier to integrate patch and worked with me to
get it in shape, my next plan was to start taking pieces of Egberts work
for the other cards and putting it into the kernel...
Egberts work also fixes some problems in userspace but these aren't any
concern of mine really and those fixes need to be put into the Mesa and
X.org trees, it also makes sure backwards compat is better satisfied as
more people will test with a new/old combination..
Dave.
