For me, it doesn't work at all with ide-scsi in 2.6. 2.4 is fine
in that regard.

There is a patch by me with some rework by Jens Axboe in -mm that
corrects this situation. It hasn't seen much testing, though.
By the way, what hardware sector size does your MO use? I have
only tested my patch with 2048 byte sector size - everything else
is unlikely to work with ide-cd...

Please fill the whole disk and then reread and compare via ide-scsi.
That never worked for me in 2.6 using ide-scsi, but it does work
with the patch in -mm.
I agree that the situation in mainline as it is now is undesirable,
only mounting prewritten discs read-only works.
