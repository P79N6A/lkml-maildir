LLDDs having their own domain discovery code is definitely a misfeature.
As you know, stuff is being rearranged to move more of the SPI-specific
code from both SCSI core and LLDDs into the SPI transport.  I suspect
domain discovery will always be triggered by the LLDD for SPI, but at
least a driver doesn't have to have its own code to do that any more.
