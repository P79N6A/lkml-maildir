Subject: mincore returning -ENOMEM instead of -EFAULT

Linus,
	Your fix in commit 2f77d107050abc14bc393b34bdb7b91cf670c250
modifies sys_mincore() to return -ENOMEM instead of -EFAULT on a totally
bogus address.  Was this intentional, or is it something that should be
fixed up?
-       /* check the output buffer whilst holding the lock */
-       error = -EFAULT;
-       down_read(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
+       /* ..and we need to be passed a valid user-space range */
+       if (!access_ok(VERIFY_READ, (void __user *) start, len))
+               return -ENOMEM;
Joel
