  Hmmm, yeah, it currently cannot happen, and if what you're describing 
is a requirement, everything should be okay.  But, I still think that 
using separate timer will be better as it won't add any overhead (with 
the change you proposed) and it makes the somewhat unobivous requirement 
go away.  Or at least add BUG_ON() test or something to make the 
requirement clear.
  What do you think?
  Thanks.
