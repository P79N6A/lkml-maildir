Not really.  There's two types of fixup (well, four if you multiply by
the header vs later possibility).  There's the incredibly specific ("this
device from this manufacturer forgets to set something properly") and
the incredibly general ("if this is a cardbus / IDE device, then ...").
This patch simply distinguishes between the two.  Obviously the general
ones run after the specific ones -- there's specific devices that forget
to set their class code, for example.

I don't want to call it "final final" at all.  Did you miss the message
where I explained the problem with this being link order dependent?

I already apologised to you on IRC for that yesterday.
