That shouldn't be too hard. While burning a CD, see the priority 
cdrecord is running at. You can use:
ps -eo pid,user,args,pri | grep cdrecord
Also see if you have cdrecord installed suid root:
ls -l `which cdrecord`
If you do, you can be pretty sure that it runs at the highest possible 
realtime priority. This is hardcoded in cdrecord. It does it if it runs 
priviledged.
