Just for a lark, I tried using NAPI polling, while disabling all TX
interrupts. Performance was a disaster: 8Mbits/sec, fom which I conclude
that the tcp ack packets do not flow back fast enough to allw reliance
on NAPI polling for transmit.
I was able to get as high as 960 Mbits/sec in unusal circumstances, 
at 100% cpu usage. Oprofile indicates that the next major improvement
would be to add scatter/gather, which I'll take a shot at next week,
if I don't get interrupted. However, I'm getting interrupted a lot these
days.
