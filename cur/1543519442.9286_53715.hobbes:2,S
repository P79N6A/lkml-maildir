my computer has

mother card is CM ASUS P2B-F 440BX 2isa/5PCI 1 AGP 4DIMM ATX
128 SDRAM

1 NE2000 card
1 ensoniq 1371 (sound card)
1 Ati works (mach 64)
1 old olivetti jp150
I have search the patch for my SCSI card in
ftp://ftp.tekram.com/SCSI/390X/Linux/Redhat/Redhat61/
Now I have a Redhat 6.1 with 2.2.13 kernel, I compile it with the
tekram's patch. But since I have Linux ( jully), I always have trouble
with it... In fact it's rare that my computer work  more than 12 hours
without big problem (I mean no ctrl alt F?, no mouse, nothing)
Today I schould reset three times my computer, I was trying to burn a CD
with cdrecord. ( Cdrecord release 1.8a35 Copyright (C) 1995-1999 Jörg
Schilling ) I compile it with the source that I find
http://www.fokus.gmd.de/nthp/employees/schilling/cdrecord.html
 . A lot
of people say to me that cdrecord was stable so I think that I have a
problem on my systeme...
Is it the patch from  tekram, or the multiprocessor that crasches Linux
so ?
