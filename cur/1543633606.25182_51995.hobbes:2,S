Yup. The simplest way I see here is to have a device automatically
inherit, by default, his parent device ones. The arch will provide
default "root" allocators, so a fully coherent or fully non-coherent
arch may not have to do anything but these.
Now, if a given bus in the arch need specific quirks, it's up to
the bus device node to put it's own versions to be used by it's
childs.
Ben.
