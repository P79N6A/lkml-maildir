Thanks to everyone who replied - I am using a module from source forge, 
on my hp laptop,
called omnibook. It allows me to turn off the back light on my n5430. 
Below is the
function that uses isa_memcpy_fromio().
static int __init dmi_iterate(void (*decode)(struct dmi_header *))
{
    u8 buf[15];
    u32 fp=0xF0000;
#ifdef CONFIG_SIMNOW
    /*
     *      Skip on x86/64 with simnow. Will eventually go away
     *      If you see this ifdef in 2.6pre mail me !
     */
    return -1;
#endif
    while( fp < 0xFFFFF)
    {
        isa_memcpy_fromio(buf, fp, 15);
        if(memcmp(buf, "_DMI_", 5)==0 && dmi_checksum(buf))
        {
            u16 num=buf[13]<<8|buf[12];
            u16 len=buf[7]<<8|buf[6];
            u32 base=buf[11]<<24|buf[10]<<16|buf[9]<<8|buf[8];
            if(dmi_table(base,len,num,decode)==0)
                return 0;
        }
        fp+=16;
    }
    return -1;
}
Would someone recommend how this should be changed?
Thanks,
Steve
