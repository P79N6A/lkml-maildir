I doubt Micro$oft actually did the innovation there.  After all, Apple now
sell an optical mouse with similar capabilities, but with an innovative
overall design (almost the entire upper surface forms the button!).
Optical mouse technology has been developed continuously (with a fairly low
profile) since the early models found on those Sun workstations, and both
Micro$oft and Apple simply put said technology into their latest products.
Maybe I'm biased, but I think Apple did a better job of it.
