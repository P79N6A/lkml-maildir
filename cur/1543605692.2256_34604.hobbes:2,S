  You are probably correct, but you might try running as a user other
than root, with proper permissions on the device. cdwrite tries to run
with realtime priority, and I don't know just how tightly a realtime
process could lock the systems if it gets its knickers in a twist.
  You might also try software watchdog, I would expect it to reboot if
the kernel is up but the RT process is looping, such as waiting for a
status to change or some such.

  His first management concern is not solving the problem, but covering
his ass. If he lived in the middle ages he'd wear his codpiece backward.
