Not the fact that Linux is capable of stellar things, which I totally
agree with.

Oh, I don't doubt it -  But I'd be amused to see the measurements, 
if you have them to hand.

Absolutely.

They won't - the maintainers would never allow us to do that.

Who said that I was going to single-handedly change the world? What's
different with Linux is the development model. That's why *we* will 
succeed where others have failed before. There's some incredible intellect 
all  around Linux, but that's not all it takes, as you've pointed out.

I don't have them to hand, but if you think anyone's making money on
PCs nowadays, you're delusional (with respect to hardware). With respect
to Linux, what makes you think distros are going to make large amounts
of money from a freely replicatable OS, for tiny embedded systems?
Support for servers, on the other hand, is a different game ...
