	Absolutely!  devicefs should be for anything that is simplified
by using the drivers/base rendezvous to eliminate that type of list
management which is repeated so many times in the kernel.
	One thing that is very confusing about the current
drivers/base code is that "struct bus' really has nothing to do
with a bus.  It should be called "struct device_type."  For example,
sd_mod (scsi disk), sr_mod (scsi cdrom), and sg (scsi generic) are
all drivers for arbitrary scsi devices, regardless of whether
they are connected by scsi ribbon cable, usb, or whatever.
	In the example of system partitions and raid, you could put a
struct device in struct gendisk and have the partitioning module
register themselves as drivers of that device type.  That way, they
would automatically try to attach to each disk that had no
partitioning scheme attached (actually, I'd rather eliminate all
partitioning suppot from the kernel and just have the device
mapper make the partition devices under control of a user level
utility, similar to the way all of my systems have been running
for the past couple of years via partx).
