Well.  The filesystem could be corrupted, and there may not be a ".."
entry in the directory.  Or the filesystem code might  be broken in
some way.  Or just maying it doesn't support "..".
No other part of the linux kernel ever asks a filesystem to do a
lookup of "..".  All other accesses are caught by the VFS layer and
converted to dentry->d_parent.
So it would not be too surprising if some filesystems didn't handle
".." properly.
isofs, for example, doesn't support ".." at all.  I think the code
appears to try, but is simply wrong.

The code was put in because problems were reported with xfs.  How ever
it is correct to have this code anyway to protect nfsd from
corrupt, incomplete, or broken filesystems.
