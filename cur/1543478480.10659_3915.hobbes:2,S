Subject: deadlock in 2.2.0-pre7.

I had a deadlock in 2.2.0-pre7.
I was untarring a copy of the new distributed.net client program, and
tar never returned.  A ps showed tar to be in the uninterruptible
sleep (D) state.  Shortly after doing the PS, whatever command I typed
wouldn't return.  I was able to shift out of X into a console window
and use the magic sysrequest to get the PC where the processor was sitting. 
EIP 10:C0107059 EFLAGS: 0246 
EAX: 00000001 EBX: 00000000 ECX: C01FCD40 EDX: CO1FCD40
ESI: C0214000 EDI: 006820F8EBP: DS: 0018 ES: 0018
CR0: 80050036 CR2: 4000C000 CR3: 00101000
EIP is the instruction after the 'hlt' in cpu_idle.
If this happens again, is there anything I can do to get more
useful debugging information??
My config info follows...  To save space, I've processed it as some
folks have suggested doing for the /proc/config feature.
