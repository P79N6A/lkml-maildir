This is highly amusing, coming from someone who does not maintain a 
driver with a firmware.
The current firmware infrastructure is too primitive.  Compiling the 
firmware into the driver is much easier on the driver maintainers and 
users, presently.
Repeating myself,
* Most firmwares are a -collection- of images and data.  The firmware 
infrastructure should load an -archive- of firmwares and associated data 
values.
* The firmware distribution infrastructure is basically non-existent. 
There is no standard way to make sure that a firmware separated from the 
driver gets to all users.
* The firmware bundling infrastructure is basically non-existent. 
(Arjan talked about this)  There needs to be a a way to ensure that the 
needed firmwares are automatically added to initramfs/initrd.
* There is no chicken-and-egg problem as Arjan mentions.  Once the above 
technical problems are resolved, its trivial to apply a firmware loading 
patch.  I believe in hard transitions, not shipping tg3 with firmware 
-and- a firmware loading patch.
* Firmwares such as tg3 should be shipped with the kernel tarball.
In short, there are plenty of technical problems to resolve before this 
is even a reasonable request.  Currently, a user upgrading to a tg3 sans 
firmware will simply get tg3 sans firmware.
