There's also the question how to define feature-equivalent.
I want my computer to power off after "halt".
There's a significant difference between how much kernel code was 
required for this feature for my old computer and what is required for 
my new computer (in kernel 2.6.14):
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  12721    2124     104   14949    3a65 arch/i386/kernel/apm.o
 136789    5724    4788  147301   23f65 drivers/acpi/built-in.o
