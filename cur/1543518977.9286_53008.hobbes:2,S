I'd definitely prfer the vm to be running in user mode via callbacks. That
keeps the 8086 vm handling a lot cleaner, and also means it doesnt blow your
machine to bits every time you meet a bios bug. Having a single vm doing all
the jobs makes sense however, as it keeps the bios single threaded in its
happy virtual world
