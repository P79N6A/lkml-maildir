FYI OMAC spec:
  
http://crypt.cis.ibaraki.ac.jp/omac/omac.html
As you can see, there is a fixed output no matter how large the input it, the
output is always 128 bits.
So how will this fit into the cipher.c interface?
        case CRYPTO_TFM_MODE_CTR:
                ops->cit_encrypt = omac_compute;
                ops->cit_decrypt = nocrypt;
                ops->cit_encrypt_iv = nocrypt_iv;
                ops->cit_decrypt_iv = nocrypt_iv;
                break;
But now the user will have to call cit_encrypt(tfm, dst[0], src[i], nbytes);
Notice how dest will always have to be dst[0].  Unless we use the hash interface.
Thoughts?
static int omac_encrypt(struct crypto_tfm *tfm,
                       struct scatterlist *dst,
                       struct scatterlist *src,
                       unsigned int nbytes)
{
        return crypt(tfm, dst, src, nbytes,
                     tfm->__crt_alg->cra_cipher.cia_encrypt,
                     omac_process, 1, tfm->crt_cipher.cit_iv);
}
JLC - has CTR mode implemented and will post once he has OMAC done as well.
