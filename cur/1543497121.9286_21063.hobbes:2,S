There is a library to use these things, on ftp.kernel.org somewhere, try
/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs/kernel-2.2
Programs which make use of this new library are few and far between,
though :-(
I expect widespread use of capabilities to start once the filesystem
support is merged with 2.3 kernel. The filesystem support allows you to
tag binaries with the exact privilege they need, rather than the rather
coarse grained "suid root".
