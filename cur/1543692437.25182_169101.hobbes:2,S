Mr. Morton,
I am experiencing defunct event/0 kernel daemons under 2.6.0-test6-mm1
with synaptics_drv 0.11.7, Dmitry Torokhov's gpm-1.20 with synaptics
support, and XFree86 4.3.0-10. Moving the touchpad in either X or with
gpm causes defunct event/0 processes to be created. This didn't happen
with 2.6.0-test5-mm4, using either synaptics_drv 0.11.6 or 0.11.7, and
I'm pretty sure that it didn't happen with 2.6.0-test6, but I will check
that.
I see in your e-mail here: 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0309.3/0926.html
that you merged a synaptics update in the -mm1 patchset. Do you have a
link to this patch so that I can revert it and see if it still occurs?
TIA
Brad Chapman
