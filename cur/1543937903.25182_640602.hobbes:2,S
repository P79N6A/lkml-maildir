I believe that's correct.

Before this patchset, it was possible for more than one lockd
to be up at a time, and I suppose there could have been races that
would cause both to exit without ever calling nlm_shutdown_hosts.
With this patchset, we may be able to remove that. I suspect that it's
probably a noop now. That said, even after spending a fair bit of time
in this code, I'm not entirely comfortable with it. I suggest that we
take the incremental approach to lockd changes unless someone here is
sure :-).
