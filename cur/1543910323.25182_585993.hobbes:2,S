Maybe it can use wait_task_inactive, which IIUC is being changed to address
the same RT issue.  OTOH, notify_count exists only for this.  So maybe the
better way is to clean that whole mechanism up somehow.  The exit.c changes
in your patch seem to be making it more mysterious rather than less so.
I haven't really thought much about the better solution.
Thanks,
Roland
