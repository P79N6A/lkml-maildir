In my case, the filesystem was completely full, and we were doing an
"rm -rf /mntpt/*", followed by a series of mkdir to set up the test
directories.  We were failing on the mkdir approximately 2/3'rds of
the time.

Right, I had forgotten about Lustre.  :-) I was only worrying about
the nested transaction case of writing to the quota file.  So what we
can do is only do the do the log_wait_commit (and retry the
transaction) if current->journal_info is NULL --- i.e., only when the
current process does not have a currently active handle.  If not, we
return -ENOSPC, and let the top-level caller (Lustre in your case)
retry the entire operation.
I think that should be sufficient to keep Lustre happy.
