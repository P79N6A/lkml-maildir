Apologies again for the noise.  This should be going to a Mandrake list,
but this is short and sweet.  Adding Juan Q. to cc-list.
It's still broken in 2.4.22-6mdk.  You'll get something like this when
you do make xconfig:
./tkparse < ../arch/i386/config.in >> kconfig.tk
3rdparty/lufs/Config.in: 2: unknown command
This will fix it:
