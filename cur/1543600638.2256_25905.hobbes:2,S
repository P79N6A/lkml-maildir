Hello...
I encounter a likely similar problem at the moment with aic7xxx and
RAID5:
I run a RAID5-Array on three SCSI-Disks, all IBM, all LVD on the
AIC7xxx-Controller on the Mobo (ASUS-P2B-DS)...and from time to time
(usually about once per week) always the same partition of the RAID5
gets a readerror and falls out of the array:

Ok, i also thought: "Bad disk" and to verify this (i have still
guarantee on the drive) i formated it, let the AIC-BIOS do a "remap of
bad blocks" and ran "badblocks" about 5 times on it with the
"-w"-option...last but not least i copied over 160GB from and to the
drive over two days...nothing, not a single failure of the drive...today
i re-integrated the disk in my array, and got already the first
fall-off.
I now switched also to the old aic7xxx driver, only to get an idea where
to seek the problem...in the raid-code, in the driver or somewhere
else...
Solong..
Frank.

Microsoft isn't the answer.
Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.
