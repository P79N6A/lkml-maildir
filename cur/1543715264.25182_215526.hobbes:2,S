This was my thought as well.  Surely you don't want to deploy such a
drastic change to the TCP state engine after just so little
investigation.
In the confined environment of BGP peerings, the risks can be
controlled (RSTs are typically rate-limited on the receiving end
anyway, for example).  On the net as a whole, you have to be
compatible with all implementations ever written.  If some
implementation replied to the ACK cookie with another RST with an
suitable sequence number, there might be a few issues.
(BTW, TCP connections used for BGP typically have port numbers from a
very small set.  So there is no additional randomness from that which
offers any additional protection.)
