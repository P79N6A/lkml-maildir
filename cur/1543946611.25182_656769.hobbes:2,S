It seems that some module dependency was lost, 
dm-crypt with async crypto depends now on crypto_blkcipher module
for this configuration.
Herbert, any following change required for dm-crypt or it is only
crypto subsystem issue?
(With old kernel/dm-crypt it loads "blkcipher" not "crypto_blkcipher",
maybe some initramdisk change required too...)
