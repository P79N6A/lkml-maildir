I mostly apply the patches + any cleanups (most of the patches I get from
DRM CVS needs whitespace cleanups - damn X hackers) so I usually just
write the commit message by hand from the mail when I check the stuff in,
I don't know of any way when doing hand commits to easily change the
author without messing with environment variables...
Dave.
