Yes, the client has to make its own arrangements for protecting this 
type of thing.
The "per process CPU caps" code that I'm working on using task watchers 
has to address these issues and indications (so far) are that they're 
solvable.  I should be in a position to post that code early next week 
and, hopefully, that will give some insight into what can be achieved 
with this type of mechanism.  What I've done might not be the best way 
to solve the issues involved but it should provide a starting point for 
discussion :-)
