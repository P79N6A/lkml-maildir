That reminds me, I'm not really happy with this patch, it's a hack not a 
real solution, either we save the timestamp always or not at all, making 
it dependent on an environment variable is IMO ugly.
I have a patch which does some tighter checking during config loading, 
which can be used whether it's needed to write the config. Other front 
ends could use this as well (e.g. xconfig right now always ask to save
the config).
bye, Roman
