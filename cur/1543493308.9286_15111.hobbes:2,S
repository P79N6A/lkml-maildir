Same problem here with 2 different Pentium SMP 2.2.3 boxes w/ 3C509 NIC's
but it doesn't have to be PING, i don't think, just sustained high network traffic.
eventually I get this msg on the console:
wait_on_irq, CPU 0
   irq 2[0,2]
   bh  2[0,0]
<[c0109ca1]> <[c0109bde]>....
c0109ca1 <__global_cli+bd/14c>
c0109bde <synchronize_irq+e/14>
c0109ed1 <disable_irq+61/68>
c015ed4d <qdisc_restart+39/6c>
c015aa43 <dev_queue_xmit+3b/c8>
c0164719 <ip_output+85/b8>
c016521a <ip_build_xmit+29a/2cc>
alt-sysreq-p  c01d0094 <__udelay+0/54>
alt-sysreq-B or PWR cycle is the only way out! arrrggg
System details available on request, reproducible if
someone wants to try a patch.
Reverted to 2.2.3 uP kernel for now
