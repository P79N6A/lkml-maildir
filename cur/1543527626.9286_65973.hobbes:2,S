Is linux's ARP implementation RFC compliant?  I am still looking for the
ARP rfc........but the way I remember it, a machine shouldn't respond to
an ARP request unless the requesting ip and the requested ip are on the
same network:
I have a linux box as eth0 208.206.76.5, and eth0:1 207.138.69.69 
tcpdump arp (on the 208.206.76.5 machine, while I ping from 208.206.76.1)
21:51:24.208529 eth0 B arp who-has 207.138.69.69 tell 208.206.76.1
21:51:24.208562 eth0 > arp reply 207.138.69.69 (0:40:5:a3:59:25) is-at 0:40:5:a3:59:25 (0:50:54:7f:63:c0)
208.206.76.1 does not have any interfaces in 207.138.69.x.  it is a cisco
router with an ethernet address 208.206.76.1, and a route statment:
ip route 207.137.69.0 255.255.255.0 e0
is it right for it to respond?
