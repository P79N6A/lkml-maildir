Hello.
Thank you very much for your time, Paul.
Yes, you understood what I wanted to do.
TOMOYO Linux's approach:
(1) It uses userspace intervention to allow/reject
    connections and/or packets based on the application's domain.
    Since existent hooks can't be used for this purpose,
    I inserted a new hook post_recv_datagram() at skb_recv_datagram()
    and I modified socket_post_accept() to return error so that
    I can drop/disconnect based on the application's domain.
    I think skb_recv_datagram() is the only place that can remove
    a message picked up with MSG_PEEK flags from the receive queue.
    To remove a message picked up with MSG_PEEK flags, I noticed that
    I have to do skb_kill_datagram()-like operation so that
    "the head message that must not be delivered to the caller" won't prevent
    picking up of "the non-head message that should be delivered to the caller"
    when the caller repeats only recv(MSG_PEEK) requests.
    Since skb_recv_datagram() can be called from interrupt context,
    I have to use spin_lock_irqsave() instead for spin_lock_bh(), am I right?

+			skb_free_datagram(sk, skb);
+			goto no_packet;
+		}
+
 		if (skb)
 			return skb;
    By the way, why can't socket_post_accept() fail?
    Someone may wish to do memory allocation at socket_post_accept().
    socket_accept() is too early for memory allocation because
    there is no chance to free allocated memory
    when sock->ops->accept() failed.
    I think socket_post_accept() should be able to fail.
(2) It allows the administrator judge interactively
    using a userspace agent.
    Thus, the new hook has to be inserted at blockable location,
    Since skb_recv_datagram() can be called from interrupt context,
    I do nothing in post_recv_datagram() if called from interrupt context.
+static int tmy_post_recv_datagram(struct sock *sk,
+				  struct sk_buff *skb,
+				  unsigned int flags)
+{
+	int error = 0;
+	const unsigned int type = sk->sk_type;
+
+	/* skb_recv_datagram() didn't dequeue. */
+	if (!skb)
+		return 0;
+
+	/* skb_recv_datagram() can be called from interrupt context. */
+	if (in_interrupt())
+		return 0;
+	/* I don't check if called by kernel process. */
+	if (segment_eq(get_fs(), KERNEL_DS))
+		return 0;
+
+	if (type != SOCK_DGRAM && type != SOCK_RAW)
+		return 0;
...(sniped)...
+}
Regards.
