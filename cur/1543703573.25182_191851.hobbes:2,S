I tend to disagree.  Giving the driver control over the lock used by the
midlayer is just wrong.  If it has global state (which a good driver better
shouldn't) it's up to the driver to protect it.  That we still have a way
to override that lock is the big bug rather, and in fact only three drivers
are doing that, and they all override it with a lock that's per-HBA anyway.
