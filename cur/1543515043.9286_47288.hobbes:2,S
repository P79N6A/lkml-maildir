Actually, I was thinking the major issue was correctly handling alignment
constraints on PCI-PCI Bridges (PPB) that may exist behind the hot-swap. You
have to have the PPB addresses aligned on a 1MByte boundardary, and they can
nest. You make a PPB hot-swappable, all of the sudden you have a bunch of
cards which come in all at the same time behind the bridge and have to be
allocated out of unused, contiguous space with a minimal address granularity
of 1MBytes.
Is there anything preventing a PCI expansion unit from being hot-swappable?
I haven't had a chance to read the hot-swap PCI specification, so I don't
know off the top of my head. It should be possible.
