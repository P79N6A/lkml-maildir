yeah, so far only volanomark seems to be affected by this, and if it 
indeed calls Thread.yield artificially it's a pretty stupid benchmark 
and it's not the fault of the JDK. If we had the source to volanomark we 
could fix this easily.

which JVM was utilized by the specjbb (Java Business Benchmark) tests?
