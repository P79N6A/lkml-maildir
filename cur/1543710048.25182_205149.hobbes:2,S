Hi,
While writing code, the assignment operator (=) is many-a-times confused with the comparison operator (==) resulting in very subtle bugs difficult to track. To keep a check on this -- the constant can be written on the LHS rather than the RHS which will result in a compile time error if wrong operator is used.
Is this an encouraged practice while writing any code for the kernel ? Or is this choice left to the developer ? I was unable to find any reference to it in the CodingStyle document. I did find some code under drivers/ which used (NULL == foo) and similar constructs. 
Can this be added to the CodingStyle document ?
Cheers,
Amarendra
