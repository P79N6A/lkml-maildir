Depending on the use, dedicated disk may not be better, unless the 
budget is large. I ran an application which had a heavily read database 
and a large collection of files thich were read based on offsets read 
from the database. I have a limited number of drives available 
(rackspace limit, not $). I partitioned the drives with a small 
partition for the heavily read database, using three copies raid1, and 
raid5 for the more lightly used data, across the same disks.
I tried almost every layout possible with six drives, and spreading the 
required head motion to all drives was a big win on the heavily read 
database, while spreading the storage over all drives was required 
because of capacity. And split and shared the performance was optimized. 
And it did stay up with a drive fail, although "up" means "didn't lose 
data" rather than "usefully fast."
