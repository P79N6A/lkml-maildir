and as luck has it, such a patch from Alexander van Heukelum has been 
put into x86.git#testing just yesterday.
So ... could you try x86.git#testing - does it work out of box? Is the 
reservation early enough to prevent pagetables be allocated in weird 
places? [or am i missing something - this is about the guest kernel 
reserving th 640k..1M area, not the host kernel - right?]
