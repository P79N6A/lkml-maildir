you are right, the validator indeed treated all these protocols as one, 
so this is a false positive. (there are two slock buckets already, 
because there is some natural lock nesting between listen sockets and 
ordinary sockets, but otherwise you are right that all net protocols 
were indeed treated as one category.)

the slock -> queue_lock dependency was first observed at:
-> (&sk->sk_lock.slock/1){-+}
    -> &dev->queue_lock          [<c0b98137>] dev_queue_xmit+0xc3/0x21e
so it comes from dev_queue_xmit(). No further information about where 
that was done - but i suspect it was TCP's sendmsg. af_packet.c never 
seems to be doing that.
The queue_lock -> xmit_lock dependency was first observed at:
-> (&dev->queue_lock){-+}
    -> &dev->xmit_lock           [<c0bb0827>] dev_activate+0xc8/0xe5
i think i'll solve this by splitting af_packet.c's slock into a separate 
bucket (separate lock type). (Such exceptions and locking assymetries 
can be expressed towards the validator in a pretty straightforward way, 
by initializing those locks in a special way.)
