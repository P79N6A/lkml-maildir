I used to think I knew how to handle this, but in your scheme where
the kernel is doing accounting for pinned memory by marking vmas with
VM_KERNEL_LOCKED, at step c), I don't see why the kernel won't unlock
vmas covering 0x0000 through 0x1fff and credit 8K back to the
process's pinning count.
Sorry to be so dense but can you spell out what you think should
happen at steps a), b) and c) above?

Yes, I agree.  If an app wants to register half a page and pass the
other half to a child process, I think the only answer is "don't do
that then."
