Better, and do you have time for two (possibly stupid) questions? In
each of the last cases it looks like the transformation is from a
write_lpcontrol -> reverse_port and a write_lpcontrol (old address -
0x20). Except the first one, which merely has the reverse_port. One
would think that there should be a write_lpcontrol(q, 0x0); after that
one.
Also, is the reverse port sticky, or does it only apply to the next
write? If it's only the next, then maybe a different name would be
better. If it's sticky, then I think the code is wrong...
