Cool.

Ok, this bit is named 'LinkChg' in drivers/net/8139cp.c as well.

Just to clarify, it is still done in rtl8169_open() instead of rtl8169_init_one().
Even if it is a change of behavior in a supposedly stable serie, I guess it is ok
as it moves the driver in the direction of the 8139cp driver.

So you can not reliably remove the phy timer and simply use the LinkChg status
change, right ?
Is everybody fine if I cook up a serie of patches for -netdev/-mm inclusion
which includes:
- your link related changes
- start of a 8139cp.c genetic mutation on top of those
- reworked Jon D Mason's NAPI changes
ETA: this week end, start of incoming week.
