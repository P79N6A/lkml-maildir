This document was written before Andreas posted his patch - I just never
came around updating it.

No - and I still do not see it. Please explain how we can be backward
compatible when vendors start utilising separate directories for src and output.
Anyway, after I gave it some extra thoughs I concluded that
/lib/modules/kernel-<version>/ was the wrong place to keep
info about where to src for a given build is located.
This information has to stay in the output directory.
So what I will implement is that during the kernel build process
(not the install part) a symlink named 'source' is placed
in the root of the output directory - and links to the root of
the kernel src used for building the kernel.
Then /lib/modules/kernel-<version>/build/source will be where
the source is located.
And /lib/modules/kernel-<version>/build will point to the output files.
If the vendor does not utilise separate src and output directories
they will point to the same directory.
If the vendor utilises separate output and source directories
then thay will point in two different places.
Comments?
