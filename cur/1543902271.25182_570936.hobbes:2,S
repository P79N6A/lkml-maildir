Or, thanks for rescuing this post.
I think this is an important question.  If we merge the local SA
stuff, then are we creating a problem for dealing with QoS?  Are we
going to have to revert the local SA stuff once the QoS stuff is
available?  Or is there at least a sketch of a plan on how to handle
this?
