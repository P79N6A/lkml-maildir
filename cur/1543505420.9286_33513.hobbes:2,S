Subject: [patch] for compiling md.c (RAID) on 2.3.13
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

md.c from 2.3.13 didn't compile.  2.3.13 removes the WRITEA constant
from linux/fs.h and all places it was used, except from md.c
which test for this now undefined value.
This one-line patch removes the WRITEA test from md.c  It seems
to work fine on my machine, and I believe it is correct as WRITEA
was removed everywhere else by the 2.3.13 patch.
