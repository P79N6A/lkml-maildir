Hi, folks
I wrote a pcmcia driver. The problem is that CS gives the driver for
example IRQ3 which is later reserved if I open ttyS1. In this situation
my driver can not be opened even if IRQ4 for example was free. Thats a
bit annoying but more fatal is that if remove the card in that time the
kernel oopses (pcmcia system crashes but fortunately not the whole
machine). The question is can I do something better. If someone was kind
enough to help me and believes (s)he knows the solution, I would be clad
to send the source.
