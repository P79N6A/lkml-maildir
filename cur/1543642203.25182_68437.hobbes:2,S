Nothing whatsoever.  If I wrote the code I would have used "!=".  But
when editing code written by someone else I try to adopt that person's
style, for better or for worse.  Using !(a == b) is more obtuse but it
is still unambiguous and readable.  So I didn't feel it was that big of
a deal to leave it in that form.  Besides, there are many MANY other
places in that driver far worse than this - just try to follow the code
that sets up DMA operations or look at the mostly dead code which tries
to identify if it is a cause for an asserted interrupt.  If we want to
start nitpicking issues as small as this then I invite you to inspect
the rest of pdc202xx.c.  Have the antacids ready...
But in the future, if I post more fixes to the IDE driver (probably 
won't), I'll sanitize as I go along.
I find it amusing that a post from me which describes evidence of
completely broken Promise controller DMA goes unresponded to, yet there
are concerns about whether to spell code as "a != b" or "!(a == b)".
