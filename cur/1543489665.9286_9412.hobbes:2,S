Because if you want anyone to be able to play games, you give them 3dfx
access - ideally you'd want a group 3dfx[1].  If there's a way to crash the
system with 3dfx, then you're not providing 3dfx properly, and you're just
inviting people to introduce a security hazard.
The same is definitely not true of /dev/mem - access to that is definitely
restricted, and everybody knows that [or should].
David.
[1] or group d3fx, due to issues with quotas and users/groups starting with
    numbers....
