No.
Both 4k stacks and unit-at-a-time are changes with negative impact on 
the stack usage, and I want to have problems sorted out separately.
We wouldn't have much discussion here if 4k stacks were only judged by 
technical facts, but although the last known problem was fixed in -mm 
nearly two months ago, it seems the ndiswrapper groupies have managed to 
spread enough FUD to even persuade Andrew that 4k stacks were evil.  :-(

That's nice.
Could you try to get at least the part that checks whether more than 
STACK_WARN stack is left (if CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW is set) into
-mm (and perhaps later into Linus' tree)?
