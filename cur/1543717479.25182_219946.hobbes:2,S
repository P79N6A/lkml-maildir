Subject: [PATCH 2.6] i2o_proc converting from proc_read to seq_file with problems and request for help
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
first, i didn't attach the patch because the size is 120k and it doesn't 
work at the moment. If you want it by e-mail, please let me know. 
Meanwhile you could download the patch from:
http://i2o.shadowconnect.com/testing/i2o_proc-seq_file.patch
The patch converts the proc_read function to the seq_file function 
(thanks to Al Viro for helping).
Only some functions are working without any problem (e. g. i2o_*_lct). 
But some others get a Segmentation fault (e. g. i2o_*_claimed). Strange 
about it is that the Segmentation fault occur after the function returns 
and the output is displayed normally.
If you want the output of the kernel for 32-bit UP and 64-bit SMP 
system, look at 
http://i2o.shadowconnect.com/testing/.
Any help what i done wrong would be appreciated.
Thank you very much.
Markus Lidel
