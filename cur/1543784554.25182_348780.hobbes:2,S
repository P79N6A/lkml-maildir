According to his mail (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/8/208
):
"As per the new merge policies that were discussed during LKS in Ottawa 
earlier during the summer, I'm going to accept new stuff for 2.6.14 only 
during the first two weeks after 2.6.13 was released.
That release was ten days ago, so you've got four more days before I don't 
want any big merges."
Thanks,
Nish
