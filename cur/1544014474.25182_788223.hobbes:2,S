It was nonsense because the summary didn't contain all of the
information required to provide context and you copied the Working Group
in the middle of all this.
NTP can provide leap-second information via an autokey protocol request,
 see Section 10.6 Leapseconds Values Message (LEAP)
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ntp-autokey-04.txt
 but
that means you need to have autokey set up with another NTP server and
that means adding infrastructure that you probably don't want and are
not prepared to handle.

This is a *lot* more complicated than you might think. If you are
thinking of implementing this similarly to the way timezone information
is added for display purposes, you need the whole list of leap seconds
and when the change happened since you now have to look at a timestamp
and see when it was and then apply all of the leapseconds up to that
point in time and none of the leapseconds beyond that. In addition, you
have legacy files that have UTC timestamps on them so you would need to
distinguish between UTC (legacy) and TAI timestamps in the file system
among other places (anywhere where a timestamp exists) and what would
you do about database tables which contain timestamps? The list goes on.
I'd much rather you spend the time tackling the clock interrupt losses
that many of our Linux users complain about. See:
https://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/KnownOsIssues#Section_9.2.4.
for some of the gorier details. I'm sure you don't really want us
recommending that they set HZ=100 in the kernel to alleviate the problem.
