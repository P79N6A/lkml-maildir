To avoid the requirement of all submissions going through a single person,
we have a system of formal authorizations. Specific people are authorized
to release certain classes of work. Would the community object to a slight
modifications to the Signed-off-by lines from TimeSys? E.g.
Signed-off-by: La Monte H.P. Yarroll <piggy@timesys.com> under TS00062
This completes the traceability path all the way back to the VP who signed
off on TS00062.

I THINK I have a case not covered here. I sometimes need to post unpublished
work done by other people at my company. Since the work is not yet 
published,
the GPL doesn't really grant me any special rights. The authorization I use
to publish is in fact NOT an open source license. I think clause (b) could
probably be weakened to cover my case.

I'd like to include a link between the external path and our internal 
procedures.
