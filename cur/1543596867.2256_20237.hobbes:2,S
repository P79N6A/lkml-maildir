Subject: Compressed loop for 2.4?

Hi all!
After some time browsing the net I cannot find any still existing
references to a latest version of the compressed loopback device driver
that Rusty Russel once did. And since most of Rusty's addresses do not
seem valid anymore I would like to ask here if someone knows something
about the actual status of compressed loopback drivers for 2.4 kernels
(or at least a pointer to older versions).
Or is someone else working on something like this?
The background is that we need a compressed rw filesystem for 2.4
kernels. Jffs2 would be nice but we currently use IDE-flash disks for
this project and cannot change :(
Any hints and/or pointers are welcome!
Thanks in advance
CU
