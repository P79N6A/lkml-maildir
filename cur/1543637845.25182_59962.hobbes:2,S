JFS had two incorrect calls to d_delete in jfs_rmdir and jfs_unlink.  They
were needed in the 2.2 kernel, and somehow they didn't do any apparent
harm until now.
Here is that patch I sent to Linus:
# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:
# Project Name: Linux kernel tree
# This patch format is intended for GNU patch command version 2.5 or higher.
# This patch includes the following deltas:
#	           ChangeSet	1.511   -> 1.512  
#	      fs/jfs/namei.c	1.13    -> 1.14   
#
# The following is the BitKeeper ChangeSet Log
# --------------------------------------------
# 02/07/29	shaggy@kleikamp.austin.ibm.com	1.512
# Remove d_delete call from jfs_rmdir and jfs_unlink
# 
# jfs_rmdir and jfs_unlink have always called d_delete, but it hasn't
# caused a problem until 2.5.28.  The call is an artifact of the 2.2
# kernel, which had gone unnoticed in 2.4 and 2.5.
