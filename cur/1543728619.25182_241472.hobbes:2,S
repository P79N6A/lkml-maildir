As has been pointed out by others, the alternative is a wasted disk.
Even if the quality is degraded slightly where burnfree kicks in, the
disk may still be suitable for its intended use.  CDs are often used
for moving some data to another machine and discarded after a single
use.  In these cases, a lower resistance to scratches is not a
problem.  For long-term storage the situation could of course be
different.
