I don't have an SBT2 to test, but it's likely that they share
this problem.  The only difference in them is supposed to be
SBT2 using bigger/faster processors.

Yes, I tested that one as well and it works for me, using
"mpint=5,0,4,9".
But now I need to upgrade the BIOS and I can't run phlash.exe!!!

dump_pirq in UP mode, PNP OS = Yes or No, gives the same
output as above.  I'd still like to get dump_pirq
working if you have something else that I could try.

USB Interrupt: 9
-----------------------------------------------
Yes, the BIOS assigns interrupt 9 to USB.  9 is the correct
value as far as the BIOS is concerned.
BTW, where is the <irq_routing_table> structure defined, in what
spec?
