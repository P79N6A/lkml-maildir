I am running 2.6.0-test2-mm1, and upon boot have received a gift of many
"Buffer I/O error on device hde3" messages in my log. After they quit,
they never seem to come back.
I'd just like to know what might cause this? I see fs/buffer.c is
telling me this, but I don't know what is failing.
One thing of note, I just upgraded my CPU from an Athlon XP 1800+ to a
2400+, and had to disable IO-APIC, and shut APIC off in my BIOS.
