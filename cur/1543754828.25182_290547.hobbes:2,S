Subject: Logitech Cordeless Desktop Keyboard fails to report class descriptor

The receiver of my Logitech Cordeless Desktop fails to report the 
keyboard's class  descriptor most times I insert the usb-hid module 
since I changed to linux 2.6. The modell of the receiver is C-BD9-DUAL 
REV C.
The request seems not to fail but the count of received characters is zero.
As I said it only fails most times, I worked around making the following 
changes in drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c from linux-2.6.11-rc2:
Following the good example of drivers/usb/core/message.c line 575, I 
initialized the buffer in hid_get_class_descriptor() to zero.
In the loop of hid_get_class_descriptor() not waiting for any result but 
waiting for a result wich is lower the requested size of the class 
descriptor (line 1290).
usb_hid_configure() should not try to parse the expected length but the 
received (line 1653).
attached is a patch to linux-2.6.11-rc2 with these changes
