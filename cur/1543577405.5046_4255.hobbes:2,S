Linux 2.4 is now out, it is also what people should be concentrating on first
when issuing production drivers and driver updates. Effective from this point
2.2 driver submissions or major driver updates will only be accepted if the
same code is also available for 2.4.
Someone has to do the merging otherwise, and it isnt going to be me...
