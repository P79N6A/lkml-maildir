In 2.3.25 with the latest (as of yesterday) pre-release version of the
pcmcia-cs-3.1.4 package, there needs to be an
"EXPORT_SYMBOL(parport_pc_ops);" somewhere to avoid an undefined symbol
error for the parport_cs.o module.  The quick and dirty fix is to add
the EXPORT_SYMBOL() to linux/drivers/parport/parport_pc.c after the
structure declaration, but I suspect that isn't the preferred place.
