Hi Roman!
	Firstly, I give up: what kernel is this patch against?  It's
hard to read a patch this big which doesn't apply to any kernel I can find 8(

Interesting approach.  Splitting init and start and stop and exit is
normal, but encapsulating the usecount is different.  I made start
and exit return void, though.
Hmmm... you sidestepped the "rmmod -f" problem, by running module->start()
again if module->exit() fails.  I decided against this because module
authors have to make sure this works.
I chose the more standard "INIT(init, start)" & "EXIT(stop, exit)" which
makes it easier to drop the exit part if it's built-in.
My favorite part is including the builtin-modules.  I assume this means
that "request_module("foo")" returns success if CONFIG_DRIVER_FOO=y now?
Sorry I've been slack in posting my patch: will do tonight I promise 8)
Cheers!
Rusty.
