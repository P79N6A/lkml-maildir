To tell the truth, I prefer making new interface to allocate new added
memory than using normal kzalloc().
Because this kzalloc() will allocate() other node's memory
by im-completion new memory's initialization.
In addition, memory hot-add may be required at the time that memory
is already exhausted.
This kzalloc() might be "finish blow". (pgdat is not small.
Especially, ia64 needs node data's copy.)
Probably, user will feel very strange. 
"I added new memory. But OOM killer is called by it, why????"
So I think alloc_hot_added_memory() is desirable, which can allocate new
added memory until completion of initialization.
Thanks for your advice.
