What do you all think about this:
#include <stdio.h>
#define CACHE_LINE_SIZE 128
#define ____cacheline_aligned __attribute__((__aligned__(CACHE_LINE_SIZE)))
#define __cacheline_start   struct { } ____cacheline_aligned;
#define offsetof(t, m)  ((int)(&((t *)0)->m))
struct S {
    __cacheline_start
    int x;
    __cacheline_start
    int y;
    int z;
};
int main()
{
    struct S s;
    printf("%d\n",sizeof(struct S));
    printf("%d\n",offsetof(struct S,x));
    printf("%d\n",offsetof(struct S,y));
    printf("%d\n",offsetof(struct S,z));
}

So you don't have to modify any field, just put __cacheline_start where
needed ? (and does not add any extra sizeof(int) overhead).
