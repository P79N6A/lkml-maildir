BIOs for reads are allocated with GFP_KERNEL - both mpage_readpages
and mpage_readpage.
They used to be allocated GFP_NOIO.  This is a subtle but significant
improvement which came in when we stopped using submit_bh for bulk reads.
It means that the only time we threaten the memory reserves is when
allocating BIOs for writes.  And those BIOs free more memory than they
consume.  This, plus the PF_MEMALLOC reserves which the radix-tree
allocator leaves behind makes us pretty robust.
A poorly-written gigE driver could zoom in and steal the remaining
few megabytes from interrupt context.  But even then, the BIO mempools
would have to be exhausted at the time.  And I don't see a way in which
they can be exhausted without us having write BIOs in flight.
No, I can't prove it.  But I can't think of a contrary scenario
either.

OK, the caps helped ;)
