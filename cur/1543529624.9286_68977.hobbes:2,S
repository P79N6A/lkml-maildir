	Do you have a char device called /dev/ppp? It must be created
	with major 108, minor 0. Also, do you have
	alias char-major-108 ppp_generic
	alias tty-ldisc-3 ppp_async
	in your modules.conf?
	If you don't want to include these lines in your modules.conf
	right now, just
	# modprobe -k ppp_generic
	# modprobe -k ppp_async
	And you can verify if it will work for you.
	[]s, Roger...
