Exactly! Here is the scenario: The FSF releases a GPL v.3 which allows
proprietary forking. Someone at IBM downloads any version of the kernel and
whatever other GPLed software they please, and use the "at your option"
clause to accept the licencing of the software under v. 3 of the GPL. At
that point, since they have the legal right to do so under v. 3, they do
their proprietary fork of all that code, and bingo! proprietary linux! Of
course, in that scenario they can't stop people from working on the
nonproprietary versions, but they would certainly be legally able to
distribute binary-only releases and not share the source of their
modifications or even the original code. It would be a completely legal,
closed-source version of the entire linux/gnu/etc OS, with no argument at
all.
This could happen any time the FSF decides to release a new version of the
GPL. And they are not responsible to anyone for the content of the licence.
They can make it say whatever they want it to say. The same goes for whoever
might gain control of the FSF.
My example of RMS getting mad and making the change was meant more as a
joke. I don't think he would ever do such a thing. The point I was getting
at was the inherent fragility of the GPL because of that clause. A takeover
of the FSF through some unpredictable means, would allow the legal creation
of a new GPL which would apply to all work previously licenced under any
version of the GPL.
The argument that L.T. would simply change licences is obviously not a good
one as we've seen from the KDE/QT situation. KDE cannot change its licence
because of the tremendous diversity of contributed code, and the same is
true of linux.
So on the one hand the licence can be changed out from under us, and on the
other hand we cannot change the licencing out from under the GPL.
Shake in your boots.
