Ingo, before I read this I was thinking about it a little and yes, this
was one of the issues which worried me.  However, is there any reason
why we can't just use the last known goodness of the process currently
running on each CPU, rather than recalculating the current goodness?
Goodness can only decrease over time as the quantum expires, so the only
danger would be that we miss a reschedule event, not that we reschedule
too often.  That's certainly better than never getting a reschedule
right at all.  Given that the default scheduler keeps the goodness of
interactive processes higher at all times than the goodness of any
CPU-bound processes, this behaviour would probably work pretty well
without requiring a per-CPU goodness recalculate for every wakeup.
