    I'd be tempted to just leave the modules they way they work now,
    because in most cases module loading lets you shoot yourself in the
    foot (except, for no apparent reason, ethernet modules, where a lot
    of 'em won't autoprobe because The Computer Knows What's Best.
    Sigh.) today, and someone may actually want to take advantage of
    one module stepping all over anothers address space.
