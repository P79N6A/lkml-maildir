I've never tried it, but Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
suggests using mem= along with memmap= to specify an exact memmap.
	memmap=nn[KMG]@ss[KMG]
			[KNL] Force usage of a specific region of memory
			Region of memory to be used, from ss to ss+nn.
Is this on a sparc system or are you just building sparc tools?
I don't know if memmap= works on sparc arch.
