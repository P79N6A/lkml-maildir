I do not believe it is possible to compute the nth hash in O(1) time,
starting with no previously-computer hashes, since in order to
computer the nth hash, you need input which is the n-1th hash. This
takes the form: hash(n) = hash(hash(n-1)). In order to know the hash 
of n-1, you need to know the hash of n-2. This chains down to your
original hash. This argument holds if you retaining the standard
properties of hashes: that is it is non-trivial to find input which
yields a given hash.
