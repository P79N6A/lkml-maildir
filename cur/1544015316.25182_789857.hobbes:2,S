Could the "fff" mean the window was incorrectly disabled by BIOS?
One of the public IBM PCI-X bridge docs says:
    Address bits 11:0 are assumed to be x`FFF' for the limit address.
Looks like 0 was written to both Base and Limit Registers for all
three resources. IIRC, BIOS is supposed to write ~0 to the limit
register in order to disable resource routing.
