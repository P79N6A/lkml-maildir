So far I've only tried VGA cards, like radeons and r128s.

Yeah, that would work for me.

Sure, each bus can have that address range reserved.  The ia64 specific 
HAVE_PCI_LEGACY code (in arch/ia64/sn/pci/pci_dma.c I think) might illuminate 
things a bit.  Basically, each bus has legacy base addresses, we could 
reserve 64k for port space and 1M for memory.
