In checking a "make allmodconfig" I noticed that the apm device 
(arch/i386/kernel/apm.c) is still using the old pm_send_all setup - I know 
the fix is to add suspend/resume hooks but the apm code hasn't been touched 
since 2002 and isn't using the new device API (it doesn't even register, 
AFAICT, a platform_device struct) Beyond needing to add that, are there any 
suggestions ?
