If the caller is calling smp_call_function_on_cpu directly (in 
contrast to calling it via smp_call_function) they probably 
are targetting a specific group of processors so they have also probably 
done a check of some sort for cpus online, or are explicitely targeting 1 
cpu.

This could be achieved if s390 (or if we had a generic one, this is 
another story...) had a for_each_cpu type iterator, which would also 
cover aforementioned mask &= cpu_online_map issue, but as an aside, it is 
harder to track down lockups from things like IPIs to invalid cpus than a busy loop 
waiting for num_cpus.

Thanks i wasn't aware of that, i'll add that.
