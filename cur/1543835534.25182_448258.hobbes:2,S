I think you will find he's pointing out that he's running udev 079 and the kernel 
Documentation/Changes file states :-
o  udev                   071                     # udevinfo -V
brad@bklaptop2:~$ zcat /usr/share/doc/udev/changelog.gz | head -n1
Summary of changes from v078 to v079
Same distribution :)
