port 111 is the rpc portmap.  My guess is you aren't running portmap and
your /etc/nsswitch.conf has "nis" and "nisplus" references in it.  (Damn you
redhat and glibc.)

This was hashed about long ago.  I think it's documented somewhere.  I
usually remove all the damned NIS/NIS+ BS from the system configuration
(including the libraries) after installing the system. (I have _one_ machine
with NIS capabilities as it was once integrated into the office network.)
