in that case ARCH_PFN_OFFSET is 0 which is the old behaviour, nothing
change...

but in that case do they use ARCH_PFN_OFFSET != 0 ? if so that would be
very surprising. That would meand "I have a hole a the start of my mem,
I don't know at compile time where it starts, but I state that my physical
mem start at ARCH_PFN_OFFSET anyways"

Again in these cases, I doubt that they will setup ARCH_PFN_OFFSET...
