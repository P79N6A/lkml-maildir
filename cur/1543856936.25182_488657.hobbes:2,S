I haven't yet.  But I don't think I have actually tried turning
the cable around in a very meaningful way yet either.  Possibly
this is something that has been fixed.  I know there are some
odd issues that I have encountered.  Like occasionally I would
need to stop the software on one side, or I would need to unplug
it when things got sufficiently confused.

So I took a quick look what it would take to do this truly generically
and even initializing this generally when console code typically
is registered looks like a problem.  Although only because we don't
get around to setting up pci_config space access helpers in a timely
manner.  To some extent that still sucks because you are still being
initialized before the general ehci-hcd code.
Regardless an arch specific i386 variant was easy to throw together.
It still needs a bit of work but it basically worked.

Yep that sounds like the right thing to do.  I think I at least
need to be called from something outside of drivers/usb and may
need the code there.
Doing this in a truly generic fashion looks like a major pain.
Because all of the infrastructure needs to be fixed.
