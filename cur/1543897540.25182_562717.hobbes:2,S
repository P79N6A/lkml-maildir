Gah, this particular topic and a few other similar header- 
compatibility ones show up once a month on LKML; I should probably  
just make a patch to fix all the types.h files and be done with it.   
The proper solution is this:
# if __STDC_VERSION__ >= 19901L
typedef   signed long long __s64;
typedef unsigned long long __u64;
# elif defined(__GNUC__)
__extension__ typedef   signed long long __s64;
__extension__ typedef unsigned long long __u64;
# else
#  error "Your compiler doesn't support long long (IOW: It sucks).   
Please get a new one"
# endif
That way if you have any kind of vaguely-long-long-compatible  
compiler then it will work, and otherwise you'll get a nice useful  
error message.  It also makes sure that GCC doesn't spew warnings/ 
errors when in c89-pedantic mode.  The "__extension__" keyword is  
designed for use in implementation header files which want to use GCC- 
isms unconditionally.
Cheers,
