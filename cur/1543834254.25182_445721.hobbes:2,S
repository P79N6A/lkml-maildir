Life gets easier when you accept the fact that there are different 
conventions within the kernel, driven by maintainer preference. Which is 
why it is impossible to document a definite set of conventions too. 
CodingStyle really is just a good approximation what kernel code should 
look like. If you deviate from it too much, everyone agrees that 
you're violating it, but there definitely is room for maintainer 
preference. As a contributor, when you accept that, you'll have much 
greater chances of getting your patches merged.
