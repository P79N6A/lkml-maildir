Hi all...
I got time to track my ps2 problems. I run 2.6.9-rc2-mm[123] (that was
enough).
Results:
- mm1: mouse and kbd work ok, both in console and X
- mm2: mouse works, no kbd. I had to unplug/plug the keyboard to get it
  responding.
- mm3: kbd ok, but ps2 mouse is sluggish.
In latest -rc3-mm2, behavior is like mm3 and above.
If you need more info, I have dmesg's, or still can boot on those kernels.
Perhaps this gives some clue. I will scan the changelog for -mm3.
TIA
