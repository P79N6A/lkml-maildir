Although this is in the faqs for a long time, (behavior is undefined if
fbdev is used with software that touches the video card) this is an
issue that needs to be taken into consideration.  Without the set_var()
hook, fbcon will depend on the contents of info->var if there is a need
to touch the hardware or not.  And switching from X to the console will
not change the var, but since X actually did touch the hardware, you
just messed up your screen or worse, crashed the hardware.
Before, most drivers just unconditionally refresh the hardware at every
switch  during set_var(). I've been pointing this out for a long time
now, do we unconditionally do a check_var()/set_par() after every
console switch, or do we rely on fbdev and X cooperating with each
other? Or better, maybe fbcon has a way of knowing if the switch came
from  Xfree86.
