Hi Alexander, Horst, and also everybody else who responded.
First, can I state that the response has easily proven that this idea
is in demand - 170 emails on the subject all interested in it just
can't mean anything else. It's also far too many for me to reply to
individually, hence my choosing these two to respond to on behalf of
them all, with snippets from one or two others included...

Many people have made the same mistake, so can I clarify the above. If
you read through it, you will note that I said...
 >> Basically, I see it initially working such that for a transparent
...and when I said "initially working", I meant that the initial
implementation would have this requirement so that people (myself
included) could at least get something working to try out, and that
the ability to create, modify or delete files would come later.

Again, this is something that would come later, once the initial
implementation was working.

Agreed, but then, it is also for the initial implementation, so some
limitations should be expected. That is the first limitation I would
expect to lift, but an implementation that had that limitation would
still be quite useful.

That is precicely why the above limitations on the INITIAL
implementation were suggested - they imply that these problems can be
left until later when an initial implementation is in place and can be
tried out.

I have to admit that I hadn't come across that, but on reading it,
I'll definately agree with that...

I'll certainly watch out for that.

Go ahead. I'm not in a position to do it myself at the moment, as I've
far too much reading up to do before I'm ready to start. You will note
that I said as much in my initial post.

I'm not so certain that this behaviour is as well defined as is
claimed, and certainly I can see limitations with the behaviour as
described. See later...

What if the "upper FS layer" changes?

I have had a look, and I can see limitations with their method,
several of which I would be unhappy with.

Not for an INITIAL implementation. As far as I can see, EVERY file
system implemented in Linux has first been implemented as a R/O file
system, and only later has R/W ability been added.

When you say "the Daemon book", which specific book are you referring
to?
*** Limitations
According to the documentation I've found or been pointed to regarding
the union file system, it includes the following limitations for it to
remain reliable:
 1. All partitions involved must be mounted at the same time.
    Why? What is wrong with the idea of adding new partitions
    to an existing set? Certainly, for the purpose that I'm
    interested in it, this requirement is a killer.
 2. All partitions involved must be mounted in the same order
    each time.
    Again, why? OK, I can see that it's an easy way of dealing
    with which partition to put changes on, but it's also an
    extremely limiting one.
 3. Although not explicitly stated, the examples shown all
    imply that all partitions involved must be of the same
    type.
    I would certainly hope this is NOT the case.
Personally, I would be happier to see the following mounting semantics
used for dealing with this:
 1. mount -o ro           /dev/cdrom /mnt
    Mounts an initial partition read-only as a basis for later
    additions, or as a stand-alone mount.
 2. mount -o ro,trans     /dev/cdrw  /mnt
    Mounts a second or later partition transparently on top of
    the existing ones, also mounted read-only.
 3. mount -o rw,trans     /dev/hda7  /mnt
    Mounts a second or later partition transparently on top of
    the existing ones, mounted read-write and labelled as the
    one to be used for noting any changes.
The following restrictions could then be reasonably implemented:
 1. The bottom partition MUST be read-only. Given these semantics,
    this is not a problem.
 2. In any stack of transparent mounts, AT MOST ONE may be
    marked read-write. Any attempt to mount a second one as
    read-write MUST fail. However, there is no problem with
    a stack having no read-write partitions in it.
Note that whilst I've used "trans" as the option to specify this
behaviour, I'm not fussed as to its spelling - "wibble" would serve
just as well.
Best wishes from Riley.
