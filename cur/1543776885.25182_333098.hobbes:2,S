That's so sadly right ;-)

I don't believe the hardware is broken, as it's been running for more than 2 
years 100% stable with a 24/7/365 uptime. And with me plugging and unplugging 
USB devices...
Never had a single problem of the kind with any 2.4.x kernel. Get those 
problems only with 2.6.x kernels, and, in 2.6.12, only when UP IO-APIC is 
enabled (which ran perfectly good in 2.4).
So the problem is circled to 2.6 kernel, uhci_hcd and UP IO-APIC.

I can hardly remove my VIA chipset from the mobo, and the USB thing is in the 
VIA thing ;-))
And I'm afraid I won't have the time to play that much with hardware, besides 
the fact that this is supposed to be a server which usually has uptimes over 
90 days rather than reboot-for-testing-the-damn-kernel-once-again ;-))
But I'm pretty sure this is no hardware problem, unless 2.6 considers "bad 
hardware" what 2.4 used to consider "nice hardware"...
Cheers.
