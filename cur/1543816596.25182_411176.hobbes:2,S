long before X is started (which doesn't happen by
default on my setup), btw X works fine

yes, just tried that, the boot looks like this:
first, I end up in the bootloader yaboot, which
asks me (in a very small font) which kernel to
boot, then, for example, I enter 
	linux2616 init=/bin/bash
after that, the screen goes white for half a second
and becomes black with a large terminal font on it
(the one I get without framebuffer, I think), the
text there is printed undistorted ... shortly after
that, I get a flash, and the mode switches to a much
smaller font (the final framebuffer font) and the
kernel messages written there are already distorted.
half a second later (or less) the penguin appears at
the top area (undistorted), when the bootup is done
I get the following prompt (which again is okay)
	bash-2.05b#
typing anything there is distorted again ...
pressing enter several times leaves 'copies' of
the caracters on the screen, forming vertical bars
the prompt (bash) is now always fine, the copy one
line above (as all the others) is distorted ...
note, the bootup is not much different with older
kernels, except for the strange distortions ...
attached my kernel configuration, just in case
it is related ...
TIA,
Herbert
