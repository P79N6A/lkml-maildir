Thanks.  I am bouncing this to lkml since this at the moment does not
appear to be a kexec issue.
I just checked and initial ramdisks work.
The kernel messages I see look like:

That message is because of your root=/dev/ram command line,
and really has nothing to do with your initial ramdisk.

Perhaps you did not compile in initrd support?

Unless you have gotten quite creative I doubt it.  Looking at
all of the kernel messages would have been more interesting.

See above.
