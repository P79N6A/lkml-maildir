Yes.  The LED subsystem is a really cool idea, because what good are
blinkenlights if you have to write shell scripts to control them?  The
kernel should do that for you!  (/me wishes someone made a laptop with
something like 8 LED's of different colors, so he could just make them
do what he liked.)

I'm willing to take a first whack at it, if you can put me in touch with
someone to test it.
