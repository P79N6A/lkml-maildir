But most of this will be lost on exec(2). Also, it is my impression that
the tree of _running_ processes isn't usually very deep (Say init --> X -->
[Random processes] --> [compilations &c], this would make 5 or 6 deep, no
more. Should take a pstree(1) listing on a busy machine and work out some
statistics... here (a personal worstation) the tree is very fat at the
first level below init(8), and just 5 deep when running pstree(1)). Sure,
all processes will all end up sharing glibc, and the graphical stuff will
share the X &c libraries, so this would end up being a win this way.
