which is valid for a single kernel image that supports boxes both with
and without eisa (ie, vendor kernels).

no it doesn't, which is the whole purpose of the patch I sent.
try it..
modprobe 3c509
lsmod | grep 3c509     # module didnt stay around
find /sys | grep 3c509 # oh look, it left crap in sysfs

We have multiple levels of initcalls for a reason. Whilst they suck in a lot
of ways, they can be used to enforce dependancies like this.

Why is this even an issue so late on? Bus probing should have been done as
part of bootup. By the time I get to modprobing device drivers, it should have
been determined already.
Your argument seems to be "probing is hard, so we don't do it", which is
just *wrong*.
