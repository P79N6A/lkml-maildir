I think the key to this failure is the last line here ..

This then blows up the next access to intel_i810_private.registers, which happens to
be intel_i810_insert_entries.
Either we need .suspend methods which unmap these regions, or we need
to skip trying to map them a second time on resume.
There's an ugly patch below which does the latter. Give it a try?
The intel-agp suspend/resume code has really grown into something
of a monster, and could use some refactoring in a big way.
