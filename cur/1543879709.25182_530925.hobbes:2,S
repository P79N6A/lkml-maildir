You mean the X + mp3 player + audio visualization test?  X+Gforce
visualization have problems getting half of my box in the presence of
two other heavy cpu using tasks.  Behavior is _much_ better than
RSDL/SD, but the synchronous nature of X/client seems to be a problem.  
With this scheduler, renicing X/client does cure it, whereas with SD it
did not help one bit.  (I know a trivial way to cure that, and this
framework makes that possible without dorking up fairness as a general
policy.)
