I think you totally misunderstood the thing...
Umbrella is a scheme that allow the user to restrict the capabilities of
a process within his own processes. Preventing the process to fork is
ONE thing that can be restricted but they might be plenty of others.
The idea is that each process originating from this process will inherit
from this restriction (and possibly have some more) and can NEVER been
granted to restore this capability again.
Now, this has a direct application to restrict the harm that can cause a
buffer-overflow, but nobody said that it would stop them...

Right. Now who wants to volunteered to find a simple and yet efficient
solution to this problem? :-)
