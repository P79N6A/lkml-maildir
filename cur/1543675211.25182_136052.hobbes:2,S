Yes, it should. It has some extended features, which are only visible 
through new ioctl, though.

I'd leave this to a later patch.

That's very difficult. I just had a look through the cvs changelogs and 
talked to a collegue: apparently, there haven't been any important 
bugfixes to the code -- only the major cleanups to get the code into 
"kernel shape" (typdef removals, use 16 instead of uint16_t, ...)
It would cause me a major pain to separate these diffs, because I did 
not tag the code very often. (my fault, I know)
The code just "works" for the dvb-subsystem, so I hope there is nothing 
to worry about for other coders.

Ok, comes with the next patch.

It's already hard enough to make all these changes, make sure everything 
compiles and works for both 2.4 and 2.5, then create the patches and ... 
get rejected. 8-)
If there aren't any other objections, I'd like to ask to apply these 
patches.
The "kernel thread uses BKL" issue works for us, but can reviewed by the 
  responsible author of course.
CU
Michael.
