Thanks for the feedback.  You've asked a lot of good questions, some of
which have been answered in subsequent posts.  Instead of attempting to 
answer them all now, we'll make sure we take them into account as we 
update and fix the original proposal.  I'll answer a couple though.

I would not expect translations to be done for each and every version. 
Not is the expectation that EVERY prink would be converted, only those that
report errors.
Distros could be motivated to provide translations, etc. for the kernel 
versions that they base new releases on.  It would just have to make
sense for them financially to translate and supplement what's in the
templates AND be an accepted/expected practice in the community (based on
some Distro feedback).
