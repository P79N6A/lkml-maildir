Ok, let's try again:
You're changing this (pageattr.c)
                asm volatile("clflush (%0)" :: "r" (adr + i));
into this:
		asm volatile("clflush %0" : "+m" (*(char __force*)(adr + i)));
The original one calls clflush with (adr + i), the new one with (*(adr
+ i)). Are these calls equivalent? if not, and I don't think they are,
you are changing the semantics of the code (presumably, because it
fixes a bug), and *that should be a separate patch*.
Cheers,
Muli
