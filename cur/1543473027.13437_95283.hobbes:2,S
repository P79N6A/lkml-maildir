I have noticed that loopback traffic is routed via lo even when there is no match in the routing table. I am not sure whether this is THE RIGHT THING(tm). Anyways: How would the correct route look like?
Also I have noticed a very high packet loss after a short initial timeout when flood pinging 127.0.0.1.
