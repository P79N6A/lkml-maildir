__devinitdata is for non-const data.
__devinitconst is for const data.
You cannot mix const and non-const data in the same section,
if you do so gcc will complain.
It may build for you if all uses of __devinitdata in the
same source file is either const or non-const but when you
mix it then it breaks.
So please use the correct annotation.

We do small incremental steps whenever we can. The challenge is
often to split up patches and not to combine them.
Where we combine two patches this is when the second patch fix
a bug in the first patch.
