Once the io goes through generic_make_request() you shouldn't look at
bh->b_private until the io has completed.  At which point it will have
been correctly set back to the value it had when submitted.
The problem with jbd wasn't the fact that it used it, but the fact
that it peeked while the io was in flight.
This is ugly I know, much cleaner in 2.6 where there is a split
between bh and bio.
