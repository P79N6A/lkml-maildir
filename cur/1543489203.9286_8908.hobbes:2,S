For reference, the choice isn't arbitrary on all chips.  The PPC takes a
minor performance hit when operating in LE mode and does some inconvenient
things when in LE mode (resulting in more work needing to be done in
software).
It's not clear yet that the ia64 is a sane architecture.
}So, anyways, with a sane cpu it's a non-issue.
