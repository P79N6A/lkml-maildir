I was worried about this too.

I had missed this, and yeah, that's some level of comfort.
But I'm not convinced we can guarantee that's safe.  The positive  
return code that aio_rw_vect_retry() sees is telling it that some IO  
has completed and, arguably, that no more IO is in flight.  If we  
return partial progress from generic_file_aio_read() while we have an  
iocb in a wait queue then we are adding yet another invariant.  That  
while an iocb is pending from a previous call down the call chain, we  
can't return a non-aio negative error.  Doing so would cause fs/aio.c  
to complete while there is still an iocb on a wait queue from a  
previous retry attempt.  Right?
I also noticed something just now while poking around these paths to  
see if I could get the start of generic_file_aio_read() to fail when  
it had previously succeeded.  What's to stop another task from racing  
to set O_DIRECT between retries?
That sounds like a pretty hilarious way to get a read retry to fail  
due to buffer misalignment while a previously buffered instance of it  
is still in flight.  Hi-larious.
In thinking about this a discussing it with Chris a bit, I wonder if  
the right fix isn't to refuse changing O_DIRECT via setfl() once any  
IO paths have started on the filp.  Something like:
	filp->frozen_flags |= O_DIRECT
at the start of paths and check it in setfl()?
Are we similarly worried about O_APPEND?
