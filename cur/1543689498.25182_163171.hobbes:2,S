Ok, at least, I learned one thing !
Eventually, I've found a workaround ; I've been taught that I can write 
directly at the serial port address (I tought it wasn't permitted by the 
serial module), so that's what I do since I've got to send only one caracter 
(sort of acknowledge).
Now I'm trying to find out why the tcsetattr of my termios configuration fails 
(the thing work at 9600 bauds but not at 115200).
Thanks,
