Nobody reads ALSA bugzilla. You are probably right but its not clear,
and if the audio is going the video component might as well go too.
Have you checked with the ARM people or the person who added support (
pwaechtler@loewe-komp.de) ?
It's also used in various appliances people "adjust" to run Linux - the
Philips AOL-TV for example. Also on the SH reference boards for the
hitachi sh series cpus (arch/sh*).

Think it should stay for now at least. Pointing at ALSA bugzilla as
proof of non-use is not a good test.
