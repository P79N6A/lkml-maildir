Proc files are not always on the system. As far as I
know you have to chose in the Kernl-Configuration.
And second of all I had some problem with a  debian
distrubotion. I dont know for what reason there was no
USB given in the /proc/... Files. But lspci did found 
it. And the Kernel was correctly configurated. I didnt
solved that problem. i just installed Kubuntu and
everybody was happy. For that reason I dont trust
/proc files anymore.

Lspci do find other Hardware as well. Like USB,
Ethernet, ISA, Firewire...
