Um, not sure, but the idea of defragmenting SLAB entries might be
similar to moving them, ie migration. But how to solve the per-SLAB
referencing is another story... =)

I patched the kernel on my desktop machine to provide some numbers.
The zoneinfo file and a small patch is attached.
$ uname -r
2.6.14-rc5-git3
$ uptime
 20:27:47 up 1 day,  6:27, 18 users,  load average: 0.01, 0.13, 0.15
$ cat /proc/zoneinfo | grep present
        present  4096
        present  225280
        present  30342
$ cat /proc/zoneinfo | grep tscanned
        tscanned 151352
        tscanned 3480599
        tscanned 541466
"tscanned" counts how many pages that has been scanned in each zone
since power on. Executive summary assuming that only LRU pages exist
in the zone:
DMA: each page has been scanned ~37 times
Normal: each page has been scanned ~15 times
HighMem: each page has been scanned ~18 times
So if your user space page happens to be allocated from the DMA zone,
it looks like it is more probable that it will be paged out sooner
than if it was allocated from another zone. And this is on a half year
old P4 system.

But is the DMA zone itself evil, or just that we have one LRU per zone...?
