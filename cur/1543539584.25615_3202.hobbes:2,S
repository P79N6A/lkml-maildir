If it's possible without CAP_SYS_RAW, then yes, it's kernel's fault AND SHOULD
BE FIXED (it's possible now without CAP_SYS_RAW AFAIK). If it's possible with
CAP_SYS_RAW it's program's fault. So Andre was correct: fix is needed
(since AFAIK currently you CAN do this without CAP_SYS_RAW) but it was not
correct as well: his "fix" was just to add bunch of checks instead of few
(or one?) "capable(CAP_SYS_RAW)" checks.

ONLY if you have no CAP_SYS_RAW. If you have you CAN do whatever you want with
hardware.

No problem: with CAP_SYS_RAW you can do it anyway.

See above.

You networking example is GREAT. You even not realising just HOW GOOD it is.
Let's take one more look on it: we have broken kernel (it'll panic when you'll
do nasty things with sockets - for example linux kernel 2.2.15) and broken
program (it's trying to do such nasty things - any version of PostgreSQL).
And now you are proposing to add fix in middleware (in GLibC). What you'll
get as responce ? "Are you idiot, or what ? It's kernel's fault, not GLibC's
fault! Go and fix it in kernel instead!". And that's exactly what was done
(fix is in 2.2.16 and recent 2.4.0-testX kernels). BTW: it's not hypotetic
example but that's what REALLY happened: I found that PostgreSQL can provocate
kernel panic by abusing sockets and then this problem was fixed. In kernel
(that is: where it was introduced in first place), not in GLibC. In our case
we can not even TRY to fix broken hardware (if user have raw access to hardware
that is; if user DOES not have raw access to hardware then indeed he should not
be allowed to damage even broken hardware): it's task for hardware manufaturers,
not for linux developers.

It should be few lines to check if user have CAP_SYS_RAW for potentially
dangerous commands. That's all. Nothing more, nothing less. NO heuristics.
