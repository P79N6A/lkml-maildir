Back on the 32-way, in this set of tests we're running 12 disks spread out through the 8 cells of the 32-way. Each disk will have an Ext2 FS placed on it, a clean Linux kernel source untar()ed onto it, then a full make (-j4) and then a make clean performed. The 12 series are done in parallel - so each disk will have:
mkfs
tar x
make
make clean
performed. This was performed ten times, and the overall averages are presented below - note this is Jens' original patch sequence NOT the kthread one (those results available tomorrow, hopefully).

Hopefully, the first column is self-explanatory - these are the settings applied to the queue_affinity, completion_affinity and rq_affinity tunables. Due to the fact that the standard deviations are so large coupled with the very close average results, I'm not seeing anything in this set of tests to favor any of the combinations...
As noted, I will be having the machine run the kthreads-variant of the patch stream tonight, and then I have to go back and run a non-patched kernel to see if there are any /regressions/.
