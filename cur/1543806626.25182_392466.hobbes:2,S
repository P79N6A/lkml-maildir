Okay, so why I'm still getting these MCEs?
MCE 0
CPU 0 4 northbridge TSC 91ec03f09330
ADDR 104500000
  Northbridge GART error
       bit61 = error uncorrected
  TLB error 'generic transaction, level generic'
STATUS a40000000005001b MCGSTATUS 0
They are supposed to be disabled by the quirks routine, aren't they?
