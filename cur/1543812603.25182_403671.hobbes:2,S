I'm just wondering about the name of the single attribute that reflects
the status of the current actual brightness value that the driver has
chosen.

If all the events that could influence the backlight were available in
userspace, I'd agree but they're not. There might be a need for a daemon
in userspace for various reasons depending on the application but I'm
not concerned about that.

So the user powers down the LCD, the FB blanking then blanks and
unblanks. What should the current LCD power status be? The LCD should
still be off as far as I can see yet the LCD/backlight class doesn't do
this at present.
I'm beginning to favour a system where backlight drivers only provide
two functions:
int (*set_status)(struct backlight_device *, int brightness, int power, int fb_blank);
int (*get_status)(struct backlight_device *);
set_status passes the user requested brightness and power values along
with the current fb_blanking status to the driver. The driver can then
set the hardware up as appropriate. 
get_status returns the brightness for the current configuration.
The backlight core itself keeps track of the requested power and
brightness values rather than having every backlight driver including
the logic. This has the advantage of keeping behaviour the same and
avoiding subtle logic bugs of which there are several at the moment.
This also means that "echo 31 > brightness; cat brightness" will always
give the expected answer of whatever brightness the user is requesting
and the actual current driver brightness choice is available through
"cat driver_brightness".
Does this seem reasonable?
