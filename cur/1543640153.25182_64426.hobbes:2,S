this is a simple and well-defined thing: if the thread exits by calling
the exit() function then libc calls the exit_thread_group() syscall [part
of my POSIX signals patch] and zaps all threads. This is a very clearly
defined thing in POSIX.
SIGABRT/SIGFPE if uncaught cause a segmentation fault that zaps all
threads (the kernel does this zapping). [note that for this you'll have to
use the POSIX signals patch i mentioned earlier.]

POSIX says that in this case (when eg. non-threaded POSIX code calls
exit()) all threads must exit and a status code is sent to the parent of
the threaded application. And this is precisely how it works.

as long as you are using libc there are certain POSIX rules that must be
followed. NGPT has to do the same.
non-POSIX programming methods like JVMs can still implement *any*
semantics - but your whole example is based on POSIX issues like exit() or
default signal handlers, not Java.
