Ok, after trying all four combinations (call to wmb() moved or not, and
set_user(0, 1) vs set_user(0, 0)), it turns out all four exhibit
skipping, so that's unrelated (in fact, it seems to happen not on net
access, but on redraw -- mozilla's dialogs make xmms skip, too).
The call to set_user() definitely changes the behavior of the directory
in /proc as we expected.
I suppose I'll have to wait for the low latency patch to be updated to
the latest ac kernel; that appears to have been the reason there wasn't
any skipping in my 2.4.18-pre3-ac2.  I tried porting it myself, but the
rejects were significant enough to confuse me, so I'll wait.
I'll leave it for someone else to decide what arguments to set_user()
exec_usermodehelper() should pass.
Thanks all!
Danek
