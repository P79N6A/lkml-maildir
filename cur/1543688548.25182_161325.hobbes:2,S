Ok well little wait on the non-patched bootup.
I booted with test4-mm2 patched
Throughput 221.812 MB/sec 16 procs    ext2
Throughput 159.495 MB/sec 16 procs    ext3-extents (definitely enabled)
Throughput 147.598 MB/sec 16 procs    ext3 (patched but disabled)
There is an obvious improvement, but nothing near the 70+% increase you 
saw.  Subsequent runs run anything from a little lower than above for 
extents to 167MB/s.
I'm using the largest inode size possible for ext3 for the filesystem 
tested.
By the way, what's the behavior of opening an existing non-extent file 
and writing and reading to it while the partition is mounted with 
extents enabled?
