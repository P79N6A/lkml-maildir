So I would like to ask you what an user should do when facing what is
probably a timing-related bug, as it appears I have the bad luck
of hitting one.
See for example my comments after this one 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10117#c11
This same problem is still present with yesterday's git, and sometimes
it hangs without hpet=disable and sometimes it doesn't. (And never
with hpet=disable in the boot command line)
And when it hangs I can see only _one_ "Switched to high resolution mode
on CPU x" message before the hang point, and when it boots fine there
is always the two of them in sequence:
Switched to high resolution mode on CPU 1
Switched to high resolution mode on CPU 0
And using vga=6 or vga=0x0364 makes a difference in the probability
of hanging.
I am just waiting -rc1 to be released to send an email with my
problem again, as I am unable to debug this myself.
I think this is ok from my part, right?
