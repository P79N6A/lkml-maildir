Hi, all,
I got a ATI HDTV module. I can use insmod to work
on it. Now I want to make it a character driver
in my new kernel. Then I can directly use it
in kernel booting, and printk on it.
How to change module to character driver?
Where can I get some information about it?
If someone knows, please help me. Thanks.
Barry
