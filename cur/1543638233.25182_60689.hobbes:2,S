Hi!
In 2.5.29, something changed with cursor. It now honours palette
setting; I liked previous behaviour more.
There are bad problems with repainting. Fire text editor (emacs), type
few words, move cursor few words back at the first letter of the word,
and start typing. I can get corruption of next letter within 20
keystrokes.
