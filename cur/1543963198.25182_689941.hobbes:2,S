I think the point you're missing is that any patches written by
Christoph need a line like
From: Christoph Lameter <clameter@sgi.com>
at the top of the body so that Christoph becomes the author when it is
committed into git.  The Signed-off-by: line needs to be preserved too
of course, but it is not sufficient by itself.
