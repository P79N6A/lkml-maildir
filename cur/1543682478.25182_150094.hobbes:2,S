I tried your config (with just one change, i enabled reiserfs, i use it for my
root fs) but It's the same. /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/ is just empty, no
change.
I tried with gcc 2.95.4 (as shipped with debian testing) and gcc 3.3.1 (same)
but neither solved to problem.
What else could be the Problem? I assume problems loading modules or such
userspace problems can't cause this behaviour?
Any help diagnosing the problem appricatied,
Martin H.
