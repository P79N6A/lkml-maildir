We no longer have kernel/ksyms.c.

Weird.  and still happens on -test8 when ext{2,3} is built as a module.
(CONFIG_SMP)
nm lists percpu_counter_mod in lib/lib.a but nm does not list that
symbol in .tmp_vmlinux{1,2}.  It's being dropped for some reason...
I can cause a similar problem by trying to call __div64_32() from
ext3/super.c (just as a test).
