Thanks a lot for the patches.

Unfortuanetly I can't just pull (I'm not allowed to use bitkeeper). I
could roll them into one big patch and then push them to akpm on my
own, but that would loose history :-(.
Patches #1 .. #4 are trivial enough to go in as soon as you want. I'd
prefer the rest of the patches to be tested in -mmX kernels a bit (for
a testing and so that I can do x86-64 support).. Comments to specific
patches follow.
