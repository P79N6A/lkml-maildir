btw, which part of the kernel is responsible for finding out if devfs is in use or not _even_ when devfs is not compiled in? There seems to be a problem here, why is there any code running in my kernel to find out if devfs "exists" or not even when its not compiled in? Its not available as module is it?
According to that osdl bug report page it seems this thing is almost unnoticed.
I really don't like to see error messages even if they are harmless...(a tiny bit of my cpu power was used to remove a virtual device that doesn't exist, and also to display the error message on the screen, and not to mention that it actually increases the kernel image size by a few bytes using a few extra bytes of my precious ram)
