Hi Hans,
    I dont have an answer for you, but it would be nice to know the answer.
Would it be difficult to measure this?  It should not be difficult to make
a machine dual boot Linux and BSD, and then we can measure the differences.
If there is a significant performance difference either way then we can
try and investigate it to see why.
Thanks,
Jim
