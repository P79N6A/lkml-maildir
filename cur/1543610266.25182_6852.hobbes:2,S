	Hello group....
	I have a cluster that I wish to be able to perform a multicast
broadcast over two backbones, primary and secondary, simultaneously. The two
eth's are bound to the same VIP. When I perform the broadcast, it only goes
out on eth0. 
	Is there a way to do this without writing an application to do it?
I've been looking at igmp.c:ip_mc_join_group to do a possible change like:
#ifdef DUAL_MCAST_BIND
   if(!imr->imr_ifindex) {
      imr->ifindex=2;  /* eth0 */
      err=ip_mc_join_group(sk, imr);
      if (!err) {
        imr->ifindex=3; /* eth1 */
        err=ip_mc_join_group(sk, imr);
      }
      return err;
   }
#else
   if(!imr->imr_ifindex)
     in_dev = ip_mc_find_dev(imr);
#endif
	Will this be necessary??? Could there be something in the kerenl to
configure?
PS: Please cc me any response as I'm not yet monitoring this group.
