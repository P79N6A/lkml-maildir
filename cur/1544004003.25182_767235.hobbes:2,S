Subject: [PATCH] powerpc: Repair device bindings documentation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Commit d0fc2eaaf4c56a95f5ed29b6bfb609e19714fc16 "powerpc/fsl: Refactor
device bindings" split out a number of device bindings from
booting-without-of.txt into separate files.  Having them all in one file
was a frequent source of merge conflicts.
However, in the next merge, 49997d75152b3d23c53b0fa730599f2f74c92c65, there
was another conflict.  Some of the bindings removed from
booting-without-of.txt were mistakenly added back in and the copies in
dts-bindings were kept as well.
This patch re-removes "Freescale Display Interface" and "Freescale on board
FPGA" and fixes the table of contents.

Maybe this should go in 2.6.28, since it fixes a doc bug and before
anyone modifies the version of the docs that should have been deleted.
