Good for testing, but terrible for high-memory machines which rely on
dcache to maintain performance.  
As an interesting data point, I applied Chuck's last pair of buffer and
page cache hash updates (the new buffer hash function, and the larger
PAGE_HASH_BITS) to a 2.2.5 kernel to measure the impact on a parallel
build of the current glibc-2.1 rpms on a 4-way Xeon.  Each of those two
improvements gained about 30 seconds of wall-clock time on a complete
build, taking it down from 15 minutes to 14.
Adding 4 extra bits to the dcache hash was worth 2 full minutes; 12
minutes total build time.
This was absolutely obvious from the readprofile(8) traces, where
d_lookup() was massively dominating the system CPU time (I had made both
the page and buffer hash lookup functions into externs at this point so
that they would all be profiled separately, not as inlines).  d_lookup
was using about 4 times as much CPU as the nearest other functions
(which iirc were the page fault COW handler and file read() actors, both
of which perform large copies).
Shrinking the dcaches excessively in this case will simply masaccre the
performance.  Apparently glibc-2.1 is a particularly heavy test of
stat() performance, but then many other common server workloads are too.
Interestingly, when performing a full kernel build on the same box, the
d_lookup() cost is so low that it is hardly even on the map.
Cheers,
 Stephen
