Subject: [03/07] I2C: Fix incorrect sysfs file permissions in it87 and via686a drivers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
The it87 and via686a hardware monitoring drivers each create a sysfs
file named "alarms" in R/W mode, while they should really create it in
read-only mode. Since we don't provide a store function for these files,
write attempts to these files will do something undefined (I guess) and
bad (I am sure). My own try resulted in a locked terminal (where I
attempted the write) and a 100% CPU load until next reboot.
As a side note, wouldn't it make sense to check, when creating sysfs
files, that readable files have a non-NULL show method, and writable
files have a non-NULL store method? I know drivers are not supposed to
do stupid things, but there is already a BUG_ON for several conditions
in sysfs_create_file, so maybe we could add two more?
