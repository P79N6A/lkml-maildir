The one I ran into problems with is reporting
X Window System Version 6.9.0
Release Date: 21 December 2005
(used in SLES10, the specific package version is xorg-x11-6.9.0-50.14)

The masking is done primarily to (a) calculate the correct length (from a BAR's
perspective), as I don't want to write the BAR if its length doesn't match the
expectation, and (b) to properly report the new value in the printk.

Of course I also opened a bug against X, as I too think it's doing something
wrong here.
