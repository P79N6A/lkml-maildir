The nice thing of having it in the VFS is to try to provide the same
semantics to all underlying filesystems. When possible I think we should
make all lowlevel filesystem behaving in the same way.

I don't like having only coda breaking the semantic. You'll end getting
reports of "program X doesn't work with coda, why?". If you'll break the
semantic in the VFS the program will be fixed ASAP and you'll never get
the report in the middle of a stable kernel.
This is at least my point of view.
