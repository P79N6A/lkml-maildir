The justification is that it doesn't properly describe the variable size
(think userspace 32 bit variable vs. kernelspace 32 bit variable.)  We
need to stick with the proper __u32 type variables for data that crosses
the userspace/kernelspace boundry.
See Linus's posts about this topic on lkml in the past for more details
about this.
