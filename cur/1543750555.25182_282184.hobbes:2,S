The popf part is very nice in that it allows you to single-step and debug 
this thing.
The fact is, I can't debug Wine. The code-base is just too alien for me, 
so to debug this thing I needed to come up with a silly example of TF 
usage, and try to debug _that_ instead as if it were something unknown (ie 
debugging by knowing what the program does is a no-no, since that would 
have defeated the whole exercise).
And handlign "popf" correctly really was the only sane way to debug it, 
anything else would never have worked in a real-life debugging situation. 
It's easy enough to say "well, just do it by hand", but that's not 
practical when you debug with "si 1000" to try to pinpoint the behaviour a 
bit.
And clearly my debuggability exercise seem to have worked, since the end
result apparently ended up doing the right thing for Wine.
This is why debuggability is important. I realize that people may think 
I'm inconsistent (since I abhor kernel debuggers), but while _I_ abhor 
debuggers, I also think that the primary objective of an operating system 
is to make easy things easy, and hard things possible, so while I don't 
much like debuggers, I consider it a fundamental failure if the kernel 
doesn't have proper support for them.
So I think it's worth splitting out the "popf" part of the patch, but even
if that one doesn't actually matter for Warcraft, I'd put it in just so 
that we have a state where we're _supposed_ to be able to debug things 
with TF in them. Just having the mental expectation that things like that 
should work is important - otherwise we'll eventually end up having some 
other subtle problem with TF handling.
