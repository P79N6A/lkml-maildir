It would be possible, but I would only add it when there are actual
problems with the current solution.
It looks like a bit of a hack.

That would require much more callbacks into the filesystem. The VFS changes
the times, but it doesn't know what the resolution of the file system is.
In theory it could help a bit when the rounding is needed, but again
to avoid overengineering early I would like to first see if the current
KISS way works out well enough.
[note that when you want the "only flush once a second" optimization back
you would need some of these callbacks anyways, so when doing it it may
be a good idea to merge it with early increase]

Probably yes. But it's also much more intrusive for the kernel code.
It also has the drawback that the application can see times in the future
in stat.
e.g. when someone does
	touch file
	stat(file, &st)
	gettimeofday(&now) 
	tvsub(&diff, &now, &st.st_mtime_ts)
Then diff may actually be negative.  Which could also in theory break stuff.
So you would trade one breakage for another. Let's see if KISS works out
first :-)
