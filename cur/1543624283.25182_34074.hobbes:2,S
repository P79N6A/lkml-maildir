I'd rather have the rule that you can turn off this feature altogther: if
the command is so esoteric that it's not part of the regular commands we
can generate on our own, 99% of all people probably aren't even interested
in it.
If the command is useful on its own, and has a generic meaning (ie across
a large subset of users), then I think the kernel should support it
through a _real_ interface, not through some "pass user data though
inscathed" thing. Because that generic meaning probably exists even
outside ATA drives.
