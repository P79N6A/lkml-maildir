Same experience as with 2.4.19pre7 that I descrived on my previous mail to
Anton Blanchard and the list, have a look at it for details. The card is
well detected but packages are being lost (this only happens when the
machine is booted from the net, just like in 2.4.18). If nobody else sees
this maybe it is a problem with the release of this openfirmware which just
fucks the card when using it :-?
Thanks a lot!
