Yeah. It's the same behavior as before then, as everybody would try to
load the thermal module on all i386/x86_64 machines anyway.
Would be great if Bob could give a short comment, maybe I start digging
a bit deeper if I find the time to find out why this is and how this can
get workarounded (in another way, already looks like a workaround).

I don't know. Maybe Kay could give a comment whether it's useful/common
to have the PNPwxyz:00 path in /sys/../acpi/... to be evaluated to e.g.
a battery:00 or ac_adapter:00 path name.
IMO it is useful. Any user who knows about linux, but has no idea about
ACPI will find battery info by simply "find /sys |grep battery".
Disadvantage would be the size of the strings mapping to the PNP ids, I
think it's not that bad.
OTH you stick to the spec name of the device.
No idea what is better/nicer, but we should decide before 2.6.23...
For the latter we could add another documentation file,
acpi_hids_mapping.txt listing all supported Hids?
Userspace (HAL) would need to know about the ids then..., maybe these
guys have any preferences?

As this is ACPICA code, can you do this, you have to touch it anyway?
In general, I try(ied) to separate ACPICA code in a separate patch. Does
it make sense to directly patch against the ACPICA package (maybe not at
the moment, but if the next update comes out -> nothing urgent, but I
expect the current version has diverged a lot)?
