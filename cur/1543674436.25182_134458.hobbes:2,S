Hello all!
I've just installed RH 7.3 on a machine with all-SCSI discs. I had to load 
"linux dd" with Adaptec AIC 79xx driver floppy installed, but that's ok. 
The / is mounted from /dev/sdb1. 
So, I got a clean 2.4.20 kernel, added AIC 79xx driver sources to the kernel 
source tree, configured and compiled and installed it (of course, I didn't 
forget about the modules).
In lilo, I said "root=/dev/sdb1" just as for the original 2.4.18-3 RedHat 
kernel which boots ok.
When I boot the new kernel, I get:
VFS: Cannot open root device at "811" or "08:11"
From SCSI-howto I got that 08:11 stands for /dev/sda11. Why would /dev/sdb1 be 
converted to 08:11 instead of 08:17 (again, corresponding to SCSI-howto)?
Would I be able to boot the kernel if I say "root=817"?
I will try tommorow when I get to that machine, but mabe you have some 
suggestions...
Thank you very much for reading all this.
Good luck!
Artemio.
