Quick review comments:
1. Why hack up vmlinux.lds.h? wouldn't declaring rio_route_ops
to be a constant do what you want?
2. Unnecessary initializers
+struct bus_type rio_bus_type = {
+	.name = "rapidio",
+	.match = rio_match_bus,
+	.suspend = NULL,
+	.resume = NULL,
	NULL is unnecessary here.
3. Use existing macro's
+#define DEBUG
+
+#ifdef DEBUG
+#define DBG(x...) printk(x)
+#else
+#define DBG(x...)
+#endif
+
	Use pr_debug() and isn't this debugged yet?
4. Lists should be static if possible
+
+LIST_HEAD(rio_mports);
	static LIST_HEAD(rio_mports)
5. rio_nets defined but not used (if it is used later then
   make it visible to only that code.)
6. rio_net_lock does it need to be global.
   also maybe a name change to rio_global_list_lock
