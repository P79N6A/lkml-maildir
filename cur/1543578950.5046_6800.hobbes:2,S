Hello,
When the 'console' is mapped to a serial device, i.e., /dev/ttyS0,
if a terminal, without modem control is connected, no text is displayed.
If a terminal is connected, it is often just 3-wires, i.e, RX/TX/GND.
I need to disable modem control, i.e., hardware slow-control.
It used to be that CLOCAL  was sufficient in the c_cflag member of
the termios structure.  Then a flag, CRTSCTS was put into c_cflag member
also.  I could do:
	tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &termios);
        termios.c_cflag &= ~CRTSCTS;
        termios.c_cflag |= CLOCAL;
        tcsetattr(STDIN_FILENO, TCSANOW, &termios);
This worked up to Linux version 2.2.17 or thereabouts.
This no longer is the case. It compiles and executes without errors, but
does absolutely nothing!  So, how do I initialize a serial link to ignore
RTS/CTS on version 2.4.0... ?
FYI, I tried......
	ioctl(fd, TIOCMGET, &modem);
        modem &= ~TIOCM_RTS;
//        modem &= ~TIOCM_CTS;
//        modem &= ~TIOCM_DTR;
        ioctl(fd, TIOCMSET, &modem);
... and other such guesses without any success.
Also:
	`cp textfile /dev/ttyS0`    # Waits forever
	`cat textfile >/dev/ttyS0`  # Waits forever
	but....
	`ls >dev/ttyS0`             # Executes 
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
