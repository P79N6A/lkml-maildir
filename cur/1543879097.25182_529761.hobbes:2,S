According to Documentation/kbuild/, if FOO .. endif is interpreted as if
each option inside the if block had 'depends on FOO'.
If _every_ option under a menu (and that's another reason why I did not
modify _all_ Kconfig menus) has a 'depends on this or that', it can
be substituted by an if block, and yes, I take that as a simplification
since the whole LoC count goes down. What would perhaps be cool is
some indent in Kconfig to see what an if-endif block spans, but currently
this is not much needed, since two nested ifs are quite the max.
