I think it would be better to move the pci_enable_device(pdev);
above all this, as we should enable the device before reading the
pdev->resource[] too iirc.
Something like this maybe ?
  	i = pci_enable_device (pdev);
  	if (i)
  		return i;
  	ioaddr = pci_resource_start (pdev, 0);
  	if (!ioaddr || ((pci_resource_flags (pdev, 0) & IORESOURCE_IO) == 0)) {
  		printk (KERN_ERR "ne2k-pci: no I/O resource at PCI BAR #0\n");
 	irq = pdev->irq;
Comments?

Davej.
