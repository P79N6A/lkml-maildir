And I was very careful to ask for a specific counter example.  In theory, 
I'm sure you may be right, but theory doesn't count.  We were discussing
how to show that the code was the same, in other words, we're in the
context of practice, you said it wouldn't work, and I said show me an
example.  You don't get to fall back on theory, I specifically asked for
a real world example.

Right.  I already agreed that the trivial cases would do it.  What about
stdio?  That's pretty simple set of interfaces, and I doubt that even
the gnu one and the v7 one compile to the same expression tree.
Let's put it this way: do you know of any expression tree, compiled
from two from scratch different implementations of the same thing,
with more than 5000 nodes, which results in the same thing?  Not only
do you not, I'd go so far as to predict you'll never find one no matter
how long you look.  Sure, you limit the solution space down to something
like strcmp, the set of possible expression trees is probably in single
digits or so.  That doesn't prove anything other than you're looking at
a simplistic case.
