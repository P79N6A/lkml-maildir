Hi !
Well, although I usually don't like these endless coding-style threads, why
don't you simply use this common form ? :
    return !!(foo & MASK);
I found that the compilers like it much and easily emit conditionnal set
instructions. Eg, on x86, this should be something like :
   testl MASK, foo
   setnz retcode
Cheers,
Willy
