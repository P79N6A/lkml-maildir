alsa-lib doesn't rely on it at all. The devices in /dev/snd/ might be 
created in these ways:
1) static - using the mknod command
2) using devfs
3) link /dev/snd to /proc/asound/dev
We prefered the third solution because we were changing heavily the device
minor numbers in the past. We can remove the proc dynamic device creating
from our code now. I agree, this code should not be in the kernel tree.
