And how do you propose to handle a kernel developer that wants to add a 
new feature (a scheduling class, for instance) and make it available to 
userspace apps?
For the sched class example, the standard says, "Four scheduling 
policies are defined; others may be defined by the implementation."  I 
would like to make it easy for kernel developers to extend the 
implementation and expose that to userspace.
It would be nice to have apps be able to include <linux/sched.h> and get 
the *real* kernel sched.h userspace export.  Then when I add 
SCHED_NEW_CLASS to the kernel, userspace can pick up the changes without 
me having to modify glibc headers as well.

I would prefer to have the standard userspace kernel headers be owned by 
the kernel.  If we do it right, we could go back to the days of the 
symlink to the headers of the real running kernel.  As far as I can 
tell, that's the only way to avoid having to make changes in multiple 
places.
