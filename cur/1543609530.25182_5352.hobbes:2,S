What _may_ be a very interesting tool for doing "real-world" I/O generation
is to use the InterMezzo KML (kernel modification log), which is basically
a 100% record of every filesystem operation done (e.g. create, write,
delete, mkdir, rmdir, etc).
Peter, do you have any very large KML files which would simulate the usage
of a filesystem over a long period of time, or would Tacitus have something
like that?
Cheers, Andreas
