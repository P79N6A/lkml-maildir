Hi,
	I check the kernel archive and found reference to the PCI interrupt clash 
between the 2940 (aic7xxx) and other cards. I also have the problem and it 
can lock up my entire machine.
The problem really rears its head when I  overclock my box (BX400 dual PIII 
450 MHZ) by as little as 10% (504 MHz, 112 MHZ bus). Both my soundblaster 
live and my onboard AIC7891 are assigned IRQ 19. My PCI slots are full 
(ethernet, 1394 card, soundblaster live, tv card, and Matrox G400). I 
enclose the win2k interrupt allocation for your perusal and comment (it's 
weird!)
Current kernel version is 2.4.17 but the problem has been evident since 
2.4.5 (at least). The 2.2 series does not exhibit the problem.

I hope someone can shed some light on the very high (>20) interrupt 
numbers. I'd really like and will help to get to the bottom of the problem.
