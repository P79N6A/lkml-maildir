Yep, Nigel fixes typo every time I show him one. That only shows how
old his code is, and how little review it got.
That's not making patch acceptable. His patch still duplicates lots of
kernel code, and puts code into kernelspace that can be done userspace
as well.
If you want to merge some code in kernelspace, you should do it in
small pieces, and should understand what existing code does. Nigel
does not care what existing code does. If swsusp contained problem 2
years ago, but mainline fixed it, Nigel still includes his
workarounds. (See his bitmap stuff). That's not the way to go.
