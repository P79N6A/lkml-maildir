	I agree that ARM should eventually merge with the generics, but this
shouldn't be a requirement for RT .. I've already shown that it isn't
needed for RT . 
	I don't want to create different IRQ threading code for each non
generic architecture .. It's possible to use common code without forcing
maintainers into a difficult situation.
