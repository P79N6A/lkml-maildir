Hello;  bob knight
thank you again for helping me out with fglrx, The build did worked
this time, I received an invalid lvalue with cap_t, but was able to
carry through with just using an old capability.h file.
As for the change_page_attr (I dont think I would of ever gotten that)
nice work; here is what dmesg says:
[    8.823442] Symbol init_mm is marked as UNUSED, however this module
is using it.
[    8.823446] This symbol will go away in the future.
[    8.823448] Please evalute if this is the right api to use, and if
it really is, submit a report the linux kernel mailinglist together
with submitting your code for inclusion.

[   54.785599] [fglrx] Receive enable interrupt message with

I looked on google but didnt find much about init_mm
I'll paste what you gave me on the mactel site so anybody who needs
fglrx on 2.6.25 can get it working to somewhat of an extent.
regards;
