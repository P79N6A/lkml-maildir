Well, EAs are accessed via a special API. The paper also covers that.
Streams, however, are by nature accessed as files; this is what makes
them not EAs. EAs are set and retrieved atomically. Streams can be used
with open(), seek(), read(), write(), etc. This is actually more "unixy"
than EAs, as the usual set of Unix functions and tools can work with
streams unmodified; i.e., without knowledge of a special API. Of course,
cp() is the exception. It would have to be able to enumerate and copy
all the streams.
If you have time, please read over the paper so we don't get into the
same rut we got into last time. :)
