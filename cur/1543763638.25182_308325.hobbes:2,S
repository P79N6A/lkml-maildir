Hi Steve,
Here's yet another round of cleanups for fs/cifs/ - this time it's for 
dir.c. 
I believe this marks the end of the files you wanted done in a specific 
order, so now I'll be going through the remaining ones in arbitrary order.
Just like for the previous files I've split the cleanups into chunks that 
do just one (or a few closely related) thing.
The patches will be sent inline with explanations shortly, but are also 
available here :
