I finally had some time to debug this one a little more
thoroughly.  On two different machines (Shuttle SB61G1) I
get the same results, so I do not believe it is bad hardware...
The bug is as follows:
I have 1 4-port tulip NIC in the machine.  If I generate traffic
between two interfaces, it runs fine.  But, if I start running traffic
on all 4 interfaces, the keyboard quits taking input, and ethernet
traffic stops on at least a few of the interfaces.  I can still ssh
into the machine (via the rtl8139 interface), so at least one of the
processors (I'm using SMP on an P4 HT processor) is working.  I also
enabled NMI and that does not trigger.
I ran the tulip-diag tool, and the third interface seems to be in a bad way:

The interrupt count for eth3 is not increasing.  I tried to bring
down the interface with 'ifconfig eth3 down' and that command hung
as well.
I tried getting sysrq to print out the stack for ifconfig, but
I'm not sure it worked:

I tried this same hardware running RH9 with the 2.4.27 kernel and
it works like a charm.
This is easily repeatable, so please let me know what information I
can offer to help debug this.
Thanks,
Ben
