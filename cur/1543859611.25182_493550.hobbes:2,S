I created a version of your patch that applied to 2.6.19, but it
doesn't compile:
mm/built-in.o: In function `cancel_dirty_page':
slab.c:(.text+0x8964): undefined reference to `task_io_account_cancelled_write'
make[3]: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
It looks like task_io_account_cancelled_write() was added in
http://git.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=7c3ab7381e79dfc7db14a67c6f4f3285664e1ec2
Can the call to task_io_account_cancelled_write() simply be removed
from cancel_dirty_page() for testing the patch with 2.6.19 (since
2.6.19 doesn't seem to have the task I/O accounting) ?
