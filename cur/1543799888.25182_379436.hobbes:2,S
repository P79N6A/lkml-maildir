Hello!
Locally is very simple to exploit buffer overflows in the linux kernel. 
This protections is not
efective very well, so it's possible many attacks... It's possible to 
return in mmap() area,
overwrite values em syscall table and after that run malicious code 
using mmap() to allocate
data and many others schemes and techniques.
Linux is very robust and its resources is very good, but it is not yet 
the solution against buffer overflows.
