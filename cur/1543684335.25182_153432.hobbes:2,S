Subject: [PATCH] Monitor RCU grace period
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch is a culmination of a long investigation of a problem
Robert encountered while doing DoS testing on a linux router. The
symptoms were that the route cache would overflow and it looked
like RCU isn't happening. This particular test had a process
installing many ipv4 routes while a packet flood was going
on.
It turned out that the test had softirqs running on a CPU for
more than 20 seconds at a time, a very bad situation. This required
a mechanism to detect if a CPU is stalled in such manner preventing
user processes from executing. Since RCU already does accounting for
forward progress (context switch/idle/user process detection counter),
such infrastructure can be taken advantage of and I implemented a
simple API rcu_grace_period(int cpu) that returns the length of
the grace period of the current CPU in terms of jiffies. This can be 
used by livelock sensitive code to detect forward progress. This
was used in Robert's test setup to put an upper bound on softirqs
and switch over to using ksoftirqds to avoid long running softirqs
which solved his problem.
The rcu-monitor-grace-period patch monitors only the CPUs that
are currently participating in the grace period. If it has
context switched or there is no RCU pending in the system,
it returns 0. Should there be a need to do this unconditionally,
I can add the support for that too.
Thanks
Dipankar
This patch implements monitoring of rcu grace period so that
it can be used in other places in the kernel for livelock
detection. We monitor the per-cpu quiescent state counter.
We start counting ticks when a cpu starts participating in
a RCU grace period. Every scheduler tick, when we check
if the counter changed, we update this tick if there is no
change. When the counter changes, we reset it. Later on we
can check a stuck cpu by looking at this value. If there is no
rcu going on, we don't monitor the quiescent state counter,
so cpu stalls aren't detected.
