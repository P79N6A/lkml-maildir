Yes. That is what usually happens.

Basicly all the swaped out runnable processes will die when they page fault.
since we're oom basicly all processes are more or less swaped out. as
consequence, at least syslogd dies. if you're lucky and the offending
process dies too meanwhile nothing else bad will happen.
Rik van Riel has presented one of the best solutions i've seen here latelly.
I bet he would like you to test his oom patches.

Solaris does swap overcommit ?

buffers are used for i/o (read/write and such). they hold stuff waiting to
go to disk and ready to go to disk.
cache is page cache, used by mmap and such.
