Plus some special case in the kconfig code that you can somewhere select 
the maturity levels you want to use (currently it's a normal option 
kconfig doesn't have to know anything about).
Remind me, would there be any big advantage after such a change besides
being able to automatically print " (EXPERIMENTAL)" at the end of 
the prompt?

If you are not doing it, noone might do it.
And discusing improvements noone will implement is somehow pointless...
