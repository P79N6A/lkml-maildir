This is why I'm taking it slow, and not rushing to get this upstream :)
I am finding a ton of bugs in each get_irqfunc_irq() driver, so I would 
rather patiently sift through them, and push fixes and cleanups upstream.
Once that effort is done, everything should be in the 'trivial' pile and 
not have the logic that you are worried about (and thus there would be 
no need to add an additional branch to the error handling path).
