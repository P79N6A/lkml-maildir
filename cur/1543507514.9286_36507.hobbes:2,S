	I think I'm having the same problem with 2.2.11 that you're having.
I've got an Adaptec 2940 with a Pinnacle Micro CD-R. On boot, it tries to
probe for the drive and goes into an endless cycle of resetting the SCSI
chain. I haven't had time to mess with it - my solution was just to fall
back to 2.2.10, which worked fine - but it's another data point if you're
interested.
	2.2.12 has the same problem. When I get time, I'll try out 2.3.15
and see what happens...

what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and
be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.  There is
another theory which states that this has already happened.
