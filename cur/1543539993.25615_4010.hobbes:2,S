768M Ram sounds like a Chipset limitation. Especially if the motherboard
uses an AMD-750 chipset. If you can get a board using a VIA KX133 you
can use 2GB ram (but it own't work with a Socket-A/Thunderbird Athlon)
or you can look for a VIA KZ133 (which will work with
Socket-A/Thunderbird Athlon). If you are working closely with AMD
itself, see if they can spot you an AMD 760 (or 760MP) test motherboard
(these two chips are probably not available yet) The -MP version is
going to be an SMP chipset for Athlon. (can't wait!)
