Yeap. That will be my preference. Make a small patch to generalize
prio_tree using the split VMA_PRIO_TREE and GENERIC_PRIO_TREE. A small
patch has a better chance of getting merged too. Giving a strong
reason for the generalization and showing that the VMA_PRIO_TREE
and GENERIC_PRIO_TREE split does not affect performance noticeably,
we can hope to convince Andrew to merge. We can worry about
changing vm_area_struct's layout later.

Yeap. That looks sane. However, if you are planning to produce
a patch, please consider the following names:
	struct prio_tree_node {
		unsigned long start, end;
		struct raw_prio_tree_node prio_tree_node;
	};
I think the r_index and h_index names are only meaningful in
prio_tree.c. My guess is start and end will be more palatable
to users of prio_tree.
Thank you,
Rajesh
