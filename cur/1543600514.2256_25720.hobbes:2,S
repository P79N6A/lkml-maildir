But my timeouts were only 10 seconds -- well below the timeo and retrans
timeout periods.
And my network traffic shows that this is the client causing the problem NOT
the server.
It's the read() that pauses for 10 seconds and then the NFS write
immediately returns EIO.
So...I don't think soft mounts has anything to do with it.
Also...I've now seen this error once more even with the 4096 read/write
sizes.

Morale: Don't use soft mounts: they are prone to these things. If you
insist on using them, then try playing around with the `timeo' and
`retrans' mount variables.
Soft mount timeouts are not only due to network problems, but can
equally well be due to internal congestion. The rate at which the
network can transmit requests is usually (unless you are using
Gigabit) way below the rate at which your machine can generate them.
