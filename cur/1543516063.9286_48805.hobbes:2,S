I thought that that change had already been included, but I seem to
have remembered incorrectly! My 2.9.5 puts a few less prefix bytes in
the bootcode (vs. 2.9.1) and therefore the one byte over was reclaimed
somewhere else, masking the problem. Bummer.
I do like the fact that your solution keeps a few more bytes out of the
bootcode; I think we'll go with it. The original motivation for changing
how bootsect_kludge was called was to kill the fact that the address was
hardcoded in the Makefile. Your way does that without bloating the
bootsector.
Thanks.
Patch attached is Mikael's with an additional hunk that kills the
unneeded push/pop %dx in kill_motor. Should fix everything wrong with the
simple bootsect loader (at the moment :).
(I'm trying to see how we can get rid of bootsect_kludge altogether, too.
Stay tuned.)
