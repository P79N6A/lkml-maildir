And on a PII/400 limited to "mem=64M", a `dbench 60` running with XMMS
1.2.6 did not cause any noticeable audio breakup. This is on 2.4.17 +
rmap10c + ide.2.4.16.12102001 + Bill's original hashed waitqueues patch.
(I should also add that XMMS was not running with realtime priority.)
I'll see if I can produce some numbers in a bit.
