I did it.  I couldn't see a point in continiously taking and releasing
the dcache lock, since it just increased complexity and expire is not
a performance-critical path (ie, it happens rarely).
I kept the dget/put out caution and ignorance, but they're clearly
problematic.  I'm happy to drop them if holding dcache_lock is enough
to keep the tree stable while I traverse it.

The dentry it returns is always an autofs4 dentry, and autofs4 always
keeps a refcount on its dentries like ramfs (because like ramfs,
autofs4 exists only in the dcache).

Exactly right.

Say for example you have an autofs4 filesystem mounted on /net.  When you
do a "cd /net/host", all of host's exported NFS filesystems are mounted
on the directory /net/host; obviously the mountpoint /net/host is an
autofs4 directory.
autofs4_expire traverses the directories in its root and finds the ones
which are currently unused and have been idle for some time.  Since all
the filesystems mounted under /net/host are part of the same logical
tree, it examines them as a single unit so they can be umounted as a
single unit.
Note that /net/host may not itself be a mountpoint.  If host doesn't
export / but only, say, /home and /usr/local, then there'll be a tree of
skeleton directories in the autofs4 filesystem to create the paths
up to the mountpoints (so there'll be /net/host/{home,usr/local}).
But because everything under /net/host is treated as a single unit, it's
only correct for autofs4_expire to return /net/host, not /net/host/home
or /net/host/usr/local.
The simplifying assumption I make is that there's a single root directory
with a number of sub-directories; each subdirectory is treated as
a single unit.  They general case would be to mark some directories
as being the root of an atomic set, and other directories simply being
structural, but the need has never come up (and it can be worked around by
having nested autofs filesystems).
