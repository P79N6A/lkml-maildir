I can't say I agree with you (I'm running 2.2 kernels over three 
architectures and have absolutely no stability problems, even 
under high loads).  I can understand why you'd want to stick
with tried and true 2.0 series kernels, if these are production
servers... 
But why 2.0.9?  That's an ancient kernel.  Have you tried the latest
2.0 series kernels (I believe 2.0.38 was just released)?
