Just for fun, on a core2duo make allnoconfig make -j8 here are the build time 
differences (on a 1000HZ config) machine:
16ms:
53.68user 4.81system 0:34.27elapsed 170%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
1ms:
56.73user 4.83system 0:36.03elapsed 170%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
5000ms:
52.88user 4.77system 0:32.37elapsed 178%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
For the record, 16ms is what SD v0.43 would choose as the default value on 
this hardware. A load with a much lower natural context switching rate than a 
kernel compile, as you said Nick, would show even greater discrepancy in 
these results.
Fun eh? Note these are not for any comparison with anything else; just to show 
the effect rr_interval changes have on throughput.
