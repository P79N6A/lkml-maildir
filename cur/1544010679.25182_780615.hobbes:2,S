We use this nominated cpu in wake_idle() in sched_fair.c

The first_cpu in the group_leader's mask.  The nomination is a cpu
number.

You are correct.  But if we are running find_busiest_group(), then we
are in load_balance() code on this cpu and exit from this function
should recommend a pull task.  The cpu evaluating the load on
group_leader will be the nominated load_balancer cpu for this
group/domain.  Nobody would have pushed task to our group while we are
at this function.  However interrupts and other preemptable corner
cases may change the load with RT tasks etc.  Generally the
computed load on _this_ group (group_leader) will not change.  
What you are pointing out is valid for other group loads like
group_min etc.
