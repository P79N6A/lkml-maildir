It seems to rely on 'current' to classify bios and doesn't do it until the map
function is called, possibly in a different process context, so it won't
always identify the original source of the I/O correctly: people need to take
this into account when designing their group configuration and so this should
be mentioned in the documentation.
I've uploaded it here while we consider ways we might refine the architecture and
interfaces etc.:
