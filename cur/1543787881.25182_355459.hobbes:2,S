mm-try-to-allocate-higher-order-pages-in-rmqueue_bulk patch tries to
allocate more physical contiguous pages for pcp.  This would cause some
extra fragmentation at the higher orders but has the potential benefit
of spreading more uniformly across caches.  I agree though that for this
scheme to work nicely we should have the capability of draining the pcps
so that higher order requests can be serviced whenever possible.
