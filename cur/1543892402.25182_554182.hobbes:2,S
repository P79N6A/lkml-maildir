For some reason, pulling half the kernel's brains out into a separately
maintained userspace seems to make things less reliable.  I always build
in everything I need to boot.
Perhaps this makes me an old-timer.

Well, the code is a little opaque to me, but do_probe() calls msleep(50)
three times.  According to gdb this gets called 27 times -> 4.05
seconds.
