I don't really understand how :(
I want a tick on CLOCK_MONOTONIC to be the same size as a tick on 
gettimeofday() over the life of the system.  I.e. lock step.  The only 
difference is that CLOCK_MONOTONIC can not be set, so, if we use the 
above, wall_to_monotonic must be adjusted when the gettimeofday() 
clock is set (but not when it is "adjusted" by NTP).
asm("rdtsc") is, first of all, only useful on x86 platforms, 
CLOCK_MONOTONIC is in the POSIX clocks and timers code and in all 
platforms.  Second, each platform has an equivalent, best guess, way 
of filling in the time information below the 1/HZ level (and yes, some 
x86 platforms use TSC) already in the gettimeofday() code.  Except 
that the system settime code is platform dependent, this solution is 
platform independent.
