Then as a preliminary design let's plan on this.
- Pass the rentry point as the return address (using the C ABI).
  We may want to load the stack pointer etc so we can act as
  a direct entry point for new code.
- Look at passing a pointer to the mapping of pages that the kexec
  trampoline uses in arg1 of the C ABI.  Largely the format is defacto
  fixed anyway because we need to pass the structure from C to
  assembly.
Using the standard C ABI makes things much it much easier to pick
a calling convention, and to document it.
