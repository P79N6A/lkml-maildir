Are you saying that the current scheme of storing pointers to different
spaces (uts_ns, ipc_ns etc) in nsproxy doesn't buy anything? 
Or are you referring to storage of pointers to resource (name)spaces 
in nsproxy doesn't buy anything?
In either case, doesn't it buy speed and storage space?

Can you elaborate on the relationship between data structures used to store 
those limits to the task_struct? Does task_struct store pointers to those 
objects directly?
