There have been several questions about the latest up-to-date
status of AIO, and whether there is a recently updated AIO
web page out there somewhere.
Well, Adam Litke helped us put together a simple web page 
reflecting the current status of kernel AIO on Linux, available 
tests and benchmarks and a few links to frequently asked for
information.
Its up there at 
http://lse.sf.net/io/aio.html
Feedback and/or additional inputs to help make this more
useful are welcome.
