I'm glad to entertain.  It's a pity you refuse to be educated.  Closed
mind on the topic, perhaps?

That is one of the terms used.  Another, which I pointed out to your
apparent glee, is "aggregation."  Both terms are relevant only because
they were chosen for use in GPL.

Whatever the precedent is, and I'll take your word on it even though
it's more hearsay, it's explicitly covered by that part of the licence
referring to "mere aggregation."

Now, that's more like it.  It sounds somewhat believable, unlike your
previous statements which seemed to say, "you've spoken to numerous
lawyers and they've all said that proprietary modules violate GPL."  I
paraphrased you, and if that's not what you meant then please take the
opportunity to refine your claims.  "Bad idea" is legal speak for, "I'll
fight it for you, but you can lose."  That's a big step away from
"dynamic modules must be governed by GPL."
