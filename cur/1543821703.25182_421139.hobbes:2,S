the update file is the one in microcode_ctl-1.13. CPUID 0x00000f48 can
be found twice in that file, once with product code bits 0x0000005f and
a second time with 0x00000002. Obviously these overlap for CPUs with
product code 1 (testing bit mask 0x00000002), which is what is the case
for the (Paxville) system I saw the ill behavior on.
Thanks, Jan
