There is this annoying bug in isofs in 2.4.19 and 2.4.20
that makes it impossible to read most udf written discs
that have been closed as iso9660. Its not a problem in
2.2.x but dont know when in 2.4 it came about. Dunno
if its fixed in 2.4.21-prewhatever but I didnt see any activity
about it in lkml, so the patch is here:

 				nextino   = ninode->u.isofs_i.i_next_section_ino;
 				iput(ninode);
[The patch is for 2.4.19 but Im quite sure it works
with 2.4.20 too.  The error is because iso9660 level 3 
support for handling files with more than 2 extents is 
badly handled.]
