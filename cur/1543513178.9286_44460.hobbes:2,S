Subject: Repeatable 2.3.x SMP hangs; not IDE related

    I've been getting hard hangs with 2.3.{5,15,18,19,20,22} SMP kernels.
("Hard" == screen freezes, no response to keyboard, mouse, ctl-alt-del,
or magic sysrq, no more cron logs.)
    I do have an IDE disk, but activity on it isn't an issue (contains
Windoze for a game (sorry)).  My real disk is a Seagate ST34572W on an
Adaptec AHA-2940UW (PCI).
    The hanging happens repeatably, usually within 20 minutes of starting X,
and often immediately after starting X (on console).  If I don't start X,
there doesn't seem to be a problem.  Naturally, I haven't done a heck
of lot that way, but I did do some kernel builds with MAKEFLAGS -j3
to get some concurrency, and didn't hang in several hours running.
    This has been worse under 2.3.{18,19}; I also got 2 hangs in a couple
of weeks running 2.3.15 .  2.3.{20,22} are better; 2.3.20 lasted 1:15 hr:min,
2.3.22 about the same.  I tried eliminating a lot from 2.3.18, but it boiled
down to SMP being the killer.
    I have a 2.3.5 SMP kernel built with egcs-1.1.2-14 (Red Hat), and it
seems fine (ran it for many weeks).  2.3.5 built with egcs-1.1.2-18 has hung.
I thought this was a smoking gun, but regressing to egcs-1.1.2-14 did
*not* fix 2.3.18 .  Lately I've been using egcs-1.1.2-24 .
    Other hardware info:
    Tyan S1682-D motherboard
    Dual Pentium II, 266 MHz, S-spec SL28L (core stepping C0)
    64 megs parity RAM
    Adaptec AHA-2940UW	(is this a common element with other people's hanging?)
    Seagate ST34572W
    SCSI drivers are built-in, not modular.
    I have good records of kernel version, .config's, and compiler,
so if there are questions, let me know.
