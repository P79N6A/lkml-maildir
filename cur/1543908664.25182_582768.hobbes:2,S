Indeed. And for example BOINC (Seti@home) have to consider this. Hence they
recalculate each work unit at least three times and then compare between
each. What makes this different from ECC is that the checksum is not calculated
on every memory operations, but at the end of a larger block of operations. Of
course this may mean that an error can propagate for a while, but the total
walltime (including recomputation) is lower. :)
