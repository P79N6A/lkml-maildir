How will you prevent people putting the "real" data under some random
stream, "just because it is a prettier name"? (Yes, I've seen Windows users
exporting everything because they found the folder + hand icon
prettier...).  Short answer: You can't. And if you did, then it would be
(another) hell to go through when you start using streams for "useful
data".

Great. Now you just need to convince everybody and Aunt Tillie to use that
same format.

Doable if you can just go and force a format/stream layout/application
suite on each and every user. Won't happen in Linux (and I'm happy for
that).
