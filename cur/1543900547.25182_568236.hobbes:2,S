I guess I'm (still) confused by the terminology here.  Do you mean that 
it fits into suspend-to-disk as a disk-writing mechanism, or in 
suspend-to-ram as a way of going to sleep?

I think the point is that if kernel A says "I'm suspending" and calls 
the suspend method on all its devices, then kernel B finds that it has 
no powered on devices to work with.  But then couldn't it turn on the 
ones it wants anyway?  And don't you want to suspend them, to make sure 
they're not still DMAing memory while B is trying to shuffle everything 
off to disk?
It does sound pretty cool.
