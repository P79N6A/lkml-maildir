	I have nothing against the change to module_param_array(), and
I even think that it's a good idea. Just doing my job of peer review.

	Yes, I could do my little hack in my corner, but I think it
would be counter productive. I'm sure that compared to adding a check
on strlen, it would be more bloat. But, more importantly, I would make
the code more obscure and unmaintanable.
	But, I think you are missing the point I'm making. We are
striving to make APIs that are simple, efficient and avoid users to
make stupid mistakes. The conversion from MODULE_PARM to module_param
goes exactly in this direction, as it adds more type safety. This is
good, as module_param is probably the most used user/kernel interface.
	I believe that buffer overrun is the number one security
problem in Linux. It seems that it even happens to the best of us. So,
it would seem to me that making the module_param API a bit more bullet
proof with regard to buffer overrun might be a good idea.
	So, I'm not advocating that you build this feature just for
me, but that you make it the standard and force people to use it.
