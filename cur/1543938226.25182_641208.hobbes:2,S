Thanks Dave for your continued efforts on Bluetooth bugs like this.
Marcel, are you going to review/ACK/integrate/push-upstream/whatever
any of these Bluetooth patches?
It hasn't been getting much love from you as of late, you are one of
the listed maintainers, and I don't want to lose any of Dave's
valuable bug fixing work.
Or should I just handle it all directly?
Thanks.
