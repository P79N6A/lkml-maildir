Yeah, that's a good idea.

sched_clock would use the highest rated clock in the system, and if that
becomes unstable it uses jiffies. That could mean using the acpi_pm if
it's the highest rated clock. Some code would have the be added to force
sched_clock to use the tsc. 
I did some hackbench runs using the tsc vs. acpi_pm, and there was only
minimal differences (within the margin of error). It could be different
with other pm timers, but that was the result on mine. I also did some
tests of tsc vs. pit which showed some extensive differences. It added
10 seconds to "hackbench 80" . So I'm not entirely convinced that
acpi_pm is totally inappropriate as a fall back, in the case of
un-synced TSC. 
I wish I had an HPET to test.

get_cycles() isn't implemented on all arches. sched_clock() sometimes
returns jiffies converted to nanosecond depending on the arch (it does
this sometimes on i386 even). Also sched_clock() has the disadvantage of
converting to nanosecond each time it runs, which isn't always ideal.
get_cycles(), if it's implemented, doesn't come with a standard way to
find a) the clock it accesses b) the frequency of the clock. 
So they both have disadvantages over the clocksource interface.

It's case by case. I wouldn't say all jiffies uses could use timeofday
calls, and I wouldn't say they could all use a clocksource. I'd imagine
some could be converted to a clocksource though.
I'd be interested to see any jiffies changes you make.

Your questions are certainly appropriate, and I appreciate the review.
There's not to many other responses so far.
