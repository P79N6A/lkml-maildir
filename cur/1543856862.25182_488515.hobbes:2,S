the only problem are public and exported interfaces and function. For
static code you can use whatever you want. I personally would go with
"ieee1394", because that is the official name for it. Otherwise go with
"firewire" if you wanna separate yourself from the previous stack.
Besides having "fw" for firmware it also is used in terms of firewall
and you don't wanna have that confusion.

Marcel
