Hi Greg,
My only concern, then, is that by the time somebody needs this patch,
the set of sysdev objects will have grown, requiring a big patch
instead of a small one.  I would also argue that even existing sysdev
objects could be rewritten and cleaned up slightly (remove
proliferation of methods) by using the attribute.
If you like, I could try doing that and submit it as part of this patch...
Thanks!
 - Jonathan.
