When an interrupt is delivered, the kernel calls ALL interrupt handlers
registered for that interrupt.  That means all drivers capable of
sharing interrupts should, ideally, have code in their interrupt handler
to exit ASAP if no work is necessary.
	status = RTL_R16(IntrStatus);
	/* exit ASAP if no interrupt conditions (0), or
	 * if the hardware was unplugged (0xFFFF)
	 */
	if ((status == 0) || (status == 0xFFFF))
		return;
