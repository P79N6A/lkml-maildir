It seems that the new module loader *requires* init routines (they were 
optional on the old one) so a lot of modules that are simply helper routines 
and didn't previously have an init now need one.
I fixed this on my 53c700.c library module by adding
no_module_init;
at the end of the file.

This hasn't annoyed me enough that I've looked into it yet.  I suspec the new 
modprobe doesn't know about the in-kernel module names (or to look in 
/etc/modules.conf) yet.
