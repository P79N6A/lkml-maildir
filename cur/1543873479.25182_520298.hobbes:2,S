Subject: [PATCH] change misleading EFI partition support description
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch removes the misleading "Presently only useful on the IA-64
platform" text from the EFI partition Kconfig.
EFI partitions are also used by Apple on their Intel-based machines and
thus you need EFI partition support if you (for example) want to attach
such a machine in target disk mode.
