Here is a set of dbench_load results:
dbench_load:
Kernel     [runs]       Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2559ext3        3       115     65.2    3       24.3    1.47
2559jfs         3       123     61.8    3       19.5    1.58
2559reiser      3       108     69.4    3       13.9    1.37
2559xfs         3       118     63.6    3       22.0    1.49
Note the order correlates with the order of the io_load results.
Once again reiserfs held up kernel compilation the least. Note they all 
accomplished the same work in that time though.
