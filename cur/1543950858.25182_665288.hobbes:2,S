After thinking about it some more, I am not sure if I got this fix quite right. The first two hunks are technically fine and should ultimately go in.  The last hunk is questionable.
Ultimately, I believe the root cause of these reported issues is that cpu_online_map and rd->online can get out of sync.  I fear that while the current patch may fix the hotplug/s2ram case, it potentially breaks the disjoint cpuset topology change case.  I will run a few cpuset tests ASAP to confirm, though I may not have a chance until Monday.
What I probably need is to tie the code that sets/clears cpu_online_map to the root-domain rd->online map somehow.  However, a cursory cscope inspection has failed to reveal the location that this cpu_online_map manipulation occurs.  If anyone knows where cpu_online_map is actually updated, please let me know.  Otherwise, let me think about this some more and get back to you.
In the meantime, cpu_and'ing "task->cpus_allowed & cpu_online_map & rd->online" in the place that Suresh identified should technically fix the hotplug issue without adding more bugs, at the expense of requiring two calls to cpu_and().  The expense should be more or less negligible on mainstream kernels, but may hurt our big-iron (e.g. SGI) brethren.  Hopefully I will come up with a real fix shortly, before it becomes a real issue.
