 Definitely the "going crazy" part is the worst problem I see with 2.6
based kernels (late 2.4 was really better in this corner case).
 I am just now playing with dirty_ratio. Anybody knows what the lower
limit is? "0" seems acceptabel, but does it actually imply "write out
immediatelly"?
 Another problem, the VM parameters are not really well dociÃºmented in
their behaviour and interdependence.
Cheers
