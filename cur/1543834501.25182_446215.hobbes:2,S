The userspace headers are supposed to hold the part of the kernel
definitions that glibc (and mayby the attr package) uses. If they happen
to have their own copy now should not impct the decision what is part of
the userspace interface for the kernel. So actual usage does not decide
what is part of the userspace kernel headers but what definitionas are
definitions the userspace <-> kernel interface.
