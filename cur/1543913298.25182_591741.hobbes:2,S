I pretty much agree with everything said, including 
the part about the sky2 people working hard on it. I
have noticed several bugs fixed recently in the driver
source.
However, it really DOES lock up under load. I even 
tried 2.6.23-rc4 and the absolute latest version of
the
driver and it still locks up, as in
eth1: hw csum failure.

As far as I can tell, this bug has been with the
sky2 driver all the way back to the Beforetime.
Based on it happening with various versions of the
driver back to 2.6.18 that I have tried, plus some
googling on it.
So while I bug reporting point is a good one, it would
be nice to have a reliable driver in the kernel until
the sky2 one is better. The alternative is to use
the vendor driver, which less than optimal.
