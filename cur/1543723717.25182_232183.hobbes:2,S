Yes, thanks.  It does seem that some Radeon cards need the set_var() code in
fbcon_blank, such as Olaf's, while others do okay with the set_var() code
in fbcon_switch()->fbcon_resize(), such as Jurriann's.  As to why, I'm not sure.
Can you try this patch?  It's ugly, but I have no reports of failure yet. It's just
the old code (pre-mm5/pre-bk16) -- do a set_var() code in fbcon_blank() -- 
combined with the new code (mm5 and bk16), as an option to do the set_var()
in fbcon_switch() -- needed by other cards such as rivafb.

Ugly workaround.  When switching from KD_GRAPHICS to KD_TEXT, the 
event is captured at fbcon_blank() allowing fbcon to reinitialize the hardware.
However, some hardware requires the reinitialization to be done immediately,
others require it to be done later.  Others may need it to be done immediately
and later, this is the worst case.
