Yes thanks.

Yes only for the commit block, this is just left-over from stress
testing.

Indeed, it needs a get/put_bh. Thanks!

None of the surrounding members are frequently accessed, surely we
should be ok? But I agree, I only ever used shorts in structs when it
helps the alignment. I've made the change locally.

It is locked down with ide_lock. Other members may be more problematic,
it might not be a silly idea to bit-ify these fields.
