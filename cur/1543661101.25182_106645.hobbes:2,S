2.5 says this:
void end_buffer_io_sync(struct buffer_head *bh, int uptodate)
{
        if (uptodate) {
                set_buffer_uptodate(bh);
        } else {
                /*
                 * This happens, due to failed READA attempts.
                 * buffer_io_error(bh);
                 */
                clear_buffer_uptodate(bh);
        }
        unlock_buffer(bh);
        put_bh(bh);
}
The comment suggests that we need to distinguish read errors from
write errors and I tend to agree. Bear in mind that we're limited to
doing this per inode, so if we start flagging errors for reads, we can
really confuse writers. Perhaps not fatal, but suboptimal certainly.
On the other hand, I haven't been able to find anywhere in 2.4 that's
setting b_end_io to end_io_write_sync that's not also setting b_page,
so I think my original patch is safe in this regard. I suspect 2.5 is
similar.
