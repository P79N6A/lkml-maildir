Does the kernel crash and burn if you pass the filesystem an option it
does not know about on a mount? If not then just have mount pass all
the options it gets to the kernel, the fs weeds out what it likes and 
the full thing gets stored for use in /proc/self/mounts.
That would mean the above would have loop stored for the first and
not for the second and so umount would know what to do with each
case.
(from another bit of this thread) This would also mean that the user
keyword can be stored too.
