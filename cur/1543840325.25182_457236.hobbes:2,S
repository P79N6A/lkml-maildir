Triggering suspend/resume is already generic in the form of the 
/sys/power/state interface. There's been discussion of producing a 
generic battery class lately. There's some trend towards tying suspend 
requests into the input layer, but how appropriate that is may depend on 
the hardware in question. I think most of the pieces are in place to 
provide an interface that isn't tied to looking like APM, and there's 
certainly one or two moderately compelling reasons to avoid the APM 
emulation limitations.
