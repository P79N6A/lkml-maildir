i'm currently working on similar problems for my diploma thesis.
i haven't looked at your code but i guess it'll get a little bit
more complicated...
i'm using resource containers as resource principal for accounting
of arbitrary resources (right now the code supports cpu usage
and an estimate of energy consumed by the cpu -- calculated
from the processors performance counters)
user can set arbitrary limits for resource usage of processes,
process groups, entire machine, you name it...
a friend of mine is working on messuring/estimating/controlling
cpu temperature based on this system as a semester thesis.
there are still a lot of rough edges everywhere but i hope
i can do some cleanup and be able to do a real release of the code
after my thesis is done (will happen early next year)
if there is interest, i can point to some code, but there's
no real doku yet...
