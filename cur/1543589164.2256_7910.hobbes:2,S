Not quite Linus - dump/restore are nice tools to create for example
automatic over network installation servers, i.e. efficient system
images
or such. tar/cpio and friends don't deal properly with
a. holes inside of files.
b. hardlinks between files.
Really they are not useless. However I wouldn't recommend them
for backup practicies as well.
Please see for example:

Well yes, if you understand german...
