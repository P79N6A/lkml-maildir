You must not have understood the post you were replying to.  POSIX real
time signal queues are inferior to completion ports in many ways.
* As far as I know, there is no way to allocate a POSIX real time signal
number in a thread safe manner.  There is no equivalent to the socket()
system call--one must just pick a number and hope that no other thread
in the same process just picked the same number.
* Chuck Lever informs me that the signal queue might overflow, leading
to lost completion notifications.  There is no reasonable way for an
application to recover from such a condition.
* POSIX aio lacks a mechanism to request read polls.  With completion
ports, one may request an asynchronous read of 0 bytes--the completion
is delivered when there is data to be read.  Implementations of POSIX
aio cause an aio_read() of 0 bytes to complete immediately, a useless
semantic.  
* POSIX aio lacks asynchronous versions of writev() and sendfile(). 
(Though the lack of an aio_writev() is made less important by TCP_CORK.)[unhandled content-type:application/x-pkcs7-signature]
