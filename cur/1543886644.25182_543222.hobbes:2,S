Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Fix stop_machine_run problem with naughty real time process
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
I wrote patches which fixes the problem regarding stop_machine_run() and
cpu hotplug.
stop_machine_run() can't accomplish its work if there is a real time process
on the CPU on which "kstopmachine" kernel thread is running. For more details,
please refer to the following thread:
  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/7/41
TEST RESULT:
I did the following test on my ia64 box. It works fine:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# cat loop.sh
while true ; do
	:
done
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# cat test_stop_machine_run_with_rt_proc.sh
#!/bin/sh
taskset 0x2 chrt -f 98 ./loop.sh &
PID=${!}
echo 0 >/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
kill ${PID}
echo 1 >/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To do the test, just issue the following command.
# ./test_stop_machine_run_with_rt_proc.sh
# 
TODO list
=========
Some more works are needed. See the TODO list.
 - If there is a SCHED_FIFO process having max priority, stop_machine_run doesn't
   work because kstopmachine doesn't be scheduled.
     -> I'm trying to fix this problem, see the followings:
        
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/8/620
        I would submit RFC patches in 1 weeks.
 - On CPU hot removal, if that RT process is migrated to the CPU on which
   stop_machine_run() is running, stop_machine_run can't continue to run.
     -> I'm trying to fix this problem.
 - Other `stop_machine_run() with FIFO` problem might exist.
     -> I've not research other subsystem using stop_machine_run yet.
# FYI, I'll be offline for 2 days.
Thanks,
Satoru

Fix stop_machine_run() problem with naughty real time process
stop_machine_run() does its work on "kstopmachine" thread having max priority.
However that thread get such priority after woken up. Therefore, in the
following case ...
  - "kstopmachine" try to run on CPU1
  - There is a real time process which doesn't relinquish CPU time voluntary on CPU1
... "kstopmachine" can't start to run and the CPU on which stop_machine_run() is runing
hangs up. To fix this problem, call sched_setscheduler() before waking up that thread.
