This is about the /proc/self/mounts format:
Why does it contain stuff like "/dev/root" or "/dev/sda3" or
"/dev/myblockdevice"? Does anyone __really__ care about it? I doubt
that. What I have here (with 2.4) is:
olh@melon:~> cat /proc/mounts
rootfs / rootfs rw 0 0
/dev/root / ext3 rw 0 0
proc /proc proc rw 0 0
devpts /dev/pts devpts rw 0 0
/dev/vg_melon/abuild /abuild ext3 rw 0 0
/dev/vg_melon/data1 /data1 ext3 rw 0 0
/dev/vg_melon/data2 /data2 ext3 rw 0 0
shmfs /dev/shm shm rw 0 0
automount(pid937) /suse autofs rw 0 0
wotan:/real-home/jplack /suse/jplack nfs rw,nosuid,v3,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,intr,tcp,nolock,addr=wotan 0 0
wotan:/real-home/olh /suse/olh nfs rw,nosuid,v3,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,intr,tcp,nolock,addr=wotan 0 0
Now, thats just fine and it was always been that way.
What if I chroot into /foo, proc is mounted on /foo/proc,
and run fsck /dev/sda3 in that chroot? 
That silly app looks for /etc/mtab (oh my...) and start the work.
Fine. Now, /dev/root is in reality /dev/sda3. Bad for me.
the whole thing would work as expected of /proc/self/mounts would have
a sane format:
olh@melon:~> cat /proc/mounts
0:0 / rootfs rw 0 0
8:3 / ext3 rw 0 0
proc /proc proc rw 0 0
devpts /dev/pts devpts rw 0 0
58:0 /abuild ext3 rw 0 0
58:1 /data1 ext3 rw 0 0
58:2 /data2 ext3 rw 0 0
shmfs /dev/shm shm rw 0 0
automount(pid937) /suse autofs rw 0 0
wotan:/real-home/jplack /suse/jplack nfs rw,nosuid,v3,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,intr,tcp,nolock,addr=wotan 0 0
wotan:/real-home/olh /suse/olh nfs rw,nosuid,v3,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,intr,tcp,nolock,addr=wotan 0 0
Now fsck could look for /dev/sda3, realize that it is a block
device node and look for that in the kernel mount table.
If it is mounted, abort with a nice and meaningful error message.
So my question is: why was this strange format invented in the first place?
And: will 2.7 get a sane /proc/self/mounts format for block devices?
