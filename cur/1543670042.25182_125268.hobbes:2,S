I'm not sure that this addresses the core problem that I'm trying to
deal with.  The problem is that machines with certain configurations
(large number of CPUs, Nodes, or a bunch of SCSI and disks) display far
too many messages to the console, resulting in the log buffer being
overflowed.  The method that I'm proposing simply allows you to decide
what gets logged when a printk() happens, depending on the message's
priority and which subsystem it originated from.
