Actually, looking at vm_enough_memory in mm/mmap.c in 2.4, which seems to
be the only user of sysctl_overcommit_memory, it is just used directly in
an if clause:
	if (sysctl_overcommit_memory)
		return 1;
		
This means any value different from 0 will turn overcommit on, no matter
whether positive or negative value.
Documentation bug, I would say.
