effect) - think what happens if you've got new allocations after the UID

	Umm... I don't think that it will help anything.
How about the following:
	* dquot_{alloc,free}_block() _never_ blocks.
	* we have 3 inlined helper functions - alloc_block(), free_block() and
change_xid(). They get exclusion (BKL, spinlock, whatever) and update both
quota and i_blocks.
Consequences:
	* quota for filesystems without ->i_blocks is history. It doesn't
work anyway - quota for minixfs is so easy to screw that it's not even
funny.
	* we can't print any messages from the dquot_{alloc,free}_block().
Let the helper thread do it - we would just add a request to queue and let
it pick the thing. BTW, use of global buffer for creating the messages is
extremely bad idea - TTY output can block and you've got no protection
around print_warning().
	* we have to be careful in {read,write}_dquot(). Frankly, I would
prefer to use the pagecache for quota file rather than messing with
->read() and ->write(). Then we can get an exclusion between updating
dquot and copying it to/from page without blocking. Incidentially, we kill
the set_fs() crap that way.
BTW, changing ->dq_op looks nasty - AFAICS you can easily oops on
access to the methods, since the thing may become NULL between the check
and dereferencing.
