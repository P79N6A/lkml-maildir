No, you are still not getting it.  The problem is that the socket
needs to be locked for the _whole_ of the garbage collection.  This is
because the gc is done in two phases, in the first phase sockets which
are installed into file descriptors are collected as a "root set",
then the set is expanded by iterating over everything it's in there
and that's later added.  If a socket moves from in-flight to installed
_during_ the gc, then it can miss being collected.  So the socket must
be locked for the duration of _both_ phases.

It's doing trylocks and releasing all those locks within the same spin
locked region, how the f**k can that deadlock?
The only problem I've experienced with this patch (other than being
ugly) is that the multitude of locks it acquires makes the lockdep
code give up.  But I think we can live with that.
