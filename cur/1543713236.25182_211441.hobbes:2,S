Actually, it should "require" SCSI, but the kernel configuration logic
does not support that.

Indeed.  "select" is very useful for enabling options that cannot otherwise
be enabled.  However, it gets mis-applied in cases like this to address the
"stupid user" problem. (see above re: missing "require")  In fact, the
only place I can forgive the use of select on user selectable options in
within the input layer options -- select is used to force a valid usable
configuration instead of letting someone compile a kernel without any
keyboard support, BUT, it's still user tunable if "embedded" is enabled.
