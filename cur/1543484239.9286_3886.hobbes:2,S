I've got a very slow connection when using ISDN and VJ. I'm not sure if the
VJ implementation used is the normal PPP one, or specifically ISDN, so can't
really help there... Is there anything I can do to debug/trace/whatever
the problem I've got? I'm not sure what the other end is though, although I
can probably find out.
