You're introducing a custom API, which is open-coded repeatedly throughout 
your module.
All linked lists (at least, new ones) must use the standard kernel list
API.

Most of these uses appear to be slow path or nested inside other locks, 
while overall, performance is likely to be dominated by your string 
matching and permission checking.  Use of mb(), which is typically 
considered less understandable, in this case does not appear to be 
justified vs. normal locking, and you also need to use the standard list 
API.  If performance really is an issue, then consider RCU.
