Andi shot that down when I brought it up a while ago, as it does show 
up in profiles for networking and other code paths.  His argument is that 
the loss of memory is excessive.  Personally, I think the benefits of a 
64 byte struct page on x86-64 outweigh the memory loss, as it means page 
index to address translations are a simple shift.
