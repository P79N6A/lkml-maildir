I think it's a bug with 3c59x.c or the PCI resource allocation code in
2.4 kernels, since my 3CCFE575CT 10/100 CardBus adapter works fine with
2.5 kernels, but when running on vanilla 2.4.20, I get a
FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF MAC address.
Curiously, instead of using 2.4.20 built-in yenta socket, cs and 3c59x.c
driver, if I revert to running SourceForge's pcmcia-cs, the card works
flawlessly. Also, it seems that Alan Cox patches for 2.4 (part of which
are included in Red Hat's kernels) solve the problem with my card.
