Subject: 3ware: no cards found in 2.2.19, cards found in 2.4.x

I have a quad xeon 2GB system running Oracle which I am reverting to 
2.2.x because of 2.4.x's less than desirable VM performance (causing a 
2x Oracle slowdown, reported about a month ago on linux-kernel).  I 
foolishly put a 3ware card in at the same time as I "upgraded" the box 
to 2.4.4, so now I am in the undesirable position of needing to go back 
to 2.2.19, but that kernel cannot find the card.  I get the following 
message during boot:
3w-xxxx: tw_find_cards(): No cards found
/lib/moduless/2.2.19-2GB-SMP/scsi/3w-xxxx.o: init_module: Device or 
resource busy
I have tried compiling the 3ware driver version 1.02.00.{004,006,007} 
all with the same result.  Has anyone managed to use a Suse 2.2.19 
kernel with 3ware cards with any success?  The 1.02.00.004 driver is 
from the stock 2.2.19 kernel, the .006 driver is from 3ware's website, 
and the .007 driver is from 2.2.20pre9.
Any hints appreciated,
