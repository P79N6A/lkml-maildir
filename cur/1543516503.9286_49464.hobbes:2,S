Hi Bram,
	The crashing is worrying; it's almost something in netfilter,
being the new kid on the block.  ip-in-ip tunnelling could easily
screw up my conntrack code, which stores the connection pointer in the
skb; once the skb is tunnelled of course, this pointer is
wrong... Hmm...

	This debugging message is the result of an ipip tunnel it
seems; the *same* skb has gone through PRE_ROUTING, LOCAL_IN, then
gets tunnelled through FORWARD and POST_ROUTING.  The code which
checks where a packet has gone doesn't like this.  Does this fix it?
