That's the very point John was trying to make. A leased line in the
classic sense (E1/T1/ISDN) _is_ guranteed bandwith. You get 64k, 128k,
1920k, 1984k 2048k [1] guranteed, fixed bandwith synched with a master
clock.
And: bandwidth on a leased line != IP bandwidth. And with DSL lines
(which are either HDLC over copper (e.g. Lucent HST-DST) or simply
ATM-25 over copper (Cisco 14xx / Lucent Cellpipes) you can even get
both.
So your "wonderful world of ATM traffic management" is only correct
for some flavours of DSL lines.

Let's kill this thread. :-)
[1] 1920k = 1 slot for network management,
            1 slot for connection management, 
            30 channels data
    1984k = 1 slot for connection management,
            31 channels data (G.704)
    2048k = 32 channels data (G.703)
    A least in Germany, a "2 MBit leased line" can come in any of
    these flavours.
