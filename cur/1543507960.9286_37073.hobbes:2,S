No, you still misunderstand. A driver is a driver, a module is a module.
Some drivers happen to be modules and most modules happen to be drivers.
But they're _different concepts_. A driver can also be several modules or
a module can contain several drivers. Things can be modules that aren't
drivers - for instance, I once wrote a module that was a filesystem
image.
And I still maintain that simplified register functions are needed at the
top level of proc. It's a mess.
