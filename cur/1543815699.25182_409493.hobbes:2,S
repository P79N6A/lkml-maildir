I never included the ucb1x00 audio patch into mainline because it
depended on some obsolete SA11x0 OSS audio support, and I haven't had
time to:
(a) finish my SA11x0 ALSA audio support (the stuff which is in mainline
    is under the guise of being generic, but is actually completely ipaq
    specific.)
(b) convert the ucb1x00 stuff to use this generic ALSA support.
Plus there's issues surrounding where it should live (as ever).  It
would be stretched between drivers/mfd and sound/arm and would be very
ARM specific.
