there has been alot of work in this area and sched.c in -BK is much
different from 2.6.8.1's sched.c. In particular there's no
wake_up_forked_process() but wake_up_new_task().
more importantly, the whole bootstrapping of a new task has been
reworked and the set_cpus_allowed() race should not exist in -BK
anymore. Could you double-check to make sure?
