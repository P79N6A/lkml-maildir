In that case, this could be a hardware issue. Note that he seems
to be comparing an x86 PC against SGI MIPS, Sun SPARC, and Compaq
Alpha hardware.
His data set is most likely huge. It's DNA data.
The x86 box likely has small caches, a fast core, and a slow bus.
So most of the time the CPU will be stalled waiting for a memory
operation.
Maybe there are performance monitor registers that could be used
to determine if this is the case.
(Not that the app design is sane though.)
