Yes, this can happen.   But as described this really is a usage problem.  I would
expect if your uid is in use in multiple places you will have accesses to all of
those places.  Part of this won't be clear until we sort out the process id
namespace though.

Hard to find and maintain problems I agree should be avoided.  There are only two
ways I can see coping with the weird interactions that might occur.
1) Assert weird interactions will never happen, don't worry about it,
   and stomp on any place where they can occur.  (A fully isolated container approach).
2) Assume weird interactions happen and write the code so that it simply
   works if those interactions happen, because for each namespace you have
   made certain the code works regardless of which namespace the objects are
   in.
The second case is slightly harder.  But as far as I can tell it is more robust
and allows for much better incremental development.
