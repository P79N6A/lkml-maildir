The BIOS will do this at boot time if it detects that the checksum bytes in the
CMOS are incorrect.  That's probably what happened - somehow, one or more bytes
in your CMOS got altered, and during the reboot the BIOS detected this and reset
all CMOS bytes.
The CMOS can be programmed using I/O ports 70h and 71h.  Just a couple of bad
I/O operations to those ports, and your CMOS is toast.
