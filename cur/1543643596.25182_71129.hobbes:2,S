good idea, I didn't though about this one since I only heard the nmi to
lockup hard boxes after hours of load, never to generate any
malfunction, but certainly the nmi handling isn't probably one of the
most exercised hardware paths in the cpus, so it's a good idea to
reproduce with it turned off (OTOH I guess you probably turned it on
explicitly only after you got these troubles, in order to debug them).
