The problem is that shm segments are like temporary files in a lot of
way.  You can't do open/unlink pass the name of a tmp file to another
program either -- so why should you be able to do it with shm segments?
To do open/unlink with multiple programs, you need some way to pass a
file descriptor around.
Besides, the creat/remove technique _still_ leaks from time to time.  I
have seen it -- more and more shm segments being added because a program
crashed between the create and the remove.

I propose we wait and see what else breaks.
I would really like to see programs motivated to use a file descriptor
passing method for X.  Currently these things can go wrong with X SHM:
    - The X connection is local, so you create a SHM segment.  But the
      server is remote via a local proxy (an increasingly common
      arrangement), so the SHM fails.  Some programs fall over at this
      point, but they can be fixed to fall back.
    - Same scenario but the server finds a SHM segment on it's system
      with the id you passed.  Very bad: you think it succeeded, but the
      wrong images appear.  It can even be a security hole.
    - Same again but you're reading images from X.  E.g. to read font
      bitmaps.  Very bad: you just trashed another applications shm
      segment.
    - Segments tend to get leaked because programs sometimes crash
      before IPC_RMID.  On some systems, the total space is limited too,
      so you can't afford to have lots of them.  Maybe this happens less
      with Linux.  Typical fix: a script to delete bogus shms is run at
      the start of the application.  Result: application occasionally
      breaks other applications or instances of itself.
These are typical, but easily fixed application problems:
    - The server is local but on a different IP to your standard
      address.  You neglect to check all alias addresses so you don't
      use SHM even though you probably should.
    - You check for SHM extension, find it, try SHM and it fails.  You
      crash.  Yes I've seen this.
All the mess I can think of, including the "maps wrong SHM segment"
problem are all fixed nicely by using fd passing over a unix socket.
That, IMO, is the friendly way to establish a shm area with the X
server.
