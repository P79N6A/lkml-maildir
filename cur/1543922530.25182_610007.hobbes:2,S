Since gcc is required to build the systemtap probes on the development
marchine, I don't see why it would be much harder to also require prople
to install drawf ? Or maybe the "crash" tool ?
I guess you must already need to extract the symbols for your kprobes.
Do you use kallsyms for this ? The way I see it, you could maybe extract
kallsyms symbols corresponding to the markers data structures quite
easily.
I would rather prefer not to implement superfluous built-time data
extraction in the kernel build system just to make userspace simpler. If
we can leverage what currently exists, that would be better.
