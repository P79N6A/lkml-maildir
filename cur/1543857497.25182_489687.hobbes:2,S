First I was thinking about defining 2 constats, but maybe the better thing
to do would be to
1) rename simple_fill_super to __simple_fill_super
2) #define simple_fill_super_foo(...) to __siple_fill_super(....., 0)
3) #define simple_fill_super_bar(...) to __siple_fill_super(....., 1)
(Or equivalent thing using inline functions.)
 
I can't really think of any good name for #define'd flag.
Beware, I'm pretty much just thinking out loud.. :)

Oh, sorry, that wasn't your code. You're right about it not being the the
right thing to fix in your patch.
Actually, it looks like another problem created by line-wrapping.
