Ah, it took me a few seconds to reconstruct what principle
you are referring to.
I am used to seeing "Dirichlet Principle" in a context where
one wants to solve a boundary value problem for certain elliptic
partial differential equations. (Then the principle states,
roughly, that the unique solution is found by minimizing
some integral.)
You invoke what I am used to call the pigeonhole principle.
