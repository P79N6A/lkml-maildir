I am shy about making too many changes until I get 2.3.32-pre4 boot fine
on this machine because otherwise I will be making a large completely
untested patch which I can't send to Linus (without risking to "have my
legs broken and patch reverted" as someone said on one of the lists).
So, let's fix this hang on Proliant/1600 first and then "go wild" changing
everything left, right and center :)
