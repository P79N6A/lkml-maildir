I think I've gone through every possible value here from asound.state to 
each setting in KDE itself.  Still, the only sound that works is the one 
coming from line-out, without the port replicator, no sound exists 
whatsoever.  Both of the below controls are set to false in asound.state 
and cooresponding KDE settings in kmix.
I think the concern becomes though, regardless of what kde was doing after 
the fact, this condition didn't exits in <= 2.6.10 when no other 
applications where changed around it.
