Usually within 15 days of being up, this machine never hits 100mb used. 
Since going to 2.2.1, I have noticed a TON of memory being used.  I'm also
using 2.2.1 at work on a machine with 128mb of ram.  I shut down all
programs (went to single user mode), shut down all modules and all file
systems except for /usr, and turned off swap.  Ran free and it had about 85mb
of ram used.  PS showed only 5 processes running.  init, kswapd, kflushd, my
shell and ps.  Last time I checked, these procs don't use that much memory.
