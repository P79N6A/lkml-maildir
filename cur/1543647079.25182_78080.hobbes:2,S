cool.  I didn't realize there were any mmu-full Coldfire chips
in progress.  nice!

I have some test stuff I use when bringing up new arches with
uClibc that can tell you if you are getting into user space
correctly.  But before messing with shared libraries, I _highly_
recommend you start with a simple staticly linked "hello world"
app for /sbin/init.  Only when that is working properly should
you begin messing with shared libs.
