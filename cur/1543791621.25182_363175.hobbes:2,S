Good observation and suggestion from Manfred.

Yuk!
page ffff810008005550 flags 4000005500009090, but the rest is okay.
page ffff81000800aaa0 count 00900055, but the rest is okay (including
                                      mapcount, the int above count).
Even the page addresses seem related.
You seem to be infected with 55s and 90s,
nothing to do with PG_slab|PG_dirty; but I don't know what it means.
