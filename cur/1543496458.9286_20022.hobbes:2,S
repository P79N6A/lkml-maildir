Welsh's bigphysarea is less intellegent, not more, but you might look at:
http://web.mountain.net/~tleete/bigphysarea-config-2.2.9-patch.gz
which applies fairly clean to any 2.2.x or
http://web.mountain.net/~tleete/bigphysarea-config-2.3.3.gz
It works by grabbing memory before the vm subsystem starts, and using its
own private allocators. No swapping involved, relieves vm of a lot of
incipient thrashing.
