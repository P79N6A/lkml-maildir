The original idea was to round it up to the next power of two 
before shifting. But I can see that it will break when the number
of online cores differs from the max number by more than a single power 
of two (e.g. quadcore with only a single CPU booted) 
Ok, if you rename the variable to make it clear
x86_num_cores -> x86_max_cores
