That is true, I plan on submitting it for 2.6.15. The goal was to get
relayfs pushed in first and that did happen for 2.6.14.

There are certainly a lot of ways to get the data out to user space, by
far the bulk of the code is in the monitoring application. blktrace
should be pretty fast though, one of the goals was to make sure it would
be very light weight on the kernel side (which it is) and very fast on
getting the data out (also achieved, relayfs works very well). The
xprobe approach does have certain advantages, the main one being that
you can easily modify it.
