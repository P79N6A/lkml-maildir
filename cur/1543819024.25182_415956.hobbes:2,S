Nice point.  But fortunately, this is for a custom application running on
an embedded device, such that the data that is on another part of the disk
(which btw is an IDE flash) is just the application and the rest of the
OS.  So, although a bad write to the disk will cause much more work, it
wont destroy data that cant be replaced.
