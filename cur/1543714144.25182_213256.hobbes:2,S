Hi Users,
  Iam currently using RedHat 8.0 (Linux-2.4.18-14).
  For some reasons I want to have Linux-2.2.17 also
  on my system.
  I can compile the new kernel but I want to skip the
configuration part. Because Iam new to linux Iam not
much confident of configuration process. Is there any
way to make use of already existing configuration on
Linux-2.4.18? Will this work?
  Please help me!
 Thanks,
ravikumar
