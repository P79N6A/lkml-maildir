Now that 2.6.0-test2 is out, here's my -test1 report.
The only issue I found is with fbcon. I have a Matrox G550, a every now and then
the screen will get garbled on scroll. I can switch to another vc and back to
clear up the mess, but it's pretty useless when trying to track a make bzImage,
as the screen will get messed up again and again and again, no matter
how many times you clear it up. So I finally gave up on fbcon, and now I'm using
the VGA console, leaving all graphical stuff to X. Aside from that, I can play
quake, run MPlayer under XVideo, mozilla, KMail, gcc, wine, star office, no
other problems so far.
Have already upgraded the kernel to 2.6.0-test2, after 24 hrs (this is my main
desktop), everything is fine.
