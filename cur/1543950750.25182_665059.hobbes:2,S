Ah, thanks - I hadn't looked into it, but yes IIUC smack should
definately work.  I'll have to give that a shot.
(A basic selinux policy module to isolate a container was pretty simple,
but providing finer-grained intra-container access seems to take some
changes to the base refpolicy.  I've been waiting a few weeks to find
time to work on that.)
