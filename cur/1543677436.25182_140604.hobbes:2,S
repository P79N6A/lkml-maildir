In the kernel-2.4.21-final drivers/char/keyboard.c file there was a
workaround applied from the AC patches "for hardware which sometimes
send the key release event twice".
Unfortunately this fix causes a bug. If you hold down the left_ctrl and
press the right_ctrl then the left_ctrl release is missed (same story
with the two alt keys).
In X this means that until the left_ctrl is pressed again every key
typed will be as if the left_ctrl is still held down.
Removing the workaround fixes the problem.
Here is the patch to remove the offending code:
