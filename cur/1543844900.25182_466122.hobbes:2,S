Subject: [PATCH 12/28] kbuild: make V=2 tell why a target is rebuild
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/24/143

From: Sam Ravnborg <sam@mars.ravnborg.org>
tell why a a target got build
   enabled by make V=2
      Output (listed in the order they are checked):
         (1) - due to target is PHONY
         (2) - due to target missing
         (3) - due to: file1.h file2.h
         (4) - due to command line change
         (5) - due to missing .cmd file
         (6) - due to target not in $(targets)
(1) We always build PHONY targets
(2) No target, so we better build it
(3) Prerequisite is newer than target
(4) The command line stored in the file named dir/.target.cmd
    differed from actual command line. This happens when compiler
    options changes
(5) No dir/.target.cmd file (used to store command line)
(6) No dir/.target.cmd file and target not listed in $(targets)
    This is a good hint that there is a bug in the kbuild file
This patch is inspired by a patch from: Milton Miller <miltonm@bga.com>
