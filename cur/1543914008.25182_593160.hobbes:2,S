If you get less throughput that is a regression, and it should be 
reported and fixed.
I doubt anybody would have told you otherwise.
Is this bug still present as of 2.6.23-rc6?

As I already explained, there is a long term advantage for all users if 
there is only one driver in the kernel. Therefore all users should 
switch away from obsolete drivers to the replacement drivers, and the 
obsolete driver will be removed at some point in time. The only question 
is how to do it.

The typical user will let his distribution handle this.
And MODULE_ALIAS can also handle this.

That a new driver offers benefits that cause most users to switch isn't 
realistic.
You mention e100 as an example - well, I'm using this driver in my 
computer, but I doubt anything would be worse for me if I'd use the 
obsolete eepro100 driver instead since I'm not using any of the fancy 
e100 features you mentioned as advantages.
There is a long term advantage for all users if there is only one driver 
in the kernel. Therefore all users should switch away from obsolete 
drivers to the replacement drivers, and the obsolete driver will be 
removed at some point in time. The only question is how to do it.

skge and sky2 support distinct hardware.
