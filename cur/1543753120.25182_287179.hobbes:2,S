For reference, I got the 512MB SD card working by adding an mdelay(3) into 
the middle of mmc_send_op_cond(). Anything shorter and it marks the card as 
bad...
http://www.rpsys.net/openzaurus/2.6.11-rc1/mmc_sd-r2.patch
 shows the updated 
SD code that works for me on the Sharp SL-C760 with the mdelay included.

Now I've got both my cards working, I plan to test this code and compare 
soon. The added features look good.

I don't see the problems you mention there. Yes companies may have signed 
agreements with the SD card association and yes, that may possibly mean they 
can't distribute Linux with SD support but that would be *their* problem and 
not a reason against including SD support in the kernel. If they remove any 
SD code from Linux then they would still be able to distribute it. I suspect 
that they would be able to distribute SD code already in the public domain 
anyway.
On the subject of patents, the whole idea behind SD is that there aren't 
patents as for a patent to exist, we'd have some publicly available 
information on how SD works. We're not breaking any copyrights as I nobody 
involved with this code has see any code to copy from.
So in short, I can't see any reason we can't put the code we have into the 
kernel...
