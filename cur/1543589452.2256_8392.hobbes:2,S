I don't have a clue about your problems but certainly the
CONFIG_ALPHA_LARGE_VMALLOC n is not racy while the
CONFIG_ALPHA_LARGE_VMALLOC y is racy.

With CONFIG_ALPHA_LARGE_VMALLOC n the entry is propagated before
starting using the new pgd so it cannot race, there's no special page
fault case for that beacuse you will never get a page fault because of
an unmapped pgd entry in the vmalloc space in first place.
