Maybe 'gorc' can help you. I don't have an url, but it is package 'gorc'
in Debian.
I had little success with a digicam photo of lightgray text on
not-quite-white paper, even after trying to improve things with gimp,
but it might work if you have the oops on screen.
Then again, if you have it on screen, you might as well put it on the
web.
