Not in sys because this is a user space configuration issue.
All of the dumping happens from user space.  The kernel just provides
access to the state of the previous kernel.

Yep.  Although the general answer in the kdump case is that if
the kdump kernel is running you have gotten past all of the driver
problems.

Thanks.  It is good to hear that the code works in the field.

It's a userspace problem...
All of the little usability things are userspace problems.
I won't claim that it is trivial because it is a userspace problem, at the same
time there is no reason to wait for any kernel features to merge etc.  Someone
just has to scratch an itch and go fix it.
