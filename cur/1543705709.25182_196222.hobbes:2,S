pfn_valid() could become quite expensive indeed, and it lies on super-duper
hotpaths.
An alternative which is less conceptually clean but should work in this
case is to mark all vma's which were created by /dev/mem mappings as VM_IO,
and test that in remap_page_range().
The marking of mmap_mem() vma's as VM_IO has been in -mm for four months. 
But I didn't changelog it at the time and I've forgotten why I wrote it
(really).  It's something to do with get_user_pages() against a mapping of
/dev/mem :(
