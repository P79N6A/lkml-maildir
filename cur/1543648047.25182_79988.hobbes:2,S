CONFIG_FBCON_MFB can be deleted, because of this change to the Makefile:
> -obj-$(CONFIG_FBCON_MFB)           += fbcon-mfb.o
>  #      tristate '    Atari interleaved bitplanes (16 planes) support' CONFIG_FBCON_IPLAN2P16
FBCON_IPLAN2P16 can be deleted, since it doesn't exist.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
