This is a user space POSIX API issue. You need to use pthread_setscheduler(),
on a recent glibc. The kernel doesn't handle threads or processes 
differently, so the whole process will not block if one of the
threads does.
[this is all assuming you are using a glibc with NPTL as threading
library, as most Linux distros should have now].
