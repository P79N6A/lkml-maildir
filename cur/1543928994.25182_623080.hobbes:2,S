Yep, it can be expected to be on at all times, especially on production
systems using "flight recorder" tracing to record information in a
circular buffer, then dumping the buffers when some triggers (error
conditions) happens.

The if (!(ptr->flags & SWP_USED) test in swap_next seems to skip the
unused swap_info entries.
Why should we care about get_swap_info_struct always returning a "used"
swap info struct ?
