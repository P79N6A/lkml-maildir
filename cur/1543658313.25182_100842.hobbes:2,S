I think they have a different set of design requirements.  They're both
designed to not only generate hashes, but make the hashes
cryptographically strong (ie, impossible to generate collisions with
less effort than brute force).  They're naturally slower than a simple
hash, so you'd only use them if you need the stronger requirements.
