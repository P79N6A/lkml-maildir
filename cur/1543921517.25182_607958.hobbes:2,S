If you take it that strictly, the in-kernel root_plug LSM could have 
been considered enough reason for reverting...
The interesting question is IMHO still:
Were Greg and Jan the only people to write such LSMs, or how many 
non-abusive users that make sense as modules do really exist after
5 years?
Either you can count such real-world users with your fingers or there's 
a reason why these modules didn't get included.
IOW:
Either the API has proven to not attract enough modular users or we are 
having a to-be-fixed problem with getting the LSMs submitted and 
included.
