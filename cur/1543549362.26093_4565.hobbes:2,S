I wasn't arguing that (really) it's just that it really should have gone in
sooner.  It's all really a moot point I understand, but still.  major
overhauls should get in before the -testX IMHO.  This is the point I think
Cort was going after.   Sure it's been well tested.  But it's a major rewrite
and it has introduced deadlocks (I'm going to have to track one down myself
I think, this weekend) that weren't there.  I'm sure it also fixed some.
