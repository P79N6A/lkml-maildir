Sorry for the late feedback, been busy...
I have to say that I like your version better than mine, and it's
actually less intrusive. Thanks for looking into this.
I have tested this patch with objdir in same dir as src, and in
separate dir.
Everything works as usual.
I would be glad if you push this to Linus.
