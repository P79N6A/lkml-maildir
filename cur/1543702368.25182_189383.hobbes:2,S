Hello,
until kernel version 2.6.1-rc1, the numbersign/tilde key on my Logitech 
USB keyboard used to generate the scancode 0x2b. Under 2.6.1-rc1 and 
newer versions, it generates 0x54, which I suppose to collide with SysRQ 
or something like that (I found some information indicating this in 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0003.2/0721.html
 ). As 
result, the numbersign key causes things like switching from one console 
to another instead of printing a numbersign...
