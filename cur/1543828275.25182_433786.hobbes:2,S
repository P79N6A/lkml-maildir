I was thinking of doing the group of tasks that represent a process's 
threads as a first example as that will be more useful to ordinary users 
as well as demonstrating the technique.

It would be roughly equivalent to a smoothed smoothed estimate of the 
number of runnable tasks in the group.

Yes.  It would be some form of periodical sampling mechanism.  It could 
be done from user space or from a module.
The costs can also be reduced by realizing that it is only necessary to 
do anything at all if the number of tasks in the group is greater than 
the group's cap.  I.e. if a group has a cap of 3000 but only two tasks 
there is no way the group can exceed its cap so that group can be ignored.
