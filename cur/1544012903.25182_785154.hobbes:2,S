On native SATA drives and controllers, the UDMA speed really has no 
effect. At the low level there are just frames going back and forth on 
the link at either 1.5 or 3.0 Gbps so the UDMA speed doesn't really 
control anything. If there is a PATA bridge involved (either internal or 
external to the drive) then this can affect the speed on the PATA bus, 
but that won't be the case here (NCQ support wouldn't be possible in 
that case).

Yes.

3132 is not an AHCI controller but it still supports most or all of the 
same features. (AHCI is not a feature set, it's a particular hardware 
interface.)
