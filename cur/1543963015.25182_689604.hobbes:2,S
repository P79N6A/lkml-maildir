I was talking about fasync.

I am aware of that commit, thank you, but the comment was refering to that it 
came with about zero justification why it was done. For the left over BKL 
regions which are relatively short surely a spinlock would be better than a 
semaphore? So PREEMPT_BKL should have been removed, not !PREEMPT_BKL.
If that was done all these regressions would disappear I bet. That said
of course it is still better to actually fix the lock_kernel()s, but shorter
time just fixing lock_kernel again would be easier.
