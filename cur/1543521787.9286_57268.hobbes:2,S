There can be only one process with a given pid at a time, so there can't
be anything I'd call a race.
Ofcourse there are security implications of handling files in /tmp, but
that is independent of how the filenames are generated and a completely
different story. A program that relies on non-guessable filenames in
/tmp to be secure is severly broken.
