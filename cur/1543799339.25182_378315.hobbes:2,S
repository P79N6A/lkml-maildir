Subject: [patch 2/3] mutex subsystem: add new atomic primitives
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/21/276

While atomic_dec_call_if_negative() and atomic_inc_call_if_nonpositive() 
are certainly really nice and probably a good starting point for some 
consolidation of the different semaphore implementations, they still 
have stricter semantics than necessary for mutex usage.
This patch adds 3 new helpers that allows for greater flexibility in 
their implementation while preserving the mutex semantics:
  atomic_lock_call_if_contended()
  atomic_unlock_call_if_contended()
  atomic_contended_unlock_fixup()
In particular, they can be implemented in terms of a single atomic swap 
which most architectures can do natively without any locking. With this 
the mutex optimizations only have to be done in those atomic helpers 
while everything else may be generic common code.
On i386 and x86_64 those new helpers are simply defined in terms of the 
existing atomic_dec_call_if_negative() and 
atomic_inc_call_if_nonpositive() since they already provide the best 
that can be done.
