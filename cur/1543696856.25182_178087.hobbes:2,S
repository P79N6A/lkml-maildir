By thread pool, do you mean, one thread per socket?, or a work-crew model 
where a specified number of threads handle many sockets?

My definition of "efficient" is a method that is most widely used or 
accepted for writing a robust scalable server. So I guess, "'runs like a bat 
out of hell, and I don't care how long it takes to write'" is close.
Would it be thread pool or epoll? Is it uncommon to mix these two?
Currently, I have a thread-1 calling poll, and dispatching its workload to 
thread-2 and thread-3 in blocking sockets. I dispatch the workload to worker 
threads because some of the operations take considerable time.
Is mixing threads with poll uncommon? Is this a bad design? any comments 
would be appreciated.
