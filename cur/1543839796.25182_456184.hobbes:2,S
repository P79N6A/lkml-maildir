we can talk about it then :)

I do not see it in the patches you have submitted. May be I overlooked.
Can you please point me the code where guarantee is handled.

Yes, IMO, it is cleaner. 
Think of the documentation that explains how to write a controller for
UBC.
With a proper interface it will read something like: One have to call
register_controller(char *name) and on success it returns a unique id
which is the id for the controller.
			Vs
With changing lines in the core code: One have to edit the file
filename.c and add a macro to this of macros with an incremented value
for their controller and add the name of their controller to the array
named controller_names[].
I think the first one is cleaner, what do you think ?
