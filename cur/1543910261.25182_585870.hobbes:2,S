Nope, it is a regression.

This worked in 2.6.22 and does not work in 2.6.23. So something changed. I 
make a separate post about it because it is probably unrelated to smsc.

No; it "just worked". I do not even have setserial command ... installed one 
but this does not support "none"

If I unload 8250 smsc-ircc2 loads just fine.
