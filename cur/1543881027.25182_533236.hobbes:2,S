If by desktop you mean "one and only one interactive user," that's true. 
On a shared machine it's very hard to preserve any semblance of fairness 
when one user gets far more than another, based not on the value of what 
they're doing but the tools they use to to it.

Why is that? There are lots of things which are intrinsically single 
threaded, how are we hurting hurting multi-threaded applications by 
refusing to give them more CPU than an application running on behalf of 
another user? By accounting all threads together we encourage writing an 
application in the most logical way. Threads are a solution, not a goal 
in themselves.
