Probably all true.

I don't know if that would *directly* lead to gcc being smarter. I
think perhaps they probably don't benchmark on code bases that have
much explicit annotation (I'm sure they wouldn't seriously benchmark
any parts of Linux as part of daily development). I think the key is
to continue to use annotations _properly_, and eventually gcc should
go in the right direction if enough code uses it.
And if you have really good examples like it sounds like above, then
I guess that should be reported to gcc?
