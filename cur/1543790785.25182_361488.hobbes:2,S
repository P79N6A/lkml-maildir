One possible solution:
Rather than making the patch a simple diff of the trees, make the patch a cat 
of the individual patches/commits (preferably with descriptions) that got 
applied, in the order they got applied.
This makes the patch bigger, but it also means that bisect can be done with 
vi, simply by truncating the file at the last interesting patch and applying 
the truncated version to a clean tree.  Since patch applies hunks in order 
and sifts out hunks from description already...
Is this a viable option?
