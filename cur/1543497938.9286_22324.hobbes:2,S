I had reported a 100% repeatable lockup on my dual-PII SMP box.  This
occurs with the following kernels:
2.2.7-ac4
2.2.9-ac2
It does _not_ occur under:
2.2.7-ac2
2.2.9 (vanilla)
2.2.9 + Tronds nfsv3 patch + hjl's knfsd 2.2.8-1 patch
I rebuilt 2.2.9-ac2 using gcc-2.7.2.3 instead of my usual egcs-1.1.  Made
no difference..
Hopefully this will at least suggest where the problem lies.  Symptoms
are:
- xdm login locks machine immediately after entering password
- console login works, but starting Midnight Commander and exiting
immediately panics the kernel.  Process was 'mc' - nothing saved to the
log.
- console login + startx = fvwm2 comes up and permits a login.  Start
Midnight commander in an rxvt window.  Quit via F10.  The rxvt window
clears exactly 1/2-way and machine locks solid.
All of these are repeatable at will, though the protracted fsck on next
powerup gets old quickly.  When hung, the machine can be pinged, but
responds to nothing else whatever - including magic sysreq!
Steve
ps. - Under working kernels, the machine is rock stable.  No other
flakiness observed.
