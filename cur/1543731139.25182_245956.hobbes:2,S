Hmm....I cannot answer it fully.
My tiger4 (Itanium x 2) shows aligned_order=0, because it has a mem_map
start with address 0x????????3(I forget now), odd number ;(.
I like a mechine in which all memory are aligned.....

in boottime, it will be better.
I'll going on considering the way to fix nr_mem_map things.
