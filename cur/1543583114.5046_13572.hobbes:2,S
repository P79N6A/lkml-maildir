Works, but it seams a bit flakey. Sometimes I get 0xXX 0x29 and 0xXX 0x28
and sometimes only 0xXX 0x28. The "jog dial" is even more flakey. This
has the third variation of no events at all.

The C1Vx does support as I have now heard in principle no APM, so I
would have to use ACPI. If I want to use ACPI I cannot compile in APM,
else it tries to use APM. A way to switch of the backlights, which
works very reliable, is shuting the notebook. :)

I seams every C1Vx does other things.

"modprobe usb-storage" does dectect the floppy, does detect the memory
stick (prorietary crap) and hangs then forever. (With 2.4.2 and 2.4.2-ac3)

I had this also, the I installed the ALSA driver and no problems again
with it.
