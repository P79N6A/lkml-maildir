Hello,
I am experiencing a problem with both 2.4.0 and 2.4.1. The problem is that
at seemingly random times the console locks up. After the lockup I can no
longer type and the mouse is frozen. As far as I can tell, other systems
services are not affected, i.e. programs continue to run, music is being
played, I/O is fine. It looks like _only_ the console devices are locked
up.
I work under X most of the time, but this has happened on a bare VC once
also. The frequency of occurrence varies from 0 to a few times a day, with
an average about 1 time/day.
When it happens I use my UPS to power the machine down gracefully and then
reboot, however, it is a nuisance. After reboot the system log does not
have anything out of the ordinary in it. I think this might be related to
the other reports of lockups with 2.4.1 (by Ed Tomlinson and Alexander
Zvyagin).
The system specs are the following:
motherboard: ABIT BH6 rev 1.0
	the BH6 is based on Intel's 440BX chipset
	(chipset BIOS updated to the latest available one)
CPU: Pentium II (Deschutes) stepping 02 @ 400MHz
RAM: 256MB SDRAM
HDD: 3 hard drives:
	hda: QUANTUM BIGFOOT TS8.4A, ATA DISK drive	( 8GB)
	hdb: WDC WD205AA, ATA DISK drive		(30GB)
	hdc: WDC AC21200H, ATA DISK drive		( 1GB)
CD-ROM:
	hdd: CR-801NP, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
FDC:
	Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
	FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077
ttyS:
	two serial ports on the motherboard
video:
	Matrox Millenium G200 (8MB SDRAM)
eth:
	Intel EtherExpressPro 10/100 (connected to DSL)
sound:
	Creative SB AWE64 (ISA device)
modem:
	USR3030/2729371324[0]{U.S. Robotics 56K FAX INT}
I also have a Hauppauge bt848-based TV tuner card but the driver for it
is compiled as a module and not loaded or used.
All hard drives use DMA by default but the kernel usually switches to PIO
for the CD-ROM after I start using it.
Any ideas as to the cause for the lockups would be greatly appreciated. I
am also willing to experiment/troubleshoot/test possible solutions, except
that I have no idea where to start from.
Cheers,
--Ivan
