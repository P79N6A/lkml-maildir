Francois,
I did a few tests with the r8169 driver on my x86-64 system:
with DAC enabled (as is default),
the first interrupt is a read interrupt, because the status read from 
IntrStatus is 0x8001, i.e. SYSErr | RxOK.
So, a PCI error did occur, which is strange.
Because of the RxOK bit, rtl8169_rx_interrupt is called. In this routine,
tp->cur_rx is 0
tp->dirty_rx is 0
tp->RxDescArray[entry].status is 0,
which then gives a pkt_size of -4!
The system freezes somewhere in rtl8169_rx_interrupt.
When I do a
if (pkt_size < 0) break;
in rtl8169_rx_interrupt to block the errorneous pkt_size, the system still 
freezes, but AFTER LEAVING the interrupt routine rtl8169_interrupt.
Same, when I introduced a shortcut to get rid of the SYSErr.
For comparison:
When I switch off DAC, then the first interrupts are
1: IntrStatus: 0x0484 (? | TxDescUnavail?), -> tx interrupt
2: IntrStatus: 0x0484, -> tx interrupt
3: IntrStatus: 0x0485, -> rx interrupt
...
Just another thought:
Of course x86-64 has the address-space that enables >4GB RAM, and x86-64 
always supports DAC (as stated in include/asm-x86_64/pci.h), but I have 
currently only 1GB RAM, so, strictly speaking, DAC is not really necessary. 
Strange enough, the latest Realtek driver 2.2 does not even support DAC (only 
the lower 32 bit of the DMA-Addresses are written to the registers).
Could it be that the Realtek driver does not support DAC for a good reason?
Anyway, I will continue searching for the problem...
