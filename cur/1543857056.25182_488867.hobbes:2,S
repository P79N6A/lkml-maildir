I see. Will look at Li Yu's code to lear better what the Simple Driver 
Interface idea is about. Thanks.

That definitely would be a possible solution.
In fact, the patches for the split I sent to you and a few other people 
two weeks ago or so, do exactly this - in some sense "mechanical" split of 
the generic parts laying currently in USB hid, from the USB-specific ones, 
and moving them around (sure, some changes are done, like introducing data 
structures specific to usbhid, etc., but no rocket science yet).
This would be nice to merge, if noone has any major objections, and do 
other development on top of that. 
I am currently trying to set up an account and git tree for this at 
kernel.org ... request sent, waiting for reply :)
Thanks,
