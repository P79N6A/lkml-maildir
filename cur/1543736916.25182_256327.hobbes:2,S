Disabling latency tracing does not seem to work.  To demonstrate:
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_max_latency
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/trace_enabled
	modprobe foo-module (will reliably cause a ~3-600 usec latency in resolve_symbol)
	check /proc/latency_trace, or dmesg, it will be the modprobe latency.
	cat /proc/sys/kernel/trace_enabled, it is still 0
This definitely worked at one point.  Not sure when it broke.
