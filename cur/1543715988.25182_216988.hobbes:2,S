I'm sorry, but the typical user of EMC PowerPath cannot really be 
compared to the typical winmodem user.
If the issue hadn't been a real confusing / usability problem for 
thousands of individual customers, we wouldn't have bothered with the 
workaround.

It is very common practice to simulate the perception of software to 
work around things and provide increased  comfort and compatibility. 
Entire GPL projects like wine, reactos, ndiswrapper (an open-source 
clone of our DriverLoader), and even the linux kernel itself implement 
foreign APIs or many workarounds to make programs or drivers function, 
even believe that they are running in another environment. Do these 
projects "lie" and represent real-world evils by technically pretending 
/ emulating results when they are in fact not the real thing?

The problem goes both ways. Non-standard, unreported and hard to detect 
kernel patches have caused numerous users to report alleged driver bugs 
to us. You wouldn't know how much time and resources these things cost 
us.

Some folks are more ideological than practical, but most people use 
Linux to solve practical needs.
The former are a lot more vocal than the silent majority.

The important part here is making the user aware, which we have clearly 
done.
