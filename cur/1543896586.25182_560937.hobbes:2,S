The argument has been made that the standard C99 types are _optional_,
and anything included from a C library's headers without _explicitly_
being included by the user shouldn't define those types.
Personally, I think that's a load of bollocks. And it certainly doesn't
apply to Linux-specific files like <linux/cdrom.h>, which are perfectly
entitled to use a C standard from last millennium, regardless of
namespace 'pollution' issues. That's why we continue to use the crappy
__u32 types. Can you be more specific about why this is a problem? Don't
we mostly define those crappy types using arch-specific knowledge, as
'int', 'long', etc?

We mostly try to remove this from user-visible parts of exported
headers. Sometimes we just remove it altogether; other bits are stripped
at export time when you run 'make headers_install'. Again, can you be
more specific about the problem?
