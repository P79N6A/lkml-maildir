Subject: [PATCH 5/5] Update Documentation/fb/00-INDEX - add new files, remove entries for deleted ones
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/31/274

An update to Documentation/fb/00-INDEX is long overdue.
This patch adds entries for new files in the directory 
and removes entries for files that no longer exist. The
files are now also sorted alphabetically.
