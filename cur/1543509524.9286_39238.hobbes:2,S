Interesting, since I've had the _same_ problem ever since _I_ upgraded to
samba2. I wonder if it hasn't bothered enough people yet! :)

When posting about six months ago I ran into the same difficulties; the
samba people suggested either bland workarounds or switching to smbfs
(which was a valid suggestion, although not what I was aiming for). This
unsupported nature of smbmount is a pain - I just wonder why everybody
shuns it.
The whole smbmount area is very murky; the switch to new commandline
parameters/format was not really publicized and it made a whole load of
people wonder - see the lists when samba2 was released. The new syntax is
convoluted IMHO, and yet there has been no sign of integration with the
official mount, which does support mounting various filesystem types. Why
is anybody's guess - one cause might be the not-exactly-simple aspect
of samba. Not that this is _samba_'s fault in itself, just that the
consequence is that it's hard to hack on.

Aye, I've done the same tests with the same results always. It doesn't
happen with plain Win95 sharing, at any rate.
