This was in fact it.  I had a couple of private posts, one of which
pointed this out. 
It's obviously not a kernel problem.  There's an entry in inittab to
start update, but it isn't executed, why not I don't know yet.  This
is a stock RH 6.0 distro, so it's not like I hacked the scripts
myself.... 
I'll sort it out.  
Thanks!
