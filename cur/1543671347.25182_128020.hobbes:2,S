Yeah you did but I'm going into a bit more detail, and with a very tight algorithm.  Heck the algo was originally designed based on another compression algorithm, but for a 6502 packer.  I aimed at speed, simplicity, and minimal RAM usage (hint:  it used 4k for the code AND the compressed data on a 6502, 336 bytes for code, and if I turn it into just a straight packer I can go under 200 bytes on the 6502).
Honestly, I just never looked.  I look in my kernel.  But still, the stuff I defined about swapon options, swap-on-ram, and how the compression works (yes, compressed without headers) is all the detail you need about it to go do it AFAIK.  Preplanning should be done there--done meaning workable, not "the absolute best."

We discussed this on the list quite recently, have a look at:
