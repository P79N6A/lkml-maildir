Great idea!
I've been experimenting with a new compat_dev_ioctl() function along
the lines of what I just posted for the blkdev ioctls. For that, it
would be perfect to streamline dev_ioctl further:
* move the dev_load() and locking into dev_ifsioc{,_locked}
* move the copy_to_user step to a single place at the end of dev_ioctl
After that, we could have very simple dev_ioctl and compat_dev_ioctl
functions calling the same dev_ifsioc{,_locked} functions.
