Subject: Bug (and fix?): send_redirects sysctl ignored

Apparently the send_redirects sysctl (/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/send_redirects)
is ignored by the kernel code.  There's a macro, IN_DEV_TX_REDIRECTS, 
apparently designed to be tested by the relevant kernel code, but it's not
referenced anywhere.
(Its partner, IN_DEV_RX_REDIRECTS, is in fact referenced.)
My guess would be to solve this by adding:
	/* Make sure redirects are enabled. */
	if (!IN_DEV_TX_REDIRECTS(skb->dev->ip_ptr))
		return;
to ip_rt_send_redirect() in route.c, but this needs verification by someone
who knows what they're doing.  For my own purposes I've just put a "return"
statement there to turn them off entirely.
(I need this to work around problems with a broken ISDN router.)
As a secondary issue, the Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt file has
apparently become out of date w.r.t. the current implementation.  *shrug*
