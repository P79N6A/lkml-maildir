I tested "plain" 2.4.12 from Linus and it suffer the same problem.
Pressing Fn+Suspend does nothing on my Dell Latitude C600, so I thought
it would not be usefull to test against 2.4.12-ac. Tell me if I am plain
wrong on this, otherwise, I guess my problem is not exactly the same than 
Samuli Suonpaa's.
>From the last thread on this subject, I could narrow down the problem
between 2.4.9 (working) and 2.4.10 (broken), so I did not test against -ac.
I rather tested against 2.4.10-preXX. I hope this is not a problem.
Sumary:
-------
Hardware: Dell Latitude C600
When apm is broken, pressing Fn+Suspend does nothing and launching "apm -s"
returns "apm: Resource temporarily unavailable".
2.4.9 ==> apm works
2.4.10-pre8 ==> apm works
2.4.10-pre10 ==> apm works
2.4.10-pre11 ==> apm works
2.4.10-pre12 ==> apm broken
2.4.10 ==> apm broken
2.4.12 ==> apm broken 
2.4.13 ==> apm broken
The problem appeared in 2.4.10-pre12. I read the Changelog but it is not 
precise enough for me :-), I started to diff between pre11 and pre12 but
I need a sleep now ... I already compiled to much kernels for tonight !
I am ready to test other things if I can help on this issue.
Where could I get patches between pre11 and pre12 in small chunks to start
some experimentation ?
