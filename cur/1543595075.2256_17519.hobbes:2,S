This IS the company that had the "I work 90 hours all the time" club with 
t-shirts and everything back under Jobs in the early 80's.  And far more 
recently, where at least one employee got in trouble for "thinking different' 
with a parody site involving famous serial killers.
The "Proprietary frosting" model is fine for leaf-node projects like games.  
But if the new layer is infrastructure other people are expected to build on 
top of, then what you're really saying is "I want slaves".
