This seems to be a bug in the debugging code. We should remove all the
"owner" debugging code since it looks it can race. We end changing the
onwer field just to avoid UnlockPage to Oops, but changing it we allow the
irq handler to Oops. I don't think doing:
		[..]
		cli();
		page->owner = (int)current;
		UnlockPage(page);
		sti();
		[..]
is a good idea :)
Anyway in clean 2.3.7 ll_rw_block gets called without the big kernel lock
while we should hold it because add_request will refile the buffer and we
can't grab the big kernel lock while we hold the io_request_lock to avoid
deadlocking. I just fixed all these bugs in 2.3.7_andrea1 (and I would
like to know if you can reproduce bad things with it).
Now I'll start deleting the "owner" checking.
