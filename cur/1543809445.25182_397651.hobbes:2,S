There's one chip missing. If memory serves, this board has two hardware
monitoring chips: one Winbond Super-I/O and one LM85-compatible SMBus
chip. You are missing the i2c-amd756 driver in your kernel build
(CONFIG_I2C_AMD756) which prevents you from accessing that second chip.
Additionally, the Winbond Super-I/O chips are better supported by the
newer w83627hf driver than by the w83781d you are using.
So, you should change your kernel configuration to:
CONFIG_I2C_AMD756=y
#CONFIG_SENSORS_W83781D is not set
CONFIG_SENSORS_W83627HF=y
Then you'll probably have much better results - even if the
configuration file might need additional tweaking.

If not software regression, the aging of your hardware might have caused
it, as I mentioned earlier. But you are free to believe in the
hypothesis you prefer, given that we are not currently able to
demonstrate it anyway ;)
