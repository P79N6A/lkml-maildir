Maybe, but after having spent several hours debugging now, I think it was 
worth it: I am almost sure this is not a gcc bug, but a nasty race condition 
involving the semaphore handling bdflush_init. 
I figured out by spilling some printk's around in bdflush_init, which made 
the bug magically disappear, what wasn't what I intended - but which gave me 
a clearer impression of what's going on.
It seems that whyever, the cause for this failure is actually the down(sem) 
call on a not yet up()'ed semaphore, and this is where it starts to get ugly.
