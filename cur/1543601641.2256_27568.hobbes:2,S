Hello,
I am a newbie of linux kernel and studying network kernel source.
when network device driver receives packet and allocates buffer,
what is the default size of allocation?
and is there any reallocation happened when upper layer(ip/tcp) manipulates
buffer which was allocated by device driver?
Thank you.
