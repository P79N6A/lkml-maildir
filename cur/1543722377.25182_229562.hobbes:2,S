If you only care about anonymous memory, how do you think
about expanding the COW mechanism?
  1. make all pages COW in a process space.
  2. force to cause COW fault on the each page.
  3. copy from the page to a new allocated page, and discard the old page.
You may preallocate new pages.
Thank you,
Hirokazu Takahashi.
