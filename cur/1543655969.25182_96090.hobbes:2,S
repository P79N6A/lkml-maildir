Hi,
This sounds more like the bug I have opened:
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110
where if CONFIG_DEVFS_FS = Y and CONFIG_DEVFS_MOUNT = Y, you will get:
VFS: Cannot open root device "hda2" or 03:02
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:02
I worked around it by enabling CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS = Y under the
character devices.
But, a recent update to the bug shows that a patch was posted but nobody
cared.
Personally, I think the patch should be merged.
Mohamed
