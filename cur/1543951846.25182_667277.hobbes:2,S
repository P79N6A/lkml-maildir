No.
hw is proper place to implement autorepeat, and along with some
buffering, it has chance to work. Kernel is not real-time, and X are
definitely not real-time, while autorepeat is real-time operation.
It actually mostly works in ps/2 case. Buffer in hardware means that
pretty big interrupt delays can be tolerated without problems.
