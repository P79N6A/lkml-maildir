I mean if one cpu is doing register_kprobe, which will change other_kp's
flag. Another cpu is running into other_kp's break point, which will
look at the flag, there is a window (between the second cpu looks at the
flag and doing boost) the first cpu can change the flag in the window.
It appears we will lose one probe, but not sure if this is over
thinking.
