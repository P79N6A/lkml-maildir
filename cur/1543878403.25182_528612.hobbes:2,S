It sounded this was specific to Ingo.  I haven't heard anybody else 
complain, and AFAIK Ayaz and Ingo were still going back and forth.

ACK this one.  Need to send this up, but I'm intentionally avoiding work 
as we are having a big Easter bash here in Raleigh.  Silly bunny-related 
traditions that have nothing to do with Jesus take priority ;-)
I have a couple other bug fixes to push, but that will wait until Tuesday.
