Strange. I routinely handle 50,000 interrupts per second.

Erm.. How is this supposed to measure interrupts?

Could you please explain how this has anything to do with interrupts?
I see you looping on the cpu clock for an abitrary count (< 90), and
doing this another abitrary amount (500), and printing some abitrary
manipulation of the last residual.
It's true. I just don't get it. Are you thinking that the kernel's
preemption of your task is an interrupt? Even though the preemption
occurs, sometimes using an interrupt, it is hardly an interrupt.
When you are trying to write stuff to the terminal, if the buffer's
full, you lose, you are preempted (sleep). What you seem to me
measuring is the effect of overloading your output buffer.
Cheers,
