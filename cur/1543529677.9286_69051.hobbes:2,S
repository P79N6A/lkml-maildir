Well, maybe that it is just me, but I can say something, I think
that we should left this code here for whole 2.4.x, as I still sometime
run 2.3.x together with 2.2.x and unless I switch to devfs, I must
have /dev/fb1 pointing to 29,32; but to 29,1 for 2.[34].x. I think
that it is unacceptable.
I think that we should revert all fbcon/fbmem changes that went into
2.3.51 (video= -> fbcon=; change in initialization order (white
square on matroxfb); video4linux (in)compatibility). I received
couple of bugreports on these topics during weekend :-(
                                        Best regards,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
