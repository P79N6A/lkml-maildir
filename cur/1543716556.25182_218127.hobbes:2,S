I know that kernel threads work. My question was more like: "I'd like to know, whether writing my module as kernel thread will make it able to read/write files".

From what I know about kernel (which doesn't say I'm correct!) is:
Using kernel module:
- user space process wants to change some file which is in "snapshoted" dir
- my module catches this request, holds it, creates copy of original file and allows original request to proceed
Using user-space approach  my kernel module must call my user space program which causes context switching (which I think is quite expensive and should be avoid). It surely won't matter on some desktop machine but when you need to do snapshots you need it to do it on large file-server with 10s/100s of active users.
Another counter-example I think is LUFS (Linux Userspace FS) - at least last time I've heard about it it was too slow for serious usage.

Is there any other way how to undestand what kernel DOES except starting hacking it and asking stupid questions like "how can I read file"? :-) I've read 10s papers about kernel design in general and comparison between Linux/Windows NT/HURD/... kernels and taken 2 semesters of "Operating systems" so I got some rought idea how kernel works - now I'm confrontating my idea with reality.

There something surely true in your approach. But this approach leads to micro-kernel solutions - "let's make kernel only as small as possible and all else be user-space". Where is line between "too overloaded" and "too small" let's Linus decide ;-)
