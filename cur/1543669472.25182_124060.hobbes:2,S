This is a nightmare to keep current.

The strings are too variable. The kernel embeds strings into some of
its messages. There must be hints in the output about what should
be translated and what must be left alone.
Like:
<esc>xxxxxxxxDummyfs: Unknown flags for file <lit>myfile
That means that you have to parse and mangle the strings as they
are in the kernel sources: "Dummyfs: Unknown flags for file %s\n"
This is not very difficult, printk() does it already. The beauty of that
would be that "Dummyfs: Unknown flags for file" now strictly speaking
is unnecessary in the kernel image. The mangling tool can replace it
with a number which klogd can replace with the original.
However this means that kernel and 'messages file' need to be kept
in sync, like System.map currently.
Now that is not all. Klogd will not run in some cases and cannot
be assumed to always run in others. Eg klogd itself may oops or the
drive with the messages file may break down, or we might be booting.
You might remove the strings only for KERN_DEBUG and KERN_INFO
strings. That should result in space savings and translation ability.
