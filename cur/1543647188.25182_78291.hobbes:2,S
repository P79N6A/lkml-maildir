A couple of suggestions for the output...
The BitKeeper header is unfortunately less than useful at times -- often 
multiple cset descriptions wind up in the header -- so I would suggest 
exporting the patch with "-hdu" instead of "-du", and then manually 
adding the changeset info and description at the top.
Also, diffstat output prepended would be nice too.
