Hi. I use MediaGX with kernel 2.6.19.
cirix.c try to find companion chip (CS5510 and CS5520) with
pci_devPresent().
However, cyrix.c cannot find a companion chip because a list of
pci_devices is not yet initialized when __cpuinit is called.
Therefore, Search functions such as the 2.4 kernel which pci_devices
list is needless is necessary.
How will it be good?
