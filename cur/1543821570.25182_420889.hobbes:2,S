Regrettable, that's not true.

If the (expletive deleted) pm timer is enabled in your .config (it is
enabled by default and shall forever remain enabled for all who don't
know the incantation to make pm timer option appear in acpi menu) it is
used unless specifically overridden, which defeats the original purpose
for ever having a high resolution sched_clock().
