I would prefer to actually see == 0x378 in the code, because the 
hexademical number is what you see everywhere else, such as the BIOS POST 
and /proc/ioports. This also applies to 0x278 and 0x3BC below.

Background info before: Because I burnt my on-board LPT port (applying too 
much volts or milliamps), I bought a dual-slot PCI add-in card. This card 
provides "parport1" and "parport2" at ports at 0xC800 and 0xC00 
(/proc/ioports).
There are a number of problems in your code:
1- testing just for 0x378/0x278/0x3BC is not enough
2- parport0 could be 0xC800 (address may vary) if you do not
   have any onboard LPT ports.
    2=> that is why I think you should not reserver "lp0"/"parport0"
        for 0x378.
All this applies to the other chunks too of course...:
