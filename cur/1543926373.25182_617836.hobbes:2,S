As Haavard had noted.  The "requested" flag is actually serving
as a longterm bit-level lock, which -- assuming well-behaved
callers, and no debug instrumentation -- obviates any need to
grab a spinlock in hot paths.

That's what the gpio_request() call does, although it's using
something isomorphic to a refcount, not an actual refcount.
The key observation here is that we already *have* a bit which
is serving as a per-gpio lock.  It's just never been viewed as
a lock before.  :)

No, we still need to use a spinlock to protect table changes.
The reason for that is briefly:
  - gpio_request()/gpio_free() have so far been optional.  Most
    platforms implement them as NOPs, not all drivers use them.
    (Having gpiolib in place should help change that ...)
  - gpio_direction_input()/gpio_direction_output() implicitly
    request the pins, if they weren't already requested.
  - Those input/output direction-setting calls may be called
    in IRQ contexts, which means (on non-RT kernels) no mutex.
So we're actually in good shape; just take out a bit of code
(or turn it into debugging instrumentation) and I don't think
anyone will complain about the locking any more.
