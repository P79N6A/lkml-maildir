This is the hung_task_timeout message after a couple of cpu-offlines.
This is on 2.6.25-rc3.
INFO: task bash:4467 blocked for more than 120 seconds.
"echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs" disables this message.

3 locks held by bash/4467:

So it's not just a not reaping of watchdog thread issue.
I doubt it's due to some locking dependency since we have lockdep checks
in the workqueue code before we flush the cpu_workqueue.
