True.

I am sorry about that, but I have been very busy among other things
changing jobs (which is always a pain and time consuming).

Thanks for this, I will review it and post a patch based on it (with
due accredition of course).

I obviously took too long a breath last time you said this ...
I did not say the I did not "like the idea of me implementing it, as
some people at linuxcare (including Stephen) want to do it differently
themselves".  What I said the first time was that I preferred the
idea of a user mode daemon interacting with the kernel not the kernel
forking and execing a new process for every event.
The fact that I was speaking to one of my coworkers about a "better"
interface encompassing all the current power management implemetations
in the kernel (currently at least 4) is a side issue.  These discussions
have progressed and will be continued at the 2.5 Developers kickoff
this weekend.
It is important when implementing an API (and that is what we are doing)
to try to get it as right and stable as possible because other developers
do not like interfaces changing ...

Politics doesn't enter into it (as far as I am concerned).

This is true ...
Cheers,
Stephen
P.S. Just so you know, I probably won't have acces to my email for a few
days (it is a long way to San Jose).
