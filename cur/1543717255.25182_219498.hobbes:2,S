Yes, so let's discuss it and think about a nice clean solution rather
than hastily merge something that 'seems to work' without considering
the long term consequences of this.

And when we have a clean solution we will have to live with this hack
too.

It's not the code size --- it's the fact we add a strange new semantic
(magic group) without what IMO is sufficient thought and discussion
into a stable kernel series knowing that we will probably *NEVER* be
able to remove this wart once we have a better solution.

Why?  Also, most existing users will be 2.4.x --- why does that not
nee this but 2.6.x _MUST_ had it?

When was this issue properly discussed?  It seems like it's a new
issue that's be hurried out the door without much consultation.
It might be my interpretation, but this also reads to me like "I don't
think it's too ugly, it's my party so tough shit if you don't like it"
