Hi.
I installed the latest kernel from Alan yesterday and now i have 
problems with my system. It hangs every two or three seconds for half 
a second or so. What's that? I didn't change anything on my system 
configuration. I have an IBM Thinkpad 600x with docking station. I am 
using the internal PCMCIA driver compiled into the kernel and 
alsa-5.11 as kernel module for sound.
Regards. Frank.
