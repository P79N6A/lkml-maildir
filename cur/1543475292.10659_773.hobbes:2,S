It worked, it was just telling you that you have to do it differntly if
the compressed image is over 512k. Old versions of loadlin and lilo didn't
support bzImage, which is why it doesn't just do it silently. 
I noticed you dont have many (any?) modules in your config. Perhaps you
could make some things modules?
