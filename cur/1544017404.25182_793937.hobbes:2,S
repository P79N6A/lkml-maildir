Hello,

Eh... I don't know.  Locating stack canary at hard 40byte offset is a
dirty thing to do one way or another.  I kind of like doing it
directly in the linker script as it makes the dirty nature more
obvious and doesn't require hunting down the definition in the first
section.
How about something like the following?
#define CANARY_OFFSET	40
#define CANARY_SIZE	8
DECLARE_PER_CPU(unsigned long, stack_canary);
and in linker script,
PERCPU_VADDR_PREALLOC(0, :percpu, CANARY_OFFSET + CANARY_SIZE)
per_cpu__stack_canary = __per_cpu_start + CANARY_OFFSET;

Where is this used?

If this is gonna go in the generic PERCPU script directly, why just
not add DEFINE_PER_CPU_FIRST() too?
Thanks.
