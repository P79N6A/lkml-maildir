Okey, dokey. Looks reasonable, but I wonder if this part came from v8 and 
wasn't intentional:

Now you're forcing the slow-path on unlock. Maybe it was intentional, 
maybe it wasn't. Did you perhaps mean
	if (atomic_cmpxchg(&lock->count, 1, 0) == 1) {
here? I thought we agreed it was safe, if only because it should be 
equivalent to just having done "mutex_trylock()" instead of a "real" lock 
sequence.
