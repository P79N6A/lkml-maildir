Hi all...
Grepping through the sources or the kernel in search of CONFIG_M686
occurences, there are some places where it looks like that flag is
used as 'Anything bigger than a Pentium'. Now kernel has configs
for PIII, P4, probably PII.
It is the f00f bug handling. Files:
arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:
#ifndef CONFIG_M686 <=================== which also passes if PII, P4...
void __init trap_init_f00f_bug(void)
...
arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:
static void __init init_intel(struct cpuinfo_x86 *c)
{
#ifndef CONFIG_M686 <=================== again
    static int f00f_workaround_enabled = 0;
...
So thats why I asked if we could use a CONFIG_MPENTIUMPRO, and make
CONFIG_M686 a generic flag that is also defined for anything bigger
than a Pentium (that looks like the current usage).
So:
Pentium -> M586
PPro    -> MPENTIUMPRO M686
PII     -> MPENTIUMII  M686
PIII    -> MPENTIUMIII M686
P4      -> MPENTIUM4   M686
