Hello Andrew,
I don't think this is correct.
The boot_command_line should only be used by init code.
Drivers should continue to use saved_command_line.
I don't know why saved_command_line cannot be resolved and
boot_command_line can be.
They are both located in linux/init.h
extern char __initdata boot_command_line[];
extern char *saved_command_line;
And the drivers/sbus/char/openprom.c do include it and I assume
__ASSEMBLY__ is not defined.
Best Regards,
Alon Bar-Lev.
