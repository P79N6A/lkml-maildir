Subject: [LTP] [ANNOUNCE] The Linux Test Project has been Released for APRIL 2008
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/5/1/222

Dear All,
The Linux Test Project test suite has been released for the month of
APRIL 2008. The latest version of the test-suite contains 3000+ tests
for the Linux OS and can be found at
http://ltp.sourceforge.net/.
Latest happenings in LTP can also be found at:
http://ltp.sourceforge.net/wiki/,
http://ltp.sourceforge.net/wikiArchives.php,
 and,
IRC: irc.freenode.org #ltp.
APRIL 2008 Highlights:
* Release of LTP Development RPMs enabling Kernel developers to create
standalone LTP unit test case(s),
* Addition of Initial set of MEMORY CONTROLLER test cases,
* Cleanups for existing CPU CONTROLLER test cases,
* Continuing work for Concurrency fixes,
* Cleanup/Updates to LTP Real Time test cases,
* Cleanup/Updates to LTP SELinux test cases,
* SGI Common Criteria CAPP/LSPP EAL4+ certification test suite Release,
* Release of gcov-kernel patches for Linux 2.6.25,
* A Paper on LTP´s progress has been submitted to OLS 2008 committee.
Note(s) from the Maintainer:
Kerlabs kept the wheel rolling for fixing the concurrency issues. RT
tree cleanup and updates has become very common. Hope this brings good
news to the RT Linux community and users. The SELinux community has kept
their LTP test cases up-to-date. SGI has chosen LTP to release their
common criteria certification testsuite. And as promised earlier, we
brought in the initial set of MEMORY controller tests to LTP with
cleanups for the existing CPU controller test cases. But equally
disappointing to see that new test cases from others in the community
are not flowing into LTP. The maintainer has worked to put forward a
Paper on LTP´s progress in OLS 2008. Hope this will generate enthusiasm
among other members of the community.
I would reiterate my request to engineers across Linux Distros to kindly
consider integrating the enhancements/fixes they might have done to
their local LTP suit to the Global LTP Project.
Our web site also contains other information such as:
- A Linux test tools matrix
- Technical papers
- How To's on Linux testing
- Code coverage analysis tool.
We would encourage the community to post results to
ltp-results@lists.sf.net,
patches, new tests, bugs or comments/questions to ltp-list@lists.sf.net,
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=3382&atid=103382

This patch should solve the problem of RT Linux Compilation Failure on various Architectures. It just avoids the compilation of realtime tests on a non (x86,ppc) arch. Assumption: uname -m doesn't contain 86/ppc on any arch except the x86 and ppc. Signed-Off-By: Chirag <chirag@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

3) Log Message:
Previously I was under the impression that selinux test was not cleaning up properly. I don't believe that to be the case. I must have been mistaken. Here is a patch for the allow_domain_fd_use boolean issue in 5.2, by, Jeff Burke <jburke@redhat.com>
Modified File(s):
ltp/testscripts/test_selinux.sh
4) Log Message:
This patch, which is independent of Jeff's patch, updates the selinux testsuite to run under Fedora 9, and does no harm on Fedora 8. While creating this, I noticed two other things that ultimately need fixing: 
1) The sbin_deprecated.patch adds domain_dyntrans_type() to all the test domains.  If that was truly desired, we should just put it into unconfined_runs_test().  But it shouldn't be necessary - only the test_dyntrans.te and test_dyntrace.te domains should require permissions for dynamic transitions.  I'll let Serge confirm that. 
2) The test scripts are presently relabeling /tmp to test_file_t for the duration of the test.  That's insane - it could break any other running process that tries to access /tmp during the test.  That was not part of our original selinux testsuite and seems to have been introduced when IBM ported it to LTP.  If you are worried about lacking search permission to /tmp in the test domains, then create your own private /test directory or something.  Or just give all test domains permission to search tmp either via unconfined_runs_test() or in test_global.te using the testdomain attribute. Those don't need to be fixed though for this patch to be merged. Also, I noticed some new failures in the tests due to latest Fedora policies giving all domains search permission to all directories.  Not sure if that was intentional - sent a separate note to Dan about that.

5) Log Message:
Ok here is a first small patch to stop relabeling /tmp as Stephen suggested. It should be no more complicated to get rid of the unneeded dyntrans_types, but I messed up somewhere generating the patch and subsequent test bombed.  So I'll just do that next week or whenever this patch hits cvs (for simplicity). Subject: selinux testsuite: don't relabel /tmp. There's no need for the selinux testsuite to relabel /tmp for the duration of the test.  It uses /tmp/selinux anyway.  Just need to be sure to have search perms to tmp_t.

***********
RETURN VALUE
       If  name  is  invalid, -1 is returned, and errno is set to EINVAL. Otherwise, the value returned is the value of the system resource and errno is not changed.  In the case of  options, a positive value is  returned  if  a queried option is available, and -1 if it is not.  In the case of limits, -1 means that  there is no definite limit
***********
Return value of sysconf needs to be checked as well and not only depend on errno value. Have made the changes by looking at the code from 
http://www.comptechdoc.org/os/linux/programming/c/linux_pgcpostest.html.

This turned out to be a test case problem, where it fails to identify the correct backbone network interface to use for the test. But there is an option already provided for the interface to be specified while invoking the test.

The Linux port I run on LTP has a minimal set of system calls. It currently does not implement the sysfs system call so I'd like to disable the tests for this system call - at the moment they will fail to compile because __NR_sysfs is undefined. Is there an idiomatic way of doing this? I can either prevent the test compiling completely somehow in the Makefile (e.g. as modify_ldt does) or make the test compile but return BROK perhaps. Attached is a patch to implement a strategy like this one. By Will Newton <will.newton@gmail.com>

Searching for this issue, I found an old thread in ltp-list discussing broken test-cases (
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=46E5998B.9070903
%40redhat.com), where Jeff Burke raise this problem with f00f failing on systems that have the NX bit. But, according to the flags reported in /proc/cpuinfo, the machines where i'm running this testcase seems not to have this NX bit enabled. On /proc/cpuinfo, we also have this line "f00f_bug: no". Would it be useful to select if this testcase should be executed or not? These machines are running a kernel compiled with processor family "Pentium-Pro" (CONFIG_M686=y), which, in according to the kernel config help, "disables the init-time guard against the f00f bug found in earlier Pentiums". Here i have created a patch that seems to fix the testcase using an inline assembly. By, Edjunior Barbosa Machado <emachado@linux.vnet.ibm.com>.

nptl01 looks to have an operator precedence bug in it that prevents the output being done at appropriate times. With this patch you should get 10 lines of output, one every 10000 loops, rather than 10 lines of output, one for each of the first 10 loops. By, Will Newton <will.newton@gmail.com>.

49) Log Message:
I believe we had written this test to debug the other test with a lower overhead clocksource.  Unfortunately, the tsc is x86 specific, isn't consistent across CPUs on certain systems, and can have it's frequency changed depending on by power states. For all those reasons this test can simply be removed from the LTP.

This patch removes the dependency of existing tty* devices for this test to pass, and also ups the invalid file descriptor value from 400 to 1025 which is used to confirm the EBADF errno. By, Henry Yei <hyei@mvista.com>

56) Log Message:
The float_bessel testcases, as a matter of fact, all float_* testcases seem to fail when multiple instances are run concurrently. The failures occur because file sizes don't match or because the number of bytes read don't match the file size. This can be attributed to the parallel instance reading a file before the write to it (by another instance) has completed. In such situations, either the file size has not been updated in the inode header or the file size has been updated but the file's write operation has not been updated completely. To fix this concurrency problem, my suggestion is to check for an existing instance and wait for it to finish before beginning the current instance. Any other concurrency resolution technique may complicate matters. A message to the console indicating such a decision might be added.
