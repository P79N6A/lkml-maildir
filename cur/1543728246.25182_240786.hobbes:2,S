Okay, this boots and runs here. I suspect if a non-NULL value of
pt_regs can be found that properly initializes things so copy_thread()
doesn't die and/or set up something that crashes on the AP, it can be
plugged in here transparently, the NULL check in copy_thread() removed,
and no core changes will be needed.
If you can advise on how to set up the switch_stack/bspstore/etc. to
this effect so it can be done right away, I'd be much obliged.
