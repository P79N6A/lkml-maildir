glibc does this also?
from /usr/include/libio.h
#define _IO_putc_unlocked(_ch, _fp) \
    (((_fp)->_IO_write_ptr >= (_fp)->_IO_write_end) \
     ? __overflow (_fp, (unsigned char) (_ch)) \
     : (unsigned char) (*(_fp)->_IO_write_ptr++ = (_ch)))
I'm just thinking however that apps compiled with the
above will break with Linus' suggestion of using locks
only after a pthread_create(), as they don't really
call the library in the above case at all.
