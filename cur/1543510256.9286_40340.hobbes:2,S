The program below should (I hope) lock 20M of memory into ram.  When it
first runs, 20M are allocated and in RAM, but after lots of other
programs running (compiles mostly) I *sometimes* find the RSS to be
under 1M.  Othertimes everything works fine.  Checking the amount of
memory locked (VmLck from /proc/#/status) shows 20M, even though the
RSS is under 1M.  I've seen this behavior in several kernels from 2.1.77
to 2.3.10.  What am I doing wrong, or is this a real kernel bug?
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
void usage() {
        cout << "Read the source, young Luke!\n";
}
main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        int size = 20 * 1024 * 1024;
        // allocate the pages
        char *ptr = (char *)malloc(size);
        if (ptr == 0) {
                perror("Error in malloc");
                exit(1);
        }
        // touch every page
        for(int i = 0; i < size; i++)
            ptr[i] = 0;
        // Lock the pages
        int ret = mlock(ptr, size);
        if (ret != 0) {
                perror("Mlock");
                exit(1);
        }
        while (1)
            sleep(1);
}
