That should be easy. Like so many other segments kexec prepares, one
more segment need to be created and required elf note data needs to be
put in this segment. 
Right now we create a PT_NOTE type ELF header for every cpu. Now we need
to create few more notes to pass on the OS release, config variables and
debug data to second kernel.
Should we create a separate note for passing on kernel config info something
like "linuxconfig" and every note will contain CONFIG_VARIABLE=VALUE string?
Probably something similar can be done for appropriate debugging data 
instead of putting all the info in one ELF note. Breaking the required
info into multiple generic notes will help it to be used in other things
also down the line. Just a thought....
Thanks
