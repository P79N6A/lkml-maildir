I get this in dmesg with 2.6.18-git6 :
      a3:<6>Time: acpi_pm clocksource has been installed.
Looks like some printk() somewhere is not adding \n correctly after
outputting a message priority or a message priority too much is
used... I've not investigated where this happens, but just wanted to
report it.
