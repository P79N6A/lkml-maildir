Subject: proposed changes for CDCEther module?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

  a while back, i pointed out that, in trying to use the
usbnet.o module to communicate with my zaurus, the CDCEther
module was getting in the way, and someone (mercifully)
pointed out that i could blacklist that module in 
/etc/hotplug/blacklist.
  i also *think* i remember someone saying that that was
going to be "fixed" in some way with a subsequent release
of the kernel.  can anyone refresh my memory as to what
that fix might have involved?  was this issue with CDCEther
considered a "bug" that needed fixing?  or am i misremembering?
  thanks.
