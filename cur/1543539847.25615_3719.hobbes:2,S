This F00F is GREAT example of how such problem should be resolved.
1. Linux MUST NOT try to protect hardware from itself by default (linux does
not scan executable to find "bad bytes").
2. When bug in hardware is found manufacturer ADMIT that it's indeed his bug
and offer workaround - perhaps developed with linux developers (F00F bugfix
was incorporated in Linux very fast when it was developed by Intel).
And no, you Intel not tried to sue anyone for executing program with this
problematic F0 0F XX XX sequence. Quite on contratary: Intel was happy to
avoid counter-claims for selling broken hardware.
