Why not?  I honestly don't know what x86 does, but I would think that if I 
write a 32-bit value to a memory location, that when I examine that memory 
location, all 32 bits will be in order.

You're talking about byte endian.  I'm talking about bit endian -- the order 
of bits within a byte.  Software cannot know what the bit endian is, but 
external devices that have memory-mapped registers can know.

The CPU shift operation, yes.  I'm talking about shift operations on external 
memory-mapped devices.
