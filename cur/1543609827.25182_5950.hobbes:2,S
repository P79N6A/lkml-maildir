Erm, no....
If this really is the case, then obviously my supplier doesn't know
either, as he's quite definitively stuck two of them on my mobo!
Linux happily detects two XP 1800+ CPUs on boot, but then both SMP
and UP kernels fail in this strange way. If they didn't boot at all, it
would almost be more helpful ;-)
