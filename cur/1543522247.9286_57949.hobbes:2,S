Subject: Linux crypto patch for 2.2 kernels

Due to the (hopefully temporary) disappearance of www.kerneli.org and
ftp.kerneli.org, I have mirrored the most recent 2.2 crypto patch on
http://www.sericyb.com.au/
 with my 2.3 patches.  patch-int-2.2.13.3.bz2
will patch against Linux kernels 2.2.12 to 2.2.14.
Share and enjoy,
