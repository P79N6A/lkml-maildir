Yes, but your security manager is *still* in an infinite loop, and eventually
you *will* come to a grinding halt, as each process gets queued up waiting for
a decision from the security manager.
As an aside, the original posting said it was a restricted subset of Lisp that
didn't include recursion.  Aside from the technical difficulties of detecting
two or more routines that mutually recurse, it's unclear that Lisp without
recursion is at all interesting or useful....
This is sounding more and more like the old adage: "When all you have
is a hammer, everything starts looking like a thumb".
