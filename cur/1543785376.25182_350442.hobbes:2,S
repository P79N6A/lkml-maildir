It appears that a leap second is scheduled.  One of our customers is 
concerened about his application around this.  Could one of you NTP 
wizards help me to understand NTP a bit better.
First, I wonder if we suppressed the leap second insert and time then 
became out of sync by a second, would NTP "creap" the time back in sync 
or would the one second out of sync cause it to quit?
Assuming NTP would do the "creap" thing, is there a way to tell NTP not 
to insert the leap second?
