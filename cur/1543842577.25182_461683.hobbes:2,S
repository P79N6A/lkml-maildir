Memory allocated (and hence charged) by a task belonging to one container
being (re)charged to another container to which task moves. Can be done but at
too high a cost so not worth it most of the time.

For cpu time & I/O bandwidth I disagree. Accounting to a multiplicity of
containers/BC over time shouldn't be costly.
Anyway, lets see how the implementation evolves.
