It _does_ generate page faults.
We do the accessed bit by clearing the "user readable" thing (or
something. I forget the exact details, and I'm too lazy to check it out).  
And a page won't be _really_ readable until it has been marked young.
If you don't mark it young, you'll get infinite page faults.
That's how we do the accessed bit.

NO IT IS NOT.
