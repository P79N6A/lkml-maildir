Well, I'm disappointed again. Some xruns came but no additional data
was put into the dmesage file:

Basically the trace above was there pretty much right after booting. I
mounted a 1394 drive, which is shown, and then started running apps. I
got 3 xruns:
16:42:59.826 XRUN callback (1).
**** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 0.273 msecs
16:43:03.764 XRUN callback (2).
**** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 2.082 msecs
16:43:41.618 XRUN callback (3).
**** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 2.040 msecs
but no additional data in the logs.
So possibly this is an IRQ off latency? Or am I jumping to
conclusions? The trace above, if I understand it, indicates a delay of
nearly 4mS, and again, since I'm trying to run at sub 3mS, that would
seem like a potential problem.
I'm going to completely shut off power management as a test just to
see where that leads.
