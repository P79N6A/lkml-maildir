Where I work we have used the Web Pack (5.1, I believe) for "real work", 
although you can't trust its static timing.  Beyond a certain 
utilization, it completely lies to you, and we can't get it to work 
right, no matter how much we over-constrain a design.  All we can do is 
synthesize and then thoroughly test in real hardware (which isn't hard 
to do when all you're doing is a simple pixel-processing pipeline -- 
either it works, or you get obvious sprinkless all over the monitor 
screen).  If that doesn't work, we get really clever to reduce area, or 
we go to a bigger device.  What can you do with free but closed-source 
software?  :)  Designing for FPGA's is a real pain.  Although the ASIC I 
did was a lot more complex, the process was a lot more straight-forward 
and the tools didn't lie to you.
