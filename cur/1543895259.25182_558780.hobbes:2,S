Currently, these people are "Andrew Morton" and the addresses are
linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org and 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/
 - and this 
part is working.
Although there is room for improvement in this area, the problem in the 
pipeline is really to find developers who know the code in question and 
who are willing to debug bug reports.
There are unmaintained parts of the kernel.
And there are parts of the kernel where the maintainers are developing 
code, reviewing code and handling patches but are not willing or simply 
not capable of looking at bug reports. That's not against these people 
and they might do great work, but then there's simply an additional 
person missing who would be willing to learn the subsystem in question 
and handle bug reports.
All bug handling becomes moot and every request for more information 
from the submitter a waste of time if there's noone available for 
looking deeper into a bug.
