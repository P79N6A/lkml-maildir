Perhaps some MS Windows had troubles with 1.1?
VIA has a history of similar things (e.g. some C3 CPUs).
All 3 chips I have, including that dated 2002, are single
revision "80" so I guess there are absolutely no silicon changes.

On this old EPIA? No :-)
At least unless I have any doubt.
On the other machine (currently) 1.0? Sure, that's why I did it.
Is the "dual buffer reception" involved in receiving video from
a DV camera, using the new driver?
