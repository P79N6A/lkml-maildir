My understanding was that if the operation region is FFixedHW, the
parameters are meaningless (and should be 0). FFixedHW means the OS
knows without ACPI telling it how to switch states. That is, while R40
lists the MSRs for the addresses, that is useless and confusing, because
the OS should a priori know via a driver how to switch, and therefore
isn't looking at those parameters.
