yes - dma_map_single() has this signature:
 static inline dma_addr_t
 dma_map_single(struct device *hwdev, void *ptr, size_t size, int direction)
on x86 dma_mapping_ops.map_single has this signature:
        dma_addr_t      (*map_single)(struct device *hwdev, phys_addr_t ptr,
                                size_t size, int direction);
ia64 and powerpc uses kernel-virt addresses for map_single(). So there's 
material semantic differences between the dma_mapping_ops implementations.

if it's just dma_mapping_ops - then it's those 3 architectures. But 
there's no reason why the various DMA bouncing implementations in other 
architectures couldnt use the common code - for example couldnt 
arch/arm/common/dmabounce.c use the swiotlb too?

well the swiotlb highmem patches are what enable xen (and now powerpc too) 
to make full use of the swiotlb dma bouncing facilities. And that gives a 
common platform for unifying all the rest of the lowlevel DMA mapping APIs 
as well.
Without that, the swiotlb code is limited, life is going on in separate 
islands, with everyone doing their own private variations and hacks. We 
would still probably be nowhere with this had Jeremy not sent the highmem 
patches.
