The bug you ran into is that MODVERSIONS messes up the
'get_module_symbol' function, which is a sort of "optional dependency"
mechanism used by a few modules such as DRI (in this case: DRI needs to
be able to use the facilities of agpgart, but should also work
*without* agpgart present, since many systems have PCI video cards).
MODVERSIONS is ugly and gross for any number of reasons, but the
get_module_symbol problem is quite localized -- AGP/DRI, MTD and maybe
one or two other subsystems.  In any case it has been replaced by a
much better inter-module registration system in 2.4.
