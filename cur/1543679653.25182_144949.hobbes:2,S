Computational complexity; okay.
It's not quadratic; at each munlock(), it's not necessary to do
anything more than:
for each page this mlock()'er (not _all_ mlock()'ers) maps of this thing
	grab some pagewise lock
	if pte_chain allocation succeeded
		add pte_chain
	else
		/* you'll need to put anon pages in swapcache in mlock() */
		unmap the page
	decrement lockcount
	if lockcount vanished
	park it on the LRU
	drop the pagewise lock
Individual mappers whose mappings are not mlock()'d add pte_chains when
faulting the things in just like before.
