Nothing is simple in USB, although 1.1 is alot easier than 2.0 :-)
The logs, unfortunately, don't tell much.  But the short answer is
probably 'don't use USB bandwidth enforcement'.  If the bandwidth
request it is reporting is accurate, the kernel is correctly rejecting
the request.  But, I suspect strongly either the kernel is
miscalculating or the headset is vastly overreporting its needs.
991us in a FS frame would indeed be too much to schedule, but no
headset would ever have cause to use that kind of bandwidth.
