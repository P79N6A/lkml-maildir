Yep - I think we need to drop the spinlock, but by dropping it we need
to check that stuff is still sane after re-acquiring it.

Again, we should drop the spinlock and re-acquire it afterwards.

Well, there does seem to be a race in there in the tty layer.  We
appear to close down the ldisc, and fiddle about with some other
things, and eventually cancel the work queue.
The n_tty close method frees the tty->read_buf, and n_tty_receive_buf()
references said buffer.  If the timing is right, *boom*.
We should cancel the work queue earlier, so we can guarantee that we
won't call the ldisc functions after we've closed them down.
I guess the TTY layer still needs a complete top to bottom overhaul...
