Subject: "make install" error: No module raid5 found for kernel 2.5.56

Any ideas about the following problem?
The following error shows up at the end of "make install" after a
successful make and make modules_install.  I've tried making with raid5
both modular and compiled in and with various combinations of other raid
module options.  Same error each time.  Also tried after a make
mrproper.
This is with stock 2.5.56 on a Redhat 8.0 box with the 0.9.8
module-init-tools
