So basically the idea is that whatever one wants to do it should be done
in the next kernel, even notifications. But this might require some data
from the context of previous kernel, for example destination IP address etc.
So the associated data either needs to be passed to new kernel or it shall
have to be retrieved from permanent storage or something like that.
