>Developer replies that the source code will be provided
>only to paying customers:
Not really.  Developer does make the bizarre statement that "paid 
customers" are entitled to source code, but doesn't say nobody else is. 
And Developer says at the same time he will make source code available to 
the person who requested it.  The problem is that he doesn't actually do 
it, and is never heard from again.
