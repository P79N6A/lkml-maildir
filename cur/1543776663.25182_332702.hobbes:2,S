I don't really understand what's going on with that.  It's not the root
issue for sure, just now after a run of about 15 suspends the mouse
finally capped out. Somehow that made it slightly more reliable? Or it
was just dumb luck that I couldn't reproduce it yesterday, but I managed
to do it once today.
My best guess is that something more needs to be done to priv->dev2 to
make sure it initilizes properly but I don't know what, I'm having some
difficulty understanding the alps driver.
But it could be something independent of resume, I have a gentoo user
with another inspiron 8500 who says even with 2.6.12, the dualpoint
stick doesn't initilize a lot of the time even on boot.
