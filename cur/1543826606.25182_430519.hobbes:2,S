If the console attached fbcon, then I agree that console should decide
when to detach fbcon.  But that's not what happens, it's fbcon that
attaches itself.
It's not that you're wrong, it's just how the current vt/console layer
works.  If someone do decide to add this feature to the vt/console layer,
then I'm more than willing to have fbcon support that as well.
