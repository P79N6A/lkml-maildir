I looked at the maintainers list and could not find documentation
maintainer. I don't even know if this information is correct but I
thought I'd run it by you. It seems to update my machine with all the
new groovy features.
The Documentation it says to do a "make bzimage" and if that isn't
supported to "make zimage". Neither work on redhat 6.2.
Can you add to the documentation to try "make vmlinux" for all of use
pathetic sparc users that haven't gotten a new distribution since 6.2
:) I had to scour the internet to figure it out! If it would save
anyone else time It's worth it. It was enough to make a grown man cry
:) j/k.
Thanks!
