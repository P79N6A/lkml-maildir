Care to get rid of cool *_UART_MAP macros?
For those who didn't bother to download the patch, the snippet is:
	#define FOO_UART_MAP                { 4, 1, -1, -1, -1 }
		...
	int serial[AT91C_NR_UART] = FOO_UART_MAP;
			[yes, each one is used in exactly one place]
Obviously, AT91C_NR_UART should be AT91C_NR_UARTS, because it is "the number
of UART_s_". And "serial" can be renamed to uart_map or something.
You also constantly cast ioremap() return values to unsigned long and cast
them back to "void __iomem *" back on iounmap()

Then rewrite it as
	static struct ... = {
		[0] = {
			.name = ...
			...
		},
		[1] = {
			.name = ...
			...
		},
	}
And check for non-NULL data in at91_add_device_usbh() is useless:
	at91_add_device_usbh(&carmeva_usbh_data);
	at91_add_device_usbh(&csb337_usbh_data);
	at91_add_device_usbh(&csb637_usbh_data);
	at91_add_device_usbh(&dk_usbh_data);
	at91_add_device_usbh(&ek_usbh_data);
Same for add_device_eth(), _udc(), _cf(). In at91_add_device_mmc() you got it
right.

Use C99 initializers. Everywhere.

It will be removed soon.
at91_wdt_ioctl() isn't __user annotated. Let alone it is ioctl.

It's already somewhere in include/linux/byteorder/

Space before star, please. Also everywhere.

Anyone remembers 1 kmallocated byte?

Potentially even worse than "PAT91S_EMAC", "AT91S_EMACP" combined. Putting P
_there_...
