no, we don't want this. We already allow the re-scheduling of the watchdog to be
round_jiffies() modified so that it coincides with other interrupts.
but at load time we don't want the timer to be postponed at all for up to a whole
second. Since we're doing all sorts of initialization work anyway this is
counterproductive anyway, and you really want the link to come up as soon as
possible, which is exactly what the watchdog handles when it runs first.
I can't possibly see any benefit from this other than that you just add up to a
whole second to the initialization cycle, which is bad.
