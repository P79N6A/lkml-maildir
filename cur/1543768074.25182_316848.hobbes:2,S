Yep.

Yeah, this is a bit worrying. In general we should not be loading
up busy CPUs with any more work, and sleeping idle CPUs should be
done as a blunt "slowpath" operation. Ie. something that works well
enough.

I could probably find some time to do my implementation if you have
a complete working patch for eg. UML.

Yeah that would be good.
