Yep, it's really not scary in any ordering sense!

They need not have completed, but they must have been queued at the
block layer level. IOW, the io scheduler must know about them. Since
it's a block layer device property, we really don't care about system
calls since any of them could amount to 1 or lots more individual io
requests.
But now we have taken a detour from the original problem. As I wrote
above, the io scheduler must know about the requests. When the plug list
ends up in the private process context, the io scheduler doesn't know
about it yet. When a barrier is queued, the block layer does not care
about io that hasn't been issued yet (dirty data in the page cache
perhaps), since if it hasn't been seen, it's by definition not
interesting. But if some of the requests reside in a different process
private request list, then that is a violation of this rule since it
should technically belong to the block layer / io scheduler at that
point. This is where I wanted to use SRCU.

We don't do barriers from user space, it's purely a feature available to
file systems to ensure ordering of writes even at the disk platter
level.

Once a process holds a queue plug, any write issued to that plug list
will do an srcu_read_lock(). So as far as I can tell, the smp_mb() is
needed to ensure that an immediately following synchronize_srcu() from a
barrier write queued on a different CPU will see that srcu_read_lock().
There are no syscall or user-level synchronization.
