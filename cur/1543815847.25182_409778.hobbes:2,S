Ok, in that case I guess all of the header file should be wrapped inside
#ifdef __KERNEL__. Until now it was not possible to include that header
file in order to get the ioctl definition. It would be somewhat
counterproductive to schedule the user interface for removal while at
the same time making it easier to use it.
Also, I don't see any user of the ioctl function in the kernel, although
it's exported. Are there any out-of-tree users?
