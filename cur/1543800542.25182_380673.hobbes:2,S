For example, I add "inline" for static functions which are only called
from one place.
If I'm able to say "this is static function which is called from one
place" I'd do so instead of saying "inline". But omitting the "inline"
with hope that some new gcc probably will inline it anyway (on some
platform?) doesn't seem like a best idea.
But what _is_ the best idea?
