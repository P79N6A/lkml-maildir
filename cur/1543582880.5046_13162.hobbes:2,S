Can you generate statistics on the number of files in each directory,
and the total size of each directory?  For total directory size, it
may be useful to have not only size in kB and/or disk blocks, but also
the sum of raw dentry sizes as well, because directories always show
full block sizes.
This would also be helpful to determine how often indexing will be used
in an "average" system.
Cheers, Andreas
