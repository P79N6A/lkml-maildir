It's Interesting what question Larry is going out of his way NOT to answer.
Ingo asked:

Larry responded, unhelpefully:

So why did Ingo ask the question?  Oh well.
Ingo again:

Larry responded again, but again ducked the question, choosing insead to talk 
about ClearCase.
It seems pretty clear that the people who object to BitKeeper have an easy 
way to force it out out of Kernel developent: You don't have to reproduce 
bitkeeper, just write a version controlled filesystem (or version control 
extension to an existing filesystem) that Linus likes enough to include in 
the tree.  (EVMS probably doesn't qualify as such, but I'm sure Larry could 
make a case it does if he really wanted to.  So nobody really has a license 
to use no-charge bitkeeper, they really just have permission as long as 
Larry's in a good mood.  But this is nothing new, is it?)
It's possible that a version controlled filesystem will never be accepted 
into the Linux tree just because Linus wouldn't want to give up bitkeeper.  
Oh well.  Can't say I've ever personally had a need for one, and you could 
always do it via Coda, assuming the existince of such a tool wouldn't taint 
the Coda parts of the kernel... :)
