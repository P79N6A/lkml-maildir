Subject: [PATCH] fix sparse warning from include/linux/mmzone.h

include/linux/mmzone.h:640:22: warning: potentially expensive pointer subtraction
The code in question was doing a pointer subtraction to find the index of
the zone argument in the node_zones array.  This essentially boils down to:
((unsigned long)zone - (unsigned long)zone->zone_pgdat->node_zones)/sizeof(struct zone)
Which can be expensive if struct zone is not a power of two.  Instead, just
calculate the offsets rather than the index in the array.

This shows up > 30 times in an x86 allyesconfig, would be nice to get
rid of it and makes the code a little more efficient.  I believe this
is correct, unless there is a subtlety I have missed.
