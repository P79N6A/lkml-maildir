Gidday,
I just released man-pages-2.57.
This release is now available for download at:
    
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/manpages
    or 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/manpages
and soon at:
    
ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux-local/manpages
Various things remain to be fixed in man-pages.  A few of the outstanding
FIXME points from section 2 are listed below.  Any assistance with these
points would be most welcome.
Cheers,
Michael

==========
./man2/ioperm.2
     FIXME is the following ("Only the first 0x3ff I/O ports can be
     specified in this manner") still true?  Looking at changes in
     include/asm-i386/processor.h between 2.4 and 2.6 suggests
     that the limit is different in 2.6.
==========
./man2/mprotect.2
     FIXME
     Document PROT_GROWSUP and PROT_GROWSDOWN
==========
./man2/nfsservctl.2
     FIXME The description of nfsservctl() on this page
     is woefully thin.
==========
./man2/shmop.2
     FIXME A good explanation of the rationale for the existence
     of SHMLBA would be useful here
