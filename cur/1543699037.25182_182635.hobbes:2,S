FWIW, here's what RMS said:
    Misusing a GPL-covered program permanently forfeits the right to
    distribute the code at all.

I guess I can't disagree in principle that a contract could cross
almost any boundary.  But it seems vanishingly unlikely that anyone
(not to speak of IBM) would agree to a contract with such
boundary-piercing powers as SCO claims.  For this reason, I don't
think that even the most bold claims for the GPL's virulence help
SCO one bit.  On the contrary, any intelligent discussion of
boundaries can only undermine SCO's nonsensical case.
I agree with you about the importance of figuring out where the
boundaries lie.  I also wish the FSF would get more involved in this
debate, but I have to say, they seem to be avoiding the hard
questions, perhaps because they're afraid to say anything that will
restrict them later.  The best statement I think I've read from them
is
    
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLInProprietarySystem
which introduces an "arms length" standard.

For me, this doesn't pass the giggle test.

They seem to have waived that claim, at least, by deeming system
calls "arms length" communication.
