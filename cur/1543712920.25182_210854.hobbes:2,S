That is there in my list of things to test.

I don't do any of this. I just have a separate quiescent state counter
for softirq RCU. It is incremented for regular quiescent points
like cswitch, userland, idle loop as well as at the completion
of each softirq handler. call_rcu_bh() uses its own queues.
Everything else works like call_rcu().
