For uncached memory, right?

For kernel mapping change_page_attr() takes care of it,
and for user space memory following all mappings is the only
reliable way to find out which process needs to be killed
anyways - and when you do that you can as well unmap
or just kill.

Consider what happens with such a race: either the PCI master
gets an bus abort because it still sees the corrupted data.
Or it already accesses the repaired data. Both is ok.

The "Linux guidelines" might be different.
