Hi folks,
another update of the patch, which addresses some of the reactions and 
concerns which I got in reply:
  * The mount option is now called `epoc' instead of `oldfat'
  * fat_search_long now jumps directly to EODir when it finds a
    zero-marked entry (it took some hard looking, but I belief this
    is safe).
  * fat_readdirx logic is slightly simplified (but can't jump to EODir
    on a zero-marked entry, regrettably).
Thanks for your feedback!
I'll try to keep this patch up-to-date with new 2.6 kernels. The latest
version can always be found on 
http://debian.frodo.looijaard.name/
Thanks,
  Frodo
