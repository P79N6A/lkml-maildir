Depends on the version of "Unix".  IBM's Unix System Services (Unix for
MVS) uses 32 bit pids structured like this - big endian.
Bit 0     - 0
Bit 1-7   - slot usage counter
Bit 8-15  - reserved, currently 0
Bit 16-31 - pid slot number.
USS allows for 64K of pid slots.  When creating a process, it uses the
first free slot, incrementing the slot usage counter to make the pid
numbers "unique".  If a parent forks 128 times and the child exits each
time and no other process is created (so USS picks the same free slot
each time), then the 32 bit pid will wrap after 128 forks.  I can do
that in under 2 seconds.
Or to put it another way, any code that relies on a reasonable time
between pid reuse is "forked".  It is not guaranteed by Unix nor Posix.
