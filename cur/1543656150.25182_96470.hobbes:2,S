I think setting up something like /etc/lilo.conf say /etc/kexec.conf
is probably practical.  You have already seen how difficult it is to
bring up the hardware into a sane state from an arbitrary point.  So
we can cross the crash dump bridge when we come to it.
If this was simply a case of supporting linux the problem would be
some easier.  But I also intend to support booting other operating
systems.
Now I think there is some advantage in setting up a new set of page
tables and just switching to those at kexec time, it slightly reduces
the amount of work I need to do at kexec time, enhancing the
reliability of something like kexec on panic.   And that could
probably be exported in /proc/<pid>/mem.  So if and when I go this
route I will keep your request in mind.

Oh, and of course I accept patches so you don't have to wait for me to
implement something.
