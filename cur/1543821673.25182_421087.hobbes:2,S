It's a non-back-compatible change which means that people will install
2.6.18+, will set stuff up which uses more that five nested links and some
will discover that they can no longer run their software on older kernels.
It'll only hurt a very small number of people, but for those people, it
will hurt a lot.  And I can't really think of anything we can do to help
them, apart from making the new behaviour runtime-controllable, defaulting
to "off", but add a once-off printk when we hit MAX_NESTED_LINKS, pointing
them at a document which tells them how to turn on the new behaviour and
which explains the problems.  Which sucks.
But I guess as major distros are 2.6.16-based, this is a good time to make
this change.
