The author (me) didn't use spin_lock_irqsave because the slowness of the
card means that approach caused horrible problems like losing serial data
at 38400 baud on some chips. Rememeber many 8390 nics on PCI were ISA
chips with FPGA front ends.

Ok the logic behind the 8390 is very simple:
Things to know
	- IRQ delivery is asynchronous to the PCI bus
	- Blocking the local CPU IRQ via spin locks was too slow
	- The chip has register windows needing locking work
So the path was once (I say once as people appear to have changed it
in the mean time and it now looks rather bogus if the changes to use
disable_irq_nosync_irqsave are disabling the local IRQ)
	Take the page lock
	Mask the IRQ on chip
	Disable the IRQ (but not mask locally- someone seems to have
		broken this with the lock validator stuff)
		[This must be _nosync as the page lock may otherwise
			deadlock us]
	Drop the page lock and turn IRQs back on
	At this point an existing IRQ may still be running but we can't
	get a new one
	Take the lock (so we know the IRQ has terminated) but don't mask
the IRQs on the processor
	Set irqlock [for debug]
	Transmit (slow as ****)
	re-enable the IRQ
We have to use disable_irq because otherwise you will get delayed
interrupts on the APIC bus deadlocking the transmit path.
Quite hairy but the chip simply wasn't designed for SMP and you can't
even ACK an interrupt without risking corrupting other parallel
activities on the chip.
