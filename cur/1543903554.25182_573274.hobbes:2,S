Hi all!
I've just released Linux 2.4.35-rc1. Nothing critical, two bugs fixed,
a few PCI ID updates and the ability to disable TSC usage on x86_64 by
specifying "notsc" on the command line for users of broken dual-core
systems with no HPET and unsynced TSC.
My patch queue is empty and I'm satisfied with current code quality.
I will probably release -final by the end of the week if nobody reports
a missing fix till then. That way, people will be able to plan upgrades
of production systems during the holidays.
I will announce 2.4.34-stable in a separate mail.
Willy
