I also wonder why it was required and can't be done in normal way...
Maybe worth trying to switch to C, really.

Ok, just one simple question:
how do you propose to handle network sysctls and network 
statistics/information in proc?
_how_ can you imagine this namespaces should work?
I see no elegant solution for this, do you? If there is any, I will be 
happy with namespaces again.

Out of curiosity, do you have any _working_ examples of other usages?
I see only theoretical examples from you, but would like to hear from 
anyone who _uses_/_knows_ how to use it.

I see... Any idea why this can be required?
(without proc? :) )
BTW, if you have virtualized networking, but not isolated fs namespace 
in this case, how are you going to handle unix sockets? Or maybe it's 
another separate namespace?

because, the question was quite simple, isn't it?
