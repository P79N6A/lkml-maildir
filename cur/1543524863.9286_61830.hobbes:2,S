In arch/i386/kernel/process.c is the following...
/*
 * This routine reboots the machine by asking the keyboard
 * controller to pulse the reset-line low. We try that for a while,
 * and if it doesn't work, we do some other stupid things.
 */
Which, although it has that Torvaldian charm (whether by LT or not), 
seems to be completely obsolete, and quite misleading. I think.
Also, in the Documentation/kernel-docs.txt file in 2.3...
          + Title: "Network Buffers And Memory Management"
            Author: Alan Cox.
            URL: 
http://www.ssc.com/lj/issue30/kk30.html
and the URL for Wilcox's ext2 doc were inaccesible by me, of the 5 or 6
URLs in there I tried.
And DAMN that kernel cross-reference site in .no is awesome. Almost 
validates the web.
