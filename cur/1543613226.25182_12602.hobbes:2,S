Ah, a slight problem there. The LVM volume happens to reside on an AACRAID
controller, which won't get passed fsck'ing with 2.4.16. 2.4.17-pre8 seems
to have fixed that problem for reasons unknown.
The .17-preX LVM code should be based on, if not the same as the .16 code
shouldn't it? The log suggests only changes on the devfs side. If I just
stuck to the LVM code in the kernel, instead of using the code provided in
the LVM 1.0.1 package, would that be a fair test?
Cheers
Matt
