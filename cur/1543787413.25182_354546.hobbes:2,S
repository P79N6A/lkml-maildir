that's what i meant with "i think ohci-hcd does not fully disable
interrupts in it's suspend callback"...

i'd say: yes put that line there to shut up the controller during suspend
and nuke the free_irq() in suspend to avoid problems during restore (attached).

attached the patch that kills the free_irq()/request_irq() pair in USB.

[PATCH] usb/core/hcd-pci.c: don't free_irq() on suspend
the free_irq() in USB suspend breaks resume on some setups where USB
(ohci/ehci) shares the interrupt with an other device.
