Hi there.
Can I ask whether Hardlinks or SymLinks are supposed to work in the
vfat file system?
My own thoughts is that one or the other of these are pretty much
identical to what Win9x calls "shortcuts", and those are clearly
supported, so we should be able to use whatever mechanism that uses to
support them as well. However, I'm probably well off beam here...
I realise that we're in the brown paper bag stage of kernel
development at the moment, so I'm not asking for this to be added if
it isn't already there...
Best wishes from Riley.
