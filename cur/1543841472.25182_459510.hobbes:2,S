Problem 1: acpi_reserve_io_ranges() needs to return an acpi_status
like AE_OK or AE_CTRL_TERMINATE, not a -EINVAL.
Problem 2: I don't understand how your patch works.  An ACPI device
has a list of resources it uses.  Are you saying that claiming all
the IO port resources of a PNP0C01 or PNP0C02 device causes the ACPI
memory hotplug driver to fail?
Is there some conflict between those PNP0C01 resources and the
resources of a hotplug memory device?  Can you figure out exactly
what the conflict is by disassembling the DSDT for those devices?
We should understand this better before introducing special cases
to the motherboard driver.  We should be able to trust the ACPI
description of the motherboard resources.  The motherboard driver
currently claims only I/O port resources, but it really should
claim MMIO resources as well.
