Hi, i'm writing you because i have a problem on a lot of boxes with the 2.4 
kernels.
I have a lot of zombie [defunct] procs .
when i launch for example a simple script that do
while :; do ls ; ps x ; lsmod ; pstree ; etc etc etc ; done
after abount an hour the script crash and a ps x output is
[ls <defunct>]
ecc
when procs is defunct the system became instable. gcc tell me 
error in /usr/bin/gcc:2328 and any programs tell me that i've not the ncurses 
libraries ecc 
if i boot my machine without /proc filesystem it's very stable :)
i've tryed 2.2 kernels and there is no problem
my boxes are P3 1000 with via apollo chipset / P4 1.5ghz with intel 845 
ide hard disks vga 32mb tnt2 and slackware 8 distro
i've the same problem with all the distros with 2.4 kernels
it's a big problem because i have a relaying mail server that defunct 
sendmail!
sorry for my english :)
