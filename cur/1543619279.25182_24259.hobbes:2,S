Unfortunatly I think the PPC tree has hit both cases :)  The restriction
that everything gets moved as a changeset is fine tho. One problem is
an out-of-order (or rather a single) changeset which creates a few
files.
The other problem is we create a file (say
arch/ppc/kernel/prpmc750_setup.c) and then 4-5 changesets effect this
file (code, code, bk mv, code, code).  If this is doable in multiple
out-of-order sends to the parent, that'd probably be OK.
