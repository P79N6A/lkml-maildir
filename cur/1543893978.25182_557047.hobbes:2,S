agreed, because you cannot imagine at the beginning all fair uses of your
project. It's a good thing that people can use it, thinking "hey, it's not
explicitly allowed but I think I can defend my case".

not really. They would lose their job. They need a gray world to get
customers, but they want to decide what half is black and what half
is white in front of the judge depending on their customer's needs.

And I think that for many people (including myself), it's all of these in
this order :
  - something to learn (when you're at school)
  - something to pass boredom (when you're at school too)
  - the technology (when you're working on designing new products)
  - the license (when you finally try to put your products on the market)
