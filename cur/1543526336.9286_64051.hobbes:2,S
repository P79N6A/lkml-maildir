 without starting a pissing contest, documentation IS part of the job-
its not a fun part of the job, but its got to be done if somebody else
is expected to use or maintain your code.  
 From my experience, the best technical writers ARE programmers.
 Having said that, I'm just as guilty about not documenting my stuff as
the next guy- It takes a lot of time to follow through on a project, and
nobody ever has enough time...
peace-
