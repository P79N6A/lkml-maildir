Hi,

So, with one transaction, can I write an arbitrary number of bytes to
the device, and then, in the same transaction, can I read one (or no,
or with some controllers, more than one) byte(s) back?

Sure, I rather meant "a bus _for_ I^2C EEPROMs which use 8-bit (+3)
addressing".

Interesting. Still, that limits it to 8-bit-addressable EEPROMs.
Are such things documented somewhere on the net (some datasheet maybe)?
