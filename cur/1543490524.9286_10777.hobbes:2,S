I just uploaded the ncr53c8xx+sym53c8xx driver bundle diffs for 2.0.37-pre8 
to the tux site.
ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/roudier/misc-stuff/ncr-8xx-896-bundle-for-linux-2.0.37-pre8.patch.gz
The equivalent patches for 2.0.36 and 2.2.3 are also available from the same 
directory:
        ncr-8xx-896-bundle-for-linux-2.0.36.patch.gz
        ncr-8xx-896-bundle-for-linux-2.2.3.patch.gz
If you think (as I do), that this stuff is good, then you may want to 
tell Alan Cox that he should incorporate it into linux-2.0.37.
Regards,
   Gérard.
