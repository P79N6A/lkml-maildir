It simplifies (I hope) a bit the seqfile.
The interface is very similar except that you don't need to deal
with debugfs stuffs, sorting, and position inside the seqfile.
And it unifies the stat files into a common directory instead of
having them grained into a mess of debugfs filesystem....
I could let it handle only stat_show when you have only one entry but that
would break the sense of stat_show.
If it's so common to have only one stat entry, perhaps I could provide a special callback
for that, something like stat_show_unique()...
Hm?
Frederic.
