There are not many scenarios where this makes any sense.  One is where
the code is working on a collection of related cpu data and the whole
collection is protected by a per cpu mutex.  Taking the mutex stops
your race.  I doubt if we have any code like that yet.
The other possibility is to allow work to preempt the current process
while it spins in udelay().  This is a problem on systems that use the
cycle counter (TSC, ITC) and different cpus run at different rates.

I am not going to be too persistent about this facility.  If it seems
too risky or of too little use, then forget it.
