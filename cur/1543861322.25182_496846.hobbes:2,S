I suspect this can't help either.
The problem is that flush_workqueue() may be called while cpu hotplug event
in progress and CPU_DEAD waits for kthread_stop(), so we have the same dead
lock if work->func() does flush_workqueue(). This means that Andrew's change
to use preempt_disable() is good and anyway needed.
I am starting to believe we need some more intrusive changes in workquue.c.
Oleg.
