The authors of that code made it GPL. You have no right to change that. Its
exactly the same as someone taking all your code and making it binary only.
You are
	-	subverting a digital rights management system
			[5 years jail in the USA]
	-	breaking a license
but worse than that you are ignoring the basic moral rights of the authors
of that code.
