Which is what the original 0.1.8 patch included, his fixes were included.

There was no missing header, if you see the patch I sent you (about 3
times), the header file is in there.

Besides the obvious version changes and difficulty maintaining a driver
where anyone seems to be able to change it in the official tree, the
objections were deteremined and fixed in the patch I sent you.
Refresh my memory as it seems things have  changed in kernel patch
submission process:
There is someone called a driver author or maintainer, this person
recieves patches for fixes from various people, he/she then compiles them
into a single patch and submits it to the kernel tree maintiner.  However
nowdays it seems the kernel tree maintainer has the descretion to accept
patches from anyone how puts up a fight, is this the case nowdays?  
If so then please let me know, so I don't waste anymore of my time on this
driver and let someone else play these silly games and maintain it.
