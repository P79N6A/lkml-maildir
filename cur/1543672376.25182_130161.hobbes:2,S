It should, but so far I know it cannot do every thing with
dma.
My writer use:
pingi2:~ # hdparm -v /dev/hdc
/dev/hdc:
 HDIO_GET_MULTCOUNT failed: Input/output error
 IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 BLKRAGET failed: Input/output error
 HDIO_GETGEO failed: Invalid argument
And I see no problems.
At least you can try hdparm -u1 (use a RW media).
