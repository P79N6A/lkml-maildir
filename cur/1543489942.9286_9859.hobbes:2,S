Hi everyone.
I heard that with the new PF_PACKET socket family mechanism, it's now
possible to determine a packet's direction (incoming or outgoing).
Can anyoe confirm this?  Is it true?  If so, can anyone direct me to the
proper structure and fields that contain this info?
Thanks, and hoping for a reply.
Gerard
