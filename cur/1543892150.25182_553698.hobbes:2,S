Right, I see your point; however considering that its a system
allocation, and all these constraints get violated by interrupts anyway,
its more of an application container than a strict allocation container.
Are you actually seeing the described behaviour, or just being pedantic
(nothing wrong with that per-se)?
I would actually be bold and make it worse by proposing something like
this, which has the benefit of making the reserve threshold system wide.
