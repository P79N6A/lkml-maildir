There are .sah files, in which the data is stored to analyse. So i
deleted these files and the client downloads a new package -> new data
package.
Yes, it did happen that the segfault reoccured and there is nothing in
the dmesg. This was also my first thought, then checked
/var/log/messages with a tail and it stucked. No ctrl-c.
Tried this:
#define _GNU_SOURCE 1
#include <fenv.h>
main() {
    double zero=0.0;
    double one=1.0;
    
    feenableexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);
    
    one /=zero;
}
...but nothing happens.
