I tried removing all the spinlocks inside the interrupt handler.  Seemed 
to work fine for a while, but still hung (at worst, it looks missing 
locks means we might screw up and read / write the wrong CMOS register, 
not hang or crash).
So I took down 2nd CPU with hotplug (did not yet try UP kernel though).  
It took a longer time, but still hung.  Seems not to be a spinlock 
problem, but I'll turn on debugging anyway.

Will do.  That looks much more suspicious like.  I thought I killed it 
already, but had only got this:
# CONFIG_HPET_RTC_IRQ is not set
If that still crashes, I'll try running cmos access in a loop in userspace to see if maybe the port I/O is tickling a chipset bug (the only other report I know of is on same chipset, nVidia MCP51).  Maybe SMM handler is accessing CMOS or something wacked out.  <laughs hysterical... stops laughing when the theory actually sounds plausible>.  Stuck in SMM is not good for CPU thermal throttling ... hopefully Turion's don't reach nuclear emission point.
Would also explain maybe why NMI watchdog doesn't seem to notice anything wrong.
Thanks,
Zach
