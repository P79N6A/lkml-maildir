IRQ 5 may well have gone to an onboard device.
There are two things to note here:
1.	By default if you boot with non PnP OS the BIOS will assign IRQ's
to PnP devices and we would be best to try and keep the existing value when
possible (so the PCI/ISA routing is correct)
2.	If we know enough about the PCI/ISA routing then we can do the proper
PCI/ISA assignments in the pci layer but if not then the next best heuristic
might actually be 'edge triggered first'
