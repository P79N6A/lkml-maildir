The problem is that the wacom kernel driver in the 2.6.19-rc5 kernel 
doesn't work with my Volito 2 tablet. The cursor stays in the bottom 
right hand corner of the screen and only responds to me moving the pen 
by jittering about a bit.
 From what you said it seems that the kernel wacom driver treats my 
volito2 as though it's an intuos. The kernel correctly identifies it as 
a volito 2 in the system log but if I don't apply that sed to the source 
before I compile the kernel the tablet doesn't work.
