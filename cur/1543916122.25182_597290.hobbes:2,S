Yes, this works fine. We still go into C3, but this seems not longer to
brick the box.

I found some other subtle thinko in the clock events code while I was
heading down the swsusp_suspend code path. I wait for confirmation that
it does not brick some endangered boxen, though. Still with this change
in the clock events code, my VAIO goes into C2 or C3 and causes the box
to wait for a helping keystroke.
The correct solution would be, that the ACPI code ignores the lower
C-states during suspend / resume. I simply rmmod'ed the processor module
before suspend and the problem is solved as well. The cpuidle patches
make this problem more prominent due to the possible more direct switch
into lower power states, when we wait for a long time on something.
I think we really should not fiddle with the various cpu states during
the critical parts of suspend / resume. Let's keep it simple. We have
the same policy during boot and I think the suspend / resume critical
parts have similar constraints.
