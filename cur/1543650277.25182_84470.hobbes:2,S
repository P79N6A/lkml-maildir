Hi Randy, no it's not unpopular :) Those were posted togheter with the
patch :
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll.txt
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll_create.txt
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll_ctl.txt
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll_wait.txt
to try to explain the new API from user side. From kernel side epoll
completely uses the sk_wake_async() already available by many versions,
and also it is not expected to offer kernel services to other kernel
modules.
