  I have not analyzed the backtraces to much in detail but I guess the
following confuses the code (and I agree that it's kind of ugly from
quota code to do that):
  i_mutex of inode containing quota file is acquired after all other
quota locks. i_mutex of all other inodes is acquired before quota locks.
Quota code makes sure (by resetting inode operations and setting special
flag on inode) that noone tries to enter quota code while holding
i_mutex on a quota file...
  Anyways it's nice checker that it caches this kind of things ;) None
of the previous ones did.
