Sorry, realized I might not have been clear as to what I meant!  The
patch was attached to the bugzilla entry, but I'll attach it here as
well.  My description of the patch itself was really as complicated as
it gets too (just two lines, switch (void*)mac to
&mac->assoc.work.work in
net/ieee80211/softmac/ieee80211softmac_assoc.c), just a small bug
while somebody was rushing through the work/delayed_work changes.
