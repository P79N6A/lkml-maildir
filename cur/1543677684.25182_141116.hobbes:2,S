I'm not sure, but for what I *see* (using a PCMCIA NE2000 clone with my
Laptop) this problem occures by this:
- Insert your card (after "/etc/init.d/pcmcia-cs start" is done, that
  card will be recognized and configured).
- shutdown your laptop. This involves "/etc/init.d/pcmcia-cs stop".
- _Later on_ (after the card should already have gone away because
  you've just stopped the pcmcia subsystem), "/etc/init.d/networking
  stop" tried to "ifconfig ethX down" the card - Bang.
The cardbus/hotplug stuff might be different here. I think this is
solely a problem of the pure PCMCIA stuff...
