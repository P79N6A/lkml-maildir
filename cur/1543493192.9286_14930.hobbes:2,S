At work we have a few 2 or 4-way NCR boxes which use some NCR (as opposed to
Intel) SMP scheme for the Pentiums that are in them (I'm told they are not
PPros).
I don't suppose there is a chance that Linux supports these in any shape or
form? (Well if Alan can do SMP optimized 3Com501 support there is hope...)
Cheers
