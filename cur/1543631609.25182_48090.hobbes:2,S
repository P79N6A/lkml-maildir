Understood, I think that's everyone's goal in the end anyway.

Yes, After using a -AA series, then recompiling Glibc with some
optimizations, kind of re-purifying the system a few times. 
Then applying some Oracle patches, (to fix some Oracle bugs in our
environment) then voila!  We can have a *very* fast Linux box on 4P or
8P with 4-8GB RAM with an uptime of >60 days. I've never a box longer
than that to prove otherwise, but it was stable from a *production*
point of view. 
Also, adjusting the bdflush parms greatly increases stability I've found
in this respect. On top of all of that though, using XFS with increased
logbuffers and LVM or EVMS to do striping really improved performance
with IO too. 
Problem is, my tests are *unofficial* but I plan to do something perhaps
at OSDL and see what we can show in a max single-box config with real
hardware, etc. 
Anyway, I digress.
