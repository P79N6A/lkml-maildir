(set boot issues aside for now)
It could.  I use it on x86 and IA-64 now.  I think Richard Hirst found the
last (knock on wood) of my endianness bugs about 6 months ago, so I know it
works on BE and LE non-Intel machines.  It's in the partitioning menu, not
specific to arch.  The only arch dependency in code is on asm-ia64/efi.h for
some typedefs, which is annoying but not hard to fix if desired (move
relevant bits to include/linux/efi.h).

As you point out, booting is BIOS-specific.  So for now boot a disk with a
native scheme (where your OS resides already) and mount that 64XB file
system for data afterwords.  By the time that doesn't work, 32-bit CPUs will
be dead anyhow.
Thanks,
Matt
