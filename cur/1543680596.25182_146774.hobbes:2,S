As the driver is _in_ the kernel tree, why does it need to be compilable
for older kernels?  :)
Anyway, yes, just use the structure name, not the typedef.  That is
backwards compatible.
For example, don't use "urb_t" but instead, "struct urb".
Hm, I think I did actually change one of the structure names, but I
don't think you use that structure in the host controller.
Hope this helps,
