Thanks, but I already tried this...

Well I already tried to set maximum latencies etc to the cards to
prioritize to no avail... This did not make a difference though. Maybe
this is due to the fact that a lot more has to be transferred (not just
sound, but video data) and this is not possible in a single
transaction ... ?!
