Oh, fsck...

Not ideal, but not worse than the variant before the fs/super.c rewrite.
And yes, that's what was intended to be there. Said that, removing the
automagical DQUOT_OFF completely looks like a good idea. If there is no
serious reason to keep it in the kernel I would prefer to move it to
userland. We already have to do quota-related stuff if umount(2) fails...
