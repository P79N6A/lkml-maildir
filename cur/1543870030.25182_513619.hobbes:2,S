Actually, we don't in this case. This patch in essence moves "preempt_enable"
from "lock" to "unlock" side. Zero impact for non-PREEMPT_RCU builds, except
.text grows a bit.
Before this patch, page_lock_anon_vma() does preempt_enable() before return,
but this can't help because ->preempt_count was incremented by spin_lock().

I also thought about things like
	rcu_read_lock_when_we_know_that_preemption_disabled()
	rcu_read_lock_when_we_know_that_irqs_disabled()
which are noops when !PREEMPT_RCU.
