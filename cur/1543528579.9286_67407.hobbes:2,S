Good Day,
I have made a number of attempts to contact via E-Mail Mr. Andre Hedrick at
hedrick@astro.dyer.vanderbilt.edu.
My reason for this is that I'm having problems with using a IDE Hard Drive under
2.2.14 which was working fine on 2.0.35.
I found in the Maintainers file Mr. Hedrick's name mentioned as the IDE Driver
Specialist.
I keep getting my E-Mails returned with a "User Unknown" Message.
1.   Could someone please tell me if the information in the Maintainers file
     is incorrect?
2.   Has Mr. Hedrick moved to a New Location?  If so, would someone please
     tell me his new Address.
3.   Has someone else taken over his responsibilities in the IDE Area?
Any help in pointing me to the correct person who can handle IDE Hard Drive
Problems/Questions would be greatly appreciated.
Yours truly,
Frank Krauss
