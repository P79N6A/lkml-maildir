No, I don't believe so.  I notice there's use of PageReserved and page
count manipulation in there, which we may well want to rationalize in
a later phase, perhaps replacing by __GFP_COMP then; but I don't see
any need to change what you're doing at this stage.
Looking again, to see why you even thought you might need to change:
the vital thing you're doing (aside from the PageReserved, which is
becoming irrelevant), which is missing from the regular high-order
allocation, is the set_page_count(page, 1).  That's why you don't
need to change: the problems I was writing of come from when the
0-order page count goes down to 0.
Makes me wonder whether there could be a useful halfway stage to
compound pages, whether it would help for the page allocator to
set those counts to 1 generally.
