While attempting to compile the Digi Etherlite 16/32 driver on a
server running Fedora Core 5 (2.6.17-1.2145_FC5-smp-i686), I ran
across this error:
/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/dgrp-1.9/driver/dgrp_net_ops.c:453: error:
'struct tty_struct' has no member named 'flip'
The driver works in FC3 and FC4. Since I have the source for the
driver, my question is what has changed in the kernel and where do I
look (in the kernel) to find what to change to make the driver
compatible with FC5?
Thanks,
PGA
