Patches against rc3 cleanly too :-)
It did the job in my box, now compiling 2 packages ( "make" and "nice
-19 make -j 4") from kde too, and using vmware with winxp and imesh
running keeps my box running smoothly. Haven't seen a single paging in
almost 1 hour of uptime.
Thanks for the good job Paul Komkoff and Rik van Riel ! and of course
Alan and Marcello
Best regards
Max
p.d. sorry for my english, I cant even notice if i made a mistake while
