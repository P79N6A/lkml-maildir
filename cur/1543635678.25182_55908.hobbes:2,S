You can't use FPU operations in the x86 kernel.
Maybe you should do this in user space ? Certainly the more I talk to people
like Nicholas Pitre the more it seems to me that most of the kernel side
stuff is the wrong approach.
Instead would it not be better to
-	Fix select on /dev/vcsa to work
-	During init start up after init processes are running have
	the init tasks (or for that matter the kernel) fire up the
	speech helper
The fact 95% of the speakup drivers are going to spontaneously go 
obsolete the moment serial ports vanish bothers me.
