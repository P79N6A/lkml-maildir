It's unclear to me how the PDA code differs from the methods of elder
kernels apart from the observation that newer cpu revisions have better
performance in/around segmentation relative to arithmetic operations on
%esp. I'm certainly in favor of the move; IRQ stacks could be made
rather deep and cheaply at that. I may get around to writing it this
week if no one else does it first.
