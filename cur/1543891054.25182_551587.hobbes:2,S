If we have a page which is on the zone LRU with refcount=1 and someone does
put_page() on it, we will take that page off the zone LRU and then actually
free the page.
I am assuming that your patches change that logic so that we will also
remove that page from the per-container LRU at the same time?
If so, the problem which I see is that, under rare circumstances, that
final put_page() will occur from interrupt context.  Hence we would be
trying to remove the page from the per-container LRU at interrupt time. 
But the locks which you have in there are not suited for taking from
interrupt context.
