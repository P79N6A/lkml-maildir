kmalloc() allocates physically contiguous pages. 1M is a hell of a lot
of contig pages to ask for. I doubt you can get that much except at
early boot. But, if the pages don't actually need to be physically
contiguous, then you can use vmalloc() - it'll give you a virtually
contiguous range but the pages are not nessesarily physically
contiguous.
Why do you need this much btw?
