Subject: [PATCH] Further VFS & ext2fs cleanup. TESTERS NEEDED!
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

	Folks, the patch in question contains:
1) sys_mknod() cleanup - now it uses ->create() for regular files,
leaving ->mknod() method to deal only with devices, fifos and sockets.
2) general ext2 cleanup
3) ext2-specific parts of inode and superblock are allocated separartely.
Rationale: unions in struct inode and struct super_block are bogus and
make inodes too heavyweight, no matter what fs we are using. It becomes
especially ugly if we want to implement layered filesystems.
	I'm going to make analogous separation for other filesystems too,
indeed, but I decided to start from the most, erm, critical place. Help in
testing is VERY welcome.
	The beast is too large to post it here, so I'm putting it on
ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/ext2-patch.9.gz
	WARNING: since this stuff touches ext2fs driver DON'T TRY IT ON
YOUR REGULAR FILESYSTEMS READ/WRITE. Always mount a scratch monkey ;-/
							Cheers,
								Al
