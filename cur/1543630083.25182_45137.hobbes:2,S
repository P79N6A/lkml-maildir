   Linux TCP implementation will always be more powerful and more flexible 
   than any NIC, too.  I doubt they have netlink and netfilter on NICs, for 
   example :)
It has the same problem as proprietary implementations of the BSD
stack, same bugs and same enhancements done N-times instead of once.
Anyone who thinks that having a different TCP implementation on each
different kind of network card installed on your system is sane, would
you please pass it on brotha so I can smoke some of it too! :-)
On a more serious note, it might be at some level considerable (the
maintainence nightmare et al.) if there was some real life
demonstrable performance gain with current systems.
For example, do a SpecWEB run with TUX both using on-chip-TCP and
without, same networking card.  Show a demonstrable gain from the
on-chip-TCP implementation.  I bet you can't.  If you can make such a
claim using a setup that other people could reproduce themselves by
buying your card and running the test, I'll eat all of my words.
