I have found the exact reason why NAT does not work;
- The patched linux box ignores IP checksum errors
- Since now the source address is mofidified without checksumming, NAT also
carries that wrong checksum
- Other boxes does not ignore the checksum and drop packets
I think the solution is here, I have done many different modifications to
get the system redirect packets with wrong checksum. Now all to be done, is
to correct this checksum by changing some code in ip_input.c so that it
recalculates the checksum when the packets seem to arrive from 192.168.1.1. 
Where in the code then?

Are you trying to ping 192.168.77.1 from 192.168.0.30?
Can you give me an iptables -L -n -t nat, ifconfig and route -n from the
patched box and also route 
-n and ifconfig from the dummy client at 192.168.0.30 so I can try and get a
handle on what you are 
doing and how it all is supposed to work?
