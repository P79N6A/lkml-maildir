I thought debugfs was meant for just debugging.  As there is no plans
for standardizing its namespace, why are we allowing ourselves to rely
on it being mounted at all?
AFAICT, there should be no excuse for userspace to actually rely on any
of the data within debugfs.  Otherwise we end up with yet another
filesystem whose role is: Chaotic hodgepodge of magic files created by
drivers that couldn't bother to be well-organized.
Please, let's not make debugfs part of userspace.  Keep it for what it
is, debugging purposes only.
