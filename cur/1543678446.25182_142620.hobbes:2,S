Unfortunately, what is good for a desktop box is often counter
productive for a server :-(

Well, no, opaque window moving is fine if the CPU isn't at 100%.  If
it is, I'd rather see choppy window movements than have a server
application starved of CPU.  That's just my preference, though.

I totally agree, but it's really tempting to say that that's the
distribution's responsibility to renice the X server, and let the
kernel default to doing the Right Thing, which is to starve screen
refreshes in favour of 'real' work.
Of course, people who are running X on a server for admin tasks could
always renice their X server to a lower priority to achieve a similar
effect.

Those programs are broken by design :-), (especially on NUMA
hardware).
I was just thinking that with cache-friendly processes being given a
bigger timeslice, we wouldn't be filling the cache with irrelevant
data so often.
