#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE< LinuxVersionCode(2,1,93)
   #include <linux/bios32.h>
#endif
#if !defined(__i386__)
   #error "This driver has only been tested on the x86 platform"
#endif
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE < LinuxVersionCode(2,2,0)
   #error "This driver only works with kernel 2.2.0 and later"
#endif
Said snippet is taken from drivers/scsi/ips.c. Grep for LINUX_VERSION_CODE
in drivers/* shows tons of checks for 2.1.23, 2.1.45, quite a few checks
for 1.3.<something>, yodda, yodda, but this one takes the cake.
