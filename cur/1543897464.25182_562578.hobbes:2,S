Hm.  The number of __ASSEMBLY__s end up being pretty large, and it just 
seemed cleaner to put them in separate headers.

Because there are other headers which just need some type 
forward-declarations, and don't need the whole set of ELF types 
defined.  In particular, linux/module.h - which is included all over the 
place in the kernel - needs a couple of ELF types declared, and 
including it all over the place is just a waste.  Also, there were some 
nasty cyclic header dependency problems around linux/elf.h, 
linux/module.h, linux/bug.h and asm/bug.h which ended up leading to some 
awkward hacks; I need to remind myself what the problems were and see if 
this elf cleanup helps (pretty sure it should).

linux/elf.h ends up pulling in a really surprising amount of stuff, 
mostly because it ends up including asm/elf.h.  asm/elf.h, in turn, 
depending on the architecture, pulls in a wide variety of other 
headers.  When I cleaned this up, I found quite a few buggy .c files 
which ended up relying on implicit includes via this chain.
Given that there's been a general push to try and cut down on the number 
of header dependency entanglements, I thought I could contribute while 
solving my own immediate problems.
linux/elfcore.h is specifically related to ELF core files, so the two 
corefile notes-related headers could be moved there.
