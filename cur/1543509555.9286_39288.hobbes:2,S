	Initial condition was stated as:  "ia32 system",

	Thanks for the "b", but for grabbing I would (myself) use
	initially raw partition and Raw-IO, then I would pull the
	data out from there in a more leisure pace to normal
	filesystem for non-realtime task of editing -- and for
	the playback I would again drop it into the Raw-IO...
	For video playback (and grabbing) nothing really beats
	filesystems with 32-to-256 kB block sizes, and schedulable
	IO.  Linux does not have such a beast - so far...
	(Getting extent indexing into EXT2 would allow it to mutate
	 towards such wonder animal, though..)
	If you want to play some, my LFS things are at:
