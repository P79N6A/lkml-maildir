I've seen reports on linux-embedded that it's still possible to boot with
2M. "Installation" is a function of the distribution.

It's not really a useful number. For instance, it ignores the fact that
you can boot off a floppy and still have a useful piece of software, like
linux-router or tomsrtbt. Most people don't need the kernel sources.  Etc.
