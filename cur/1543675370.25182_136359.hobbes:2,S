Hello !
I've done a few tests with -rc6 on my dev machine (dual xp 1.5G, 512 MB, scsi).
It's the *FIRST* time I have ever seen my mouse cursor hang (just a little bit
however, and totally acceptable) ! Usually, my kernel include -aa VM and lowlat
patches, and I've never encountered this behaviour on this machine with such a
configuration. However, with stock kernel, I admit that during the 2 minutes it
takes to write the 2G file, I see the mouse stick two or three times during
about 1 second, which is quite acceptable IMHO. Opening an xterm may take 10s
to get to the prompt (more annoying). Same to launch 'ps'.
I use a fairly simple window manager (ctwm), which doesn't access the disk once
it's launched. It never gets stuck during all the operation if I disable the
swap. If I enable the swap, it sometimes takes one or two seconds to draw a
menu. The swap is used up to about 4 MB.
I then tried -rc6 with ll_rw_blk from -rc5, and it's worse, even with swap
disabled. The hangs happen more often, but are about the same durations. So I
confirm that -rc6 is better here than -rc5.
I retried with rc4aa1, and everything went very smooth again ; it takes at most
1 second to get an xterm with the prompt ready, and ps responds immediately. So
I think that there are two things here:
  - those who experience very long hangs may use a heavy window manager
    which does continuous disk accesses (I mean it accesses the disk for any
    simple operation).
  - a hungry WM may also be swapped during such operations, rendering it
    totally unusable, particularly if the swap is on the same physical disk
    as the file being written to.
So, could the people who report long hangs retry with swap disabled ?
Can we limit the amount of memory consummed by the cache during such a write ?
Regards,
Willy
