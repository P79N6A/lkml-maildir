Which is somewhat arbitrary a value. order-1 is costly compared to
order-0...
After running my system here for a while and doing various things
with it, I have the ability to allocate 898 order-0 pages (3592K),
or 36 order-3 pages (1152K).
Not as bad as I expected, but the system's only been up for an hour,
and not exactly doing anything unusual (and it has nearly 30MB free,
out of 4GB).

And that SLAB still works quite well :)
