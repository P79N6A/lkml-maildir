SUSv2 does; see

You're referring to CLONE_THREAD and friends, I think.
I don't know, but here's what a bit of google searching finds:
In 2.4-test8-pre1, Linus added a first cut at thread group support.
In March '01, someone summarized progress so far:

%40calypso.engr.sgi.com
In Oct '01 there was a brief thread indicating further progress:
http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&selm=linux.kernel.E15qcwe-00010e-00
%40the-village.bc.nu
In Nov '01, IBM released a pthreads implementation for 2.4.9 or later that
uses CLONE_THREAD:

I don't know what the glibc team has done in this area.  Maybe they
are waiting to see how the IBM approach pans out?
