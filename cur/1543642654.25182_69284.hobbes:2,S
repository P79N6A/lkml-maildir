It only seems like a big deal if you get out your microscope and focus on
the fork times.  On the other hand, look at the sh times: the rmap setup
time gets lost in the noise.  The latter looks more like reality to me.
I suspect the overall performance loss on the laptop has more to do with
several months of focussing exclusively on the needs of 4-way and higher
smp machines.
