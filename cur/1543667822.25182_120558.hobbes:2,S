I booted without amd76x_pm today and the problems are gone. I tried
notsc yesterday and dmesg said TSC had been deactivated on both CPUs. No
libc6 problems - debian is using the i386 version by default.
Oddly enough the system still crashed on those two for (;;) time(); test
loops posted earlier in this thread. So the only (unsatisfying) solution
I see for now is to keep the CPUs glowing hot for the sake of stability.
Any idea what else could cause the crashes in the absence of TSC usage?
As a yet unresolved side note I am still unable to execute the first
test program with my default user (immediately exits with retval 1).
Being run as root or as the system test user, the program runs as
expected (including crash with amd76x_pm). ldd shows no difference. Same
shell being used.
With kind regards,
