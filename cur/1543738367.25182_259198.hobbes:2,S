I would prefer fixing the IOCTLs in include/linux/videotext.h. These definitions
are older than the _IO macros in linux/ioctl.h AFAIK. So it is clear that they 
can't conform to that definition. I would prefer redefining them with respect
to the arguments passed to the IOCTLs.
This would be a little step towards unifying the kernel. Implementing a private
usercopy in saa5246a.c and saa5249.c would be the opposite. 
The concept with the _IO() macros is good and helps preventing errors in the
use of IOCTLs. So also the videotext drivers should use it.
Nevertheless there is one big disadvantage: The userspace programs 
have to be recompiled because they of course have to use the same IOCTL 
definitions. 
Nevertheless, affected are only saa5246a.c and saa5249.c. I think that there
are not many people left in the world using these drivers. So I think we can
afford to make a break here.
Do you agree? If so then I will work out a patch.
