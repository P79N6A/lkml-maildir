struct file_operations pcmk_fops requires the owner

At line 784, where do you get your open()? From the
'C' runtime library in user-space?
At line 791, where do you get your read() function?

At line 802, where do you get your close() function?
Ditto.
The correct way to put the contents of files into
your driver is with a ioctl() control function that
gets data from user-space files and puts it into
the proper place(s) in your driver.
