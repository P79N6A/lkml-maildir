The console will automatically and immediately grab the new keyboard and
everything will continue to work, even X, because it uses the console
for input.
Later, when X uses the event interface, it'll get a notification that
the keyboard was removed and added again, which will cause it to open
the new one, so all will be OK, too.

I don't think there is a problem with just reconnecting. It's extremely
unlikely that the set can change, too, because everyone uses translated
set 2, and that's the lowest common denominator.
Unless you specified extra arguments on the kernel command line, you
can't get any other set.
