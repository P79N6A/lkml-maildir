Hi Lists,
The Register has an article about the Linux compatibility layer
for Unixware.
The article claims
http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/1/12733.html
quote> SCO's Juergen Kienhoefer tells us that by mapping clone processes
quote> directly onto UnixWare's native threads, huge performance gains

to

Somehow I doubt this. I could believe that the glibc pthread layer
causes a lot of overhead for the thread creation, but I cannot
imagine that they get clone 1000 times faster than the Linux kernel.
Comments?
Joerg
