There's no kernel-source RPM on recent Fedora.  Also, there's another problem...
On my laptop at the moment:
% rpm -q kernel
kernel-2.6.16-1.2215_FC6
% uname -r
2.6.17-rc4-mm3
Did you want the vendor kernel source, or the running kernel source?
Might want to look at the symlink at /lib/modules/`uname -r`/source which
is probably as sane as it gets... (Though admittedly Fedora points it
into the wild blue yonder of /usr/src/kernels/`uname -r` which isn't
where the non-existent kernel-source RPM puts it.  Getting the .src.rpm
and working from there leaves it in /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/yadda-yadda....)
