Sure:  libata is a library, so all functions are helpers.  It's just one 
more helper function.

That's intentional, see below.

Ah the perils of an undocumented API :)  You're misunderstanding 
->port_stop.
That's a bug in ahci:  port_stop should never touch the hardware. 
port_stop is only for releasing per-driver resources like kmalloc or DMA 
memory.
Note...  another thing to keep in mind is that all libata drivers use 
ata_pci_remove_one() because that makes it possible to smooth over the 
differences between 2.4 and 2.6 scsi drivers.

I don't see any problems, given what I just wrote above.
Just the annoyance of individually mapping and unmapping 4 or 5 PCI 
BARs, and mixing 4 ranges of ISA legacy ioports for good measure.
Now...  addressing the overall theme of your message...  eventually 
libata wants to move to a strict port_{start,stop}, host_{start,stop} 
mechanism where the driver does more of the heavy lifting [by providing 
hooks that call libata helpers, rather than a helper calling hooks as 
ata_pci_remove_one does now].
But to get there will take _many_ iterations, since two things get in 
the way there:
* 2.4 compat
* the necessity to issue several ATA commands before we can respond to 
-any- SCSI commands
