I would like to say the same. I worked with the fixed kernel
2.5.3-pre1+ata-253p1-2 yesterday w/out problems. I rebootedt the machine
before leaving the office yesterday night and this morning it had a full

hda: lost interrupt
hda: lost interrupt
hda: lost interrupt
hda: lost interrupt
hda: lost interrupt
I have to say that something like :

All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy ...
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy ...
