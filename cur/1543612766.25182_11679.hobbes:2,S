I think it depends on whether the slab allocator manages memory by cpu or
node. Since the number of cpus per node is rather small (<=8) for
most NUMA systems, I would expect the slab allocator to manage by node.
Managing by cpu would likely add extra fragmentation and no real performance
benefit.

But this is already true for the page allocator (alloc_pages_node()).
The page pools are managed by node, not cpu. All memory on a node is
managed by a single pg_data_t structure. This structure contains/points-to
the tables for the memory on the node (page structs, free lists, etc). 
If a cpu needs to allocate local memory, it determines it's node_id.
This node_id is in the cpu_data structure for the cpu so this is an easy
calculation (one memory reference). The nodeid is used find the pgdata_t struct
for the node (index into an array of node-local pointers, so again, no offnode
references).
Assuming the slab allocator manages by node, kmem_cache_alloc_node() & 
kmem_cache_alloc_cpu() would be identical (exzcept for spelling :-). 
Each would pick up the nodeid from the cpu_data struct, then allocate 
from the slab cache for that node.
