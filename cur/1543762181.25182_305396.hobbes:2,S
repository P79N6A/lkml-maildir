The number of processes is counted per user, but CPU time and memory
consumption is counted per process.
Going around RLIMIT_CPU is too easy by simply forkbombing. This
renders RLIMIT_CPU unusable.
The memory limits aren't good enough either: if you set them low
enough that memory-forkbombs are unperilous for
RLIMIT_NPROC*RLIMIT_DATA, it's probably too low for serious
applications.
Now what about per-user (or per-session) CPU and memory limits?
Another idea: RLIMIT_FORK (number of allowed fork() calls in that
session). While that may not be useful for interactive login sessions,
I can imagine several situations where it could help (like qmail child
processes).
