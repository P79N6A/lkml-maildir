program: mkisofs
kernel: 2.4.4-2.4.25, 2.6.4-2.6.6
(To say it in other words, i never (seen/felt) a difference in 3 years.
So if there is a difference i just didn't realized there is one)
The current kernel is 2.6.5 as 2.6.6 sometimes just "hangs"
Just throw together some lage files (My files are all >= 350MB, the
"typical" case is about 4-5files with 800-1000MB each) and then
mkisofs -J -r -o <image> <source-dir>
I store the image files on another HDD to get best possibel throughput.
My HDDs (these are "normal" IDE-HDDs) are capable of delivering about
35-40MB/s, the last time i measured i got about 70MB/s aggregated
throughput while creating an image-file.

Real Programmers consider "what you see is what you get" to be just as 
bad a concept in Text Editors as it is in women. No, the Real Programmer
wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated, 
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
