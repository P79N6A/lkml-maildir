Peter,
The water is warm, get wet!
As far as Promise, I am working on a contract w/ their development group
to solve all of these issues for good.
I find it interesting that 2.4.16 is rock solid.
Since I am still picking up the pieces and sorting out patch trees, if you
have a copy of that patch and would send it back my way. It will go a long
way to solving the mystery.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
