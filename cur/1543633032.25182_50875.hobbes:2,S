well, that's not bdflush_min, that would be better called
bdflush_interval like I did in my patch, the bdflush_min is confusing
with the min values for the bdf_prm. btw, my way is actually some cycle
faster than the above, I don't like very much gratuiotus wasted cycles
with no gain in design. It's just the c++ cycle-wasteful mania that
everything is a method and that data sturctures have to be hidden and
not to be seen. But here I don't see any real gain to hide the
internals, such a data structure is basically known even from userspace.

to export to modules, right, I don't use it as module so I didn't
noticed. Oh well, it's too late now to update. I will upload a new one
tomorrow if I find the time or it will wait one week.
thanks for noticing,
Andrea
