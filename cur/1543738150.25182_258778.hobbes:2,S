Al summed it up quite well earlier. Jeff probably wants to get the
lining on his tinfoil hat thickened to avoid the brain lazers getting in
any further. Check those bushes for Novell snipers too - you never know
when they'll pop out and come to get you, like everyone else everywhere.
50,000USD is a patheticly small amount to pay for the kernel, there's
nothing wrong with the current licensing model, and people already make
big bucks from Linux. Several of those aren't just dot-coms that went
tits up later either - and most of them emply core kernel hackers.
Cheers,
Jon.
