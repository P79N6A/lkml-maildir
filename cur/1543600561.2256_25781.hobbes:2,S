Hm! Is this a UP or SMP kernel?

Hm. I've had one other bug report which initially seemed to be
devfs-related, but it was also related to the floppy driver as
well. IIRC, elsewhere Alan noted there seemed to be some problems with
the floppy driver. I suspect the bug you (and the other person) are
having is related to the floppy driver and not devfs.
Please try renaming/removing your floppy driver and see if the problem
persists. I bet it goes away. As Al mused, it was odd that the problem
only appears now. While there are known races in devfs, no-one has
ever encountered these in real life (targetted exploits are not "real
life"). So I too am surprised that suddenly there appears a problem
with devfs.
In the meantime, my tree is getting closer to the stage where I will
attempt a compile. Soon I will be able to dispel this dark cloud of
"devfs races" that Al keeps muttering about :-)
