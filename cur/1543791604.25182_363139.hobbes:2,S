I suspect the capping may well be from some old HIGHMEM interaction on x86 
(ie "don't keep half a gig free in the normal zone just because we have 
16GB in the high-zone". We used to have serious balancing issues, and I 
wouldn't be surprised at all if there are remnants from that. Stuff that 
simply hasn't been visible, because not a lot of people had many many GB 
of memory even on machines that didn't need HIGHMEM.
