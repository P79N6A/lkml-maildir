 "I'd like to know how much petrol is in my car."
 "Go fill it up and I'll tell you."
That's not the ideal answer. The ideal answer is for the MPEG decoder to know 
how large a timeslice it's going to get, and to adjust its playback quality 
accordingly. Or at least know the _minimum_ timeslice, then be able to use the 
extra time efficiently if it happens to get any extra.
Setting it to real-time priority will allow you to guarantee that it's going 
to get all the CPU time it desires, but that's a limited solution, and not 
necessarily the right one - those other processes might actually have 
something important to do.
There are operating systems which attempt to handle such things, but I doubt
that Linux is going to do so for the foreseeable future. 
The best you can do is make the MPEG decoder react appropriately after the
event - tune its behaviour to reflect the amount of time it's had recently. 
That's not as good as knowing in advance, but it's far more achievable.
