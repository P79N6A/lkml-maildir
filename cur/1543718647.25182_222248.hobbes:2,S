That uses if_nameindex, right? It's also affected by kernel version.

As I said, when I tried SIOCGIFCONF, results varied..
I think it's slightly more reliable to just keep using /proc/net/dev for
now. (My parser is more robust than viro's ;))
I took a look at the net-tools ifconfig source and saw that it also
parsed /proc/net/dev to pick up what SIOCGIFCONF didn't. Shudder.
