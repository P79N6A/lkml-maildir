Yes, i've looked at Alan's Documentation stuff.  And as always, Alan's
work is absolutely excellent -- however, what's really needed is
something like NT puts out with their IFS Kits, a sample VFS code
example for a NULL file system for folks who are porting to Linux. 
Would cut down on time along with an "oh shit" list of interface issues
to watch out for.  Richard Gooch did a decent job on the vfs.txt file
(it was better than nothing).  We need more though to get on par with
NT.
