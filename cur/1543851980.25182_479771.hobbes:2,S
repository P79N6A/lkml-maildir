I haven't updated link powersave patch yet.  Core implementation was 
agreed on but interface hasn't been decided yet.  Maybe it's about time 
to add /sys/class/ata_{host|device}/.  So, the patchset is pushed back 
for the time being.

If I understood correctly, the high power consumption of ahci controller 
can be solved by dynamically turning off command processing while the 
controller is idle, which fits nicely into link powersaving, right?  So, 
I think full-fledged leveled dynamic PM would be an overkill for this 
particular problem, but then again, maybe the correct way to implement 
link powersaving is via leveled dynamic PM.  I'll give it more thoughts.
Thanks.
