Hey Frank/Greg/Gerd,
on 
http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net/driver-zoran/linux-zoran-driver.patch.gz
you'll find a new patch which updates the kernel zoran driver to the
newest version in the repository. It's updated against the i2c changes
between 2.5.66 -> 2.5.67. Besides that, no changes since the last try.

Thanks,
Ronald
