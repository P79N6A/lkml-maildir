Good point.
If the device driver tries to allocate resources again (in the kdump
kernel),
which have been allocated before (in the crashed kernel) the hcalls will
fail because from the hypervisor view the resources are still in use.
Currently there's no method to find out the resource handles for these
HEA resources allocated by the crashed kernel within the hypervisor...
So we have to trigger a explicit deregister in the hypervisor before the
driver
is started again.
How do you recommend we should trigger this in the kdump process?
Is placing a hook into a ppc_md.machine_kexec be an option?
Gruss / Regards
