I don't think you understand how CONFIG_COMPAT works.  x86-64 defines it
when it wants it:
config COMPAT
        bool
        depends on IA32_EMULATION
        default y
just like every other architecture.  Just use
#ifdef CONFIG_COMPAT
	... 32bit compat code ...
#endif
and everything will be fine.  Please don't introduce this stupid
unnecessary LSI_CONFIG_COMPAT.  That just makes people say "what the
fuck are they doing?".

So you can only copy to the bottom 4GB of user address space?  That
seems like a recipe for disaster.  Particularly on ia64.

himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
