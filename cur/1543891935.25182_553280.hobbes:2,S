Sorry - but I really do not get your point here.
Are you trying to say that current cleanpatch is not good enough
or do you propose a new script to do something similar?
We do not want everyones favorite patch preprocessing script
in the kernel. So the only option is to incorporate changes in
cleanpatch.
If on the other hand you are proposing a script to clean whitespace
damage in the code then git already does this nicely.
I do not recall the actual receipt but searching the git mailing list
should reveal it. So for whitespace cleanup we should use git but maybe
via a small helper script.
