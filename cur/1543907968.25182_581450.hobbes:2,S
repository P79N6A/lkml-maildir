We can do it in C, like this:
-#define atomic_read(v) ((v)->counter)
+#define atomic_read(v) (*(volatile int *)&(v)->counter)
By casting it volatile at the precise piece of code where we want to guarantee a 
read from memory, there's little risk of the compiler getting creative in its 
interpretation of the code.
Stay tuned for the patch set...
