Thanks for the feedback, Andrew.
Two points you made that I now agree with:
 * Better that this code uses existing arch-dependent bitops,
   than that it have code pretending to be generic hiding
   additional arch specific dependencies.
 * Having just realized that the other existing include/bitmap.h
   calls take a count of bits, not bytes, I now agree with you
   and Joe that it should be bit counts.

Good - I'm on solid ground there ;)

ok
