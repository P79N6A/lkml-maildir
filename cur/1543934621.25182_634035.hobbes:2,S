Ingo/Andrew have been accepting patches to systematically remove all the
fastcall annotations from the kernel, so adding them back isn't going to
help.
Ingo and I discussed whether we need to reannotate paravirt.h (either
with fastcall or something else indicating a register-only calling
convention), specifically because of the -pg issue, but I think the
conclusion was that whatever problem existed no longer does, and there's
no incompatibility between -pg and regparm.
