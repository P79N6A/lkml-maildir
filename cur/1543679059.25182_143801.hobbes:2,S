I've got this exact same problem on 2.5.73-bk5.  Connection gets dropped 
just after a connection.  When I switch back to a previous kernel everything
works fine.  Setup is
        PAP authentication
        56K v.92 modem connection over USB serial connection
        UP kernel on P4 1.8 GHz
Let me know if there's anything else I can check.
