-bk7 (which I currently rebooted in) is okay.
-bk9 at first try got me to the login prompt, logged in, ran startx...
 frozen with the black background before seeing anything.
Second try hung well before, at the point where it switches the
 radeonfb on.
Only cure is to keep the power button pressed for 10".
Will try building -bk8 (which is currently running on my
 old desktop K7-800) and report...
