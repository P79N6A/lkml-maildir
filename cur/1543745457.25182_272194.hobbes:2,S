It's possible, but I don't see why that's a problem.  If it can get
more memory it's OK.  If allocation fails, then the write() will fail
with ENOMEM, if OOM killer get's to work and kills the FUSE process,
then write will return with ENOTCONN or something like that.

That only reads pages and never writes them.  It's just like malloc,
but prefilled with the file contents.
