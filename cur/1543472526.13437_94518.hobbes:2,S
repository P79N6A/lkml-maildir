Try before claim such things. 1.88Mb format is NOT compatible with any
standard format on low level (there are 1K sectors to start with :-). So
mk2efs will hanghs exactly the same way as in my experiment. fdformat will
work of course.

I have 5" 1440k disks and I'm could mount them as /dev/fd1H1440 just fine.
mke2fs works with them just fine if I use /dev/fd1H1440 and does not work
when I refer them as /dev/fd1h1200 !!! BTW 5" 720k disks could be ACCESSED
with /dev/fd?h720 but NOT CREATED from 360k or 1.2M disks not via
fdformat /dev/fd?h720 nor with mke2fs /dev/fd?h720 !!! Both commands will
just hungs !

Yes, suffixed version just says: "no, autodect will fail for this drive -- do
not try it". Suffixed version could not magically reformat drive (fdformat
could and here suffixed versions are helpful since autodetect will fail here :-)
but could just say to kernel: "no there are not 18 sectors for track but only 9".
Kernel will happily use only 9 first sectors then. Floppy will look like 720K
floppy afterwards but still there are will be 18 sectors for each track (9 of
them not used). This is not a case for 1.88Mb drive vs 1.44Mb drive (different
sector sizes) nor for 1.2Mb drive vs 360K drive (different number of tracks).

VERY RELEVANT -- see below. DOS format could change format of media if needed.
mke2fs COULD NOT ! NEVER ! Interpretation of format for already formatted media
could be changed (sometimes successfull, sometimes not) but reformating will
NEVER occurs.

Yes. It was EXACTLY what I'm want: two DIFFERENT, INCOMPATIBLE formats but
for the same physical media ! This is needed as countersample for your
stupid theory about magic format while mke2fs ...

Yes, I know. But this will not prove ANYTHING about initial claim !!! If there
are compatible options then reformating is not needed !

You are joking. Yet again:
-- cut --
[root@localhost /root]# fdformat /dev/fd1h360
Double-sided, 40 tracks, 9 sec/track. Total capacity 360 kB.
Formatting ... done
Verifying ... done
-- cut --
What's the difference between /dev/fd?h360 and /dev/fd?d360 ??? You are joking !
This is just mean: high-density floppy formatted for 360k and double-density
drive formatted for 360k !!! (Why the difference ? Oh. Long story. There are
difference in coercive force for different types of floppies :-)
Just standard 2.0.34 kernel from RedHat 5.1 (I'm use some 2.1.x kernel usually
but specially for testing I'm reboted with this old one :-)
Here was you point: mk2efs could format drive. This is HORRIBLE wrong. I am
have physical media (5" disk :-) which could be formatted by two different
incompatible low-level format versions: as h1200 and as h360 (d360 will work
as well -- just information will be kept safely on disk for less time :-).
If mk2efs could format media (this was your initial claim and start of
discussion) then this should not lead to any problems. This is not a case:
if disk is formatted as h360 (via fdformat) mke2fs works, if disk is formatted
as h1200 (via fdformat) then mke2fs hangs horrible. What this means ? Just one
thing: mke2fs will not format disk ! NEVER !
