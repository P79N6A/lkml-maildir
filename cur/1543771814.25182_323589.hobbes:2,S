  I am not particulary proud of the way I've modified the IDE driver 
but, to defend my ass a bit, the structure of __ide_do_rw_disk() was a 
little bit awkward to add FUA support as it first loads all address 
registers and then looks what to execute, and I didn't want to load 
taskfile registers only to abort the command.
  Currently none issues FUA READs, so the rq_data_dir() test can go away 
but I think it's just nice to have it there for completeness.  As the 
whole test is invoked only when blk_fua_rq() is true, I don't think the 
overhead will be anything accountable (or reducible).  And for the 
following select.b.lba and lba48 tests, we actually only need the lba48 
test but I wasn't really sure whether lba48 implies select.b.lba.  It 
seems it currently does but I couldn't find anything that guarantees it 
by design.  Bartlomiej, is it safe to skip select.b.lba test?
  I'll try to make it look better.  If you have any ideas, please let me 
know.

  will do.
  Thank you a lot.
