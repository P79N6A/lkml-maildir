It didn't work, and the bug still exists in 2.6.23-rc1: the resolution 
is wrong by 6 pixels. The user does have CONFIG_FIRMWARE_EDID enabled.
So far the only known working setups since 2.6.20.11 are:
  1. Zwane's patch reverted
  2. Jan's patch applied (to 2.6.22 or lower, I guess it no longer works 
for 2.6.23)
Here is dmesg output from 2.6.23:

Let me know how we can help diagnose this further.
Thanks,
Daniel
