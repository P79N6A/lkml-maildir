Once again,
I do not care about resources on Client side (Apache/PHP). My concern is
Server side (MySQL).  MySQL will close connection after timeout, which
is normally large (hours) to support interactive clients, or when it is
informed socket is closed.   This last part is getting very delayed,
300+ seconds for some reason.

I'm not speaking about   HTTP server in this case at all but about
Apache/PHP to MySQL  part only.  
It is quite typical for each page load to establish connection so we can
end up with pretty large number of connections. 
To be honest I can't truly explain exactly when this happens - in many
cases I can see connections  closed on the server as soon as client
closes them, in other cases they are dangling for quite a time.
