I assume there is no generic APM support for lid-close?
My BIOS (P100 DEC CTS5100 Hinote VP) has no way to do anything other
than beep, when the lid is closed, so I'm using a hack that polls the
ct65548 video chips registers to find when the BIOS turns the LCD off,
so I can do whatever.
Or is there a better wya?
