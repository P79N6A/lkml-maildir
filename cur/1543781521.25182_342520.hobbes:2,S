Just wanted to let you know that I'm not ignoring your comment :).  I'm
checking now to see if the firmware is required to make the slot number
unique across all controllers.  I also am expecting a hardware/firmware
update for the machine that exhibited this behavior, and so will retest
when I get it and let you know.  although, I'm not sure if it's a good
idea to trust the BIOS to do this properly even if it's required.
