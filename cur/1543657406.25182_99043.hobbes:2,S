	In general, changes that cause the system to become less efficient as load 
increases are not such a good idea. By reducing timeslices, you increase 
context-switching overhead. So the busier you are, the less efficient you 
get. I think it would be wiser to keep the timeslice the same but assign 
fewer timeslices.
