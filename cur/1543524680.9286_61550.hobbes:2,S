Arjan,
I do have this specified in my .config. It seem to be having some type of
file access problems with the 2.2.14 kernel since the other problem (which
apparently pervents me from executing a shell) is access related. 
Feb  5 14:22:51 localhost rc: Starting local succeeded
Feb  5 14:22:52 localhost gdm[466]: gdm_auth_secure_display: Could not unlink /var/gdm/:0.xauth file: No such file or directory
Feb  5 14:23:19 localhost PAM_pwdb[473]: 1 authentication failure; (uid=0) -> root for gdm service
Feb  5 14:23:19 localhost prefdm[473]: Couldn't authenticate root
Feb  5 14:23:25 localhost PAM_pwdb[473]: (gdm) session opened for user root by (uid=0)
This time I've attached my 2.2.14 kernel config. Everything works fine with 2.2.5-15 (unfortunately I 
overlaid my prior config). 
Thanks,
