while i'm not kernel hacker, i agree with you because of same attitude
toward more platforms and older hardware (and M$).
while it is of course broader issue i think old/other/... HW is as
important as new one: while there are many HW-cutting-edge people (like
gamers, various experimentators, ...) there are also many people with
older HW just because such HW is able to handle their problems/tasks/...
at the end i say one thing: i will happily wait one year longer for
features which wont force me to upgrade HW than get new kernel quickly and
realize i can't use it (like new "stable" 2.2 tree - don't take it as
personal attack on devlopers - i'm happy i did not deploy it on our
production servers yet).
