Correct.  The current implementation is optimal.
It is necessary to have indirection since the target address can change.
I'm never going to use self-modifying code.
And it's a simple, one-instruction change.
  int $0x80  ->  call *%gs:0x18
That's it.  It's all implemented and tested.  The results are in the
latest NPTL source drop.  The code won't be available in LinuxThreads
since it requires a kernel with TLS support.
As far as I'm concerned the discussion is over.  I'm happy with what I
have now.  The additional overhead for the case when AT_SYSINFO is not
available is neglegable (and can be compiled-out completely if one
really wants), and in case AT_SYSINFO is available the code really is
the fatest possible given the constraints mentioned above.
