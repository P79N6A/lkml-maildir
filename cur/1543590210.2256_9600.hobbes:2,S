This is a different problem. Apparently the Linux client does not
invalidate its caches sufficiently often. The smb client should at least
do a "invalidate_inode_pages(inode);" when it notices that the file size
has changed.
It has code to do that in smb_revalidate_inode(), but it may be that
something else refreshes the inode size _without_ doing the proper
invalidation checks. Or maybe Urban broke that logic by mistake while
fixing the other one ;)
