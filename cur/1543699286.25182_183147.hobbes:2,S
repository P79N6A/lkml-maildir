Briefly, I tried the apic patch first, and found that there are no lockups so far; well it passed my grep tests and even a kernel compile =).  Then I tried your io_apic patch + apic patch.  With nmi_watchdog=1 "NMI:" in /proc/interrupts increments alot compared to nmi_watchdog=2 before (as much as the timer).  So I believe your two patches are more correct than the other two.  Especially the fact I can run with CPU Disconnect and not lock up just like windows ... for people that have windows (I dont have windows =) plus a probably working nmi_watchdog.

Thank Jesse
It is interesting that the lockup problems also occur with a single memory stick,
I have only tried dual sticks.
