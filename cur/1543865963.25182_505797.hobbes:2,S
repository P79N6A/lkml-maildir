In this case "different" goes into userspace .. So different could mean
userspace regression, which is something that we don't want. I have no
idea if any apps use /proc/interrupts , but it's possible since it's
been around for a long time.
The reason that I'm bringing it up at all is because people have ask me
"Why isn't my timer ticking??"

Your saying we can't remove it tho, if /proc/interrupts is not related
to timers why does the entry exist at all ? Your saying the LOC entry is
the new "timer" entry, but we still have the old "timer" entry ..
Getting confusing ..
It might be nicer to list all the registered clock event sources
in /proc/interrupts, with more descriptive names .. 
Why is it that HRT doesn't use the "timer" as a valid timer?
