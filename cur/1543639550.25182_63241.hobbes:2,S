Unbelievably, 3.1 doesn't remove empty loops either.
I think there's a case for a compiler flag, `-fremove-empty-loops'.
Empty loop delays aren't portable acrosss compilers in general.  If you
_really_ want an empty loop that must always work with GCC, it's easy
enough to write:
	for (i = 0; i < 100000; i++)
		__asm__ __volatile__ ("");
