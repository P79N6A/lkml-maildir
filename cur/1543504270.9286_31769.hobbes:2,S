hi,
i have compiled the kernel (RedHat 5.2) for multicast routing with options
ipforwarding,tunneling,multicast routing.
I installed the mrouted also.
When i am running the mrouted i am getting the error message
"setsockopt IP_MULTICAST_TTL 1: protocol not available"
how to overcome this?
Thank You
-Ramasamy.
