Sorry about the typo and misnaming for the test program.  I attached the correct version that prints the right labels.
The results I posted did not use NPTL.  (Presumably OpenMP wasn't targeted at NPTL either.)  I don't think that NPTL has any bearing on the underlying issues that I mentioned, though path lengths are probably a bit shorter.  It should also handle contention substantially better, but that wasn't tested.
I did rerun the test case on a 900 MHz Itanium 2 machine with a more recent Debian installation with NPTL.  I get 200msecs (20nsecs/iter) with the custom lock, and 768 for pthreads.  (With static linking that decreases to 658 for pthreads.)  Pthreads (and/or some of the other infrastructure) is clearly getting better, but I don't think the difference will disappear.
I don't have a Xeon with NPTL handy.  On an old PPro, the results were 1133 and 4379 msecs for custom and NPTL respectively.
