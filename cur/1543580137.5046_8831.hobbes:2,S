Subject: [META] proposal to set up digestifier for linux-kernel
After a hiatus from linux-kernel, I find that the lack of a digest on
the new server is a nuisance.  I'm thinking of setting up a Majordomo
digestifier, with the caveat that non-plaintext messages may have some
displaced bits.
Would there be an interest in this?
