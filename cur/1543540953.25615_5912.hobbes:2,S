Hmmmm... Do you have *only one* raid partitions on that drive or are there
other partitions in use (and checked) as well? 
If there is a /dev/md0 on /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sda2, /dev/sdb2
to check it will cause e2fsck to run on md0 and the sda2, sdb2 at the same
time, because it doesn't know its the same physical drive. This will lead to
a lot of head moevements (should get quite loud) and will slow down fsck
tremendously.
I changed my fsck to first check root, then my raids, and then -a (the
raids come back immediately as clean).
