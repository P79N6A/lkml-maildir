Andrew, 
I think he refers to the omnibook driver, that can be found at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/omke/
And it is needed for brightness/fan/temperature/buttons of omnibooks
or acer aspire laptops like mine.
Why do you not have it in the kernel and what can i do to get it in
the kernel, so that i do not need to patch or compile external for
everytime when I switch to a new kernel?
