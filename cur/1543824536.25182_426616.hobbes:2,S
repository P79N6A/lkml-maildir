I've considered, and very much doubt it; and if there are, they'd
have to be peculiar to anonymous, since they'd already have been
wrong for the vma_prio_tree cases.

No, even without this migration issue, I'd much rather have anon_vmas
inserted in the new list_add_tail way, matching the prio_tree direction.
It's asking for trouble to have opposite conventions there (and much
less surprising to insert child after parent than before).
