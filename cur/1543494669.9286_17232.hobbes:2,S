That's fine, but there is one huge but. First of all, with many
filesystems you simply *don't have* an invariant that would be preserved
across umount;mount, let along reboot and would fit into 64 bits.
For FAT-derived filesystems you don't have an invariant that would survive
_both_ remount and rename. There is nothing to do about that and no OS can
help here. Period.
What I am talking about is that we have different requirements for i_ino
lifetime and fhandle one. The method currently used by knfsd more or less
works with ext2 and other UNIX filesystems. For the rest it simply breaks.
I think that we should put the fhandle<->VFS object translation into
individual filesystems. For normal filesystems it would mean moving the
current knfsd code into VFS, exporting it and letting new methods call it.
Other filesystems may implement more appropriate versions themselves.
Do you have any objections against that? Notice that current code simply
doesn't work for non-UNIX filesystems (and maybe HPFS & NTFS).
