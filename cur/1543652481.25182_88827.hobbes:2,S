Probably should be.  I don't use AT_GID from memory, maybe somewhere
else in the kernel is.

This might be OK too, but in practice I don't think much will be in
moduleloader.h: asm/module.h only really defines struct
mod_arch_specific, which is embedded in struct module, and struct
module needs to be exposed for those inlines...
