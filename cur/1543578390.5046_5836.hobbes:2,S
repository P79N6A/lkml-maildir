Well in any case, the problem was solved by my turning off module
versioning.  Regardless of how and why.  All other things being equal
(as in the .config I provided) CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y produces the errors
reported (PCMCIA not working, and unix.o not loading) and when it is not
defined, everything works smoothly.
