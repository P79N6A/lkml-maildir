Subject: [PATCH 3/17] FRV: Drop unsupported debugging features
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/6/204

The attached patch drops support for debugging features that aren't supported
on FRV:
 (*) EARLY_PRINTK
	The on-chip UARTs are set up early enough that this isn't required,
	and VGA support isn't available. There's also a gdbstub available.
 (*) DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
	This can't be easily be done since we use huge static mappings to
	cover the kernel, not pages.
