I just updated it.

+6: Patch series
+===============
+
+a) When sending a series of patches, number them in the Subject:s thusly:
+
+	[patch 1/10] ext2: block allocation: frob the globnozzle
+	[patch 2/10] ext2: block allocation: wash the pizza
+	etc
+
+b) Some people like to introduce a patch series with an introductory email
+   which doesn't actually carry a patch, such as:
+
+	[patch 0/10] ext2: block allocation changes
+
+   Please don't do this.  There is no facility in the git tree to carry
+   changelog-only changesets such as this (or at least, we don't do that) so
+   the information in the introductory email will be lost.
+
+   So I end up copying and pasting your nice introduction into the
+   changelog for the first patch, so it gets into git.  I'll follow it with
+   the text
+
+	This patch:
+
+   and then I'll include the changelog for the first patch of the series.
+
+   It would be preferred if the patch originators were to do this.
+
+c) Try very hard to ensure that the kernel builds and runs correctly at
+   every step of the patch series.  This requirement exists because of
+   `git-bisect'.  If someone is doing a bisection search for a kernel bug and
+   they land upon your won't-compile point partway through the exercise, they
+   will be unhappy.
+
+d) If your patch series includes non-runtime-affecting things such as
+   cleanups, whitespace fixes, file renames, moving functions around, etc then
+   this work should be done in the initial patches in the series.  The
+   functional changes should come later in the series.
+
+   This is mainly so that reversion of problematic changes becomes simpler.
