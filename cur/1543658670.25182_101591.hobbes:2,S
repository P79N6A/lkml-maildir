Nitin,
I got a chance to run the NetBench benchmark with your patch on 2.5.54-mjb2 
kernel.  NetBench measures SMB/CIFS performance by using several SMB clients 
(in this case 44 Windows 2000 systems), sending SMB requests to a Linux 
server running Samba 2.2.3a+sendfile.  Result is in throughput, Mbps.  
Generally the network traffic on the server is 60% recv, 40% tx.  
I believe we have very similar systems.  Mine is a 4 x 1.6 GHz, 1 MB L3 P4 
Xeon with 4 GB DDR memory (3.2 GB/sec I believe).  The chipset is "Summit".  
I also have more than one Intel e1000 adapters.  
I decided to run a few configurations, first with just one adapter, with and 
without HT support in the kernel (acpi=off), then add another adapter and 
test again with/without HT. 
Here are the results:
4P, no HT, 1 x e1000, no kirq:	1214 Mbps, 4% idle
4P, no HT, 1 x e1000, kirq:		1223 Mbps, 4% idle,		+0.74%
I suppose we didn't see much of an improvement here because we never run into 
the situation where more than one interrupt with a high rate is routed to a 
single CPU on irq_balance.  
4P, HT, 1 x e1000, no kirq:	1214 Mbps, 25% idle
4P, HT, 1 x e1000, kirq:	1220 Mbps, 30% idle,			+0.49%
Again, not much of a difference just yet, but lots of idle time.  We may have 
reached the limit at which one logical CPU can process interrupts for an 
e1000 adapter.  There are other things I can probably do to help this, like 
int delay, and NAPI, which I will get to eventually.  
4P, HT, 2 x e1000, no kirq:	1269 Mbps, 23% idle
4P, HT, 2 x e1000, kirq:	1329 Mbps, 18% idle			+4.7%
OK, almost 5% better!  Probably has to do with a couple of things; the fact 
that your code does not route two different interrupts to the same 
core/different logical cpus (quite obvious by looking at /proc/interrupts), 
and that more than one interrupt does not go to the same cpu if possible.  I 
suspect irq_balance did some of those [bad] things some of the time, and we 
observed a bottleneck in int processing that was lower than with kirq. 
I don't think all of the idle time is because of a int processing bottleneck.  
I'm just not sure what it is yet :)  Hopefully something will become obvious 
to me...
Overall I like the way it works, and I believe it can be tweaked to work with 
NUMA when necessary.  I hope to have access to a specweb system on a NUMA box 
soon, so we can verify that.
