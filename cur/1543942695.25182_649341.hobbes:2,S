Thanks a lot.

I've just saw it.

I thought about asking you if I can modify the SPARC IOMMUs to do
allocation in every loop.
The reason why I need the allocation in every loop is that I also need
to fix the problem that IOMMUs allocate memory areas without
considering a low level driver's segment boundary limits.

As far as I know, all the IOMMUs except for SPARC allocate a free area
in every loop but if it's too expensive for SPARC, then we need to
find a different way to handle segment boundary limits.

Agreed though it's a very hard task.
