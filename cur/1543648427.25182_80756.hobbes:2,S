Oh, and now that I think about it there is a way to do it without even using
seq_file->private when you need state passed, just allocates a state structure
in seq_start and return it, keeping the pointer to the real object inside this
state structure, together with any other state you need, when the the list is
exhausted, just free the state structure and return NULL, or return NULL and
free the state struct in ->stop, like kernel/module.c:{s_start, s_stop} do, but
I think that what Neil do in NFS is OK, and better, so I'll use seq->private.
