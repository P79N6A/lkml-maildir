Subject: Common symbol support for 2.6 modules

I'm building a 2.6 kernel module from an object file that is compiled
without -fno-common. I have no source from that object file, so I can
not recompile it. Does someone have a patch to include common symbol
support in 2.6 kernels? Or can someone tell me in which kernel that
support has been first taken out? Or have the patch that removed the
support for common symbols?
Thank you.
Jan Pieter.
