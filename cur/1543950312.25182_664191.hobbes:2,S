My impression was that the problem occurs in GCC compiled code in the  
kernel itself, not in user space:
1. User space has direction flag set.
2. signal occurs
3. kernel code is entered
4. kernel code does string operation <boom>
Fixing this instance of the problem by changing GCC requires (at  
least) recompiling the kernel.
Changing the ABI for this seems like a pretty crazy solution to a very  
minor and easily fixable kernel bug.  Distros have control over what  
kernels they ship, they have absolute power to ensure this doesn't  
affect their users when running default kernels - without changing the  
compiler.
