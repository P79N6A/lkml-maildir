I do understand the level of the work-load, and obviously wouldn't want to do it completely on my own for ever, and if I did, the quality would not be very good.
However, my situation at the moment, is that I am a freelance "general Unix and PHP/MySQL programming bloke", without enough work.  I have time on my hands, and am quite happy to put some of it towards doing something like a Linux version of The Register, (excellent description of what I had in mind), in return for being able to say - "CV?  I don't need one, see 
http://foobar
 - that's me".
John.
