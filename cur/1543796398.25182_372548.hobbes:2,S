Subject: [2.6.15-rc2] 8139too probe fails (pci related?)

I have troubles getting my Surecom EP-320 X-R1 (8139B) network adapter 
to work under 2.6.15-rc2 (will try other version asap, first time 
installing linux on this particular machine).
8139too Fast Ethernet driver 0.9.27
PCI: Device 0000:01:0c.0 not available because of resource collisions
Trying to free nonexistent resource <0000d000-0000d003>
Trying to free nonexistent resource <fa800800-fa80080f>
8139too: probe of 0000:01:0c.0 failed with error -22
This also happens when using pci=routeirq or pci=noacpi. The driver in 
question is build as module. Machine is a (quite common) ASUS CUSL2 
(i815) running a PIII 800 MHz.
Full kern.log(s) and other files can be found at 
http://sukzessiv.net/8139/
 (to large to include them as attachment, it 
seems). Below are some lines that might be interesting..
PCI quirk: region e400-e47f claimed by ICH4 ACPI/GPIO/TCO
PCI quirk: region ec00-ec3f claimed by ICH4 GPIO
PCI: Unable to handle 64-bit address for device 0000:01:0c.0
PCI: Transparent bridge - 0000:00:1e.0
(..)
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 0 of device 0000:01:0c.0
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 3 of device 0000:01:0c.0
pnp: 00:03: ioport range 0xe400-0xe47f could not be reserved
pnp: 00:03: ioport range 0xec00-0xec3f has been reserved
PCI: Ignore bogus resource 6 [0:0] of 0000:00:02.0
PCI: Error while updating region 0000:01:0c.0/3 (fa800800 != 00000810)
PCI: Error while updating region 0000:01:0c.0/0 (0000d001 != 813910fc)
PCI: Bridge: 0000:00:1e.0
oh, and btw: 'lspci -vvvv' outputs "Capabilities: [10] #fc [8139]" in an 
endless loop to the console when displaying the info about 01:0c.0 
(RTL-8139).
any hints?
thanks and have a nice day
