Sure.  So we know that for every 63 metadata blocks in the journal, we
can be writing one journal descriptor.  That grows the size of the
transaction slightly, by a factor of 1/63.
But __log_space_left() is supposed to account for that:
	/*
	 * Be pessimistic here about the number of those free blocks which
	 * might be required for log descriptor control blocks.
	 */
	...
	left -= (left >> 3);
which reduces the estimate of "usable" space left by a full 1/8th, which
is way more than the upper bounds of the effect that the limited wbuf
size ought to have.
journal_extend() uses __log_space_left() too, so ought to have the same
protection.
Actually, I think I'll withdraw the NAK on this patch, because the
change has other benefits ---- it's going to be both a stack-usage and a
performance improvement to use a generous kmalloc()ed wbuf[] here.  But
I still can't see why it would fix the problem you're claiming it
solves.
