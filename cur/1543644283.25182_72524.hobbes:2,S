Hi all,
After solving the kernel compile problem earlier i tried to actually
run it and got a kernel panic which consisted of the following:
<-- snip a bunch of stuff that i didn't write down but similar to the
following line -->
[<C0228EDA>] [<C0227F49>]
Code: 89 42 04 89 10 68 01 00 00 00 c7 03 00 00 00 c7 43 04 00
<0> Kernel Panic: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!
In interrupt handler - not syncing
<-- end of output -->
I sent my kernel config in an earlier message today (subject Re:
problems building bzImage with 2.5.*) for those that need to see it.
