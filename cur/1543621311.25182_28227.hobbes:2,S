I have an IOCTL defined something like this:
	_IOWR (0xfe, (30<<3 + 0), __u8 [696])
I'm really passing in a structure of size 696 (does that matter)?
When I make the copy from user call:
       if ((ret = copy_from_user(&reqconf, arg, sizeof(reqconf)))) {
          printk("ERROR: copy_from_user returned: %i, sizeof(reqconf): %i\n",
                 ret, sizeof(reqconf));
          return ret;
       }
I see this printed out:
ERROR: copy_from_user returned: 696, sizeof(reqconf): 696
According to some docs I saw on the web, it should return 0, or the
number it has left to copy.  So, why does it have 696 bytes left
to copy??
Thanks,
Ben
