Expand task_struct for this one usage?  I don't think that's
worthwhile.
The whole code is written so there is no datastructure associated with
the kthread.  When something like kt_message is needed (to kill a
thread, for example), they grab the lock and use the static one.
This means that threads can exit without having to do cleanup.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
