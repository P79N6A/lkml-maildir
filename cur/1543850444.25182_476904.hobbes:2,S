Eh? It is no longer "experimental". It went to "known broken in
non-funny ways".
People normally use experimental features... (like cpu hotplug, acpi
hotkeys, intel 830m framebuffer, USB CATC ethernet, SDHCI, kernel
profiling) without expecting breakages. (Hmm, perhaps some of these
should not be marked experimental any more?)
I'd actually vote for removing MULTITHREAD_PROBE from kconfig,
temporarily, but I guess BROKEN is okay, too.
