Oh please.
The middle part is your vendor. My vendor was Red Hat. You can have
i386-sls-linux, i386-tamu-linux, i386-mcc-linux, or whatever.
The default would be "unknown", not "redhat".
That is just the way the system was originally designed. Your vendor
goes in the middle. If usefulness matters more than correctness, then
maybe i386-libc6.0-linux2.2 would be nice. I'm happy with that too.
Playing games to glorify St. Ignucious is not acceptable.
