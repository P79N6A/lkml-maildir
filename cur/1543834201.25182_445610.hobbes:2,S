Hi
I've recently subscribed to T-Mobile's 3G service for my laptop. I
found v little info on the card but heard a few success stories with
the Vodafone card with Linux.
Upon getting the card I've not realised my mistake and it appears that
it isn't as simple as I'd hoped.
Has anyone had any success with this card at all?
The lspci out put is:
04:00.2 Network controller: Option N.V. Qualcomm MSM6275 UMTS chip
        Flags: medium devsel, IRQ 17
        Memory at 52040000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [disabled] [size=2K]
04:00.2 0280: 1931:000c
pccard: CardBus card inserted into slot 0 is what dmesg says
And nothing appears under lsusb
I'd be grateful for any help anyone can offer because if I can't get
it to work I'll need to return it within the "cooling down" period
which is the next few days and be locked into an 18 month contract
Thanks again
Mike
