Anything you can do to make tester's life easier will always slightly
increase the number of testers. Hint: how often do you try random
software that requires that you first install CVS, SVN or arch just to
get it, compared to how often you try random software provided as tar.gz ?
Pre-release tar.gz and rpms coupled with a freshmeat announcement should
get you a bunch of testers and newcomers. This will give the new doc a
real trial, and will help discover traps in which beginners often fall.

I know it's a bit late to ask, but if new on-disk format changes, isn't
it time to bump the version to 2.0 ? It would be easier for many people to
remember that GIT 1.X uses format version 1 and that GIT 2.X uses format
version 2 with backwards compatibility with 1.X. I also think that 1.5
is much more different from 1.0 than a mid-term 2.0 would be from current
1.5.
That said, kudos for the nice changelog !

Willy
