Subject: [GIT PATCH] Fixes in the -stable tree, but not in mainline
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/17/114

Here are 5 patches that are in the -stable tree, yet not currently fixed
in your mainline tree.  One of them is a security fix, so it probably
would be a good idea to get it into there :)
Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/stable-2.6.git/
or from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/stable-2.6.git/
if it isn't synced up yet.
The full patch series will sent to the linux-kernel mailing list, if
anyone wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
