Not really.  Anything that requires an interrupt and/or bottom half is
potentially hosed when the machine is dying.  The only guaranteed way I
know of capturing an oops in a total machine crash is via a serial
console.  The serial console I/O runs in polled mode and any kernel
state, no need to worry about interrupts or bh scheduling.
OTOH, it would be nice to save some data in memory and pick it up on
reboot.  Does anybody know a guaranteed way of saving data in memory
across a soft reboot?  People have looked at this in the past but
AFAIK, nobody succeeded.
