before you blame smp, try the usual bp6 stuff:
*	bigger/better power supply
*	better cooling
*	boot with 'noapic' on commandline
search a linux-kernel archive (http://marc.theaimsgroup.com)
for more info.  these boards seem to be a bit of a lucky dip.  some
never have any problems, others have heaps.  i have a vague memory of
someone mentioning flaky caps on some revisions...  also are you using
the onboard ata66 controller?  there's been a fair few reports of
trouble with those, not sure if it was fixed/hacked-around or not.
best of luck,
j.
