In short, it's defined to be whatever AT91_MCI_TRTYP_MULTIPLE means in
the AT91RM9200 MMC host driver, which appears to be set for any of the
multiple block commands.  They currently are doing:
+static const u32 commands[64] = {
+       /* Class 1  (0) */
+       MMC_GO_IDLE_STATE,
+       MMC_SEND_OP_COND        | AT91_MCI_RSPTYP_48,
+       MMC_ALL_SEND_CID        | AT91_MCI_RSPTYP_136,
+       MMC_SET_RELATIVE_ADDR   | AT91_MCI_RSPTYP_48    | AT91_MCI_MAXLAT,
+       MMC_SET_DSR             | AT91_MCI_MAXLAT,
...
+       MMC_READ_SINGLE_BLOCK   | AT91_MCI_RSPTYP_48    | AT91_MCI_MAXLAT | AT91_MCI_TRDIR | AT91_MCI_TRCMD_START | AT91_MCI_TRTYP_BLOCK,
+       MMC_READ_MULTIPLE_BLOCK | AT91_MCI_RSPTYP_48    | AT91_MCI_MAXLAT | AT91_MCI_TRDIR | AT91_MCI_TRCMD_START | AT91_MCI_TRTYP_MULTIPLE,
...
+       MMC_WRITE_BLOCK         | AT91_MCI_RSPTYP_48    | AT91_MCI_MAXLAT | AT91_MCI_TRCMD_START | AT91_MCI_TRTYP_BLOCK,
+       MMC_WRITE_MULTIPLE_BLOCK| AT91_MCI_RSPTYP_48    | AT91_MCI_MAXLAT | AT91_MCI_TRCMD_START | AT91_MCI_TRTYP_MULTIPLE,
and using that as a lookup table by command for the value to put into
the command register.  I want to eliminate that, and not passing the
MULTI flag prevents elimination of this table.
