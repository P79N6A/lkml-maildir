By the "whole thing" I meant everything running in kernel mode. That is
the nanokernel, Linux and any linux module you load runtime. A simple
memory violation: crash. It doesn't help you verify that the nano-kernel
runs realtime when you haven't verifies that Linux kernel is without
bugs which can trash a nano-kernel like Adeos/RTAI (it seems not to be the
case of Iguana, which does use memory protection against Linux.)

 for our work.
Iguana seems to do it safe and make real
virtuallisation/compartmentisation. I have seen similar systems presented
before: Seperate your machine protection domains - both wrt. timing and
memory. Then you don't have to worry so much about what is going on in
there as long as you don't need the output for anything critical.
The nanokernels (most Adeos/RTAI) we were discussing up until now, isn't
doing that.

Similar, but not so: No memory protection is involved in Adeos.
Iguana can be formally verified. Adeos/RTAI can't because it needs
verification of the whole Linux kernel, which is very unrealistic.
Linux preempt and Adeos/RTAI can get to/is at the level where it is
"designed deterministically". I.e. it is deterministic under the
assumption there is no bugs, but neither can be formally verified.
I suggest we call Adeos/RTAI a nanokernel and Iguana a microkernel (the
above link you provided says so :-) to avoid confusion.
This thread is really interresting but is also getting very messy due to a
lot of incompatible termonology :-(
