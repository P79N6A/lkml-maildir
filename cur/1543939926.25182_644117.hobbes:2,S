On-Stream support has been long gone but it seems that deprecation
warning etc. managed to survive.
w.r.t. to the pipeline-mode: it should be pipelined into /dev/null
rationale:
- it is _very_ complex
- causes errors to be deferred till the next user-space access
- direct I/O using blk_rq_map_user() will offer superior performance
the only question is whether to remove it...

applied #1-6, #8-9, #11-20, #29, #31
#10, #24 and #25 are also fine but since they depend on other patches
I couldn't merge them immediately
#7 and #21 need some recasting
#22 should be deferred for now
#26-28, #30 and #32 are still to be reviewed
BTW what happend to patch #23?
Thanks,
Bart
