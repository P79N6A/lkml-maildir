James, why do you keep ignoring important points, written by me in that 
e-mail: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/30/178?
Namely:
1. Solid architecture of SCST is inherently more simple than distributed 
user/kernel space processing, when kernel behaves under control of user 
space, used in STGT, and allows to get better results with less effort. 
Better in all aspects: simplicity (hence, maintainability), reliability 
and performance. Linux once made step away from microkernel based design 
and that was for really good reasons.
2. Zero-copy operations with page cache will halve processing latency on 
high speed links, like InfiniBand, and it is impossible to implement 
that in a sane way with STGT approach, while for SCST it can be 
implemented simply and naturally.
