Hi,
If I understand things correctly, an open of a device with the driver
as a module now automatically increases the module use count. That's 
great!
So all "open" routines that contained nothing but
"inc_module_use_count" were removed. Great!
However, the SX and RIO drivers use a "misc" device to download the
firmware. The problem is that the "misc" driver returns "enodev" when
there is no "open" routine. So either we need to make it allow 
"misc" devices that don't have an open/close routine, or we have
to reinstate the open routines for the SX and RIO firmware devices.
The attached patch does just that. (If I remember correctly, Linux
usually assumes "no special open code" when "...->open" is NULL, so
I'd say that "misc" is wrong. But my guess is that someone ran into
SOME problem when this was changed. Maybe it has always been like
this.)
Anyway, this makes RIO and SX work again. 
				Roger.
