Yes it does.  Maybe not by that name, but it does set the bit.

This patch is definitely wrong (besides being line-wrapped).  Note that
EHCI_USBLEGSUP_OS is equal to (1 << 24) -- it makes no sense to use it
as an argument for a byte-sized write.  Also note that the two 
low-order bytes in the USBLEGSUP register are read-only; you shouldn't 
try to write them at all.
It looks like you are simply attempting to do what the previous line of 
code already does.
