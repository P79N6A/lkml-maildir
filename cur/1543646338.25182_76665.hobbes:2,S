I don't wish to comment on the need or lack thereof of exporting the sys call
table but it sounds to me that this is an area where some work would be
beneficial.
Is it too complication to produce a portable API along the lines of:
	syscall_entry_replace(int,func_t)
Which will be implemented per architecture with the appropriate locks ?
And if locking is the problem then even a trimmed version that doesn't do
locking and maybe could be used for other in kernel purposes in code where
the locking is not needed ?
Just wondering,
	Mark.
