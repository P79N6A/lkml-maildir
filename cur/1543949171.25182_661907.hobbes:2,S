This describes what you did, but not why you are doing this, making it a
pretty bad changelog comment.
Can you refresh my memory as to the "why" for all of this and how you
are handling machines that do not export this information at all?
oh, and don't put "extern" in a .c file, and call kobject_uevent in the
same function that you added the kobject in, unless there is a very good
reason to do so, otherwise you just missed all of those events...
thanks,
