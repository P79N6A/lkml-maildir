Newbies as me do care about documentation ;-) The Linux kernel is
getting more complex over time, and I appreciate some kind of
architectural docs to know more about the inner workings. Personally, I
don't have all the time I would like to explore and investigate, so a
50,000-feet-point-of-view and some detailed documentation about VM,
scheduler and net are welcome.
Kernel experts as you (Linus, Andrew, Alan, Russell, Jeff and many
others whose names I must leave out as I don't have space to name them
all) probably know the inner workings better than anyone as they work
with it every day, but people new to kernel hacking need some starting
point.

Well, some functions and variable names may seem readable and logical to
some, but it takes time for me to decipher some of them :-)
