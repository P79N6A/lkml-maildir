well.. kinda. One of the really hard parts of the submit/completion stuff is that
the slab/slob/slub/slib allocator ends up basically "cycling" memory through the system;
there's a sink of free memory on all the submission cpus and a source of free memory
on the completion cpu. I don't think applications are capable of working out what is
best in this scenario..
