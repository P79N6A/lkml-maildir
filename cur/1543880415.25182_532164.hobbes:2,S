Subject: [patch] cleanup cpufreq kconfig options
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/18/288

Adds proper lines to help output of kconfig so people can find the module names.
Also fixed some broken leading spaces versus tabs.
