The interesting question, of course, is: how is this different than the
policy currently being set by /proc? Where is the user-mode daemon
allowing me to change the layout of /proc/sys to a more appropriate
layout?

Like it or not, the names in /proc *are* policy, and kernel should not be
dictating policy. Therefore, the kernel should not be deciding what names
appear in /proc. Q.E.D.
