Subject: Problem:  CPU sleep when calling a function in another object for the first time.

Hello,
I have been seeing a problem in which one of my CPUs goes to sleep for
40ms in the middle of running a user-space program.  The problem occurs
when I have a function in object file X call another function in object
file Y.  If I add a gettimeofday right before the function call occurs,
and then also right at the beginning of the called function, I see a
40ms delay.  This only occurs on the first call to any function in file
Y.  Once a function in file Y is called, all other calls to functions in
this file are immediate.
I have added a kernel profiler to the timer interrupt of this CPU - and
find that during this 40ms period, the CPU is in r4k_wait - which looks
like cpu_idle is running.  It almost seems like file Y is being loaded
into memory to be used.
The program in question is using pthreads and each thread is on a
separate CPU.  Each CPU is dedicated to running a single thread and
nothing else.  The files X and Y are two object files linked into a
single ELF binary.  The kernel version is 2.6.14 and this is a MIPS
based processor.
Does anyone have any ideas why this delay might be occurring?
Thank you in advance,
John
