I don't think that CAP_SYS_ADMIN is proper capability for this:
CAP_SYS_ADMIN is catch-all that should be used only when no other
capability covers action being performed. In this case CAP_SYS_RESOURCE
seems to be a better fit, after all __vm_enough_memory() controls access
to a resource, plus file systems use CAP_SYS_RESOURCE to protect disk
blocks reserved for "root".
