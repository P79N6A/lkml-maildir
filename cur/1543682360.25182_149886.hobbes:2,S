We're looking at getting some seperate bandwidth for bkbits.net and 
turning on the patch feature of BK/Web.  Then you'll be able to do a
    wget 
http://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5/gnupatch@1.5234
and get something like the following.  I suspect this is better than
cvsps and it will work for all repositories on bkbits.net, not just 
the mainline one.  Is that good enough for what you want?  The format
below repeats for each file in the changeset.
