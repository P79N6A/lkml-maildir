No, I'm arguing AGAINST using BE.
I know there are folks out there who like BE, but let's just face it: the
PC platform is LE, and will stay so. Going to mixed-mode just because
misguided people like the old BE format is not an option I am willing to
entertain.
The computing world would be better off with just one byte order, that
byte order isn't going to be BE.
