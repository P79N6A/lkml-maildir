a system of that size has many "practical" applications. It *can* be done
without partitioning it into a tree hierarchy, however, you will need a very
capable interconnect (quadrics and myrinet come to mind). Tt that you'll have a
tiered switching hierarchy even if the nodes are presented in a flat layer.
IMHO nearly any level of breakout for grid computing (basically a cluster
hierarchy) starts to become interesting as a function of your app/problem size
and how many simultanous jobs you are running.
Of course, we can stop and hit reality for a second: not many people can afford
a 1024 cpu cluster, hence the proliferation of smaller ones ;)
