Hi Viro,
The 2.4 tests we did, also has fastwalk patch ported from 2.5. Though
fastwalk has performed better (throughput improved by 1%) than base 2.4 
but I think because of increased hold and wait times on dcache_lock, results
are not as good as using only dcache_rcu.

For 2.5 I tried to merge fastwalk and dcache_rcu but both doesnot seem
to compliment each other. fastwalk takes dcache_lock much earlier than
d_lookup. 
On 2.5 we get better results from dcache_rcu when we reomve
fastwalk and put the dcache code back to 2.5.10ish level of code. Probably
this is not the correct way as it involves lots of code changes and we need
to workout some other way. 
There are some numbers from 2.5.20-base vs dcache_rcu(no fastwalk) done by 
Anton Blanchard with dbench.
