Please stop being naive.
In case nobody told you: we are not living in a democracy here (in Germany),
but something that can best be qualified as party-oligarchy. This is why your
MoP is not interested at all in your "tolerance" of his voting. He does not
need you (or your vote) for making his living, he needs his party, and that's
it.

Stephan
