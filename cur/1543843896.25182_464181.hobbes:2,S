That is certainly interesting.  Intuitively, I would guess that having
the unplug per-process is going to slow down the case where multiple
procs are banging on the dirty list for multiple files (ie for heavy
memory pressure).  It feels like we're not going to merge as
effectively, but your tiobench test should have hit that.  Did you look
at elevator stats from the test?

Missed unplugs were a nasty problem.  We had a bunch of strange io
stalls and deadlocks without the implicit unplugging, and we also
managed to keep creating new ones as patches rolled into the block
subsystem.  I would really like to keep some kind of catchall implicit
unplug in there.
