I/O through generic_readpage() is page-granular and goes into the page
cache.  getblk() is for the buffer cache, which is block-sized.
Page cache is used to cache file pages.  Buffer cache is used
to store all metadata.  In future versions of the kernel, the buffer
cache will be used less and less, as things like directory entries are
moved into the page cache.
You probably want to start looking at the various kernel guides
and read up on the difference between the page cache and buffer
cache, that's the best place to start.
