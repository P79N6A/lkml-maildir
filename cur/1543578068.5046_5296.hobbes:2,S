	Well, I know I for one use a system that you might have heard
of called 'MOSIX'.  It's a (kinda large) kernel patch with some user-space
tools but allows for migration of processes between machines without
modifying any code.  There are some limitations (threaded applications and
shared memory and whatnot) but it works very well for the rendering work
we use it for.  We use radiance which in general has pretty little inter-
process communication and what it has is done through the filesystem.
	Now, the interesting bit here is that the processes can grow to be
pretty large (200M+, up as high as 500M, higher if we let it ;) ) and what
happens with MOSIX is that entire processes get sent over the wire to 
other machines for work.  MOSIX will also attempt to rebalance the load on
all of the machines in the cluster and whatnot so it can often be moving
processes back and forth.
	So, anyhow, this is just an fyi if you weren't aware of it that I
believe more than a few people are using MOSIX these days for similar
appliactions and that it's availible at 
http://www.mosix.org
 if you're
curious.
