Hi
This is interesting. I've never had a lockup with any kernel.
I wonder if it might be related to the type of uses the machine is put to.
My machine is a Dual PIII based of the intel GX chipset. It serves as
Workstation primarily but also does firewalling and acts as a gateway for my
other PCs. Mostly the load isn't too heavy but I do crank it up a lot when I
compile KDE and have several parts building at the same time.
