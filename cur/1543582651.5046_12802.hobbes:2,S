Hi,
I have investigated this problem further.  The hdparm
triggers the error but is not the cause.  hdparm accesses
/dev/hdb which is my cd-r drive.  This triggers the loading
of the cdrom and ide-cd modules.  Manually loading cdrom
succeeds, after which, manually loading ide-cd crashes the
system.  No need to even open() the device.  This works
fine with the VIA driver from 2.2.19pre14+ide-2.2.18-1221.
Regards,
Shane
