Subject: [PATCH RT] don't let printk unconditionally turn on interrupts

Ingo,
My first try at booting -rt8 on my machine crashed immediately.  No nmi,
no nothing. Just a lockup at the registration of the ACPI_PM timer.
This would happen every time, and after struggling for a while, I
finally found out why!
The printk in timeofday_periodic_hook that is called holding the
write_lock of system_time_lock (a raw_seq_lock) was causing lots of
havoc.  The printk would turn on interrupts, and then I would get a
deadlock when the interrupt would do a read on system_time_lock.
So here's the patch:
