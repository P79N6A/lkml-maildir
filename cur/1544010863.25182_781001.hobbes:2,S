HT got added back to Nehalem, so SMT is coming to you in every future x86 
CPU. It brings a serious performance win, so nobody will turn off SMT 
threading in practice. If SMT worries you, it needs explicit partitioning 
of security-relevant processing to different physical CPUs, via 
cgroups/cpusets/etc.
