Subject: [PATCH 30 of 31] xen: no need for domU to worry about MCE/MCA
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/18/17

Mask MCE/MCA out of cpu caps.  Its harmless to leave them there, but
it does prevent the kernel from starting an unnecessary thread.
