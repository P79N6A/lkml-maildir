It would probably be better to just save references to the tasks.
	struct cgroup_iter it;
	struct task_struct *p, **tasks;
	int i = 0;
	cgroup_iter_start(cs->css.cgroup, &it);
	while ((p = cgroup_iter_next(cs->css.cgroup, &it))) {
		get_task_struct(p);
		tasks[i++] = p;
	}
	cgroup_iter_end(cs->css.cgroup, &it);
	while (--i >= 0) {
		set_cpus_allowed(tasks[i], cs->cpus_allowed);
		put_task_struct(tasks[i]);
	}
The getting and putting of the tasks will prevent them from exiting or 
being deallocated prematurely.  But this is also a critical section that 
will need to be protected by some mutex so it doesn't race with other 
set_cpus_allowed().
