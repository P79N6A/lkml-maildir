I am using Debian's kernel-package [1], and did the usual procedure for
both kernels, that I usually do:
make-kpkg clean
make-kpkg --revision=3:today.0 build
fakeroot debian/rules kernel-image-deb
This procedure has resulted in a useable kernel .deb package for the
last 18 months, and has resulted in a useable kernel .deb package for
2.4.16 with non-modularized 8139too.

[1] which provides a comfortable way to produce self-contained .deb
packages including maintainer scripts that take care of modules,
System.map and the boot loader, from vanilla kernel sources. I repeat:
Using kernel package does not mean that vendor kernel sources are
used, the kernels are built with vanilla kernels from kernel.org.
