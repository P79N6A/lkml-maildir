Are you really sure this combination is supported at all ? Your distro
might be heavily relying on 2.6 extensions not present in 2.4 (lvm2, ...).
For instance, I remember that a time ago, some distros installed with
the DIRINDEX option enabled on all EXT2/EXT3 filesystems, which could
not be mounted by unpatched kernels because this option was not in
mainline.
