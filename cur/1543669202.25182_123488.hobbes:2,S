Subject: vfs level undelete support?

Would there be any interest in a patch that added undelete support to
the VFS.  the idea would be that when one unlink's a file, instead of it
being deleted, it is "moved" to "/.undelete/d_put path of dentry",
coupled with a daemon that manages the size (maintains a quota per uid
by deleting old files).
It would appear to be an easy CONFIG level option, as it would just be
do this, or normal unlink(), and would work for every fs, as well as not
needing and LD_PRELOAD.
It seems pretty simple to hack up, just wondering if there's any
interest?  
thanks,
shaya
