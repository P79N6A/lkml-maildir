You are right. But why add this patch, My laptop not crash when I enable block dump, So I try to find where is the Bug. Final, The bug is in sector_t, I was enable CONFIG_LBD, So sector_t is u64, So We have to change the code when enable CONFIG_LBD.
I'd like the 2.4 style so add count number into printf.
Here is the patch fix it
+
+   if (unlikely(block_dump)) {
+       char b[BDEVNAME_SIZE];
+       printk("%s(%d): %s block %llu/%u on %s\n",
+           current->comm, current->pid,
+           (rw & WRITE) ? "WRITE" : (rw == READA ? "READA" : "READ"),
+           (u64)bio->bi_sector, count, bdevname(bio->bi_bdev,b));
+   }
+
I think, also have this bug in 2.4.23, here is the patch for it, Hope can helpful.
