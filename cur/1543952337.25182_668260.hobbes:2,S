I think you've just tried to obfuscate the truth.  As you have
described, replication does not provide full protection against data
loss; it loses all changes since last cycle.  Recall that it was you who
introduced the word "replication", in the context of guaranteeing no
loss of data.  Then you ignored David's point about the relatively low
speed of networks, remarking only that mirroring is real-time.  Reading
between your words makes clear that "mirroring and replication" does
reduce the performance.  (You claimed microsecond-level transaction times.)

You've rather under-valued dependability, though.  Even your idea of
mirroring systems is incomplete, because failure of the principle system
requires transparent fail-over to the redundant system, which is
actually quite challenging, especially with commodity systems hobbled
together in the way you promote.  Remember that you claimed
microsecond-level transaction times, and 6-nines of availability.  The
former seems unlikely with replicated systems and, in the event of a
failure, you won't achieve the latter.
You still haven't investigated the benefit of your idea over a whopping
great buffer cache.  What's the point in all of this if it turns out, as
Alan hinted should be the case, that a big buffer cache gives much the
same performance?  You appear to have gone to a great deal of effort
without having performed quite simple yet obvious experiments.
