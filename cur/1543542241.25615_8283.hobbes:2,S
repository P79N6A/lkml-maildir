This is not a tough one:
pthread_raw_signals
            This call shifts delivered signal numbers up so that
   "special" POSIX signals can be delivered to a process. Sending signal N to 
    a thread that has executed this call causes the kernel to deliver
    signal N+SIG_RAWSHIFT.  So kill(pid,SIG_KILL-SIG_RAWSHIFT) is needed
    to hammer such a process.
Or:
    Make it a root pthread daemon.
Or: 
    Make SIG_KILL still work as usual, with the CLONE_PTHREAD flag
    causing all children to be killed too, but with SUSPEND etc 
    coming in raw.
