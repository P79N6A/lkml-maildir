Kind of.  Except Linus wrote the particular section of code in question.

Or perhaps not in the case of my hardware functioning properly one day,
and never to boot linux (but fine with everything else) again..
I need a sure fire way of testing whether the timer interrupt works,
perhaps even a kernel patch to include such a check before initialising
the timers.  Is there a possibility of working around such problem?  I
would rather destroy this motherboard than sacrifice it to running
inferior operating systems for the remainder of its life. =)

Dave.
