This will break the "color_map" sysfs file for framebuffers -
drivers/video/fbsysfs.c:store_cmap() expects to get exactly 4096 bytes
for a colormap with 256 entries.  In fact, the original patch which
changed PAGE_SIZE - 1 to PAGE_SIZE:
http://kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=9d9d27fb651a7c95a46f276bacb4329db47470a6
was done exactly for use with that "color_map" file.
This patch also does not completely guarantee that the buffer will be
null-terminated.  A program may first call read() on the sysfs file,
which will allocate buffer->page and invoke ->show to fill that page;
then subsequent write() on the same file will reuse buffer->page.  To
get really bad results, you need to have ->store which assumes
null-terminated buffer together with ->show which writes to the last
byte of the page (which is probably rare, but show_cmap() does exactly
that).
