For stable kernel series yes. And they should be frozen a bit before
the first n.foo-pre release so that stuff can be checked over and solidified

I had a lot of the same problems trying to get stuff sorted with you for 2.2.x
though, and that is a stable API and a basically sound kernel. The pci_netif
stuff broke spectacularly on it, with cards appearing 8 times and the like.
I switched to Andrey Savochim's eepro100 driver because it actually worked
and he was fixing the bugs people were reporting. I try on the whole to keep
close to your drivers (pre netif anyway) but they have bugs in them that just
aren't getting fixed - the 21041 + modern tulip problem, the 3c590 8K hang
under load (all driver revs >0.49!) and the eepro100 hangs.
That tells me several things - as Jeff can now testify network cards are evil
buggy little contraptions. If the bugs aren't getting fixed then we need more
people beating on those drivers and hacking them

Lots of driver people work against the stable kernel - but in SMALL updates.
That is one of the important things.

No the official advice os to run the latest pre release stable kernel.
