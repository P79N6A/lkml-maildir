There is of course a difference, but is it big enough that they deserve 
different APIs? Just look into <linux/timer.h> it doesn't mention timeout 
once, but according to Thomas that's our "timeout API". Look at the 
description of mod_timer() in timer.c: "modify a timer's timeout".
It seems I'm not only one who thinks that both are closely related.

} "main usage" != "restricted to"
IOW I didn't say that "process timer" are restricted to processes, but 
it's their intended main usage. "kernel timer" are OTOH the first choice 
for any internal kernel time issues (which are not just timeouts).

This was the _only_ issue where he got into any detail, but I also 
mentioned later that this one of the minor issues.
Above was about the size of the ktimer structure and interval timer.

Then I must have missed something. Earlier he just quotes something from 
SUS without any explanation. His last answer was just about user 
expectations without any connection to the different resolutions at the 
kernel side I described in the mail before.
