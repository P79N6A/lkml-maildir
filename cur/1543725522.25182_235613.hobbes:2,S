Subject: Tracking down source of wrong interrupt 2.6.7.
I have an ITE raid card, which sort-of-works with my k7s5a motherboard.
Using the GPL driver from ite.
(copy at 
http://www.mauve.demon.co.uk/iteraid.c
)
It causes massive keyboard problems, complaining about keycode 0 being undefined.
I suspect this is due to interrupt 1 (i8042) somehow being triggered every
time that 11 (it8218) is.
About 80% of the time.
Any clues about where in general I should start looking?
