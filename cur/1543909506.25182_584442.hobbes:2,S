Right.

Yup.

There are other lock interactions that may cause problems. If we do not 
switch to the saving of irq flags then all involved spinlocks must become 
trylocks because the interrupt could have happened while the spinlock is 
held. So interrupts must be disabled on locks acquired during an 
interrupt.
