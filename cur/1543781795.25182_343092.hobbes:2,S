The nodemanager RFC I sent a month ago
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=112166723919347&w=2
amounts to half of dlm/config.c (everything under comms/ above) moved into
a separate kernel module.  That would be trivial to do, and is still an
option to bat around.
I question whether factoring such a small chunk into a separate module is
really worth it, though?  Making all of config.c (all of /config/dlm/
above) into a separate module wouldn't seem quite so strange.  It would
require just a few lines of code to turn it into a stand alone module.
