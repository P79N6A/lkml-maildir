It happens here, a bit.  My machine goes up to 60% dirty when it should be
clamping at 40%.
The variable `total_pages' in page-writeback.c (from
nr_free_pagecache_pages()) is too high.  I trace it back to here:
On node 0 totalpages: 1572864
  DMA zone: 4096 pages, LIFO batch:1
  Normal zone: 1568768 pages, LIFO batch:31
  HighMem zone: 0 pages, LIFO batch:1
This machine only has 4G of memory, so the platform code is overestimating
the number of pages by 50%.  Can you please check your dmesg, see if your
system is also getting this wrong?
