Well, if you really want to optimize (md5sum is fast, faster than a typical hd,
and much faster than gcc), check the most recent file. If its md5sum does not
match, rsync again. 
There are many ways to optimize the md5sum of the whole tree, when a previous
tree with a trusted md5sum file is available. "find -ls" can help there. But
make sure not to over-optimize, as servers with wrong md5sum files
will be DDOSed by their clients ;-)
