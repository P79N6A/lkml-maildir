The write-page method is only required to queue the data for writing to
the media.  It is not required to complete the physical IO, so the
filesystem can use any mechanism it likes to keep those pages queued for
eventual physical IO (just as 2.3 uses the buffer lists to queue that
data for eventual writeback via bdflush).

Fine.

Yes, bumping the page count is the perfect way to do this.

PageUpToDate can't be used: it is needed to flag whether the contents of
the page are valid for a read.  A written page must always be uptodate:
!uptodate implies that we have created the page but are still reading it
in from disk (or that the readin failed for some reason).

The fs should be able to manage that on its own.  If you queue all of
the pages which have been sent to the writepage() method, then you can
flush to the physical disk whenever you want.  A trivial bdflush
lookalike in the fs itself can deal with that.
You might well want a filesystem-private pointer in the page struct off
which to hook any fs-specific data (such as your dirty page linked list
pointers and the dirty flag).  You will also need a way for the VM to
exert memory pressure on those pages if it needs to reclaim memory.
These are both things which ext3 will want anyway, so we should make
sure that any infrastructure that gets put in place for this gets
reviewed by all the different fs groups first.
