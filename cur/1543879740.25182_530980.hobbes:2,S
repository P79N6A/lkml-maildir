I won't get into the middle of this just yet, not having decided which dog I 
should bet on yet.  I've been running 2.6.21-rc6 + Con's 0.40 patch for about 
24 hours, its been generally usable, but gzip still causes lots of 5 to 10+ 
second lags when its running.  I'm coming to the conclusion that gzip simply 
doesn't play well with others...  
Amazing to me, the cpu its using stays generally below 80%, and often below 
60%, even while the kmail composer has a full sentence in its buffer that it 
still hasn't shown me when I switch to the htop screen to check, and back to 
the kmail screen to see if its updated yet.  The screen switch doesn't seem 
to lag so I don't think renicing x would be helpfull.  Those are the obvious 
lags, and I'll build & reboot to the CFS patch at some point this morning 
(whats left of it that is :).  And report in due time of course
