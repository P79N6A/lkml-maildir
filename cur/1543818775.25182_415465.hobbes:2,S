Can you confirm that you read my whole message? I might be a complete 
idiot, but let me reiterate some highlights and add a few more details 
from my last mail:
If I build a 32-bit SMP OR 64-bit UP kernel, the cards will boot and 
work *every time*.
Most of the time this is a *kernel panic* in megaraid_ack_sequence, 
somewhere through megaraid_isr in megaraid_mbox.c
*Sometimes* it results in the firmware hanging like you mentioned above.
If I compile the drivers as modules instead of statically, this 
*sometimes* results in the machine booting all the way. Once the machine 
boots up, I can give it a good 'ole I/O beatdown and it does not flinch.
As in: I boot it once, it hangs. I reboot, it panics. I reboot, it 
panics. I reboot, it works. I have 16 cards in 16 systems that all 
exhibit the same behavior. Looks like an x86_64 SMP timing issue of some 
kind to me, and less of a card issue. Please correct me if I am wrong!
