Sure, no problem.  They get defined to pmd_set/pgd_set calls
anyways.  But wouldn't that miss pgd_clear() and pmd_clear()?
Someone may find it worthwhile to, on a *_clear(), to see if
a set bit can now be clear because all the neighboring entries
are empty as well.
That might have been the reason I put it there, but I may be
giving myself too much credit :-)
