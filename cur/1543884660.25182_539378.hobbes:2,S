hmmmmmm ... i see your point now -- not present in any Kconfig file
but still being selected by a defconfig file that might still be
affecting the eventual build.  that's an easy enough change to make
but, as i've mentioned before, this output could be reduced
substantially if developers stopped using CONFIG_ prefixed macro names
for their own non-Kconfig variables (*cough* MTD *cough* :-).
but, again, some of that issue might disappear if those defconfig
files were auto-regenerated on a timely basis (if that is, in fact,
how they're kept up to date).
