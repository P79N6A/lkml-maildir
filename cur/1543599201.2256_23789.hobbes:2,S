Motherboard vendors may have disabled the bus disconnection because of a
3% performance hit, to make their boards look better in benchmarks.
In that case, the system may run perfectly stable with disconnection reenabled.
I agree that these experiments should not be performed on a production
system :)

Well, I think saving ~55W is relevant, even on a desktop system. I plan
to measure how much power these hacks really save, and if it's more than
10W, I think it's worth some more work in this area.

(asus writes that one of the problems that can happen with this power
saving mode are the huge changes in power dissipation, from 60W to 5W
and back - therefore I assume the power saving mode can save up to 55W)
