Hi Thomas,
   Some differences/questions between 2.6.18-rt6 and 2.6.18-rt7:
   In 2.6.18-rt6, using make menuconfig, there were options on the
front page for HRT Support. This seems to have moved under Processor
Type with 2.6.18-rt7. Was that on purpose?
   In 2.6.18-rt6 I turned on HRT support, left 1000 nanoseconds for
the timing, but did not enable dynamic ticks since I wasn't sure it
was OK on AMD64. Should I be using DynTicks with an AMD64 single
processor? With a dual-processor?
   On 2.6.18-rt7 it seems there is no time value setting or it's been
moved somewhere I haven't found. does that 1000 nanosecond time
setting still apply?
Thanks,
Mark
