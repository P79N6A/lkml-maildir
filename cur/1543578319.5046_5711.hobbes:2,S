Hi - can someone confirm or deny that these are bugs?
I compiled pre1 for a 256Mb machine with them both "fixed", and it
worked fine.
        Based on my quick reading of this patch:
+
+empty:
+       spin_lock(&mmlist_lock);
+       return 0;
The above should actually be spin_UNlock?
Also the test for !inactive_shortage() seems to be inverted?
+               /* If refill_inactive_scan failed, try to page stuff
out.. */
+               swap_out(priority, gfp_mask);
+       } while (!inactive_shortage());
