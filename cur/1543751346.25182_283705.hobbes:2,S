I hoped that floppies will die before...  FDRAWCMD receives array
of floppy_raw_cmd structures, and to find how many of these structures
you have to peek into every of them to find whether there is next one or
not, and structures itself contain pointers to other memory...  I'll code up
something during weekend.

With per-file compat_ioctl ipx ioctls (using SIOCPRIVATE+X range) could
be made to work too, so only thing left for me is USB.
