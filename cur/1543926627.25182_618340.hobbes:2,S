Greetings,
Ive been following your discussion and documentation efforts concerning pm in the kernel. This has in the past been a gray area which was hard to find information about so kudos.
I maintain 2 handheld platforms that would benefit greatly from implementing proper pm (mainly suspend) but Im having problems bugtracking it. Currently the system tries to suspend but fails somewhere and then tries to resume (which fails). The end result however is that Im unable to see anything (bugmessages...) since the video driver gets deactivated by pm.
My question is this: Is bisecting (turning off device support in kernel until it works) the best approach when bugtracking pm suspend? Or is there any other logging system that I can use?
