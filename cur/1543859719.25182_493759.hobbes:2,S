Committed to linux1394-2.6.git.
BTW, I prepended "ieee1394:" to the titles of most of the commits to
this tree. From now on I will always do this on commits affecting
mainline's FireWire stack, and prepend "firewire:" to the titles of
commits affecting the JUJU stack. It's redundant but IMO helpful when
reading changelogs.
