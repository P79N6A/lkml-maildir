I have to wonder, just how many setuid executables do people have?
Implementing filesystem capability bits in ramfs or tmpfs might do
the job. At boot, initramfs stuff puts a few trusted executables
in /trusted and sets the capability bits. Then "mount --bind" to
put /trusted/su over an empty /bin/su file, or use symlinks.
One might as well make "nosuid" the default then, and mount the
root filesystem that way. It's not as if a system needs to have
gigabytes of setuid executables.
