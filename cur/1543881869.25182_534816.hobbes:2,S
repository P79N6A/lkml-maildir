Yes, what originated from discussions on #linuxfs is that redundancy is 
required for cnodes, in order to avoid checking the entire file system 
in search of a dangling cnode reference or for "parent" of a cnode.
If corruption, due to any reason, occurs in any other part of the file 
system, it would be localized for that chunk. Even if entire fsck is 
needed, chances of which are rare, full fsck of chunked file system is 
no worse than fsck of non-chunked file system. Passes 3, 4, and 5 of 
fsck take only 10-15% of total fsck run time and almost no-I/O Pass 6 
for chunkfs wouldn't add whole lot.
