The RC_REPLSTAT messages are occurring because the 'readdir' function
is marked as being RC_REPLSTAT in the nfsd_procedures2.
 This confuses the code in 'nfsd_cache_update', because
'nfssvc_encode_readdirres' significantly changes the length of the buffer.
My question is therefore: Why is readdir not marked as RC_NOCACHE?
Cheers,
