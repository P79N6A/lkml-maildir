I'm not sure what the problem with your setup is, but I have three
systems that start up in non-80x25 modes, and ALL of them correctly
scroll at full screen and use its full width without any problems.
For reference, my P166 boots into 80x50 mode, my 486 laptop boots into
80x60 mode and my K6-2 boots into 128x43 mode, and the kernel
correctly deals with all three of them.
The P166 and 486 have been using those screen sizes since 2.0.33 was
current. I didn't get the K6-2 until recently, but it's run with those
dimensions under RedHat's 2.2.5-15 and 2.2.5-22 kernels as well as
under raw compiled 2.2.6, 2.2.9 and 2.2.10 kernels. I would therefore
have to assume that suchlike support is not a recent invention...

As far as I can tell, it already does. In fact, the only time I've had
any problems was when I'd previously run a script that ran the command
`stty rows 25 columns 80` irrespective of what the screen dimensions
were, and I then ran `screen` - the result was, to put it politely, a
mess...
Best wishes from Riley.
