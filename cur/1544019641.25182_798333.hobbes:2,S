Hi Vivek,
I split this mail thread into three topics:
  o 2-Level IO scheduling
  o Hierarchical grouping facility for IO controller
  o Implement IO controller as a dm-driver
This mail is about 2-Level IO scheduling.

If you are satisfied with low-accuracy bandwidth control by an IO
scheduler, you don't need to use dm-ioband. If you want to use
dm-ioband with an IO scheduler, dm-ioband can work with any type of IO
scheduler, of course dm-ioband can work with your own IO scheduler
which you are developing.

I don't think so. Dm-ioband doesn't break IO scheduler's assumptions.
In CFQ's case, the priority order is not changed within a cgroup.

It's not an issue, it's a talk about how to determine a policy.
I think giving priority to cgroup policy rather than I/O scheduler
policy is more flexible.

It is possible to modify dm-ioband to cooperate with CFQ, but I'm not
sure it's really meaningful. What do you do when a task of RT class
issues a lot of I/O? Do you always give priority to the I/Os from the
task of RT class despite of the assigned bandwidth? Which one do you
give priority bandwidth or RT class?
