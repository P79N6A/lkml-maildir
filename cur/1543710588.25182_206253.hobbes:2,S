Pagetables of a kind the core understands may not be present there.
On ia32 one could in theory have a pmd_huge() check, which would in
turn not suffice for ia64 and sparc64 hugetlb. These were only examples.
Other unusual forms of mappings, e.g. VM_RESERVED and VM_IO, may also
be bad ideas to trip over by accident.

I'm not sure how that came in. The issue I had in mind was strictly
a matter of tripping over things one can't make sense of from
pagetables alone in try_to_unmap().
COW-shared anonymous pages not unmappable via anonymous COW sharing
groups arising from truncate() vs. remap_file_pages() interactions and
failures to check for nonlinearly-mapped pages in pagetable walkers are
an issue in general of course, but they just aren't this issue.
