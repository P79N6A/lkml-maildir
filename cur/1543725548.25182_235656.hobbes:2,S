So does cryptoloop use a different IV for different blocks?  The need
for the IV to be secret is different for different ciphers, but for
block ciphers the rule is that is must not repeat, and at least
according to some people must not be trivially predictable.  One way
to do that is to use a secure hash of (key,block #) as the IV.
