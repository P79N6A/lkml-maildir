My first idea was call it "display", for small/medium screens of any
kind (LCD, OLED, FED, NED... whatever). I named it "drivers/display/",
so anyone who create a driver for a display or display controller can
put it there (creating a separator for its own category at Kconfig),
as there aren't so many of them for now.
But people said "display" could be so generic and cause confusion with
usual video drivers, so I renamed it to "drivers/lcddisplay/", as it
is more expressive (however when someone will create a OLED driver
will have to create a new folder...).
I would like to put any kind of display driver there (LCD, OLED...)
not just LCDs and name it "drivers/display". I think people won't
confuse them with VESA... as there aren't drivers for "screens", just
for video cards (logically). But some people don't agree.
