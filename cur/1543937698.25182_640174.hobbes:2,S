That's not how this works (as we obviously agree).
Please consider a rewrite of your example, demonstrating the usefulness and
proper application of const pointers:
extern foo(const int *);
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
 int i;
 i = 5;
 foo(&i);
 return i;
}
Now, if the program returns anything else than 5, it means someone cast away
const, which is generally considered a bad idea in most other software
projects, for this very reason.
*That* is the purpose of const pointers.
Besides, for most debugging-enabled free() implementations, free() does indeed
touch the memory pointed to by its argument, which makes giving it a const
pointer completely bogus except for a single potential optimized special-case
where it might actually not touch the memory.
