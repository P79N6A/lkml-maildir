Subject: Serial port numbering (ttyS..) wrong for 2.5.61+

Since I tried the 2.5 kernel versions somewhere in the 2.5.6x range, I
see rather odd port naming for the extra 4 serial ports on a PCI-card.
The first two are numered as ttyS14, ttyS15 while the last two are
ttyS2 and ttyS3 !
I tried to find where these numbers are coming from but couldn't really
find an obvious place in the various drivers/char/* or drivers/serial/*
files.
Note that the ttyS14 port actually works so this seems only a bug in
the numbering.
