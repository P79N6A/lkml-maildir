Interesting. So far I have been able to help three or four people
with a similar setup, but without EZDrive.
The present theory is:
(i) AWARD BIOS 4.51PG crashes when it sees a disk larger than 32 GB.
(ii) Applying the J46 jumper is equivalent to a SETMAX command
and turns the disk into a 32 GB one. (The precise effect depends
on the model. Early models also require a utility JUMPON.EXE.)
This allows one to boot.
(iii) EZDrive/MaxBlast or Linux can issue a SETMAX command to get
full capacity again.
By separate mail I'll send you a setmax utility, so that you
can play a bit with these things.
(I cannot really release utilities like setmax before the ioctl
code in ide.c has been adapted very slightly. Will produce a patch
if I have time later this evening.)

It won't be better.

With large disks it is always good to have a recent fdisk.
(Forgot whether 2.9f is too old.) But your problem is elsewhere.

This is clear: the kernel tries to read sector 71987265, that
is 71987265*512=36857479680 bytes (37 GB) from the start, but
the disk was clipped to 32 GB, so the disk reports that it
cannot find such a sector: DriveReady SeekComplete SectorIdNotFound.
Apparently you have been able to partition the disk.
Was that under Linux?
What interests me: did you boot Linux via MaxBlast?
In that case I would have expected that MaxBlast already
had unlocked the upper part of the disk.
