This option is new and not yet available in 2.6.15, so you may have
to use your patch temporarily. If you can, set CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT = n
in Device Drivers -> Graphics support -> Console Drivers ->
Video mode selection support. However, this is automatically selected by FB, 
PCI, and X86_32, so it may not be changeable.
The "vga=" option will not be available if VIDEO_SELECT is not set.
Or just apply this changeset:

to make CONFIG_FB_FIRMWARE_EDID available.
