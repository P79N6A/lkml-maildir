Most people (including OpenSSH!) are already using /dev/urandom where
appropriate.
If you care about the difference between /dev/random and /dev/urandom,
then you ought to care about the difference _actually being there_. If
your entropy estimates are not conservative, then your system will
leak entropy faster than it takes it in and then /dev/random and
/dev/urandom will by identical _by definition_.

Why would that be sad? It's at least billions of times easier to break
a 128-bit key than to guess the internal state of /dev/urandom, even
if the system has no entropy sources.

Simple enough:
mv /dev/random /dev/super-random
ln -s /dev/urandom /dev/random
Backward compatible and everything.
