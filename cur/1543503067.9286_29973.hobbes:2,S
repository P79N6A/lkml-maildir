I agree. In terms of features V2 seems complete anyway. I'm using
2.2.11pre with the patches from knfsd 1.4.4, with lockd and statd
running on 3 machines, and all the problems i used to have with older
linux kernels are gone. Eg pine not recognizing which folders had new
messages, windowmaker not recognizing config files had changed, etc.
Havn't had any stability problems either. (touch wood).
It all works beautifully now. (and i don't have to use noac!)
thanks,
