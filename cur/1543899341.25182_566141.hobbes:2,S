Ah sorry to misinterpret the content:), its a quiet new piece of hardware (at 
most ~1.5 month old) and  "Reallocated_Event_Count" constantly increases 
(currently its increased to 313) and although i'm not 100 percent sure these 
errors only occured with kernels > 2.6.18 (or 2.6.18 didn't report these 
cause according to kern.log these only visible with 2.6.22+) 
We bought 3 HP Pavillon dv2385ea and one of them only runs with 2.6.18 and its 
smartctl output follows as a reference;

What is your suggestion in that case will i try to change the hardware 
assuming its harware's fault or that may be regression introduced by kernels 
newer than 2.6.18?
