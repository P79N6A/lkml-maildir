That is true. All was done under the 16-bit assumption
My hunch is that the current algorithm might actually work quite well
for a sparsely populated pid-space (32-bits).
A bitmap-ed based solution is not possible at that point due to space
requirements.
Should be easy to figure out.

That assumption is pretty central to the debate.
I don't see the standard get_pid nor the bitmap based
get_pid scale to something larger than a 16-bit pid_t.
If we're not sure yet whether we want to keep pid_t 16
bits it might be worth putting in an algorithm that does
scale to larger numbers, if only so the switch to a larger
pid_t will be more straightforward.
kind regards,
Rik
