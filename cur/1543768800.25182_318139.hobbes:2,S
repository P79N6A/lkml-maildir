The SCTP RFC3309 says that SCTP uses a tranport-level CRC where the bit
ordering is mirrored and different from link-level CRC.
The CRC is computed using a procedure similar to ETHERNET CRC [ITU32],
modified to reflect transport level usage.
So I am not sure if we can use the libcrc32c routines for calculating SCTP
crc32 checksum. But if it is possible, we should definitely use the crc32
library.
Thanks
