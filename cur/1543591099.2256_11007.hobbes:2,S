I think using pointers to inode structures as inode numbers might be
an optimal solution. Since inode structure is long, it can even be
shifted few bits left if some special numbers are needed. Uniqueness
check should be added for 64-bit platforms, but it should work without
(kernel memory is not large enough for the nuber to wrap).
