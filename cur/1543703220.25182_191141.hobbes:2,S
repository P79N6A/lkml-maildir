Or lilo. Abit BIOS, Adaptec SCSI BIOS, Highpoint HPT370 BIOS and lilo are
the only pieces of code that get executed between power on and the kernel.
Unfortunately, I was unable to rule that (unlikely) alternative out just
yet, because I found out that the box doesn't have a working floppy either
(cdrom is not plugged because of lack of cables - I guess I miswired the
floppy drive too when I last messed with the power cables.) This is also why
I didn't try your DOS disk on the box. It seems its diskedit can recognize
at least scsi disks, so it could well handle the disk on Highpoint
controller, too. Anyway, thanks for that (and reminding me how rusty my
French is - and has always been :). I plan to try booting from floppy
without lilo and the dos editor, when I next open the box and can fix the
floppy wiring. It's a server so I don't take it down all the time...

Something like that crossed my mind initially, but waiting >10min between
the write and boot didn't help, nor did "hdparm -W 0"...

gives some details. Basicly it's a Abit ST6R mobo (i815 and HPT370 IDEs),
and three Maxtor 250GB disk (root and first data fs), 3 Samsung 80GB's
(second data fs). One of the Samsungs on the HPT370 is the one that exhibits
the corruption.

No. I could try that.

Ok, if only I can manage to find such options from the BIOS.

No wonder. So far you have been most helpful - bug thanks for that.
PS: Again, the next round of results will only be in after some time - as I
said, I'll need to wait for a suitable reboot time for the box... Sorry for
the trickle.
