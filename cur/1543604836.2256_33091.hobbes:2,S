99% of the time, (32-bit) linux applications will compile and run fine on my
alpha.  There are 3 potential problems though:
    1) sizeof(long) != sizeof(int)
    2) any assembly language in the source.
    3) sizeof(void*) != sizeof(int)
The first two can be readily identified by grepping for "long", "asm" and
looking for .s files.  The last one causes compiler warnings, but does not
usually cause the application to fail to compile or run.
