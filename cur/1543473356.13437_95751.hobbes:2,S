Well.. i dont plan on going to 2.2.0 until it's as stable
as, or stabler than the 2.0.xx series. Anything that's broke in 2.2.0pre
right now that wasn't broke in 2.0.xx needs to be fixed before 2.2.0 rolls
out.
maybe that's a really bold statement, and maybe i'm just out of the kernel
loop still, but maybe you need that kind of perspective from the outside.
