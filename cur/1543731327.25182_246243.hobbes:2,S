You're completely missing the point. I never said that the pwcx driver 
copies code from the kernel, and in doing so infringes copyright law.
What I'm saying is that the kernel is distributed with a license that 
allows you certain rights, and that extending the kernel functionality 
through closed source drivers is not one of those rights.

You're being silly, I've never said anything about header files, nor 
copied lines of code.

It is a derived work, not a "copied" work. The point is:

In the case of a nvidia driver (for instance) one can argue that the 
driver was written for another well known closed source operating 
system, and was latter ported to Linux, so that we can not honestly say 
that it is a derived work.
Anyway, this is all a big gray area, with darker and lighter tones of 
gray. So you only get a definite answer in front of a judge.
This whole discussion has been beaten to death in the past. I really 
don't want to go through that again. Although I have not been directly 
involved in the past discussion, the traffic in LKML is high enough that 
it doesn't need another one of those threads...
