Subject: [PATCH] Remove MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT from i2o_block.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/2/21/15

Please go easy on me if this patch is stupid, because it's not really
my patch. Someone told me these were removable alltogether since they
are deprecated, so I found one of them in John Cherry's compile stats
and simply removed it. Please apply in case it's not idiotic. Thanks.
Applies against Linux 2.6.3.
