We need this for
1. keeping page's owner to uncharge to IT when page
   goes away. Or do you propose to uncharge it to
   current (i.e. ANY) container like you do all across
   Vserver accounting which screws up accounting with
   pages sharing?
2. managing LRU lists for good reclamation. See Balbir's
   patches for details.
3. possible future uses - correct sharing accounting,
   dirty pages accounting, etc

lkml.org archives and google will help you :)
