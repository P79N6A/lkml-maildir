Hi Lee,
Unfortunately, the driver needs to populate several coefficient tables 
for the hardware to perform silence suppression and other advance 
features. The values for these tables are calculated using log10 
operations. I don't  see a clean way to push these operations to user 
space without the need for custom applications that build the tables and 
pass them to the driver.
Thanks,
Carlos Munoz
