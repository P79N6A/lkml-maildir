Thanks for the input. As far as I can tell I do have ACPI enabled, and
sky2 still fails on 2.6.15, 2.6.16-rc3 or -rc4. See my attached dmesg
output and config.
Also, if you get the latest driver from Marvel it does apply to more
recent kernels (install-8_30.tar.bz2), 2.6.15 for sure.
I have the Marvell script generated patches for 2.6.15 and 
2.6.16-rc3 available, but they are 350K each compressed which seems
a bit large to email.
I made them available from my website if you are interested:
