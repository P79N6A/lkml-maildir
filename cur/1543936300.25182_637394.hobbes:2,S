+Description:
+		This attribute is for use for system-diagnostic software
+		only.
+
+		The kernel may decide to restrict PCI configuration space
+		access for userspace to the first 64 or 256 bytes by
+		default, for stability reasons. This attribute, when
+		present, can be used to request access to the full
+		4Kb from the kernel.
+
+		Request to get access to the full 4Kb can be done by
+		writing a '1' into this attribute file. All other values
+		are reserved for future use and should not be used by
+		software at this point.
+
+		The kernel may log the request to the various kernel
+		logging services. The kernel may decide to ignore the
+		request if the kernel deems extended configuration space
+		access not reliable enough for the system or the device.
+		The kernel may decide to not present this attribute
+		if the kernel decides extended config space is reliable
+		and made available by default, or if the kernel decides
+		that extended configuration space will never be
+		accessible.
+
+		Software needs to gracefully deal with getting the
+		access not granted. Software also needs to gracefully deal
+		with this attribute not being present.
+
+		Due to the fragility of extended configuratio space,
+		system diagnostic software should only set this attribute
+		on explicit user request, or in the case of GUI like tools,
+		at least with explicit user permission.
