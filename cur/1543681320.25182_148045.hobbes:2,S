Ah really? I though that his changes were not merged in your 0.1.8 patch.
So can I just revert his patch and accept your instead that all of his
stuff is in ? Whoaa, great.

Ani, I received complains that you were not accepting patches from Ben. He
needs that code in.

I prefer playing no silly games in the 2.4 stable series, as I've been
trying to do so far. If you had accepted Ben's changes in the first place
I wouldnt need to apply his patch.
Ben is very interested in maintaining the driver, AFAIK. Is that
correct, Ben?
Are you interested in giving up maintenance?
For me it doenst matter who maintains the driver, as long as it is well
maintained.
