In fact I remember having seen something like 10-20% throughput increase 
for the same drive used in UDMA mode 4 (66MB/s) on an HPT366 and UDMA 
mode 5 (100MB/s) on a SiS735 for a drive which maxed out at around 
30/35MB/s.
This could be either caused by IDE controller/PCI interface 
(mis)behaviour, drive firmware tuned for ATA100 instead of ATA66, IDE 
bus overheads. I don't know for sure, but apparently switching from 
ATA66 to ATA100 can bring some juice in some cases where the max platter 
throughput is not even near max advertised IDE bandwidth.
Anyway, to answer to the original post, 38.1 MB/s is quite good.
