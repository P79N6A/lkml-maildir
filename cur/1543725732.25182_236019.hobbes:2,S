Ermm..need sleep. What I meant is that D-BUS (kdbusd really) should
take care of generating the object name expected by D-BUS clients
from the kernel object name.  Looking at the kbdusd source, it expects
the kernel to provide a D-BUS object name it can stuff directly into
the dbus_message_new_signal() call.  This means forcing a specific 
kevent-handling mechanism's implementation on the kernel.  I don't think 
that's what we want to do as the sending of events and how those events 
happen to be parsed and handled in userspace should be kept separate.
