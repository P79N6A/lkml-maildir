Which ones? Are you talking about the mmap() problem that he reported?
We're still looking for a solution to that. I'm not convinced that his
fix is appropriate as it appears to me just to be playing with the
timing of the symptoms.
Unless he's hoarding something, then most of the other 2.4 fixes
should be stuff he got off Chuck and me, so those are already in...
Cheers,
