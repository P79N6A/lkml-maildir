To clarify this one a bit:                                            
shrink_cache is thought to do what it says, it is given a number of   
pages it should somehow manage to free by shrinking the cache. What my
patch does is go after the _whole_ list to fulfill that. One cannot   
really say that this is the wrong thing to do, I guess. If it takes   
time to _find_ free pages with shrink_cache, then probably the idea to
use it was wrong in the first place (which is not the fault of the    
function itself). Or the number of free-pages to find is to high, or  
(as a last but guess unrealistic approach) the swap_out eats the time 
and shouldn't be called when nr_pages (return value) is equal to zero.
This last one could be checked (hint hint Lorenzo ;-) by simply       
modifiying                                                            
if (max_swapped==0)                                                   
                                                                      
to                                                                    
                                                                      
if (max_swapped==0 && nr_pages>0)                                     
                                                                      
at the end of shrink_cache.                                           
Thinking again about this it really sounds like the right choice,     
because there is no need to swap when we fulfilled the requested      
number of free-pages.                                                 
                                                                      
You should try.                                                       
                                                                      
Thank you for your patience Lorenzo                                   
                                                                      
Regards,
