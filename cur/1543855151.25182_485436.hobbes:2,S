Ok, the following patch restores the CONFIG_FS_CAPS=n signaling
behavior, but I'm having a config problem.  When
CONFIG_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES=n, and I toggle
CONFIG_SECURITY_FS_CAPABILITIES between y and n, security/commoncap.o
does not recompile.  However since capabilities are now the default
security module, commoncap.o is in fact included in the kernel build,
and therefore should be recompiled.
Looking into why, but maybe someone knows offhand what would be going
wrong?
thanks,

Subject: [PATCH 1/1] file caps: permit unsafe signaling when CONFIG_FS_CAPS=n
In legacy behavior, when a user starts a setuid program, that user
can send signals to the running program.  The file capabilities
patch prevents that not only when file capabilities are enabled,
but in all cases where capabilities are used.
For instance, when starting the X server, which is setuid root, it
is expected that the user who started it be able to kill it.
Existing behavior should not be changed.  This patch should reenable
signaling setuid processes started by the signaling user.
