It wouldn't hurt, but even if we get -mkernel support in gcc, that doesn't 
mean that the stack frame size has to change: You can easily have %r15
point to 160 bytes above the register save area without actually using all 
that space for saving registers. The only thing that would need to change is 
the location of the backchain pointer.

That actually was what Martin tried in his first implementation (well, the 
last one before the one he submitted). It didn't work out because some code 
relied on the stack starting right after pt_regs. Martin can probably clarify 
that on Friday.
