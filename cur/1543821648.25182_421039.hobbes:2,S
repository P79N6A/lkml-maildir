Soo Keong or Steve, can you answer this one?

I don't think NMI's are so much the problem as those blasted SMI's.  And
SMI's are not for sharing :(
These problems are BIOS specific, Your Mileage Will Vary from one bios
to the next.

It's not the SMI from ECC events that are the problem.  It's the BIOS
assuming no one else would want to use those registers on Dev0:Fun1, and
the fact that you still end up with a race between the OS and the BIOS
SMI to handle the events.
