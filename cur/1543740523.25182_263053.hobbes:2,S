It's easy to have >>1000 context switches per second on a server.  Consider a 
web server that receives a network packet, issues a request to a database, hands 
some work off to a thread so the main app doesn't block, then sends a response. 
  That could be a half dozen context switches per packet.  If you have 20000 
packets/sec coming in....
