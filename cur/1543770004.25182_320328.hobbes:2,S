just to make sure, by "much more complicated" are you referring to the 
PREEMPT_RT feature? Right now PREEMPT_RT consists of 8000 new lines of 
code (of which 2000 is debugging code) and 2000 lines of modified kernel 
code. One of the primary goals i had was to keep it simple and robust.
That's more than 3 times smaller than UML and it's almost an order of
magnitude smaller than a nanokernel codebase i just checked, and it
boots/works on just about everything where the stock Linux kernel boots.
I challenge you to write a nanokernel/hypervisor with a comparable
feature-set in that many lines of code.
anyway, as always, the devil is in the details. I certainly dont suggest 
that nanokernels/hypervisors are not nice (to the contrary!), or that 
all component technologies of the -RT patchset will be accepted into 
Linux. PREEMPT_RT started out as an experiment to reduce scheduling 
latencies within the constraints of the Linux kernel. It is not an 
all-or-nothing feature, it's more of a collection of incremental 
patches. It is one, nonexclusive way of doing things.
