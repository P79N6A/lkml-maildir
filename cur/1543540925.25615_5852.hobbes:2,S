Incredible number.
This limit comes from link count of ext2fs's.
You can change the definition of EXT2_LINK_MAX in
include/linux/ext2fs.h upto 32765 since struct inode.i_nlink is
unsigned short, and recompile your kernel.
But another normal kernel will not operate such too many linked files
and directories.
