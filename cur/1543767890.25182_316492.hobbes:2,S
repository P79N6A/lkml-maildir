ok, now after collecting the data after a lot of "sysrq-p" after a lot 
times running into the same 100% of kswapd0, i am sure: it's always the 
same trouble.
it's also reproducable with rc3-mm3
> Does disabling cachefs in kerel config fix it?
it seems so, yes. now i'm running rc3-mm3 with disabled cachefs (config 
can be found at [1]) for more than 6 hours (also under heavy I/O on 
harddrives) and it is still behaving normal - no running kswapd0 any more 
(kswapd0 finally managed to find some sleep ;-) )
greetings,
Damir
