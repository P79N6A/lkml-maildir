There isn't anything in setup.S that would run differently on a
'386 to a '686. The CPU-dependent stuff runs after everything is
uncompressed. That said, there is a loop in setup.S that I don't
like. At line 690, the label, a20_wait, 4 lines later a `je a20_wait`.
Comment that out with a '#' and see if it boots. This alias may remain
in the cache forever so it's not a good way to see if a20 is enabled.
Let me know if it 'fixes' the problem. If so, the person who rewrote
setup.S should find another way to check on a20.
Cheers,
