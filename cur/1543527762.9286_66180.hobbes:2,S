One *small* reason is that you will get "variable may be used uninitialized"
warnings from the compiler if the variable is always set inside conditionals
and it can't be proved that every path hits an assignment.  So if
compiling without warnings is important to you, you have to either initialize
the variable or suppress the warnings.
