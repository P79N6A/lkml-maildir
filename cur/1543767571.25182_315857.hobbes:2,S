I don't understand why this is so.
Certainly, the exclusive cpusets do not form a disjoint cover.  Not
disjoint, because the top cpuset is exclusive, and overlaps with all
other cpusets.  Nor do the other exclusive cpusets, excluding the top,
necessarily form a cover - there might not even be any other such
cpusets.
