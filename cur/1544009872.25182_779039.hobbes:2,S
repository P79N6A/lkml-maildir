I think these are probably due to akpm's patches yesterday.  I think 
they've already been dropped.  The original issue still exists however, as 
reported by Arjan (kerneloops) and others.
We have Dave Graham here working on this, he is not done yet but he is 
making progress.  We hope to have something to post soon.
