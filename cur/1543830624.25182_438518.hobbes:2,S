I was asking the question because in some case, we want a lightweight 
container for running applications (aka application container) who need 
to share the filesystem and it will be too bad to have a network 
namespace which brings isolation and prevents to implement application 
containers. By the way, I agree from a point of view of a system 
container, a complete network isolation is perfect.
