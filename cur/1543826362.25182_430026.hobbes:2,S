to have lock validation you should have these options enabled:
 CONFIG_PROVE_SPIN_LOCKING=y
 CONFIG_PROVE_RW_LOCKING=y
 CONFIG_PROVE_MUTEX_LOCKING=y
 CONFIG_PROVE_RWSEM_LOCKING=y
otherwise the tests are still run, but the deadlocks are not detected. 
That's why those 141 testcases are 'expected' failures.
and definitely try -mm3 plus the current combo patch:
