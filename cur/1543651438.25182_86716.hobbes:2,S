What you describe is certainly Linus' general philosophy.
But he also said that the feature was in "vendor push" mode, which
means if enough vendors adopt the feature he would consider. Why do
you think reisferfs got into the mainline - certainly not because he
uses it personally.
He also said he has seen no evidence of its usefulness... not one
report on L-K of kernel problems resolved.
Seems pretty clear to me...
