In keeping with the spirit of adding new useful features when they help 
solve real world problems, I've added this ability to collectl as a 
direct result of a problem we were recently having when doing some 
network performance testing.  It turned out all the interrupts were 
being processed by cpu0 (this was on an 8-core system) but all collectl 
told us was the aggregate number!  Once we moved to a NIC/driver that 
supported multiple queues that could distribute interrupts to multiple 
CPUs it only made sense to enhance collectl to let us verify that this 
was indeed happening - I personally find examining /proc/interrupts for 
changes more trouble than it's worth.
In any event, the following is an example of how collectl can present 
this data, first summarized by CPU:
#Time     Cpu0 Cpu1 Cpu2 Cpu3 Cpu4 Cpu5 Cpu6 Cpu7
12:49:55  4828  16K 1000  16K   18  16K  16K    0
12:49:56  4804  16K 1000  16K    0  16K  16K    0
12:49:57  4811  16K 1000  16K   18  16K  16K    0
12:49:58  4789  16K 1000  16K    0  17K  16K   44
and here by the type of the interrupt itself:
# INTERRUPT DETAILS
#          Int    Cpu0   Cpu1   Cpu2   Cpu3   Cpu4   Cpu5   Cpu6   Cpu7 
  Type            Device(s)

12:48:50   122       0      0   2240      0      0      0      0

6417   PCI-MSI-X       eth3 (queue 7)
12:48:50   218       1      0      0      0      0      0      0      
0   PCI-MSI         eth0
You can also look at all CPU loads and interrupts together like this:
# SINGLE CPU STATISTICS
#            CPU  USER NICE  SYS WAIT IRQ  SOFT STEAL IDLE INTRPT
07:09:28       0     0    0    0    0    0    0     0  100     16
07:09:28       1     0    0    0    0    0    0     0  100      0
07:09:28       2     0    0    0    0    0    0     0  100    999
07:09:28       3     0    0    0    0    0    0     0  100     16
For those not familiar with collectl, you can collect virtually 
everything all the existing linux 'stat' utilitie provide plus a lot 
more such as processes (including I/O stats), Infininband, Quadrics, 
Slab, Lustre and more.  Plus a lot more feature too numerous to list but 
there's a pretty good summary here - 
http://collectl.sourceforge.net/Features.html
But don't take my word for it, check out the website at 
http://collectl.sourceforge.net/
 where you can see a pretty good set of 
examples in the documentation and even follow the tutorial.
