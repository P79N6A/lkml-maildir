Subject: NFS locking does not call the filesystem lock operation

NFS locking routines (nlmsvc_lock and others in svclock.c) go directly to
the
default kernel operations (eg., posix_lock_file) and do not invoke any
filesystem
lock operation that may have been provided.  Why don't they execute the
lock
file_operation (if one exists for the filesystem) similarly to the non-NFS
fcntl_setlk which does the following:
   if (filp->f_op->lock != NULL) {
      error = filp->f_op->lock(filp, cmd, &file_lock);
Without this, a filesystem that needs to provide the lock operation has no
way to achieve proper locking via nfs clients.
