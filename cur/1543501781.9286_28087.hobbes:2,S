	sorry to repeat the message, just want to ask to
	cc me replies as my troublesome list exploder is
	having some trouble.
	i remember sct said that to have metadata immediately
	written one should "chattr +S" to directory
	the weird behaviour is (is it?) in ext2 is in ext2_new_inode()
	inode->u.ext2_i.i_flags = dir->u.ext2_i.i_flags
	so every new file has 'S' bit set, which is not what i
	want. i think i understand why the behaviour is but it's
	not right from "want to have metadata straight" pov.
	how about changing
	if (inode->u.ext2_i.i_flags & EXT2_SYNC_FL)
		inode->i_flags |= MS_SYNCHRONOUS;
	to just
	inode->u.ext_i.i_flags & ~EXT2_SYNC_FL;
	another thing is that no need to
	inode->i_flags = 0;
	in ext2/ialloc.c cause get_empty_inode() already done it
	for us. comment?
	imel
