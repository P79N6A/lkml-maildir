I was testing the new fuse shared writable mmap support, and finding
that bash-shared-mapping deadlocks (which isn't so strange ;).  What
is more strange is that this is not an OOM situation at all, with
plenty of free and cached pages.
A little more investigation shows that a similar deadlock happens
reliably with bash-shared-mapping on a loopback mount, even if only
half the total memory is used.
The cause is slightly different in the two cases:
  - loopback mount: allocation by the underlying filesystem is stalled
    on throttle_vm_writeout()
  - fuse-loop: page dirtying on the underlying filesystem is stalled on
    balance_dirty_pages()
In both cases the underlying fs is totally innocent, with no
dirty/writback pages, yet it's waiting for the global dirty+writeback
to go below the threshold, which obviously won't, until the
allocation/dirtying succeeds.
I'm not quite sure what the solution is, and asking for thoughts.
Ideas:
  - per filesystem dirty counters.  If filesystem is clean (or dirty
    is below some minimum), then balance_dirty_pages() should no wait
    any more
  - throttle_vm_writeout() was meant to throttle swapping, no?  So in
    that case there should be a separate swap-writback counter
Thanks,
Miklos
