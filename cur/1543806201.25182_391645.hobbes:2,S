So looking at kref and looking at my code I have a small amount of feedback.
It looks like using kref would increase the size of my code as I would
have to add an additional function.  Further I don't see that it would
simplify anything in my code. 
The extra debugging checks in krefs are nice, but not something I
am lusting over.
As for code recognition I don't see how recognizing the atomic_t idiom
versus the kref idiom is much different.  But I haven't had this issue
come up in a code review so I have no practical experience there.
The biggest issue I can find with kref is the name.  kref is not a
reference it is a count.  A reference count if you want to be long
about it. Just skimming code using it looks like kref is a pointer to
a generic object that you are getting and putting. 
It also doesn't help that current krefs are used in little enough code
that I still find it jarring to see one.  One more abstraction to
read.  Whereas atomic_t are everywhere, so I am familiar with them.
So those are all of the nits I can pick. :)  I don't kref seems to be
a perfectly usable piece of code but not one that seems to help my
code.  Unless it becomes a mandate from the code correctness police.
