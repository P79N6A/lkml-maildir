Subject: [PATCH] allocation looping + kswapd CPU cycles
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

  In 2.4.3pre6, code in page_alloc.c:__alloc_pages(), changed from;
	try_to_free_pages(gfp_mask);
	wakeup_bdflush();
	if (!order)
		goto try_again;
to
	try_to_free_pages(gfp_mask);
	wakeup_bdflush();
	goto try_again;
  This introduced the effect of a non-zero order, __GFP_WAIT allocation
(without PF_MEMALLOC set), never returning failure.  The allocation keeps
looping in __alloc_pages(), kicking kswapd, until the allocation succeeds.
  If there is plenty of memory in the free-pools and inactive-lists
free_shortage() will return false, causing the state of these
free-pools/inactive-lists not to be 'improved' by kswapd.
  If there is nothing else changing/improving the free-pools or
inactive-lists, the allocation loops forever (kicking kswapd).
  Does anyone know why the 2.4.3pre6 change was made?
  The attached patch (against 2.4.5-pre1) fixes the looping symptom, by
adding a counter and looping only twice for non-zero order allocations.
  The real fix is to measure fragmentation and the progress of kswapd, but
that is too drastic for 2.4.x.
