I know.  But if you look at the source, the generic stuff is
directly including asm-ia64/efi.h, so this makes it compile.  I
agree having the generic stuff include asm-ia64 code is really
stupid, but changing that seemed far more invasive and frankly, I
don't even know what an "EFI" is, so I didn't want to mess with
it beyond making it compile per how it is currently doing things,
