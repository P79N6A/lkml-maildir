This is something that I have been asked to look at, here.  Jeff, how 
(or is?) any of the netlink info pushed up to userspace?  The idea that 
someone came to me with was to have something in (driverfs? netdevfs?) 
that was poll()able and read()able.  read() giving current state, and 
poll() waking on changes.  Or maybe two different files, but something. 
  Of course it'd be greate to be generic.  I just assumed it would come 
from netif_* for netdevices.
Is this something planned?  wanted?  something I should bang out into 
2.5.x before end of next month?
We could have a generic device-events file (akin to acpi events) that a 
daemon dispatches events into user-land, or we could have a kernel->user 
callback a la /sbin/hotplug, or we could have many device/subsys 
specific files.
Anyone have a preference?
Tim
