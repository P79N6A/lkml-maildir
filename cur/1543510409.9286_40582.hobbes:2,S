[about Mandatory Access Control]

No, protection from self would be mandatory _default_ controls.
This is rather nice I think, with auditing for overrides...
Mandatory Access Control is intended to hinder spies. If a competitor
wants all your sales contacts, they could use a spy. This spy could
try to email your database out or put it on a Zip disk. Mandatory
access control makes this task very difficult and slow, even if the
spy is allowed to keep a private copy of the database in their home
directory and is allowed to transfer huge files to anywhere desired.
Don't bother with the printer either -- all sheets get marked in huge
letters at top and bottom.

This is already defined by standards and convention.
The standard: add one extra character after the mode
Convention: add a '+' to indicate an ACL
