I don't know why tpm_tis_init() is messing around trying different
IRQs between 3 and 16.  That looks suspiciously x86-dependent.
Maybe if you don't have PNP (though I doubt TPMs exist on any
pre-PNPBIOS machines) the "check-IRQ" loop would be necessary.
But you're using the PNP probe, and PNP should just tell you what
IRQ the device is configured for (and whether the IRQ can be
shared -- see 8250_pnp.c for an example).
The BIOS should have configured the TPM IRQ, and if we go and
mess with that IRQ setting without going through the PNP interface,
e.g., the ACPI _SRS method, we're liable to mess something up.  The
TPM is often behind a few bridges, and if the bridge has any IRQ
routing configuration, only the BIOS knows how to keep that in
sync with the TPM IRQ configuration.

What's in /sys/bus/pnp/devices/00:0e/resources?
