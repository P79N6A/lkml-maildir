Mabe it's a sign of advancing years, but I still think that 4k is worth
saving ;)  I ended up with the below.
You say that pmdisk needs this.  I assume that means that we should also
replace swapper_pg_dir with swsusp_pg_dir in pmdisk.S?

swsusp contained rather nasty bug where it killed machine when intel-agp or
anything else split kernel 4MB mapping.  Herbert Xu diagnosed this.  Fixed by
switching to "known good" mapping for during suspend/resume.
