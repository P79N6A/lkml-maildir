floppy_init() requests IRQ6, but then frees it before returning.  It
looks like the driver only holds onto it while the device is actually
open, which explains why it doesn't usually show up in /proc/interrupts.

Adrian has the floppies disabled in the BIOS, so maybe it's
legit to use IRQ6 for the NIC PCI interrupt.  But floppy.c
doesn't check for anything like that as far as I can see.
The fact that floppy.c seems to be able to poke the controller
and get an interrupt back (with "pci=routeirq") suggests to me
that the floppy controller responds even when disabled in the
BIOS, and that it actually expects IRQ6 to be level-triggered,
but the BIOS is leaving it configured as edge-triggered.
I suspect that the patch below will "fix" it.  I suppose we could
use a DMI-based quirk to poke this.  But it still feels like a
better solution would be to change floppy.c to:
	if (ACPI && (no floppy in ACPI namespace))
		return -ENODEV
