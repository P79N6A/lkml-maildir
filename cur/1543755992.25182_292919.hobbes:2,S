I suspect the problem in that case is a compressed VBIOS. Some laptops
compress the VBIOS and the system BIOS into a single ROM and then
expand them at power on. Sounds like this is not happening on resume.
To get around the problem copy the image from C000:0 before suspend to
a place in preserved RAM where wakeup.S can find it and then copy it
back to C000:0 on resume. To test for this checksum C000:0 before
suspend and after and see if it has changed.
You can always do a simple test. If a program like vbios.vm86 or
vbetool can reset the card, then there is no reason wakeup.S shouldn't
be able to do it too if the environment is set up correctly.
