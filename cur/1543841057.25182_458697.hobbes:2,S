You are right that there is no comment (or better yet, kerneldoc
comment) about what happens if an instance of work_struct is enqueued
twice. However, /a/ there is the source and /b/ Corbet, Rubini,
Kroah-Hartman: LDD3 describes in detail in an easily understood section
how workqueues are to be used. (Workqueues in Linux 2.6.10, that is.)

Acceptable on second thought, particularly in light of your new
replacement functions with improved semantics of their return value.
Although there are cases where the WARN_ON might not go off during a
long time, or where an update won't happen in many months despite
hundreds of reports at dozens of mailing lists and bugzillas.
