Of course :)
Don't get me wrong - the patch is a MAJOR improvement. Splatting
suspicious looking processes in self-defence is vastly preferable to
sitting back and watching a malicious or simply misguided resource hog
blow the whole server away!
(One possibility we haven't mentioned so far is bringing more swapspace on
line as an "emergency" measure. Many servers will have a chunk of free
space somewhere; if we could bring this online as swap space, this could
avert some problems temporarily. Windows Not Tested has a similar
facility, to expand swapspace as needed within predefined limits. I might
look into this further...)
James.
