I think you might have confused Andrew a bit more ;)
To start with, you are talking about IO schedulers, while the thread
is about CPU interactivity.
The problem here looks like something that is caused by something in mm3,
not in mm2, not linus.patch, and not context-switch-accounting-fix.patch.
Off topic: it would be good if you could try the as disk scheduler in mm3.
I recall you had some problems with it earlier, but they should be fixed in
mm3. Thanks.

Subjective reports from our base of beta testers has proven to be the
best thing.
