I am not sure drivers/mxc is the best place for it, but I am against both 
arch/arm (well, mildly, it is now preferred to put arch-specific drivers 
under drivers/) and drivers/video - I'm going to submit a camera driver 
shortly, which goes under drivers/media/video and will use the ipu driver, 
and should not depend on drivers/video. I was thinking about 
drivers/media/ipu... But eventually decided for mfd as it is 
multifunctional (no, it is not separate, is this a requirement?) - it is 
currently providing an IRQ and a DMA driver. But I don't use the mfd API 
atm. If we decide to keep it there, I can add it, if necessary / if it 
provides any advantages for this case.
In general, I am open to ideas in this respect.
Thanks
Guennadi
