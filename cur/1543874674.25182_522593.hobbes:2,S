The module load would fail.

I want to say that when dealing with cpu stuff aligning to a cache
line makes sense as it prevents multiple variables from sharing
the same cache line.  However we rarely access per cpu variables from
other cpus (the point) so the extra alignment doesn't seem to have
a justification in this context.
Although I'm not quite certain what this will do to the per cpu
memory allocator...

Look at how we define PERCPU_MODULE_RESERVE and PERCPU_ENOUGH_ROOM.

After increasing NR_IRQS on x86_64 to (NR_CPUS*32) the per cpu irq
stats got much bigger especially as NR_CPUS went up.  The only
reasonable way I could see to fix this at the time was to just make
PER_CPU_ENOUGH_ROOM do the right thing and change size dynamically
with the size of the per cpu section.  I added PERCPU_MODULE_RESERVE
to allocate the amount that we did not have compile information on.
8K was roughly what we had left over for modules before I made the
change so I just preserved that.
We do have to be careful though as some architectures have fixed sized
areas they are putting the per cpu stats into.

Well that is earlier than trap_init so it shouldn't be a problem...
