Erm... I'm not sure that it's going to be a win - could you describe a
scenario where we would write enough to make the copying sufficiently long
_and_ would hit the need to wait on read request at the last block? IOW,
what situation did you catch when testing old code? It _did_ wait on the
first read request before copying anything, so if there was a difference
it either came from waiting on the last one or from something completely
different.

Huh? generic_file_read() unlocks the page before calling actor() (and
causing the page-in). What's the problem with it?
