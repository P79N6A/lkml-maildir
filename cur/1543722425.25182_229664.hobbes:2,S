I vaguely recall someone recently talking about eliminating preempt by 
improving low-latency.  See, if everything were ideal, we wouldn't need 
preempt, because all drivers would yield the CPU at appropriate times. 
Supposedly, preempt introduces some undesirable overhead.
Perhaps we could turn preempt into some kind of watch-dog.  If a kernel 
thread doesn't behave, it gets killed.  :)
