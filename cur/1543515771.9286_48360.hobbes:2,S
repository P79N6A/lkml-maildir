I think that is only a problem with that specific VIA chipset.
I have sucessfully run UDMA the one DVD drive I have that
supports UDMA. Works like a charm. And fast too :)

Of the four ATAPI drives I have in my machine right now, three
will do DMA and the last does UDMA. I have seen ATAPI drives
report DMA capabilities and then fail miserably anyway.
Especially the earlier+cheaper models reported DMA, but
didn't work at all. Blaim the hardware.
