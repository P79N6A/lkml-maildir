Hi All,
I've researched this question and haven't been able to find a suitable
answer.  The answer may be "it's painless as-is, just go for it".  It
might also be "give up now while you still have your pants".
I'd like to use the software watchdog timer, softdog.c, on the Sparc
architecture, using kernel 2.2.17.  I used this to build the module:
cd /usr/src/linux-2.2.17/drivers/char
gcc -c -DMODVERSIONS -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
softdog.c
The module builds fine with some warnings.  After copying it over to
/lib/modules/2.2.17/misc/softdog.o and running depmod -a, I get
modprobe: ELF file not for this architecture
I haven't tried modprobe'ing the module yet, the above message frightens
me.
Is this driver safe for the sparc architecture?  If not, what would it
take?  Or did I screw up somwehere along the way?
Please CC: me as I am not on the list.
Thanks in advance,
Josh Wyatt
