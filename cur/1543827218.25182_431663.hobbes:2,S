> This leads me to the question, if there are any plans to include the dma_mmap_coherent() function (for powerpc/ppc and/or any other platform) in one of the next kernel versions and if an adapation of the ALSA drivers is planned. Or is there a simple way (hack) to fix this problem?
You are welcome to do a patch implementing this :)
Ben.
