"Ignoring"?  Hardly.  I even listed a few of them above.
But in practice, HDIO_DRIVE_CMD only requires support for a very
limited set of commands.  It was never intended for arbitrary
command acceptance.  And it's not like Joe User can abuse it,
since it requires SYSADMIN and RAWIO capabilities to execute.
The command subset that accounts for just about all uses of it today is:
SET_FEATURES, SMART, IDENTIFY, READ_SECTOR, WRITE_SECTOR.
Period.
Pretty easy to support those, especially in SATA.
I know, since I've just taken a couple of hours and added it
to my SATA/RAID driver (a queuing controller with tag support).
For more generic interface, Curtis's document looks rather good.
But for backward compatibility with existing tools like the
smartmontools and hdparm, all that is needed is a limited subset
of HDIO_DRIVE_CMD (for the opcodes listed above) and also
the closely related HDIO_DRIVE_TASK ioctl for some of the SMART
commands (all non-data).
Cheers
