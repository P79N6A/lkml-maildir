VT is just an instance of a tty driver, at least from the tty layer
viewpoint.

Its a bit more fundamental than that, there are various video side init
functions that are done before the module_init calls are made. The VT is
both a tty driver and a console.
The only real "magic" hooks in there are the resize one and the ioctl
hook. The resize one could easily be moved to be a tty driver method
that is usually NULL and would be a nice cleanup.
