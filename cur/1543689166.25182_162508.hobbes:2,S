Sorry, I did ask a college to type this info for me since I am
blind and can't read screen output at that early stage in the
boot process.  It seems he was very lazy.

Thanks you for reminding me!  I should have found this myself.
The problem was that I accidentally enabled ACPI CPU enumeration support
for HT.  Well, this is a pIII Mobile, and surely has
no Hyperthreading.
Now the machine boots fine.  Only "error" I saw in
dmesg is that my chipset is not yet supported for SpeedStep.
