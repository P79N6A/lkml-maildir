It works built-in and would continue to do so with this patch applied.
It's built into your kernel _automatically_ if anything built-in
requires it. That's done by the makefiles. Likewise, it's built as a
module automatically if anything modular in your tree requires it.
The config option is _only_ relevant if you are explicitly adding crc32
in the knowledge that you're going to build an _external_ module which
requires it.  
However, setting the config option to 'Y' when you have only _modular_
stuff which requires it is broken because it doesn't actually get pulled
in from lib/lib.a, because nothing references it.
