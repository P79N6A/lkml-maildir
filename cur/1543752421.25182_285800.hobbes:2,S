Exactly!
In fact it's not so heavyweight either.  A standalone UML binary which
just contains all the major filesystems and the core kernel is little
over 3Mbytes.  It's smaller than many binaries even without their
library dependencies.  It loads in less than a second...  The linux
kernel is still pretty nice and lean!
