Greetings,
I'm looking at the modules.isapnpmap and I compare it with modules.alias file.
For example:
-modules.isapnpmap:
snd-mpu401           0xffff     0xffff     0x00000000  0xd041     0x06b0
-EOF
-modules.alias:
alias:          pnp:dPNPb006*
-EOF
I am trying to resolve the isapnpmap into the alias. I figured most of it, but
I'm confused by the "PNP" part. It is obvious that vendor 0xd041 conforms to
"PNP", as all devices that have vendor 0xd041 have PNP and vice versa, similarly
for eg. vendor 0xa865 and "YMH"... 
However, how can I actually translate "PNP" to "0xd041" (and/or backwards)?
Thanks in advance for any reply.
