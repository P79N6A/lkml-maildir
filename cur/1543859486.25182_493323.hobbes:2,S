Hi Jens,
Sorry for the less explanation.

I don't understand the meaning of "lack of stacking" well but
I guess that it means "Is the existing hook in end_that_request_last()
not enough?"  If so, the answer is no.
(If the geuss is wrong, please let me know.)
The new hook is needed for error handling in dm.
For example, when an error occurred on a request, dm-multipath
wants to try another path before returning EIO to application.
Without the new hook, at the point of end_that_request_last(),
the bios are already finished with error and can't be retried.
Thanks,
Kiyoshi Ueda
