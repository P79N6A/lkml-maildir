Thanks!
Are there any plans to track it separately in a future kernel release?
I've also noticed that if huge pages are used for the shared memory,
they are not accounted for as cached - I have a 56GB huge page pool
but cached is only 6GB.  Is this behavior specific to huge pages?
Finally, are these quirks documented anywhere?
