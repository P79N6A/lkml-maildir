Hi Matt,
sorry for not answering your questions in the first place, i hope this 
did not mean to make a bad impression

I don't think so but you may be right nonetheless if my opinion.

It is needed for properly initializing a SSP guard which is (afaik) a 
long value.

Probably ... but bear in mind that the goal is still the same: allowing 
glibc to use SSP with /proc/self/auxv instead of fopen(/dev/urandom) as 
it is now.
Effectively saving three syscalls (open,read,close) and making life 
easier for glibc because randomization "generated" in the kernel does 
not deplete /dev/urandom too much for high coverage SSP userlands (i.e. 
Gentoo Hardened).
I can imagine that Redhat would do the same with the SSP implementation 
in glibc, i think if this patch moves into kernel, they will bring out a 
glibc patch that is checking for AT_ENTROPY and using the opening of 
/dev/urandom for retrieving randomized data as a fallback for machines 
where such a kernel is not available.  This is a win-win situation for 
both sides- the kernel wins because the pressure on /dev/urandom is 
released a bit (applicable to SSP environments) and the glibc wins 
because it has a reliable, fast, cheap and easy to use source for 
randomization.
Thank you,
Alex
