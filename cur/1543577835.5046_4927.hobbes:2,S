I suspect canadian law has similar precedents.

Yep. If religious fuckwits show up on my doorstep pandering their
salvation du jour and I point to the "no solicitation" sign, they can
either leave voluntarily on their own, or involuntarily in police
handcuffs.

You can change the channel or turn off the TV.

Perhaps, but I can always find another ISP. Of course, you could accept
spam/advertisements as a condition of service (eg free ISPs like netzero).
The key issue though is that you can always stop using the service and you
won't receive any more spam from them.
Spammers on the other hand continue sending
pr0n/make-money-fast/fraud-schemes even when told to stop. And most
relay-rape in order to send their spams. That's trespass.
And you're condoning this?
