This may be not ideal solution in case there exist both lower and
higher matches. If given resolution is closer (even by few pixels)
to lower one, your method will choose the lower one.
It may be incorrect for e.g. picture viewer (the higher resolution
shows the whole picture with margins, the smaller one shows
rescaled or cut picture).
IMHO, the choice of higher resolution (if possible) should be
preferred. It is also closer to the old solution.
Kind regards,
Krzysztof
