Because mtrr.c throws away the top 4 bits of 36-bit physical
addresses, it gives misleading /proc/mtrr output on machines with
>=4GB of memory, which I think requires a fix on its own.  But worse,
if it tries to make MTRR changes on such a machine, you can get bogus
MTRR settings. This can ruin a machine's performance (if real memory
ends up write combined or uncached) or give hardware instabilities (if
a device's MMIO area gets the wrong memory type).
So far, this probably hasn't bitten too many people, since relatively
few Linux x86 users have >=4GB memory, and /proc/mtrr hasn't usually
been altered without explicit intervention.  But with XFree86-4
finally "out there" and more kernel drivers using MTRRs, this can only
get worse.
(Whether Tigran's performance problems are actually down to the mtrr.c
issue, I don't know.  It's not worth hypothesizing until we have
accurate /proc/mtrr output.)
When I checked the 2.2 version of my patch, it didn't involve a
significant increase in code size.

Ok.  I'll wait for feedback from Tigran, and if I don't get anything
negative I'll submit to Linus.  The 2.2 version of my patch fixes
problems for other people, VA Linux have included it in their kernel
for a while with no problems that have been reported back to me), and
it's silly that it isn't in 2.4testX.  I should have addressed this a
while ago, but I have my own distractions from kernel hacking.
Later on, you can send a mtrr.c maintenance patch, if you like.
I've just caught up on this whole thread, and I don't have any
objections in principle to Zoltan's patch being used instead of mine,
though I'd like to take a look at it first.
Regards,
David
