hmm, I missed that.  Yes, the zone balancing in try_to_free_pages() will
see that all zones are above ->pages_high and will just return.

That would work.

Sure.
I'm not sure why swsusp needs "half of memory to be free"?  What's
the story there?
I'd recommend that you sit in a loop, allocating pages with an
allocation mode of
	__GFP_HIGHMEM | __GFP_WAIT
This will give you all the easily-reclaimable pages in the machine,
without trashing the page reserves (no __GFP_HIGH).
String all the pages together via page->list and when you have "enough",
free them all again.
