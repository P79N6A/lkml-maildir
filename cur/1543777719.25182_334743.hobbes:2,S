Subject: [RFC] [PATCH 0/4]Multiple block allocation and delayed allocation for ext3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi All, 
Here are the updated patches to support multiple block allocation and
delayed allocation for ext3 done by me, Badari and Suparna.
[PATCH 1/4] -- multiple block allocation for current ext3.
(ext3_get_blocks()).
[PATCH 2/4] -- adding delayed allocation for writeback mode
[PATCH 3/4] -- generic support for cluster pages together in
mapge_writepages() to make use of getblocks() 
[PATCH 4/4] -- support multiple block allocation for ext3 writeback mode
through writepages(). 
Have done initial testing on dbench and tiobench on a 2.6.11 version of
this patch set. Dbench 8 thread throughput result is increased by 20%
with this patch set.
dbench comparison: (ext3-dm represents ext3+thispatchset)

Todo:
- bmap() support for delayed allocation
- page reserve flag to indicate the delayed allocation
- ordered mode support for delayed allocation
- "bh" support to enable blocksize = 1k/2k filesystems
Cheers,
Mingming
