Some of the low end single zone machines (m68k, sparc32, arm etc)
could benefit from losing ->virtual too. wli has patches in
his dir on kernel.org that do this (and other struct page reductions)
The newer ones are against Rik's rmap vm though iirc, so you may have to
frob a bit to get them to play with the stock vm.
It'd be nice to see all these patches reducing this struct consolidated,
right now they're all ifdefing different bits with different names..
