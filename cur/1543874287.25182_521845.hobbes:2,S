A better way would be for MTD to deliver a block dev with a rich
enough interface for JFFS2 to use efficiently in the first place. Yes,
I know that can't be done with the current block dev layer. But that's
what the source is for.

And as I pointed out, you're wrong. It is both block oriented
(eraseBLOCK??) and random access. That's what a block device is. The
fact that it doesn't look like the other things that Linux currently
calls a block device and supports well is another matter.

No. Look at the picture for more than two seconds, please. 
I can tell you didn't do this because you didn't manage to find (1)
which explicitly says "with no smarts". And you also cut out the footnote
where I explained what I meant by "with no smarts".
Find the spots marked (2) and (3). These are your FTL.

...and if you'd actually looked at the picture, you'd have seen JFFS2
bypassing it. Along with another footnote explaining it.
