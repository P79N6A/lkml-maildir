No one is trying to take that away.  There is nothing that says you
can't boot with a small, 1-2 CPU 'boot' domain where you stick all those
tasks you typically put in a 'boot' cpuset.
<offtopic> In fact, people have talked before about reducing boot times
by booting only a single CPU, then bringing the rest online later.  This
work could potentially facilitate that.  Boot up just a single 'boot'
CPU.  All 'boot' tasks would necessarily be stuck there.  Create a new
'work' domain and add (hotplug on) CPUs into that domain to your heart's
content. </offtopic>
