Oops. Missed updating the rivafb driver. That is a easy fix. The current 
cursor api is focused on teh sofftware cursor. When I begain to program 
different hardware cursors I begain to realize it was a really bad design.
This patch breaks up the total cursor changes because it is quite big. 
P.S There is another bug I missed as well. 
I will send patches soon.
