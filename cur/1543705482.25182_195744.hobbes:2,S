Glad you agree.
From the anandtech website a description of the P4 Prescott (next generation 
IA32) with hyperthreading shows this with the new SSE3 instruction set:
"Finally we have the two thread synchronization instructions – monitor and 
mwait. These two instructions work hand in hand to improve Hyper Threading 
performance. The instructions work by determining whether a thread being sent 
to the core is the OS’ idle thread or other non-productive threads generated 
by device drivers and then instructing the core to worry about those threads 
after working on whatever more useful thread it is working on at the time."
At least it appears Intel are well aware of the priority problem, but full 
priority support across logical cores is not likely. However I guess these 
new instructions are probably enough to work with if someone can do the 
coding.
