i have 2 questions:
1) how to debug this, to confirm that this is caused by NFS server not
   sending unique cookies? (to try to report to the "vendor" of the
   NFS server)
2) does it make sence to try to gracefully work-around this problem on
   the linux side? or would it significantly complicate things?
Best,
v.
