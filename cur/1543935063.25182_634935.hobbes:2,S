There is no dump_stack() here, but disc detection is relatively early in boot 
process and on all these information are already scrolled off screen when the 
panic is done. For this and any other panic it would be optimal if scrolling 
still would work, but scrolling also requires kernel code, so I see there's a 
reason not to this for all panics. However, for this boot problem I tend to 
say there's no need to panic at all...
Btw, not all stack straces are useless, *most* of them are actually very 
useful.
Cheers,
Bernd
