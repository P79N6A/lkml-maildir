this is interesting. I'm also wondering what you'd get if you used:
	echo 8 > /proc/sys/vm/vm_scan_ratio
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/vm_mapped_ratio
	echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/vm_balance_ratio
(or also the other combination that I suggested in the other emails)
Anyways you can probably skip the above test and wait for a further
update that changes more than just the default sysctl values (also
notably it introduces the PG_launder logic originated from a discussion
with Marcelo and Linus, resemling somehow part of the PG_wait_for_IO
write throttling logic that I had in 2.4.12aa1 and 2.4.13pre3aa1, but I
doubt pre3aa1 was slower because of that, and in case next -aa will
slowdown again I'll later ask you to try with a one liner patch that
will disable the write throttling for writepage again [like pre5aa1 did]
just to make sure it's not the one that hurts :)
thanks to you too for the feedback!
Andrea
