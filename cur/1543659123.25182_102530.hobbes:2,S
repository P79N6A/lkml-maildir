You are making all users of functions manipulating /proc condentional.
A simpler approach would be to make the functions that actually
minipulate /proc conditional.
For example snd_info_card_create() could be a noop if CONFIG_PROC_FS
is not defined.
Then you minimize the number of #ifdef's, and they are placed logically
where they belongs.
Furhtermore you make less code conditional which imply that the execution
path - and thus code getting more test - is more similar for the two cases.
