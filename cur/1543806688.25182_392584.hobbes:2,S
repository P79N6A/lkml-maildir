Yes, that is it.  I have tried using "long" and "unsigned int" for those
first parameters and it produces exactly the same assembler output on
ppc64 and x86_64.  Everywhere else that we have a file descriptor argument
to a compat syscall function it is declared "unsigned int".
And for these compat functions, alpha is irrelevent of course. :-)
