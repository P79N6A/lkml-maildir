These are essentially the same, they both rely on draining the downstream 
queues.  But if we could keep the downstream queues full, bus transfers for 
post-barrier writes will overlap the media transfers for pre-barrier writes, 
which would seem to be worth some extra effort.
To keep the downstream queues full, we must submit write barriers to all the 
downstream devices and not wait for completion.  That is, as soon as a 
barrier is issued to a given downstream device we can start passing through 
post-barrier writes to it.
Assuming this is worth doing, how do we issue N barriers to the downstream 
devices when we have only one incoming barrier write?

Daniel
