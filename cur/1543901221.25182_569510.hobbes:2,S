Subject: Q: a bogus task_running() check in try_to_wake_up() ?

try_to_wake_up:
	if (p->se.on_rq)
		goto out_running;
	...
	if (unlikely(task_running(rq, p)))
		goto out_activate;
How it possible that rq->curr has on_rq == 0 ?
AFAICS, this can only happen if this task is rq->idle. But idle threads
should not sleep, we have a special "scheduling from the idle thread!"
check in schedule().
Thanks in advance,
Oleg.
