Subject: When to use a freezeable workqueue?

In which situations is create_freezeable_workqueue() to be preferred
over create_singlethread_workqueue()?
Is a freezable worqueue preferable whenever the worker thread /can/ be
frozen, or is it only to be used if the thread /must/ be frozen during
suspend?
Thanks,
