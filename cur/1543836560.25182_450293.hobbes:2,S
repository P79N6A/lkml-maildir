What is really poisonous is structures which get padded when all the 
members are naturally aligned.  Unfortunately gcc produces really crap 
code with __attribute__((packed)) on some architectures, so just using 
that isn't a good solution.  On the other hand, non-AEABI ARM sometimes 
needs it!
For the lack of a __attribute__((nopad)) that would throw a warning or 
error on excessive padding, I fear that our best option is an __abi 
annotation which would enforce certain rules using sparse, and 
presumably provide __attribute__((packed)) on ARM:
- All padding must be explicit.
- All members must be naturally aligned.
- No unportable constructs, like non-int-sized bitfields.
