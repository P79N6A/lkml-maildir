For most cases they'll be identical.  The difference is whether you're
comparing the fsgid or the egid.  The former is what's used for file
access, the latter might make more sense in your case.  However, in
99.9% of the cases you care about fsgid == egid, so it's a wash.  So,
in_egroup_p matches a bit better.  Relative to the other patches...
thanks,
