I would say that it's "less elegant" to have to depend on yet another (big, 
complex, still evolving) library just to read out system metrics.

Indeed.

Yep.

4. Stability - A good XML parsing library cannot be "simple" or "small". At
least not when written in C   ;)
5. Lack of benefits - we already have structure because of the filesystem in
which the information would live. The actual "tags" could be so incredibly
simple that using XML would just be shooting birds with tactical nukes. E.g.
lots of fun, but a little expensive and not really necessary.
But maybe I'm just a pessimist and should stop bitching and start coding  ;)
