You seem to think "realtime" computing has a wishy-washy definition. 
Not so.
One of the key points of a realtime system is that any latencies be
bounded.  That's something you'd have one hell of job claiming for a lot
of OS/app combinations.  Don't mistake "usually adequately fast" for
"realtime".
