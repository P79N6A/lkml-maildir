Hi Balbir,
That was what I wanted to do at first, but there was some concern over whether
it would affect any of the intervening function calls.  If there's no
particular reason why the tsk->exit_code assignment is placed where it's at
now, then yes, I would much rather move it to before taskstats_exit().
I looked at the following functions involving tsk:
  exit_mm
    mm_release
      deactivate_mm
  exit_sem
  __exit_files
  __exit_fs
  cpuset_exit
  exit_keys
and don't see anything that setting exit_code would affect.  What do you think?
Jonathan
