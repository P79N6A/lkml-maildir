Drifting slightly off-topic:
I'm no expert on life-critical systems, but I've been told that it's
common for such projects forbid the use of interrupts and dynamic
memory allocation, so as to increase the system's predictability (at
the expense of flexibility).  If that's true, then Linux will probably
never end up in charge of airliner control surfaces.
On the other hand, there is a spectrum of reliability requirements.
Commercial aviation is way up near the top.  Even if Linux can't reach
that (and I'm not saying it can't -- like I said, I'm no expert),
there's got to be a large 'market' for highly (but not perfectly)
reliable systems.
