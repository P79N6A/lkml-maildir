The 2.4 kernel has reached a maintainance-only point so there is no way
lm_sensors could be officially merged into it now, especially since the
i2c layer itself would have to be significantly reworked before.
So your options are either to patch your 2.4 tree using the i2c patch
and additional drivers we provide, or to jump to Linux 2.6.
