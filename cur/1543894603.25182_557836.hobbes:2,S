You think so?
If even linking was considered 'mere aggregation on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium', then when would the 'But when you
distribute those same sections as part of a whole...' bit _ever_ apply?
It _explicitly_ talks of sections which are independent and separate
works in their own right, but which must be licensed under the GPL when
they're distributed as part of a larger whole.
I don't see how we could hold the view that _even_ linking is 'mere
aggregation on a volume of a storage or distribution medium', without
conveniently either ignoring entire paragraphs of the GPL or declaring
them to be entirely meaningless.
Of course, that doesn't mean that a court _wouldn't_ do that. Given
enough money, I'm sure you could get US court to declare that the world
is flat. But it doesn't seem to be a reasonable viewpoint, to me. Or a
likely outcome.
