There is linux-fbdev@vuser.vu.union.edu list. You may want to subscribe/ask
there.

Old 88800GX boards are powered on with disabled MMIO and this MMIO cannot
be enabled through PCI, but must be enabled through io port 0x6AEC (and
this effectively disables multihead). Another problem is that there
are couple of DACs on these ATIs and driver supports only two of them -
- IBM RGB 514 and ATI 68860 B...
So unplug card from computer and look at it. If you'll find 'CH8398' on
the board, try patch
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/2.3.5/atyfb.gz
 (as path indicates,
it is for kernel 2.3.5. I throwed device away after that and replaced
it with yet another matrox). It worked for me in the intel box...
                                            Best regards,
                                                    Petr Vandrovec
