ok. the topic code is low-prio as these chips works mostly w/o the patch.
my craptop just fucks up in 1 of 30 boots or so.

yes, i saw that too, but copy-pasted from the other overrides to fix up
in the next patch...i think ->init should always point to yenta_init,
the additional init function should be called from inside there, before
activating the interrupts...wanna have a patch?

ps: in a few days, when i get my other laptop back, i have access to one of
those TI chips with all the nice problems (ie. under FreeBigStinkyDaemon the
machine dies under an interrupt storm when activating the socket) so i could
also test the irq routing and other fixes a bit.
