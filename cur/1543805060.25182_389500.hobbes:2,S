It's not a thread group ID at all. It's a task ID or thread ID.
The thread group ID is something different. It's the same as
a POSIX process ID. The kernel uses "tgid" as the name.
At least you're not alone in your confusion. :-)

This is sort of a bug really, though we're probably stuck
with it now. You should get errno=ESRCH when you use
an ID that does not match up with a tgid.
The "feature" doesn't work for thread group leaders
because kill() doesn't let you specify that you really
want to address the task rather than the task group.
We have tkill() and tgkill() to address this problem.

That would be wrong for most signals. The kernel follows
the POSIX behavior, with "process" being struct signal or
the tgid. A few signals, like SIGKILL, go the the whole process.
All others are delivered to the first task willing to take it,
which is how POSIX treats a process with threads. (there
is also different behavior for per-task stuff like SIGSEGV)

Aside from bugs, no.

They sure do, unless you play with abnormal clone() flags.

That's not at all weird. It fits perfectly with the use of the tgid
as the POSIX PID and the use of the "pid" (ugh) as the POSIX
thread ID.
Aside from POSIX just being arguably weird, the only weird
things here are:
1. kill() not returning errno=ESRCH when it should
2. the name "pid" being used oddly in the kernel
