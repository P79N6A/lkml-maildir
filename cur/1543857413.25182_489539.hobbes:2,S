The question is if the slab allocator is only doing 2^0 order
allocations for the 256-page bio_vec currently - it's at 4096 bytes, so
potentially (I suspect) the worst size it could be.
On the 1 vs many page bio_vec patterns, I agree with Nate. I do see lots
of larger bio_vecs here. > 1 page bio_vec usage is also becoming more
prevalent, not less. So optimizing for a benchmark case that
predominately uses 1 page bio's is indeed a silly thing.
