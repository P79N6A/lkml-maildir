Hi,
I am trying to install kernel 2.5.26 on a Sony Vaio R505DL to
take advantage of the new implemented i830m driver.  The problem
I am seeing is that the keyboard and mouse does not work.  I can
login remotely and everything is fine.
If I cat /proc/interrupts I don't see any interrupts listed for
the keyboard or the mouse?
Any ideas??
Thanks
ttyl
Dima
