This is the user-to-kernel interface for the kernel system calls. It
takes the system-call number, puts it into register eax as a function code
and executes the software interrupt 80 hex. Upon return, it checks for
a negative value, also in eax. If it is negative, it puts the
negative of the return value (now positive) into global errno, and
returns -1.
Note that this is a MACRO so substitution rules apply for 'type' and
'name' Type would be typically 'int' and 'name' would be system-call
number.
