you are describing a memory leak. at some point he must free (or 
otherwise reuse) these pages.
theoretically he could peek at the tcp sequence number, but an 
event-driven, protocol-agnostic completion seems better to me.
* light goes on *
yes, if he frees the pages immediately after tcp_sendpage, then the 
reference count would remain elevated until tcp completes sending these 
pages. so the sequence
  allocate pages
  fill with data
  tcp_sendpage()
  free pages
should be safe?
(I am still wishing for tcp aio, though)
