Okay. I think I have figured some things out.
With 2.5.69-bk4, I have ACPI and APM built into my kernel.
If I boot normally, ACPI loads first and I get timeouts and my USB 
trackball doesn't register with input.
If I boot with noacpi, I still have the same problem.
If I boot with pci=noacpi, I do *not* have the problem. I still have the 
timeout, but my trackball works. However, I have many lines of an 
acpi_irq handler and call trace with the comment 'irq 20: nobody 
cared!'. I also get 'APIC error on CPU0: 00(40)' and 'APIC error on 
CPU0: 40(40)' a couple dozen times each.
If I boot with noacpi *and* pci=noacpi, I have the all of the problems 
mentioned; no trackball and the pci=noacpi related problems.
Someone mentioned using noapic, but it doesn't have any effect.
Any questions?
Thanks,
David
