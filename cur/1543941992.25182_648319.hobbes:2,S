Both of these are easily handled if the server is 100% in charge of 
managing the filesystem _metadata_ and data.  That's what I meant by 
complete control.
i.e. it not ext3 or reiserfs or vfat, its a block device or 1000GB file 
managed by a userland process.
Doing it that way gives one a bit more freedom to tune the filesystem 
format directly.  Stable inode numbers and filehandles are just easy as 
they are with ext3.  I'm the filesystem format designer, after all. (run 
for your lives...)
You do wind up having to roll your own dcache in userspace, though.
A matter of taste in implementation, but it is not difficult...  I've 
certainly never been accused of having good taste :)

Nah, you're thinking about something different:  a userland NFSD 
competing with other userland processes for access to the same files, 
while the kernel ultimately manages the filesystem metadata.  Recipe for 
races and inequities, and it's good we moved away from that.
I'm talking about where a userland process manages the filesystem 
metadata too.  In a filesystem with a million files, ls(1) on the server 
will only show a single file:
[jgarzik@core ~]$ ls -l /spare/fileserver-data/
total 70657116

Don't get me started on "volatile" versus "persistent" filehandles in 
NFSv4...  groan.
