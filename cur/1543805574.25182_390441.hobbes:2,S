well, yes, but wouldn't that be the RightThing(tm) 
anway? because 'referencing' something via a pid, then
letting the task holding the pid go away and even be
replaced by a new one (with the same pid) which then
will get suddenly signaled from somewhere, just because
the pid matches seems very broken to me ...
