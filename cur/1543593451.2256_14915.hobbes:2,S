Funny. I can count many ways in which 4.3BSD, SunOS{3,4} and post-4.4 BSD
systems I've used were broken, but I've never thought that swap==2*RAM rule
was one of them.
Not that being more kind on swap would be a bad thing, but that rule for
amount of swap is pretty common. ISTR similar for (very old) SCO, so it's
not just BSD world. How are modern Missed'em'V variants in that respect, BTW?
