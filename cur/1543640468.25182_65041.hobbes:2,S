Hello
I have some fixes to OSS drivers...
All calls to synchronize_irq are missing an argument.. FIXED
changed all save/restore/cli/sti to their respective local_irq_xxxx
And some other casting and warnings stuff
After this patch i compiled all OSS drivers with just 2 warnings that i
dont solved yet..
thanks...
