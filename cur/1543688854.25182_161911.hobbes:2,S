Hello, I got it working now, thank you anyways. I got another problem 
straight ahead too.
My AGP works, but it's darn slow. I need it working probebly so I can 
use my linux again *sigh*.
I have a Nforce 2 chipset on my board. If I build Nforce2 support as a 
module or built in it causes a hang, and I need a hard reboot. I saw 
that if the module is loaded at startup it will cause a crash, but if I 
load it later, it wont affect the speed. So, it needs to be loaded in 
bootup, but it will cause a crash, you know something about this? When 
starting X it just crashes (And I can reproduce this without taining the 
kernel) so is Nforce2 support broken for my board?
Regards,
