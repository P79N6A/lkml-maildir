Subject: [RFC][PATCH] linux-2.5.59_lost-tick_A1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/1/25/58

All, 
	Here is the next rev of my lost-tick compensation code, which handles
the case where interrupts are disabled for longer then two ticks. This
patch solves the problem by checking when an interrupt occurs if
timer->get_offset() is a value greater then 2 ticks. If so, it
increments jiffies appropriately. 
New in this version:
o detect_lost_tick() is now static inlined
o printk warning messages the first 5 occurrences
o also show_trace() when displaying warning. 
I'd really like it if folks seeing the problem would take this for a
spin and let me know if it works for them. Also, any comments or
suggestions would be appreciated.
thanks
