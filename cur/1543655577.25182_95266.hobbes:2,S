I posted earlier about a problem with poor disk I/O and I've been
checking out /proc/partitions and was wondering what the units are for
the columns listed.  I've checked the Documentation directory and done
some Googling and haven't been able to find out what everything means.
Could someone give me a basic understanding of the data in
/proc/partitions, or point me to some docs that do?  Here is an example
from my system and it seems there is a lot of wio:
awk -F\  '{print $4 " " $9}' /proc/partitions
name wio
