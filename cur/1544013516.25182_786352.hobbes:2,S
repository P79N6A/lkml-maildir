Alas, my attempt to install a 32 bit version of xubuntu 8.10 under qemu hung 
at "Scanning files: 15%", and has been there for an hour now.  I'll have to 
take your word for it.  (All three scripts work fine under 64 bit dash.)
I encountered one bug in busybox, which I pinged that list about, but 
otherwise busybox ash works on 'em all too.
