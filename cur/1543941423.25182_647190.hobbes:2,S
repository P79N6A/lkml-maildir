This is the start of the stable review cycle for the 2.6.22.17 release.
There are 27 patches in this series, all will be posted as a response to
this one.  If anyone has any issues with these being applied, please let
us know.  If anyone is a maintainer of the proper subsystem, and wants
to add a Signed-off-by: line to the patch, please respond with it.
These patches are sent out with a number of different people on the
Cc: line.  If you wish to be a reviewer, please email stable@kernel.org
to add your name to the list.  If you want to be off the reviewer list,
also email us.
Responses should be made by Feb 5 2008, 00:00:00 UTC.  Anything received
after that time might be too late.
Note, I think this is going to be the last .22 release, unless people
send me some patches they think really needs to go in, and then, it will
probably only be one more release.  It's time to move on :)
thanks,
the -stable release team
