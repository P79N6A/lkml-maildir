I only did one case, to concentrate on the value for the last word.  A
full implementation has to cater for NR_CPUS < BITS_PER_LONG as well.

For big endian, ~0UL << NR_CPUS_UNDEF is right.  For little endian, it
depends on how you represent an incomplete bit map.  Is it represented
as a pure bit string, i.e. as if the arch were big endian?  Or is it
represented as a mapping onto the bytes of the underlying long?
