We do that in the module that also provides the device driver. E.g. hdaps or
thikpad-acpi will provide both the platform device (and register it), and
the driver.

In this specific case I am talking about, they're not.  ThinkPads are the
host.  The platform for a ThinkPad is either i386 or amd64.  But there are
many more hosts that are i386 or amd64 than ThinkPads, and the devices in my
example are thinkpad-specific.
I don't feel like drivers like hdaps, thinkpad-acpi, dock, bay, and many
others really belong in the platform bus.  But that's what happens right
now.
