One more point where it can help: When the backing store for the spufs
mem file changes between vmalloc memory backed and pointing to a physical
spu, we need to change vm_page_prot between (_PAGE_NO_CACHE | _PAGE_GUARDED)
and the opposite. While all my investigations (with help from Hugh Dickins
and Christoph Hellwig) show that it should be safe to do in the current
code, the idea is still scary. When the nopage function for that file
can simply return NOPAGE_RETRY after setting up the page tables,
we don't need to worry about vm_page_prot any more.
