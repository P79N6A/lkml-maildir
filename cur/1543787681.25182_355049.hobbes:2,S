Yes, I am looking forward to meet you and the rest of the netfilter developers 
again at the workshop next week too. The workshop has always been a lot of 
fun with a lot of interesting discussions. With the 2 days of the workshop 
and the 2 extra days of hacking on code there will probably be plenty of time 
to talk about the current state and future directions of the HiPAC project.
See you next week
