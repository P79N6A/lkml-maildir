What causes problems on _all_ of my softraid boxes is that without a  
whole bunch of pivot_root magic in the shutdown code to switch to a  
tmpfs and unmount my lvm-on-md-on-sata stuff, it's impossible to get  
the kernel to stop devices cleanly.  I get all sorts of messages from  
the kernel about trying to stop MD devices and not being able to  
_after_ reboot is called, even though at that point it should just  
forcibly kill all userspace, unmount all filesystems, and deconstruct  
the MD/DM device tree.  I see no reason why a successful shutdown or  
reboot call should _ever_ leave the disks in an inconsistent state.
