Subject: [PATCH] Add pci_device_shutdown to pci_bus_type
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/19/114

The extra compatability code is not necessary.  Any code still using
the old shutdown method will trigger the warning in driver_register()
instead.
Signed-off-by: Brian Gerst <bgerst@didntduck.org>
