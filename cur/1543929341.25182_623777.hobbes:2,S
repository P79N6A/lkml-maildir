The release dates of Linux kernels are much more deterministic than
the removal dates in feature-removal-schedule.txt are accurate.
The reason I see for this is that many list readers do not object
patches that extend frs.txt, but there is always 'a lot' of
resistance when actually attempting to remove code. raw.ko is
probably the best example.
This kinda defeats the purpose of frs.txt. If subsys maintainers do
not croak when they see patches that add to frs.txt (assuming the
maintainers see the patches, to be fair), I take it they agree to
removing the feature soon. If not, the textfile should probably be
renamed to features-we-would-like-to-get-rid-of-sooner-or-later.txt.
