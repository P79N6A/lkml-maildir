The plan is pretty rough at the moment, and not all of the code has
been written yet. Basically, it boils down to:
  Add the COW structure 'vfs_cred'
  Make VFS changes to replace all instances of
  current->fsuid/fsgid/ngroups/groups with a single 'vfs_cred' that
  never can be changed by CLONE_CRED after we call down into the VFS.
  This means that we have to actually invent mechanisms for passing
  those creds down to address_space_operations, inode_operations.
  Add the more volatile 'pcred' a.k.a. 'task_cred' (see below), which
  forms the necessary basis for CLONE_CRED tasks.
  Audit 'task_cred' to ensure that CLONE_CRED won't introduce new
  security holes. Things like capabilities, which can sometimes
  override 'standard credentials', will for instance need to be looked
  into.
  .... end of process -> add CLONE_CRED flag to 'clone()'

Dave and I have already been discussing this on l-k, and we appear now
to be in agreement on general procedure. Dave has said that he'd like
to contribute once we get vfs_cred well established. I'm hoping he'll
help out on the latter too ;-)

I'm fine about 'vfs'cred', but how about 'struct task_cred' instead
for the second? That ties them directly in to the task_struct, and
avoids people mistaking for 'ucred'. Since the distinction between COW
and non-COW is pretty profound, it might be useful in order to help
emphasize to which category they belong...
Cheers,
