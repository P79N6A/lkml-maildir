I had to replace this with
	for o in `echo $(sort $(local-objs-y))`; do \
and the like, since otherwise my shell (bash) would complain about an
empty "for o in ; do". Maybe there's a less hacky way to handle that? 
BTW, it'd be also nice if scripts/build-initcalls would add some \n's to
init/generated-initcalls.c ;)
The "unix" thing is stupid. The obvious way around that is 
-DKBUILD_MODNAME="unix", but unfortunately, I don't know of any 
"unstringify" preprocessing function, so that doesn't work easily, either.
Well, I cannot think of a nicer solution there (and I tried ;), other than
these small issues things look very nice, though.
