According to Grover, Andrew:

I didn't try kernels between 2.4.0 and pre8, so I'm not sure when it
broke.  I suppose I could <shudder> try to narrow down exactly which
pre patch started to show the problem.
Actually, looking back at /var/log/messages, it's even worse than I
originally said.  It looks like for at least some early builds of
2.4.0 I was getting:
Jan  5 16:39:18 jhereg kernel: ACPI: System description tables found
Jan  5 16:39:18 jhereg kernel: ACPI: System description tables loaded
Jan  5 16:39:18 jhereg kernel:     ACPI-0281: *** Error: Ns_search_and_enter: Bad character in ACPI Name
Jan  5 16:39:18 jhereg kernel:     ACPI-0281: *** Error: Ns_search_and_enter: Bad character in ACPI Name
Jan  5 16:39:18 jhereg kernel: ACPI: Subsystem enable failed
Although for later 2.4.0 builds it worked OK.  I wonder what could be
doing this?  About the only things I played with during 2.4.0 builds
was updated reiserfs and LVM patches.
