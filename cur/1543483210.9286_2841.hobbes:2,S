	Yeah...  You probably used the older smbmount syntax.  Hint...
If the smbmount command did NOT contain a -c parameter followed by a
mount command in a string, you used the wrong syntax and that's why
you got dumped to an smbclient type prompt.  The samba smbmount is based
on an earlier smbclient program.  Eventually the syntax will get worked
out (primarily for the benefit of autofs) but until some other serious
autofs problems get worked out, I've got some things higher on ther priority
list.
