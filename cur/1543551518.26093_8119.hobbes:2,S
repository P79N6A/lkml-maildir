Yes it works, its not all that different from my patch ;). AFAIK its the
(!tpnt->present) that fixes the oops as it seems remove_proc_entry 
doesn't care wether this proc entry really exists or not. Adding
orig-present only saves some code from being executed. We should
keep it though, this might change in the future.
Linus would you mind incresing the Revision number in scsi.c when you
apply the patch.
