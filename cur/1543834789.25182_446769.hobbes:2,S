I don't see ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN defined for s390, what's up with that? I 
agree that we should always respect ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN no matter what. 
Does the included patch fix that for you?

[PATCH] slab: respect mandated minimum architecture alignment
The slab debugging code for SLAB_RED_ZONE and SLAB_STORE_USER require 
BYTES_PER_WORD alignment for the caches. However, for some architectures, 
the mandated minimum alignment might be bigger than that, so disable 
debugging for those cases instead of crashing the machine.
