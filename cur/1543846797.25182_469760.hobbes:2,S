No.  The point of the notes is so that the bootloaders can look
at the kernel and have a strong hint what the right thing todo is.
The reason for taking them out is that what needs to happen is that
we need to put the notes into vmlinux and then copy the notes in
vmlinux into the bzImage.   Taking the notes out just make way
for us to put them back in properly.

We need to figure out how to reproduce this.
