Huh? You are offering your fax emulation at
ftp://ftp.avm.de/fritz.box/tools/fax4box/
 for Windows to communicate over
Ethernet with the Fritz!Box.  You don't tell me that communicating over
Ethernet is more reliable than implementing it in user space?  Or is my
understanding about how this tool is working completely wrong?

It is perfectly understandable that you don't want to offer this special
know-how in public.  But isn't your implementation modular enough to open
source the drivers _without_ support for these analog services as a first
step?  This driver could then be shipped without problems enabling your users
to download a more advanced closed source module from your web site if desired
and you don't care about the license issues.
