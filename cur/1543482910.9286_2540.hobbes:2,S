First, you might find that you reach the right audience on the linux-parport
mailing list - go to 
http://www.torque.net/parport/
 to get started.  
Secondly, a bit more of a clue of what you are looking for or trying to 
do might help people to give you a better answer:   Your question covers
a lot of ground.  If, for instance, you are looking for the data sheets
for the common "super I/O" chips used on intel-based motherboards, you
can get some of them from manufacturers' web sites.  And then there's
the IEEE-1284 standard - which you'd have to buy from IEEE.
