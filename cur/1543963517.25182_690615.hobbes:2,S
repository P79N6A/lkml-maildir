Hi.
A week has passed the problem still persist and I have done a fair 
amount of testing.
I have now been able to reproduce it on 2 different servers, a 
dual-core,8 cpu Sun X4600 amd64 and a 2 cpu single-core Sun V20Z.
It has been reproduced against 4 different diskarrays one of them being
the IDE-SCSI(We have 2 of them) array mentioned before. The other one is
an iSCSI SAN. And lately when trying to move of the "trouble systems" we
hit the bug on a FC-SAN.
I belive that we can rule out hardware now.
I have both reproduced it on "old" ext3 volumes and freshly created
ones.
I havent been able to reproduce it on the internal system disks of
the servers, but thinking a bit more about the setup it seems that
the filesystem need to have a significant load on the
filesystem-structures (not data) to exploit the bug. The typical
environment where I found it was serving (the same) ~5GB of files of the
NFS-server to 48 dual-core machines, this bacically never hits the
actual disk (with 32GB of ram in the machine). In this setup
a single process could hit the bug on the server (the problem could
also be seen over NFS from the clients).
It is worth keeping in mind that the problem is "rare". Thus all
applications only opening and reading a single file every 10 minutes
or so probably never hits it.
Altering the test-script so it just tries again to pick up the file,
it succeeds on the second pass.
 From my perspective this defininately has something to do with how the
OS caches/invalidates the filesystem structures it has in memory (or
somewhere near that).
I still haven't been able to produce a small pack-and-shit test that
knocks the problem out on every system. But please come with suggestions
about how to write a piece of code that tries to hit the problem from
my descriptions.
My feeling is that the script below may reveal the bug on any "busy" 
volume, where busy is lots of activity in the OS-cache of the volume,
not on the actual drives.
All suggestions are welcome.
I have tried 4 different kernel versions:
2.6.20, 2.6.22, 2.6.24, 2.6.25.2
