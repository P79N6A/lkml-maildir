in this case this is really all the version information available ;(
it seems to be a patched kernel without patched EXTRAVERSION.
But in the future if I have more specific information (eg it's only 1 kernel version) I'll mention it in more detail.
It gets unwieldy if there's 500 reports for an oops of course ;)

I already always will mention if the oops is tainted or not (that I track specifically);
I'll keep an eye out for other non-tainting out of tree modules as well.
Thanks for the suggestions.
