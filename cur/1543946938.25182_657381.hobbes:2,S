Note that I'm explicitly avoiding commenting on this as far as PXA3xx
devices go, until we're further down the road with PM support on that
SoC.  It's not clear at present whether a generic PMIC framework will
be suitable for this SoC since it's my understanding from Marvell that
we need to talk to the PMIC from IRQs-off contexts.
So don't take my silence as some sort of acceptance of this code; it
isn't.
