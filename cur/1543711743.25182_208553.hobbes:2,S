set_page_dirty() takes ->tree_lock and inode_lock.  tree_lock surely is OK
and while I cannot think of any deadlocks which could occur with taking
inode_lock inside the rmap lock, it doesn't sound very nice.
It would of course be best if we could avoid adding a new ranking
relationship between these locks.
