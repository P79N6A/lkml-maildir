   I had a similiar problem if I compiled and installed the new kernel
image while running v2.3.22.  My computer just hung after decompression
but, it is also just a 486.  It seems(to me) a filesystem bug in 2.3.22
was causing LILO to address the kernel image incorrectly.  I solved my
problem by going back to an earlier kernel version (v2.3.18) and
recompiling and installing 2.3.23 after which I had no problems.
   Just for kicks, I tried going from 2.3.22 -> 2.3.24 when it came out
and had the same problem.  Going from 2.3.23 -> 2.3.24 worked just fine.
   Reverting back to 2.3.18 wasn't a problem for me since I always keep
2 or 3 images around.  Hopefully you do the same and can give this a try
without too much headache.
