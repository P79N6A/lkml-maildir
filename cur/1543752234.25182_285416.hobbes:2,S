What if the policy associated with a vma is the default policy?
Then the page will be swapped in on the node that took the page
fault -- this is >>probably<< correct in most cases, but if a
page is accessed from several nodes, and predominately accessed
from a particular node, it can end up moving due to being swapped
out, and that is probably not what the application intended.
