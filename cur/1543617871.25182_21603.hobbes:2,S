Im not sure aiming at least important is worth anything. Aiming at idle 
processors on a box not doing power management seems easy providing you'll
accept 99.99% accuracy. Switch the priority up in the idle code, switch it
back down again before the idle task schedule()'s. If you hit during the
schedule well tough.

Thats another reason to keep it small and clean.
