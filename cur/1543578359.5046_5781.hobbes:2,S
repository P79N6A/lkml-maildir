The fact that they all give the same value does not indicate that you have not 
been cracked. Obviously, part of the hacking is to cover trails; it'd be a 
pretty poor job if they reported different values.
The mm stuff from your other message is, I think, an indication that you might 
be being hit by a memory management bug that was corrected in 2.2.19pre2.
It is my sincere belief that you will need to upgrade your kernel, but you are 
in no serious danger.
If it's a firewall box, you should be running tripwire or some free variation, 
to help eliminate the possibility that cracking would go undetected.
