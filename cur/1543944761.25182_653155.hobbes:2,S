No, they share the same interrupt line...
So, while the timer interrupt handler is running, the serial handler
has to wait until the timer interrupt handler has finished.
Notice that the HRT interrupt handler is quite heavy and takes a long
time to complete.
And, as I already mentioned, related to the 1 byte FIFO and a
interrupt latency of about 85us (without HRT), it is logical that you
can get an overrun at the higher serial speeds... (>=115200bps)

Or, use flow control?
Kind Regards,
