OK, good point.  My logic was wrong when I considered RCU.  But now I
don't understand what you meant by "it cannot work" when you wrote
this in your previous email:
    Andi> If you wanted to fix it properly better make it use RCU -
    Andi> but it cannot work for the case of calling a compat handler.
Based on what you just wrote, it seems to me like RCU would actually
work fine.  Is this wrong?
Thanks,
