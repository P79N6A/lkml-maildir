So you have uid-group scheduling and RT-group scheduling enabled (a
feature that's experimental for real and has never been enabled by
default), looking at the sys_setuid() code, the real uid change is done
by switch_uid() and that doesn't have a failable scheduler hook.
The thing is, I suspect the uid you switch to doesn't have a RT runtime
quota configured, therefore the RT task that gets placed in it by
switch_uid() doesn't get to run.
[ Please read Documentation/scheduler/sched-rt-group.txt
  when you enable RT group scheduling ]
The correct thing would be for switch_uid() (or set_user) to fail with
-EINVAL, much like cpu_cgroup_can_attach() currently does for cgroup
grouping.
After that it demonstrates a bug in your test program, which fails to
check errors ;-)
