Subject: [PATCH 1/2][IPX] Remove outdated information from Kconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

SPX was removed in early 2.5. How to connect to a Mac or the other OS isn't
hard to find out these days.
