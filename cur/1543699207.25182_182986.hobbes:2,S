Has anyone gotten their hands on any Silicon Image 3124 hardware?  It was 
announced 3 months ago and supports PCI-X plus it's designed to support 
whatever the final SATA 2.0 spec ends up being.  Full NCQ support.

Hot-Plug seems like one of the most universally supported features.  What will 
it take to get it working?  And what will it take to get it working on 2.4?  
Is that a major feature we'll just have to wait for in libata?
I personally need hot-swap on production servers.
