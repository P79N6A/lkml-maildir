Most interrupt controllers can read back IRQ's to see whether it is
active. A shared IRQ would be readback active while any device
connected to it desires service.
x86 example for 8259A AT-PIC's Returns the state of IRQ0-15 in ax
Note that jmp $+2 is only needed on some old 286/386 hardware
to meet (real) 8259A cycle time requirements.
- Intel syntax :)
	mov	al,0ah
	out	0a0h,al
	jmp	$+2
	in	al,0a0h
	mov	ah,al
	mov 	al,0ah
	jmp	$+2
	out 	20h,al
	jmp	$+2
	in 	al,20h
