I am resubmitting this because it seems to be lost when I posted

My computer with Athlon K7 was faster with manually prefetching,
but I did not know it is already becoming obsolete.
It was pretty while ago, but I also made a similar copy_user function;
http://www.suna-asobi.com/~akira-t/linux/k7-copy-user/K7-copy-47.patch
I add comments on each item in the copy function. It was basically 
inspired from Takahashi's intel faster copy function.
I also have some explanation about the speedup for pipelined cpu.
