Two other choices:
a. map anon memory over the old mapping
b. fail the revoke() call, perhaps with EBUSY

What about using a signal with enforced action?
(like SIGSTOP and SIGKILL) The user could still
install a handler, but only to know when revoke()
has taken action. I have a feeling that this would
be less trouble, since the losing process performs
action on its own data structures.
BTW, one must watch out for dup2() in another thread.
