How would you add to a lock with just holding a lock for a task?  When
you are grabbing a lock, you must first grab a raw lock associated to
the lock being grabbed.  Although, I'm starting to look into this idea,
and I'm going to first see if the current wait_lock could suffice.  I
may also need to add an additional lock to the task to follow the lock
-> task -> lock route.  The tasks order should be the same as the locks
when the are bound (holding) a lock. Since the task won't be able to
release it without holding the raw lock of the lock it is releasing.
(boy this gets confusing to talk about, since you need to talk about
locks and the locking method within the lock!)

If I do need to add an additional lock to the mutex, I would abstract it
all, so that the old global pi_lock can be used if configured.  This
way, a UP or a low memory 2x SMP machine can still use the old method,
but when it needs to grow, switch over to the new non-global pi_locking
method.  But, maybe I can still get away with just using the wait_lock
and not add any more overhead to the size of the mutex.
I've just started to expiremnent with this idea, so I really don't know
yet how this will work.
