the current "checkpatch.pl" script rejects this notion and requires that you use 
tabs whenever you can (you can still align code within the length of one tab).
Since in the example part (2) above there are 9 spaces needed to go from err to 
arg_d, it complains if you had used 9 spaces here. It only allows you to use 
tabs + n spaces (where n < 8)
I personally prefer spaces, but the checkpatch.pl script does not agree, much to 
my dismay :(
