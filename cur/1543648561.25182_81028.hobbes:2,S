I can't let this go by without recommending "Linux Device Drivers", which
covers much of the kernel API.  Available at your favorite bookstore, or
online (under the FDL) at: 
http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/index.html.
Of course, I'm a little biased on that one...
Other worthwhile books include "Understanding the Linux Kernel," also
published by O'Reilly (though it's a little behind the times now), and
"ia-64 Linux Kernel," which is well worthwhile even if you have no interest
in the ia-64 architecture.
