I meant that you can't use proxy certs for your own use, so you still need 
to store your own cert/key somehow...and I still believe that the kernel 
keyring is the best place...

swap-out to disk, ptrace, coredump all become non-issues. And in 
combination with some other security features (such as disallowing 
modules, read/write of /dev/mem + /dev/kmem, limited permissions via
SELinux, etc), it becomes pretty hard for the attacker to get your 
private key even if he/she manages to get access to the root account.

How would you do it otherwise?
