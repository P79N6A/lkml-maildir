Hi there,
While booting with a 2.3.18ac7 kernel i get this message which goes on and on and on......
kmod: failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k binfmt-464c, errno: 8
kmod: failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k binfmt-464c, errno: 12
My 2.2.12 kernel with the S3 patch boots fine. And earlier I had mailed that my 2.3.18ac7 kernel
was not booting with an error [block-major-3] not found. This was rectified if I compiled Enhanced
IDE support into the kernel. I don't understand one thing here. Why is it that Enhanced IDE support
can be compiled as a module when it is useless ( kernel doesn't boot ) because unless it is compiled
into the kernel, the kernel won't boot !!
 
Could anyone enligthen me here !!
TIA
Regards
Avenger
