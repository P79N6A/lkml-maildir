Use a file system that is designed for use on FLASH devices.  In general 
FLASH devices are not very useable for systems that need to modify data 
on the disk often.
You may wish to look at the virtual memory file system available in the 
kernel if you have enough RAM.  You would mount your CompactFlash device 
read only and have all updates go to the virtual memory filesystem. 
When you want to commit the changes, remount the CompactFlash read/write 
and save the changes then remount it read only.
You would be surprised how fast a million writes can happen on a disk.
