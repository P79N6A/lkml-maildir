Well, _that_ is a separate issue. I have no idea what the NTFS filesystem
low-level layout is, and for all I know it may have its own trouble. But I
don't actuall ysee the "hardlink+complex file" thing as a very hard thing
to do necessarily: the hard link part implies that there is just one
"inode" (whatever NT calls them), and then the complex behaviour is just
described by that (rather complex) single inode.

Well, that proposal I obviously have no trouble with at all. I think it's
a swell idea. I don't think it's necessarily the only way of doing things,
but I certainly agree that it seems to be a clever trick that gets around
a lot of problems in the implementation.

[ Thinking about it ]
I don't think you necessarily need to fix even that.
I'm not positive that you even need a new "struct super_block". You could
use the same superblock, and just move some more information into the
vfsmount. Which _is_ easy to allocate, and doesn't have any of the
anon-mount list issues that the superblock has.
Besides, you _do_ want to have some good way to reach the underlying
superblock anyway, even from such a "sub-mount". Just sharing the sb
directly would be one easy way.
(No, I haven't checked all the details. There may be overriding reasons
why you'd not want to re-use the same superblock. And there may be tons of
small details too).

I think it at the very least has to be somewhat automatic to be nicely
usable.  But an autofs-like thing might be sufficient.
