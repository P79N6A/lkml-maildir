At the moment I just care a lot more about getting the API straightened
out.  An asynchronous incomplete/unsafe API is still an
incomplete/unsafe API.
BTW, I've botched the x86-on-x86_64 support.  I have a patch but need to
patch it before I'll submit v3 of the patch set.  If you want to work on
the patch and get syslet support going, let me know, I'll send the
latest version.
