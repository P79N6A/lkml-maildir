The modules side could possibly be explained by a possible h/w clash, with
the printer support loaded later than something which it may be clashing
with if loaded first - although I am a bit out of my depth in terms of
my understanding of the kernel boot process here. However, what is
interesting is that I originally had the problems when I upgraded to
the 2.4 kernel (and RH 7.1). I subsequently upgraded the h/w from a
PII 333 on a Tyan m/b to a P4 1.5G on an Asus m/b. The former was a mixed
PCI/ISA board, with both types of cards installed, whereas the latter
was all PCI. I had the same printer problem on both boards with kernel 2.4,
which makes the possibility of a h/w clash being the cause a bit remote.
The 2 changes above (I have not yet had a chance to try each in isolation)
fixed the problem.
