That sounds good. But we loose the advantage of doing limited debugging
with gdb. Crash (or other analysis tools) will still take considerable
amount of time before before they are fully ready and tested.
How about giving user the flexibility to choose. What I mean is
introducing a command line option in kexec-tools to choose between ELF32
and ELF64 headers. For the users who are not using PAE systems, they can
very well go with ELF32 headers and do the debugging using gdb.
This also requires, setting the kernel virtual addresses while preparing
the headers. KVA for linearly mapped region is known in advance and can
be filled at header creation time and gdb can directly operate upon this
region.
