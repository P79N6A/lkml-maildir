I'll follow up to myself before anyone gets too deep into debugging my
"problem".  My initialization scripts assumed that the tulip card would
be detected second and would become eth1.  This is true in 2.3.47 and
previous.  In 2.3.99 the tulip card is detected first and becomes eth0
while the Boomerang card for my LAN becomes eth1.  I was trying to get a
cable modem dhcp lease from a Win98 box locally which obviously didn't
work.
I wonder if there is a way to force the sequence in a particular way or
do I need to play games with grep, cut, and friends?
