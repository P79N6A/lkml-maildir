Subject: [Patch 2/4] cpusets simplify cpus_allowed setting in attach

When reattaching a task to a different cpuset, I had
code that attempted to preserve the cpuset relative
placement of the task (such as might have been done
using sched_setaffinity, mbind or set_mempolicy) by
rebinding the task to the intersection of its old
and new placement, if not empty.
This resulted in strange and puzzling behaviour, such
as having a tasks cpus_allowed not change if the task
was reattached to the root cpuset.
Simplify the code - when attaching a task to a cpuset,
simply set its cpus_allowed to that of the cpuset.
This is much less surprising in practice.
