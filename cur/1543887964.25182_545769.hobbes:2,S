Well, that itself is a suggestion.

Another command to /proc/scsi/scsi isn't a bad thought at all, considering
we're not _inventing_ a *new* /proc/not-related-to-processes interface, but
simply extending one that already exists. But then James / others are also
somewhat justified in shooting that down. I bet a lot of people would find
that even worse than this whole module affair.
