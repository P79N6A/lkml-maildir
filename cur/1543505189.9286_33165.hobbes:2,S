I wouldn't be at all surprised either way - I've seen too much code
that makes hidden assumptions like that for anything to surprise me
nowadays.

OK. I'll be basing the rest of my work on the assumption that the
patch I've already sent you applies before anything I send - ie, the
next patch will be incremental to that one.

Noting the comments about INT 0x15 not being able to access beyond the
16M mark, and noting that the kernel gets loaded at the 1M mark, I was
looking at the following semantics:
 Q> kernel_size = (size + 15) >> 4
 Q> if (kernel_size <= 0xffff)
 Q>     syssize = kernel_size
 Q> else if (make_zImage)
 Q>     die("Kernel too large for zImage loader")
 Q> else if (kernel_size <= 0xeffff)
 Q>     syssize = 0xffff
 Q> else
 Q>     die("Kernel too large for INT 15 loader")
 Q> endif
I would then tweak the code as compiled in the `make bzImage` case to
use the kernel_size field rather than the syssize field, and the code
in the `make zImage` case to use the lower two bytes thereof instead
of the syssize field. That would leave the syssize field effectively
unused...
Note that it stores the paragraph count in kernel_size as well as in
the current syssize field, rather than the actual byte size as in your
case. This is in my opinion preferable as the rest of the routine
deals in paragraphs at the moment, so is likely to simplify the
resulting code somewhat.
 > Not that I think it matters much.
It probably doesn't, but we can at least kill the bugs therein.
One thing though: I have to admit that my assembly experience has
primarily been with INTEL assembler, and in particular the A86
assembler's version thereof, so I'm not fully au-fait with the syntax
used by as86. I noticed the .byte and .word macros for declaring
variable storage in bootsect.S but is there one to declare a variable
with 4 bytes of storage as well, or do I need to use the ".word 0,0"
format?
Best wishes from Riley.
