Well reiserfs is probably a very bad choice at this point.  It
does not have any bad blocks support (yet), so as soon as you have
a bad block you are stuck.
You should probably use ext2, along with the badblocks program to
check which blocks in the disk are bad.  It will do a read-write
test, and either your disk will remap the bad blocks, or they will
be detected.
Even so, keep your backups current...
Cheers, Andreas
