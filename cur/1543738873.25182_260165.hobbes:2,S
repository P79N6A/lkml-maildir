No, just wait and your (everybody's) concern should be address. It takes
time to work through all of the slop. I'm all for syncing to a single
solution, but there's a ton of problems that still need to be addressed.

Yes, the efforts are distant from each other and it's going to take time
to resolve it. I'm probably going to use Ingo's stuff in 2.6.9+, but my
stuff in 2.6.7 is useful as a specialized kind of test harness. I'll
have to think about what's the best way of resolving this. I agree on
these points.
