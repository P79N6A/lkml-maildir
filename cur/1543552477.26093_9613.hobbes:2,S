Maybe I overestimated the overhead of the pc-speaker sound driver. 
Still,
the quality is dubious due to the hardware.  Some case designers fit the
cheapest possible speaker / piezo-electric device in order to
minimize cost.  (It is only used for system beeps so why use something
expensive.  Who 
cares if there is scratching on a beep due to somthing located too near
the membrane...)
And don't even try asking a pc-case salesman about the quality of the
built-in speaker.
