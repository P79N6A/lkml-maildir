Hey folks -
In the 2.6 tree, the driver drivers/scsi/dpt_i2o.c has a #error in it that
prevents it from being compiled.  The note in the file is:
#error Please convert me to Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt
Is anyone actively working on converting this driver to 2.6?  I've
tried contacting the author, Deanna Bonds at Adaptec, but her email stopped
working.  I'm not sure if she's no longer with Adaptec, or changed her email
address so as to stop getting kernel questions. :-)
In either case, I have two boxen at home with the Adaptec SCSI RAID
controllers, and I'd like to move them from 2.4 to 2.6.  Can anyone help?
Thanks!
jas
