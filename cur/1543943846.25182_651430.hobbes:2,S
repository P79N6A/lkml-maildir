I just did, and while non-x seems stable, the latest nvidia driver, about a 
week old, will not build a valid kernel module, so X bails out with a failed 
to load it, even though its sitting  
in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/video with exactly the same length 
as the one built for 2.6.24.  The nvidia-installer log recommends doing 
a 'make prepare' which I did, but nvidia still errors out during the module 
build.  So obviously I am back to 2.6.24, and my next stop is the nvidia web 
site to see if they have a fix.
Other than that, it feels good.
