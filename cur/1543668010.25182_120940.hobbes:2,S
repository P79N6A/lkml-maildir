Well the internal busses and buffers of modern CPU's and in many cases also 
the on-die caches have ECC logic.  And if i should hazard a guess: "Restart 
IP valid" => Restarted Instruction Pre-Fetch resulted in a valid state of the 
pre-fetch queue.
In Larry's case i'd remove the cpu cooler, clean everything and reassemble, 
since i would assume that there is a hot-spot on the die.
