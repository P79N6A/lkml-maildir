And local_irq_restore() and various other things.

I'd have thought that the way to do this would be to add it to lockdep -
lockdep already has all the infrastructure and code sites to do this.
Set some special flag saying its-ok-to-enable-interrupts-now and test that
in lockdep.
akpm:/usr/src/25> grep LOCKDEP arch/powerpc/Kconfig

losers ;)
Still, doing it for
akpm:/usr/src/25> grep -l LOCKDEP arch/*/Kconfig 
arch/arm/Kconfig
arch/avr32/Kconfig
arch/mips/Kconfig
arch/s390/Kconfig
arch/sh/Kconfig
arch/sparc64/Kconfig
arch/um/Kconfig
arch/x86/Kconfig
should give pretty good coverage.
