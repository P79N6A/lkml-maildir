eh, the alignment and size of the buffer have basically the same
restrictions of running read/write on a raw device, with the only
difference that for rawio the granularity is the hardblocksize, while
for O_DIRECT the granularity is the softblocksize of the filesystem.
We'll have to relax the granularity of the I/O down to the hardblocksize
for O_DIRECT too eventually.
