yes, i think, that vanilla kernel realy miss such an thing. personaly i don't even would call it extension,
because it's just missing part of the kernel, which should be here from the begining of `bind` option. now behaving
of mount one_dir into_another -o bind,ro is a least missleading, because it just _silently_ ignores the read-only option mounting read write.
nobody would even assume, that it is mounted read write. bind mounting should just work like any other.
