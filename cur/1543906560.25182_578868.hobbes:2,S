I'm not sure this is needed... Marcin got this patch, I hope, and I
don't have another possibility to contact with him. Since he managed
with this bisection and all the previous patches I don't think there
could be any problems, so:
Marcin! I'd be very glad if you could test this patch alone; this
should apply without any problems to 2.6.21 (with some offset) and
later "vanilla" versions (or try to revert Ingo's last patch with
patch -p1 -R). Please, contact me on any problems (alas not during
the weekend...).
Thanks,
Jarek P.
PS: of course, I'm very curious of this testing too, but, on the other
hand, as I've written earlier, I think this patch is needed for logical
reasons only, and it really doesn't look like it could make any damage
here.
