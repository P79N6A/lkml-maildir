USB UHCI driver could be a fine example of a regression -- it could survive
suspend in 2.4 under certain conditions, this is no longer true for 2.6.
There's also a great deal of people, who can't resume when AGP is being 
used -- that is again a regression over 2.4.
The above are major showstoppers for most laptop users that already got
used to stable and reliable swsusp and hence prefer to stick with 2.4.
