 I see similar behaviour on PPC as

I would say that something coded this bizarrely is really an application 
bug and not something that one could call a kernel regression. Any 
change in how the parent and child threads get scheduled will have a 
huge impact on this test. I bet if you replace that busy wait with a 
pthread_cond_wait or something similar, this problem goes away.
Hopefully it doesn't have to be pointed out that spawning off threads to 
do so little work before terminating is inefficient, a thread pool or 
even just a single thread would likely do a much better job..
