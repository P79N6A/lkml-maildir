Take path `/a/b' for example.  The original detry branch looks like
'/' -> 'a' -> 'b'  where the ino's are: 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
When nfsd then tries to rebuild the dentry it creates:
'/' -> '..' -> '..' where the ino's are 4, 3, and 2 respectively.
They are different paths.  (This isn't quite what happens, but it
is the basic idea.)
