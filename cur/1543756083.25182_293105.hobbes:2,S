So what does "lspci -v|grep HCI" say then?
You could try "mount -t usbfs on /proc/bus/usb" ... ;)
Periodically I think that it'd be useful to have the hub driver messages
report the HCD involved, somehow, instead of just "hub", at least when
root hub ports are involved.  It could improve the utility of some bug
reports by a significant amount.
