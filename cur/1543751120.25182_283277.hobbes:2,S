You should definitely bother your proprietary vendor all the time, they 
will then
see more clearly that they have to act fast _if_ they want to stay 
proprietary.

Do you follow -mm, -ac, and friends closely?  Most changes do happen in 
-mm first.
So you have time, all the way up to the next release.  Use that time to 
bug your
vendor about the imminent change.  There seems to be weeks between releases
now, plenty of time for a vendor to stay up-to-date.
