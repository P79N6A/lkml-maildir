This is my first mailing list post so Sorry for any breach of etiquette.
I am experiencing problems with 2.6.0-test9-mm3 and initrd ramdisks
I have support for ramdisks and initrd compiled directly into the kernel and have an initrd image gzipped and placed in /boot called initrd-crypt.gz
When booting off a 2.4.22 kernel the image is loaded and linuxrc is executed perfectly but with a 2.6.0-test9-mm3 kernel i get the following msg at boot time
	RAMDISK: Compressed image found at block 0
	RAMDISK: incomplete Write (-1 != 32768) 4194304
Any comments, advice, opinions greatly appreciated also if someone could explain what those numbers actually mean i would be very grateful 
Many Thanx,
Tim Kelsey
