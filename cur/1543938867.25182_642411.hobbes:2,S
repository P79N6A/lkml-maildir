Hi!
I have Asus p5b-v motherboard with Intel ICH8R + JMicron 20360/20363.
I am currently using zen-sources 2.6.24-rc7-zen2-g7c7e9c4a
(zen-sources.org) based on kernel 2.6.24-rc7. I have also these sources
directly with no solution to below problem (the mm-sources also don't help).
I have ATA turned off completely and SCSI stuff (generic, disk, cdrom) 
compiled in. SATA for Intel ICH8, AHCI also compiled in. JMicron PATA as a 
module.
I have SATA drive connected to SATA0 and Maxtor IDE drive + DVD burner 
connected to single IDE slot.
Booting this kernel off the SATA drive works perfectly, however the IDE drive 
is not found/put into /dev. However the DVD is properly recognized and 
created as sr0.
Is this known problem? I've looked all over google and found out that people 
have problems with CD/DVD drives with pata_jmicron but in my case DVD is 
working ok but HDD is not.
Is there a solution for this or can I give you more information to help me 
solve this?
Thank you for your time and patience.
