This patch for sys_call_table.c was merged into the main tree in this
changeset:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/cset@1.2080?nav=index.html
|ChangeSet@-2d
The patch fixes both the sys_call_table and the pud_alloc breakage, and
as of 2.6.11-rc3-bk2, the main tree compiles again for UML.
Andrew's tree, however, (at least 2.6.11-rc3-mm1) requires the patch I
sent out yesterday in the message titled "Fix compilation of UML after
the stack-randomization patches."
