Yes, but not in regard to the new key, which is what I thought you were
implying.
Besides, it's logically two operations: create key and link key to
keyring. The reason they have to be combined is that the key would be
immediately destroyed if it wasn't attached to a keyring.
The permissions check done on the keyring merely assures that the keyring can
be modified, not that a new key may or may not actually be created.
Maybe we're talking at cross-purposes here.

I meant the auditing service. Doesn't that use the security module hooks?
