Same over here. Got a new box with new harddisk yesterday, installed RedHat
6.0 (kernel 2.2.5 with many undocumented patches) and had the same problems.
Board: MSI 6161
Harddisk: Seagate ST34311A
After upgrading to vanilla kernel 2.2.13 there were slightly fewer errors
(compiling the kernel provokes 'em very reliably).
Digging in the source I found the following in drivers/block/ide.c:
         * A few rare drives vastly violate the 400ns spec here,
         * so we'll wait up to 10usec for a "good" status
         * rather than expensively fail things immediately.
This leads me to the impression, that this Seagate drive was one which even
exceeds this additional timeout. Increasing this additional timeout even more
didn't help so I gave up and got a RMA# from our distributor today. Tomorrow
I will get the replacement drive (same model) and re-check with this one.

Hm, could you verify wether all drives are Seagate? This looks being a common
point.

I don't think so. I was running the drive in standard, non-DMA mode.
