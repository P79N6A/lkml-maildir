It definitely does fix a bug: without the change, because
ops->destructor is shared (possibly with other net devices), IPoIB
ops->can't set it or clear it safely.  I don't have exact details at
hand but this was definitely causing panics for people.

I'll admit I haven't tested but it looks OK to me -- it seems to have
the required chunk in clip.c.
I'm not going to fight too hard for it (I'll let Michael champion it
if he really cares), but I think this is a legitimate -stable patch:
it fixes a panic that real users are seeing.
