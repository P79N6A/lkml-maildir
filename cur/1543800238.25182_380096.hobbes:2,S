Hi all,
Sorry for the intrusion, but i think i've stumbled across a bug in the 
linux kernel.
On an Asus KV8-S XE motherboard, the agpgart module is unable to 
properly determine the AGP aperture size, regardless of bios options 
(AGP 8x mode & AGP 4x mode), this *might* also be related to possible 
hangs in X11 when using DRI.
Bug was seen on the following config:
Asus K8V-S XE motherboard, 512MB ram with AMD Sempron 3200 (Athlon64 core)
Witnessed with an ATI Radeon 9700 Pro card and with an Asus Radeon 9200 SE.
I'll try & test this config with some more gfx cards to see if the gfx 
card has any influence on the detection, but i'm not sure i have any 
nVidia cards available.
This phenomenon has been found in atleast the following kernel versions:
linux 2.6.12-r9
linux 2.6.14-r4
linux 2.6.14-r5
linux 2.6.14-r7
The reported aperture size is always 32M, more details can be provided, 
just ask what you need to know.
With kind regards,
Ochal Christophe
