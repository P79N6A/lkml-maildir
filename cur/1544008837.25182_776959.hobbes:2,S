Again the file systems handle failing barriers and they expect it.

No there is nothing unordered. The file system path typically looks like
commit of a transaction
	if (i have never seen a barrier failing) 
		write block with barrier
		if (EOPNOTSUPP) {
			record failure
			submit synchronously
		}
	} else
		submit synchronously
So if a pvmove barrier fails it will just submit synchronously.
The write block with barrier bit varies, jbd/gfs2 do it synchronously
too and xfs does it asynchronously (with io done callbacks), but
in both cases they handle an EOPNOTSUPP comming out in the final
io done.
When the pvmove migrates from no barrier support to barrier support
there won't be any barrier on the file system for the time of the
current mount, but that's also fine.
