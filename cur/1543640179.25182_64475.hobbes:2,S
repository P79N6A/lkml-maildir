Yes. If you'll look at d1510r0c.pdf from ATA guys, you'll find that
between 0b and 0c revisions definition of EOT bit (highest bit of
length) was removed. It is very unfortunate because of now host
adapters cannot prefetch across segment boundaries, because of host
adapter does not know when transfer will terminate (unless host monitors
all accesses to the disk and maintains its own set of IDE registers 
(including HOB, so using > 256sectors transfers with such host adapters
which do not implement HOB is impossible)). It is also very dangerous 
because of for reads when drive generates more data than expected, with 
EOT flag transfer was terminated with error, but without EOT host will 
just fetch random entries after last valid, and will (silently) corrupt 
random memory. 
And Promise implements old, safe&prefetchable, interface, while Intel
just fetches more and more PRD entries as long as drive has/wants more 
data.
