John Cherry from OSDL has something like you propose.
It build each night + for each release.
Only releases are followed with extensive documentation (log's).
Go via 
http://www.osdl.org
 | Lab Activities | Linux kernel stability
to find it.
There is also links to other similar efforts for other architectures.
