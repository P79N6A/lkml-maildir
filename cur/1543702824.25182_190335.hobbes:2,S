tere are devices such as this that I admit to not knowing of until now...

Perhaps I should make an amendment. you could perhaps put a geiger counter 
and cobalt or other radioactive source into a key fob... but i don't 
think it would ever be considered 'safe' to carry.
other sources may be available as well (i admit to not getting the time to 
read the website until just now). doesn't look like it fits in a USB 
key-fob yet tho.
