I didn't say the assist hardware wouldn't need an extra driver.  Its not 
100% free, as Jeff proposes, but the CPU portion of these designs is 
_sufficient_ to run linux, and a driver can be written to drive the 
remainder of these chips.  Its the combination that network device 
manufacturers design to today: A specialized chip to do L3/L2 forwarding 
at line rate over a large number of ports, and just enough general 
purpose CPU to manage the user interface, the forwarding hardware and 
any overflow forwarding that the forwarding hardware can't deal with 
quickly.

To handle port densities that are competing in the market today?  Yes, 
which as I mentioned earlier would price designs like this out of the 
market.  Jeffs idea is a nice one, but it doesn't really fit well with 
the hardware that networking equipment manufacturers are building today. 
  Take a look at Broadcoms StrataSwitch/StrataXGS lines, or Switchcores 
Xpeedium processors.  These are the sorts of things we have to work with 
.  They provide network stack offload in competitive port densities, but 
they aren't also general purpose processors.  They need a driver to 
massage their behavior into something more linux friendly.  If we could 
develop an infrastrucutre that made these chips easy to integrate into a 
  platform running linux, linux could quickly come to dominate a large 
portion of the network device space.
