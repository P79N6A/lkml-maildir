Depends on how paranoid you are - I find the
red hat kernels to be a safe, if boring choice.

Sounds like you would have done better to use
the vendor suppplied kernel in this case -

Many do, some don't.
Actual bug fixes get folded into the main tree,
but things like the e100 driver, the dell perc
raid drivers, the tux webserver, the linux
vertual server etc that are all in the red hat
kernel may never be in mainstream.
I would sure like to see tux in main kernel,
since it's superior to the khttpd that's part
of the mainline tree.
But things like the e100 driver I could live
without if eepro100 gets to the point where
it works just as well.
