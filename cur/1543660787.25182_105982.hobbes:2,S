Depends, i have seen hardlocks where you don't get an oops, the nmi 
watchdog will work if the kernel is still running but say stuck in a busy 
loop and without the timer interrupt firing. Sometimes upping the interval 
by using idle=poll does help me out. Otherwise your cpu or kernel is 
really in a bad state.
