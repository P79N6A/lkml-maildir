That's not even relevant, I already offer the same patch offline to people who
*really* only have a wrong checksum, AFTER we check the contents of their eeprom
for them.
We help everyone out, and if you merge this patch you will prevent users from
getting to us for support in the first place.
I realize that we should probably document the "bad eeprom checksum" case more
decently but I think merging this patch is a bad idea for the *user* in all cases.
You completely bypass the fact that e100 eeproms and e1000 eeproms are completely
different beasts as well, one can be practically empty in all cases (e100), the
other one every bit counts (most e1000's), which is an unfair representation and
falsely tells the user that he can just do this without any information or
disclaimer as to what he may expect afterwards.
