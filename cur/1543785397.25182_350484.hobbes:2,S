hello everyone,
I am trying to setup a windows xp machine as a vpn server that accepts 
multiple ipsec tunnels from other windows xp machines.
My restrictions are the following:
1- I need to set the vpn server on windows XP (not windows 2000 server, nor 
2003, nor ISA server, etc.)
2- I need to use tunnel mode ipsec
3- The vpn server should accept MULTIPLE vpn tunnels.
The first problem I faced is that windows xp does not support ipsec tunnel 
mode between 2 xp machines. It only supports transport mode which is not 
what I want.
To overcome this lack of IP tunneling I tried to use the built-in tunneling 
capabilities such as PPTP and L2TP/ipsec, and it worked. But the problem 
here is that a windows xp can not accept more than ONE SINGLE incoming 
connection at a time, and I need multiple connections.
I think the solution could be one of the following:
1-Installing a third party FREE vpn server (or L2TP server) on windows XP. 
If you know one please tell me.
2-Importing some features from windows 2000 server or 2003 server (some 
executables or services or plugins that enable xp to run as a vpn server and 
accept multiple connections). If you know what to import please tell me.
3- Installing a pure IP tunneling solution on windows xp so that it can be 
combined with ipsec encryption to yield tunnel mode encryption.
I appreciate any help,
Alaadin
