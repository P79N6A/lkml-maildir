Subject: proper way to annotate kernel use of sys_xxx?

What is the correct way to annotate kernel code that calls a sys_xxx
function that expects a __user pointer as an argument?
To give a concrete example, sparse (among lots of other warnings for
do_mounts.c) says:
	init/do_mounts.c:69:16: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address spaces)
	init/do_mounts.c:69:16:    expected char const [noderef] *filename<asn:1>
	init/do_mounts.c:69:16:    got char [addressable] *<noident>
The code in question is the following:
	char path[64];
	/* ... */
	sprintf(path, "/sys/block/%s/dev", name);
	fd = sys_open(path, 0, 0);                 /* LINE 69 */
This is an abuse of sys_open(), but we know it's OK.  Is the right way
to shut up sparse to just change it to:
	fd = sys_open((const char __user *) path, 0, 0);
Thanks,
  Roland
