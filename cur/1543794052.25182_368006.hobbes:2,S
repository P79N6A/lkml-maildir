Working on adding support for cache-coherent operation to ARM and 
wondering exactly what this API is supposed to do. From the name it
is obviously supposed to tell the caller (only one in the kernel...
drivers/scsi/53c700.c) whether the provided dma_handle is cache-coherent
or not.  In the case of multiple DMA domains where certain devices
are on snooping interfaces and others are not we really want to know what
device the DMA address is on so can we add a struct device* ptr to this 
function? Or can we just kill it since nobody is actually using it? 
Calling dma_alloc_coherent should always return coherent/consistent 
(why the different naming conventions too?) so I don't really see a real 
use case.
