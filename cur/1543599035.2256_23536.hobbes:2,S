I think that red hat means: 
	recoomended swap (machine) = min (128M, 2 * RAM(machine));
My personal recommendation is: 
	recoomended swap (machine) = 2 * RAM(machine);
           (unless you know what you're doing). 
I run three machines with 0Mb swap: I know what I'm doing. If you know
you're going to run VERY VERY large simulations which have sort of
linear memory access patterns, it may pay to have LOTS more swap than
normally recommended.
Also, You spend just a few percent on "recommended swap" in relation
to what you just spent on "RAM (machine)". So even if you're never
going to use it, it's still usefull.
