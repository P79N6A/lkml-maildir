lets "make xconfig" on a freshly untarred kernel-tree.
look at the floppy disk icon of the qt application, that has just started:
Its in a normal, active state.
Mouse click on it:
.config is being saved.
Now in the current -mm head version, you'll notice something new:
after the mouse click on the floppy disk icon, the icon is greyed out.
If you mouse click on it now, nothing happens, which is ok IMHO,
as nothing has changed.
If you change some CONFIG_*, the floppy disk icon returns to "active state",
that is, if you mouse click it now, .config is written.
The "icon greying out" aka "save widget de/activation" is done by this
patch series.
Its done for the save-icons and the file-save menu entries of the
applications launched after "make xconfig" or "make gconfig" is called.
Purpose is: 
"let the (gtk/qt kernel configuration) application show me if there are
 unsaved changes to the .config,
 so there's 1 thing less I might wonder about"
more?
