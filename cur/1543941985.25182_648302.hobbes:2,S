Why would you want authorization? If you don't use IP (just ethernet 
framing), then 99% of the time the solution is to just trust the subnet. 
So most people would never want TLS/SSL, and the ones that *do* want it 
would probably also want IP routing, so you'd actually be better off with 
a separate higher-level bridging protocol rather than have TLS/SSL as part 
of the actual packet protocol.
So don't add complexity. The beauty of ATA-over-ethernet is exactly that 
it's simple and straightforward.
(Simple and straightforward is also nice for actually creating devices 
that are the targets of this. I just *bet* that an iSCSI target device 
probably needs two orders of magnitude more CPU power than a simple AoE 
thing that can probably be done in an FPGA with no real software at all).
Whatever. We have now officially gotten totally off topic ;)
