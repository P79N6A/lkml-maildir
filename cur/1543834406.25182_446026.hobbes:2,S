The defines of false and true to be themselves are going to cause a
thousand code readers to say "wtf?".  How about a comment, as in:
 enum {
 	false	= 0,
 	true	= 1
 };
+
+/* Let any other #if[n]def's on false/true presume they're defined */
 #define false false
 #define true true 
 
===
On second thought, I just grep'd the entire kernel with:
	grep -E '#ifn*def.*(false|true)'
and only found exactly one other such #ifdef construct:
  drivers/media/video/cpia2/cpia2.h:
    #ifndef true
    #define true 1
    #define false 0
    #endif
Perhaps we should just drop the cpia2.h defines, and drop
the defines of false/true to be themselves.  And drop my
comment ;).
