My RTL8139 (Identified 8139 chip type 'RTL-8139A')
was fine in 2.4.3 and doesnt work in 2.4.5.
Copying the 2.4.3 version of 8139too.c makes things work again.
Since lots of people complained about this, I have not tried to
debug - maybe a fixed version already exists?
One remark:
2.4.5 says "eth1: media is unconnected, link down, or incompatible connection"
coming from 8139too.c line 1367. The code there is
	if (mii_reg5) {
		printk(KERN_INFO"%s: Setting %s%s-duplex based on"
			" auto-negotiated partner ability %4.4x.\n", dev->name,
			mii_reg5 == 0 ? "" :
			(mii_reg5 & 0x0180) ? "100mbps " : "10mbps ",
			tp->full_duplex ? "full" : "half", mii_reg5);
	} else {
		printk(KERN_INFO"%s: media is unconnected, link down, "
			"or incompatible connection\n",
			dev->name);
	}
where mii_reg5 is tested against zero inside a conditional
where we know that it is nonzero.
Probably the outer test is wrong.
