You mean generalize the struct for possible re-use by other audit
helpers but keep the type value and function distinct?
audit_aux_data_path?  Analogous to struct path in namei.c.

Could be an issue for syscalls that involve multiple files, e.g. rename.
We are at least still logging the last component name, device, and inode
number with the avc message, and only deferring logging of the full
pathname.
