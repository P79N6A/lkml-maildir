Sorry, but your patch is just incomplete and in some cases just wrong.
On my new ThinkPad, 3 of 12 devices would not work with your patch, so this
is far from "most common" and not acceptable. So eighter we get a fully
working modalias or we better stay without one for PNP and handle that
with the custom script we already use today.
