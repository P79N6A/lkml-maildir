May I congratulate you on your so-obvious twisting of what I said.
Can I also repeat that I was unable to get EITHER script to fail on
ANY of the kernels at my disposal. For reference, I tried 2.0.36,
2.0.37, 2.2.2, 2.2.5, 2.2.9 and 2.2.10 (all raw), and BOTH scripts
worked perfectly under ALL kernels. Various RedHat 5.1, 5.2 and 6.0
systems...
I therefore REPEAT my statement as quoted above: The report looks like
a faulty test command to me, rather than any fault in either bash or
the kernel...

True, but does that explain why the original script didn't fail
either? You could try applying a bit of common sense before posting
rubbish like this...

WHat sort of relationship is that supposed to bear to the subject
under discussion?

Precicely my point...
Best wishes from Riley.
