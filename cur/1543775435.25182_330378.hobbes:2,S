Subject: 2.6.13-rc1 CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK is useless on SMP

2.6.13-rc1 built with SMP=Y and DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y.  That uses
kernel/spinlock.c instead of the inline definitions of the spinlock
functions.  Alas only the inline definitions test for DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y,
none of the code in in spinlock.c has any debug facilities.
