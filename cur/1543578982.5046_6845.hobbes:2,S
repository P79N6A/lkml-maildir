Yeah, I reallized it would violate at least POSIX.  The discussion was
just bandying about ways to avoid an expensive 'open()' without breaking
lots of utilities and glibc stuff.  This might be something that could
be configured for specific server environments, where performance is
more imporant than POSIX/Unix98, but you still don't want to completely
break the system.  Just a thought, brain-damaged as it might be. ;-)
