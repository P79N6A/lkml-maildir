Here's a candidate. I did have it on. Yes, I know it causes a slowdown -
that was for testing. I could try to double check, if disabling that
single option fixes the problem - but for that I'd need to recompile and
re-install kernel and modules... I also didn't have
CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW switched on - but I don't think that could be
the reason.
