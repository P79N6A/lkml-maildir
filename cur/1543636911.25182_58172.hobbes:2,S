Quite nice. It's a more organised version of what I had, but as the
number of reports gets higher and higher, it could end up being as much a
maintainence nightmare as the log I was updating.
Talking with a few folks about this problem at the summit, a few times
jitterbug was mentioned. My faded memory doesn't recall too much about
those days, but ultimatly it didn't work out.
I'm wondering how such a system would work out today.
There's even possibilites for neat things like checking
bitkeeper to automatically update status when Linus applies
a patch, which before required interaction from Linus.
