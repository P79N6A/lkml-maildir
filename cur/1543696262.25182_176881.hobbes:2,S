Because your mozilla and evolution got swapped out overnight in favor of
cache touched by updatedb?  Then, when you get in in the morning, your
mozilla and evolution take forever to swap in, which is very annoying. 
Frankly, I don't care at all if the updatedb takes slightly longer due
to less cache space, as long as my evolution and mozilla are not swapped
out.  This is why I don't have any swap on my desktop.  Responsiveness
of the desktop is much more important to me than any speed-up of
cron-based cache-limited processes.
A possibly better solution to this, in my opinion, would be a way to
mark a working set, which get's swapped in as soon as there's space (ie
as soon as cache get's older than some amount of time).  This would
allow mozilla to be swapped out in favor of cache during the night, and
then swapped back in automatically when that cache ages out.  Obviously
this would need to be disabled on multiuser systems, but would help, I
believe, on desktops.  Then again, I have no time or skill to code it,
so feel free to ignore me completely. :)  The "no swap" solution works
great for me.
