ksymoops is still useful even when CONFIG_KALLSYMS is on.  ksymoops
decodes the Code: line, kallsyms does not.  Also kallsyms only handles
code addresses[*], ksymoops handles all symbols.
[*] Rusty's definition of "all symbols" does not not match mine.
    kallsyms in 2.6 should really be "ksomesyms".
