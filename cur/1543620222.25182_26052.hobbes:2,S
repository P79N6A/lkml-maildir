Amidst all the prune_dcache and other kswapd oopses reported
(which I'd love to solve, but still can't work out), there have
been a couple in shrink_cache itself, where the page from the
inactive_list is not marked as on LRU, or is marked as Active;
and also I think a couple in rmqueue, where the free page is
found to be on LRU.
Some of those may have been memtest86ed out of contention since,
and some may have been on SMP and so not candidates; but it did
just occur to me that we'd like to be sure nothing is messing
with the LRU at interrupt time, hence the patch.  Which of
course solves nothing, but might shed some light.
Sorry for being mysterious!
Hugh
