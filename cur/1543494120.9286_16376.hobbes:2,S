Interesting, I just came cross the same problem. I actually reported it
yesterday on this list. I haven't heard any comments about the proposed 
fix.

Well, I was not that careful with 2.2. I just quickly looked whether the
exact same error was being made, and it wasn't.

According to man page, times should return number of clock ticks that have
elapsed since the system has been up, so I think that's not correct.
I have not experienced that problem with times - clock() on the other hand
does just that. (Are you using glibc or libc5?) The problem with clock() 
is/was that kernel passes the (unsigned long) jiffies to glibc clock() as
it is, but glibc expects a signed int (time_t). If the values glibc gets
from the kernel, glibc intrepets that as an error and returns -1. Kernel
even uses some negative error codes when it can't allocate memory. This
has been fixed in the CVS glibc according to the glibc maintainers I was
in touch with. (Glibc doesn't return error in any case, even if kernel
returned an error code (-501...-1). OTOH, kernel can return -501...-1
also, when jiffies is in that range.)

Same here. I'm not sure about zsh-3.0.5, but I did investigate 3.1.5.   
There the problem lied in Zle/zle_main.c. The zsh team has already fixed
this:

Thanks, this is the diff for 3.1.5-pws-16 (Bart's already put something
into 3.0.6).

I proposed yesterday the following:
=================================================================
If the timeout is reached during do_select, current->timeout becomes zero.
The line
        if ((long) timeout < 0)
                timeout = 0;
is propably for that. However, if jiffies > 2**31, that won't work (since
timeout wraps around and actually becomes positive), and select returns
false values. I would suggest something like
        timeout = current->timeout ? current->timeout - jiffies - 1 : 0;
instead of
        timeout = current->timeout - jiffies - 1;
=================================================================
But I have no clue whether Alan Cox is planning to include the fix in
2.0.37.
