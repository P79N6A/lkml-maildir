Subject: kernel 2.2 against 2.4 on old dual-pentium system with intel hx-chipset

hello,
i have a big problem with my old dual-pentium-systems with intel hx-chipset 
(gigabyte and asus mainboards).
if i use kernel 2.2, it works fine. with kernel 2.4 i must deactivate smp and i can only 
use one cpu. if i try to use both cpu's, the system hangs after some ours or after 
some times of heavy system-load.
i try some parameters (noacpi noapic) without success.
can you help me, to get the newer kernel running on this systems ?
with newer p3-systems and intel bx-chipset i can use the kernel 2.4.x, but on the old 
systems, only kernel 2.2 works fine.
thank you for your help and goodby
