Well, 
Hardcoding  of block size to 512 bytes for disk devices is what currently 
either the block device driver or the sd driver is doing. Because, if
I run dd to the same device using the corresponding block device (sde)
it runs fine. So, I feel that either the sg driver or the block device
driver
or sd driver needs to be fixed. 
One more thing is that, sg driver can find out from READ_CAPACITY the
current
block size on the device. So, if dd specifies bs=4096 and count=1, then
accordingly, the sg driver should set the count to 8 and bs to the bs of
the device. IMHO, untimately, the total transfer length is what matters.
