Udev does not care about $MODALIAS at all about the string, it just
runs configured programs when a device is added. It's unlikely,
that we will ever need/have a built-in MODALIAS handling in udev.
Distros handle that all differently, most just do "modprobe $MODALIAS"
with the device event.

Well, the modalias match strings are native part of the kernel modules, so
it is just convenient to have the kernel to create the modalias to match
against these strings too. Userspace and modprobe usually doesn't care about
the actual content of the strings, as both come from the kernel and just need
to match each other. In theory, there is no need to keep userspace updated,
if a new bus is added, or the format is changed, which is nice.

What "policy"? We only need a way to export the multiple matches in a
sane way and using a multiline value is not really nice, especially when
added to the environment.
