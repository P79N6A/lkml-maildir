But while this is still a likely probability, the chances are no 
distribution is going to ship with CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND enabled. Breaking 
people's hardware (even if, at a fundamental level, it's the hardware 
that's broken) generally irritates users - and I suspect that the users 
it'll irritate the most are the ones who won't report it to LKML.
