Missing functionality:
1) "make M=/path/to/dir modules_install" does not run depmod. Pulling
   correct depmod info from kernel Makefile needs ugly hacks.
2) Try building external module A that exports some function, and then build
   another external module B (separate package, only knows function
   prototype) that uses said exported function. And I mean build it cleanly
   without puking error messages on me. 2.4 and older kernel got that right,
   but 2.6 is still FUBAR. Serious regression here.
Both above cases can be (and need to be) worked around using ugly hacks.
Sam,
Please understand that loop-AES needs to work with 2.0, 2.2, 2.4 and 2.6
kernels. Not just latest mainline, but all of them, including ones that you
cannot retroactively change.
