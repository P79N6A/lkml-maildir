Hi Albert.

Just curiosity, but how well is the particular set of AT commands
supported by this code documented? I've seen so many variations on the
so-called "Standard AT Command Set" that I always want to see them
documented first.
Also, how easy would it be to separate the AT handling code from the
ISDN modem emulation code so it could be used with more than one
underlying device?
Best wishes from Riley.
