Linus,
how about systems where there is no choice to have a /proc Filesystem?
I can always hear the cries of Ulrich for having some way to get some
constants from the kernel for glibc . The answer is always "use
/proc". But e.g. I use chrooted() webservers for my customer
CGI-Scripts, and I simply don't want to mount /proc in every single
chroot() just to get some constants in the glibc right.
Why not using sysctl (or call it something else) for _READ ONLY_
access to these basic system constants (e.g. HZ) and the /proc
Filesystem to read/write them?

If you make sysctl a "proc-only-thing", I would still need a /proc
filesystem for my chroot-jailed glibc's, wouldn't I?
	Regards
