Hello Chris,
as always very nice work!
I have it now running fine on top of 2.4.21-pre3-jam3 (2.4.21-pre3aa1).
Some fiddling was necessary but went smooth after all.
My /home partition is mounted with -o data=ordered and the performance is 
great. Sorry, no real benchmarks, yet.
But some question stay open:
Where is 01-akpm-sync_fs-fix-2.diff and 01-iput-deadlock-fix.diff?
Isn't it needed anylonger 'cause you merged them and SuSE's ftp isn't updated 
yet? All files are the "old" one's from 15. January.
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/mason/patches/data-logging/2.4.21
What about patch-2.4.20.rfs.06.05-transaction-overflow-fix-0.diff?
Should I put it on top, too?
Thanks,
	Dieter
