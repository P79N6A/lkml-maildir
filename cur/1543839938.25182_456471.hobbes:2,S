Ok ..thanks for pointing me to it. I am testing it now and will post my
observations soon.
That said, I think this patch needs more work, especially in the area
of better timeslice management and SMP load-balance. If you have any
comments on its general design and the direction in which this is
proceeding, I would love to hear them.
Thanks for your feedback so far on this!
