Hi all,
i am using time function in my application.
When i call the try function in a loop of say 1 lac iterations then i
m facing strange behaviour.
What i am doing is that i am making a call twice to time function
inside every iteration and i compare the time of both the calls.
But sometimes the time obtained from recent call is 1 second less than
the previous call.
Has anybody observed such kind of problem??
