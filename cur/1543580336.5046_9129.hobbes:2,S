yes i used it often in my installations and no problem with that
since 2.0.x
2.2.x works good too
never tried with linux 2.4.x
driver is supported by digiboard itself   and by linux
you have the choice of 2 drivers for these boards....
i used for my part the PC/8e  PC/16e and PC/32e   In ISA versions
and never had any problems... (except figuring out how to install for the
first time)
but it is very simple if you know how to read install instructions
