Esben, you are right. This is not about RT so it does _not_ belong in this
thread.  Please keep the topic in this thread about -mm.  We already have
a RT thread to discuss this in.
My comments here where about a fact that setscheduler when from interrupt
context friendly to interrupt context unfriendly and I thought it would
be good to document that fact.  I like Andrews answer better.  Document it
with a BUG_ON(in_interrupt).
