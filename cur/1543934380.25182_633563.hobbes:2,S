Somehow the nr_pages field is truncated to 16 bit and it 
seems that there are sign issues there? We are wrapping around....

An int is just a 16 bit field on i386? I thought it was 32 bits? Or is 
the result due to the way that systemtap works?
Could you post the neighboring per cpu variables to quicklist (look at the 
System.map). Maybe somehow we corrupt the nr_pages and page contents.
Also could you do another systemtap and also print out the current 
processor? Maybe nr_pages gets only corrupted on a specific processor. I 
see a zero there and sometimes other sane values.
