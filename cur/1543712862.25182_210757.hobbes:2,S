Clearly they can be replaced with inline code, as for catching the ill-op
fault and emulating inline, I want to think about that a bit on SMP, in
the case where multiple CPUs are accessing different locations, one is in
kernel and one in user mode, etc.
If it can be emulated safely in all cases, then that provides an out for
the 386 case. To be useful it would have to be correct for all
combinations of SMP, preempt and an interrupt and any point.
