Yikes indeed.  What's a distribution?  Oh, wait, I recall sometime back in
the last century I downloaded some diskette images called "Slackware 1.2".
I guess that's my distribution.  Since then I've replaced every single bit
outside of a few /etc/rc.d scripts, installed a dozen locally-built kernel
upgrades, etc.
Now that I think of it, what's a normal user?
