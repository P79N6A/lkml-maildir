It's less code in kernel now and in the future, more flexible (we have 
more options for compression and encryption in userspace), and less 
invasive. Specific points that make Suspend2 less attractive: it's a lot 
of code (500KB patch!), new compression code in kernel (LZF), dynamic page 
flags, and the special userspace notification mechanism 
(kernel/power/ui.c).
That being said, the biggest advantage for Suspend2 of course is that it's 
ready and stable now.
