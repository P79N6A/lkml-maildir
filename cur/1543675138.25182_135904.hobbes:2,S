This is nuts.  WimMark keeps on showing 2:1 swings in throughput when no
other test shows any variation at all.  I simply do not know what to make
of it.
Your results would appear to indicate that the regression between
2.5.69-mm5 and 2.5.69-mm8 was actually due to something in Linus's tree,
and it is now in 2.5.70.
I have an interdiff here between the linus.patch from mm5 and mm8 and it
contains nothing very interesting.
It's at 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/wimmark-interdiff.txt
The actual diff is at
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/wimmark-interdiff.patch.gz
There is the bio split stuff in ll_rw_blk.c, but that shouldn't matter.
Which device driver are you using?
