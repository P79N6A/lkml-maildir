of course I was thinking mostly at the unlink procedure, I see the point
now in having the information that no dentry exists on disk with such
name.  that's an heuristic to optimize some common case but the unlink
and a create failure should definitely get rid of the negative dentry,
it's not a common case to delete a file and then to try to access it,
while there are common cases that wants to avoid stale dentries around
for deleted files.
