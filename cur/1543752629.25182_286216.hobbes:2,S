My T2 (www.t2-project.org) PowerPC systems tend to be rock solid - I 
only once managed to get random memory corruption when I tried out 
PREEMPTION. BenH mentioned PREEMPTION and ReiserFS (I use) might not 
play that well - at least not on PowerPC.
I had yet no time to review the affected code myself - however without 
PREEMPTION all is well.
Yours,
