Immediate comments as follows:
(Krzysztof has already seen them in a private email but I'm putting  
them out so people can publically disagree with me if I have got this  
wrong.)
Code placement:
Queue Manager & NPE code => arch/arm/mach-ixp4xx
WAN driver code => drivers/net/wan
Eth code => drivers/net/arm
Kconfig:
I'm not convinced about 'config IXP4XX_NETDEVICES'. I'd lose it  
together with the drivers/net/ixp4xx directory
Ethernet & HSS code should probably select NPE and QMGR (rather than  
depend) but these options should still be exposed in arch/arm/mach- 
ixp4xx/Kconfig
