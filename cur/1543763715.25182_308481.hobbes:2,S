The machine is a quad xeon with P III 733 processors. I don't have profile
information available as I wasn't collecting as I went along. However,
backing out the patch made little difference
However, I reran the test on 2.6.11 and this time the performance
difference was a lot less. Something else must have been happening when I
collected the first set of poor results. I'll revisit this when I'm next
working on kernel stuff and see can I reproduce it again reliably.
