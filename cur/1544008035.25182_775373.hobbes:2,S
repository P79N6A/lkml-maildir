Yes, good idea, GFP_ATOMIC isn't always needed.

This was also raised in the past by Ingo and it's on my to-do list to
fix. Basically, if an allocation for internal kmemleak structures fails,
kmemleak should print a warning and disable the tracing since further
leak reports are irrelevant. Once I add the run-time kmemleak
configuration/disabling, I'll change the BUG_ON and panic calls to
something less severe.
