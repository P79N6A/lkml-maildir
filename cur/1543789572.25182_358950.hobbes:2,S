the problem is that there are many sources of read-only pages (how many 
shared library pages are not read-only for example) and not all of them 
are of equal value to the system
the ideal situation would probably be something like the adaptive 
read-ahead approach where the system balances the saved pages between 
processes/files rather then just benifiting the process that uses pages 
the fastest.
I don't have any idea how to implement this sanely without a horrible 
performance hit due to recordkeeping, but someone else may have a better 
idea.
thinking out loud here, how bad would it be to split the LRU list based on 
the number of things that have a page mapped? even if it only split it 
into a small number of lists (say even just 0, 1+) and then evicted pages 
from the 0 list in prefrence to the 1+ list (or at least add a fixed value 
to the age of the 0 pages to have them age faster). this would limit how 
badly library and code pages get evicted by a large file access.
