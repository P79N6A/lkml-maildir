I've installed FC2 and am experiencing problems with usb devices and
ethernet cards (it might be everything on the pci bus).  I don't have
this problem with their UP kernel, but I do have it with their SMP
kernel.
I decided to build a 2.6.6 using the FC2 i686-smp config to see if that
would help, but I have the same problems.
I notice that right after uncompressing the smp kernel, there's a
message that says (paraphrasing from memory)
  ACPI: S3 and PAE don't play nicely together.  Disabling S3.
I didn't see this message when I booted the UP kernel.
The system is a Tyan Tiger 230T (S2507T) with dual 800MHz PIIIs.  This
board has a Via Apollo Pro133T chipset, a VT82C694T north bridge, and a
VT82CC686B south bridge.  lspci output is below.
I have 2 nics installed (e100 and 8139too).  Both have the right modules
loaded and are configured properly (including routes), but I can't ping
out of the system nor do anything else over the network other than
pinging the nics themselves.
My usb hosts are detected, but nothing attached works.  My usb optical
mouse doesn't even light up.
All of these problems go away in UP mode.
Any suggestions?
Here's the output of lspci:
