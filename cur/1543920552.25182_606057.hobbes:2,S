Gabriel, could you please post a disassembled code for pick_next_task_fair()?
(objdump -d kernel/sched.o and then search for pick_next_task_fair --
copy_and_past)
anyway, my guess is that it's :
                se = pick_next_entity(cfs_rq);
                cfs_rq = group_cfs_rq(se);
'se' _happens_ to be NULL and group_cf_rq(se) does se->my_q and
(according to my calculations) offset(my_q) == 68 (0x44) for x86 32bit
system with CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS=n and CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED=y
(according to the config).
that might take place provided put_prev_task_fair() failed for some
reason to insert 'current' (or its corresponding group element) back
into the tree in schedule()... say, due to some inconsistency in
cfs_rq's data.
Srivatsa, that's somewhat similar to another issue that has been
posted earlier today (crash in put_prev_task_fair() -->
__enqueue_task() --> rb_insert_color()) that you are already aware of
...  (/me will continue tomorrow).
