I don't have preempt enabled, so I thought that this patch wasn't
concerning me, but I tried it anyway. Result is a definite regression.
standby/S1 or mem/S3 make the kernel oops and hangs. Call strace:
	enter_state
	suspend_prepare
	enter_state
	state_store
	subsys_attr_store
	fill_write_buffer
	sysfs_write_file
	vfs_write
	sys_write
	sysenter_past_esp
or
	acpi_system_write_sleep
	acpi_system_write_sleep
	vfs_write
	sys_write
	sysenter_past_esp
(depending on whether I use /sys/power/state or /proc/acpi/sleep)
Before the patch, S1 and S3 would have the screen blink and computer
immediately resume to normal operation. Sometimes, S1 would actually
standby (screen lit and hard disk spinning, though) waiting for a
keypress.
disk/S4 don't suspend anymore. It starts very well, but the computer
immediately resume to normal operation:

Prior to the patch, the computer would suspend and bug at resume time.

Thank you for actually improving swsusp, despite what you said.
