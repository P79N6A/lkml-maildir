Interesting...  I take it then that -i just reads the information from the
drive firmware itself and -I gives what the kernel is actually using!?  I
note that -i returns exactly the manufacturer's specs as written on the
drive, even the suggested LBA c/h/s.  Why is it that -I returns the vendor
information in BE byte pairs?
