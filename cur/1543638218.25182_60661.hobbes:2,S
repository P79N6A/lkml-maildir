Since IDE 111 not any more...

We starve anyway, becouse the kernel isn't real time and we can't
guarantee "sleeping" for some maximum time and comming back.
We don't reschedule the kernel during this kind of "sleeping".
And we can't know that a command on the "mate" will not take 
extraordinary amounts of time. It's only a problem if mixing travan
tapes with disks on a channel.
