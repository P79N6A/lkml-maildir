Subject: New 2.2.0 sparc patch

We've fixed a few bugs, so I've made a new patch for people to play
with:
ftp.kernel.org:/pub/linux/kernel/davem/sparc-2.2.0-2.diff
In particular, the cgsix crashes when leaving/returning from/to X
should be fixed now on all systems, thanks to Eddie.
Enjoy.
We're trying to finish things out on Ultrapenguin-1.1.9, I don't like
to make predictions, but you might be able to expect something final
in about 1 month.
Don't worry, we'll be making several test releases and telling people
on the sparc lists.  We ask that everyone grabs a spare disk and tries
out an install on a company/university wide critical server near
you. :-)
Later,
David S. Miller
