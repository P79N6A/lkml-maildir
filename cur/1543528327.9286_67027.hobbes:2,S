Hello!
> It's softnet. 
Andrea, could you explain the sense of the problem in couple of words?
Alexey
PS1. If you need really low latency on SMP, you want to move it
     from global BH to tasklet. If these events are really frequent
     (sort of net_bh), it should be separate softirq.
PS2. If this is related to message "__elevator_merge: req ....", than
     it will not help, I see this message on UP machine.
