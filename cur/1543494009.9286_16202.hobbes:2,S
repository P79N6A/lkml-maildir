I found a bug that would case this in 2.0.36 and sent the fix to Alan.
However, it caused some worse problems on his platform (for reasons
that I didn't understand). The fix worked fine on my platform. 
Having said that, I just looked at my fix, and it was related to 
SYN_RECV problems....
I attach it (for what it is worth).
