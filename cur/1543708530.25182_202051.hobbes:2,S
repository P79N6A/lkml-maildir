Well, recovery is a garbage-in, garbage-out process - I
think you will need to repair that loopback file.

Your loopback file seems to have got corrupted, XFS reports
this as an internal error (generic error message).

XFS detected corruption, and tried to dump out some state info
at the point where it noticed the problem.

xfs_repair will tell you whats wrong, and should fix it.
