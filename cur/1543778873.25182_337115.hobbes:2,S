Please try to revert the attached? 
    [PATCH] file_storage and UHCI bugfixes
    The patch below (as547) corrects two minor errors, one in the
    file_storage gadget driver (need to send a length-zero packet if a
    control response is short) and one in the alternate UHCI driver (need
    to set the QH bit in the frame list). Both of these are back-ports of
    things that have been in 2.6 for several releases.
