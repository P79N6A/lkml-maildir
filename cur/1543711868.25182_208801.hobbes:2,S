Subject: 2.6.4 swsusp on 2 swap partitions?

i thought i had read that swsusp can now use more than one swap
partition, but my experience is proving otherwise.
when i suspend with 2 swap partitions enabled, it refuses to
resume complaining of a "wrong kernel version", then proceeds to
boot up from scratch.
i think it also may be trying to write suspend signatures on
both partitions because they're no longer usable as swap until i
mkswap them.
should i be able to suspend across 2 partitions?  i only
specify one of them in the resume= kernel parameter.
