Nope, access_ok is required for the first "space" bytes starting at
buf.  copy_to_user is only done for the strings which start "space"
bytes into buf.  The first "space" bytes of buf contain pairs of longs
which are set using __put_user, which does not check access.  The
separate check on the start of buf is for speed, one big check instead
of checking on each long that is stored.
