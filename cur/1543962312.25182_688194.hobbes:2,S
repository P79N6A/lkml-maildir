Hi there,
The code is correct if a bit subtle.  I have put a fix of it as part of 
a larger patch series at:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/hpa/linux-2.6-inttypes.git
Your patch is simpler, so if Linus doesn't take the patch series this 
window we should push your patch after the window closes.
