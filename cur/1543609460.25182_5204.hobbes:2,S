My company is a cheap group of people :D  They don't pay their support
staff(read: me!) even close to market rate, so I couldn't expect them to
go pay for something they think is free as in free beer.  I already have a
supervisor pushing to replace these machines with overpriced Compaq NT
servers. :/

I can do without it until 2.4.x becomes stable.  My only use of it is on
one or two machines with broken bios's that if i upgrade, should become
compliant with the large hard drive that is in there now.  I don't use the
Promise controllers yet, so that removes my other reason to use the ide
patches.  I can't rely on the ide patches actually, because of the HP
Colorado 7/14 and 10/20's in service, which break when the machine is
patched.

I see your point, and don't disagree with it, you've put a lot of work
into this.
Thank you for your work,
