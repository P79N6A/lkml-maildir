 That's not true for the I/O APIC.  That's only true for the local APIC.
 The I/O APIC may be wired to the PCI-ISA bridge, specifically the APICCS#
(chip select) line may be driven by that bridge when a PCI cycle targets
the area assigned to the I/O APIC.  This is certainly the case for
discrete implementations, like the i82371SB/AB (PCI-ISA bridge) + i82093AA
(I/O APIC) pair, possibly for others, including later I/O APICs integrated
into chipsets.  Obviously cycles from CPUs travel to the PCI-ISA bridge
across the associated PCI bus.
