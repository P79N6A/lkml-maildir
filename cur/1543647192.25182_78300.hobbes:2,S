A library can define global variables visible to others, has its own BSS:
int x;
void f()
{
}
built with gcc -shared, and nm'ed gives:
00000694 T f
000017f8 B x
000016f8 D y
from man nm:
  "B" The symbol is in the uninitialized data section (known as BSS).
  "D" The symbol is in the initialized data section.
  "T" The symbol is in the text (code) section.
Was about this or I misunderstood you ?
