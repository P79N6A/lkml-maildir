Do you vote against that? I'm not.
It does not have to be financed by the government - but it can.
And I think that already happens in smaller amounts in Germany.
The BSI (my translation: ministry for security in information technology)
already sponsors the project SPHINX for developing encrypted email
services (based on GNU gpg). This is only one example.
Why not? Computers are getting more and more important in our daily life.
It's obvious to protect common goods. Microsoft can still develop
their non disclosed products for "more security".
I thought moms and dads would still teach their children:
"If a stranger talks to you, offering chocolate and says: trust me -
run away and ask other for help"
Oh, is that too old fashioned?  ;-)
