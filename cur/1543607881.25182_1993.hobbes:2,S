Don't know about you, but I can't get to bootdisk.org's nameservers.  The
site isn't indexed by Google, either.
I tried bootdisk.com, but they have a distinctly w4r3z feel to them.  That
tends to turn me off.  Strictly speaking, you're not supposed to
distribute those images to people without a license...
