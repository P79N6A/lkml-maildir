Yes, agreed.  But many unlikely() macros are simply there because gcc isn't
smart enough yet:
eg. fs/read_write.c:
		if (unlikely(put_user(pos, offset)))
			return -EFAULT;
It'd be better to have gcc know that this function was unlikely to return
a -ve value, and derive all the error paths itself.
It'd also be nice to be able to mark eg. printk() and BUG() as fundamentally
unlikely.
Sometimes, unlikely()/likely() help code readability.  But generally it
should be considered the register keyword of the 2000's: if the case isn't
ABSOLUTELY CRYSTAL CLEAR, or doesn't show up on benchmarks, distain is
appropriate.
Cheers,
Rusty.
