Panic is confirmed.  This time, it lived long enough to log:
May  6 14:05:05 babylon5 kernel: Kernel panic: scsi_free:Bad offset
Since it involves the CDROM, the aha1542 driver is implicated.  Why it's
getting a bad offset, I don't understand enough about the SCSI drivers to
know; all the scsi_free calls in aha1542.c look identical to me.
Would any Linux SCSI gurus care to let me know any diagnostic procedures
recommended for nailing this one?
