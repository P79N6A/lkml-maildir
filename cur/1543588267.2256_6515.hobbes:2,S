I have run across a problem with 2.4.3 on my Dell lattitude CPx.  It boots
ok but when it gets to bringing up the pcmcia adapter it gets a spurious
interrupt from the pcmcia socket and then fials to init.  This is the last
problem (apart from NFS.lockd) that I am having.  
If anyone has any insight into this, I am not really up on pcmcia sockets,
etc...  I would appreciate it....
