Depends on the arch & other matters. 768Mb on PPC at least, and
it starting to be common within laptops as well.

At worst, that could be an arch provided routine. On most PPC32's
I can then just disable data translation on the MMU and access
all pages without kmap'ing them. But that's not terribly portable
and each arch would need different kind of hacking.
