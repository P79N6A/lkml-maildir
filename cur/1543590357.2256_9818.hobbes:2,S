 Yep, I know (ia64 and sparc*).  But being lazy enough (and being short on
time) I won't do it until I know the idea of the change is accepted.  I'm
sorry -- I sent previous versions of the patch twice since last Summer
with no response at all and doing bits no one is interested in is a waste
of time.
 Thanks for your response, though -- maybe there is someone interested,
after all.
