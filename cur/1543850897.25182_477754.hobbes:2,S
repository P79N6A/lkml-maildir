It may be a bit much to be calling all the way through up to the PCI
layer just to pluck out a simple integer, don't you think?  The PCI
bus pointer comparison is just a symptom of how silly this is.
Especially since this will be used for every packet allocation a
device makes.
So, please add some sanity to this situation and just put the node
into the generic struct device. :-)
