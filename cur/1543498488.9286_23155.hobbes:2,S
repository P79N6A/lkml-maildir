Would making the masq lists doubly-linked be too hideous to
contemplate? It would eliminate searching the list in
ip_masq_unhash(), and there's minimal impact on ip_masq_hash() if it
always inserts at the head of the list.

Unhash for masq_expire() doesn't need to be fast since nothing is
waiting for it to complete, but ip_masq_unhash() gets called from
a few places in packet processing as well, so making it faster would
be a good thing.
