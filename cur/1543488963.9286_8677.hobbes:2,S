I've just had someone bashing Linux because of the 4GB max physical limits
for Intel architectures. I've told him to fuck off and buy an 64bit Alpha,
but he mentioned that BSDI can use all 64GB on a Xeon's 36bit addressing
range. Why is Linux limited to 4GB and BSDI can address 64GB ona Xeon?
Cheers,
Alex
