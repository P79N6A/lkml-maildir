Thank you both for your help.
NeTraMet looks like it is the right solution, I'll recommend it if I'm
ever asked. 
In my particular case I hacked up a kernel patch before I received
these messages, which seems to be working well[1]. It's parallel to
the masquerading modules system in that a hook is provided for
accounting modules where, if they are registered, they get iphdr's at
the right point in the masquerading/demasquerading process. The
example module I wrote maintained a hash table and wrote stuff to
/proc. It seems to work, but given Mark's comments on the limited
constituency and on user-space solvability of the problem (which are
certainly true) and Michael's post on mature software which solves the
problem, I'll keep the patches to myself and suggest NeTraMet if I'm
ever asked.
  [1] It turned out that it was only 300 lines or so, mainly /proc
      handling.
Thanks again for listening,
Dan.
