Yes I did, it didn't crash after a couple hours. Of course it doesn't 
prove anything as the crash appears to be the result of a race.
I'll now apply Oleg's fix and see if things get better.

"My" test program forks 1000 children who sleep for 1 second then look for 
themselves in /proc, warn if they can't find themselves, and exit. So 
basically the idea is that the process list will shrink very rapidly at 
the same moment every child does readdir(/proc).
I attached the test program, I take no credit (nor shame) for it, it was 
provided to me by IBM (possibly on behalf of one of their own customers) 
as a way to demonstrate and reproduce the original readdir(/proc) race 
bug.
