I don't know if this is the lockup you're trying to address, but
2.6.18's bcm43xx has definitely regressed for me versus 2.6.17.x.
2.6.18 vanilla and 2.6.18 with your patch both lock my system hard
with bcm43xx. I've got an HP/Compaq nx6125 laptop. Symptoms are that
it will associate fine on its own and send traffic to/fro upon ifup,
but when I do an iwconfig, ifdown, ifup to change the access point,
the system locks (somewhat randomly) during one of those operations.
Well, the iwconfig or the ifup, actually.

I've got multiple access points in view of the laptop, a g (54Mb), and
a b (11Mb). Neither with encryption enabled, if that makes a
difference (we live in the boonies).
It's 2.6.18 + your patch, compiled for x86_64, ubuntu devel.
Any suggestions or requests for tests?
