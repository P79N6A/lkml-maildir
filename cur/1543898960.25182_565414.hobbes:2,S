Is there something I could do to help? It's been years since I programmed C, 
but I'm a former librarian, current configuration management tools 
consultant. I write good standards-compliant HTML and XHTML, and Perl is my 
life these days.
Point me at something where I won't be duplicating effort and I'll take a look 
at it.
