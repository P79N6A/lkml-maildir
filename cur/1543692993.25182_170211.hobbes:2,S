Suspend/resume migration of guest OSes is on the "todo" list. Its
not hard, but we haven't gotten around to it.
See below for my reply to Jacob Gorm Hansen as to what needs
doing. Jacob did the NomadBIOS work, which is cool stuff, and has
many similar issues to suspend/resume in Xen.
Cheers,

It's on our list of things to do, but haven't quiet got around to.
Our plan is to have the code that does the suspend/resume run in
domain 0 (the privileged domain), where it can memory map the
physical memory of other domains to read/write, and has easy
access to the disk/network etc.
The one complication with doing this on Xen is that since we
deliberately expose real resources, it's likely that the set of
physical 'machine' pages available to the domain when it is
resumed will be different from when it was suspended.
Hence, we need to re-write the OS's page tables to reflect the
change. This is actually quite straight forward since Xen already
needs to track which pages contain page directories/tables.
However, it's also necessary to update the OS's "mem_map"
structure (or equivalent) to reflect the new 'physical' to
'machine' page mapping.  This is obviously highly OS specific. We
could do this with a simple stub function in the OS, or we could
make the domain0 'resume' program OS specific. We haven't decided
which approach we prefer.  Having some some limited co-operation
from the guest OS in suspend/resume is quite sensible anyway, as
you need it to rerun DHCP etc anyway.
We'd probably modify the guest OS to cause it to evict the entire
buffer cache before asking for a suspend, to minimize the state.
Volunteers welcome ;-)
Cheers,
Ian
