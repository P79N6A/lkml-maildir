Yes, and with a bitmap configured on the raid1, you just resync the 
blocks that have been written while the connection was down.

Well, if people would like to see a timeout option, I actually coded up 
a patch a couple of years ago to do just that, but I never got it into 
mainline because you can do almost as well by doing a check at 
user-level (I basically ping the nbd connection periodically and if it 
fails, I kill -9 the nbd-client).

You can configure write_behind (aka, asynchronous writes) to buffer as 
much data as you have RAM to hold. At a certain point, presumably, you'd 
want to just break the mirror and take the hit of doing a resync once 
your network leg falls too far behind.
