That's good, but having an explict API for suspending threads is very useful,
since it can greatly simplify the already complicated signal handling in
highly threaded systems. It's something that your group should seriously
consider, since I expect some explicit thread suspension call to be implemented
in Posix threading standard, via their committee. Mainly, because of the
advent of heavily threaded language runtimes as standard programming staple.
It's a good thing to have regardless.

I'm running out of things to say. ;)
