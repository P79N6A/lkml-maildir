You can regularely pull Linus' tree (or the tree of the maintainer you 
sent your patch) and see whether your patches still apply cleanly. 
Whenever they cause a reject, they need your attention: either they were 
applied, or they got out of date because something else changed.
(akpm also sends out automatic notification emails for patches in the -mm 
tree based on a similar method.)

Well, you can send out a patch series:
  [patch 01/02] Prepare foo for blah
  [patch 02/02] Apply blah to foo
Ideally you would finish the patch description for patch 02 with something 
like
---
This patch depends on [patch 01/02] Prepare foo for blah
But usually people will assume they have to apply the patches in order 
even without you explicitly telling them.
Unless you are keen on particular feedback about patch 01 before doing 
much work on patch 02, this should work out well.
