Same for me, using pmdisk.
Only thing is that the shell used to issue the echo -n disk > /sys/power/state
gets killed for an unhadled page request.
Good bargain for a working suspend, though ;-)
For me it is actually a feature, since I use su to issue the suspend
command, on resume I get back my user (not sudoed) shell...
Thanks, bye.
