To create a TAGS file for emacs, which makes navigating the source
tree a lot easier.

On my system I get 0.40s with NO_MAKEFILE_GEN compared to 3.41s
without, so my system is fast enough even without NO_MAKEFILE_GEN. I
just find it strange that the documentation says bug reports will be
ignored. If it breaks unintentionally in future kernels, fixing it
would probably not be too hard. Or are you planning to remove this
feature altogether?
