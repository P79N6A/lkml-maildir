From Configure.help:
IP: kernel level autoconfiguration
CONFIG_IP_PNP
  This enables automatic configuration of IP addresses of devices and
  of the routing table during kernel boot, based on either information
  supplied on the kernel command line or by BOOTP or RARP protocols.
  You need to say Y only for diskless machines requiring network 
  access to boot (in which case you want to say Y to "Root file system
  on NFS" as well), because all other machines configure the network 
  in their startup scripts.
It works fine for 2.4.4. However, in 2.4.4-ac8, even if I select
CONFIG_IP_PNP, I have to pass ip=xxxx to kernel, in addition to
nfsroot=x.x.x.x:/foo/bar. With 2.4.4, I can just pass
nfsroot=x.x.x.x:/foo/bar to kernel.
