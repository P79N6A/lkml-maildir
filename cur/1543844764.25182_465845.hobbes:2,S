A recent 2.6.18 kernel upgrade on one of my machines broke usb audio.
I'm using a TerraTec Aureon 5.1 USB MKII to feed ac3 audio to a 
receiver, but after the upgrade, trying to play any audio (tried aplay, 
mplayer, xine, etc...using both oss and alsa audio) results in the 
kernel log being filled with the message:
"cannot submit datapipe for urb 5, error -28: not enough bandwidth"
Unfortunately the upgrade was from 2.6.14 (yes, it's old but the machine 
has no network connection usually) so there is quite a lot of 
differences to the snd-usb-audio driver in the meantime.
Unless someone has suggestions as to a simple fix, I guess I'll 
start testing kernels in the 2.6.14 <-> 2.6.18 range soon to try to pin 
down a certain changeset...
