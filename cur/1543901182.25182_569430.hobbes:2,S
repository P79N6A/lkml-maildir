I merged this into my net-2.6 tree, there was a tiny conflict
in crypto/Kconfig I had to resolve because of the async_tx
stuff that went in upstream.
Herbert can you contact the async_tx author to make sure that
his crypto/ bits go through you in the future so that conflicts
like this can be avoided?
Thanks.
