The only "true" restrictions, by your definition, are the laws of 
physics. A
"law" passed by Congress is simply a piece of paper that the citizens of
the US agree to follow (transitively, because we agree with Congress
because we agree with the Constitution).  Various other "laws" specify
what punishments we may or may not receive if we do not follow those
laws.  My example is no less a restriction than those others, except 
that
it has a lesser punishment associated with it.
Also from dictionary.com:

I would call "If you distribute you lose your $20 subscription" a
"limitation", and it most certainly restricts my ability to use the 
kernel to
the fullest extent that the GPL provides.

But if I paid $20 for one year of said support?

What _is_ inside the GPL's scope is that no contract may require me
to abstain from my GPL rights.  If I use my full GPL rights, then they
are telling me that I break the contract and lose my $20 support.

As I said, IANAL, but I do feel strongly about this issue (though I've
never paid for their software).  In any case, I think this point will be
moot if SveaSoft continues with their announced plan to require an
activation key.  That would _definitely_ be against the GPL.
