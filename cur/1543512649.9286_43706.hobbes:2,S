Clockwise is a real-time file system for Linux.  Clockwise schedules
data streams from and to disk by means of a non-preemptive EDF scheduler.
Best-effort file systems (e.g. EXT2 file systems) can co-exist on the
disks, and best-effort file systems are served as quickly as is possible 
without endangering real-time deadlines.
More information (and kernel module sources) can be found on:
