OK, interesting point, though this would apply only to interrupt latency,
not to scheduling latency or to latency for any other system services,
right?
Do you believe that the 50-us delay measured by Kristian and Karim was
due to APM or due to hardware (as Karim suspected)?  If the latter,
any guesses as to the cause of the holdup?  50 us is a -really- long
time for ~100 instructions on today's hardware, even if each instruction
misses the cache!
						Thanx, Paul
