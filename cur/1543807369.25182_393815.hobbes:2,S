Dearest HCH,
Please consider adhering to a quality control process.  No patch comes
out of Namesys without a second person testing it (that includes
compiling it).  Users should not be burdened with code that has not been
tested by a second person.  Everyone makes mistakes of this kind, the
difference is that some persons use a quality control process to avoid
burdening more than one other person with them.
