There are no overcommit failure modes.  These QoS parameters are for
constraining aggressive power management throttling from breaking things
thereby enabling better power management solutions.
The QoS values are system wide parameters, not per process or driver.
So the code takes the max or min depending on what class of parameter is
in question.  So if you have multiple applications asking for network
throughput of 400Mbs the current code will let the nic driver find out
that it shouldn't throttle itself to the point where it can provide
400Mbs to any one.
You raise a perspective I overlooked.  For each of the parameter classes
I had been thinking of computing some extrema out of the set of
requests.  However; for throughput it may make more sense to sum up a
collative value.
I'm not sure which way would make more sense.
