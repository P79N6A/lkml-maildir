Subject: [PATCH 2/3] lumpy: back out removal of active check in isolate_lru_pages
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/12/292

As pointed out by Christop Lameter it should not be possible for a
page to change its active/inactive state without taking the lru_lock.
Reinstate this safety net.
