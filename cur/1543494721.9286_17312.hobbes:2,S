Hmm.. It only used to take my 486dx2-66 30-40 minutes max, but that was for
1.2/2.0. I don't think 2.2 is _that_ much bigger. You not compiling from

Hmm.. It depends what it's used for; it might not be such a bad idea to reboot
if you can spare the downtime.

"How much will that be?" asks the neutron.
"For you?" replies the bartender, "no charge"
