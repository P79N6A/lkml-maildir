	Hi,
	You probably saw this one comming from multiple source. If
not, there it is.
	Greg : next time, please try to compile. I don't ask any
testing, because I know you can't do that, but there is little excuses
for compilation errors. Yeah, it may add a few seconds to your kernel
compile time.
	Jean
