Hi,
  I have posted a couple of times in the past to no avail... I have an
Intel 31244 SATA controller that is supposed to work with the sata_vsc
driver module... It does in fact, almost....
  You can insert the module in a running kernel and after barking as
follows (once for each disk attached) it runs just fine.

Jan 24 13:55:37 linux kernel: Disabling IRQ #3
  The problem is that when you insert the module at boot time, the machine
just hangs while trying to enumerate the first disk.... Same when booting
with the module builtin to a monolithic kernel....
  To facilitate helping me, I have gathered the requisite stuff and posted
it on my website as follows:
   
http://www.dpsims.com/~dpsims/31244/
  If someone would be so kind as to help me, I would be willing to provide
access to the machine in question for testing, etc... I believe the
problem is caused by the Intel 31244 having multiple ways of sending
interrupts... The Intel documentation is located at:
   
http://www.dpsims.com/~dpsims/31244/31244_developers_guide.pdf
and I draw your attention to section 5.8 and 5.9.... The code for the
sata_vsc.c from kernel 2.6.10 can be found at
   
http://www.dpsims.com/~dpsims/31244/sata_vsc.c
I would make this work myself if I had the required skill sets... but I
don't.... Thus I am reduced to pleading ;)
Please help me. I will try to contribute whatever I can... quickly
test.... /etc...
Dave
