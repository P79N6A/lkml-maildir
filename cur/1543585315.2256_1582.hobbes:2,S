If memory serves me correctly, this disk is the same model as
one I send back for RMA... I think your disk is toast.
you could try using badblocks to scan it, prefferably in read-write
mode (you'll have to move your data to another disk first, of course,
since this erases data)  You could try just a read scan first.
The clicking is likely the drive trying to re-read the bad sectors.
You should try to exchange it under warranty, before your data
disappears.
You could try using an Ultra-DMA 66 cable to improve signal quality,
even though this chipset (I think) only supports UDMA33.  Also,
try it with the drive by itsself (not sharing cable with a cdrom or
another disk) on an interface.
