Could you do the following during an mp3 skipping test please:
vmstat 1 | tee -a vmstat.log
n=1; while true; do /usr/sbin/readprofile -n -m /boot/System.map-`uname -r` | sort -k 2,2 > profile.log.$n ; n=$(($n + 1)) ; sleep 1 ; done
If you could stop both the vmstat and the readprofile loop shortly
after the skip (not _too_ shortly, at least 1 second after it) I'd be
much obliged.
