I've encountered the same problem in a config-generation script a while
ago. Fortunately, bash provides enough ways to remove most of the forks,
but the result is less portable.
I've downloaded your code, but it does not compile here because of the
tv_nsec fields in struct stat (2.4, glibc 2.2), so I cannot use it to
get the most up to date version to take a look at the script. Basically,
all the 'cut' and 'sed' can be removed, as well as the 'dirname'. You
can also call mkdir only if the dirs don't exist. I really think you
should end up with only one fork in the loop to call 'diff'.

It is very common to cut times by a factor of 10 or more when replacing
common unix tools by pure shell. Dynamic library initialization also
takes a lot of time nowadays, and probably you have localisation which
is big too. Sometimes, just wiping a few variables at the top of the
shell might remove some useless overhead.
