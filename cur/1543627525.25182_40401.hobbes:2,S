I have no idea what to say or who to send it to!
for 2.5.8, in init/main.c, function: start_kernel(void) -
"setup_per_cpu_areas();"
should NOT be called for single CPU systems, and kernel compiles (final
linkage) fails with it in.  A simple ifndef would fix it- I just
commented the line out and all is well. :)
Thank you!!
