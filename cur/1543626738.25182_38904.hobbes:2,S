you've completely missed the point.
for "CPU intensive" tasks (which GCC will be for large files being 
compiled), it will want to use its entire time-slice.
with HZ set at 100 for x86, that means it can run for up to 10msec without 
being preempted (if its not performing any system calls, I/O or other 
things which can cause a context-switch).
with 40 of these running, i have no doubt that you'll get skips on your audio.
are you using xmms?  if so, this has been discussed to death previously - 
and the fault lies with the userspace application.
cheers,
lincoln.
