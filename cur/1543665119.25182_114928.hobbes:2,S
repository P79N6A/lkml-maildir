Hm, good point. Perhaps a better way to do it would be:
open()
	allocate buffer
	fill buffer
read()
	copy_to_user()
write()
	copy_from_user()
	sync with driver
close()
	free buffer
Once the buffer is filled, then the user could read()/seek() on it to 
their hearts' content, without having to call the driver back. 
On a write, the user would end up modifying the desired bits of the
buffer, then sysfs would call the ->write() method, passing the entire 
buffer. 
All this assumes that the buffer will not change while the file is open, 
but for these purposes, I think that's ok to make.

Thanks.

->ioctl() - No. 
Why ->open() and ->release()? If we free the buffer in our release(), then 
why do you need a notification?

I don't think you could know that a ->read() came from the same process as 
the previous ->read(). Why would you need to know that?
Thanks,
