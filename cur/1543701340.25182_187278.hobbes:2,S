The patch below rationalizes the Kconfig documentation for the debugging
options a bit.
 * removed one occurence of 'don't enable on production systems' as this
   would imply that the other options are safe to enable on such systems.
 * added a general warning that performance may suffer (but that you should
   enable nonetheless in case of debugging), and two specific warnings, one
   for slab poisoning, a big one for page alloc debugging.
 * some spelling, added notice about /proc/sysrq-trigger to magic SysRQ
 * Removed warning about SysRQ 'only if you know what it does' - I often ask
   people to press alt-sysrq to get debugging information, only to find that
   they have it turned off, even when I would be able to understand the
   output.
Against 2.6.0 (path is wrong), please consider applying:
