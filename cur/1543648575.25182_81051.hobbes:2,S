Hi,
While running a test here, I noticed that some threads kept entering
"T" state according to ps aux.  However, rather than stop, they'd
disappear on the next process listing, as though they weren't stopped.
Further investigation revealed the following when suspending processes:
root      1497  3.8  1.7  1472  544 ttyp1    Z    00:05   0:21 find / -name pro
Yes, 'Z' for suspended, 'T' for zombie.  Something smells fishy here.
#define TASK_RUNNING		0
#define TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE	1
#define TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE	2
#define TASK_STOPPED		4
#define TASK_ZOMBIE		8
#define TASK_DEAD		16
So that's R S D T Z W, but sched.c contains R S D Z T W (Z and T
reversed).  This patch corrects sched.c.  (Should we correct
the order of bits in sched.h instead?)
