I think the fear is more that via the license you could deny any kernel 
seats.
I.e., let's say I never intend to work on reiser4 but it is part of the
source tree I would be working on via BK.  Am I at risk?
Or, what if I do not directly work on reiser4 but I do post an ancillary
patch - perhaps to fix a compile issue or update reiser4 to some new
locking change.  Am I at risk now?
I agree 100% with your intentions.  You are under no obligation to help
your competitors for free - nor should you.  But BitKeeper is now in a
position where it is a main-stay in kernel development and it is crucial
to resolve issues like this.  I do not feel arguments like "you get what
you pay for" or "that is life" are valid, anymore: developers are
relying on BK and the choice is to resolve the issues or drop BK
altogether -- not just "live with it".
