I'm an rmap fan, but this feature in fact negates one of the advantages of
rmap since since virtual scanning doesn't needs to propagate the page ref
bit into the physical page.  However, it still has to unmap pages, which
is the biggest disconnect with virtual scanning.
As Rik said, it would make rmap run a little faster, but some organization
is needed to make the ref bit propagation per-arch.
