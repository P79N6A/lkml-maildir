+static ssize_t show_uevent(struct device *dev, struct device_attribute *attr,
+                          char *buf)
+{
+       struct kobject *top_kobj;
+       struct kset *kset;
+       char *envp[32];
+       char data[PAGE_SIZE];

Who's reviewing this stuff?  The patch headers indicate that no mailing list was
