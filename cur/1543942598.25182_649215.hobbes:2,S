Hmmm... bugzilla says:
    * Exact steps to reproduce
    * Reproducability of bug (e.g. intermittent or 100% reproducable)
    * Did this problem not exist in previous version of the driver?
    * kernel version
    * AP brand/model
    * dmesg output at debug level 0x43fff
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		it would be nice to specify how to do this. It is
insmod parameter, right?
    * Type of security (if any) you are using (e.g. WEP64, WEP128, WPA, WPA2, 802.1x, etc)
    * Version of firmware
    * Version of the ieee80211 module
    * Proximity to the AP
    * Before reporting any firmware errors, please be sure to read Ben
Cahill's mailing list post on how to most effectively report such
bugs. 
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		unfortunately the link here does not work.
BTW, why not use kernel.org bugzilla? Having to create another account
is nasty...
