In a second test, I have also added messages at the end of these functions. 
They surely don't exit early indeed.
Has anybody else managed to reproduce the bug?
Does it happen with other drivers (say, PCI cards w. pcm interface)?
procedure:
	(read the last step first; it is a warning)
	1. load the sound module, like 'modprobe snd-maestro3'
	2. load the client ("artsd" should be the one, others may eventually release 
the descriptor. If you want, you could give them a try as well.) 
	3. Suspend, S1, NOT with an all-capable script. The script you use must not 
try to bring down ALSA.
	4. Resume.
	5. Check the state of the "artsd" (or equivalent) process.
	W. Note that if the process is waiting for I/O, you can do nothing but 
reboot.
