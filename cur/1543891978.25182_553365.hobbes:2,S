What I really expected is that what I was running would be save, and 
resume would restore what I was running and then jump back to where that 
suspended itself. Without having to address the issue of booting the 
"right" kernel, but having any functional kernel which was booted then 
restore whar was originally suspended.
 From discussion here, I conclude that "it could work that way but doesn't."

I'm being very careful to avoid changing the default boot kernel. If the 
system suspends (ie. deliberately) I want to resume in the running 
kernel, but if it crashes I want the cold boot to bring up a known 
stable kernel, even though that may be lacking in features, have an old 
scheduler, etc.
