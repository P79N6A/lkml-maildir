Here we go again. This question is answered in the FAQ. Could we
kindly drop this subject? Every time some luser raises this subject,
we get a chorus of "me too" responses, plus a bunch of "it won't
happen" responses from those who know the routine.
People, this is getting very annoying. This has got to be one of the
most useless and futile repeat threads on this list.

Linus publishes the official kernel. He does what's convenient for
*him*. No amount of whinging will ever make him change to a system
that is less convenient to *him*. Live with it.

Yes, this subject has popped up before. And there *is* a final
result. It is sitting right there in the FAQ for people who aren't too
lazy to bother reading it. And each and every message on linux-kernel
tells you where the FAQ is:
> Please read the FAQ at

And the FAQ indeed mentions the option of someone providing a
splitting service. You may even get kernel.org to host and distribute
it, so you don't have to worry about disc space. You just need someone
to put in the effort.
But until someone puts in the effort to provide this service, everyone
should shut up about this topic. Everything I have seen suggests that
Linus is inclined to put *more* drivers into the kernel, rather than
split things out. Repeat whinging is *NOT* going to change his mind.
And considering that people line Alan and Dave aren't championing the
cause of splitting, there's just no chance of it happening.

Sorry for the rant, people, but I've had a gutful of this dumb repeat
thread. What rubs salt into the wounds is that it's clear that these
whingers clearly don't even bother to read the FAQ.
<WISHFUL THINKING>
Maybe what we need is to restrict posting access to linux-kernel to
those people who know a particular "secret". That secret should be
split into several parts and scattered in random places in the FAQ
(buried amongst the normal questions). This would force people to read
the FAQ before posting.
