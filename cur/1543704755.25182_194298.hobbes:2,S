I sent a big patch to Linus (against 2.6.2-rc2), you will find the patch at
ftp://ftp.isdn4linux.de/pub/isdn4linux/kernel/v2.6.
It fix some small problems with the CAPI2.0 implementation/AVM active cards
and is a new I4L/HiSax implementation based on the stable 2.4 code base. 
It's successfull tested by a handfull people and I run it with all cards
I own (~40 different types) without outstanding problems so far.
Currently untested:
Teles PCMCIA
Elsa PCMCIA
some old ISA cards
