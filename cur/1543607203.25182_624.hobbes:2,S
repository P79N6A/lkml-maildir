As it turns out I already have a spinlock on the update jiffies code. 
The reason one would want to use a 64-bit integer is that the compiler
does a MUCH better job of the ++, i.e. it just does an add carry.  No
if, no jmp.  I suppose I need to lock the read also, but it is not done
often and will hardly ever block.
I am beginning to think that defining a u64 and casting, i.e.:
#define jiffies (unsigned long volitial)jiffies_u64
is the way to go.
