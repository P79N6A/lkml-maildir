Hi,
I've been doing some work with nbd-servers, but it seems they are
a bit unreliable right now. It seems to be the kernel side that
is locking up. 
Doing things like 
dd if=/dev/zero of=filesys bs=1k count=1 seek=1024000
nbd-server 1234 `pwd`/filesys 
and then 
nbd-client othersystem 1234 /dev/nd0 
mke2fs /dev/nd0
mount /dev/nd0 /mnt
cp -r /usr/src/linux/ /mnt/test1
cp -r /usr/src/linux/ /mnt/test2
sync
will usually do the trick: The sync will hang in disk-wait and never
come out of it. 
In my case "othersystem" is running 2.6.20. I don't think it is
causing the problems: the nbd-server is simply waiting for the next
request. I also tried a different codebase: nbdsvr. Same thing. 
Anybody else see this?
	Roger.

Q: It doesn't work. A: Look buddy, doesn't work is an ambiguous statement. 
Does it sit on the couch all day? Is it unemployed? Please be specific!
