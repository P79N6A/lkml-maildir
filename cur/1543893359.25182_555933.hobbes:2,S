so both parport and serial is on the same IRQ: #7, but the parport one 
does not support shared interrupt lines (IRQF_SHARED). You can probably 
change the mapping in the BIOS (change the serial one to say IRQ#3 or 
IRQ#4). I suspect you dont have any real parallel port hardware 
attached? (and probably no serial port hardware either?) So you can 
safely ignore this.
