Directory doesn't *contain* files. It refers to them. If you don't
understand that - you don't understand the basics of UNIX filesystems.
That's where the confusion comes from.

And it isn't. It contains the reference to object that can become garbage
when you remove this directory.

Yes it is. Names are not an issue. It's a filesystem, not a filemanager.
Directory is empty if it contains nothing except references to itself and
its parent.
