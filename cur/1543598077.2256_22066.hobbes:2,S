He is using NTFS. I recognize my error message. (-; [A little omission of 
mine results in not getting the string "NTFS: " printed at the beginning of 
the error message. )-: Fixed in my tree and will be in next patch release.]
Peter,
Could you tell me whether on startup (or whenever you mount the NTFS 
volume) it doesn't give a message but saying: "Trying to open system file 
9!" or "Opening system file 9!".
If you only get the _clear_inode message that would be bad, but if you get 
a corresponding "Trying to open..." message, then just ignore them for the 
moment. - This is part of stage one of a cleanup in ntfs system file 
handling and this is just a message telling you someone is trying to close 
a system file which hasn't been opened yet, which should indeed never 
happen. - This will disappear with my next update to ntfs which completes 
the system file cleanup stuff.
If you only get the _clear_inode message this is very bad and I would like 
to know more... but I suspect you will find the matching message.
Best regards,
Anton
