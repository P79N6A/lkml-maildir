Agreed 100%, this is roughly what would happen with select() as well which      
IMO is good (not surprising behaviour) for event loop writers: it would         
return with both bits set. The EEXIST we were getting before this patch         
would be analogous to select() returning an error if you set 2 bits that        
where for fd's sharing an object (even across read/write bit vectors).          
One could argue at the logic of having 2 fd's get read events on a              
shared underlying object, but one read and the other write certainly            
makes sense as discussed earlier.                                               
Thanks again,
