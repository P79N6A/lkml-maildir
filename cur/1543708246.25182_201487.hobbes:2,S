Arjan suggested it some time ago already. In fact I implemented it, it's in the current code.
But it caused data corruption with a few devices, in particular 3ware, so I had 
to disable it again. I didn't find a bug in the code. It worked fine with others. My theory 
was that it triggered some hardware bug that was normally masked by the frequent flushes, but 
I wasn't able to track it down without heavy equipment.
Currently it is in there, but disabled by default. Can be enabled with iommu=nofullflush.
Also the other part of the dumbness is that the flush is global, not per mapping. I guess
you don't have that problem on Sparc64.
Anyways, even with these restrictions having the GART as IOMMU is much better than
doing software bouncing.
