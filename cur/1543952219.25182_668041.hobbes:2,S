As far as I understood, the VM_IO flag simply means that the page is
used for IO. On some architectures this automatically means that the
page is not cached, but this is not guaranteed. That's why
pgprot_noncached() exists.
If I misunderstood something or somebody can explain it better, please
let me know.

It _is_ trivial. It's just something you don't need every day, and
therefore it's not known to everybody (including me) or not obvious.
But if you look at it:
VM_IO means IO
pgprot_noncached means noncached
What could be more trivial?
Thanks,
