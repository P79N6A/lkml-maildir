True, but in the write method of the /proc file, it is fairly easy to do a
for_each_process(p) and change the uid of all priviledged processes, so
init will get the new super-uid.

Maybe, but there are more implications. What about nfs and NO_ROOT_SQASH,
ore what about /etc/hosts.equiv ? Memory manadgment in also an issue here
since priviledged processes are allowed to get_free_pages even in very low
memory situations.
These are just a few examples, and I am now at the stage of looking for as
many implications as possible in order to write properly design an
apropriate tactic that would deal with all of this. Anyway, just fully
understanding all the aspects of the kernel is in it's self a finality.

OK, but there won't be such system call. The goal of this is to set an
array of 500 possible users that could be root (including 0). This would
mean that an exploit would have to try many uids before getting somewhere,
and if root is paranoid, he can change his ID 5 times a day. Then the
exploits would only work for a fairly short time.

OK, this sounds like a valid opinion... Thank you for your feedback.
