NO! This IS topic for this list. Since ONLY when "sample implementation" for
userspace part exists you can be shure that kernel part is "good enough".
Take a look on LinuxThreads: THREE YEARS was needed to add some important
pieces to kernel for proper implementation of LinuxKernels. Just since
initially it was decided that actual implementation is user space problem
and should not bother kernel developers.
