Whoops! Well that got me able to mount it. Thanks!
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/zero-`date +%s`
has caused pdflush to block IO, any access to /mnt and the process
does not return. other than the pdflush load of ~99% the box seems to
function normally. 2.6.7-bk6, seagate drive
I enabled some video options which seem to have blanked my display,
wrong driver, bug or overscanning text console (?), not sure; but I'll
follow up with more detailed sata report when I get video okay (at least
24 hrs).
