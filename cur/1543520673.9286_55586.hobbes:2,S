Hi,
as was mentioned on Kernel Traffic, the spin_unlock optimization (movb $0,%0
instead of lock; btrl $0,%0) is not used at last. But could there be a
detection routine (I know this is not a completely new and innovative idea)
for those older PPro CPUs that require the slow version so that in the sane
cases the optimization would be used. At least, IMHO it should be a
compile-time option (defaulting to the slow version) to activate the fast
version.
Greetings,
Oliver Henning
