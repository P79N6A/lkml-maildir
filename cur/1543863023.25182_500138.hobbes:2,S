yes, that option was implemented in a half-assed sort of way.  if you
look at compiler-gcc4.h, at first glance the preprocessing looks like
it's doing the right thing for that config option:
==================================
#include <linux/compiler-gcc.h>
#ifdef CONFIG_FORCED_INLINING
# undef inline
# undef __inline__
# undef __inline
# define inline                 inline          __attribute__((always_inline))
# define __inline__             __inline__      __attribute__((always_inline))
# define __inline               __inline        __attribute__((always_inline))
#endif
==================================
  but it's too late for checking that kernel config option, since
compiler-gcc.h has already been included, which includes:
==================================
#define inline          inline          __attribute__((always_inline))
#define __inline__      __inline__      __attribute__((always_inline))
#define __inline        __inline        __attribute__((always_inline))
==================================
so, as you say, "__always_inline and inline are currently equivalent".
which is sort of confusing and might come as a nasty surprise to some
developers who weren't expecting that.
