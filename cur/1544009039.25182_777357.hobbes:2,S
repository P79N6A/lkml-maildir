Other pids get allocated per task. In the beginning of copy_process we 
have:
        if (pid != &init_struct_pid) {
                retval = -ENOMEM;
                pid = alloc_pid(task_active_pid_ns(p));
Where alloc_pid allocates a pid structure. But this is only done if it is
not a swapper task.

Do I need to change the loop to do_each_pid_thread?
I'll try that later today.
