the following 3 patches are the backports to 2.6.22, 2.6.23 and 2.6.24 
of a CPA bug we found while writing 2.6.25's new CPA code.
the bug affects the 64-bit kernel on two popular Linux distros, Fedora 
and Ubuntu:
   $ grep RELOCA /boot/config-2.6.23.9-85.fc8
     CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y
   $ grep RELOC /boot/config-2.6.22-14-generic
     CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y
havent checked more.
(There are no upstream commits for this because this code is not present 
in the new code.)
