do you have any actual technical objections, or do you just hate
hrtimers in general?
I really don't see what you hate so much about making the msleep()
implementation provide a more precise (typical sleep time of 1msec
rather than 20msec) behavior than the current one. Trying to distract
that by proposing a very different API (working on a totally different
time unit, while a lot of kernel users are using miliseconds; don't get
me wrong, a usleep() and nsleep() might be useful if there's users that
want to sleep in such times) is just trying to distract the issue.
So, let me ask a direct question: What do you think is specifically
wrong about changing the msleep() implementation as is done here? The
behavior is clearly an improvement, so what is your objection on the
flipside?
