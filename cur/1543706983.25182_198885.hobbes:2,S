Yes, there is. I'm going to collect it and put something together.

The current on-disk-layout is compatible with cryptoloop. The IV
generation mechanism is flexible though and will be extended to allow
for a more secure IV generation (like using a hash algorithm).
At the moment it supports no IC (ECB mode) or plain IV (sector number
truncated to 32 bit as IV).
