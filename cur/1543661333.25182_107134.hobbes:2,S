As long as this doesn't mean a 50.000 kilo locomotive will ride over my 
keyboard, it is fine with me.
Oh, and I don't want to destroy the American dream, but blinking lights on 
railroad crossings even exist in the poorest countries in Africa... Or do the 
Americans even have a patent on the blinking speed ? :-P
Sidenote: you can't speak of "the middle", the LED ordering is free :) At 
least here in Europe...

Besides, I'd like to see some beeps (not too annoying please) besides the 
blinking. Sometimes while debugging KGI I don't even notice the kernel 
entered kdb (also blinking LEDs, and kdb shows up on a remote terminal). 
Also: servers will usually have keyboard switches, making the blinks unnoted. 
But I assume that has been said before.
