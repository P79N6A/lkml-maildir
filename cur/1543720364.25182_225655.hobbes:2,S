Ok i fixed it. Was a RAM installation problem. I've had trouble with RAM in
this board before. When i initialy set it up, the RAM modules being in 2&3 3
was the only i could get it to boot.
However i had a few more tries and i got a single DIMM bootting the machine
and then i tried two. It didnt boot, so i wirggled it and it work? very
strange. I think the DDR slots may not be up to scratch, but its working...
o rat least, seems to be.
Thanx for your help, even though it wouldnt have been neccessary if i had
taken more care in installing the RAM. *color me red faced*
Thanx again.
