Yep. And Am I able to switch mapping off completely without tweaking
with the kernel? I don't mean echo <some-ugly-escape-sequence> 'cause
it has to be done for every vc and its effect disappears when a
terminal reset is done. "setfont -m trivial" appears to do the same.
Any suggestions? If I have to replace the mapping table in the kernel
source, I'll do it but not happily since I have to do it before every
kernel upgrade..
