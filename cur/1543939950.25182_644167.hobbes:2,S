since your device is responsible for sending data from/to local memory. ISA dma 
controller has only 2 registers -- 16-bit address to put incoming data to (get 
outcoming from) + 8-bit nonincrementing page and 16-bit counter.

since isa dma controller can address up to 2^24 (16-bit address + 8-bit page) 
bytes of memory, i.e. 16M.
Are you sure, you want use this API?
