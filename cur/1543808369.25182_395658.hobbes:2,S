With additional_cpus you don't need maxcpus. They are added together.
Also for Xen it's probably not needed by default, but the hypervisor can somehow
pass it (it doesn't make sense to have more vcpus than real cpus
and that should be relatively small number, so the memory waste
shouldn't be that bad). 
On x86-64 there is also a new firmware
way to specify it, but current machines don't support that yet.
