Yes.
A difference of 1 in the event counters isn't considered enough to
treat on of them as old, and presumably the newest one (sda2) was
marked clean.
This could happen if the array was shut down cleanly, the new super
block (with the dirty bit cleared) was written to sda2, but the new
superblock was NOT written to sdb2 for some reason.  In this situation
there is no need to resync the array.
Could this be what happened in your case?
