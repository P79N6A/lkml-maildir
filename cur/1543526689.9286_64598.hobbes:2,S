flush_page_to_ram I understand -- it is trying to compensate for
systems without coherent dma.  If I have coherent dma, I don't 
need to do anything.
hw_resend_irq I don't understand.  All I see is one implementation
that uses hw to re-send an interrupt to either the local cpu or
to the system (it is not immediately obvious which).  The sole
comment I find about IRQ_REPLAY is "when Linux resends an IRQ
that was dropped earlier".  But unlike x86, we have no method
to resend, and it certainly appears that a noop would not accomplish
what the code expects.
Please enlighten me.
