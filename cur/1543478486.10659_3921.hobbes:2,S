Hi Greg,
It needs quotes from Linus.
It needs quotes from Linux vendors.
It needs quotes from satisfied users.
It needs the active voice.  Badly.
It needs a lead sentence.
Check out 
http://www.samba.org
 for a decent press release.
Here's my draft ... ALL THE QUOTES ARE FICTITIOUS.

    <FICTITIOUS>
    Santa Clara, CA -- Linus Torvalds announced the release of
    Linux Kernel 2.2.  The Linux Kernel is an advanced multi-tasking
    UNIX-compatible operating system suitable for desktop, server,
    and embedded systems.
    <FICTITIOUS>
    Linux Kernel 2.2 is an update to Linux Kernel 2.0, which was released
    in July 1996.  Version 2.2 features more foo, faster blah, and
    support for a wide array of bletch, including interoperability
    with whatever.
    <FICTITIOUS>
    Torvalds distributes Linux Kernel under the Gnu Public License,
    an open-source license originally developed by the Free Software
    Foundation.  "It's incredible how much open source leverages my
    development," said His Penguin Majesty.  "I don't so much write
    Linux Kernel as edit it.  I would like to thank everyone on the
    kernel development team who contributed to the development effort and
    participated in the open beta testing."  The simulacrum of Torvalds
    went on to add "The author of this *fictitious* press release
    made up all these quotes for illustrative purposes, and any news
    source that gets hold of a garbled copy and reports it as real news
    is going to be a laughingstock."
    <FICTITIOUS>
    Bob Young, CEO of Red Hat Software, said: "we were pleased to be
    a sponsor of Linux Kernel 2.2 development.  The kernel is at the
    heart of Red Hat Linux."  The imaginary copy of Young went on to say
    "we intend to ship Red Hat Linux X.Y based on Linux Kernel 2.2 in
    the blah quarter of whenever.  But watch out, everything in this
    paragraph is a fictitiuos quote for illustrative purposes too."
    <FICTITIOUS>
    So and so, spokesman for SuSE, said: "....".
    <FICTITIOUS>
    More vendor quotes.
    <FICTITIOUS>
    Big Important Guy from Intimidating Computers commented "Linux is hot.
    We are seeing a rising tide of Linux interest from our customers, and
    Linux Kernel 2.2 is a key part of our Linux product plans."
    <FICTITIOUS>
    More commercial partner quotes.
    <FICTITIOUS>
    John Q. Hacker at Impressive Organization said "we have been using
    the beta versions of Linux Kernel 2.2 for N months now.  We have
    been very happy with the additional frotz.  The beta feedback cycle
    is very responsive; when we report a problem, we often see it fixed
    in the next beta version.  Our experience has been that the later
    beta versions of Linux are more stable and reliable then production
    versions of other operating systems."
    <FICTITIOUS>
    Now get into the feature list.
    <FICTITIOUS>
    As an open-source product, Linux Kernel 2.2 is available for
    immediate download on the World Wide Web at www.kernel.org.
