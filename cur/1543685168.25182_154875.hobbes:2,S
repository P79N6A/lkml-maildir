Hm, the hardware may not be that widespread. I guess not many people are really
using SMP, 64 bit PCI network, 3 GB RAM, 3ware RAID5 and serverworks board
altogether in one box. I can't fight the impression it has something to do with
locking issues. It doesn't look exactly like a hardware problem, you would not
expect crashes on the same type of code then.
The question is: what additional information is needed to find the underlying
problem?
