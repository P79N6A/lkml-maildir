2.5.25: 2 problems found
1) Options under Input Device Support and under Character Devices: Mice
are duplicates from a user's point of view. Fortunately they have different 
names (CONFIG_PSMOUSE vs CONFIG_MOUSE_PS2).
Unfortunately they both seem to be used...did a recursive grep.
2)  This is a compilation error, which has been in 2.5 since 3 kernels ago or 
so. Reported twice on LKML by me, as well as another person. No reply. 
mpparse.c: In function `mp_parse_prt':
mpparse.c:1080: warning: implicit declaration of function `mp_find_ioapic'
mpparse.c:1083: `mp_ioapic_routing' undeclared (first use in this function)
mpparse.c:1083: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
mpparse.c:1083: for each function it appears in.)
mpparse.c:1107: warning: implicit declaration of function 
`io_apic_set_pci_routing'
