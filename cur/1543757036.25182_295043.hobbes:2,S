Just catching up on this thread.  I guess I'm ultimately surprised that
the developers here don't create a system *they* like with *their*
knowledge and skillsets.  
With all of the complaining about BK you'd think there'd be an equal
alternative.
For everyone not liking Larry nor BK, why don't you use that as
inspiration to develop together a better app with terms more agreeable? 
Surely that would put a bit of vinegar in his p*ss, wouldn't it?
