Thanks. These PREEMPT_RT debugging features should be disabled:
> CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT=y
> CONFIG_WAKEUP_TIMING=y
> CONFIG_PREEMPT_TRACE=y
> CONFIG_LATENCY_TIMING=y
> CONFIG_RT_DEADLOCK_DETECT=y
they all cause significant overhead.
I'd also disable these two security options:
> CONFIG_AUDIT=y
> CONFIG_SECURITY=y
unless you are running an selinux-enabled environment.
i've had not that good experiences with HPET:
> CONFIG_HPET_TIMER=y
> CONFIG_HPET_EMULATE_RTC=y
so i'd disable it - but YMMV.
i'd also disable PAE and use CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM:
> CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G=y
unless you have more than 4GB of RAM. (if you have between 1GB and 4GB 
then use HIGHMEM4G)
then i'd disable stack-overflow checking as well:
> CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW=y
> CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE=y
since you are not running 4K stacks.
