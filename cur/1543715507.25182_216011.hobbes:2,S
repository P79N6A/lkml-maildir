except disks no longer encode one bit at a time (with prml), and you're
still serializing requests across all the spindles instead of dividing
requests between spindles... it's pretty clear that in the forseeable
future capacity grown will continue to far outstrip access speed in
spinning magnetic media. I would agree that any serious improvement is
likely to come for more creativly arranging the data at the block or
filesystem level, netapps log-structured raid4 being one direction to 
head...
