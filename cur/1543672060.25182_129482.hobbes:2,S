Hello.
Sorry for the pretty OT and stupid question, but i just started getting 
interested in the linux kernel, so i downloaded kernel 2.5.68. Trying to 
run 'make xconfig' i got into the message 'you don't have installed 
qt!'...so the xconfig is now dependant from qt? why? what about us poor 
guy who only use twm and not kde? isn't qt pretty big and fat? ah well, 
falling back to menuconfig...
thanks for your patience.
