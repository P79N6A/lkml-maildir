Subject: Is that an acceptable interface change?

I'm looking at the changes in the asound.h file, and especially at
commit 512bbd6a85230f16389f0dd51925472e72fc8a91, and I've been
wondering if it's acceptable compatibility-wise.  All the structures
passed through ioctl (and ALSA is 100% ioctl) have been renamed from
sndrv_* to snd_*.  That breaks source compatibility but not binary
compatibility.
Ignoring the fact that the changelog comment utterly fails to mention
that part of the change, is keeping compatibility supposed to be
binary-only or source too?
  OG.
