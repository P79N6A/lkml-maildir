_What_ different paths?  And what "two of something"?
The only requirement for fs that want to report wider st_ino is
to put the right value into kstat->ino in their ->getattr().
And there's already a plenty of filesystems using iget5() et.al.
for icache lookups - this isn't adding anything new.
As far as 64bit ino_t is concerned - no, thanks.  We'd need to walk through
all existing fs code and audit existing uses of ino_t.  Which is far more
of support burden.
And then there's an issue of overhead on normal icache lookups for nearly
all existing filesystems; ones that do wider lookup keys are *already* using
iget5(), BTW.   So you'll simply punish all users of iget().
