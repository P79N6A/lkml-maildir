Right, which is why volatile is wrong. Which is what we've all been saying. 
Constantly.
You need the barrier for both the CPU and the compiler. The CPU barrier comes 
from an instruction like '*fence' on x86 (or a locked bus op), while the 
compiler barrier comes from the memory clobber. Because the spinlocks already 
_must_ have both of these (including the other constraints in the inline 
asm), 'volatile' on the spinlock ctr is useless.

Special case? It's the topic of this thread.
As for barrier() being a compiler boundary versus a hardware boundary, I don't 
think anyone is disputing that. Which is why I speak of both compiler and 
hardware barriers:

Documentation/memory-barriers.txt covers barriers pretty thoroughly. barrier() 
is a Linux macro that is part of a suite of macros to implement various kinds 
of barriers in various situations. Hardware equivalent? How about mb()?

Documentation/memory-barriers.txt lists situations like the ones I describe. 
It's not pure C -- you end up having to insert a hardware barrier too, but 
Linux makes many macros available to do so. (Of course, these macros are 
using inline asm). Notice I specifically mention hardware barriers in the 
paragraph above. When I say one use-case of memory barriers is to safely 
write lock-free code, I'm talking about the use of both hardware and compiler 
barriers (indeed, _both_ types of barriers are documented in 
Documentation/memory-barriers.txt, along with examples of lock-free C code 
supported by Linux barrier macros).
Thanks,
