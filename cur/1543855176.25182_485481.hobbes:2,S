Good catch. In the page clustering patches I work on, I am doing this;
-       page = alloc_page_vma(gfp | __GFP_ZERO, &pvma, 0);
+       page = alloc_page_vma(
+                       set_migrateflags(gfp | __GFP_ZERO, __GFP_RECLAIMABLE),
+                                                               &pvma, 0);
to get rid of the MOVABLE flag and replace it with __GFP_RECLAIMABLE. This 
clustered the allocations together with allocations like inode cache. In 
retrospect, this was not a good idea because it assumes that tmpfs and 
shmem pages are short-lived. That may not be the case at all.

Indeed. I believe that making page tables movable would gain more.

Thanks for that clarification. I suspected that something like this was 
the case when I removed the MOVABLE flag and used RECLAIMABLE but I wasn't 
100% certain. In the tests I was running, tmpfs pages weren't a major 
problem so I didn't chase it down.

Agreed.

I'll roll this into the movable patch, run a proper test and post a new 
patch Monday.
Thanks
