Hi,
  I have some queries regarding Interrupt handling in serial.c
 1.I find that a macro called CONFIG_SERIAL_SHARE_IRQ is used for sharing
 Interrupts.
 If this is set then serial.c can be used for shared interrupts.
 But I checked in arch/i386/kernel/irq.c the function 
 set_x86_irq tells that sharing can happen If we set flag to SA_SHIRQ
 Without this being set the interrupt is being shared by two modems using
serial.c How is this possible?
 2.If the flag is set to fast interrupt(SA_INTERRUPT) will I be able to
have
shared interrupts.
 Should I set the flag to slow and do sharing of interrupts.
3.And what is significance of dev_id in sharing of interrupts?
 As in free_irq function based on dev_id the interrupt is shared.
4.By sharing of interrupts the machine is slow . will this happen due to
sharing?
 If so how to overcome this.
