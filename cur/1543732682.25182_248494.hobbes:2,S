These kinds of people would use something like file-roller in GNOME, 
and they'd care not a jot whether file-rollers used built-in 
tar support, and/or openat() or via file-as-dir fs support.
All they care about is that they get a window with icons for their 
files that they can click on. How it's done does not matter - it only 
matters to those who must write the code.
