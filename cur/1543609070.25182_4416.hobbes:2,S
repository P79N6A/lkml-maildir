linux/cpufreq.h is a generic framework for controlling the CPU clock speed
(and therefore the power).  It isn't merged into 2.4 yet (I was hoping to
get he generic framework merged into 2.4-ac around start of October, but
alas it didn't happen).
It's going to be merged in 2.5, and then backported to 2.4.

Yes, these are ARM specific.  make dep creates the dependencies for all
files in the directory, and as such causes this problem.  That said, it
is harmless on x86, and safe to ignore these messages.
