By that definition there are still a lot of candidates out-side the IDE
world. The x86 versus x86-64 is irrelevant here. The point is that
kconfig is used to select only relevant options for any given
architecture and with the above definition we could simply boil it down
to "make only what cannot compile for an arch non-selectable".
We have a nice kconfig system that is extensively used to secure we have
a valid kernel configuration all the time and we go long to secure this.
Should we now start to breake that apart to start to give drivers more
compile coverage just becasue that's a tad easier. That brakes the
fundamental of the kconfig in the first place namely to secure valid
configurations.
It is nto the IDE patch as such that is the topic here. It is the
general issue if kconfig at all shall allow one to select drivers that
is not suitable for your HW. Tomorrow it will be a bunch of ARM
drivers..
