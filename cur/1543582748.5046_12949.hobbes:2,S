Hi,
I wrote a patch against 2.2.18 and 2.4.1 to have the kernel generate random
PIDs.
You can find it at 
http://vanheusden.com/Linux/security.php3
 (amongst other
patches).
Beware: pretty much experimental and likely to make your linux-pc perform
like a
win95 platform.
Greetings,
Folkert van Heusden
