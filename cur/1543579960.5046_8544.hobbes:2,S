Perfect, I was thinking exactly the same thing.  We have to be careful here
though, since the extra schedules will increase the chance the searching
has to be redone from scratch, which can have big performance ramifications.
I think your change to search_by_key will be the safest for performance
considerations, along with the change to prepare_for_delete_or_cut.  If
those won't be enough, we can attack reiserfs_get_block (who is probably
the biggest single offender without your patch).
