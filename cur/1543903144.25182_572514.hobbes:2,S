I tracked down why indent does this.  It's actually hard-coded to indent
by 2 fewer columns than the current code indentation.  I've patched it
to allow specifying either an absolute column, or a column relative to
the current indentation level.
Patch here:

Of course, we can't add this flag to Lindent until it's widely
circulating amongst the distributions.  Perhaps we can add this to
Lindent in the meantime:
sed -i -e 's/^\t*      \(\w*:\)/ \1/' "$@"
which will replace the leading tabs and spaces with one space.
It should leave case labels unmolested, as they should be indented with
tabs, not 6 spaces.
Any regexp ninjas want to have a go at something better?
