No offense, please, but I really think David is being very reasonable.
The normal "Linux way" is to have zero overhead unless something is 
actually used -- witness spinlocks on UP versus SMP.
Regardless of whether some people feel the "majority" will be using LSM 
at some point in the future, David's point is very valid today, and for 
some time to come.
Finally, I was under the impression that Greg KH agreed that it is 
possible to eliminate this overhead?  Maybe I recall incorrectly.
Respectfully,
