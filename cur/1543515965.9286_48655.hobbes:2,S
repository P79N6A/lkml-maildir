	Well, the evidence certainly does show performance problems under load,
even if it is equal to all descriptors:
CPU states: 37.6% user, 62.3% system,  0.0% nice,  0.0% idle
CPU states: 50.1% user, 49.8% system,  0.0% nice,  0.0% idle
	However, load or no load, you still can't select on more than about 16,000
file descriptors:
kmalloc: Size (165072) too large
kmalloc: Size (165232) too large
	This is with 2.3.27.
