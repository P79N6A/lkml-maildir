EFI GPT is also a far more elaborate scheme than is necessary for a
lot of installations.
My 'requirements' are:
* Good magic
We have seen support for not very widely used partitioning schemes
broken in the past when other schemes are checked for ahead of them.
A simple scheme with well defined magic values reduces this risk.
* Simple
The code for some of the partitioning schemes is full of workarounds
for different implementations.  Added complexity, and more variations
increase the likelyhood of bugs.
* All partition information stored in one partition table
Linked lists make re-arranging partitions, and backing up the
partition table more difficult.
* Support for more than 4 partitions
This is a common requirement now.
* Support for partitions > 2TB
This will become a standard requirement in a few years.
* No mention of CHS
CHS is so last year.  Modern systems don't even need it to boot.  We
could allow all of the CHS-related code to be configured out of the
kernel, which would be useful on some embedded systems.
The Ultrix partition code comes fairly close to what I'm thinking of,
but not close enough :-).
John.
