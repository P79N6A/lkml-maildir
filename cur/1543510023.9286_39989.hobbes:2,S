Alan and crew--
I realize this is a very old post, but I just got my hands 
on one of these SmartRAID V cards.  I was wondering if anyone
had talked to DPT regarding this situation?
I called up and talked to the regional salesperson (Becky 
Sharp) who covers my area (Ohio, USA).  I explained how allowing
the driver to be integrated in to the Linux distribution by making
the driver completely "free" (ie, dropping the silly license BS
that you quoted, Alan) would benefit both the Linux community
and DPT (in the form of increased usage and sales).  She was
under the impression that this had already been done and upon
finding out this was not the case, seemed all for assisting the
Linux community in doing so.
Per her suggestion, I wrote a somewhat detailed email and sent
it to her for distribution to the Marketing, Development, and 
Management Divisions at DPT.  I reitereate she seemed more then
willing to do what she could to assist the community.
Bascially I'm just wondering if this is ground previously traveled
and Becky is just giving me a song-and-dance, or if DPT might 
seriously be willing to consider dropping their non-GPLable-clause.
Naturally I would like to be able to make use of this card in current
and future boxes, but I cannot do so if a side effect is waiting for
DPT to develop drivers before I can upgrade kernels.

|  It can't go into the kernel
