this is very simple to do, and does not necessiate thread-directories.  
There's a PID and TGid field in /proc/PID/status. Just link the task to
the TGid-task, and you have instant access to all threads per TGid. In the
'groupped output' case you have to scan & access all threads anyway. Ok?
(but this is way offtopic. The changes we posted address the normal case
of process-listing. (no -m option.) If there are tons of threads around
then any discussed variant of 'ps -m' will be slow.)
