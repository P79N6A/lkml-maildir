this is actually a bit of a legal iffy point here. People submit patches
to the kernel (which is GPL). In addition, while patches to gpl code are
gpl (by the gpl "derived works" clause), the MIT license has no such
requirement or even assumption on derived works so it's all quite iffy.
I strongly suggest you put the dual license header in those files to get
rid of the ambiguity..  as you said it's not really a big deal in that
the code already is dual licensed in effect; please consider making it
explicit, it solves a lot of ambiguity.
