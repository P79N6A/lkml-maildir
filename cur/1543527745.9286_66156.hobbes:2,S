OK, the problem is that gcc expects size_t to be an unsigned int.  We use
unsigned long for size_t in the kernel because we want it to be 64 bits on
64-bit PPCs (like it is on the other 64-bit platforms).  Gcc doesn't like a
prototype for memcpy which has an unsigned long for the 3rd argument
(unless you use -fno-builtin).
The only optimization we lose with -fno-builtin (that I can see) is that
the compiler won't turn explicit calls to memcpy with a small constant 3rd
argument (<= 32) into a sequence of inline loads and stores.  (It still
does small struct copies with inline loads and stores even with
-fno-builtin.)
