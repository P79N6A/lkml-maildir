Hmmm, maybe I should have said "network address" instead of being lazy :-).

You don't need forwarding turned on to generate packets. There are
probably many processes already running. There may even be existing
routes to the network/remote host via other interfaces/gateways
which you did not want to replace or override.

This is like saying we should do it the Windows way because that's
the way Windows does it :-). There appear to be people who have
a problem with this and can tell you why. That appears to be reason
enough why we should consider doing it differently.
