Not sure yet. There's only one user in nommu.c that shouldn't just be
changed to ksize() that I can see, and that's the one in
show_process_blocks(). That could test for VM_MAPPED_COPY and keep its
hands off otherwise. 
I can imagine situations where ->mmap returns pointers to something
that's statically allocated anyway (XIP?), where kobjsize doesn't
really make sense.
Also, looks like the WARN_ON_SLACK code has rotten, result isn't
defined in that function. Change it to base, perhaps?
