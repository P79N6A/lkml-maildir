None of these work if you have ie. following configuration:
two tulip-cards and 3c905, loading modules in order tulip, 3c905, you get
tulip eth0
tulip eth1
3c905 eth2
order 3c905, tulip gives
3c905 eth0
tulip eth1
tulip eth2
In either case there is no control over which tulip is what ethx.
With current system is is impossible to make config like
tulip eth0
3c905 eth1
tulip eth2
and there is no control over in what actual slot the card is.
solution could be something like
options tulip eth0, slot1, eth2 slot2
of course there is allways the problem that are slots defined top-down
or bottom-up.
another way might be
options tulip eth0 pcidev1, eth2 pcidev2
but then what is the relationship of pcidevs to slots.
.. oh well..
