As per recent discussions...
The list is moderated for SPAM prevention, messages from valid senders
will be forwarded manually and their email added to the whitelist.
I've changed the list config so that it no longer generates the
"subscriber-only" notification.
On this basis I recommended the patch be NAKd so that people aren't put
off copying the list where appropriate.
Thanks,
Regards,
Hugh
