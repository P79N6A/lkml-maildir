This is the answer I got from Larry McVoy about some of his smp ideas.
I wanted to throw these ideas on the table for the list to toss 
around. Larry agreed. The original idea was HOW (not whether, so lets
no point this in that direction) to implement a multi-kernel os (using the 
current linux base).

I am thinking that there may be another protocol that would fit the need
and could be implemented vitually (tcp/udp) to fill the communication
need between the individual kernels. But maybe this is the cart before
the horse sort of thing.
Where do we have to start to get this up and running on an intel
platform. That is probably most common (although I would bet its the least
common smp implementation.
The first challenge I see is to get the "intial" kernel to do the system
analysis and load its sibling.
Thoughts?
