Subject: [BUG][debian-2.6.20-1-686] bridging + vlans + "vconfig rem" == stuck kernel

I've managed to fairly reliably trigger a deadlock in some portion of  
the linux networking code on my Debian test box (using the debian  
kernel linux-image-2.6.20-1-686).  I'm pretty sure that it's a race  
condition of some sort as it doesn't trigger if I ifdown the  
interfaces one by one, but if I run "ifdown -a" then it triggers  
halfway through reliably (although not with the same reference count  
numbers, once it was 6, this time it was 2).
The message I get is: "unregister_netdevice: waiting for world0 to  
become free. Usage count = 2"
My /etc/network/interfaces file uses a couple custom-made if-pre-up.d  
and if-post-down.d scripts to set up the bridges and VLANs a little  
more cleanly than the standard debian scripts do, but the general  
configuration is as follows:
net0: Tigon-3 onboard gigabit NIC, hooked to managed switch, untagged  
packets
   wfi0: (net0.2 before renaming) WAP-connected VLAN 2 on the managed  
switch
   world0: (net0.4094 before renaming) Internet connection, runs DHCP
lan: Local Area Network bridge of "net0" and "wfi0" (current box has  
lowest STP priority)  This will eventually also have another untagged- 
only ethernet port attached to it.
   lan:0: Alias for acting as primary nameserver
world: pseudo-bridge of "world0" for highly-available DHCP client.
Just for a bit of background on why this is so complex:  When I get  
this networking problem sorted out I'm going to set up heartbeat and  
a dummy "world1" interface with a shared MAC which is added to the  
"world" bridge when the current system is the DHCP-client master.   
Hopefully that way I can have 3 systems act as a highly-available  
router.  Whichever one is currently the master will add the dummy  
world1 interface with shared MAC address to its "world" bridge and  
bring dhcp3-client up on the "world1" interface with the latest copy  
of the leases file from the previous master (even if the previous  
master mysteriously crashed.  This should keep my public IP from  
changing unnecessarily and should allow me to reboot any one of the 3  
router/firewall/mailserver/fileserver/etc systems without adversely  
affecting the internet connection or other critical services.
Eventually I plan to add ebtables to help filter traffic between wfi*  
interfaces and untagged VLAN-1 net* interfaces, but for now there's  
no filtering.
Anyways, after the unregister_netdevice messages start popping up all  
sorts of networking related things start to hang hard in the kernel;  
I can't "ip link set down" any interfaces, etc.  I've captured sysrq  
dumps of the process state on the system at the time with most  
processes.  See the attached syslog.bz2 file.
The important part is probably the stuck "vconfig" process, but I  
don't really understand enough about the timer stuff to interpret  
that backtrace.

There's also a whole bunch of processes stuck in netdev_run_todo()  
trying to lock a mutex.  This even frustratingly affects things like  
rndc which use netlink sockets:

The "zz-km-vlan" script is the bash if-post-down.d script in charge  
of disassembling VLAN interfaces.  There is an equivalent "zz-km- 
bridge" script for bridge interfaces, as well as if-pre-up.d scripts  
called "00-km-vlan" and "00-km-bridge" to create the interfaces.
If anyone has any suggestions, patches, or debugging tips I'm very  
interested to hear from you.  Thanks!
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
