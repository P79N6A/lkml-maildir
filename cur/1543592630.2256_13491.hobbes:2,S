Please see the Beowulf mailing list (www.beowulf.org) - a dual athlon system
was tested there about a month ago, and various tests were collected and run.
That system was not a final release, and AMD later expressed that they were
unhappy about the results being publicized, since they would most likely not
reflect the actual performance of dual athlons once released in a "final"
version.
It would be very interesting to see your results if you can re-run the tests
done by Robert G. Brown on the Beowulf mailing list.
