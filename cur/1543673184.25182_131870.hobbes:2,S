one thing none of you most probably wants to hear:
if this "APM idle calls" is that "HLT" stuff, then I have to tell you
that on win32 I had not such problems while using the CpuIdle tool.

as time permits. didn't mess around with ACPI or CpuFreq before.

may be, but for now somehow 2.5.69 segfaults in /etc/init.d/pcmcia :(
could be the PCMCIA changes I read in the -69 changelog
quote: "don't unload PCMCIA"
ok, it happened while loading.
anyway, waiting for -70 or some -bk* patchset that fixes PCMCIA up
any PCMCIA fixes already available in linus -bk?
does CpuFreq depend on ACPI ? just in case i8k1 doesn't have proper
ACPI support.

yep.
