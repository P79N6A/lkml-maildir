It also appears that upon a re-configuration of 2.4.3 from 2.2.17:
> cd /usr/src/linux
> cp ../linux-2.2.17/.config .
> make oldconfig
where the old configuration did not include FrameBuffer support,
then performing an Xconfig to tweak some settings and enable FB,
no default fonts were allocated.  This is contrary to CML1 behavoir.
> grep ^CONFIG_FB .config
CONFIG_FB=y
CONFIG_FB_VESA=y
CONFIG_FB_MACH64=y
however CML1, after only selecting the applicable drivers gives:
> grep ^CONFIG_FB ~/myotherbox-2.4.3.config
CONFIG_FB=y
CONFIG_FB_VESA=y
CONFIG_FB_VGA16=y
CONFIG_FBCON_CFB8=y
CONFIG_FBCON_CFB16=y
CONFIG_FBCON_CFB24=y
CONFIG_FBCON_CFB32=y
CONFIG_FBCON_VGA_PLANES=y
