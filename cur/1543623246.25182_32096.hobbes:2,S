No.  From my previous post:

If you want this, use fcntl locks (see TDB).  If you don't tell the kernel
what you are doing (which is the reason these locks are fast), it cannot
clean up for you.
One could conceive of a solution where a process told the kernel
"here is where I keep my lock states: if I die, clean up".  Of course,
there's a race there too.
IMHO, given that the lock is protecting something which is left in an
unknown state, this is something which would require serious testing
to be proven worthwhile.
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
