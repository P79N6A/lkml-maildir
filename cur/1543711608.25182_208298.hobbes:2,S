My "solution" to this paradox (leaving the interface unchanged, even
though cow is impossible without changes) is a new flag to files.  The
user has to manually set the flag and is now in charge of anything
that might break.  Scared?  Don't set the flag.
It is a compromise, just like yours.  Imo it is a little nicer, but
there just isn't any good solution anymore, 1967 would have been the
right time for that.
