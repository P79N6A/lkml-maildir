Magnus, do you remember the thread re: exporting get_empty_filp()? What
I've meant back then was to have separate lists of struct file's, one per
superblock. Get a superblock per address family (and one for pipes) and
allocate root for it *once*. Then allocate normal dentries under said root
putting names a-la AF_UNIX-12345. BTW, separate lists of struct file's
would allow *much* cleaner code around tty's and much simpler scanning
phase in AF_UNIX garbage collector. No need to keep reference from socket
to file, BTW. (It's a layering violation, plain and simple; especially
unpleasant since sometimes we count said refecerence and sometimes we
don't. Could you spell file leaks?) I didn't finish this work yet but I'll
return to it in a week or so.
	D'oh. With all that heap of code I'll probably just follow Alan's
example and will carry a separate tree (-bird). Part will (I hope) make
its way to 2.2, the rest... well, 2.3 <shrug>
