I was coding a driver and come to a realisation that open() system call is
not a good place to prepare hardware for read or write operatioin, since
dd for example uses RDWR mode to open of= device. And there is no warranty
othewise. Generally, seems like this is a bug in Unix design, but maybe I
do not understand something. Or maybe it's a long lining bug in dd...
