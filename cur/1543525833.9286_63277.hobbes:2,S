1.   Summary
     Unable to handle kernel paging... 2.2.14 on COMPAQ with 24Mb
2.   Description
     Upgrading System from 2.0.35 to 2.2.14 in order to support upgrading a
     Compaq Deskpro 66/M from the original 16Mb of Ram to 24Mb.
     If I do not specify the append = mem=24M option in Lilo, the 2.2.14
         Kernel runs fine but I only see 16Mb.
     If I specify the append = mem=24M option in Lilo, I then do see the
        full 24Mb but then I get various problems, especially this oops.
     I have also gotten, at various times, the following messages:     
     1.   Segmentation Fault
     2.   Virtual Memory exhausted
     3.   login: no shell: no such file or directory
     4.   login: can't open cache 'etc/ld.so.cache'
     Please see additional information in Item X, Other Notes, below.

4.   Kernel version (from /proc/version)
     Linux version 2.2.14 (root@frankmkrauss.new-york.ny.us)

6.   Example Program
     N/A - from what I see of this problem, it appears that when I login to
          my second Id, I then get this problem.  The first Login appears
          to normally work O.K.

X.   Other Notes
     History of this problem
     I have been running the 2.0.35 Kernel from the Caldera Open Linux
     1.3 Distribution successfully for the past 8 Months with 16Mb.
     About two Months ago I first attempted to upgrade my Compaq by 
     adding on 8Mb more.  Without the append statement, the new Storage 
     was not reconized.  With the append statement specified, I got all
     different types of oops.  I was told by everyone on the Boards that
     unless I upgraded to the latest Kernel, no Developer would look at
     the problem, since the 2.0.35 Kernel was so old.  That is the
     reason that I'm upgrading to the latest Production Kernel.
 
     Conserning the status of the Various Components mentioned in the
     Documentation/Changes file.
     I'm in the process of updating them, one at a time, to the correct
     levels.  If some one tells me that my problem is caused by one of
     the Products in Item 7.1 above not being at the correct level, I
     will naturally consentrate on upgrading that one even though I 
     believe that the problem is in the Kernel rather than a Product.
     Conserning my Virtual Memory (Swap Space)
     I do not know if the following is of any importance but I will 
        include the information anyway.
     When I installed my System iniatially, since I had at that time 16Mb
     of Ram, I defined a 16Mb Swap Partition.  Since I added the
     additional 8Mb of Ram I have NOT increased the Swap Space for the
     following reasons:
     1.   I did not see any Doc that says that the Swap space has to be
          the same size as the Ram.
     2.   I'm extremely tight on Disk space and need every byte possible.
     3.   I assumed that with more Ram I would be doing even less Swapping
          then before.
     Uniqeness of my Problem
     A large part of my problem appears to be the fact that I'm running
     on a COMPAQ PC.  It seems, from what I have heard on the Boards, that
     they use some type of non-standard or Proprietary BIOS which is a
     big cause of my problems.  I think that someone with a strong
     knowledge of the Compaq way of doing things may be needed in order
     to solve this problem.
Though I'm a new person in the Linux/Unix world, I have been for many years
a System Programmer in the IBM Main Frame area and so I can follow any 
directions that some one would give me in order to debug this Problem.
Any help in solving this problem would be greatly appreciated.
Yours truly,
Frank Krauss
