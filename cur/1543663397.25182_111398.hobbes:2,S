We had a similar problem in Lustre, where we have to kmap multiple pages
at once and hold them over a network RPC (which is doing zero-copy DMA
into multiple pages at once), and there is possibly a very heavy load
of kmaps because the client and the server can be on the same system.
What we did was set up a "kmap reservation", which used an atomic_dec()
+ wait_event() to reschedule the task until it could get enough kmaps
to satisfy the request without deadlocking (i.e. exceeding the kmap cap
which we conservitavely set at 3/4 of all kmap space).
A single "server" task could exceed the kmap cap by enough to satisfy the
maximum possible request size, so that a single system with both clients
and servers can always make forward progress even in the face of clients
trying to kmap more than the total amount of kmap space.
This works for us because we are the only consumer of huge amounts of kmaps
on our systems, but it would be nice to have a generic interface to do that
so that multiple apps don't deadlock against each other (e.g. NFS + Lustre).
Cheers, Andreas
