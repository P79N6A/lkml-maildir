   [ATM]: drivers/atm/Makefile does not need this
Applied.
   [ATM]: ixmicro (now rapidwan) produces a version of these cards but
          they put the end station identifier (mac address to etherheads)
          in a different location in the eeprom.
Applied.
   [ATM]: its a good idea to make sure skb->cb is empty before passing the
          pdu's to the network stack (this will bite you on 64-bit platforms
          eventually)
Applied.  You appended the patch twice though, but I figured
that out before I applied it :-)
   [ATM]: ATM_PDU_OVHD is 0, isnt used consistently and probably should
          just go away (it might be more useful to have something like 
          hard_trailer_len).  overloading driver->tx_alloc() doesnt work
          for skb's coming from the network.  the driver->send() routine
          should just deal with poorly aligned skb's.  the default 
          alignment from alloc_tx() meets the needs for all drivers.
          further, no driver actually takes advantage of this feature.
          driver->free_rx_skb() isn't used and should just go away.
Applied.
   [ATM]: cleanup some oddities in the he driver (most are historical
          for one reason or another -- at one point iov_base did actually
          hold a pointer)  also, fixed a comment that was wrong.  the
          he finally has aal0 transmit support.
Applied, thanks Chas.
