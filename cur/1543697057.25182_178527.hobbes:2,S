	You don't need to do that.  Look, these ->open() and ->release()
are not some new methods - they are ->open() and ->release() of your
struct file.  The fact that they happen to call functions from seq_file.c
doesn't change anything - they are struct file methods, sitting in some
instance of struct file_operations.  And just as with any such instance,
you have ->owner in struct file_operations.  Which will be honoured by
open(2) - just as with any other file.
	IOW, there is no need for any special rmmod protection of iterator.
Normal protection of file methods will be enough - after all, even if
iterator is not in the same module, the code in our ->open() directly
refers to it.  I.e. we have a direct dependency and as long as module
where our file_operations are is there, the module with our iterators
will stay around.

Let me get it straight - you want an infinite file, with no EOF anywhere
and contents more or less repeating itself?  _And_ you want a working
lseek() on that?
