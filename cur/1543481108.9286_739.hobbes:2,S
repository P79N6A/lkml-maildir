I tried linux hda=1247,255,63
I have kernel 2.0.36 (Redhat 5.2 base system)
Booting off a boot floppy .... Loads up
and hda: QUANTUM FIREBALL EX10.2A 9789MB w/418kB Cache, CHS=1247/255/63,
UDMA
To my Knowledge 9789MB Not Equal 10.2Gig
If I boot up in Windows with this drive it says it should be
10263MB Total,Total LBA Sectors 20033055
Windows Finds it great (there is a 8.4? Gig limit on win95?)
whcih the disk manager fixes?
What is the problem? Me? Linux? The Bios? The Machine? Or can't I/machine
add up right?
Has anyone else here one of these HDD's in their machine?
