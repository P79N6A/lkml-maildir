- if we are ok with a loss of a kbyte or two, 2.6.17 is fine as is 
  (with my incorrect patches in).
- if we want to save that memory, we can revert the two patches and fix
  xfs to make the register calls only when hotplug cpu is defined. This
  change is also minimal. It is a step in the right direction.
Only downside i can see in reverting my patch is that if there is any
other modules that are doing the same as what xfs was doing, we might
trip in a similar oops.
