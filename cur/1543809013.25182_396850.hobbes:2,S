This patch only prefetches the swapped pages when idle and tacks them onto the 
end of the inactive list so they will be the first thing that is removed if 
we need ram in the future.
Ordinary desktops swap under ordinary workloads day to day on normal pcs. It 
is extraordinary common that one workload will swap out other applications 
and then when complete we have free ram, yet our applications are floundering 
on swapspace.
Your solution of add more memory is unrealistic. Desktops do have a limit on 
how much ram we are likely to have/can afford and our workloads have, do, and 
will for ever more outstrip all available ram. A huge chunk of linux in the 
wild is on these sort of desktops. This patch makes a substantial difference 
to ordinary desktops, is configurable on or off and it can be runtime 
enabled/disabled.
Cheers,
Con
