You need an inode anyway. So why not using the space in it? tmpfs
would only use sizeof(*inode.u)-sizeof(struct shmem_inode_info) for
this kind of symlinks.
Last time we suggested this, people ended up with some OS trying
it and getting worse performance. 
Why? You need to allocate the VFS-inode (vnode in other OSs) and
the on-disk-inode anyway at the same time. You get better
performance and less fragmentation, if you allocate them both
together[1].
So that struct inode around is ok.
BTW: Is it still less than one page? Then it doesn't make me
   nervous. Why? Guess what granularity we allocate at, if we
   just store pointers instead of the inode.u. Or do you like
   every FS creating his own slab cache?

[1] Which is true for other allocations, too.
