The library _is_ intended to be used by other applications than
the nf-hipac userspace tool, too. It hides the netlink communication
from the user who is only required to construct the command
data structure sent to the kernel which contains at most one single
nf-hipac rule. This is very straightforward and the kernel returns
detailed errors if the packet is misconstructed.
Taking a look at nfhp_com.h and evt. nf-hipac.c gives you some clue
on how to build valid command packets.
