[snip the make output]
1) You are using pgcc. Broken version, at it.
2) You could not be bothered to see if somebody had reported that earlier.
3) You could not be bothered to do what compiler told you to do - report
the thing to _compiler_ _developers_.
4) You apparently think that 5 postings of the same stuff are better than
1.
Recommendation: get a clue and working compiler.
