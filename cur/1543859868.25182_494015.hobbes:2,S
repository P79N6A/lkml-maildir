Jeff Sipek just got his proposal for a paper/discussion topic accepted to
the Linux Storage and Filesystems workshop, co-located with FAST.  The
topic for discussion will be what "surgery" the Linux kernel needs to
support stackable file systems properly.  I hope it is an indicator that
the situation with support of the stackable file systems in Linux may
improve soon.
Nikolai.
