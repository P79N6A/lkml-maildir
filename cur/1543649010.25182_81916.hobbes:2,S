	Iirc ,  Gerard said that the Sym-2 is for all chipsets again .
	see: linux/drivers/scsi/sym53c8xx_2/Documentation.txt
	The ncr53c8xx was the original driver that he produced .  Then
	came the sym53c8xx version which was NOT for the older chips
	supported by the ncr53c8xx.c .

	Yes , I noted them below using a grep of your document .  It
	appears that the SYM53c8xx driver gets loaded   THEN the
	ncr53c8xx attempts to load & of course conflicts with the
	SYM53c8xx .  These two drivers can not co-exist ,  Without very
	special care as to how they get loaded or some such .
	I still highly recommend the sym2 driver rather than either of
	the two being loaded .  But if it won't recognise the drives ...
