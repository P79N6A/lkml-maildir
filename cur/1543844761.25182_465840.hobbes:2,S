You just need to use GRE tunnel instead of what you describe above.
While i feel bad that Joerg (and Lennert and others before) have put the
effort to do the work, i too question the need for this driver. I dont
think even the authors of the original RFC feel this provides anything
that GRE cant (according to some posting on netdev that one of the
authors made). My understanding is also that the only other OS that
implemented this got it wrong - hence you will have to interop with them
and provide quirks checks.
I am actually curious if anyone uses it instead of GRE in openbsd?
You could argue that including this driver would allow Linux to have
another bulb in the christmas tree; the other (more pragmatic way) to
look at this is it allows spreading a bad idea and needs to be censored.
I prefer the later - and hope this doesnt discourage Joerg from
contributing in the future.
cheers,
jamal
