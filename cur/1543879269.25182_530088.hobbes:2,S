Which is an argument against said LSM in current form.

is a clear sign that interface is wrong.  Leaving aside the general
idiocy of "we prohibit to do something with file if mounted here,
but if there's another mountpoint, well, we just miss", an API of that
kind is just plain wrong.  Either you can live without seeing vfsmount
in that method (in which case you shouldn't pass it at all), or you
have a hole.
NACK.
