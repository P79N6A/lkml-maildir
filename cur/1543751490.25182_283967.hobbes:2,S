I'll leave that assertion to somebody with more knowledge than me, but it 
seems related to APIC, yes.
Sorry, I've only tried 2.6.7 through 2.6.10, but I'll try some earlier 2.6 
versions today, although I don't expect anything else to happen, since this 
problem also occurs on 2.4.
I'm sorry, I don't know how to gather more information which could be helpful 
for debugging if I can't even get into a shell ...
is there a kernel parameter or something like alike to collect more debugging 
information ?
