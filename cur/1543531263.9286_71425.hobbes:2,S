I figured out how to do this.  Linux 2.2 loopback interfaces are
visible to the net.  So:
  /sbin/ifconfig lo:0 10.20.30.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 mtu 1500 up
This serves the entire 10.20.30.0/24 network, replacing 254 discrete
interfaces.  Thank you, O Linux gurus, for making this possible.
Incidentally, I've received a few emails asking why we're not
using name-based virtual hosts.  The short answer is a) some
browsers don't send a "Host:" header; and b) our systems are set
up for IP hosts, which would be a pain to change.

p.s. er...just in case it's only an accident that loopback aliases
work the way they do:  I'd like to register a formal grovel that
their useful behavior remain in Linux.  Indeed, this is one
feature that blows the doors off of NT...
