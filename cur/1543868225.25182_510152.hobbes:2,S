Does this need to be in the sg driver?
What is the hardware sector size of a SES or OSD device?
As for the max_sector variable, wouldn't it be better
to generate a new ioctl that yielded the limit in bytes?
Making a driver variable that implicitly assumes sectors
are 512 bytes in length more visible to the user space
seems like a step in the wrong direction.
Alternatively the SG_GET_RESERVED_SIZE ioctl could be
modified to yield no more than max_sectors*512 .

Why first??
That would allow the block layer to overtake any currently
defined and working sg ioctl.
Surely, if it was put in, it should be in the default case.
