In fact I applied exactly this change before posting to this mailing list to 
kernel-2.6.17-1.2174_FC5 (Source rpm from fedora core 5) _without_ success. 
Thats why I thought there were also some other changes with similar effects 
in the kernel source at the same time.

In my application a child thread debugs sibling threads and the parent. 
Neither works for newer kernels.
I will try a 2.6.18-rc6 vanilla kernel with the above patch applied at home 
and give you some feedback wether there is a different result as with the 
patched 2.6.17-1.2174_FC5 kernel.

May be there are more advocates of self-debugging than expected ...
