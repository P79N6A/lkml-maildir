On the flip side, a filesystem only has to worry about who wrote which blocks
in what order.  I suspect if you tried to push the idea of a filesystem that did
the sort of intuiting of intent that BitKeeper has to do on a merge, it would
quickly get shouted down.
Unless of course somebody does BK as a Reiser4 module. :)
