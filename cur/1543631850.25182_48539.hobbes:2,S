Alessandro reported the problem to me also. I went through the i815 
specs and found 2 'strange' things (maybe they are not but...)
1) No 'ERRSTS' register (well... a bus that does no error should be a 
feature ;-)
2) The ATTBASE register to which the *_configure functions write is 
different from other Intel chipsets. In the i815, the ATT base adress 
should be written between bits 12 and 28, whereas in all other Intel 
chipsets, it should be written between bits 12 and 31 (don't ask me why 
Intel feels like changing the adresses/specs for registers at each new 
chipsets....) .
Alan, do you think this could cause all those troubles ?

 From what Alessandro reported, it seems clear that the 'insmod agpgart' 
triggers the mayhem, including memtest failures.
Best regards
Nicolas.
