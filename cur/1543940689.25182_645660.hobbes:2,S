If you don't have a pin, then things like invalidate_range in
remap_file_pages can't be safe as writes through the external TLBs can
keep going on pages in the freelist. For you to be safe w/o a
page-pin, you need to return in the direction of invalidate_page
inside ptep_clear_flush (or anyway before
page_cache_release/__free_page/put_page...). You're generally not safe
with any invalidate_range that may run after the page pointed by the
pte has been freed (or can be freed by the VM anytime because of being
unpinned cache).
