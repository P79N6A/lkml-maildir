One reason they're "evil" is that they hide what is going on.  It is
worse for structures, but doing it for arrays still hides what is there,
and a hapless programmer can easily jump off the end of the stack
without realizing it.  I think the kernel style is to be as explicit as
possible, especially when it isn't too verbose.
In this case, I expect a programmer declaring a 'char foo[XEN_FOO]'
array on the stack to be much more likely to go look up how big XEN_FOO
is than one who sees a 'xen_capabilities_info_t foo'.

The size is the issue.  A typedef just makes it a little bit harder to
track down.  That's why typedefs are evil. ;)
