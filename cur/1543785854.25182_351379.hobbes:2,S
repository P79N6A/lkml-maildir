I'm not too much into this stuff, I don't even know the technical 
differences betwen booting from kernel-on-floppy or from a bootloader. 
My proposal was just to work around the "what's the track layout" 
issue in the kernel-on-floppy direct boot. Maybe you could see it like 
a delayed bootloader process ... don't know.
But as I mentioned, it was probably just a stupid suggestion :)
