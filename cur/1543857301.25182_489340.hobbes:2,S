It is.  If good_bytes=0 then nothing is up to date and uptodate should
be set to 0.
Look at my comment before the function call:
   /* A number of bytes were successfully read. ...
I repeat again: it doesn't make sense to call scsi_end_request
with uptodate=1 and good_bytes=0, since _no bytes are uptodate_.
