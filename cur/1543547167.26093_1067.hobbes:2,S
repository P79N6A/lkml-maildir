It would be even better if all distributions made it a habit of providing the
.config that perfectly matched whatever kernel was installed.  That way, I
don't have to figure out what kind of hardware I have in order to rebuild the
kernel.
Of course, the smartest thing would be if the installation routine actually
built the kernel, with all options finely tuned to the hardware.  If I'm
installing on a single CPU system, then I don't want the SMP kernel.  Red Hat
doesn't understand that.
