Then at this juncture it makes a hell of a lot of sense for the 
vendor to release the source code for the binary driver as Open 
Source.

One thing that everyone seems to be confusing here is that 
 binary portable modules == proprietry close source drivers
This is not true, because you can just as easily have Open Source 
binary portable modules. Just because a module is binary portable 
does not instantly mean that the source code is not available. Hell, 
do you consider the pre-built kernels and libraries that come with 
Linux distributions closed source just because they are binary? Of 
course not, because the sources to build them are fully open.

That is why good design is all about. You design your API mechanism 
so that there are known extension mechanism that you can use to 
extend the existing models as necessary down the track. If the 
existing models don't work and you *really* need to change the API's 
then you end up breaking compatibility with the drivers whether they 
are source drivers or binary drivers.
Anyone designing an OS kernel is clearly interested in extensibility. 
Why do you think the Unix kernel is designed so heavily around the 
concept of files and the file system? Because that is an incredibly 
powerful metaphor for designing in future extensibility into the low 
level interfaces. You can have a /dev/mydev device that exports a 
particular API to user land apps. If the old API is really no good 
anymore, you create a /dev/mydev2 device which exports the new 
interface (and hopefully maintain a compatible interface on 
/dev/mydev). The exact same concepts can be applied to internal 
kernel interfaces that are exported to binary portable modules.

Of course. And when you figure out what type of driver bug previously 
got through the OS regression and conformance test suites (which you 
do have right?), you update the conformance tests to check for these 
conditions to ensure these problems can be effectively caught and 
fixed.

That is a ridiculous argument, similar to saying 'you cant use OS/2 
drivers on NT can you?'. Of course you can't. Windows 95 and Windows 
NT are architecturally different internally, so drivers are not 
compatible. Note that Windows 98 implements the Windows NT driver 
model (via WDM) so that all NT drivers except display drivers *can* 
be used for Windows 98. Windows 3.1 display drivers and device 
drivers on the other hand *can* be used with Windows 95, because they 
are based on the same OS technology. In fact for quite some time 
after Windows 95 was shipped, a lot of the existing device drivers 
*were* Windows 3.1 drivers.
Now what about *within* the Windows NT product line, which is a more 
valid comparision to what we are talking about here. Windows NT 3.51 
display drivers can be used on Windows NT 4.0. Windows NT 4.0 drivers 
can be used on Windows 2000. All of the above is a good thing until 
the device drivers get updated to support the new OS.
What about OS/2? The OS/2 display driver model actually allows 
drivers to be developed that work incredibly reliably between OS/2 
2.0, 2.1, 2.11, Warp 3, Warp 4 and Warp Server for e-Business. Sure 
building those drivers is a pain in the arse, but they are fully 
compatible between OS versions.

Really? That is precisely the technology that IBM licenses from us. 
They certainly consider it useful.

Eh? Since when would the hardware vendor be responsible for 
developing the interface to their device drivers? It is the 
responsibility of the OS developers to define the low level device 
driver interfaces, and then the hardware vendors implement device 
drivers for that interface.

Exactly. And *that* is the power that Open Source has. Vendors will 
open their product specifications when they realise that it is 
commercially interesting for them to do so, not because Linus and 
Alan force them to. Why would they do this? Because people such as 
yourself will specifically choose and recommend hardware that is well 
supported by vendors in an open fashion. Binary portable modules can 
just as easily be Open Source for the same reason that lots of Open 
Source XFree86 drivers not exist. Because it makes *commercial sense* 
for the hardware vendor to do this.
Remember, just because a device driver is a binary portable module 
does not mean that it is proprietry and has no source code available!
