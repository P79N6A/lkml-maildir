Granted.  Until it's modprobe xen.ko, vmware.ko, viridian.ko...that's
not going to go away, even with the VMI.

Perhaps from the syscall perspective.  But there's also things like
internal interactions with the page cache, VMA and pt updates, etc
which are much more functional/behavioural than purely moving data.
And when we're talking about page tables or simlar for hv, I think the
data vs. functional is an oversimplification.

Heheh, OK, now I know I'm lost when we've both used ACPI as a negative
example to argue our point.  Honestly, all of the above suggest no VMI
to me (in fact, I used those type of arguments against VMI about 1 year
ago ;-).

I agree that changing the interface to the low-level platform is tricky
and less isolated.  But how does the VMI protect you from those changes?
It simply doesn't, the changes are still necessary.  And the inflexibility
means the tough corner cases swept under the VMI rug are more difficult
to debug, get right, etc...
