Erm... Since then the problem had been reproduced on the patched tree, so
we apparently have something else. Behaviour on disk/quota overflow is
a separate story - even with fixes for that problem stays.

<shrug> I don't see any attempts to tag you (or ATA subsystem, for that matter)

drivers/ide/* are very unlikely to be the source of that, but information
of that kind can help to weed out some of the changes in ll_rw_blk.c.
