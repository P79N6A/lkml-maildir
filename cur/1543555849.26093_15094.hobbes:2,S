Oh, well. Some people saw the (unannounced, and not for public
consumption) pre1, so here's pre2. pre1 was just meant to be an interim
patch to sync up with the ISDN patches.
Due to the birth of my third daughter last week (yes, I got /.'ed), if you
sent me patches that aren't in pre2, you can pretty much consider them
lost.
