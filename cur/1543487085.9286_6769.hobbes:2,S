make mrproper will delete ALL generated stuff (asm -> asm-<arch> symlink,
all *.var files, etc). Sometimes make clean is not enough but make mrproper
should be ALWAYS enough to clean all possiblem "problematic" files (including
.config and such!)... Esecially for SMP<->non SMP configurations where
make clean is not enough, but make mrproper is always enough...
