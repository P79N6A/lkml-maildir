Hi to everybody,
	I would like to know if this is of some importance or not. I notedt
this meesage in the dmesg today when I tried the linux-2.6.10-rc2
kernel. 
I use a Sony Vaio PCG-GRT816S on wich I added another 512MB of ram
and a wireles Dell TrueMobile 1300 minipci card.

PCI: Using ACPI for IRQ routing
** PCI interrupts are no longer routed automatically.  If this
** causes a device to stop working, it is probably because the
** driver failed to call pci_enable_device().  As a temporary
** workaround, the "pci=routeirq" argument restores the old
** behavior.  If this argument makes the device work again,
** please email the output of "lspci" to bjorn.helgaas@hp.com
** so I can fix the driver.

Can somebody explain me what this pci routing thing is ?
Many thanks and please e-mail me as I'm not subscribed to the list.
