Going to try it out, looks like a reasonable way to go afaics.
Also, our gcc developer Ulrich Weigand found a way that
might get us rid of the duplication: We can just implement
sync read/write and rely on fallbacks or do simple wrappers
where that doesn't work out well.  Should not show much
penalty since we do sync IO immedieately (memcpy) anyway.
Suparna is right: there needs to be a 3rd way
