	Oooohhhh... Nice concept... So, if it were to implemented on
Linux would we have to bind to dentries pre-init, then? 
Or do we bind to inodes post-init? 
	Also, how would we handle overmount conditions, such as:
# mount /dev/sda3 /usr
# ls -l /usr/sbin/secureapp
-r-xr-xr-x		...		678585	secureapp
# capmap /usr/sbin/secureapp 0x4834F8483
# mount /dev/sda4 /usr/sbin
# ls -l /usr/sbin/secureapp
-r-xr-xr-x		...		998721	secureapp
	Is secureapp on /dev/sda3 the one we execute? Does secureapp on
/dev/sda4 have the capability mask we gave to old one? Neither?
