Indeed, sorry. Would you mind adding a comment that page->flags must be
accessed atomically otherwise and that __ versions are special as to
when the page cannot be referenced anymore? (its really not obvious)
Also this comments on top of page-flags.h could be updated
 * During disk I/O, PG_locked is used. This bit is set before I/O and
 * reset when I/O completes. page_waitqueue(page) is a wait queue of all tasks
 * waiting for the I/O on this page to complete.
s/PG_locked/PG_writeback/
 * Note that the referenced bit, the page->lru list_head and the active,
 * inactive_dirty and inactive_clean lists are protected by the
 * zone->lru_lock, and *NOT* by the usual PG_locked bit!
inactive_dirty and inactive_clean do not exist anymore
