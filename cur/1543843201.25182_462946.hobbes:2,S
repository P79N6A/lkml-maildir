Yes, indeed. I think we should use the _syscallX() macro, but
nevertheless I like the inline assembly example :-)
So these macros are no longer available in the latest kernel versions?
Ok, if that's true, I will use the example with the inline assembler
code and write a few lines, that these "macros" are no longer supported.
