But it has not "held up kernel development".
Send a bug report to linux-kernel or with a Cc to me and I'll look at 
the bug.
I've done this for years.

And how would a warning help?
From an UI perspective we often want to select options that have 
dependencies.

Your conclusions are based on an assumption that isn't true.
"trivial patches" are the patches you send.
But they are often bogus.
Fixing these issues properly often requires a deeper understanding of 
both kconfig and the dependencies of the underlying code.
