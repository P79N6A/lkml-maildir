The new dbench is finished (see my reply to Nathan for details).
I've done some initial runs comparing 2.6.10-rc2 and 2.6.10-rc2-mm2
and I am not seeing the performance gain with mm2 that I reported
earlier. I don't yet know if this is because I screwed up previously,
or there is some other factor that I haven't taken account of.
I'm now doing a larger set of runs comparing the two kernels with a
range of filesystems and much longer run times, plus more repeats per
run. I'm also using a script that reformats the filesystem before each
run in case that was a factor (as it was for reiser4). I'll get you
the results later today.
Cheers, Tridge
