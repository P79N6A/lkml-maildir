There were a lot of I/O-APIC & MP table parsing changes in 2.4.21
for clustered apic. Chances are something there broke on your
ancient BIOS & mobo. I can't immediately see anything obviously
broken in 2.4.21: you'll have to identify the first pre-patch where
things broke and then test or revert it piece by piece.

You didn't run that through ksymoops and post it, so how is anyone
supposed to be able to debug it?
