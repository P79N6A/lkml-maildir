Dear Alan,
The Application we are planning should not require to rebuild the kernel. 
So, I have found something like /dev/port through which I can access any port i need.
I understand this would be a best interface which will does not require any patch and I will have the complete register values I need.
Quite a GOOD one. Thanks for all your help.
You can see the attached souce code I am planning to use.
Regards,
Mukund Jampala
