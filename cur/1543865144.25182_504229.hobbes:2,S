That's what my laptop needs. Not for the wireless card, but somehow
windows locks up if I just reboot the machine. Of course no nice Oops
message or so.

Most certainly, the plans are there for quite some time, but...

... the documentation isn't. Right now the only available documentation
comes from reverse engineering. It's actually rather amazing that the
authors came this far, no vendor documentation yet still a lot of
supported cards.

That's my take as well. They already lost us on the Gig ethernet cards.
A couple of years ago we considered Broadcom based cards, but given the
lack of vendor driver support, we got Intel E1000 based cards instead.
We also considered NatSemi gigE cards, but the Intels were much faster.
Right now we use about 15 E1000's with probably more to come (they go
in every new machine). Not a high figure but still a lost sale for
Broadcom.
As for wireless, for personal use I needed a wireless PCMCIA/CardBus
card and a Linksys bcm4318 based card was the only reasonably supported
card I could get. It works but still has its peculiarities.
