OK - Thanks for the Info.
For the moment, the machine in question will be simply running as a SAMBA 
Server, and then only for one or two clients at a time (it's storing disk 
images from PowerQuest's Drive Image Pro Software), and it (so far) seems to 
be stable enough when data is coming in from the network.
If there is any detailed info. I can give you from the system, I'll be happy 
to pop them over to you - similarly, if I can help test any revised versions 
in the future, I'd be happy to do so.
Thanks again... :)
