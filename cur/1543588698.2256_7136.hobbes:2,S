Just got interesting, lets let the world look in.
What did you have in mind here?  I suspect that on some archs the cycle
counter is not available to user code.  I know that on parisc it is
optionally available (kernel can set a bit to make it available), but by
it self it is only good for intervals.  You need to peg some value to a
CLOCK to use it to get timeofday, for instance.
On the other hand, if there is an area of memory that both users and
system can read but only system can write, one might put the soft clock
there.  This would allow gettimeofday (with the cycle counter) to work
without a system call.  To the best of my knowledge the system does not
have such an area as yet.
comments?
