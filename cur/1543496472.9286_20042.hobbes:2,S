I remember looking at that exact line, too, but I didn't notice the
error.  Unfortunately, my userland prog still detects time decrements
in the 1-10ms range, frequently (but not always) accompanied by
recover_lost_timer messages in the log.
This is frustrating: you'd think that more people would have noticed
this, but some people with SMP machines tried my program and nobody
reported any time warps.  Maybe something's screwy with my hardware?
I don't have anything really weird; just 4 IDE disks (2xHD, CD, and
CD-R), an IDE Zip drive on my sound card (SB ISA-PnP), ATI-PCI video,
and PS/2 and USB mice.
Looking at time.c now, I wonder if I've screwed up your patch
somehow.  At line 484, I have:
		/* read Pentium cycle counter */
		rdtscl(last_tsc_low);
		__asm__ __volatile__("rdtsc" : "=a" (last_tsc_low) : : "edx");
Don't those two lines do the same thing?  (I noticed that you changed
from explicit __asm__ statements to macros/inlines on some of the MSR
and I/O statements...did you forget to remove the second statement in
this case, or did I mis-apply the patch?)

d.
