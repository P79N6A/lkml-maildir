The patch forwarded below still applies against 2.6.10-rc1-mm2.
Was there any specific reason why it wasn't applied?

Subject: [PATCH] uninline __sigqueue_alloc
Christoph suggests letting the compiler choose.  No real compelling reason
to inline anyhow.  I had some vmlinux size numbers suggesting inline was
better, but re-running them on newer kernel is giving different results,
favoring uninline.  Best let compiler choose.  Un-inline __sigqueue_alloc.
