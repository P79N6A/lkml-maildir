Unportable? It's at least as portable as u32 is, surely? We probably
wouldn't have used <stdint.h> in the kernel anyway -- we define them
ourselves. 
The header files are completely irrelevant too -- we're talking about
'u32' not '__u32'.
The important thing is your belief that it's ugly, which is what was
documented.

When describing the CodingStyle rules "thou shalt not use typedefs" we
do need to list the exceptions, and that includes 'u32' et al.
Yes, those _are_ acceptable in the kernel. That's what the document
_says_. It _doesn't_ say that they're not.
