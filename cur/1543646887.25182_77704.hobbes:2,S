Well, you are right - the kernel support for winmodem is good if one wants
to use ppp et al. On the other hand, it seems that having support for some
specialised protocol can produce a lot of overhead in some cases. For
example, I once owned very simple Zoltrix, that could do error correction
and compression only via the software driver (available only for windows, 
of course). So, it was almost unusable until I started doing ppp on it.
The ppp driver took care about errors and compression - now, with the same
futures implemented in lower layers it would be a waste of cpu.
So, if you want to do kernel support for winmodem, it would be probably
good to remember about ppp. Of course, if you choose to implement full
support and emulate v34 or anything else, you would be able to turn the
compression (and || or) error correction off either on the emulated
'modem' or in ppp options.
Anyway, I think you could have a look at www.linmodems.org. It seems to
contain some interesting things.
