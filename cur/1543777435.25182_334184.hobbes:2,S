No. It can have a local drift, but the point is, the error never gets 
worse - it _stays_ local.
There's no point in polling twice in immediate succession just because a 
sleep overslept. That's like a security guard testing each door twice for 
being locked, just because he overslept one round. Pointless.
But what matters is that you don't let your local errors accumulate into 
the big picture.
Now, if somebody wants to make nicer helper functions so that you can say
	timeout = ms_from_now(500);
or something instead of saying "timeout = jiffies + HZ/2", then hey, go 
wild. At that point it's just syntactic sugar, and maybe it's worth it.
