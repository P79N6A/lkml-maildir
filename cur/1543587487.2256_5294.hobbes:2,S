We're looking at making a set of security checkers.  Does anyone have
suggestions for good things to go after in addition to the usual
copy_*_user and buffer overrun bugs?  For example, are there any
documents that describe the rules for when/how 'capable' is supposed to
be used?
Thanks for any help,
Dawson
