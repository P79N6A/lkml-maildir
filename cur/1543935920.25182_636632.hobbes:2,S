At page 4-3 of  ADSP-BF54x Blackfin(R) Processor Peripheral Hardware
Reference, there is a table which guide us the SDH controller does not
support 4-bit mode MMC card. Please found the table picture in the
attachment or get the document at:

I am sorry for this mistake. This tracker is not for this 4-bit issue,
it is another bug which should be fixed by Cliff.

Thanks, actually we are not yet convinced  by our hardware designer
why BF54x SDH does not support 4-bit MMC.
