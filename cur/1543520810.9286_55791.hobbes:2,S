Subject: kernel doesn't see a driver right, and lilo truncates append= line?

A friend of mine has a box with 2 40Gid IDE drives on a promise IDE 
controller.  Apparently it's not see'ing the geometry correctly.  When
he specifies the geometry with an "append=" line, it truncates around
40chars.  he's currently running 2.2.14-pre-patch-17.
Thoughts?  I'm looking forward to the mirrors he's going to run...
