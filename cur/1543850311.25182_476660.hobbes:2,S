You have to remember there are two filesystem layers involved.  NFS or other
netfs does the DAC, MAC, whatever checks to see whether the user can access a
file.  NFS then asks the cache to back the netfs file and the cache creates a
file in the local filesystem to do that.
The cache file doesn't need the DAC/MAC/whatever attributes applied to the
netfs file, and, in fact, may not be able to support what the netfs deals
with.

You're forgetting that the userspace cache manager daemon still has to access
the cache.

I'm not sure exactly.  Actually, I could probably deal with read/write ops
inline - though I don't have a file struct to carry a security context - but
getting and releasing inodes would certainly wind up being farmed off.
Consider the automounter releasing an NFS share that's been heavily used...

That's fine by me, though I want the security on a cache file to be different
to that on the netfs file it's backing.
