Paul, can you please comment on 2/2 patch instead. 1/2 is just a resend of the
Peter's original patch that I was building on top. So yes it predates that
discussion. I used it as the baseline.

There are more comments in 2/2. There is one spot in there where I'm not sure
about the locking (look for FIXME comment). Everything else seems to be
protected correctly by callback_lock. I may have missed things of course.

Please take a look at
	[PATCH 2/2] cpusets: Improved irq affinity handling
I'm treating irqs just like tasks (at least I think I'm :).
