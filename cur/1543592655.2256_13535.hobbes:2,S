But the claim was that 2.4.5-ac2 is faster than 2.4.5 plain, so which
changes are in 2.4.5-ac2 that would make it faster than 2.4.5 plain? Also, I
don't know if 2.4.5-ac1 is as fast as 2.4.5-ac2 for Fabio. If not, then it's
a change in the 2.4.5-ac2 changelog. If it is as fast, it is one of the
changes in the 2.4.5-ac1 changelog.
I haven't tried plain kernels for a long time, but 2.4.5-ac1 is definately a
lot slower for interactive use than 2.4.4-ac8 so I've gone back to using
that version. I haven't tried 2.4.5-ac2 to see if that improves upon -ac1.
The VM in 2.4.5 might be largely 'fixed' and I know that the VM changes in
-ac were considered to be but still broken, however for me they worked
better than what is in 2.4.5.
I have a rather aging P5MMX at 200MHz with 64MB RAM, and I'm only judging
interactive use (not measuring anything like compile times etc).
with greetings,
