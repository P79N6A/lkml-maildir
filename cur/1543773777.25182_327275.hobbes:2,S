Cool. Just once comment:

How about separating all this ifdef code into a separate debug patch on top
of the amd_76x_pm patch? Or just leave it out as I don't think anybody is
using it. It would shrink down the patch quite a bit and make it more
readable.
I won't be able to access my dual athlon box until September, so I'm not
much of help with this module :)
Regards,
Tony
