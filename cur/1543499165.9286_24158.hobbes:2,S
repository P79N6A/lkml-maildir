It seems something isn't right with MTRR support for the K6-2,
I have a K6-2 450, running 2.2.10.
When I boot, there is a /proc/mtrr, but it is empty.
When I 
echo "base=0xe8000000 size=0x10000000 type=write-combining" >| /proc/mtrr
the file remains empty.
If I write a random string to /proc/mtrr, the kernel will complain, so
I am pretty sure I've got everything setup right.
I've also noticed a few other messages of people reporting the same problem.
Any advice or assistance would be much appreciated.
Thanks,
Mike McLinn
