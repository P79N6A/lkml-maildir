Jeff Law played with a similar optimization about 1-2 years ago, and eventually
deleted all of the code because there were problems with the code.  It would
help some of our platforms (but not the x86) to access all variables in the
same section via a common pointer.  This is because on those systems, it often
times takes 2-3 instructions to access global/static variables.  Global
variables you have more problems visiblity and such.
