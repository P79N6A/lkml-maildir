I've already responded to this post, but this particular line struck
me as particularly ridiculous.
This person is here telling me what the UNIX philosophy is, which is
not only insulting, but also came completely out of the blue.
Yet they seemed to have missed the fundamental concept of UNIX: that
everything wants to be a file, and that a file is a bag of bytes.
This concept of UNIX runs even deeper than the toolkit philosophy (a
philosophy that was documented many years after UNIX was born).
So it seems that some fundamental concepts of UNIX should be ignored
when convenient to do so, like files being bags of bytes, but if you
want to insult the people disagreeing with you or imply that they're
not as "UNIX savvy" as you, simply explain the "UNIX philosophy" (in
condescending tones) and then loudly yell that they're Windows users
in disguise (possibly in the hope that nobody would seriously listen
to their arguments after that).

See, I'm a prophet :-/
