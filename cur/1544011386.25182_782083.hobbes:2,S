btw., there's a recent commit:
  32a7600: printk: make printk more robust by not allowing recursion
since then printk shouldnt deadlock anymore, even if called from within 
the scheduler.
Btw., ftrace_printk() can be used similarly (and you can capture it 
nonstop via /debug/tracing/trace_pipe), and should not deadlock either.
