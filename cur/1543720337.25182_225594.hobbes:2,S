Fair enough. It's sometimes easier to just register the driver irq early, 
though, to take care of all the cases that can happen. In particular, if 
you know you may have pending interrupts, and your irq handler is good at 
clearing them (it had better be), the easiest solution may well be to just 
register early.

Now _this_ will help. However, I suspect it will help three years down the
line, not now. It should have been there originally, it would have solved 
a lot of problems.
