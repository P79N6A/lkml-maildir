I think that sounds like a fairly good approach.
Software obviously can make the "rough" selections, it's the fine-grained 
ones that are harder (and might need to be done at a frequency that just 
makes it impractical).
So yes, having software say "We want to steer this particular interrupt to 
this L3 cache domain" sounds eminently sane.
Having software specify which L1 cache domain it wants to pollute is 
likely just crazy micro-management.
