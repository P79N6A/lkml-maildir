It All Depends :)
imagine a big scary multi bussed machine where the packet was being
read/written to be copy/csumed and then dmaed from a card that is local to
that remote memory..  someone get dave a ss2000 with lots of system boards
and hmes..
I'm willing to bet that my bebox with its mind numbing cpu power will be
quite happy to let the 905b do the csuming for it :)
*shrug* :)
