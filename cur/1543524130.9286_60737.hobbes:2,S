We _can't_ do complete umount. init and libc alone will not let us do it
(come to think of that, umount(8) may be a problem too ;-).
ObInvalidatingStuff: it's not as bad as it sounds. Once we go for
pagecache on devices we will be in much better position:
	a) dropping the pages will be needed on BDEV_FILE -> BDEV_FS.
Not too often thing, aside of fsck/mount. And mount after fsck really
should not bother much with metadata - I agree with you here.
	b) the only case when we need to flush buffers will be umount().
Notice that it affects only metadata - data is in page cache, so until it
is not flushed we can't drop inodes, thus can't umount.
	c) BDEV_FILE -> BDEV_FILE is not a problem - no invalidation is
needed. However, we can't destroy block_device until all pages are gone.
BFD - memory pressure will get rid of them. All we need is
shrink_bdcache() that would go through the list of block_devices with
bd_count==0 and drop those who have no pages. Notice that dissociating
the block_device from driver still can be done on blkdev_put() - no harm
will be done. That takes care of floppy and friends.
