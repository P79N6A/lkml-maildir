   Thats an API video overlay really really needs of course - because DMA from
   the capture card into the video memory is precisely how its done.
Ok, then it is important to figure out if there is going to be a
suitable way to get at the two pci_dev's.
If mmap()'ing the frame buffer and passing this into read() is how
this will be done, it simply won't work.  That's the point I'm trying
to make.
