I disagree. With this option you get silent corruption, without you get
noisy corruption. And I would always prefer the latter, even if it
increases the risk of it happening.

This is a general problem for all removable/hotpluggable storage. So
sticking it in the MMC block device would be the wrong layer IMO.
Until the filesystems can be made to store something sane on disk
before the suspend, I'd say this is best handled in user space. Let the
user space tools refuse to initiate the suspend as long as any
removable devices are mounted.

Doesn't mean we shouldn't do it. And if we keep papering over the
problems, you reduce the motivation of fixing this properly.
