I have been using the NMS cards under Linux and have been developing for
them under Linux for a good 54-5 months now.  NMS have done a straight
port of their unix/nt driver and have used LiS (Linux Streams).  Pika I
believe have done the same kind of thing and just ported their unix
drivers across.  Dialogic supposedly have done the same.
Noone has done anything radical, apart from NMS open sourcing their
drivers and the core of their really good CT Access program.
I woudl love a strong "common" framework to be pushed by ourselves, and
with open sourced drivers, we can possibly implementthe drivers with this
framework.  However it would be hard to convince these manufacturers that
using our framework is a better idea than their "recompile" port, as I
guess what is very different about these manufacturers are that they have
developed cross platform drivers already from the need of supporting
Unixware, Solaris and NT, their development API's are also very tied down
to how the drivers present themselves.
I am all for helping create such a framework, and it is about time someone
united the APIs at this kinda level.  It would make Linux a better
environment for CTI development.
