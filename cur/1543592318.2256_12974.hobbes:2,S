NTFS is not a good example for a 2.4.x file system at the moment IMHO. It 
doesn't even use the page cache at all...
But anyway, I recompile the whole kernel the first time round, i.e. say I 
install the latest kernel, apply my latest NTFS patch, copy my old .config 
to linux/.config, make oldconfig. Then I set off: make dep && make bzImage 
&& make modules && sudo make modules_install [switch to different VT and do 
other stuff, go out, have dinner, whatever...], then install kernel, lilo, 
reboot.
Once I am running the new kernel, it becomes much easier: modify some code 
in linux/fs/ntfs, then from linux/ I just do: make modules && make 
modules_install && rmmod ntfs && modprobe ntfs and the new driver is loaded...
If I change any code outside of fs/ntfs then a new make bzImage, etc is 
required, as I build everything static (only ntfs as a module).
If I install a new kernel as I do quite frequently to keep up on what's 
going on, a new kernel compile is required from scratch...
Hope this helps.
Anton
