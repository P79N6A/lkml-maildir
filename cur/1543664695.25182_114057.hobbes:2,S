If that's the only concern left, I guess its time for us to go 
back and complete what we have (we still have a few issues to
think over and concentrate on fixing), look at Nigel's patches 
more closely, and then come back and discuss the algo sometime 
later .. You could make up your mind about the actual complexity 
then (both for suspend and resume paths). 
From what I can gather from this whole discussion, it seems 
worth at least a detailed look on our part. 
Thanks for the inputs and insights.
