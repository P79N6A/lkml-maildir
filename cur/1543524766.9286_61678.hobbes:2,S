It's still BIOS problem though :-/ I've seen this.

You should create partition table there to span the entire disk. If BIOS is
broken then you can sometimes do it with Windows9X's FDISK and/or Partition
Magic. When you have correct partition table Linux will be able to use full
capacity of disk without any troubles even if you have broken BIOS.

No.

Never seen this program :-)

It's common problem: you BIOS is "good enough" for Windows9X but not "good
enough" for Linux :-(( Since Linux will not use BIOS when there are exist
correct parttion table on disk you can just plug disk in some "normal" system
and partition it (BTW why I've seen LOTS of such problems with IBM,
Dell and other brands but NEVER see such problems with
make-it-yourself-from-cheneese-components systems? Hmm. All such system use
Award BIOS typically while brands are using it's own BIOS... Hmm).
