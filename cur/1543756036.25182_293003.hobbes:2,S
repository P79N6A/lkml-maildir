In MythTV I switched between cards ('Y'). When I switched out of
a DVB card into the analog card I got no signal.
The system started responding slowly (long pauses) and after a
while it locked up.
Attached in the serial line log of the session, including SysRq
task dump.
I should say that I noticed similar system loss of response earlier
(while running -rc2) without a full lockup, and then decided to
reboot (-rc3). Suspecting the video system, I tested all three
tuners (2 DVB and one analog) and got the pauses, then finally
the lockup after about a minute (or less). The log for this
session is attached.
My feeling is that the analog tuner has a real problem (either
a bug of just not enough signal) which is tolerated for a while
but soon the kernel fails.
