Yes Mike's patches are definitely better. My patches are designed for the 
2.4-ck patchset which has other workarounds that augment this patch; however 
these workarounds are harder to stomach for mainstream kernels (read nasty 
hacks). I thought I'd offer the not so nasty sleep_decay patch in 2.5 form 
for perusal and comments since people are more willing to test 2.5 patches.
