Yes. However, what worries me more is that there are people who have the 
hardware, but because the driver won't even compile for them, they just go 
"oh, well, I'll try it again when the _real_ 2.6.0 hits the streets".
Which obviously won't work.
So I'm trying to make sure that all the broken drivers are gotten to a 
working state. Right now, considering how long they've been broken, that 
means "it must compile" so that people can test them. 
The "leave it broken, so that somebody will fix it properly some day" 
approach is a fine one for early development series. But right now I'd 
prefer to see patches to make drivers compile cleanly, even if people 
can't test them on real hardware.
The intersection of people who have the hardware, and people who have the 
time/knowledge to convert a driver, may be empty. Expecially for odd 
hardware. So let's get those drivers compiling, even if we can't test 
them, so that others _can_ test them.
