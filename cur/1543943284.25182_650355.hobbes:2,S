Syncing is initiated by kexec-tools. Following is the code in
kexec/kexec.c in kexec-tools-testing.tar.gz
        if ((result == 0) && do_sync) {
                sync();
I think this problem has nothing to do with syncing. There seems to be
some dependency on not shutting down network here. You might want to 
debug, exactly where does it get stuck.
- Specify earlyprintk= parameter for second kernel and see if control
  is reaching to second kernel.
- Otherwise specify --console-serial parameter on "kexec -l" commandline
  and it should display a message "I am in purgatory" on serial console.
  This will just mean that control has reached at least till purgatory.
Right now  there does not seem to be any option to prevent syncing and 
I don't know why would one like to have one.

I have no idea. This might be an stale comment. Try putting -x before -e.

Even if you did -f, it must have shutdown the network. I think somehow
in latest kernels there is some dependency on network and that's why
not shutting down network in this case is helping you.
