Bugger.  OK.
And I don't see quite how the global flag is causing the BUG bug in 
change_page_attr().  The logic is:
	if (pgprot_val(prot) != pgprot_val(ref_prot)) {
		...
	} else {
		if (!pte_huge(*kpte)) {
			...
		} else
			BUG();
	}
Is _PAGE_GLOBAL causing the first if() to fall through to the second 
clause?  Because otherwise it shouldn't have any effect on the 
pte_huge() test.
But given that ref_prot is set to PAGE_KERNEL or PAGE_KERNEL_EXEC, which 
will have _PAGE_GLOBAL in it either way, I don't see where the problem 
is coming from.
Gah!  This can't be right!  I think the original change_page_attr() code 
is plain buggy.
The crash call chain is:
  [<ffffffff8021db68>] change_page_attr_addr+0x9e/0x119
  [<ffffffff8021d44f>] ioremap_change_attr+0x49/0x58
  [<ffffffff8021d626>] iounmap+0xbe/0xe0
...
ioremap_change_attr does:
		err = change_page_attr_addr(vaddr,npages,__pgprot(__PAGE_KERNEL|flags));
Now, in the current code (ie, before my patch), __PAGE_KERNEL doesn't 
have _PAGE_GLOBAL set, but PAGE_KERNEL does.  Therefore, 
change_page_attr_addr calls
	__change_page_attr(address, pfn, prot, PAGE_KERNEL);
which means:
	__change_page_attr(address, pfn, pgprot(__PAGE_KERNEL), PAGE_KERNEL);
(iounmap always passes flags of 0) which just happens to fail the test:
	if (pgprot_val(prot) != pgprot_val(ref_prot)) {
because prot doesn't contain _PAGE_GLOBAL and ref_prot does.
In other words, prot and ref_prot can never be equal, so this path is 
always taken, and the other branch which tests pte_huge() is never run.
Andi?  Jan?  Is this code just buggy, or is there something else going 
on here?
