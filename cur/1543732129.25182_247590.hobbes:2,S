The multiple steps are needed, otherwise there can be problems
with hyperthreading (the first x86-64 didn't do it in all cases,
and it causes occassional problens with Intel CPUs) 
Also repeated calls of this are relatively cheap because at the
second time there is not much to flush anymore.
I would suggest to not do this change, it could cause very
subtle problems.
