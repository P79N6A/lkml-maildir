Good, so it shall be then :-)
A related question. get_user_pages() does page_cache_get() on the page,
except if it's reserved. First question is 'why' doesn't it do that on a
reserved page? We get this conditional when mapping, and the unmapping
needs to check for reserved as well before doing page_cache_release().
Surely the extra reference would be ok to hold for PageReserved pages
as well?
And it not, there's a bug if get_user_pages() fails:
	if (!PageReserved(pages[i]))
		page_cache_get(pages[i]);
and if we ever fail:
	while (i--)
		page_cache_release(pages[i]);
