ioremap_resource() looks like a fine idea.  It's cleaner, easily
emulateable on <= 2.4 and solves the problem this hack wanted to
work around properly.
This still doesn't make the phys_addr_t a good interims solution,
though.  Just use ioremap_resource from the beginning for those
drivers that care for the bigger address space on ppc44x.
Paul, what does actually use this higher addresses?
