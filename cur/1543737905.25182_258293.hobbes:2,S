I think that this is becoming overly complicated.  I think that you need 
(at most) two types of cpuset: 1. the top level non overlapping type and 
2. possibly overlapping sets within the top level ones. I think that the 
term cpuset should be reserved for the top level ones and some other 
term be coined for the others.  The type 2 ones are really just the 
equivalent of the current affinity mask but with the added constraint 
that it be a (non empty) proper subset of the containing cpuset.
The three types that you've described are then just examples of 
configurations that could be achieved using this model.
