Subject: [PATCH] ppc: eliminate gcc warning in prom.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch shuts up a couple of gcc "variable may be used
uninitialized" warnings.  The warnings are invalid - the code is such
that the variables are in fact initialized before being used - but gcc
isn't smart enough to see that.  This patch eliminates the warnings.
