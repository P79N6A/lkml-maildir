Unfortunately it seems that setterm's powersaving (DPMS) capabilities depend 
an APM support in the kernel and are therefore unavailable on the x86_64 
architecture.
This shortcoming may have seemed unimportant when Opteron started in the 
server segment but there is a growing number of AMD Turion mobiles that could 
greatly benefit from this feature.
I wonder how difficult it would be, to port APM to the x86_64 architecture or 
to provide DPMS support in the FBDev drivers.
