Since i386 was switched to the generic-IRQ architecture (see "Linux
generic IRQ handling" in Documentation/Docbook) it does not use __do_IRQ().
common_interrupt (in assembler) calls do_IRQ(), which calls
desc->handle_irq() that is usually one of:
 handle_fasteoi_irq()
 handle_level_irq()
 handle_edge_irq()
