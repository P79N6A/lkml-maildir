The mdacon.c in 2.4.18 does not actually test for an MDA card, it only
test for ram where the MDA vram is. The problem is that almost any vga
card maps ram to that address.
There is a test, but it is somewhat wrong (it changes registers, but
does not save and restore the original values) and is commented out. If
you fix this and uncomment the test, it works in some cases (this was
discussed under the subject "MDA video detection request" on July 2000).
