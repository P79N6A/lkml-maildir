The problem definately occurs on 2.4.20-19.8
B> I saw that on VIA KT266 k2.6.0-test5 and it
seems to go away if I use anticipatory scheduling
instead of deadline scheduling in kernel config and
don't use aggressive mem settings in cmos, and USB
on a server what's that for?
Did you flash all your bioses before trying anything?
I saw acpi-derivative problems go away after flashing
an award bios on another server. It seems there was
no graceful fail or default when acpi id info is not
in bios, so improvement was drastic. ACPI problems
cause USB to go clunk when ide is active, and downstream
conflicts like that are not too informative or productive
to look at if flashing the bios would "fix the code" as
if by magic.
