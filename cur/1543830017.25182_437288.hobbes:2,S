Everyone should keep in mind that eventually, the ACPICA code can be
fully integrated into each host operating system and then maintained by
the individual OS projects.
During the time that Intel is actively developing and supporting the
ACPICA code, we need the OS-independent interfaces to provide
portability across the dozen or so host operating systems that are
currently supported.
Yes, of course there is some inefficiency in not using the native OS
interfaces. However, this is really the only sane way to support so many
different hosts, and all OS projects get the benefit of debugging help
and feedback from the many different operating systems.
