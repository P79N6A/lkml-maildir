Subject: [PATCH]: Correctly locate RSDP in EBDA
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

ACPI spec. states that the location of the RSDP structure is found by searching
* The first 1 KB of the Extended BIOS Data Area (EBDA).
* The BIOS read-only memory space between 0E0000h and 0FFFFFh
The EBDA scan looks wrong. The patch below against 2.6.12 should correct this.
-Udo.

Calculate correct EBDA address for ACPI RSDP scan. The word at BIOS Data Area
40:0E is the segment address of the EBDA.
