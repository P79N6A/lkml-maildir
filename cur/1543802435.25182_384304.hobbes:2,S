No, I meant -F (a capical F), which means to force to set up the
controls even the number id mismatches.  This avoid the errors like
above.  (The default behavior of alsactl is a bit too strict.)
But, anyway, it's better to do the following:
- Boot with PnP ON, run "alsactl -f state-with-pnp store"
- Boot with PnP OFF, run "alsactl -f state-wo-pnp store"
then compare these two files.
