Hi Wu,
It is not very clear to me what is the meaning of these numbers and what
you're trying to deduce from them. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
z->aging_total is the sum of all scanned inactive pages for the zone
(sum of scanned pages by shrink_cache).
z->aging_milestone is the number of pages scanned with "nr_inactive"
precision (it is updated in response to a full inactive list scan).
z->page_age is the difference between aging_milestone and aging_total.
The name sounds a bit misleading since "page age" intuitively means
"what is the age of a page".
Anyway, z->page_age is the number of scanned pages since the last full  
scan, shifted left by PAGE_AGE_SHIFT and divided by the number of       
inactive pages.                                                         
IOW, it still means "number of scanned pages since last full scan".
How can that be meaningful? No other code uses this in the patchset
AFAICS.
