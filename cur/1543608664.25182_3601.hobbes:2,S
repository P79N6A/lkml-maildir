As I said, this is a very rough cut. I'm not actually suggesting this
is code people should run (although testing reports are always
welcome), it's a release so that people can see what I'm doing.

Surprising as it may seem, I agree with Al. The old code has too many
problems, and can't be fixed with just a tweak here and there. A
re-write is what is needed, and a re-write is what I'm doing. The new
code will be tested, and once I'm satisfied that it works at least as
well as the old code, I'll submit it to Linus. Any remaining problems
should be much easier to fix in the new code, I hope.
