Sorry I'm a little late replying to this...
Actually this patch makes raw notifiers behave a little _less_ like the
original pre-2.6.17 notifiers.  With the original code, a notifier callout
routine could unregister itself and deallocate its notifier_block, thereby
causing an oops when it returned.  With this patch, the oops will not
occur.
That's the only difference.
