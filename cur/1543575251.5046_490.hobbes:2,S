Hi.
(Does anyone know the maintainer of this code?)
When compiling drivers/net/rclanmtl.c (240t12p3) I get a warning about
incompatible pointer assignment. As far as I can tell it has appeared
because PU32 has been changed to __u32* since test9 (where it was an
unsigned long*). The following patch fixes this by changing the
offending lvalue to a PU32 instead of an unsigned long*, which is
my unqualified guess at a fix.
