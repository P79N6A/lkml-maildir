Subject: [BUG] ATA over Ethernet __init calling __exit

static void __exit
aoe_exit(void)
{
...
}
static int __init
aoe_init(void)
{
...
                        aoe_exit();
...
}
Enough said, please shoot the author of that in the foot.  You can't
call functions marked __exit (which may be discarded) from functions
which aren't.  If you want to do this, please loose the __exit on
aoe_exit().
In addition, please shoot the author in the other foot for:
config ATA_OVER_ETH
        tristate "ATA over Ethernet support"
        depends on NET
        default m               <==== this line.
That's not nice for embedded guys who do a "make xxx_defconfig" and
unsuspectingly end up with ATA over Ethernet built in for their
platform.
