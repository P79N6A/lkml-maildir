Subject: sync-Regression in 2.6.28.2?

I recently installed 2.6.28.2 on our postfix/dovecot-based
mailboxserver. Previously, 2.6.28 and 2.6.28.1 have been running there
without a hitch.
Now with 2.6.28.2 I had two major lockups: All writes to the users'
Maildirs (on ext4) would stall, the load would rise, "sync" would never
return.
I had to "reboot -f -n" to get the machine back. All hanging processes
were unkillable, even with kill -9.
There was NOTHING in dmesg, nothing in the log either. No indication
of filesystem errors or anything.
Lookin at the
http://www.eu.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ChangeLog-2.6.28.2
I see changes to 
fs: sys_sync fix
fs: sync_sb_inodes fix
fs: remove WB_SYNC_HOLD
Since the mailserver uses sync() extensively (both dovecot and
postfix), maybe that's the culprit?
Note: I'm really just guessing here!
Back to 2.6.28.1 for now.
