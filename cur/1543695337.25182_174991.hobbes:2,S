OK, I will put that patch in.
Thanks!  
(and hmmm... maybe it _is_ time to upgrade gcc.  Looking at the
problems with long long unsigneds, that looks awfully familiar with a
mailfiltering app I am coding that got GCC very wierded out.  I
thought it was just my l33t ex-FORTRAN-hack coding style that was the
bug cause.  :-) ).
What's the recommended version of GCC these days?
