looks fine to me. It somewhat reduces the utility of copy_process()
[which we primarily introduced to enable wakeup-less SMP bootstrapping],
but i cannot see any good solution besides moving copy_thread() out of
copy_process(), which is unsafe. (ptrace could potentially access the
new task before copy_thread() is done, etc.) So i'd go for the simple
solution of CLONE_IDLETASK not doing a wakeup.
