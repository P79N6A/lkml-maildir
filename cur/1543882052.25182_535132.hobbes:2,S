And even if you can (and you can't always, because the anti-frag is
only heuristics), then it costs you complexity and overhead to do.

Anyway, this is a general large block size issue, and not specifically
anything to do with large pagecache size.

Yeah. IMO anti-fragmentation and defragmentation is the hack, and we
should stay away from higher order allocations whenever possible.
Hardware is built to handle many small pages efficintly, and I don't
understand how it could be an SGI-only issue. Sure, you may have an
order of magnitude or more memory than anyone else, but even my lowly
desktop _already_ has orders of magnitude more pages than it has TLB
entries or cache -- if a workload is cache-nice for me, it probably
will be on a 1TB machine as well, and if it is bad for the 1TB machine,
it is also bad on mine.
If this is instead an issue of io path or reclaim efficiency, then it
would be really nice to see numbers... but I don't think making these
fundamental paths more complex and slower is a nice way to fix it
(larger PAGE_SIZE would be, though).
