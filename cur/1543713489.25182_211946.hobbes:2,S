sounds good, probably a preempt bug in the alsa code or an rcu issue or
something like that. my tree has the most important fixes in the
writeback code from Takashi to provide the same lowlatency w/ or w/o
CONFIG_PREEMPT so you shouldn't notice much difference either ways. It
was a good decision to leave preempt off for higher reliability too,
preempt isn't just a matter of spinlocks, sometime you need explicit
preempt_disable to make it work right.
still it'd be nice to fix it purerly as an exercise, exercises are
useful nevertheless ;).
