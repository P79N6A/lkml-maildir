Subject: [PATCH] fix 2.4.0-test12 scsi makefile
X-Mailer: Mutt 1.0i
Hi Linus,
this patch makes scsi usable not in the common case where scsi itself
is built into the kernel and some drivers are modules - the patch in
2.4.0-test12 made it work for modules only on parisc64 - now it
should work everywhere.
The comment in the patch explains how it works.
Please apply.
	Christoph

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
