My mistake, I was looking at the ouput of my "char x;" example,
which IMHO is even worse.
covell@xxxxxxx ~>cat foo.c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
        char x;
        if ( x )
        {
                printf ("\n We got here\n");
        }
        else
        {
                // We never get here
                printf ("\n We never got here\n");
        }
        exit (0);
}
covell@xxxxxx ~>gcc -Wall foo.c
foo.c: In function `main':
foo.c:17: warning: implicit declaration of function `exit'
