On most chips, you need to tweak both the 0x92 port and the keyboard
controller if you want to disable A20.  There are some funny latencies
going on, too, since this is usually in external logic.
The source code to SYSLINUX contains A20 enable/disable code.  Beyond
this I suggest taking this to comp.lang.asm.x86.
