[I know it already got merged, I'm behind on mail, but anyway...]
Could board-specific quirks like this please always include a
check for that board?  Or, even better, do a fixup in the
bootwrapper.
In this case the workaround won't likely trigger on the wrong
boards, but "just a little bit" more dangerous workarounds
_will_, and the law of big numbers works against us...
