Sorry to say this. But the fs loopback is not fixed, or this some other bug fixed but than i
have shown before.
This an example. This kills my 2.4.0test5 system, an Intel PII SMP box. Im out of the office
so I
can only verfiy that i still exist on my machine.
This work is 2.2.14, but test[2-5] systems stops running without
any messages.
Create an big image.
dd if=/dev/zero of=/someware/dosfs.img bs=64k count=10000
Create an msdos filesystem on the image.  (Im using dosfstools-2.4)
I have also done this with ext2 and get the same results.
msdosfs /somewhere/dosfs.img
Mount it.
mount -o loop /somewhere/dosfs.img /mnt/mymountpoint
Do the bad thing...
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/mymountpoint/bigfile.foo bs=64k
Wait....
After a while the system can not create process and dies.
A difference with 2.4.0test4 is that the filesystem is less corrupted with test5. And sync
command
not complete during the dd on the loopback device.
