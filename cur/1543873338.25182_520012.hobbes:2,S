Hi,
Our driver is not in the kernel tree yet.
The code snippet from poll entry point is as follows:
    mask = 0;
    poll_wait(filp, &(sap_desc->recv_any_wq), poll_table);
    /* We don't have yet a waiting queue for writers... */
    lock_mts();
    if ((sap_desc->recv_q.first != NULL) &&
        (block_ssync_event(sap_desc->recv_q.first) == FALSE)) {
        /* The queue can be read. */
        mask |= POLLIN | POLLRDNORM;
    }
    unlock_mts();
    //MTS_HOOK(mts_syscall_exit,__FUNCTION__,mask);
    return mask; 
The wake_up_interruptible(&(sap_desc->recv_any_wq)) is executed
from the sending process.
Hope this is sufficient. As I mentioned in my previous mail, what I
am trying to understand better is the kernel code path of do_select() 
versus wake_up_interruptible.
Thanks,
Ravi

you forgot to include your (full) sourcecode or a pointer to that...
