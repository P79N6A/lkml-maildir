No! Then you can't make a tool that will be able to look at
the entire x86 address-space! You end up with an offset that will
eventually wrap to zero which you are denying. You must leave
MAP_FIXED alone. Ignore the 'C' pedants, a pointer is properly
initialized if it points to a mapped address. It would be absurd
to have to make the CPU calculate the address at run-time just
because you thew some rocks in the way.
