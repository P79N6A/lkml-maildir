In add_entropy_words of random.c my experimental code is calling
crypto_digest_update().  In update() it calles crypto_yield.
add_entropy_words() is being call ed directly from a keyboard_interrupt.  I
was hoping to tidy up the code a bit by not using batch_entropy_stores... but
I guess that's unavoidable then?
Last question:
 Would spin_lock_irqsave() spin_unlock_irqrestore() still needed to surround
 crypto_digest_update() calls if they're going to be scattered/gathered
 later?
Thanks for your time.
