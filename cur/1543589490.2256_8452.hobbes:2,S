So what?
Refer them to mjpeg-users@lists.sourceforge.net and we'll explain them how
to use the new zoran driver until it's in the official kernel...
I mean, it be worse if they _used_ the old buz-thing, they'd start bugging
you with "how do I fix it?"
A broken driver in the kernel basically means a broken kernel - so it'd be
better to just remove it I guess... What do you think, Alan?
