The box is an IBM Thinkpad with 256MB of RAM and a 900MHz P-III cpu.
No-name IDE disk (believe me, I made sure everything there was expendable), 
workload being dbench 16 on reiserfs over loop with a 256MB reiserfs loop
file. I'm actually not entirely sure what the filesizes were as dbench
didn't report that.
Cheers,
