well the problem is that you cannot prevent a syscall from blocking really.
O_NONBLOCK only impacts the waiting for IO/socket buffer space to not do so
(in general), it doesn't impact the memory allocation strategies by
syscalls. And there's a whopping lot of that in the non-boring syscalls...
So while your heartbeat process won't block during getpid, it'll eventually
need to do real work too .... and I'm quite certain that will lead down to
GFP_KERNEL memory allocations.
