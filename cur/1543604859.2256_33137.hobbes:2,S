Thanks that makes sense for where you are targeting the performance
improvement.

O.k.  So the case that matters is when you are repeatedly reading from
the cache.

On swap-out the optimization to steal the page from the page cache
makes it much less of a problem.  But you still have to be prepared to
do the copy.  As there might be multiple users of the page, in which
case you can't steal the page cache copy.

Linus I'm sure you realized that.  I'm not certain the whole rest of the world
did.  And the shared library topic is what got this discussion going.
Hmm.  So what you are looking at is something similiar to O_DIRECT,
but that will instead of doing the I/O and bypassing the page cache,
will instead borrow the page cache copies pages.
