Hello
I am unable to get the 2nd soundcard in my server to work.  I have read
as many threads as I can and am stumped. Any guidance would sincerely be
appreciated, I want to learn ! The first soundcard continues to work
fine.....
Configuration Information is as follow:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kernel: 2.4.20-8smp (Redhat 9.0)
PCI devices: ie: lspci -v
00:08.0 Multimedia audio controller: Ensoniq 5880 AudioPCI (rev 02)
        Subsystem: Ensoniq Creative SoundBlaster AudioPCI 128

Lsmod shows:
[root@server root]# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by    Not tainted

I have created the following devices via the command
Mknod /dev/dsp2 c 14 35
Mknod /dev/dsp3 c 14 51
[root@server dev]# ls -al dsp*
crw-------    1 root     root      14,   3 Jan 30  2003 dsp
crw-------    1 root     root      14,  19 Jan 30  2003 dsp1
crw-------    1 root     root      14,  35 Feb 11 20:11 dsp2
crw-------    1 root     root      14,  51 Feb  9 21:35 dsp3
crw-------    1 root     root      14,  67 Feb  9 21:31 dsp4
I have added the following lines to /etc/modules.conf:
alias sound-slot-0 es1371
post-install sound-slot-0 /bin/aumix-minimal -f /etc/.aumixrc -L
>/dev/null 2>&1 || :
pre-remove sound-slot-0 /bin/aumix-minimal -f /etc/.aumixrc -S
>/dev/null 2>&1 || :
alias sound-slot-2 es1371
post-install sound-slot-2 /bin/aumix-minimal -f /etc/.aumixrc1 -L
>/dev/null 2>&1 || :
pre-remove sound-slot-2 /bin/aumix-minimal -f /etc/.aumixrc1 -S
>/dev/null 2>&1 || :
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am unable to play a wav file when doing:
Play -d /dev/dsp2 blah.wav , the machine sits there for the correct time
however no audio
Performing a dd to /dev/dsp, I get the following:
[root@server dev]# dd if=/dev/dsp2 | od -i
0000000  30840  30840  30840  30840  30840  30840  30840  30840
*
58+0 records in
58+0 records out
[root@server dev]
I have read the thread
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0010.2/1137.html
 and tried
all of the suggestions however it doesn't work.  I apologise if this is
a lame question however I cant seem to get my head around it.
Many thanks in anticipation !
