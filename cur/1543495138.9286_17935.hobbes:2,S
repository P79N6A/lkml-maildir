For it to be useful, we would need to omit 2, 3, 5 and 6 from that
list on an oops, as they can't be guaranteed to be safe to use. We
would therefore be writing direct to the raw disk.
The way I see this working would be to use a partition occupying
exactly one cylinder of the primary hard drive, with this partition
being treated as a circular buffer for syslog. The first sector of
this cylinder would contain details of where the beginning and end of
the currently logged text was in the said buffer, and the rest of the
cylinder would contain the text.
Let's put that into context: Both my 6G and 8G drives declare their
CHS as 255 heads, 63 sectors per track, and that maps to near enough 8
megs per cylinder. That should be plenty for a dedicated log
partition.

It also has the problem that the file (a) may be fragmented, and (b)
may not be all on one logical cylinder, both of which complicate the
code considerably.

Not necessarily - it will probably require dedicated code for the
relevant type of disk, EIDE or SCSI or whatever future types develop.

If we have an OOPS that's serious enough that we're worried about
kernel corruption, then the swap partition MUST be assumed to be
disabled as the very act of swapping is dangerous...

Not from a code point of view - the easiest way is if we can guarantee
that an entire logical cylinder is ours to play with...

Basically, the result of an OOPS can be anything from "program
aborted" to "kernel overwritten with garbage". However, there are
certain sanity checks we can do to determine a rough level of
severity, and react accordingly.
We have to make certain assumptions initially though, and these have
to be "worst case" assumptions that still leave us in a position to
actually do something. If we initially assume that the entire kernel
has been overwritten, then there's nothing we can do as none of our
code is around to do anything anyway...

Both fair enough...

If all we're logging are oops, then that's fair enough, but I'd hate
to try sending the entire syslog to a printer - I for one couldnae
afford the paper...

True...
