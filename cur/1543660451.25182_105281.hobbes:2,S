I thought your patch only fixes stuff with insufficient space and/or IO

Anyway I applied the patch and still can reproduce the problem.
Also I decided to run same test with ext3 and it deadlocked.
This time it was not absolutely vanilla kernel, so I am going to try it on
vanilla kernel and report back if it will be reproducable there.
