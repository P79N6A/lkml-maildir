Subject: 2.6.0-test7: Preempt enabled -> kernel panic

When compiling 2.6.0-test7 with preempt I get a kernel panic
when running the tst-eintr1 test program from the nptl 0.60 package.
It does not happen every time but running it repeatedly will lead
to a panic pretty quickly.
With preempt disabled it's rock solid.
Stack trace is not always the same but there always seems to
be infinite recursion. Also sometimes interrupts are disabled
(no SysRq) and sometimes not.
This is on an Athlon XP, kernel compiled with gcc 3.3.1.
Example stack trace:
...
do_page_fault+0x12c/0x454
poke_blanked_console+0x5c/0x70
try_to_wake_up+0xa7/0x160
