I understand the hardware can be destroyed.  I also understand that there are a
good number of pieces of PC hardware that have flash on them or like video cards,
are programmable.

Andre, I quite grasp this.  I stand by my earlier statement.  If it can be fixed,
write the patch and put it in and go on with life.  With all this carrying on, it's
just advertising for the malicious kiddie.  Patches like this should be written and
quietly introduced into the kernel and a tiny blurb made in the ChangeLog saying
"ATA protocol violations prohibited".  If it can't be fixed, the advertising of a
bad design flaw is certainly not a good thing.
Everybody would be inherently safer from the malicious kiddie who doesn't [yet]
know how to break things and may never know.
By carrying on about it for a week, it's a nice honeypot for that malicious kiddie
to search the archives and build a workable exploit to destroy hardware.
