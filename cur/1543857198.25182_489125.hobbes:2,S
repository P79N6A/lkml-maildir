I may be wrong, but to me it looks either like memory corruption
affecting one pgd, and by extension all of its pmds, or an old
bug in 2.4.25, but I don't recall seeing such a thing.
Anyway, I would personally reboot the server after such a thing, as I
really don't like it when VM is going mad.
Regards,
Willy
