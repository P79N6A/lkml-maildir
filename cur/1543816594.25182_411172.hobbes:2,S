	Hmm.  We only rely on SYSFS because of the policy decree of
default mounting at /sys/kernel/config (just like GregKH was asked to
put debugfs at /sys/kernel/debug).  While we create the mount point, we
don't rely on it.  You can mount configfs anywhere you like.
	So, what do you think of making that part of the code check for
CONFIG_SYSFS?  Then the module can be built without SYSFS instead of
depending on it.  I'm open to either idea.  Certainly, we don't leave
the compile error.
