OK, I bisected, and it turns out to be a bug, but not a regression.
Turns out the responsible commit is:
commit b53767719b6cd8789392ea3e7e2eb7b8906898f0

    Implement file posix capabilities
    Implement file posix capabilities.  This allows programs to be given a
    subset of root's powers regardless of who runs them, without having to use
    setuid and giving the binary all of root's powers.....
Once I turned this up, I turned went back to -git15, and turned off
CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES, and the problem went away.  Oh,
well, I had wanted to try out file capabilities, which is why I had
turned the option on, but being able to resume suspended root shells
is more important.  :-)
Serge, can you take a look at this, please?  Thanks!!
