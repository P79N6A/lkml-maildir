Hi
I am testing a PCI network device driver on linux-2.4.19.
I have observed a peculiar problem during testing.
I have a functionality which works well if the code whcih performs this
function is embedded in the required function. If this functionality is
implemented as a separate function, and this function is called at the
required place, the system crashes. I have used KDB for debugging. But,
KDB also fails when this system crash occurs.
Could this be because of any function stack overflow? I am new to this
field. Could someone through some light on this.
Thanks in advacne.
regards
Madhavi.
