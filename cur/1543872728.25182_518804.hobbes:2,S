So it has *never* worked? That's what I'm trying to see - you had a 
"before" and "after" dmesg in one of your posts, and the "before" one 
looked fine (as if it was working) because it didn't have the error 
messages.
So I'm just trying to figure out where the regression started...

What happens if you disable MSI entirely? Use "pci=nomsi" on the command 
line.
The
	ata2.00: qc timeout (cmd 0xec)
	ata2.00: failed to IDENTIFY (I/O error, err_mask=0x104)
messages happen for you on the controller that claims MSI:
	ata2: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xffffc2000008a980 ctl 0x0000000000000000 bmdma 0x0000000000000000 irq 504
and quite frankly, we've had lots of bugs with MSI, both in hardware and 
in software.
