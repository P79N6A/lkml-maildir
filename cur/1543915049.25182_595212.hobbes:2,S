Your post is incredibly ironic considering how up in arms all the
BSD folks are right now.  Many of them claiming that their code
is being "stolen".
Instead of worrying about Evil Corporation "stealing" their code,
they're worrying about Evil GPL folks "stealing".   Why don't you
take a moment to email them with a reminder that whatever GPL group X
does with their *copy*, all users of the code have the same rights.
If they really believe in the BSD license they will then calm down
and we can all go back to work.

S.
