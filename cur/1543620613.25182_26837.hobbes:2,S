It's x86 based, and like all good x86 machines, it has a mode where it will 
boot on a single CPU and look like a microchannel PC.  However, the voyagers 
were designed to be large multi-CPU SMP machines.  For SMP, it is completely 
incompatible with the APIC/IO-APIC architecture which linux supports, so the 
voyager patches provide a completely different SMP HAL, which had to be 
written from scratch; it's not merely a modification of the existing one.

I believe the last data centre machines (the 32 CPU 51xx series) rolled off 
NCR's production lines in 2001, so it is pretty much an obsolete machine now.
