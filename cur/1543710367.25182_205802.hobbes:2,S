Dear all,
Before, please cc your replies to me, as I'm not in the list right now. 
I got this whenever I'm doing '/etc/init.d/pcmcia stop'
on my Debian-Sid.

uname -a:
Linux damai 2.6.3 #2 Wed Mar 10 23:25:40 WIT 2004 i686 GNU/Linux
Also happened in 2.6.4-rc2.
Not yet tested in 2.6.4,
but a quick scans on the 2.6.4 patches, I didn't see any fix.
Any body knows about this?
TIA.
Best Regards,
