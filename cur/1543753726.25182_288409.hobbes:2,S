What does "using" mean?  Is the program executing from that location?

Interesting.  IIRC, opterons will very occasionally (and incorrectly) take
a fault when performing a prefetch against a dud pointer.  The kernel will
fix that up.  At a guess, I'd say tha the fixup code isn't doing the right
thing when the faulting EIP is in the vsyscall page.
