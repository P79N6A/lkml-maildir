Thats beyond paranoia. 
The source mentions a malicious attacker, but if such an attacker has
control of the thermal generator in your system you have bigger problems.
If this is indeed a concern, perhaps a more secure 'stir-in' function in
needed.
Rember:
If X xor Y = Z, and Y has an uncertanty of zero then Z has the same
uncertanty of X.
