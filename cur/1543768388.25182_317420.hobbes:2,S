We found that this has nothing to do with the timer patches. There is a
scribble in pcie_rootport_aspm_quirk that overwrites ptype_all.
quirk_aspm_offset[GET_INDEX(pdev->device, dev->devfn)]= cap_base + 0x10;
does the evil deed. The array offset calculated by GET_INDEX is out of
bounds.
The definition of GET_INDEX is suspect:
#define GET_INDEX(a, b) (((a - PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_MCH_PA) << 3) + b)
should this not be
#define GET_INDEX(a, b) ((((a) - PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_MCH_PA) << 3) + \
				((b) & 7))
?
