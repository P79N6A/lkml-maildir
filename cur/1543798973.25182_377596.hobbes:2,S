Greetings all;
I just rebooted to 2.6.15-rc6, built with the new 'size' option on, but 
had some problems with the reboot process from -rc5.  Compiler is 
gcc-3.3.3-7.
When I killed X by logging out, I got a loud cacaphonic sound from 
artsd, and no keyboard echo could be seen in vt1 when I typed reboot.
And now, rebooted to -rc6, kmail is virtually unusable because the 
system feels as if something is hogging it 100% of the cpu time.
Echo's to the composer screen of what I type are 2 or more seconds 
being shown on screen too.
But according to kpm, everything looks kosher.  Weird.  Scheduler is 
CK's.
Does anybody have any suggestions?
