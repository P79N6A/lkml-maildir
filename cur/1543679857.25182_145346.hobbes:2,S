Is it really necessary to turn half the apic code upside down in order
to fix this? What's the actual bugfix that's buried in this cleanup?
Despite the fact you seem to have gone out of your way to make this
hard to review, there are a few things I can see that strike me as odd.
Not necessarily wrong, but requiring more explanation.

Is that always correct? it's not equivalent.

Is that the actual one-line bugfix this is all about?

So ... you've tested that change on a bigsmp machine, right? 
At least, provide some reasoning here. Like this comment further down the
patch ...

Which makes the change just look wrong to me. If you're thinking 
"physical clustered mode" that terminology just utterly confusing crap, 
and the change is wrong, as far as I can see.

Hmmmm. What are you using physical apicids here for? They seem
irrelevant to this function.
