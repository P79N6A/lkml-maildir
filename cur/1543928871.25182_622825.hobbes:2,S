One major concern could be whether a continuous writer dirting pages
at the 'right' pace will generate a steady flow of write I/Os which are
_tiny_hence_inefficient_.
I have gathered some timing info about writeback speed in
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/4/468.
 For ext3, it takes wb_kupdate()
~15ms to submit 4MB. Whereas one disk I/O typically takes ~5ms. So if
there are too many tiny write I/Os, they will simply get delayed and
merged into bigger ones.
So it's not a problem in *theory* :-)

Thank you.

There are some discussions and patches on inode number based writeback
clustering which you may want to reference/compare with:
