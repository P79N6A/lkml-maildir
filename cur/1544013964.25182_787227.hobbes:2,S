A quick `git grep strncat' shows a few more misusers of strncat() that may
cause buffer overflows and should be converted to strlcat():
| drivers/media/video/usbvideo/konicawc.c:	strncat(cam->input_physname, "/input0", sizeof(cam->input_physname));
| drivers/media/video/usbvideo/quickcam_messenger.c:	strncat(cam->input_physname, "/input0", sizeof(cam->input_physname));
| drivers/media/video/uvc/uvc_driver.c:		strncat(format->name, buffer[8] & (1 << 7) ? " 60Hz" : " 50Hz",
| usr/gen_init_cpio.c:                       strncat(expanded, getenv(env_var), PATH_MAX);
| usr/gen_init_cpio.c:                       strncat(expanded, end + 1, PATH_MAX);
Let's hope I didn't miss any. Good night! ;-)

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
