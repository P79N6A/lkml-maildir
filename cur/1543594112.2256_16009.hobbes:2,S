Try out the 
http://lse.sourceforge.net/scheduling
  patches. The MQ kernel
scheduler sure can handle this
kind of load :-)

Thread creation may be a bit slow. But the kludges to provide posix threads
completely from userspace also hurt. Notably, they do not scale over
multiple CPUs.

POSIX threads are silly with respect to signals. I do almost all my
programming these days with pthreads and I find that I really do not miss
signals at all.

I got that response too. When I pressed kernel people for details it turns
out that they think having hundreds of runnable threads/processes (mostly
the same thing under Linux) is wasteful. The scheduler is just not
optimised
for that.
