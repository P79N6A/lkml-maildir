Subject: modifying degraded raid 1 then re-adding other members is bad

Assume I have a fully-functional raid 1 between two disks, one
hot-pluggable and the other fixed.
If I unplug the hot-pluggable disk and reboot, the array will come up
degraded, as intended.
If I then modify a lot of the data in the raid device (say it's my
root fs and I'm running daily Fedora development updates :-), which
modifies only the fixed disk, and then plug the hot-pluggable disk in
and re-add its members, it appears that it comes up without resyncing
and, well, major filesystem corruption ensues.
Is this a known issue, or should I try to gather more info about it?
This happened with 2.6.18rc3-git[367] (not sure which), plus Fedora
development patches.
