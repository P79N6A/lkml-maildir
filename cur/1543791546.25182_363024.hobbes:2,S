We don't, thanks for pointing that out. It will be removed.

Would you care to explain, providing its short, what it does? I don't
mind admitting I don't know everything, especially when it comes to
kernel code. If I am to RTFM, please point me to the right M. :)

We do call them directly as long as DEBUG is not defined. This code
exists for development purposes (or debug, if you will) so that we can
track memory allocations and other various things in the logs. All
wrappers for the common kernel functions are #defined in
ecryptfs_kernel.h so via preprocessing, it all becomes pretty.
Of course, these can be removed, assuming that this is not an
acceptable approach.
