Anything relying on *that* is already broken and needs to be fixed:
think of compiling 8390 into the kernel and having a modular ne and
3c503.
Ted made the good point that some code may be making assumptions and
marking things __init* which are also needed on module unload.  This is 
the only case to worry about, though -- the other is *already* broken.
