There are no 3ware changes in pre3. So it must be reiserfs or something
else. Lets try reverting the reiserfs patches to see if they are the
cause?
Attached are files rei1, rei2, and rei3 (all gzip compressed).
They are the three reiserfs changesets which have been included in -pre3.
Can you please revert them (with patch -R) and try to reproduce the
problem?
Thanks
