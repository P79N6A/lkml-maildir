It depends on the quality of the screen you're looking at.  On television
sets, you really don't want black on white for good visual quality, but on
modern monitors (and particularly LCD monitors), black on white is fine.
Having the colour balance set poorly will also have a bad effect, which
would be minimised by using white on black, but I'd much rather just
adjust my monitor :-)
