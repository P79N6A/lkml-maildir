2 solutions without list head:
1.
#define slist_del_next(_entry_in)			\
do {							\
	typeof(_entry_in) _entry = (_entry_in),		\
			  _next  = (_entry)->next;	\
	_entry->next = _next->next;			\
	_next->next = NULL;				\
} while (0)
2.	The previous entry points to the address that _entry has. If we 
	copy _entry somewhere else and overwrite the old _entry with 
	_entry->next, we made it without knowing the list topology. The 
	previous->next still points to the new _entry, things are fine.
My problem is just: where to put the old _entry? Anyway, since we're 
talking about list entry deletion, we could copy it nowhere and just 
overwrite it with _entry->next...
Details, details...
