Well no.  If you have 4GB of ram, and a proper BIOS, then you NEED a
kernel configured for 64GB ram since PCI will take at least 0.5GB of it
and make it remapped above the 4GB address.  So describing the
CONFIG_4GB option as being correct for people with 1 to 4GB ram is very
much wrong for almost all systems.  It would only be correct for those
systems where the bios or chipset incorrectly does not remap memory
above the PCI address space.  The current description is in fact wrong
when the bios isn't broken.  Somewhere around 3 or 3.5GB seems to be the
limit for the CONFIG_4GB option.  Any more and you need the CONFIG_64GB
option instead, unless your bios and/or chipset sucks in which case you
simply loose the ram in the PCI space and you might as well stick with
the CONFIG_4GB option to keep full performance.
