Subject: SLRAM and IDE patches in 2.3.x?

A while back, I asked about the slram patch to use non-cacheable
memory as ramdisk/swap, and why it wasn't in the kernel proper.
The response from the authors was more or less that it had
slipped their mind to offer it to Linus, or something like that.
They indicated an interest in doing so however, but I do not see
it yet.
Could these patches please be submitted ASAP to Linus himself,
for possible inclusion in 2.3.x?  
Are the new IDE patches in 2.3.x yet, and if not, can we please
get them in Andre?  They seem to work fine on any systems I've
tested them on, regardless of chipset, etc...
