Not everyone agrees that that is the proper way to do things, some prefer 
full disclosure.
Personally I'd prefer full disclosure on a public mailing list (copying 
vendors, maintainers etc of course), so as many people as possible can get 
to work on a fix as soon as possible. Keeping things secret doesn't speed 
up the time to get a fix made.
