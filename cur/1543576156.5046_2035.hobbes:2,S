That's a good point and it would probably work for attachment of cpus, but
it won't work for detachment because there are some data structures that
need to be updated if a cpu gets detached. For example it would be nice
to flush the per-cpu cache of the detached cpu in the slabcache. Then one
has to think of pending tasklets for the detached cpu which should be
moved to another cpu and then there are a lot of per-cpu data structures
in the networking part of the kernel.. most of them seem to be for
statistics only but I think these structures should be updated in any
case.
So at least for detaching it would make sense to register functions which
will be called whenever a cpu gets detached.
