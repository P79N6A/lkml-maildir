Hello!
It seems that you can disable MTD partitioning support 
but enable , e.g. NAND.
And, if you are upgrading from and older kernel without
the paritioning option, and do oldconfig and are not careful,
thats what you end up with.
But, lots of code is calling del_mtd_partitions now, so you get
unresolved del_mtd_partitions.
Its easy to work around this by enabling partitioning, but
should not the dependency be added in the relevant KConfig?
Cc me directly, I'm not on the list.
Thanks,
MST
