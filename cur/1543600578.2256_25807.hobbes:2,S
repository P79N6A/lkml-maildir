I have to agree for the most part.  My system used to use a lot of cache,
and swapped all of the time with 300+MBs of ram on a Linus 2.4 kernel, now with
-ac my swap is under 1kB with the same apps and load.  I can even run ext3
now without another patch :).
One thing I have noticed is that I still see my system accessing the drive
softly for about 30 second time periods a few times a day.  I didn't see
this on 2.2, and vmstat doesn't show any paging traffic, but it does show
about 48 avg pages/sec going out to the disk.  I haven't really looked very
hard to find the culprit.  Has anyone else noticed this?
[OT] Hmm, why isn't ext3 in the Linus kernel yet?  It seems more mature than
reiserfs was when it was included back in 2.4.1...
