Hi,
 I want to make a Bootable RAID.
 can I make a partition on the disk which I want to
 make as bootable or should I be use whole disk?
 What I mean is like this:
  In the lilo.conf file I do like this:
   disk = /dev/md0
   boot = /dev/hdc
  Is this all what I can do? or can I make a  partiton
  in /dev/hdc & specify that as disk?
  In that case lilo.conf file will be like this:
  disk = /dev/md0
  boot = /dev/hdc1
  can I use partition of the disk as boot?
 Expecting reply from you
with regards,
  Anil
