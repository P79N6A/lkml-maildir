It's a multi-function chip (again):
            sa1111 bus
    SA1111------+-------Interrupt controller
                +-------USB host
                +-------PS/2 ports
The SA1111 probe function registers devices whose parent is the SA1111
device.
In this case, we end up placing these devices on the list in the wrong
order.
At the point where the SA1111 probe function is called, the SA1111 device
is not on the dpm lists, because of the ordering in device_add().
When we add the USB host, PS/2 ports etc, their parent device has not
been added to the dpm lists.  Only after the SA1111 probe function
completes will the SA1111 device appear on the dpm lists, and in this
case it will appear _after_ the USB and PS/2 ports.
The effect of this is that when we do a device suspend, we suspend
the SA1111, then the PS/2 ports, then the USB host.  Unfortunately
this can't work because suspending the SA1111 prevents access to
these sub-devices.

This doesn't happen - take a careful look at device_add(), specifically
the order of bus_add_device() and device_pm_add().  We probe the device
_before_ we add it to the PM lists.

It sounds more complicated than our old system, but I'm willing to give
it a go.  However, some drivers only want to be notified of resume events,
so this would involve more code to explicitly handle the suspend case in
such drivers.
Dunno, I'll wait until there's a patch available and see how well it fits.
