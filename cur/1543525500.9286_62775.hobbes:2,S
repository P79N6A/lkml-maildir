Hi,
  As a bit of followup to this, which I think I mentioned on
the linux-usb mailing list, MPS 1.4 mode will work with
kernel 2.3.42 if I pass noapic on the command line, so it
seems to me to be related to the apic stuff.  I'm in the
process of narrowing down which 2.3.x kernel it stopped working
with in MPS 1.4 mode, since I know for sure that 2.3.18 works.
