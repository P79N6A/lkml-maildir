This was already discussed on kbuild list.
It is better to have only 1 Configure.help. This help
translation of
the file and help busy developers. They should not rewrite
texts
in every Configure.help.
If you should provide a special help on a specific ARCH you
could
modify the symbols:
instead of
: bool 'std IPC support' CONFIG_IPC
you can do:
: bool 'arch specific IPC help' CONFIG_IPC_STRANGE_ARCH
: define_bool CONFIG_IPC CONFIG_IPC_STRANGE_ARCH
ESR CML2 have the defualt path for Configure.help build in
the rules files, but it can be overriden by command options
to use an other Configure.help (the format do not change).
It is also designed so that a distribution can include
a translation of Configure.help. (But we don't expect
to include translation in std linux kernel)

$ARCH is set on the top of the main Makefile. You can copy
the small shell script from here.
