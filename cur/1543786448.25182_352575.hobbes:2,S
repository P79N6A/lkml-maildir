Hmm.. the wireless card in this is (a) an Orinoco and (b) not ejectable, as
it's a built-in, and (c) wasn't even in use at the time...
i8042 is on IRQ1, and the warp-drive modem is on IRQ11.  And the USB that had
the still-working mouse is on IRQ11 too.
Anybody got a better idea than running a cronjob every 5 mins that runs
oprofile for 1 minute, and dumping the stats, and waiting for it to hit again?
