Ok.  Any chance you could help me track down which application is
ultimately calling proc_set_tty (I think it has pid 296 in your case).
From what I can tell reading the source it is calling
TIOCSCTTY with the arg field set to 1.  Which is a linux extension
to force other people off of the tty.
My skimming of the implementation says to me that we are forcing
other processes of the tty in the wrong way.  I think we should call
tty_vhangup (so those processes kicked off get normal terminal hangup
behavior) and not simply session_clear_tty.  However if I am correct the
implementation has been broken for over a decade so I am reluctant to
just change it without tracking down the users.  
The patch below is what I am looking at for a comprehensive fix.  I
think it fixes the second set of leaks in a better manner by simply
fixing callers to do the sane thing.
