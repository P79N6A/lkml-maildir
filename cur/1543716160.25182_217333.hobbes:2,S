What kernel version are you using?  If 2.6, what value of
/proc/sys/vm/swappiness?

I just did a 4GB `dd if=/dev/sda of=/x bs=1M' on a 1GB 2.6.6-rc2-mm2
swappiness=85 machine here and there was no swapout at all.
Probably your machine has less memory.  But without real, hard details
nothing can be done.

Sure, we could do better things with the large streaming files, although
the risk of accidentally screwing up particular workloads is high.
But the use-once logic which we have in there at present does handle these
cases quite well.

What kernel, what system specs, what swappiness setting?
