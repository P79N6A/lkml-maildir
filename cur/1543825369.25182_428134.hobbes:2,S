looks good to me.

ok. There's one bit that could potentially be 2.6.17 material:

get_unmapped_area() without holding the mmap semaphore seems dangerous. 
The VDSO setup itself should be 'private' to the process, but i'm not 
totally sure that no other kernel code could get access to this mm. For 
example the swapout code? Am i missing something?
