It sure is:
/**
 * in_atomic_region() - determine whether it is legal to perform a context
 *                      switch
 *
 * The in_atomic_region() predicate returns true if the current task is
 * executing atomically, and may not perform a context switch.
 *
 * If preemption is enabled, in_atomic_region() is most accurate, because it
 * returns true if this task has taken any spinlocks.
 *
 * If preemption is disabled then there is no spinlocking record available, and
 * we can only look at the interrupt state.
 *
 * If the task has taken a lock_kernel() then it is still legal to perform a
 * context switch.

Well I added checks just to kmalloc, kmem_cache_alloc, __alloc_pages
and saw a shower of bloopers during bootup.  Such as drivers/ide/probe.c:init_irq()
calling request_irq() inside ide_lock.

Well I like it.  It's unintrusive, imparts useful info to the reader
and checks stuff at runtime.

I don't think it needs splitting.  You have the core infrastructure plus
a couple of example applications.

These things are self-evident and even self-checking.  They don't need
supporting documentation.   I'll put out a test tree RSN, include this
in it.
