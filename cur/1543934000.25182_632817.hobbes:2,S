This is exactly the same as with tifm_sd module if you noticed.
First, there are no modaliases for tifm (I was thinking to add them later, when at least two card
types are supported, if at all), so the appropriate udev rule should be added (similar to the sd
one).
Second, it is impossible to guess in advance, which type of card is put into slot (Pro, legacy or
IO of either sort). Same as mmc_block, actually. The only way to get it autoloaded, is, again,
with appropriate udev rule (uevent is emitted when card type is detected).
