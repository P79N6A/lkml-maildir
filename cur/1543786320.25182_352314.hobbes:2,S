I thought it was my imagination at first, but now I have some slightly 
more convincing evidence of what is going on...
With 2.6.13.1 & 2 as I move my mouse around the screen, I get random 
clicks on things the mouse passes.  Seems to happen more often with the 
first move from idle, but in general, it is just totally random...
With 2.6.9-11.EL and 2.6.12.6 (stock kernel.org) I do NOT get this.
Anyone else seeing this?
I would blame the OS/WM/X, as I have recently upgraded to CentOS4, but 
now I have tried a few different kernels in the process of getting a 
stable config for my wireless setup and I am convinced that the only 
variable that seems to matter is the kernel version.  I have had this 
laptop for about a year and prior configs never had any mouse issues.
Config:
2.6.13.1 & 2 from kernel.org .config is the "default" from CentOS 4 - 
happy to post if anyone is interested.
Machine:
    Dell 8600 Pentium M 2GHz 1.5G ram
Mouse:
    touch pad PS/2 - dmesg/proc do not seem to show anything more 
specific than that
    PNP: PS/2 Controller [PNP0303:KBC,PNP0f13:PS2M] at 0x60,0x64 irq 1,12
OS:
    CentOS 4.1 - KDE 3.3 stock config
