BTW, I am amazed all these s/idx/irx/ bugs exist and no one noticed
them.
I guess nothing uses these irq variants.  In fact, grepping the
source... wow, not much uses brlocks at all.  Only registered lock is
BR_NETPROTO_LOCK.  A read lock on it is called only 7 times and a write
lock is used 31 times.
Everything must of moved over to using RCU or something.  It makes me
question the future of these things.
