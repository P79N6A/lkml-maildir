Subject: Modular filesystem using drop_inode would need inode_lock

This is mostly a logical inconsistency at the moment (since the
only filesystem that has a "drop_inode" function defined in its
super_operations is hugetlbfs, and it is unlikely to move out of
the kernel and into a module).  But the ->drop_inode() function
is called with inode_lock held, and it is expected to drop the
lock ... which would be impossible for a module as the lock is
not exported.
