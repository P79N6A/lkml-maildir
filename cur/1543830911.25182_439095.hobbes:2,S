Subject: SA_TRIGGER_* vs. SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM

Since SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM is defined as "SA_RESTART", it
could be just about any value.
On sparc, it's value is "2", so it aliases some of
the SA_TRIGGER_* defines the new genirq code adds.
And therefore we get a bunch of these on sparc64:
[   16.650540] setup_irq(2) SA_TRIGGERset. No set_type function available
(btw: missing space in the kernel log message between 'SA_TRIGGER'
      and 'set' :-)
I can't see any reason why SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM is set to
a signal mask value, or why IRQ flags are defined in
linux/signal.h :-)
Anyways, probably the best bet for now is to define
SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM explicitly to some value instead of
relying on the arbitrary platform definition of SA_RANDOM.
Ingo could you cook up and submit a patch which does this?
Thanks.
