What a horrible idea!  The nice things about ext3 are:
 - the rather simple and thus reliable implementation
 - the lack of incompatible ondisk changes
and the block numbers are't the big problem concerning scalability, there's
a lot more to it, like btree(-like) structures in the allocator, parallel
alloocator algorithms and a better allocation group concept.
If you guys want big storage on linux please help improving the filesystems
design for that, e.g. jfs or xfs instead of showhorning it onto ext3 thus
both making ext3 less reliable for us desktop/small server users and not get
the full thing for the big storage people either.
