We should ensure there is nothing unrecognized in that elf
section to allow for future expandability.  I'm imagining ACL's,
new privs etc now.

I think rather this should be treated how we currently treat suid
bits, on write, remove them.  This has 3 advanteges:
1) Since we already do it for other bits this method is well understood.
2) There is less logic involed then insuring immutability.
3) We need to do this even on capability enabled filesystems, because
   we can't trust an executeable no matter how it is modified.
Actually point 3 is probably the best justification of putting this into
the executable header.  A write to the executeable should nullify the capabilities
anyway.
There are 2 other places that need to be looked at:
1) Old kernels.
2) Foreign filesystems.
1) For old kernels (and to cut down on races) whatever sets the 
   capabilities flags should also set the ext2 immutable bit.
   That way the binary will not be changed by accident.
2) We will need a nocap setting for mounting filesystems so we don't
   use untrusted capabilities.  Ideally this should cause the cap flag
   to be hidden so interpreters like perl can't see it and implement
   capabilites on their own scripts.
Just my 2 cents,
Eric
