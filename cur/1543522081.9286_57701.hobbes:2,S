Aaaargh. Fixed limit means guaranteed termination, for one. And there are
other issues. Really.

Not. There are rather nasty issues with VFS (currently _not_ in a good
state) and fixing them will make those animals very different. Passing
through the symlink may have (and in many cases has) side effects. Sorry.

No, they are not and they were not. Sorry, it _is_ UNIX. If you don't know
where the links are used - too bad.

... unless we are doing Plan 9-ish namespaces, which _will_ happen. Unless
we are mounting the same thing twice. Unless we have loopback mount.

Oh, please! I'm quite fine with 64K characters per line limit in nvi,
thank you very much.

Yes, it happens. And?

Frankly, I don't. xargs is there for purpose.

	Like hell it is. If you are talking about admin stuff - the job
is to keep it running, in the first place (and not mine those days -
recovery is sweet and all such). If you are talking about VFS - you
got the source, you want changes, you send patches.

	Umhm... And after the structure change you have all sorts of fun
chasing the new locations. And when the space goes low you have all sorts
of fun moving the stuff around. And when duhveloper (who has root, doncha
know?) fscks the system up (along with quite a few of those symlinks) you
have tons of fun restoring them. And then you have duhveloper foo who had
set up his own quagmire of symlinks to stuff from duhvelopers bar, baz and
quux (mostly their pr0n archives) and did it in all sorts of interesting
ways. Guess who is paged at 3am with request to restore them into working
state due yesterday? And then you are getting all sorts of funny stuff
when some lackwit (PHB's FOAF, ergo the holy cow you can't LART out 
of existence) decides to move the stuff around and gets $BIGNUM of
copies all over the place. And then there is a bright duhveloper (who
can't be bothered to clean his fscking .rhosts, BTW) and said luser brings
his own box with k3wl OS. He "knows computer stuff", so he admins the
thing himself. Unfortunately he calls you up whenever the things fall
apart. And they do, since his NFS client barfs on the hell you have on
server. Not that you could honestly call that its fault. Aaaarrrgh...
Been there, done that, still have the scares.

Right. And if you got to 32 layers of indirection (we are talking about
the limit on recursion, don't forget it) you are using the wrong tools.
Not to mention the fact that keeping this structure in _your_ memory
(wetware one) is a nightmare.

Let's stop it, OK? I'm less than happy about digging out EMACS source and
picking a collection of sucking code. I can do that, but let's do it
outside of l-k. I suspect that bugs-glibc is also not a proper place for
that. Besides, I got rather impressive collection of lossage on hands
right now ;-/
