I run a CD burner on a USB2.0 port as my main backup device, and a 160GB
external drive as well. I have been running 2.6.7-rc1-mm1+np (Nick
Piggin patches) for some time now, and nothing since has been any faster
or better for a small desktop.
I wanted to try some patches against 2.6.9-rc3, so before adding -ck or
-mm patch sets I tried the base build. I noted that when I ran the
script to load the modules for the USB CD, the CD wasn't found. As a
caution the hard drive was not connected.
I attach a zip file with dmesg output, configes, and a FULL hardware
description output by lshw. I will try the latest -bk if I get a chance,
after 10-06 I will be off-net for a few weeks.

Hope this is enough to be useful, if I try the latest -bk I'll post results.
