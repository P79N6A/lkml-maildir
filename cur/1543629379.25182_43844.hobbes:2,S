Andrea VM changes are touching performance and stability critical parts of
the code. I cannot simply merge of all them at one time.
What I'm doing is to merge each part separately (for example, 2.4.19 will
have the writeout scheduling changes) so they can be tested separately by
lots of people when final releases are done.
Also I'm trying to understand his changes. I'm not going to merge
senseless stuff.
The writeout scheduling changes were excellent.
