Don't know if it is related, but you should upgrade your modutils up to
2.4, even 2.4.1 is yet available.
I have noticed something similar. If I start gqmpeg from the command line in
a terminal (rxvt), sounds fine. If I start it from the icon in the gnome
panel, it makes that 'toc toc' noise you describe. ????
(I know it sounds strange, but real...)
How do you launch your sound test ? (btw, which do you use to play sound ?)
