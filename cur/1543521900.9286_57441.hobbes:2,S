Hi,
I have been reporting some time ago (around 2.2.10) a problem with my
pcmcia ethernet card. It is a ENW-3502 from Planet and NE2000 compatible.
My Laptop is a Highscreen LeBook Premium, Pentium 133MHz. So here is the
situation now:
In 2.2.14 and before (even in some 2.0.36) I am getting errors in the logs
like the following:
...
eth0: mismatched read page pointers  1 vs 6d.
eth0: mismatched read page pointers  1 vs 65.
eth0: mismatched read page pointers  1 vs 7d.
eth0: mismatched read page pointers  1 vs 5a.
eth0: mismatched read page pointers  1 vs 6d.
eth0: mismatched read page pointers  1 vs 7a.
...
This especially happens under lots of network load, e.g. it is perfectly
achievable with ping -f somehost. 
In 2.3.36 and 2.3.39 while using CARDBUS support and no I82365 I do _not_
get these error messages any more.
However, in 2.3.40pre1 they reappear ! Furthermore, I noticed that with
CARDBUS support the card doesn't seem to get reset during a (cold) reboot,
that is it is still showing network activity (lights are blinking). Now,
after running 2.3.40pre1 and rebooting to 2.3.39 the error messages appear
even in 2.3.39, but when I switch off the machine they are gone in 2.3.39.
BTW, I am using pcmcia-cs.11-Jan-00.
So if somebody could shine some light into this, I would be very happy.
