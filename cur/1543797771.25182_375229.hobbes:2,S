Interrupts need to be disabled because the processing of the byte sized 
differential could be interrupted.

There is no increment or decrement right now. We add an offset and that 
offset could easily burst the limits of a byte sized differential. A check 
needs to happen before the differential is updated.

local_t is long on ia64. 
The atomics are used for global updates of counters in struct zone and the 
vm_stats array. local_t wont help there.
local_t could be used for the differentials. Special functions for 
increment and decrement could use the non-interruptible nature of inc/decs 
on i386 and x86_64.
There is no byte sized local_t though so its difficult to use local_t 
here. I think this whole local_t stuff is not too useful after all. 
Could we add an incp/decp macro that is like cmpxchg? That macro should 
be able to operation on various sizes of counters.
