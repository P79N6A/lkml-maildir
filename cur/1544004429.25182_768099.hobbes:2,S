OK, then my next step will be to send Rafael an updated version of
my hierarchical RCU, which is more robust than classic RCU against
online/offline stress tests.  On the machines I have access to, anyway.  ;-)
Then I will look at preemptable RCU, which undoubtably needs some of the
same help that I have been giving to hierarchical RCU.  Manfred thus
wins the clairvoyance award!
