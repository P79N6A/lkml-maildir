The Dell i5000e crashes when switching between mains and battery when
the disk is active, so you might try to plug/unplug with the system
quiet.
If this works, you'll be in a *little* better spot.
As for hanging, you might try suspending it (i.e., close the display)
and opening it back up.  This works for the i5000e; it also clears the
display that sometimes goes *nuts* when switching video modes.  This
last behavior has only surfaced with the latest A06 BIOS.
