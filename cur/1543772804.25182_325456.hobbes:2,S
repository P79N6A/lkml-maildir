There are two ways C-state addresses are exported to OS.
     - Some flags in the FADT (-> ACPI spec) -> this gives you two C-states maximum, AFAIK.
     - Through the _CST function in your DSDT (-> ACPI spec, sorry). If you have
       have a look in dsdt.dsl at the _CST function there are that much packages returned as
       your BIOS claims to support. Hmm, _CST code is often in the SSDT an extention
       of the DSDT code. If you have one: acpidmp > acpidmp; acpixtract ssdt acpidmp >my_ssdt;
       iasl -d my_ssdt.
If your dsdt/ssdt compiles again without errors (better tell me privately if you get some),
you should not have much hope, higher states are probably not supported.
You could also increase ACPI debug output when loading the processor module to get more information:
cat /proc/acpi/debug_level /proc/acpi/debug_layer
echo 0x00000FFF >/proc/acpi/debug_level      (or whatever enables INFO, you need ACPI_DEBUG defined)
modprobe processor
