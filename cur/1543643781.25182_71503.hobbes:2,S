Hmm, it seems strange (and rather unsafe) that you would run a mail
spool without using sync I/O.  Unfortunate too, because sync I/O with
a large journal (and perhaps an external journal disk) would give you
very fast throughput on ext3.

Lots of it.  So, that is 250 * (1 dir block + 1 inode bitmap + 1 inode
table block (+ 1 block bitmap + 1 data block, if there is data in the
dotlock file)) = 1250 blocks/second or so.

Probably (no disk I/O generated), but I don't know the state of NFS locking.

One reason why we are adding hash-indexed directory support to ext3, so
that you don't have to implement it in each application.
