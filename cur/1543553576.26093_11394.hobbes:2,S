In the discussion on "select bug", some people noted that select does not 
wake up a process until the buffer is half full (or all full, or 
whatever).  Does this mean that if a small amount is written to the 
device/pipe the process may never be woken?  Or is there a time limit that 
wakes up the process after a certain amount of time if there are _any_ 
bytes in the pipe/dev?
