Subject: [RFC] New driver for vpx3224 video pixel decoder

Hello,
I've written a new driver for the vpx3224/5 chip's.  It is based on the 
structure of Laurent Pinchart's vpx3220 driver found in the 2.6 kernel, 
and the vpx322x driver from the v3tv.sourceforge.net project.
You can find it at 
http://gilfillan.org:8000/vpx3224/
I have three or four users reporting success at this time.
I've developed it on the 2.4 kernel.  The v3tv driver needs more work 
before I can test it on 2.6.  The changes seem to be trivial.
I'll look forward to your comments.
Thanks,
Perry
