I have two heavily used servers working great on the BP6.  Standard
configuration SMP and using the BX chipset's UDMA EIDE.  I'm not using the
onboard HPT366 controller either.  Perhaps thats a main cause of people's
problems.  I did have one issue of funckiness.  A 12/24 SCSI DAT drive
tended to lose the ability to eject the tape without rebooting on this
machine.  Don't know if it was a board problem, drive problem, scsi problem,
driver problem, or a weird combination.  That tape has since been moved over
to a FreeBSD 4.0 separate backup server.  And on there, different hardware,
the drive works correctly most of the time occassionally though rarely the
drive appears to die off, unusable in the system, until the machine is
completely powered off and then rebooted.  Because of this I am still
uncertain whether the original problems were due to the board or the tape
drive.
