Hi,
after upgrading to kernel 2.6.0 on client-side i cannot copy data from 
my (old) nfs server. The server is old (running SuSE 7.1 with a 2.4.19 
kernel) and supports only nfs version 2.
But with kernels 2.6.0 upto 2.6.1-mm2 after few seconds of copying a 
remote-file to the client the client hangs completely.
Kernel was compiled with gcc 3.3.1 and has preemptive enable.
No entry in the syslog....
Any idea except upgrading the server?
No problems with kernel 2.4.x....
Regards,
Axel
