I suppose this isn't exactly specific to linux kernel.  I have some programs
running at work, each writing results to stdout.  Each is running within a
shell within some type of xterm-like device.  I want to be able to check on
the results from home.
I know if I had thought about it in advance, I could use screen, or even
xemacs/gnuclient.
I'm wondering if I can get anything by looking at /proc/pid/fd/.  
For example, I'm running top and I see:
ls -l /proc/5012/fd/
total 0
lrwx------    1 nbecker  nbecker        64 Jun 14 20:24 0 -> /dev/pts/2
lrwx------    1 nbecker  nbecker        64 Jun 14 20:24 1 -> /dev/pts/2
lrwx------    1 nbecker  nbecker        64 Jun 14 20:24 2 -> /dev/pts/2
lr-x------    1 nbecker  nbecker        64 Jun 14 20:24 3 -> /proc/uptime
lr-x------    1 nbecker  nbecker        64 Jun 14 20:24 4 -> /proc/stat
lr-x------    1 nbecker  nbecker        64 Jun 14 20:24 5 -> /proc/loadavg
lr-x------    1 nbecker  nbecker        64 Jun 14 20:24 6 -> /proc/meminfo
I guess the problem is I can't find any documentation on devpts.  Maybe if I
could find some I'd be able to figure out a device I could open to peek at
the stdout of a process?
