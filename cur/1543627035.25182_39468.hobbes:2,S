Well, the fact that ext2 uses fixed areas of the disk for specific
purposes (e.g. inode table) and it has backups of a lot of metadata
makes it very possible to recover from random data corruption.

Note that this is incorrect.  Even with ext3, e2fsck is run on each
boot.  While in the normal case all it does is journal recovery (takes
a few seconds at most) and do a superficial check of the superblock.
This is incredibly useful, however, if there was a filesystem error,
since e2fsck has a chance to check and cleanup the filesystem before
it is put into use.
Cheers, Andreas
