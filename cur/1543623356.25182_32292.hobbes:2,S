Hi, knowing less that diddly squat about the code being discussed.
I would like to mention that I usually use some little macro's
to get rid of code like:
  lock( my_lock);
  if ( exp) {
    unlock( my_lock);
    /* do fancy stuph */
  } else
    unlock( my_lock);
and make it look like this:
#define LOCK_EXP_F( exp, lock, f_lock, f_unlock)   \
  ({ typeof( exp) e;                               \
     f_lock( lock);                                \
     e = (exp);                                    \
     f_unlock( lock);                              \
     e; })
#define PAGELOCK_EXP( exp, page)                   \
  LOCK_EXP_F( exp, page, pte_chain_lock, pte_chain_unlock)
  if ( PAGELOCK_EXP( !page->pte_chain && 
                     (!page->buffers || do_flushpage( page, 0)), page))
    lru_cache_del( page);
If this is a not accepted coding style, so be it.
Another little thing I've been wondering about is why keep using
LRU style caches. Has anybody ever thought about using LRU-K
caches? I know, they aren't O(1), but O(log(n)) isn't that bad
agains the advantages:
 - easier to make concurrent (no head contention)
 - better caching properties (takes low frequency
   entries and cache sweeps into account)
just my 2ct.
