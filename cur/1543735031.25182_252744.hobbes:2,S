Well, two.
1) If you send me an event "/dev/hda3 mounted", but it was for some other
namespace, you just leaked potentially useful information.
I'm no security expert, but that seems to me to be a gratuitous leak.
Maybe it's just another example of why namespaces need to go away.
2) If you send me an event "/dev/hda3 mounted" do I also get an event when
I loopback mount /tmp/rh9.0-1.iso or when I bind mount /foo to /bar or
when I mount server:/export/home on /home?
If you're notifying me of mounts and unmounts, I really want to know about
all of them, not just mounts that have a hard local device.  I'd rather
get "something was mounted" and be forced to probe that (that's a leak,
too, but less important).
