Subject: [PROBLEM] "ls -R" freezes when using gnome-terminal on linux-2.6.0-test4

I have discovered a regression between linux-2.4.20-8 (Redhat 9) and
linux-2.6.0-test4. I have not tried any other versions of linux-2.6.0-testX
or 2.5.x.
How to reproduce the problem:
1. Running GNOME on linux-2.6.0-test4, open two gnome-terminals.
2. In the first gnome-terminal, run "ls -R /" or "ls -R /dev" (you won't
have to wait as long :-).
3. In the second gnome-terminal, simply run "ls" (or just opening a
gnome-terminal window will sometimes cause the same problem).
Actual Results:
The ls in the first gnome-terminal will usually freeze. Neither CTRL+C nor
CTRL+Z will kill the ls process. The gnome-terminal itself is NOT frozen.
Its window menus are still responsive.
Expected Results:
ls should not freeze. The same steps on linux-2.4.20-8 (Redhat 9) do not
freeze ls. Running "ls -R /dev" on linux-2.6.0-test4 before starting X or
GNOME does not freeze ls either. So the problem seems to have something to
do with multiple interactive GNOME processes..?
