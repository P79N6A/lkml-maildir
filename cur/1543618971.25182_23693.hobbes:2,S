    That is: I can include it if I just want the definition of a few
ioctl's, but if in a future version all that is changed or even
dissapears is completely my problem.
    Given the number of user-space apps that needs ioctl definitions
and things like those (that are supposed not to change easily), those
definitions should go in user-includable headers... IMHO.
    Fortunately, we have some of them in libc headers now.
    Thanks,
    Raúl
