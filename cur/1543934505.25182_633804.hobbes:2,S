are you sure -pg really needs this? I just carried this along the years 
and went the path of least resistence, but we should not be 
reintroducing the !REGPARM build mode for the kernel. I'd not be 
surprised if there were a few issues with REGPARM + mcount, but we have 
to figure it out before merging ...
