Hi,
I went from bk4 to bk6. After patching i just typed make to recompile (as I
thought this would be enough). But it errored out because CONFIG_BASE_SMALL
wasn't defined. So I did make menuconfig and saved my config again and now it
compiles through.
Is it needed to run make oldconfig or make menuconfig and save before kernel
upgrade? I thought make oldconfig is run automatically on make?
