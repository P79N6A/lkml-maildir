While I suppose "0" is covered under "the result is unspecified", I
would suggest that EINVAL is a better choice: "The filedes argument
does not refer to a file on which this operation is possible".
The reason being that the normal reason for an extending ftruncate
is so that you can mmap it and not get SIGBUS for accessing past the
end of the file.
