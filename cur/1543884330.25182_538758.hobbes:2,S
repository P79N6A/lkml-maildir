Without a system that really needs the original problem that was being
worked around it's going to be hard to see if the workaround still does
the job.  Given the nature of the failure I wouldn't be surprised if it
broke different things on every board that has problems.
How about a sysfs tuneable?  It's not nice but at least it's runtime.
