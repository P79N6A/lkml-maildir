How can I (as root) pause or suspend a process?
On VAX/VMS one could do `set process=suspend`. This
would allow the system manager to check on a possibly
rogue user.
Let's say that "Hacker Jack" just got fired because
he was disrupting a project. One needs to find any of
his processes where he might be deleting a project
tree. Pausing, rather than killing the tasks would
allow evidence to be gathered. Basically, I need
to set the task(s) priorities to something that
will take them out of the run-queue altogether.
Cheers,
