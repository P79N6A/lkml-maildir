Yes, this "slightly better" patch applied on top of your first patch against 
hda_codec.c did the trick, but with some side-effects:
* the "Speaker" switch now mutes/unmutes speakers
* muting/unmuting "Front" channel now has zero effect (in 2.6.24 it had the 
same effect as the "Speaker" switch now has)
* changing volume on "Front" channel now affects volume in headphones (was not 
so in 2.6.24)
So there are now 3 vol controls that affect both speakers and headphones:
* Master (which appeared somewhere between 2.6.24 and .25-rc1), when set to 
zero, the sound is still audible in speakers and headphones
* PCM, working as expected (0 volume = no sound)
* Front (0 volume = still audible sound)
So it is usable now (and those Speaker and Headphones on/off switches make 
sense), but kinda suboptimal. (is it my BIOS who is to blame?)
Thanks, Matej
