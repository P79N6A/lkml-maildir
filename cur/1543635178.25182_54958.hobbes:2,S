Does it also work in the case where the current shell is csh or tcsh
(for example)? If not, you will need to replace the test for bash with a
test for bash or ksh or ... instead, as otherwise it will still fail.
Certainly on the systems I've used where bash isn't available, tcsh has
been far commoner than ksh.
Best wishes from Riley.
