Hi Dan,

No problem. If you queue this up for another two weeks than I have no
problem with it. I just wanted to make sure that you did not lose it :)

I'm not sure why I haven't seen this myself. crypto/xor.c is the only
user of those defines but linux/raid/xor.h is also included by
async_xor.c which does not use xor_block_pII_mmx & friends. The best
thing would be probably _not_ to merge those two header files like I did
but keep them separate. Maybe we could move this define directly into
crypto/xor.c since it is the only user?
