Hi David,
I don't really want to be chiming in with another 'make it a kiobuf',
but given that you already have written 'do_tcp_sendpages()' why did
you make sock->ops->sendpage() take the single page as an argument
rather than just have it take the 'struct page **'?
I would have thought one of the main interests of doing something like
this would be to allow us to speed up large writes to the socket for
ncpfs/knfsd/nfs/smbfs/...
After all, in both the case of the client WRITE requests and the
server READ responses, we end up with a set of several pages that just
need to be pushed down the network without further ado. Unless I
misunderstood the code, it seems that do_tcp_sendpages() fits the bill
nicely...
Cheers,
  Trond
