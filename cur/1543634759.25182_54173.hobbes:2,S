10 GB is already bad enough that rmap isn't so much causing
a problem but increasing an already untolerable problem.
For the large SHM segment you'd probably want to either use
large pages or shared page tables ... in each of these cases
the rmap overhead will disappear together with the page table
overhead.
Now we just need volunteers for the implementation ;)
kind regards,
Rik
