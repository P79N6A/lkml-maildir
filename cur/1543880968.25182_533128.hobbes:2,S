I have the patchset that I mentioned, but I'm not proposing it for 2.6.21.
It's much too invasive to be introduced in an -rc7, but it does include
locking changes that I believe avoid this bug.
Vladimir was right in his analysis that sometimes get_xa_root() takes the
reference once and other times twice, but not for the right reasons.  I save
a reference to the xattr dir to avoid a lookup later, but when there are multiple
getxattrs or listxattrs as the first xattr operation on the file system, we can end
up taking a second reference when we shouldn't. This is because those operations
are protected by read locks and the ->xattr_root pointer isn't protected by anything
else. A quick fix would be to just extend the protection of the priv root's i_mutex
around the assignment, and test first. The right fix involves a complete rework of
the locking, and I have code to do that, it's just too late to include it in 2.6.21.
I'd love to know what Andrea (and now Andi Kleen) are doing to hit this now. There
haven't been any changes in this code in a while, and the shrink_dcache_for_umount()
has been around since October. I'm unable to reproduce locally so far, so if Andrea
or Andi could see if this fixes it for them, I'd appreciate it.
