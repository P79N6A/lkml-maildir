Subject: [patch] big IRQ lock removal, 2.5.27-F3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

the latest irqremove patch, against 2.5.27-BK-current:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/remove-irqlock-patches/remove-irqlock-2.5.27-F3
Changes:
 - the entry.S cleanups/speedups by Oleg Nesterov.
 - a rather critical synchronize_irq() bugfix: if a driver frees an 
   interrupt that is still being probed then synchronize_irq() locks up.
   This bug has caused a spurious boot-lockup on one of my testsystems,
   ifconfig would lock up trying to close eth0.
 - remove duplicate definitions from asm-i386/system.h, this fixes 
   compiler warnings.
compiles, boots, works just fine.
