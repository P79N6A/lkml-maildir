Hi nick,
The patches that u posted on lkml regarding the vfs scalibility, on
which kernel did u build them.
I tried applying them on 2.6.12-git4, 2.6.12-mm1, mm2, 2.6.12.1, but
to no avail.
Many hunks are failing in each of the patch. I guess when the first is
failing others are
bound to..
Also, i m trying to apply the patches in the following order :
[patch 1] mm: PG_free flag
[patch 2] mm: speculative get_page
[patch 3] radix tree: lookup_slot
[patch 4] radix tree: lockless readside
[patch 5] mm: lockless pagecache lookups
[patch 6] mm: spinlock tree_lock
This sequence is correct....right?
Thanks,
Dave
