That's not really the vfs but the generic pagecache routines.  For some
filesystems (e.g. XFS) only reservations for delayed allocations are
performed in this path so it doesn't really matter.  For not so advanced
filesystems batching these calls would definitly be very helpful.  Patches
to get there are very welcome.
