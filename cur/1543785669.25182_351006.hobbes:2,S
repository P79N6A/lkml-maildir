Essentially that is what happened.  Albert's patch simply fixed it 
another way.
ATA is a bit annoying in that, we try to "know" when an interrupt is 
expected.  There is no 100% solution that simply allows us to check for 
pending interrupts, without side effects.
Thus the explosion when unexpected interrupts are received.
