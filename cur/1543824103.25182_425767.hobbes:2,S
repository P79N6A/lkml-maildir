+Install kexec-tools and the Kdump patch
+---------------------------------------
+
+1) Login as the root user.
+
+2) Download the kexec-tools user-space package from the following URL:
+
+   
http://www.xmission.com/~ebiederm/files/kexec/kexec-tools-1.101.tar.gz
+
+3) Unpack the tarball with the tar command, as follows:
+
+   tar xvpzf kexec-tools-1.101.tar.gz
+
+4) Download the latest consolidated Kdump patch from the following URL:
+
+   
http://lse.sourceforge.net/kdump/
+   
+   (This location is being used until all the user-space Kdump patches
+   are integrated with the kexec-tools package.)
+   
+5) Change to the kexec-tools-1.101 directory, as follows:
+
+   cd kexec-tools-1.101
+
+6) Apply the consolidated patch to the kexec-tools-1.101 source tree
+   with the patch command, as follows. (Modify the path to the downloaded
+   patch as necessary.)
+   
+   patch -p1 < /path-to-kdump-patch/kexec-tools-1.101-kdump.patch
+
+7) Configure the package, as follows:
+
+   ./configure
+
+8) Compile the package, as follows:
+
+   make
Can 1) log in as root
be moved to here?
+9) Install the package, as follows:
+
+   make install
+The dump-capture kernel
+-----------------------
+
+1) Under "General setup," append "-kdump" to the current string in
+   "Local version."
+
+2) On x86, enable high memory support under "Processor type and
+   features":
+
+   CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G=y
+   or
+   CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G
That would be CONFIG_HIGHMEM4B=y
but why is either of these required?
+6) Use a suitable value for "Physical address where the kernel is
+   loaded" (under "Processor type and features"). This only appears when
+   "kernel crash dumps" is enabled. By default this value is 0x1000000
+   (16MB). It should be the same as X in the "crashkernel=Y@X" boot
+   parameter discussed above.
+
+   On x86 and x86_64, use "CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START=0x1000000".
+      
+   On ppc64 the value is automatically set at 32MB when
+   CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP is set.
Two 6)'s.
+6) Optionally enable "/proc/vmcore support" under "Filesystems" ->
+   "Pseudo filesystems".
+
+   CONFIG_PROC_VMCORE=y
+   (CONFIG_PROC_VMCORE is set by default when CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP is selected.)
+
