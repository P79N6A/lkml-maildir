uh, but the pending test is to check for NULL pointers, so while your
change consolidates some code, I don't think it changes anything, unless
you can find a place that calls detach_timer and doesn't clear the
pointers...
For what its worth, my look at this problem seems to indicate that the
new timer pointer is zero.  This would be a problem in the network code
somewhere.  I would guess that the whole structure is being released by
cpu X while cpu y is trying to set up a timer.  But then I don't really
know the network code (at all).  Just going by the error, defer of zero
in add_timer() which only looks at the timer to verify that the pointers
are zero.
