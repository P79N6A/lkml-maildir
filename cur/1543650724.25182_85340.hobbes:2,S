So, you don't like bloat, such as having 22 different file systems (only
including the ones that can be placed on disk, not things like devfs or
smbfs...). That's more filesystems than I have dollars in my wallet at
the moment.   For the amount of utility that this code provides, it's
definately not 'bloat'.

Now this sounds more like something I'd hear from Sun trying to get a fix
for a version of Solaris without having to buy a new one.  I thought the
whole point of Free Software was sharing with the community, and doing
what's best for the community.

That's the same as claiming that George W. Bush is just one person....
So I'll plea yet again, please add LKCD!
