I see this too.  I always thought it was the less-than-perfect ABIT BP6
loosing an irq or something.  (odd that it _always_ is the NIC that goes
though...)  I also have a k6 with the same NIC, and another
UP machine at work.  They never fail this way.
Could it be a SMP problem?

That never helped me - "shutdown -r now" is my way to recovery.
The card driver is compiled in, perhaps I should try 
making it modular and unload/reload.
