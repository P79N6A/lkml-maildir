At this time (when CPU is 100% utilized) the user space process is not getting scheduled even after a long duration (say 10 minutes to 45 minutes). Mean time the message buffer in the device is filled up and the device halts (aka controlled crash; the device firmware has been designed like this) as there is no more memory on the device.

The simple answer is that you made a design mistake.  If the CPU can't
keep up with the data then you picked the wrong cpu for the job.
The more complex answer is that you probably really need a realtime
system where you can set guarenties on the scheduler time for a given
task, even at the expense of the kernel.
On the system I work on we had to make sure the 4 ethernet ports didn't
overload the CPU, and we actually have the ethernet driver check the
system cpu percentage over a small interval and if it goes over a
specified percentage, then the port will stop processing incoming
packets for one jiffy, giving some time for user space tasks.  It's a
bit of an ugly hack, but it sure works well.
