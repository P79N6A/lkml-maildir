It is certainly desirable to run as much as feasibly possible in
userspace.  The only exception of things that could be handled in
userspace but are allowed to live in kernel space would be performance
critical and stable items (say, TCP/IP).
No one said the rngd has to run as root.  For example, run it as nobody
in a random group and give /dev/random write privileges to the random
group.
If userspace equates to insecure, and we stick things in the kernel for
that reason, we are beyond help ...
