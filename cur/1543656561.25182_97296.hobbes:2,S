I'm waiting for the kernel bugzilla to become useful - currently the
record for me has been:
3 bugs total
3 bugs for serial code for drivers I don't maintain, reassigned to mbligh.
This means I write (choose one):
1. non-buggy code (highly unlikely)
2. code no one tests
3. code people do test but report via other means (eg, email, irc)
If it's (3), which it seems to be, it means that bugzilla is failing to
do its job properly, which is most unfortunate.
