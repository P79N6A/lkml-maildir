umm, yeah.  Ingo went a bit over the top there, IMO.
It boils down to: is sys_time() called at more or less than 1/2000th the
frequency of gettimeofday(), across the expected lifetime of 2.6.23 and
later?  Ingo has a couple of (surprising) examples where the sys_time()
call frequency _is_ high, but whether that will remain true across 2.6.23
and later is an open question.
How does mysql call sys_time() at all, if time(2) uses the vsyscall page??
Will contemporary-to-2.6.23-and-later mysqls do this?
All this isn't super-trivial silliness, either.  gettimeofday() is, for
many workloads, the kernel's most time-critical codepath bar none, I
believe.
