Hmm... I guess there isn't.
I remember having a lot of trouble getting partitions to be recognised
when an array is first assembled, and deciding it was just easier to
leave it to user-space.  However that isn't an option when booting
without an initrd.
The following patch should make it work for the
  md=d0,....
case.  The "raid=part" case is a bit harder....
