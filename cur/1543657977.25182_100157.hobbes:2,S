Linearizing a space like this is always a bad idea, I think. 
It would be entirely possible to just add the irq routing information to 
the "struct device" tree, and have a "dev_request_irq(dev, ...)", along 
with a few helper functions like "pci_request_irq(pci_dev, ...)".
And the old "request_irq()" would just use the system root device as the 
device.
