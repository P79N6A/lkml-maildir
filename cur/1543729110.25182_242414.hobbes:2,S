S'alright.

Have you guys run the LSB tests on some PPC with hw floating point (is
that what you mean by 'matches the hardware behavior' ?) to see if the
test also passes there as-is?  And does anyone object to this patch?
Now that 2.6.8.1 is out I'm gonna start committing in a bunch of stuff
I've had queued up and see if I can get Linus to pull.  Thanks.
