In the case where you introduced panic_gently() there is IMHO no reason
to panic() at all. There is no bug which got hit, the machine just needs
user intervention because of wrong boot parameters (in most cases).
What about asking the user for the correct root= or init= parameters
and just retry/continue the boot process?
The 180seconds reboot timeout also doesn't make sense here. The problem
won't go away after a reboot without user interaction.
