I just got a nice XFS oops due to the direct_IO API change in
2.4.  Guys, this is a STABLE series and APIs are supposed to be exactly
that, _STABLE_.  If you really think O_DIRECT on NFS is soo important
please add a ->direct_IO2 for NFS like the reiserfs read_inode2 hack.
But what's the use of it anyway?  AFAIK it's mostly for whoracle setups
that have their data on netapps but that needs a certified vendor kernel
not mainline..
