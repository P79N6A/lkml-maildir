Subject: [patch] typo in i386 machine check code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Our old PIII Xeons are dying, as shown by more frequent panics
due to bad hardware:
    kernel: CPU 3: Machine Check Exception: 0000000000000007 
    kernel: Bank 0: b678600022000800 at 3678600022000800 
The part after the "at" is supposed to be the memory address which
was being accessed when the fault was detected.  Instead the code
prints out the status field again (with the high bit removed for
no apparent reason).
Patch is against 2.5.2.
