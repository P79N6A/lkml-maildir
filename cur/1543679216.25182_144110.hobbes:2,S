not if the file-system is read-only by design (eg: romfs or anything like that)
or a read-only directory in /proc. To be honnest, I have another patch which
allows any process to chroot to /proc/self/empty. I know that it's not good
when the root is compromized. The attacker could do other things and even halt
the system. That's not what I'm trying to fight against. I'm only trying to
stop proliferation, and isolate the attacker into a place where the only tools
he can use are the ones he codes himself on the heap or stack, which is rather
limitating.
Cheers,
Willy
