Hi Greg, Kenji-san,
This is v10 of my "introduce pci_slot" series, to be considered
for inclusion in linux-next to get more test exposure and shake
out the bugs.

New in v10 is the addition of a DMI list to do the right thing on
Fujitsu hardware, and does not rely on "don't load the module" to
get the correct behavior.
Also, v10 should fix the "pci_slot module changes the sysfs name"
issue that Kenji-san was seeing.

Thanks, I'd like to know if the naming issue is fixed for you as
well.
cheers,
