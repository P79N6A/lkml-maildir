Maybe - it's a lowly 2.6GHz P4 with 1GB RAM, ICH5, and SATA disk.

It will certainly improve the situation significantly, and pick up
on some non-ARM problems like (badge4_defconfig, since 2.6.24-git2):
drivers/built-in.o: In function `v4l2_i2c_attach':
drivers/media/video/v4l2-common.c:1035: undefined reference to `i2c_attach_client'
Currently, the defconfigs known to fail (long term) in Linus' tree
are clps7500_defconfig and trizeps4_defconfig - the former I'm tempted
to remove, the latter seems to be because the PCMCIA changes were lost
on the linux-pcmcia list and the trizeps folk have probably given up.
