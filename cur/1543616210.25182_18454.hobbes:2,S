I'm having some problems creating a large filesystem on linux kernels
2.4.17.  I am using Debian Potato with Adrian Bunk's updates for 
running 2.4.  The filesystem is approx. 260GB and is on an AMI MegaRAID
RAID-5 stripe.

Can anyone shed some light on this?  I'd be happy to provide more info if it
is needed.  CC's appreciated.  I'm going to try downgrading the kernel to an
older version and see if that helps.
Thanks,
