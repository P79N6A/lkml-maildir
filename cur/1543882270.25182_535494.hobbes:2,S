No. I'm really suggesting improving the translation from BIO's 
to the page cache.  A set of helper functions.
This patch is suggesting we move to a BSD like buffer cache, except
that everything is physically mapped.
My most practical suggestion is to have support code so that you can
do all of the locking (that I/O cares about) on the first page of a
page group in the page cache.  You don't need larger physical pages to
do that.

Agreed the page cache is all about variable sized objects known as files!
You don't need to do anything extra.  The problem is only with building
I/O requests from what is there.
Iff we really the larger physical page size to support the hardware
then it makes sense to go down a path of larger pages.  But it doesn't.
There is also a more fundamental reasons this patch is silly.  It assumes
that there is a trivial mapping between filesystems (the primary target
of the page cache and blocks on disk).  Now I admit this is common but
there is no reason to supposed it is true, and this patch appears to
exacerbate things.
