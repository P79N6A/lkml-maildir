This was hashed through on the list about a year back.  You might try googling 
next time...
This is actually standards compliant behaviour, as silly as it sounds.  However,
if you want stricter arp behaviour, and are using source-based routing, the 
following will fix it.
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/arp_filter
Here is an example setup on 2.4.18:
# ip add
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP> mtu 16436 qdisc noqueue
     link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
     inet 127.0.0.1/8 brd 127.255.255.255 scope host lo
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 100
     link/ether 00:30:65:bf:46:ba brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
     inet 47.129.82.58/24 brd 47.129.82.255 scope global eth0
3: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 100
     link/ether 00:50:ff:90:04:44 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
     inet 47.129.82.107/24 brd 47.129.82.255 scope global eth1
# ip ru
0:      from all lookup local
32764:  from 47.129.82.107 lookup 101
32765:  from 47.129.82.58 lookup 100
32766:  from all lookup main
32767:  from all lookup 253
# ip ro
47.129.82.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 47.129.82.58
47.129.82.0/24 dev eth1  proto kernel  scope link  src 47.129.82.107
127.0.0.0/8 dev lo  scope link
default via 47.129.82.1 dev eth0
# ip ro li table 100
47.129.82.0/24 dev eth0  scope link
default via 47.129.82.1 dev eth0
# ip ro li table 101
47.129.82.0/24 dev eth1  scope link
default via 47.129.82.1 dev eth1
With this setup, arp requests for 47.129.82.58 will only be answered by eth0,
and similarly for 47.129.82.107 and eth1.
