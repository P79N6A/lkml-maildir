I once used a printk in the keyboard irq handler to check a 
nonstandard keyboard.  You may put a printk() in the timer interrupt
handler.  
That should show that the irq handler works.  Of course you don't want
to
run such a log-filler for long... :-)
Maybe you can get the machine to boot by skipping the bogomips
calculation completely - by hardcoding the value your machine used to 
come up with?
Not for production use - just to get a debugging kernel going.
