If you have an 'old' sys-V installation, you as root can execute
`init 0`. Then, after everything has stopped, you can execute
`init 5` or `init 6` to restart to the runlevel you had. More
modern versions from (probably all) distributions won't allow
this. But... you may be able to make a script. The problem is
in fooling init to start all over again. You really need to modify
init (perhaps runlevel 10) to, after everything is unmounted and
all the gettys are killed, do:
	char *argv[3];
        argv[0] ="/sbin/init";
        argv[1] ="auto";
        argv[2] = NULL;
        execve(argv[0], argv, __environ);
That will overlay and restart init from scratch.
Cheers,
