I've looked at the mm diff :
http://www.kernel.org/diff/diffview.cgi?file=
%2Fpub%2Flinux%2Fkernel%2Fpeople%2Fakpm%2Fpatches%2F2.6%2F2.6.9-rc1%2F2.6.9-rc1-mm4%2F2.6.9-rc1-mm4.bz2;z=2689
there's a trace of this problem...
I also get a kernel source from scratch, with the following command :
tar jxf linux-2.6.8.1.tar.bz2
cd linux-2.6.8.1
bunzip2 -c ~/patch-2.6.9-rc1.bz2 | patch -p1
bunzip2 -c ~/2.6.9-rc1-mm4.bz2 | patch -p1
the typo is at its place.
BR,
