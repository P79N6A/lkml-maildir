I agree, we must make these devices work.  But when your dealing with
odd devices, that violate the spec in random ways, and you don't have
documentation on how these devices are broken, and you aren't getting
paid to provide support for these devices, development can be a bit slow
at times.  And because of these factors, we will almost always lag
behind the OSes that manufacturers directly support.

I didn't say that it was "3.0 material", you did.
What is pretty major is the core device model.  Lots of driver api
changes and cleanups have happened in 2.5.  It's almost starting to look
sane in places :)
