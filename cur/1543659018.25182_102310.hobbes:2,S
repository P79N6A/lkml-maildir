Move the help text from CONFIG_M386 entry to the choice entry. I didn't
do this automatically since often the help text has to splitted
manually. It's on my TODO list, but I still hope someone else would like
to do this. :)
BTW menuconfig will only show the general help text. Showing the
individual help text entries would require changing lxdialog, what I
tried to avoid so far (so it's even lower on my TODO list).
bye, Roman
