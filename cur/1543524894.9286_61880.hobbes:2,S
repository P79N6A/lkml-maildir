Dear Linus and the World,
I noticed a new interesting bootloader in arch/ia64 and the desire to turn
my simple BCP into a full-featured inkernel ELF bootloader for IA32 is
almost vanished (unless someone says it's worth it).
Therefore, maybe you could consider BCP for what it is worth at present
- a universal (i.e. bootloader-independent) way to dump/set kernel command
line at boot time?
Here is the updated patch for 2.3.43-pre2:

Regards,
Tigran.
