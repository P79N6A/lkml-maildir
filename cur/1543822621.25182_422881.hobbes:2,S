You could be right. The only thing I am certain is rt20 related is those
"stops" we are also talking about in complete-preempt mode. I can only
say for sure that These BUGs are not seen using a 2.4.13.4 kernel. That
kernel and this app are considered stable to me. All else is fair game.

Here is a detailed list of the RT tasks running with prios, cpu masks
etc. There are 3 nics. eth1 is the nic being used by the emulation. eth2
is currently unused.

Ok I have this but it is 2000+ lines. I probably don't want to put it on
the list. Should I send it to you directly?

The aic7xxx controllers are both connected to external legacy scsi
racks. eth1, eth2, and the aix7xxx cards are in an SBS pci expansion
chassis. The 3 gpiohsd and the 1 eprm cards are also in the expansion
rack but are not being used at all in this.
I'll send the sysreq data when I get it.
