Subject: [PATCH][SELINUX] Remove hardcoded policy assumption from get_user_sids logic
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/4/20/76

This patch against 2.6.6-rc1-mm1 removes a hardcoded policy assumption
from the get_user_sids logic in the SELinux module that was preventing
it from returning contexts that had the same type as the caller even if
the policy allowed such a transition.  The assumption is not valid for
all policies, and can be handled via policy configuration and userspace
rather than hardcoding it in the module logic.
