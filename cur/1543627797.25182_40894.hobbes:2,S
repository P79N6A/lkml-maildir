Hi,
I have a SIS 315 connected to a TV using it in PAL mode.
The driver produces kernel oopses sometimes, especially when
doing mode and VT switches. Also the TV out is broken for
some resolutions. I can do more testing and give you more
details if you want.
I am willing to test new driver versions and am also thinking
about writing an accelerated driver for DirectFB.
