Thanks, Tom. I suspect that NUMA has issues of its own in this area. I 
always set up the kernel buffer size and run dmesg with -s200000 or so 
on machines which tend to be overly verbose.
I leave it to someone really expert to figure out how to tell the actual 
number of sockets, cores, and siblings. I think the system scheduler may 
want this info, but I certainly don't intend to start 2nd guessing the 
kernel on this stuff. The current scheduler does a pretty good job of 
handling HT now, I'm not about to try and do better.
Interesting thought, I believe the IBM chip for PS not only has many 
cores, but one article said they were not all the same. That, and 
thoughts of someone running an SMP system with chips having 
non-identical sibling count make me glad someone else is doing the 
scheduler.
