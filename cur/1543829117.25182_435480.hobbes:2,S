It allows the user to specify an arbitrary 8 or
16 bit repeating pattern on the transmit data pin between
HDLC frames.
In most cases the idle pattern is continuous
ones or flags as supported by off the shelf
synchronous controllers and defined in the ISO3309 standard.
Some applications (radio/satellite modems, connections to
legacy military hardware) require non-standard patterns.
