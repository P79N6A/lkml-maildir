Hm. But can't we do better? Looks like we don't need to check ->current_work,
	void cancel_rearming_delayed_work(struct delayed_work *dwork)
	{
		struct work_struct *work = &dwork->work;
		struct cpu_workqueue_struct *cwq = get_wq_data(work);
		int done;
		do {
			done = 1;
			spin_lock_irq(&cwq->lock);
			if (!list_empty(&work->entry))
				list_del_init(&work->entry);
			else if (test_and_set_bit(WORK_STRUCT_PENDING, work_data_bits(work)))
				done = del_timer(&dwork->timer)
			spin_unlock_irq(&cwq->lock);
		} while (!done);
		/*
		 * Nobody can clear WORK_STRUCT_PENDING. This means that the
		 * work can't be re-queued and the timer can't be re-started.
		 */
		needs_a_good_name(cwq->wq, work);
		work_clear_pending(work);
	}
Jarek, I didn't think much about this, just a new idea. I am posting this code
in a hope you can review it while I sleep on this... CPU-hotplug is ignored for
now. Note that this version doesn't need the change in run_workqueue().
Oleg.
