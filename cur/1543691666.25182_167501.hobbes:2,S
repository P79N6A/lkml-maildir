That's clear then, however, some kernel process/procedure must have tried 
to allocate a huge block of memory.

The suggestion from Marc-Christian Petersen <m.c.p@wolk-project.de>,
namely using v2.4.23-pre5, worked for me. I was not sure before,
because I was not able to guess from the Changelog whether there 
was a fix for the particular bug. My suggestion is that the log entry
below describes the bug fix for it:
Summary of changes from v2.4.22 to v2.4.23-pre1
============================================
...
Marc-Christian Petersen:
  o Cleanup kmem_cache_reap()
or was it related to this one:
  o Avoid potentially leaking pagetables into the per-cpu queues
I hope that it was also fixed in 2.6, or is there a different mechanism
used?
Best regards,
 Roland
