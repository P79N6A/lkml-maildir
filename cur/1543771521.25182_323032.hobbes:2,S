Lindent got me here. I didn't doublecheck its munging on this file.
Updated that.

This may seem silly but I was trying to have the automagic DocBook
stuff pick up the complete set of kernel interfaces without have
to duplicate anything in the DocBook template.  Since these functions
are macro-generated I could have a comment block for each one that
the docs stuff would pick up.  So, I put rio_local_*() up in
include/linux/rio_drv.h as inline wrappers around these implementations.
Too ugly to live? Maybe there's a better way to make this work, it
would nice to have it autogenerate the docs.

Good point. I'm going to go through and make all RIO interfaces
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(). Embedded folks need the extra encouragement
to do the right thing when writing drivers.

I see that in the current git tree.  I think some of it applies (note
that RIO is a big-endian system, not surprising since it originates
from Motorola/Fscale), I'll look more closely and add the appropriate
fixes into the next patch.  Since Andrew took these into -mm I will
just post patches against -mm.

Heh, yes.  The "maintenance packets" that are used to access config
space on RIO devices have a 21-bit offset field.  I guess the
spec guys didn't want to run out of config space too quickly. :)
