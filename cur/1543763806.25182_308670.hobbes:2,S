Yes, to a certain extent.  usb-handoff causes the whole notebook to lock
up at the next reboot (as in it doesn't even come up with the BIOS
splash screen).  The only way to recover from that is to disconnect all
power from the notebook, leave it for a couple of seconds, reconnect and
only then can you go on.  It does however help with the whole
touchpad/keyboard problem (can't remember whether it fixes the keyboard
requires usb-1.1 or the AUX problem).
