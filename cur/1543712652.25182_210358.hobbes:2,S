Regression on what workload? The 2.4 kernel who did the
early balancing didn't seem to have problems.
I have NUMA API for an application to select memory placement
manually, but it's unrealistic to expect all applications to use it,
so the scheduler has to do at least an reasonable default.
In general on Opteron you want to go as quickly as possible
to your target node. Keeping things on the local node and hoping
that threads won't need to be balanced off is probably a loss.
It is quite possible that other systems have different requirements,
but I doubt there is a "one size fits all" requirement and 
doing a custom domain setup or similar would be fine for me.
(or at least if sched domain cannot be tuned for Opteron then
it would have failed its promise of being a configurable scheduler)

I can try such tests if they're not too time consuming to set up.
What did you have in mind?
