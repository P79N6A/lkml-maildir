well this is a work box. I do coding, yes, but this is perl, php, etc,
mostly (99%) on remote machines. The big apps running here is mozilla,
openoffice, korganzier (yes I do the KDE bloat) and _a_ _lot_ of konsole
~ (kde terminals).
I want responsivness. I don't want to wait 10s to switch between virtual
desktops. I compile a kernel once in a while. Very rare actually,
because this is a work box and I don't reboot all the time (can't &
don't want). The last kernel change was 64d ago.

well the only thing that needs disk over and over again is this _crappy_
gentoo because it needs to compile everything. I really hate myself for
using it, because _this_ probably screws up _all_ the page cache, etc.

well, to be honest, I doubt it is so bloated anymore. I think gnome is
the better bloat of those two.

well, if you call xemacs (the editor without an OS) lean ... *hmm* but I
am a vim man after all ;)
