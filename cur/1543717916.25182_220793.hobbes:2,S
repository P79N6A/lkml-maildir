Subject: Linux 2.6.6 appears to be 3 to 4 times slower than 2.6.5.

I have memory benchmarks and compile benchmarks,
essentially
compiling takes ~5 sec on a 2.53ghz (533mhz bus/2GB ram box) for lilgp - 
genetic program
ram  =ddr 333
compiling takes ~15-20 sec on a 3ghz (not sure on bus/4gb ram box) for lilgp 
- genetic program
ram = ddr 400
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/ramdisk/file bs=409e size=(64 or 256mb)
it is 12% faster on the slower (2.53ghz box) vs the box w/DDR 400mhz ram
Is anyone else having SERIOUS PROBLEMS with the 2.6.6 kernel as well?
