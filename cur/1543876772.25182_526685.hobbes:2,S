we're also having problems reproducing it on that same combination (2.6.21-rc4 + 
my tree), so it points to something in -mm. Since your trace is completely 
different right now it looks like something else is fuzzing it up.
Since the e1000 changes are in rc5-mm3 as well, that might help to narrow it 
down quickly.
