Ok, you win.  Next time I get scare, I should ask you first. :)
In a single picture, links currently look like this:
Symlink		can point to inodes or cowlinks or hardlinks
Hardlink	can point to inodes or cowlinks
Cowlink		can point to inodes
I like it.
Not sure about the current count, but it looks like most people favor
the indirect approach now.
