Subject: [BUG?] 2.6.0-test5-mm[1,2], CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND=y, qconf and swapon -a

I've recently discovered a bug in the swsusp code in 2.6.0-test5-mm[1,2].
When CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND=y, and the kernel is first started, doing a
swapon -a livelocks the machine (i.e. bootup stops, but Alt-SysRQ works fine).
I don't use swsusp and I don't want to at this time, and the swap partition
swapon was trying to activate is an ordinary 659MB swap partition (version 1,
priority -1) at the end of the disk.
qconf doesn't allow you to set CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND=n, and modifying .config
doesn't work either (it gets set back to y). According to the range/data values
in qconf, there actually is no way to disable swsusp in 2.6.0-test5-mm[1,2].
Interesting part of .config:
#
# Power management options (ACPI, APM)
#
CONFIG_PM=y
CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND=y
# CONFIG_PM_DISK is not set
CONFIG_PM_DISK_PARTITION=""
What should I try now?
TIA
