Hmmm. The task list is read-locked by a whole lot of procedures,
including do_SAK(). Or kill_fasync() by way of send_sigio().
A few other places come to mind, but kill_fasync() definitely is the
killer for your proposed patch.
I would say that forbidding to send signals from interrupt (or BH) context
is a Very Bad Thing.
