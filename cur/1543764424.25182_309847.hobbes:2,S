OK, good thanks for testing that. I'll send it to Andrew.

Yeah, that is true. OTOH it is a bit of a special case, and our
multiprocessor scheduling in general practically shuts down when
we have a situation with a single queue with a lot of pinned tasks.
What did I have for MAX_PINNED_INTERVAL? ~1second. I guess that could
come down a bit - maybe 1/4 or 1/2 a second? I think it is a "good
enough for now" kind of situation.
