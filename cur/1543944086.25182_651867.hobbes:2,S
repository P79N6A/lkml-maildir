I suspect if this was wrong before it would not have been noticed
because user space hwclock would work around it. The warning
certainly won't hurt.
Anyways if you feel strongly about this (I don't) then drop
this patch, but apply the other ones in the series. The main
one I consider important is the change to the 2000 offset for 32bit
to extend the 32bit lifetime.
