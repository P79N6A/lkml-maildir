Subject: [PATCH 1/2] selinux: don't enable minimum mmap checking by default
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/28/149

Don't enable minimum mmap checking by default in SELinux, as it may break
existing applications which do not have updated policy.
We will be able to enable it by default later, once we have code to handle
new permissions which are not present in the user's policy.

This is an updated version of the patch, essentially a reverting an 
earlier patch which I'll drop once this are settles down.
