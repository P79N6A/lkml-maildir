This is exactly the kind of hook we've tried to avoid.  This is really
asking for permission to alter inode attribute data.  This type of
hook is incomplete because there are other ways to alter this data,
and this access is already controlled by the inode_setattr hook (as
Tony mentioned).  So this is a no go.
