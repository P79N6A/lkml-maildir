Is there any performance degradation when using ACPI as it uses IRQ 9,
therefore forcing more devices to share IRQ's thus possibly decreasing
performance?

Well, I can't tell for sure... ACPI is supposed to offer better power
management and battery usage for laptops, while being more flexible than
APM.
The truth is that on my laptop, both work equally well but since ACPI is
still less mature than APM, I chose to use ACPI in order to test it and
helping in its future development.

I wouldn't mind about IRQ's...
