So far as I know (which isn't very far ;), that's ok.
Can you explain to me how this will visibly affect users?
Under what conditions, with what kernel configurations or options
selected or not, and with what permissions settings, would they notice
any difference, before and after this patch, in the behaviour of
cpusets, such as when they do the operation of writing a pid to tasks
file that invokes kernel/cpuset.c:attach_task()?
