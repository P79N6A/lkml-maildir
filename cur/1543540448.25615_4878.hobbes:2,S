hello.
sorry for may be stupid question, but for me it's really interesting.
for instance if i have 64 mb of ram and 20mb used for buffer
cache(swap=0), when i try to load netscape instead of decreasing size of
buffer cache kernel
begin to use swap. I don't understand what is a reason for not
decreasing
size of buffer cache.
i hope somebody will answer :))
thank u.
