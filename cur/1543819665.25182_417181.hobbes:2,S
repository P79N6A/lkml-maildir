We've avoided it.  But I think we could change the rules.

It looks OK from a quick read (but the code duplication is saddening)

No.  ->mapping can be set to NULL by truncate.   That's why everyone does
	get_page(page);
	lock_page(page);
	if (page->mapping == NULL)
		someone_just_truncated_this_page();
But truncate doesn't alter ->index.  And I think we can assume that.

Yes, that could get involved.

tree_lock will stabilise ->index, yes.
But I think we'd be OK assuming that ->index is stable.  Although that may
break if splice() is concurrently pulling the page out of pagecache and
stuffing it into a pipe.
