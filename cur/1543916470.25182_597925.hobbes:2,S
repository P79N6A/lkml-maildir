Does your network switch support flowcontrol?  The Yukon-EC may have
a hardware problem that happens if FIFO gets full. If flow control is enabled,
that shouldn't happen. 
The newest version of the driver has a watchdog to try
and detect and do an automatic reset, but it still means there would be about
2 seconds of downtime.
