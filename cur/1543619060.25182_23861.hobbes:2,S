Thank you kindly, Daniel.  It's strange that register 95 is ommitted.  We
definitely can conclude that register 55 is not the one to set on the
kt266 motherboards (whereas on the other via motherboards it *is* the one
to set...  I even have the spec sheet to prove it! :) )
I really wish VIA were more willing to cooperate with us and give us spec
sheets.  It's to their advantage to have us make their buggy motherboards
work well with linux, for crying out loud!  I really don't get what the
big deal is.  I mean it's not like the concept of setting bytes on a pci
device to change functionality is so revolutionary it deserves to be
obfuscated...
