Actually this is not strange to me. It has become obvious that the problems 
with interactivity that have evolved in 2.5 are not scheduler related. Just 
try plugging in all the old 2.4 O(1) scheduler settings into the current 
scheduler and you will see that it still performs badly. What exactly is the 
cause is a mystery but seems to be more a combination of factors with a 
careful look at the way the vm behaves being part of that.  However, as has 
been evident, evolving the interactivity estimation in the scheduler by 
whatever means is able to help, which is why I started on this project in the 
first place. 
I make no apologies for the fact my changes so far have made it feel slower at 
starting applications under load (your mileage may vary depending on hardware 
or whatever as no doubt MCP's experience seems bad) when other very obvious 
limitations abound in the performance in other areas. I have addressed each 
and every issue I could find along the way and this issue is a tweaking one, 
not an infrastructure change, unless other kernel areas are radically changed 
(as in -wli) which appears increasingly unlikely as 2.6 final approaches.
