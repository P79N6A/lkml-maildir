Subject: [PATCH] fix console change race exposed by CFS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/29/105

From: Jan Lübbe <jluebbe@lasnet.de>
The new behaviour of CFS exposes a race which occurs if a switch is
requested when vt_mode.mode is VT_PROCESS.
The process with vc->vt_pid is signaled before vc->vt_newvt is set. This
causes the switch to fail when triggered by the monitoing process
because the target is still -1.
