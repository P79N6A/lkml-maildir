These are expensive debugging options, which walk the inode/block bitmaps
for getting the group inode/block usage instead of using the group
summary data.  Not used very often but I suspect occasionally useful for
developers mucking with ext[23] internals.  Since it is developer-only
code it needs to be enabled with #define CONFIG_EXT[23]_CHECK in a
header or compile option.
Cheers, Andreas
