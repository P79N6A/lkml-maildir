   This half-assed back-out from bk current makes it work here, Arnaldo
   could you please fix this??
This is a good clue, thanks for tracking it down this far.
I'll help figure out what's wrong, I can reproduce the problem
here too.
I believe the problem has something to do with changing when the
rtnetlink/netlink init runs, not the socket owner stuff.
