David mentioned that you could solve the problem by using *rp_filter and
source routing. I don't think that's entirely true, but doing so has the
same drawbacks and breaks the same things as a flag to make Linux behave
like Sun/BSD/Windows (and work with Cisco is the cases previously
mentioned).

Yes, that's exactly the point, the way Linux works has bad effects on
certain other machines, as in leaves them disconnected to the Linux
system.

I don't think anyone is asking for a change in the default behaviour
(although my point about breaking modules does apply), people would be
satisfied, even ecstatic, if we had a simple way (flag) to set to make
Linux work without setting /proc filters, using arpfilter, applying source
routes (David's suggestion) and generally jumping through hoops.
