A user will only see printks if he sits at the console (=> desktop
machine) and there is no X running that has grabbed the graphics board (=>
not a desktop machine). You see the contradiction? :-)

This is impossible to do in X, even if someone wanted to (I doubt someone
would add OS specific code to "fix" users who have no idea how to add
 enough swapspace to their systems), as "X doesn't start
 programs. Programs start programs" (pun indented).
What *could* be done is the infamous swapond that creates new swap areas
in the filesystem on demand.
