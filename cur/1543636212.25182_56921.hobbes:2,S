Okay, again. It's about doing a second close() in case the first one fails 
with EAGAIN. If we have to do it again, the filehandle is not closed, and 
if the filehandle is not closed, the kernel knows that, and if the kernel 
knows that the filehandle is still open, it won't get reassigned. Problem 
gone.
