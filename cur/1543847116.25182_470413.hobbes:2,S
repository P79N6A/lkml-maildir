Thanks for the information.
I have another quick question: my device driver can expect up to 4
different interrupts (from 4 hardware devices). Can I send a posix
real-time signal (SIGRTMIN) using the kill_async interface and expect
the kernel to queue these signals for delievery to the sleeping
process? (Because if I use SIGIO it is possible that an incoming
interrupt is lost because the kernel doesn't queue up normal signals,
right?).
Thanks,
G.Sibi
