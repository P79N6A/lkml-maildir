Hi all,
After fixing (quite a few) problems, and after adding most Debian patches,
it's time for me to recommend you all to look at:
	<
http://www.pi.se/blox/modutils/modutils-snap990302.tar.gz>
There might be some more Debian patches added, and some documentation
updates, otherwise I think it is done...
For example, I think that "modprobe -r" now is usable for crontab
to clean up "autoclean"-able modules while still performing the
pre-/post-remove commands in /etc/conf.modules.
Prove me wrong!
