I trigger a rebinding of the device to the driver in an init file:
# echo -n [device] >/sys/.../bind

I don't think that would be a real fix. You've done away with the
kernel blocking, but the timeout is still there, only that in the
background, and my point is still true: it is useless to wait at
all if userspace didn't receive the event. Waiting asynchronously
is less annoying than waiting synchronously, but equally useless.
