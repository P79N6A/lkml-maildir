Listen, what I'm saying is that your suggested change will only help in
one specific scenario, and simply having inotify used on the 'wrong'
mountpoint will get you back to square one. So, your suggestion isn't
really a solution, but a way of avoiding the real problem. What I *am*
suggesting is that a real fix be found, instead of your hack.
