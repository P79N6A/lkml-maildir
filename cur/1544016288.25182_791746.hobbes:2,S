And we can change that interface if it's not the right one, or perhaps
extend it.  After all, you are are proposing extending that interface;
just in a really horrible, hackish way.

Actually, I would believe the right answer is adding a new resource
limit which can be set using the standard getrlimit()/setrlimit()
interface, and then have apache use this standard interface as a way
of configuring itself --- much like how a process can change other
resource limits, such as the number of file descriptors it has open,
etc.  And if what you want to do is simply make the process volunteer
to be one of the first processes shot by the OOM killer, the apache
process wouldn't even need setuid privileges to lower the "OOM
protection" resource limit.
I think this is cleaner than echoing a magic value to
/proc/self/oom_adj, and it won't be the first time various open source
programs have been changed to take advantage of Linux-specific
interfaces, especially if there's no other standard way of doing
things --- and an extension of BSD's getrlimit()/setrlimit() is
natural and makes a lot of sense.  Heck, apache has been changed to
take advantage of Linux's epoll interface....
