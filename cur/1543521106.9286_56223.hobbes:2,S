Yes, so Linux can handle this if you have the source code. Now, this is
not always the case. So if I have a pre-compiled program (commercial
product, that is) that happens to use malloc() and not mmap(), I in fact
have a system which only allows me 910MB per process.
I believe this can be improved radically. Let the heap grow upwards but
the mmap are grow downwards! Voila, you can allocate up to 3GB of heap OR
3GB of mmap! This is how Solaris handles the problem, by the way.
