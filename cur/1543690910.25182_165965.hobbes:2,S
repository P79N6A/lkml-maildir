Why not just do it in userspace? A program which does nothing more than
spawn a child and wait for it to terminate, performing some action based on
the kind and status of exit, should be fairly trivial?
Admittedly, it might need some shoehorning into some existing setups (i.e.,
where the daemon you wish to watch isn't started directly, but by something
else), but it wouldn't be too tricky, I'd've thought.
[See wait(2), specifically the bits about how to interpret `status']
