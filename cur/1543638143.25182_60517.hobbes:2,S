G'day,
sorry about the delay, I had to deal with a major drama in the day job.

Actually, it's not innocent at all, the documentation does not allow
the construction "define_tristate CONFIG_FOO $CONFIG_BAR".  The last
argument has to be a tristate literal, one of "y" "m" or "n".  It might
look ok but that's because you're thinking shell not config language.
Remember, config language is *not* shell.
The relevant section from Documentation/kbuild/config-language.txt is:

If you're trying to do what I think you're trying to do, the correct
construct is this:
dep_mbool ' Tranparent ...' CONFIG_ZISOFS $CONFIG_ISO9660_FS
if [ "$CONFIG_ZISOFS" = "y" ]; then
    if [ "$CONFIG_ISO9660_FS" = "y" ]; then
	define_tristate CONFIG_ZISOFS_FS y
    else
	define_tristate CONFIG_ZISOFS_FS m
    fi
else
   define_tristate CONFIG_ZISOFS_FS n
fi
If it's any consolation, you're not the only one to get it wrong.

Ah.  I had reproduced your other problem differently, with this:
mainmenu_option next_comment
comment 'xconfig needs this menu'
tristate 'Set this symbol to ON' CONFIG_FOO
dep_tristate 'this is a dep_tristate' CONFIG_BAR $CONFIG_FOO m
endmenu
Open the menu, set FOO=m, save, kaboom.  Your patch fixes that.
