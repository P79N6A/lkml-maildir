I hesitate to call it a device driver bug, because that was likely the
best decision Gerard could make at the time.
However, I think the driver (only going by your description) would be
more correct to use a pointer to struct pci_dev.  We have a token in the
kernel that is guaranteed 100% unique to any given PCI device:  the
pointer to its struct pci_dev.

Sorry, not pci_domain, just system bus number, for any bus, like we
talked about in the previous discussion.
