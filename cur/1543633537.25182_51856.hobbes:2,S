It's a stupid discussion - I added support for filenames containing a ',', 
but the only remaining user is 53c7,8xx.c. That one is broken by the BIO 
changes anyway, and I heard people say it should go away, as the 
hardware is supported by other drivers. So I'll wait and see, if it 
doesn't get fixed but removed, I think removing the hacks to support ',' 
in the filename is the way to go.

Well, let me rephrase it as "foo,bar.c" and "foo:bar.c" ;). kbuild-2.5
would break. Of course it's fixable with even more workarounds, but that's
not the point.

Rusty knows that the current build system can support KBUILD_OBJECT (which 
is what you called it, not KBUILD_OBJECTNAME) just fine - it's a three 
line diff, but I don't see a point in submitting it as long as nobody uses 
it.
