pci_disable_enabled_device() is not called for the PCIe port driver, because
it has the legacy PM support.
What happens is
pci_pm_suspend(port) ->
 		pci_legacy_suspend(port) ->
 		 		pcie_portdrv_suspend(port) [this doesn't save the state]
 		 		pci_save_state(port)
and then, with interrupts off
pci_pm_suspend_noirq(port) ->
 		pci_legacy_suspend_late(port) ->
 		 		pcie_portdrv_suspend_late(port) ->
 		 		 		pci_save_state(port)
and I suspect this last pci_save_state() breaks things.  I'm not sure why,
though.
Thanks,
