OK; that simplifies things for me, good!  I can discard that patch
(broken by Andi's pcspkr change anyway), stop worring about whether
most folk will even see that driver, and make time to look at the
ACPI hooks for RTC wakeup, instead.  :)
But it would be nice to see the PNP bus infrastructure upgraded in
various ways too, now that its availability is less iffy.
 - Add something analagous to platform_driver_probe() so that the
   init code can be removed after it runs.
 - Add shutdown() calls to the PNP bus.  Otherwise e.g. one must
   use shutdown notifiers for PNP interfaces, while normal driver
   model code works for other interfaces to such hardware.
Transitioning from "legacy" drivers to PNP (for PCs) and platform_bus
(other platforms) is a bit awkward because of differences like those.
Drivers still need too many different modes; it's too complicated to
have a core with different bus glues as thin veneers ... the glue must
be thicker (and thus error prone).  Similarly, I/O space resource
reservation acts differently.
I can hope that having PNPACPI be more common will start nudging
more drivers to get rid of their "legacy" modes, or at least focus
on "Real Driver" modes that don't involve poking at hardware and
hoping it doesn't bite back.  ;)
