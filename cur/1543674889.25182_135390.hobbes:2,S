Agree, until that becomes a problem I don't see a reason to rip it out
of SCSI.

:)
I really think this should be handled in the SCSI layer. You are dealing
with devices hanging off a hardware unit of some sort.
It's also possible to go too far with this whole abstraction deal. The
resulting code ends up being contorted, instead of having to separate
'straight forward' cases in SCSI and XYZ (for instance).

Hmmm yes. Now we are moving into general device management, though.

Alright, so what do you need? Start out with X tags, shrink to Y (based
on repeated queue full conditions)? Anything else?
