(Note, I didn't want this for a "binary only" module.  I just want to
be able to compile a module exactly _once_, not once for each
workstation I administer.)
DEBUG_SPINLOCKS is a red herring.  You just don't use DEBUG_SPINLOCKS
on production machines, and on a one-off test compile it's fine to
compile the kernel and the module in lock step.  Anyway, I don't care
as long as sizeof(spinlock_t) is the same in SMP and UP, everything
else being equal.  The difference in GCC version is exactly the
optimization which I want to remove.  Especially if it removes two
variables in one swoop (gcc version and SMP), but I suspect there is
more to the dependence on gcc version.

I think some kernel developers sometimes go overboard in their
optimization :-) Saving four bytes in each spinlock just isn't worth
the hassle, IMO.
