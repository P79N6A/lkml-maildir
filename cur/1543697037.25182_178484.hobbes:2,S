You want to do that event if there was nothing attached to the port
as a mouse might get plugged in while the box is suspended. I think
serio_rescan() is more appropriate (it will do a disconnect if needed
for you).
Overall there is a problem with disconnect/connect method as it will 
cause a new input device created for the same hardware if old input
device is held open by some process. If ever serio_reconnect patches
will make in the tree then serio_reconnect() can be used instead of
serio_rescan() as it will try to keep the same input device.
