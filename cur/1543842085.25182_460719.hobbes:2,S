Historically ->signal/->sighand (both ptrs and their contents) were globally
protected by tasklist_lock. 'current' can use these pointers lockless, they
can't be changed under him.
Nowadays ->signal/->sighand are _also_ protected by ->sighand->siglock.
Unless you are current, you can't lock ->siglock directly (without holding
tasklist_lock), you should use lock_task_sighand().
But I don't understand ->signal->tty locking. I know nothing about job
control, looking into the tty_io.c for the first time.
tty_io.c:
	->tty is set under task_lock()
	->tty is cleared under lock_kernel() + tasklist_lock
	except TIOCNOTTY, cleared under task_lock()
Note that include/linux/sched.h doesn't document that ->alloc_lock
protects ->tty, it is only used in tty_io.c for that purpose, why?
daemonize:
	->tty is cleared under tty_mutex
sys_setsid:
	->tty is cleared under tty_mutex + tasklist_lock
Btw, I think tiocsctty()/tty_open() is racy wrt to sys_setsid().
tiocsctty() can see the result of '->signal->leader = 1' before
sys_setsid() changed ->session/->pgrp and passed '->tty = NULL'.
I think tiocsctty() and tty_open() need tty_mutex, no?

I think the purpose of read_lock(&tasklist_lock) was to protect ->tty,
not ->signal, so I believe this comment is not correct.
Am I understand correctly? tasklist_lock is not enough, ->tty could be
cleared by ioctl(TIOCNOTTY). tty_mutex can't protect from changing ->tty
pointer, but it protects from releasing tty_struct, yes?
What about ->tty usage in do_task_stat() then ?

Ugh. I think this is ok, but I know nothing about audit.c. grep, grep ...
This 'tsk' should be == current. Probably we need a comment.
copy_process() calls audit_free() after cleanup_signal() (frees ->signal),
but in that case context->in_syscall can't be true, so audit_log_exit()
is not called, yes ?
