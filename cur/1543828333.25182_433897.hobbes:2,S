There is one possible issue with this approach. Lets assume that we desire
a cap of 10 for a set of two tasks. As discussed earlier, each task
would get a limit of 5% if they are equally busy.
Lets call the group as G1 and the tasks as T1 and T2.
If we have another group called G2 with tasks T3, T4 and T5 and a soft
cap of 90. Then each of T3, T4 and T5 would get a soft cap of
30% (assuming that they are equally busy). Now if T5 stops using its limit
for a while let say its cpu utilization is 10% - how do we divide the saved
20% between T1, T2, T3 and T4.
In a group scenario, the balance 20% should be shared between T3 and T4.
Also mathematically
A group is a superset of task
It is hard to implement things for a task and make it work for groups,
but if we had something for groups, we could easily adapt it to tasks
by making each group equal to a task

By how much is the task allowed to exceed if there is spare capacity?
Will the spare capacity allocation require resetting of caps to implement
the new caps?
