It depends if it takes the working set down (you dont care about the total
amount of data but the amount regularly being used) - thttpd uses a _lot_
less memory for the webserver itself so can help
As to c) - 2.4.x and with patches 2.2.x will do UDMA66/UDMA100 I/O on modern
disks and that takes the CPU usage down (so you do more work while the
disk is copying stuff) and might well be getting data on/off disk ten times
as fast
