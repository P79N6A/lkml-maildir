Yes. Yours is a separate problem, and is not due to invalidate_pages() at
all, but apparently due to truncate_complete_page().
Basically, all the same old arguments do apply - we cannot just remove the
page from the page cache if it is mapped.
Now, the truncate() case is different, because the code _tries_ to also
zap the actual mappings. The fact that it fails to do so is a bit
unnerving, actually. 
I'll take a better look at the truncate case (I consider the invalidate
case closed). Do you have a simple test-program around?
