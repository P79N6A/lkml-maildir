Agreed.  In fact, you may want to write a header that implements the
kprint_ functions in terms of printk for out-of-core driver writers to
incorporate into their code bases, so they can  upgrade their API while
maintaining backward compatibility.  (If it were me, I'd also give it
a very permissive license, like outright public domain, to encourage use.)

Well, in context:
	kp_info("Message.");
Even the "kp_" prefix is actually pretty unnecessary.  It's "info"
and a human-readable string that make it recognizable as a log message.
Another reason to keep it short is just that it's going to get typed a LOT.
Anyway, just MHO.
