No. Look in /etc/ppp/ip_up /etc/ppp/ip_down. Read the docs. These control
what gets set/reset when the ppp connection is set up or torn down.
You can configure to do anything you want, including completely
reconfiguring your network when a ppp connection is established.
This is not a kernel affair.
