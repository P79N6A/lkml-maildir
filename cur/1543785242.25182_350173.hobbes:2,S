I think that main() is a known name and therefore gets a special treatment 
- if you rename main() to foo() and then compare the disassembly you will 
see that the "andl $-16,%esp" has vanished.
OTOS the "andl" in main() exactly does show how gcc wants the stack to be 
aligned, i.e. _before_ the call-address push.
Another argument would be the 16-byte aligned stack-setup of glibc - please 
try runing this tiny program under gdb and look at "info reg":
     asm(".globl main\n main:\n int $3\n");
All of this would indicate that the kernel should get fixed.
