Yes, very true. But now that the patch is in 2.6 by default, I think the
situation changes.
Just imagine a person who doesn't even know what IPsec is, trying to
configure a 2.6 kernel. "IP: AH tranformation.. What's that? Let's check
the help page. Oh, it says I should just say Yes. Okay, let's do that."
Shouldn't the text "If unsure, say Y." be more like "If you want to use
IPsec, you need this."? Possibly with an addition like "If you don't
know what IPsec is, you don't need it."?
