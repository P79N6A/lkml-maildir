Subject: 0/18 2.4.19 architecture updates for s390 following
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Last friday, we had a new code drop on developerworks with 
s390 patches against 2.4.17. The patches following this mail 
contain that code, updated to 2.4.19. They were prepared by Martin 
Schwidefsky, but he's on holidays now, so I'm sending them instead.
The first eleven patches contains large updates for s390 architecture 
dependent files that are maintained here, so I'm not sending
them to lkml. The rest are smaller bits, some of which are more
controversial.
