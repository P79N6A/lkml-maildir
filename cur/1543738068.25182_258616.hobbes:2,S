Ben:
Pavel Machek suggested you were a good person to ask this question.
I see that the power tree agrees pretty much with the device tree, but
there is the possibility of having a different parent pointer.  However
the device_pm_set_parent() routine isn't called anywhere in the kernel.  
Does that mean it can be eliminated, making the two trees identical?
