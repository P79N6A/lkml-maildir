Yes, I've used quilt for working with mm patches in the past, but I'm
not too familiar with the mail features.  For example, how do you get
the recipient list and Signed-off-by in the patch file?  Do you just
edit it by hand?  Or is there some guide to quilt I should be reading?
I looked at the guide in /usr/share/doc/quilt/quilt.pdf, but it didn't
have anything about email.  /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.MAIL has the
details of all of the mail options, but doesn't give a nice example of
what to do with the patch file and how to call 'quilt mail'.
