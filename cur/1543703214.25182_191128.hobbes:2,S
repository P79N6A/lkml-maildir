I reference the one other user of CRC32C in my code, that would be the
sctp network driver, at this time.
Of course, there is library/crc32, which I did make an attempt to
implement companion code to it, but we really need the "work over
scatterlists" feature of the crypto routines.
I took the design goals the of the library/crc32 routines (flexible
XOR policy, flexible initial values) and tried to allow that in the
crypto chksum routines.  CRC32 could be moved into it, but the uses of
CRC32 are often quick accumulation over packet fragments, rather than
computing digests over scatterlists describing would can be many K of
data.
