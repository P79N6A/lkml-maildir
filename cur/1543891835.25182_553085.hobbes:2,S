hi @all,
is it possible to set the skb->priority on arp packets generated by the 
kernel?
I want to to set the 802.1p priority on arp and ip packets on an interface. On 
ip packets, this can be done by the iptables CLASSIFY target and the 
skb->priority mapping from the vlan implementation.
any ideas?
thx
Marc
