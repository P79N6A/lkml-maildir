I think someone suggested that you could have a user-space daemon which
has a SIGDANGER handler, and when it gets this signal it implements the
user's policy of killing programs before the kernel OOM handler kicks in.
It wouldn't exactly be the same thing, but it may be able to help in some
cases.  I usually have many programs that could be killed and restarted
when the memory crunch was gone (e.g. faxrunq=1.7MB, xntpd=1.2MB,
mpg123=3MB, etc).
It would be _much_ better, however, to have important programs handle
SIGDANGER themselves, since they can free large internal buffers (e.g.
X and Netscape).  If there is a danger that Netscape is causing the OOM
itself, it can free buffers itself first and/or simply exit if there
are no buffers to be freed.  
Cheers, Andreas
