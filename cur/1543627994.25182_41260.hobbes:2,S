No. It is not the lack of peer-to-peer connections that gives rise to the 
bottleneck, but the idea of several threads multiplexing sendfile() through a 
single socket. Given a bad program design, it can be done over TCP too.
The conclusion is that the programmer really ought to choose a different 
design. For multimedia streaming, for instance, it makes sense to use 1 UDP 
socket per thread rather than to multiplex the output through one socket.
