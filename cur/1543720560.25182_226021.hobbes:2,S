To clarify: the confusion is not that those two symbols
(PERFCTR_CPUS_FORBIDDEN_MASK_NEEDED and PERFCTR_INTERRUPT_SUPPORT)
are tested with #if in some places and #ifdef in others;
instead it is that the symbols are either 1 or undefined,
but always tested with #if. This, while valid C, may seem
slightly strange.
Thanks Valdis for pointing this out. I'll clean this up.
Andrew: please apply Valdis' cleanup patch.
(I can send a new one if you didn't save it.)
