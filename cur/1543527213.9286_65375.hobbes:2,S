When I was writing a modem testing tool, I had a situation where I needed 
to reduce the code run time as much as possible on x86 architecture.  So 
for that application I coded up the tests using logical OR and AND, and 
bitwise OR and AND, and profiled the difference.
The bitwise-operations version ran about 40 percent faster than its 
logical-operations equivalent.  Part of the savings was the parallel 
testing of multiple bits (this is looking at the modem control register of 
a UART), but part of the savings was just in the sheer amount of code that 
had to be fetched and executed.
No hand-tweaking of the code was necessary -- the output of the compiler 
was plenty good for my purposes.
