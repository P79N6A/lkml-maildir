That is already working in the kernel Bugzilla for years
(with Andrew currently doing most of the work).
You might be in the lucky and unusual position that you have the 
hardware for reproducing most bugs in the drivers you maintain,
but that's nothing that's generally true.
Bugs in e1000 have a good chance of being resolved, if you want a really
bad example think of e.g. a bug in some unmaintained ISA network driver
We already have 1350 open bugs in the kernel Bugzilla, and the real 
problem is not how to track them but to find someone who resolves them.
