Subject: PCMCIA modem (v.90 X2) not working with 2.4.0-test12 PCMCIA services

Hi,
I have built my test12 kernel with the following options:
CONFIG_PCMCIA=y
CONFIG_CARDBUS=y
CONFIG_I82365=y
CONFIG_PNP=y
CONFIG_ISAPNP=y
CONFIG_PCMCIA_SERIAL=y
CONFIG_PCMCIA_SERIAL_CS=m
CONFIG_PCMCIA_SERIAL_CB=m
I have the 3.1.22 version of David Hinds' PCMCIA installed.
It didn't build the drivers, since the package is configured to
use the kernel's drivers.
dmesg shows:

"cardctl ident" shows:
Socket 1:
    product info: "PCMCIA", "V.90 Communications Device ", "", ""
    manfid: 0x018a, 0x0001
My modem is not one of the default supported devices,
so I added a device entry in /etc/pcmcia/config:
    card "V90"
    manfid 0x018a, 0x0001
    bind "serial_cs"
The modem is model PN610-X2 (a 56K V.90 PCMCIA Fax-Modem)
made by Hawking Technology.  It's a 16-bit, PCMCIA 2.1-compliant,
Type II PC Card.
