Of course the correct solution is to have the kernel version in the file 
name...  and have linux-current or whatever as a symlink.  Besides truth 
be told the kernel version is far too little to identify a kernel anyway, 
there's also compilation options - they can change a lot - and all the 
patches which were/are applied to it.  I keep System.map-`uname -r`,
vmlinuz-`uname -r`, .config-`uname -r`, descr-`uname -r` in my /boot dirs 
- the first three come from the kernel and the last is a text file 
containing notes about what patches were applied (I keep an up to date 
descr file in each kernel source dir).
Cheers,
MaZe.
