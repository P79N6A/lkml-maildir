I would put it to loads, where it doesn't matter that all streams
will be serviced all the time and where it does matter more, that
we stay responsive and show the latest frames available.

I'm aware of these, but if we are so heavily busy, that the
applications looses IO frames already, then calling into an
application (which might be swapped out) to traverse its
AIO overhead the cancel makes no sense any more.
I want a deadline attached to them and have them automatically
cancelled after this deadline. (that's why I quoted the relevant
part of my e-mail again).
I can see many uses besides multi media applications. Also http
or ftp server could do this, if they are busier as expected or if
a connection dropped.
