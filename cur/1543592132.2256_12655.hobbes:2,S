Subject: nfs mount by label not working.

Using kernel 2.2.17-14 as supplied by RedHat, and using mount from
mount-2.9u-4, mounting by label using the -L option does not work.
    mount -L backup1 /a
    mount: no such partition found
The mount man page says that "/proc/partitions" must exist.
    ls -l /proc/partitions
    -r--r--r--   1 root     root            0 May 23 15:10 /proc/partitions
Does something need to be enabled to make this work? What else might I be doing
wrong?
