I remember getting hit with this several times in the last few -mm's as I
did bisecting and kept crossing over the patch that did that. Fortunately,
'make oldconfig' was nice enough to keep me honest and prompt me for the new
symbol names.
What the Kbuild system *could* use is, for the end of 'make oldconfig', a
report like this for 'y' or 'm' symbols that have evaporated:
The following enabled symbols found in the .config were not defined in any Kconfig file:
CONFIG_FROOBY
CONFIG_DEBUG_FROOBY
So people aren't totally mystified   Admittedly, I've only gotten bit by
silently dissapearing symbols 4-5 times since 2.5.55 or so, but the times
it happened it would have been nice to know....
(OK, I admit it - at least once of those 4-5 times it was because I ran
'make oldconfig' and I hadn't applied a local patch that added a Kconfig option.
Even in that case, a "Yo, dood, something went poof" msg would have saved me
a lot of bang-head-against-wall debugging. :)
