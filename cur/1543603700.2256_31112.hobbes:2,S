No, that won't work for me, because cpu_online_map is set by
smp_boot_cpus(), at least on PPC (in fact each CPU sets its bit in
cpu_online_map as it spins up).
There shouldn't be a race on x86 at all, because the secondary
processors don't call init_idle until after they see that the primary
cpu has call smp_commence.  (There is currently a race on PPC since we
call init_idle before waiting for smp_commence, but that would not be
your problem.)

No, I think it should be smp_boot_cpus, set wait_init_idle,
smp_commence, then the secondaries start clearing their bits.  Which
AFAICS is the way it is on x86.  What architecture is your wildfire?
Paul.
