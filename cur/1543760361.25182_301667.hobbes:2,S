The problem is that with this change:
+       if (offset == ra->prev_page && --req_size)
+               ++offset;
we can't just return newsize.
Because the caller of page_cache_readahead(offset, req_size) expects
that returned value is the number-of-pages successfully read from
this original offset.
Consider do_generic_mapping_read() reading two pages at offset 10,
with ra->prev_page == 10.
1st page, index == 10:
	ret_size = page_cache_readahead(10, 2);		// returns 1
	next_index += ret_size;				// next_index == 11
2nd page, index == 11:
	if (index == next_index)			// Yes
		page_cache_readahead(11, 1);		// BOGUS!
It can be solved without behavioural change of course, but it will be
more complex.

Yes, it's my fault. I should have added comment in changelog at least.
