 Specifically, it wasn't used much at the beginning (see e.g. when we came
to trying it -- it's already ~15 years since it was introduced) and then
the crapware era began and some manufacturers stopped taking care of less
commonly used standard functionality.

 I recall testing an i486 laptop around 1996 and not only it accepted
switching mode to #3, but it reported it as being active then as well. 
Yet it generated #2 codes regardless...
