Some of the main NFS client developers (Trond, the CITI-UM developers, 
myself) have reviewed previous versions of this code, and have 
recommended a number of changes.  I haven't heard anything recently from 
the NetApp engineers working on this.  We are waiting for them to 
publish again, but I think they are waiting for the last of the 
transport switch patches to trickle into mainline (which should be ready 
with the release of 2.6.21).  I know they have been working with a 
handful of test sites and have achieved good performance results.

Not yet, but the place that is likely to occur is nfs@lists.sourceforge.net.
