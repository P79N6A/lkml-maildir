I was at the summit but I guess I missed any real discussion on it, other
than the out of meeting sequence with Linus basically yelling at Eric
over some CML2 stuff.
I still hold the opinion the CML1 declarations are sufficient, and that
mconfig is more than enough to do what we need, possibly coupled with
some automatic rule validation stuff.
