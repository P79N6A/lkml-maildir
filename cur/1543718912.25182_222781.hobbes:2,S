Subject: [2.6.7-rc1] BUG: ibmasm doesn't compile

Actually the ibmasm driver (driver->misc->ibmasm) hasn't compiled in 
some versions. However, it will compile as a module, so at the expecse 
of having all the stuff to do modules you can use it. Given the size of 
the machines which use that hardware, that's hardly an issue ;-) But not 
compiling built-in indicates a problem.
Does anyone know if there will be a driver for the current hardware? The 
one in 2.6.recent can see an RSA-I card, but doesn't seem to speak to 
the RSA-II card, which is required for security.
