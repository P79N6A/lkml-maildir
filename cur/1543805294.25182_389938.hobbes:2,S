The RLIMIT_MEMLOCK feature itself may be a security bug implemented the way it 
currentlyy is.
For me it would make sense to be able to lock everything in core and then
be able to tell the system that at most 1MB of additional memory may be locked.
In this case, there should be no general failure but the possibility to
verify that the value is sufficient for usual cases.
