Yes....  There is a patch in -mm called
    md-change-lifetime-rules-for-md-devices.patch
which tries to remove md devices when they are no longer needed.
However it is racy, and it seems to be impossible to close the race
without making changes in core code as well.
For now, just revert that patch.
Andrew: you can drop that patch and the two related one.  This is 
  going to need a lot more thought, and I'm not sure it is worth it
  at the moment.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
