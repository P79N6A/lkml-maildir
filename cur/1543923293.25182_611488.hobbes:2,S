Subject: Bootup support for watchdog with short timeout (touch_nmi_watchdog()?)

I'm trying to implement support for a board specific watchdog on a PPC440EPx 
board with a very short timeout. In this case, the watchdog has to 
be "kicked" at least every 100ms, even while booting and the real watchdog 
driver not running yet. While looking for trigger places in the kernel 
source, I noticed the already existing "touch_nmi_watchdog()" function, which 
seems to be doing what I need. Even if the name not exactly matches my 
hardware setup.
My question now is, is it recommended to use this 
touch_nmi_watchdog() "infrastructure" for my PPC custom specific watchdog 
during bootup? And if yes, should it perhaps be renamed to a more generic 
name, like "touch_watchdog"?
Please advise. Thanks.
Best regards,
Stefan
