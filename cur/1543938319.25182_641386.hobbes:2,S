I suppose. I still find this approach less than ideal, especially
putting something potentially large on the stack. The dangers are
perhaps worse than a malloc, really. 
I also don't like your interface much. Consider this alternative:
struct mprintk *mp = mprintk_begin(KERN_INFO "ata%u.%2u: ", 1, 0);
mprintk(mp, "ATA %d", 7);
mprintk(mp, ", %u sectors\n", 1024);
mprintk(mp, "everything seems dandy\n");
mprintk_end(mp);
That keeps all the "normal" printks short and makes the flush more
explict.
Now we make mprintk_begin attempt to do a kmalloc of a moderate size
(512 bytes?) and failing that, return null. Then mprintk can fall
through to printk in the NULL case.
