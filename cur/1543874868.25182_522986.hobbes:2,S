Please elaborate. Short of ROM I don't see how you'd achieve it.
Looks more like a misunderstanding than misleading going on here.

I wasn't talking about a single security scheme, I was talking about the
possible schemes. Would you trust someone to protect your account if he says
he's able to write protect your account, but not read protect it? And keep
in mind I'm talking about technical abilities, not cases where one access
is chosen to be allowed.
Purposely allowing the one and disallowing the other is a different case.
But there's a difference between opening your door and having a door with
a bad lock.

Maybe, maybe not. The signature won't stop people from modifying the loaded
kernel, something else has to. And if that 'something' can stop modifications,
it most likely can also read protect a part of kernel RAM too, with little
tweaking. If it can't, I wouldn't trust it to write protect the kernel either.

My point is valid, but you seem to confuse it with scenarios where you want to
allow the one and disallow the other, and using that as an argument that my
point isn't valid.
I already said in another email that symmetric key encryption is only as secure
as RSA if each device has its own key, in the case of signed binaries. I'm also
not trying to argue that all asymmetric crypto uses can be replaced with
symmetric ones, in case you wonder.
What I do try to make clear is that for certain cases there are alternatives
which are as secure as RSA, and that a lot apparent weaknesses of that approach
are also present with RSA, and that no matter what you use, you need to have
the same basic security in place for both.
