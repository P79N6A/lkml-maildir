Subject: [BK PATCH] PCI fixes and PCI Express drivers for 2.6.11-rc1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Here are some small PCI patches for 2.6.11-rc1, and the addition of a
new PCI Express subsystem (it's self contained, if you don't have PCI
Express, or select it, the code never gets built.)  All of these patches
have been in the past few -mm releases.
Please pull from:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/pci-2.6
thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
