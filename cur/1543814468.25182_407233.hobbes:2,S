decl_subsys() is in the sysfs.h header file, not the device.h file.
Just stay away from anything in there if you hate the driver core so
much :)

It "should" work in theory, but in real-life, the odds of getting all of
that lifetime logic correct...  :)
You can do it, but in general, it's easier to think about kobjects as
being dynamic devices, as that is what they are.  So making them dynamic
for real is a better thing to do to reinforce that principle.
Again, what are you doing that you can't use the driver core for?
