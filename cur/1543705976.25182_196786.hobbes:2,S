We have that - it's what the generic arch is. It's also good for distros, 
as it'll enable them to build one binary kernel and run it on flat SMP 
boxes and the Summit/x440 boxes.
If we really want to do good testing, we should make a fake NUMA config
that can run a 4x SMP box as fake NUMA, with half the memory in each
"node" and half the processors ... but I never got around to coding that ;-)
