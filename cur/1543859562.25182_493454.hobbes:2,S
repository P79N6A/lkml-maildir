I'm not sure, but thats not entirely relevant either.  The time it takes 
for the AP to respond is not related to the delay between userspace 
sending the siwscan and giwscan ioctls (unless you're thinking of 
userspace being too quick, but GIWSCAN already returns -EINPROGRESS when 
appropriate so this is detectable)

I think it's reasonable to keep the interface down, but then when the 
user does want to connect, bring the interface up, scan, present scan 
results. Scanning is quick, there would be minimal wait needed here.
Alternatively, if you do want to prepare scan results in the background 
every 2 minutes, use a sequence something like:
- bring interface up
- siwscan
- giwscan [...]
- bring interface down
- repeat after 2 mins
If this kind of thing was implemented at the driver level, in most cases 
it would be identical to doing the above anyway.
