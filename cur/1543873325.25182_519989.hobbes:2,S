Assuming we had a means of creating a zone that was assigned to a container,
a second zone for shared data between a set of containers.  For shared data,
the time the pages are being allocated is at page fault time. At that point,
the faulting VMA is known and you also know if it's MAP_SHARED or not.
The caller allocating the page would select (or create) a zonelist that
is appropriate for the container. For shared mappings, it would be one
zone - the shared zone for the set. For private mappings, it would be
one zone - the shared zone for the set.
For overcommit, the allowable zones for overcommit could be included.
Allowing overcommit opens the possibility for containers to interfere with
each other but I'm guessing that if overcommit is enabled, the administrator
is willing to live with that interference.
This has the awkward possibility of having two "shared" zones for two container
sets and one file that needs sharing. Similarly, there is a possibility for
having a container that has no shared zone and faulted in shared data. In
that case, the page ends up in the first faulting container set and it's
too bad it got "charged" for the page use on behalf of other containers. I'm
not sure there is a sane way of accounting this situation fairly.
I think that it's important to note that once data is shared between containers
at all that they have the potential to interfere with each other (by reclaiming
within the shared zone for example).

We'd choose the appropriate zonelist before faulting. Once allocated,
the page stays there.

I have no strong feelings here. To me, it's "who do I assign this fake
zone to?" I guess you would have at least one zone per container mount
for private data.

Stuff like shrinking dentry caches is already pretty course-grained.
Last I looked, we couldn't even shrink within a specific node, let alone
a zone or a specific dentry. This is a separate problem.

Merging "orphaned" zones back into the "main" zone would seem a sensible
choice.

For the lookup to software zone to be efficient, it would be easiest to have
them as MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES contiguous. This would avoid having to break the
existing assumptions in the buddy allocator about MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES
always being in the same zone.

MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES would be the minimum zone size.

Moving the tasks around would not be easy. It would require a new zone
to be created based on the new NUMA node and all the data migrated. hmm
