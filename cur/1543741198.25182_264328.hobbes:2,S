The problem with doing that is that these error codes have specific meanings
that we're then violating the standards by overloading. Take open() for
example: it's possible that this will return ENOENT because there's no file
there to be opened; I think it's a bad idea for it to return ENOENT when there
is a file there, but we don't have a key, hence ENOKEY.
