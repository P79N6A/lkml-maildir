The "hdparm doesn't get as high scores as in 2.4" is a old discussed to 
death "problem" on LKML. So far nobody has been able to show it affects 
anything  but that pretty useless quasi-benchmark.

Really sluggish or just "benchmark-sluggish"? If the former, try 
selecting a different IO elevator/sheduler. If the latter it doesn't 
matter much, at least not with the very simple hdparm test :-)

Nothing wrong with 73% iowait, I'd even consider it very low while 
putting load on a harddrive. Its just time spent waiting for data to be 
returned from disk, and thus I usually expect no lower than ~98-99% 
while stressing any disk. Harddisks are _slow as snails_ compared to cpu 
cycles ;-)
Beware 2.4 didn't export that statistic at all to userspace, so 0% 
iowait gets reported from most 2.6-ready reporting tools on 2.4.
