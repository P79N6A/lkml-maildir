Oh, _I_ always understood. You were the one that was arguing for stable
numbers as somehow important. I'm just telling you that they aren't
stable, and that a user application that depends on their stability or
their uniqieness is BROKEN.

And I still disagree. You seem to think that this is an "absolute 
goodness", and call it a quality issue.
While I personally strongly believe that it is a bug in user space to
care, and that it is not a quality issue at all, but rather a "allow buggy
and/or nonconverted user space to work".
In other words, it's not about "quality", as much as about compatibility 
with applications that are old and/or braindead. Big difference.
