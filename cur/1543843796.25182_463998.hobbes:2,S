Unlikely.. As Jan pointed out in the last thread anything that links 
against glibc does a dozen opens on invocation:
[jbrindle@twoface ~]$ strace -eopen gzip -9 -   
open("/usr/lib64/fglrx/tls/x86_64/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No 
such file or directory)
open("/usr/lib64/fglrx/tls/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such 
file or directory)
open("/usr/lib64/fglrx/x86_64/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such 
file or directory)
open("/usr/lib64/fglrx/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file 
or directory)
open("/usr/lib/fglrx/tls/x86_64/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No 
such file or directory)
open("/usr/lib/fglrx/tls/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file 
or directory)
open("/usr/lib/fglrx/x86_64/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such 
file or directory)
open("/usr/lib/fglrx/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or 
directory)
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY)      = 3
open("/lib64/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY)      = 3

this wouldn't be able to run if it couldn't open libc.so so you'd be 
limited to static binaries (with statically linked libs that don't do 
any open() calls) that don't do any kind of name resolution (ip, uid), 
have no config files, etc. very limited.. and my other point was that 
even if you did have said binary (the limitations make this very 
unlikely though) the binary could never be changed to open a file since 
it would then get all open access since capabilities are not fine grained.
The benefits of this are so minuscule and the cost is so high if you are 
ever to use it that it simply won't happen..
