Which doesn't invalidate the missing address problem, and the fact that
you are _already_ in the from line.

My previous commit was directly from _your_ patch, given that your
patches have a history of whitespace damage, this doesn't seem like much
of a stretch. It's true I neglected to run it through checkpatch, I'll be
more careful with that in the future when applying patches from certain
parties.
The point of submitting a series of patches is so that it's obvious
_what_ you are changing. Lumping it in with the whitespace changes just
makes it impossible to read, as GregKH also hinted at when trying to
figure out specifically what you were fixing. Since your patch splits up
logically in to different components, it makes sense to split the patch
up in to a series that makes it obvious. I'm not sure why this needs to
be spelled out for you.
