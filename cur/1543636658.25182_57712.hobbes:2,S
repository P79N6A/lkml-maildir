Actually, checking for _all_ even remotely possible and checkable error
conditions (if the check doesn't incur an intolerable overhead) is a very very
important requirement for writing high quality code; even if it isn't "fault
tolerant" (because it may not know how to recover, as with the ill-defined
semantics of close() returning error), it will at least be "fail-fast"; giving
an error message close to the cause and terminate in a co-ordinated manner
before corrupting data.
It troubles me deeply that some people hacking on the Linux kernel do not
consider this a good thing.
And with that, I conclude my point and step out of the discussion for good.
Sincerely,
