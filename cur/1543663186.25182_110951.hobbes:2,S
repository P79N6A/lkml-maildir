0xFF is what happens with a real hot unplug so we must handle it
irrespective of convenience. Your probe loop might want to check
some kind of 'dead' variable when this is all done I guess. That
way we can have
	unplugged_event()
	{
		change iops
		drive->dead = 1;
	}
and the probe code can spot ->dead in the poll loop
