Yes.  From my IDE oops dumper experience, you can get the required
kernel symbols down to 70k w/o kdb (it's about 380k as stands).  I
haven't made this optimization yet though.

Hmm, depends on state of module loader code.   If it goes in, you'll
be getting a new one anyway which doesn't have this problem (I use $CC
to create kallsyms.o which gets linked in).  Otherwise, yes.
Cheers,
