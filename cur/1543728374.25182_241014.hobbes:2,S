If you just want to try out some wacky ideas, I suggest you take a look 
at the network block device.
It is a block device that sends all read/write requests through a socket 
  so that this requests can be fulfilled by a user space deamon.
This is not very good in terms of performance, but it is much easier to 
develop this kind of thing in userspace, without all the stack / memory 
/ atomicity / concurrency problems :)
