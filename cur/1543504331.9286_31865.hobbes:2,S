A) You could have a user tread that does a 'select' against the file.
When the interrupt comes the driver releases the thread.
while (select(...))
{
  /* handle interrupt */
}
The problem is how to clear the interrupt...
B) Another possibility is to use bottom halves, processed right after
the
thread has left. (but you still has to clear it inside the driver)
[I do not really like this approach...]
C) A third way is to make a driver frame work that is compiled and
loaded with using load able modules. You can unload, recompile, load
without rebooting (I think, 95%)
This should be possible, but you have to ask someone else... (I have
never done it...)
One thing more - writing device drivers in Linux is said to be easier
than in many other OSes. And you have a better framework around you
then in dos.
