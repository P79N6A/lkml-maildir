    Christoph> Any reason this doesn't use an interface similar to the

The normal vlan code uses an ioctl().  I thought a simple sysfs
interface would be more palatable than a new socket ioctl.
    Christoph> And what is a P_Key?
It is a 16-bit identifier carried by IB packets that says which
partition the packet is in.  End ports have P_Key tables that list
which partitions they are members of (a port can be a member of one or
more partitions, and can only receive packets from that partition).
