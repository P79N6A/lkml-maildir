Not yet decided.  There is the alternative to extend the accept()
interface to have both interfaces:
  int accept(int, struct sockaddr *, socklen_t *);
and
  int accept(int, struct sockaddr *, socklen_t *, int);
We can do this with type safety even in C nowadays.

If you read the mails of my first submission you'll find that I
explained this.  I talked to Andrew and he favored new syscalls.  But
then I talked to Linus and he favored this approach.  Probably
especially because it can be used for syslets as well.  And it is less
code and data than introducing new syscalls.
