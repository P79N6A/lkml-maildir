That won't fix the problem, but merely paper it over.  The problem is
in the balancing code that lets swap be exausted while at the same time
allowing cache to become obscenely obese in the first place.  I can't
trigger that behavior here, but it obviously exists for some workloads.
General thread comment:
To those who are griping, and obviously rightfully so, Rik has twice
stated on this list that he could use some help with VM auto-balancing.
The responses (visible on this list at least) was rather underwhelming.
I noted no public exchange of ideas.. nada in fact.
Get off your lazy butts and do something about it.  Don't work on the
oom-killer though.. that's only a symptom.  Work on the problem instead.
