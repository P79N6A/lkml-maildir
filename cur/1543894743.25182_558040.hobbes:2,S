Um, Casey, he is talking about how to emulate AppArmor behavior on a
label-based system like SELinux, not meeting B1 or LSPP or anything like
that (which AppArmor can't do regardless).  As far as general issue
goes, if your policy is configured such that the new file gets the most
restrictive label possible at creation time and then the daemon relabels
it to a less restrictive label if appropriate, then there is no actual
window of exposure.
Also, there is such a daemon, restorecond, in SELinux (policycoreutils)
although we avoid relying on it for anything security-critical
naturally.  And one could introduce the named type transition concept
that has been discussed in this thread without much difficulty to
selinux.
