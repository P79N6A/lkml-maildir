You can probably just do
cd /usr/src
ln -s linux-2.4.WHATEVERSUSE7.1HAS linux-2.4
to "fix" the latter problem, or maybe you need to tweak the Makefile.
As to the former problem, I cannot tell. Should your problem not be
solved until Jan 27th, feel free to ask me in private mail.
Oh, and while I'm at it: please do use a regular user account to read
and send mail, root should not expose himself to the dangers of possible
bugs in his mailer -- use yast or useradd to add a regular user for
yourself, and use /etc/aliases or /etc/mail/aliases to forward root mail
to that user.
