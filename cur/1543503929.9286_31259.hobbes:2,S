You have been warned about this FOOLISH action!!!!!!
NOW, the nicer reply.
Get a patch from one of the mirror sites for "LinuxIDE".
The old home was at ::
http://www.dyer.vanderbilt.edu/server/udma/
This URL will report an error 401 but also present links to the mirrors.
Should you blow of this help, do not ask/bitch/complain to the list or me.
