Subject: [git pull] ieee1394 tree for 2.6.18
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus,
the IEEE 1394 subsystem updates for Linux 2.6.18 are now staged in Ben's 
revived linux1394 git tree. I guess the URL to pull from is
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bcollins/linux1394-2.6.git
The updates in there are basically identical to the ieee1394 subsystem 
patches in 2.6.17-rc6-mm2. The essence:
  - a few fixes which did not seem important enough for 2.6.17
  - a performance tweak in the DMA routines
  - enhanced hardware compatibility (with 1394b PHYs when running at
    S100...S400, and with devices with link speed < phy speed)
  - minor coding updates, e.g. partial sem2mutex and kthread conversion
Thanks,
