drivers/char/toshiba.c and
net/atm/clip.c don't build if PROC_FS=n.
Patches for them are available at:
http://developer.osdl.org/rddunlap/patches/toshiba_inline_260t7.patch
http://developer.osdl.org/rddunlap/patches/atmprocfs_260t7.patch
There are several other drivers/protocols that don't build
with PROC_FS=n, like arlan, siimage, ipx, llc, and bluetooth.
