I don't really like exposing the vcpu_load()/vcpu_put() interfaces.
On the other hand, sleeping in a hypercall means the guest vcpu is not 
doing any processing.  Maybe we should declare hypercall handlers atomic 
and let them use a workqueue if they can't be atomic.
On the third hand, sleeping in a hypercall should be a rare event, so 
forcing hypercall handlers to handle the sleeping case introduces a lot 
of complexity for marginal gain.

One user would be the opengl guest to host tunneling driver/device 
that's being developed for qemu.

Xen does exactly that.  It's actually outside the scope of hypercalls, 
and more related to the protocol between guest and host.  Not that it 
can't be made generic (and the Xen rings are).
Maybe we should just copy the code.

True.  I expect it's more necessary with networking.
Somthing else that came up in a conversation with Dor: the need for a 
clean way to raise a guest interrupt.  The guest may be sleeping in 
userspace, scheduled out, or running on another cpu (and requiring an 
ipi to get it out of guest mode).
Right now I'm thinking about using the signal machinery since it appears 
to do exactly the right thing.
