Hi!
What is keeping hte APM REJECT ioctl from getting into the kernel ?
The patch was first released eons ago.
With it, you can assign any function to the power button ( and to the
sleep button if anyone has one ), without it, the power button crashes
the system ( actually it first informs linux that a suspend is pending,
and then it cuts the power. useless At least that's my experience with
it).
apmd also supports this feature since long.
Regards,
david
