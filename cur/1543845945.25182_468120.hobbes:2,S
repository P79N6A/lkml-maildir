It is better to place these forward declarations right at the top of the
include file.  That prevents people from later accidentally adding another
forward declaration of the same structure at an earlier point in the file,
and keeps all the same types of thing in the same place.

Looks crappy in 80-cols.  But I don't know if breaking this line will break
