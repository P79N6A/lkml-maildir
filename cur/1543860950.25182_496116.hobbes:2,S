See my updated Take 3 patch. I've implemented a uniqueness fix by
adding additional RSP flags do make R6 and R7 unique. I don't know
if this is what you wanted, but it works without being too ugly.
However, also note my caveat that it's not clear if tifm or imxmmc
can ever be made to work with SD 2.0 cards. *sigh*
