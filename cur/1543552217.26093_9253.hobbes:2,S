This afternoon I saw an anomaly.  Merrily typing away (as best one can
when downgrading from cable to dialup for a bit) I ran into some lag.
Oddly enough what has happened is that the PPP drivers reports a VJ
error and stops inbound packet flow.
"PPP: VJ decompression error" is the message.  After about 8 of these
messages all at once tcpdump shows traffic only going out and none
inbound, yet the modem indicates a return packet for each outbound ping
packet.
I had to break the connection and dial up again.  Any ideas?
