Not exactly. Well, not really a filesystem. But there's already security 
use of this feature you want to remove. Think LSM. Look at e.g. LIDS. Im 
using this additional protection already under 2.4.x to prevent uid 0 
processes to access /dev/mem and /dev/kmem where not explicitely 
granted. Please, _don't_ remove the capability check because you don't 
see any use for it as there _is_ already use for it.
