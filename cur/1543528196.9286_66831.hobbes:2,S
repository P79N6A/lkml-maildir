It is still not clear to me.  Perhaps I am making a wrong assumption about
when schedule returns.  In the scenario I described it seemed possible
for schedule to return before free_inodes was finished.
Process B is SCHED_FIFO waiting via sigpause().
Process A is SCHED_FIFO running and does signal() to Process B.
Process A waits in sigpause().
Process A run time in this case is very short, probably shorter that
free_inode loop.

if a SCHED_OTHER process sends a signal to a waiting SCHED_FIFO process
shouldn't the SCHED_FIFO wakeup and run?  What mechanism accomplishes
this?
