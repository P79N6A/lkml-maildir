Does it also specify how to find out what granularity is used by the
filesystem?  I had a need for this just recently and couldn't see any
way to extract it.
[If the mtime of a file matches the current time, then you cannot
cache the contents of the file.  You have to wait until the mtime is
in the past.  Without knowing the granularity, you cannot tell if the
mtime still matches current time or not]
Thanks,
