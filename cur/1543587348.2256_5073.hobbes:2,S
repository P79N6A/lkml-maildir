I agree.  I use menuconfig and it's pretty good, but sometimes I miss
the ability to go through all the available options and decide, one by
one, whether I want to enable the option.
Of course if I do not enable some PCI NIC driver, I do not need to see
special options for that driver.  That's good.  On the other hand, if I
am looking to enable RED, I won't realise that I need to enable
traffic shaping first to discover the RED option.
