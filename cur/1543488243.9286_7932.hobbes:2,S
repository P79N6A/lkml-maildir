Sure. Some vibra16 cards have two eight bit channels not one eight, one sixteen
as most of these cards and the SB16 proper do. Creative labs refuse to tell me
how to handle these cards. These cards are not fully supported.
Creative are beginning to make "we know about Linux now" noises but still
"binary only for our drivers" stories. Shrug, lots of people make sound
cards, USB audio is a standardised spec.
