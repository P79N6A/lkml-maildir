Let me add my 2c, please.
I think that the most of users will use ext3 or reiserfs anyway, unless they 
actually _prefer_ ext2 for some reasons (let's face it: the most of users 
just follow the distribution defaults and the most of distributors set either 
ext3 or reiserfs as a default).  This, however, confines the use of ext2 to a 
(relatively) small group of users having special needs and means that the 
future ext2 code will get less testing in any case, just like old device 
drivers do (eg. old CD-ROM drivers ;-)).
I'm not for collapsing the ext2 and ext3 code bases, but IMHO your argument 
does not apply.
I think that the good reason for keeping both ext* code bases in the kernel 
tree is that _there_ _are_ _some_ people who will need ext2 for some 
purposes, so why should we pull the carpet from under them?
Yours,
