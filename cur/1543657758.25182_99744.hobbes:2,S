What do you mean by "top"?
The /boot partition should be towards the front of the disk, i.e. with
a low starting cylinder number.
For example, my /boot is /dev/hda2:
# fdisk -l /dev/hda
Disk /dev/hda: 30.0 GB, 30005821440 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 3648 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
   Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
...
/dev/hda2             1         3     24066   83  Linux
