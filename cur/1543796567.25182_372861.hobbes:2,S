The following patchset (against 2.6.15-rc5ish) uses the new atomic ops to
do away with the offset page refcounting, and simplify the race that it
was designed to cover.
This allows some nice optimisations, and we end up saving 2 atomic ops
including a spin_lock_irqsave in the !PageLRU case, and 2 or 3 atomic ops
in the PageLRU case in the page-release path.
It also happens to be a requirement for my lockless pagecache work, but
they stand on their own as good patches.
