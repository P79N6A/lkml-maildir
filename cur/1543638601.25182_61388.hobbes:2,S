I completely disagree with you. I try hard to make my programs
compile without a warning with -Wall, even if it sometimes makes
the code a bit more difficult to read (mainly because of
parenthesis and casts). This way, I have fairly reduced portability
issues with 32/64 bits, LE/BE machines.
Just a hint :-)
It is always bad to ignore the compiler's complaints, because it tells
you that it may do things wrong when it's not sure about what you want.
Spending hours fixing a few warnings in the kernel has already led me
to fix some bugs that only a compiler or an attentive human would have
detected, specially when indentation fools you. Eg, this common mistake :
	if (something1)
		if (something 2)
			do_2();
	else
		do_not_1();
Cheers,
Willy
