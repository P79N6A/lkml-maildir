So? There's a bug, and we'll fix it. 
The _worst_ thing that can happen is that you have four extra (totally 
bogus) partitions, and you end up using the whole device.
That's my point about partitioning - not that it's necessarily perfect, 
but even when it _isn't_ perfect, it's no worse than not partitioning at 
all.
I know you don't want the kernel to partition at all. But I don't see your 
point.

Why don't they just read the whole device, if that is what they want to
do?
So we have two cases:
 a) we have a bug in the partitioning code, and don't parse the partition 
    table right:
	- let's fix the bug
 b) people don't want to read the partition info at all, as it's bogus
	- use the whole-device node.
In neither case is your "the kernel shouldn't guess" argument the answer, 
as far as I can see. And in both cases you _can_ fix it up in user mode if 
you know how, so clearly the kernel was no worse off guessing.
