For the umpteenth time, no it isn't. There are serious bugs in the shipped
version of gcc in RedHat 7.0, but they are fixed by applying the update.
The reason for supplying kgcc is to allow building a 2.2 kernel, because of
bugs in the kernel, NOT the compiler.

No. Provided you grab the update, you can build the 2.4 kernel perfectly
happily using the RedHat gcc snapshot. I'm running it successfully on a number
of machines. The issue with 2.4 on certain Netfinities is a bad interaction
between the NMI watchdog code and the systems management card. Changing
compilers makes no difference.
