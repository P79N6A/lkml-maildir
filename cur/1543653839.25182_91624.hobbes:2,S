To be more specific:
Read the MAC address in the probe phase.
Write MAC address to NIC on _each_ dev->open().
If you care about changing the MAC address while interface is up, 
implement dev->set_mac_address().
So, dev->set_mac_address() is pretty useless, when you can just tell 
users "down the interface before setting MAC address" which is a sane 
thing to do anyway, and much less complicated.
