The high level reason is that giving it more than its fair share of
CPU allows a desktop to remain interactive under load. And it isn't
just about doing work on behalf of other processes. Mouse interrupts
are a big part of it, for example.

You could do that, and I tried a variant of it at one point. The
problem was that it leads to unexpected bad things too.
UNIX programs more or less expect fair SCHED_OTHER scheduling, and
given the principle of least surprise...

I don't know how that supports your argument for unfairness, but
processes are special only because that's how we've always done
scheduling.  I'm not precluding other groupings for fairness, though.

Feel free. And I'd also argue that once you schedule for those metrics
then fairness is also important there too.

What do you mean optimal? If your criteria is fairness, then of course
it is optimal. If your criteria is throughput, then it probably isn't.
Considering it is simple and what we've always done, measuring fairness
by CPU time per process is obvious for a general purpose scheduler.
If you accept that, then I argue that fairness is an optimal property
given that the alternative is unfairness.

It's the bad behaviour that you didn't recognize that is the problem.
If you start with explicit fairness, then unfairness will never be
one of those problems.

This is not an optimization problem, it is a heuristic. There is no
right and wrong answer.

Probably not if you use common sense, and in the context of a replacement
for the 2.6 scheduler.
