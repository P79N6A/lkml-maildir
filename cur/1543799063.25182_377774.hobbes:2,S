2.6.15-rc6 doesn't boot on my computer with an Oops that has 
drivers/media/video/saa7134/saa7134-alsa.c prominently in it's trace.
A picture of the Oops is at [1] (I won't get a price for the best 
picture for it, but it's readable...).
Kernels up to 2.6.14.4 boot fine, 2.6.15-rc1 is the one that introduced 
the problem.
I must give saa7134.card=6 at the lilo prompt for getting my card 
working.
The saa7134 part of the dmesg in 2.6.14.4:
<--  snip  -->

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
