I guess we can reserve some extra space, and if we need even more space 
a new exit reason can specify a pointer to receive the exit data.
Of course, userspace should not get an unexpected exit reason.  I'm not 
worried about the short term, since it's likely there will only be a 
single user (modified qemu), long term we'll have userspace enable new 
features explicitly.
