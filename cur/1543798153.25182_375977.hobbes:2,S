Maybe I'm missing something but wouldn't you need an own critical
pool (or at least reservation) for each socket to be safe against deadlocks?
Otherwise if a critical sockets needs e.g. 2 pages to finish something
and 2 critical sockets are active they can each steal the last pages
from each other and deadlock.
