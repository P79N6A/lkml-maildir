I would point out that if you are looking for optimal throughput and 
reduced cpu overhead, and avoid blowing out the kernel fs cache, you 
need to couple aio with O_DIRECT.  By itself O_DIRECT will lower 
throughput because there will be brief pauses between each IO while the 
application prepares the next buffer.  You can overcome this by posting 
a few pending buffers concurrently with aio, allowing the kernel to 
always have a buffer ready for the next io as soon as the previous one 
completes.
