Thanks for your reply, I'll download the IA32 manual and try the next
option to flush the TLB. [IIRC, clearing the PGE flag in cr4, local tlb
flush, resetting the PGE flag, local tlb flush].

The Pentium has no _PAGE_GLOBAL flag, the PPro is the first processor

I didn't know that there is a IA32 manual, where can I find it (e.g the
number of the PDF file, or the exact title would help)
I found the Pentium III handbook on the Intel Developer CD, and they
have removed the sentence that WBINVD clears the TLB cache. It seems
this is a typo in the Pentium Pro handbook.
