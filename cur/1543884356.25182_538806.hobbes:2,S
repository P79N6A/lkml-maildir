It would definitely be interesting to try! I dont think it should 
negatively impact load balancing on SMP. The current fork-time behavior 
of CFS is really just a first-approximation thing, and what you propose 
seems to make more sense to me too because it preserves the fluidity of 
fairness. (I'd probably apply your patch even if there was no directly 
measurable impact on workloads, because the more natural approaches tend 
to be more maintainable in the long run.)
So by all means, please feel free to do a patch for this.

it made alot of sense and was very useful :-)
