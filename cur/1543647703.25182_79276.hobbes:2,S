Depends on which arch... on ppc32 (ahem... no bad joke pls ;),
function calls from modules to kernel or between modules has to
go through some "branch islands" as they don't fit within the
scope of a "short" branch PPC insn. So you also get a small
perf. loss there, but I bet it's barely measurable.
