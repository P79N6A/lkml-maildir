Only when eeh is enabled for a device, never happens on your g5 :)

Well, g5 will never play token games on you. I need to investigate a bit
about what's up with pSeries, in the meantim, Roland patch looks fine.
There still is that issue with __raw_* doing both barrier-less and
endianswap-less accesses though. I think there is a fundamental problem
here with drivers like matroxfb using them to get endian-less access and
losing barriers at the same time.
I'd rather have matroxfb use writel with an explicit swap, or better, the
driver could maybe disable big endian register access and switch the card
to little endian, provided it can do that while keeping the frame buffer
itself set to BE (which is necessary most of the time).
Petr ?
