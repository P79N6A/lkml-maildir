yeah...I hear that. I tried some grepping, but didn't come up with much
since #define MAX_SCSI_LUNS 0xFFFFFFFF; replaced 8, and then it's seems
nothing like the mainline code, so it's much different. 
If Andrea is listening, can you tell us if that's correct or not? Also,
it seems that passing max_scsi_luns=128 or even 10 or something at boot
time does not get parsed by scsi_mod, if CONFIG_SCSI=y. 
Can someone shed some light on that?
