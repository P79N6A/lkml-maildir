I don't understand this, regular skbs don't have anything to do with
rx_reserve_used as far as I can see. I'm only talking about keeping
that field up to date and correct. rx_reserve_used is only increased
by a skb when memalloc is set to true on that skb, so only if that field
is set rx_reserve_used needs to be reduced when the skb is freed.
Why is it needed for the protocol specific code to call dev_unreserve_skb?
Only problem is if the device can change. rx_reserve_used should probably
be updated when that happens, as a skb can't use reserved memory on a device
it was moved away from. (right?)

Perhaps, but the main reason to check memalloc instead of using
dev_reserve_used is because the latter doesn't tell which skb did the
reservation.

Yes, true. But doesn't matter for the rx_reserve_used accounting, as long as
memalloc set means that it did increase rx_reserve_used.

Up rx_reserve_used or the total ammount of reserved memory? Probably 'no' for
both though, as it's either device specific or skb dependent.
I'm slowly getting a clearer image of the big picture, I'll take another look
when you post the updated code.
