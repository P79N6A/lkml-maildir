This is the most idiotic argument I have ever heard, and completely
ignores reality. The kernel module is named already named "kafs", not "afs"
and *NOBODY* is using it because it does not have authentication or
read-write support.
If you want to talk about breaking userspace and existing scripts, the
AFS filesystem (of which the OpenAFS code is derived from) has existed
and been in production far longer than Linux.
( see 
http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=35037.35059
 )
At Iowa State University alone there are around 20K people that depend
on OpenAFS running on Linux for webmail service.
The only scripts I could think of that would be impacted by changing the
kernel afs mount name to 'kafs' would be the ones I am writing, and anything
David Howells has. That amounts to *maybe* 10 users.
If you really care about breaking long-standing userspace ABI's, will
you accept a patch allowing kAFS, OpenAFS, and Arla to register to
recieve a callback when the AFS syscall number is called?
Now, if you could suggest another way to have both the *experimental* 
in-kernel AFS client and OpenAFS client with mounted filesystems, please
let me know.
