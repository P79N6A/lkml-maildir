Hi Andrzej.

Note that Michael recently moved house/job and lost access to the
system he was working with in the process - he is in the process of
obtaining and configuring a replacement system as we speak.
As a result, any patches he was sent in the last six or seven weeks
are likely to have been mislaid by the time he is in a position to do
something about them...
Best wishes from Riley.
