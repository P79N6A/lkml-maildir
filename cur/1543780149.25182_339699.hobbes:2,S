We know that sleep(1) doesn't give us accurate sleep of 1 second, only close 
to it limited by Hz, schedule_timeout and how busy the kernel otherwise is.

None of that matters because the timing is done during a non sleep period 
using the real time clock:
	start_time = get_nsecs(&myts);
	burn_loops(loops);
	run_time = get_nsecs(&myts) - start_time;
So the time spent in sleep(1) should be irrelevant to the timing of 
loops_per_ms. Something else is happening to the cpu _during_ the sleep that 
makes the next lot of loops take a different length of time. That's the bit I 
haven't been able to figure out.
Cheers,
