then i'm just plain baffled.  using mozilla, i've tried downloading both 
2.4.15 and 2.5.0, from the main www.kernel.org page, and from the kernel
subpage.  in *every* case, the download window starts off fine with
"0K of 28716K", so it knows the right size at the beginning.
the download progresses until it reads 115K of ...K, there is a several
second pause, a brief flurry of activity, and the download terminates.
in *every* case, the final downloaded file is 155312 bytes long.
as i said, i can ftp just fine, but it sure is puzzling me why mozilla
is doing this.
ok, i'll shut up now.
