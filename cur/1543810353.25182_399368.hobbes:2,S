Hey!  Lunatic fringe indeed.  Harumph!  :-)
Yes, there are a few people out there who will need to issue really
large I/O reads or writes to get maximum I/O bandwidth on large
stripes.  The largest I've done so far is 4GiB, but I expect that
number will likely increase this year, and more likely next year,
if not.
