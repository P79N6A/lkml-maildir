Hmm, could you instead follow Andreas approach and have a
directory with little patches, that do _exactly_ one thing and a
file along to describe what is related, dependend and what each
patch does?
So people could try to suit them to their needs.
And they can tell you exactly _what_ change breaks instead of "It
doesn't work".
Thanks & Regards
