How can you protect the console from user that kills X with -9 (according
to the specification)? [ You can use xdm, but it keeps Xserver in memory
all the time :-( ] A lot of reboots of linux boxes in school labs are just
because someone typed kill -9 -1 in X (once I crashed one multi-user box
this way too :-)
