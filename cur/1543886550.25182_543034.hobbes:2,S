No, that's an error code from zlib:
#define Z_BUF_ERROR    (-5)
I think it means it got a truncated buffer while decompressing.

The hg verify checks the integrity of all the files by decompressing
them and making sure their sha1 hashes are correct.  The fact that the
first hg verify passed is a very strong check that the whole repo's
integrity is sound, both in structure and content.  The second failing
hg verify's messages are all related to truncation.  I haven't checked
this comprehensively, but in every instance I've checked the files are
identical up to the truncation point.  All the error messages are
consistent with pure truncation, not content differences or IO errors.
