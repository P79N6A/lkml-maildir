The apparent problem is that the git commit history on a branch cannot
be unwound.  However, that is fine - just make another branch and put
your new sequence of commits there.
Tools exist that allow you to wind and unwind the commit history
arbitrarily to revise patches before they are published on a branch that
you don't want to just delete.  For instance:
stacked git
  
http://www.procode.org/stgit/
or patchy git
  
http://www.spearce.org/2006/02/pg-version-0111-released.html
are examples of such tools.
I recommend starting with stacked git, it really is nice.
Sam.
