Have you tried waiting a bit longer - say five minutes. I just took a
look at this and it appears that both my x86 computers do actually turn
off after a while, acpi_power_off appears to make quite deep call chains
and abuse some slow functions.
It would be good to know if it actually works (although taking way too
long time) for you.
Thanks
