Thanks for all your work on this fine test suite.

Looking at the graph, it appears that your DSP load is hovering just
above 70% most of the time.  This happens to be the default threshold
for revoking realtime privileges.  Perhaps that is the problem.  Try
running it with the threshold set to 90%.  (I don't recall exactly
how, but I think there's a /proc/sys/kernel control somewhere.)

I'll take a look.  The old problem with more than 14 clients has been
fixed.  I routinely run 30 or 40 without trouble.  
Perhaps we're running out of some port resource?

Will do.
