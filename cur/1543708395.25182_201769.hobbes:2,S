The shutdown scripts on my system seem to be compensating for this. 
However, I'm hitting another problem where I do a pivot_root to a tmpfs 
filesystem and the shutdown scripts no longer know how to deal with it 
and try to unmount the real root filesystem from under themselves, 
causing all kinds of problems.
