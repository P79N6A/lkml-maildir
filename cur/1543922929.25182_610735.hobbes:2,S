Hmm. If I read this right, this bug seems to have been introduced by 
commit 65b8291c4000e5f38fc94fb2ca0cb7e8683c8a1b ("dio: invalidate clean 
pages before dio write") back in March.
Before that, we'd call invalidate_inode_pages2_range() unconditionally 
after the call mapping->a_ops->direct_IO() if it was a write and there 
were cached pages in the mapping (well, "unconditionally" in the sense 
that it didn't depend on the return value of the ->direct_IO() call).
However, with both the old and the new code _and_ with your patch, the 
return code - in case the invalidate failed - was corrupted. So we may 
actually end up doing some IO, but then returning the "wrong" error code 
from the invalidate. Hmm?
Somebody who cares about direct-IO and who - unlike me - doesn't think 
it's a total and idiotic crock should think hard about this. I'm including 
Karl's email, but also an alternate patch for consideration.
And maybe some day we can all agree that direct_IO is crap and should not 
be done.
