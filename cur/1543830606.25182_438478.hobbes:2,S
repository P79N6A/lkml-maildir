The i386 ones are a bit special... usually the reason I have added 
libgcc functions is that on some architectures, gcc has various problems 
linking with libgcc in some configurations.  That is not the case on 
i386, but some of the libgcc functions are *way* bigger than the need to 
be (overall, the quality of code in libgcc seems horrid, across 
architectures.)
Since i386 is such an important architecture I added a handful of 
assembly functions for stuff that could be done in a very small amount 
of space.
