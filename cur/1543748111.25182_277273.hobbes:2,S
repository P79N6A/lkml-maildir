i have released the -V0.7.32-6 Real-Time Preemption patch, which can be
downloaded from the usual place:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
this too is a fixes-only release.
Changes since -V0.7.32-4:
 - fixed a lock_kernel()-re-enables-interrupts bug reported by Daniel 
   Walker. The fix is to allow down() from irqs-off sections (and 
   save/restore irq flags) as long as there's no real contention on the
   semaphore.
 - fixed a /proc/latency_trace formatting bug reported by Mark H. 
   Johnson.
