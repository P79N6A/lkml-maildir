No, I think that assertion failure in journal_dirty_metadata() was more
than a once off, whatever that is.  There is probably something wrong in
there, but from a moderate-sized look I cannot see what it is.
Unless inspiration strikes we will need to wait until someone can hit it
with some sort of repeatability and then run with the ext3-debug patch
applied and enabled.

This will give a trace of what happened to that buffer and should allow me
to fix the bug.
