This is 2.6.6-rc3 on a sparc64. The warning has been there for quite
some time, finally got around to report it.
  CC [M]  drivers/media/video/video-buf.o
drivers/media/video/video-buf.c: In function `videobuf_iolock':
drivers/media/video/video-buf.c:327: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size
The specific code is
/* FIXME: need sanity checks for vb->boff */
bus   = (dma_addr_t)fbuf->base + vb->boff;
bus is dma_addr_t (==u32 on sparc64), base is void*
So if buf->base is really an arbitrary pointer, it might not fit into
u32. What is it actually?
