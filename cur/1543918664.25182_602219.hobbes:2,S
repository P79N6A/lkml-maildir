IMHO, containers have a subtly different purpose from LSM even though  
both are about information hiding.  Basically a container is  
information hiding primarily for administrative reasons; either as a  
convenience to help prevent errors or as a way of describing  
administrative boundaries.  For example, even in an environment where  
all sysadmins are trusted employees, a few head-honcho sysadmins  
would get root container access, and all others would get access to  
specific containers as a way of preventing "oops" errors.  Basically  
a container is about "full access inside this box and no access  
outside".
By contrast, LSM is more strictly about providing *limited* access to  
resources.  For an accounting business all client records would  
grouped and associated together, however those which have passed this  
year's review are read-only except by specific staff and others may  
have information restricted to some subset of the employees.
So containers are exclusive subsets of "the system" while LSM should  
be about non-exclusive information restriction.

I have seen more *wrong* iptables firewalls than I've seen correct  
ones.  Securing TCP/IP traffic properly requires either a lot of  
training/experience or a good out-of-the-box system like Shorewall  
which structures the necessary restrictions for you based on an  
abstract description of the desired functionality.  For instance what  
percentage of admins do you think could correctly set up their  
netfilter firewalls to log christmas-tree packets, smurfs, etc  
without the help of some external tool?  Hell, I don't trust myself  
to reliably do it without a lot of reading of docs and testing, and  
I've been doing netfilter firewalls for a while.
The bottom line is that with iptables it is *CRITICAL* to have a good  
set of interface tools to take the users' "My system is set up  
like..." description in some form and turn it into the necessary set  
of efficient security rules.  The *exact* same issue applies to  
SELinux, with 2 major additional problems:
1)  Half the tools are still somewhat beta-ish and under heavy  
development.  Furthermore the semi-official reference policy is  
nowhere near comprehensive and pretty ugly to read (go back to the  
point about the tools being beta-ish).
2)  If you break your system description or translation tools then  
instead of just your network dying your entire *system* dies.

Now see I think *THAT* is where Casey should be going with his SMACK  
code.  Don't add another LSM, start looking at SELinux and figuring  
out what parts he does not need and how they can be parameterized out  
at build time for smaller systems.
On the other hand, the "user" and "role" fields in SELinux are  
already fairly flexible.  The one constant is that user=>role and  
role=>type must both be allowed for a label to be valid.  Other than  
that, the constraints specify what must be true for a transition to  
be allowed.  For example the standard strict reference policy  
includes this bit:
constrain process transition (
	(u1 == u2) or
	(t1 == can_change_process_identity and t2 == process_user_target) or
	(t1 == cron_source_domain and (t2 == cron_job_domain or u2 ==  
system_u)) or
	(t1 == can_system_change and u2 == system_u) or
	(t1 == process_uncond_exempt)
);
Basically all constraints on a particular access vector must be  
satisfied for that to be allowed (in addition to other things).  For  
the above example, a process running exec() may only change its user  
if one of the following:
  * It's a login-like program and is starting a user entrypoint
  * It's a cron-like program and is starting a user or system cronjob
  * It's a process allowed to start system processes (admin runs  
initscripts)
  * It's unconditionally exempt
By creating types and assigning meaningful attributes to those types  
you may restrict the changing of the "user" and "role" however you  
would like, including not at all.
Really SELinux is just a fairly elaborate security state-machine.   
Each process on the system is in a given "state", defined by its  
label, and "state transitions" are only allowed based on the rules  
defined in the database.  Since there are 4 extremely common security  
models that people like to combine there are 4 fields in each SELinux  
label:
   (A)  User: User A may not poke user B's processes/data, even if  
they happen to be running in the same UNIX UID
   (B)  Role: Users may only perform operations for the role they are  
currently logged in as
   (C)  Type-enforcement: An apache process may only read files that  
it needs to operate correctly
   (D)  Multi-level:  Top-secret data can't magically become  
unclassified
Perhaps the thing to do would be to make it possible to compile out  
the portions which people don't want.  That would certainly satisfy  
Casey, he would build only the "Type-enforcement" portion or only the  
"Multi-level" portion and be able to do exactly the same things he  
does now with a bit finer granularity of operations.  By defining the  
lists of operations he cares about for "r" (read), "w" (write),  
"x" (exec), "a" (append), and requires-capabilities, you can just  
give those permissions directly in a simplified SELinux-type policy.

Well the major problem here is the performance one.  As anybody who  
has tried to do a thousand-linear-rule IPtables set will quickly tell  
you, it makes performance go all to hell.  Good iptables frontends  
like shorewall build little subchains to keep the fast-path as  
efficient as possible but regardless the search is a linear rule- 
traversal (IE: O(N) where N is the number of rules you had to test).   
In order to get good enough performance out of SELinux they had to  
*start* with an O(log(N) rule traversal which means that execution- 
order-style rules are impossible, so you *MUST* limit the fields and  
prevent any overlap between rules.  For example, in SELinux nobody  
writes "deny" rules because the interpretation-order is undefined.   
Instead you only write "allow" rules for the things you actually want  
to allow.  The one exception is "neverallow" rules which are verified  
at compile time as sanity checks and never actually loaded in the  
kernel.
