   Could you explain me how can 2.3.43 work? How do you do PCI-DMA
   over 2giga of ram on the page cache or on the buffer cache or in
   whatever else DMA with pci driver that is not yet using the new pci
   mmu code like some network driver is just doing?
It sounds just like the SCSI drivers need to be fixed to use
the new PCI dma interfaces, that's all.
I have such changes for the two biggies, aic7xxx and sym53c8xx.
Qlogic,ISP is already done and in Linus's tree.
Aic7xxx is tested and I just got merge permission from Doug Ledford.
The sym53c8xx needs a bit more testing/fixing, after which I'll submit
my changes to Gerard, it already is fully functional/working on
Sparc64.
Hey, Sparc64/PCI w/SCSI is broken because of this in Linus's tree as
well right now.  So what, tough, live with it, the whole purpose
behind these changes was to remove the restriction properly and fixing
all the PCI drivers up to use the new PCI dma interfaces.
You are free to help us in this process, but what you really should
not do is work on forward-porting the band-aid 2TB support hacks you
did for 2.2.x (which for 2.2.x was the correct way to do it) and
nullify all of the hard work we've been doing to fix this issue
properly.
Thanks.
Later,
