Wouldn't that lead to rather unstable positive feedback? I suspect that
you'd find that all semaphores used with spin_adapt() would pretty
quickly have timeouts set to 0 or infinity. 
It may well be somewhat non-deterministic, based on the amount of time
spent waiting at the first contention for each semaphore, and would be
very dependent on the value that you choose for the initial timeout
(i.e. all semaphores that take less than the initial timeout to acquire
in the first few contended cases would become spin locks, and those
that take longer than the initial timeout to acquire in the first few
contended cases would become normal semaphores).
You could possibly get more effective results if you based the timeout
adaptation on the difference between the times taken on the previous
and current attempts to acquire the lock - but that would hit the fast
path quite hard.
