I'm still far from convinced it covers all cases (see also Roland's example)
Arjan might be right for some modern graphics hardware, but there is
a lot more hardware out there than only this, old and new and non graphics
and graphics that Arjan didn't cover.
If Arjan was 100% right then PAT would not be needed at all. I wonder
why Venki/Suresh went through all the pain of resurrecting the old
PAT patchkit then!? Surely there is more about this.
