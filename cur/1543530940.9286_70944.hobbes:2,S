Well, I misspoke a bit.  Here's how sproc(2) and clone(2) work:
     pid_t sproc (void (*entry) (void *), unsigned inh, ...);
     int  __clone(int (*fn) (void *arg), void *child_stack, int
     flags, void *arg)
In both cases, you can specify how a stack is to be allocated.  The
entry/fn argument is the entry function for the child.  Return from
the entry function means the child exits.
On IRIX, if the child needs access to the parent's stack, you can
specify PR_BLOCK to ensure the parent only resumes running after the
child unblocks it with an unblockproc(2) call.
