Report:
1) It works somewhat better. irq doesn't get disabled.
2) however wlan card get disfunctional. I haven't been able to contact my wap
   even if i'm standing on it...
3) unplug has resulted in kernel panic (twice)
   (btw: how do I do to capture and report those)
4) when unlug don't produce kernel panic, then there is no way of power-oning that card again.
5) booting with the card inserted makes it not power on when yenta_socket is loaded (module)
comment: the card being disfunction could have something to with the driver.
but before it worked sometimes...

Some thoughts: (not I'm neither pcmcia nor linux expert).
The "irq storm", shouldn't that be "acked" in someway.
I.e. the card produced a lot of irq's (that get ignored)
isn't the "real" solution to capture them, and "do something clever"?
Instead of just "shutting the card down".
hmmm...wonder if that made sence
Question: Why do you think that it worked sometimes before?
/Jonas
ps.
	but the hook was/is nice :-)
