Hi,
I've been trying to get the latest RT preempt patch to compile on the
x86_64 platform. Previous posts have helped me get passed the errors
I've encountered, but I've just come up against a new one. I'm using
the config that I have previously posted, except now I have
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT set instead of CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY.
I now get the following error:
arch/x86_64/kernel/smpboot.c:191: error: section of 'tsc_sync_lock'
conflicts with previous declaration
I have patched the vanilla 2.6.12 kernel with
realtime-preempt-2.6.12-final-V0.7.51-28 patch file.
Let me know if any other info would help.
Cheers,
Steve Wooding.
