I think there is a mix of concept. In general, non-blocking != async. reads.
In tcp and over pipes (where non-blocking reads are mosrt often used), a
non-blocking read returning EAGAIN does _not_ do anything to ensure that
data will arrive later, and I think this fits nice into the description.
If you want asynchroneous I/O in userspace (and thats what I'm talking
about) than you should use the aio-functions and, yes, optimize them.
