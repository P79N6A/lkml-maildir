That's a bug in older 2.4 kernels.  You'll need to use a more recent
kernel, or change that put_page() to be a page_cache_release(),
or forward-port this chunk:
        /*
         * Yes, think what happens when other parts of the kernel take 
         * a reference to a page in order to pin it for io. -ben
         */
        if (PageLRU(page)) {
                if (unlikely(in_interrupt()))
                        BUG();
                lru_cache_del(page);
        }
to your __free_pages_ok().
The problem is that `put_page()' doesn't know how to deal with the
final release of a page which is on the LRU.  Someone else released
their reference, leaving access_process_vm() unexpectedly holding
the last reference to the page.  But it does put_page(), which then
says "why didn't you remove this page from the LRU?  BUG."
