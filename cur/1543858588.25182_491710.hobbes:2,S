2D worked the last time I tested it and fixed up all the problems, it
is slightly faster than nv, but may be more unstable, still only
single head... 3D even on x86 doesn't work yet without pre-loading
nvidia to set the hardware up correctly.. but it's coming along....
there are summary updates posted ~weekly on the nouveau wiki....
Dave.
