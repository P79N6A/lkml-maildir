Much better than /proc :)
However, we're already using /sys/devices/system/memory/ for memory
hotplug to represent Linux's view of memory, and which physical
addresses it is currently using.  I've thought about this before, and I
think that we may want to have /sys/.../memory/hardware for the DIMM
information and memory/logical for the memory hotplug controls.
One other minor thing.  You might want to think about referring to the
pieces of memory as things other than DIMMs.  On ppc64, for instance,
the hypervisor hands off memory in sections called LMBs (logical memory
blocks), and they're not directly related to any hardware DIMM.  The
same things will show up in other virtualized environments.
