The ptrace_list/ptrace_children list is the list of your natural children
that someone else has stolen by tracing them.  The "regular" child list is
all your natural children that noone has stolen, plus the ones you are
tracing.  We are talking here about an element on your "regular" child list
that is one you have stolen by tracing it, not a natural child.  If it is a
natural child, whether or not you are tracing it, this is not the case we
have been addressing so far.

I think you are talking about this case:
	#include <signal.h>
	#include <unistd.h>
	#include <sys/ptrace.h>
	int main (void)
	{
	  signal(SIGCHLD,SIG_IGN);
	  switch (fork()) {
	  case -1:perror("fork");return 2;
	  case 0: ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, 0, (char *) 1, 0); _exit(2);
	  default:
	    sleep(2);
	    return 0;
	  }
	}
This program leaves a leaked zombie around.  That is fixed by handling the
case in reparent_thread where it possibly calls do_notify_parent in the
same way as the forget_original_parent case.  Not surprising, as both
places have the same existing code to handle the same issue--and both
overlook the same case.  I've just tested a version of my prior patch that
covers this case as well, and it works.  I can give you either the
lock-reacquiring version of that or the version based on the
list-collection patch I just posted.

When did you wake up the tracer?  I don't see how that happened.  If the
tracer is blocked in a wait4 call and still has other live children, it
stays blocked.  Next time it wakes up for some other reason, it can poll
via a wait4 or ptrace call for each specific thread it knows it was
attached to and ascertain through ESRCH errors when one died.  
Having to do that sucks ass.
Thanks,
Roland
