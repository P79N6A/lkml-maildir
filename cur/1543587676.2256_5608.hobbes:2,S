    No, because then you can't write to the real first sector.
    Assuming translation is good, 1 0 2 3 4 is a better order.
    Then "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=1k count=999" will get
    rid of all this crap. Otherwise, killing it is difficult.
If you use EZdrive and damage its code, then probably you
cannot boot anymore, or lose access to your data.
Killing it must be difficult.
EZdrive provides uninstall code itself, but if you really want,
boot with "hda=noremap", and then your dd command will erase
both EZdrive and your precious data.
