Oh, ok. Multipathing is known to not work perfectly right in the mainstream
kernel. In this case, you might want to try the patch.

Oh, right. I misread your mail and just saw that the md1 was also on the same
devices. Strange indeed.

Well, IO errors would occur, be reported to the caller and those would
supposedly be noticed.
However, the 2.4 error reporting can't distinguish between a path or a device
error. So a failed read (destroyed block, for example) will fail a path. As
the read request is retried on all paths if necessary, it would be highly
undesireable to fail _all_ paths because of this. The last path will remain
"accessible", but the application will see an error in this case.

OK. Well, I never tested the QLogic proprietary failover because I consider it
to be the wrong approach ;-) The md layer should work though by now.
