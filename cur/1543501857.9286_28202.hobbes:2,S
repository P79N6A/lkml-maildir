	I do not seem to have the same behaviour if _directly_ creating
	a fifo on a NFS Solaris server :
	$ mkfifo p toto
	$ ls -l toto
	prw-rw-r--   1 danis    sig             0 Jul  3 19:57 toto
	Kernel is 2.2.10-ac4. Using 2.0.18 :
	$ mkfifo p toto
	$ ls -l toto
	-rw-rw-r--   1 danis    sig             0 Jul  3 19:59 toto
	So it seems to be a problem at least with 2.0.18.
