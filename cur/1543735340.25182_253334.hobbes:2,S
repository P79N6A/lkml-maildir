Not a lmbench, but:
#include <fcntl.h>
int main() {
    int fd;
    int i=100000;
    while(i--) {
        fd = open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY);
        close(fd);
    }
    return 0;
}
2.4:
# time ./openclose
real    0m7.455s
user    0m0.300s
sys     0m7.150s
2.6:
# time ./openclose
real    0m8.170s
user    0m0.370s
sys     0m7.800s
2.6 is at HZ=100 here. /etc is on ramfs.
configs are in attached tarball.
