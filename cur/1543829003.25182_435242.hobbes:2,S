I try compile 2.6.17-mm1 with almost(make oldconfig) the same config as 
linux-2.6.17-rc6-mm2.
After that I got:
 GEN     usr/klibc/syscalls/typesize.c
  KLIBCCC usr/klibc/syscalls/typesize.o
  OBJCOPY usr/klibc/syscalls/typesize.bin
  GEN     usr/klibc/syscalls/syscalls.mk

  KLIBCCC usr/klibc/syscalls/typesize.o

during 10-15 minutes, after that I just type "Ctrl+C".
Config in attachment.
What's may be wrong? I can successfully compile 
linux-2.6.17-rc6-mm2.
