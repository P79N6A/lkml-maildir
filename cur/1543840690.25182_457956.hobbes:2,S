What are you talking about here ? That is the write side. You are
*not* supposed to do lock_cpu_hotplug() in cpu callbacks paths AFAICT. 
If someone does it (like cpufreq did), it is just *wrong*.

I am talking about readsides here - you read cpu_online_map and
block then reuse the map and make some calls to another subsystem
that may again do a similar read-side cpu_hotplug lock. I suspect
that it hard to get rid of all possible dependencies.

Do cpu hotplugs in a one cpu and change frequencies in another -
I think Gautham has a script to reproduce this. Besides
lockdep apparently complains about it -

Really, the hotplug locking rules are fairly simple-
1. If you are in cpu hotplug callback path, don't take any lock.
2. If you are in a non-hotplug path reading cpu_online_map and you don't
   block, you just disable preemption and you are safe from hotplug.
3. If you are in a non-hotplug path and you use cpu_online_map and
   you *really* need to block, you use lock_cpu_hotplug() or 
   cpu_hotplug_disable whatever it is called.
Is this too difficult for people to follow ?

No it doesn't. Perhaps we should just document the rules better
and put some static checks for people to get it right.
