Hi
Can anyone offer any suggestions on a possible RAMDISK bug I have seen.
I wish to boot a system from a flash IDE drive into a 16Meg RAMDISK on a 
system with 32 Meg installed. I have modified drivers/block/rd.c and 
commented out the line that checks for a floppy as the root dev, this 
allows me to at least load a compressed filesystem image from an HD into 
RAMDISK.
The system I have uses about 11 meg of the 16. You would imagine I have a 
little less than 16Meg available for application use. Actually I have 
a few processes running from boot and free reports only about 6Meg 
left.
I tried running some programs that would allocate memory until failure to 
confirm what was really available (because I though 6 was a little low)
I wrote a program that would malloc single large blocks. With this I can 
malloc 23 Meg before failure. (malloc returns NULL)
Thinking there was a problem, I changed this to use calloc instead. If I
tried to calloc more than 10 Meg, the machine locked up. Between 6 and 10 it
would usually keep going for a while, but lock up later. I tried running
these programs as nobody rather than root. Same result. If I were running any
other programs (eg 'top') in another session, this would usually bomb with a
bus error at the same time. The callocing app might also bomb with a bus
error before the machine locked. I am doing this stuff over a telnet session,
I haven't tried it on a console. 
It is as if the RAMDISK code as not marked the buffers it uses as 
unavailable for app code. I looked through the code and see it sets the 
BH_Protected flag in the file buffer structs. However I also see that 
there are 2 or 3 places (fs/buffers.c and somewhere in ext2 hierarchy) 
where these can be cleared.
Can anyone offer any help/comments/suggestions ?
Many thanks
