Hi,
In tcp_input.c, I declare a variable,
double t_owd_; 
t_owd_ = rcv_tsecr - rcv_tsval;
But in this case, the right side in the equation are integrals,
which is against to the left side of double.
I tried, 
t_owd_ = (double) rcv_tsecr - (double) rcv_tsval;
It didn't work. How could I do to make it?
Thank you.
