In some cases, they show remarkable reluctance to embrace change,
though. Just consider the enthusiastic response of RIAA, MPAA, etc.
to how the Internet has improved everybody's ability to distribute
information.
Anyway, the question is then what the current trends are. As Linus
has pointed out, there are desirable and there are undesirable
uses of DRM. If endorsing DRM will just get us flooded with the
undesirable ones, plus an insignificant number of the desirable
ones, we'll have made a lousy deal.
