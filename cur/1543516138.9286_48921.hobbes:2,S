Hmmm. My PS/2 56slc2 (Integrated SCSI) with 1 200 MB IBM
disk and one 1 GB Fujitsu disk doesn't boot anything greater
than v2.3.22.

I haven't tried v2.3.26, but v2.3.23 & 25 panic'ed when
probing for the drives. The bad performance is probably due to
the memory subsystem rewrite. I wouldn't worry too much; I'm sure
it'll be fixed soon.

I'm experiencing the same problems here, but I suspect that it's
nothing specific for MCA, but rather the new zone-allocator, or
something else in the new memory handling.
I'll wait for v2.3.28 or 29 before starting to complain wildly
about this behaviour, but the non-working SCSI is a little worse.
It's one thing if most of the world has problems, it's another
thing if it's just me...
