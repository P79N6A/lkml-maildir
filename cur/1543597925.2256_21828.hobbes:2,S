Restricting CPU usage alone can be done relatively easily during
recalculate . Before renewing the counter for a task, a quick check could
be made against a newly added user-specific limit. If very precise
accounting is not needed, the check could be done by one of the periodic
daemons.....
But a bigger question remains : will doing this achieve the objective of
isolating a malicious/errant process ? There are a number of other system
resources that the process/user could overuse to the detriment of other
users/processes.

at server level, this feature will be used for virtual hosts (a lot of
ISP's). Could be used at home for security reason limitting any user
95-97%,
and box will be more secure. A lot of people use applications (for XFree)
that could crash the box for this reason.
