It was my point. I don't know what your point was.

I wasn't proposing fully dynamic slabs, just a better default set
of slabs based on real measurements instead of handwaving (like
the power of two slabs seemed to have been generated). With separate
sets for 32bit and 64bit. 
Also the goal wouldn't be better performance, but just less waste of memory.
I suspect such a move could save much more memory on small systems 
than any of these "make fundamental debugging tools a CONFIG" patches ever.
