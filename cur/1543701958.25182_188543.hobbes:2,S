Ah, I must have missed that point. Indeed that is very odd. When booting
without the clock= what time source is used? Does booting w/
"clock=crazy" also show the problem?

No, my patch is just against 2.6.1-rc1 (really I should have checked if
it applies onto mm2, but I didn't). Due to the misunderstanding above,
I'm actually more interested in the questions I just asked then if the
last patch worked (but if you're feeling bored, don't let me stop you
from testing it :)
