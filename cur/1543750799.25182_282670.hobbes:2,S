I made no such claim. I claimed that the posted fix was wrong:

This is wrong because strlen() already returns a size_t (unsigned).
This "fix" only served to quiet the compiler which was warning
about the conversion. It is a "conversion", not a "promotion".
The simple fix to quiet this conversion warning is to use 1U
as previously shown.
