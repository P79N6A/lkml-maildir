Lee Tong,
I'm no specialist on IPsec, but isn't it available already outside the 
great wall? Generally you should consult the file 
/usr/src/linux/MAINTAINERS to specifically address persons about 
specific parts of the code, or send mail to linux-
kernel@vger.kernel.org. Also in /usr/src/linux/Documentation you can 
find a lot of information and pointers to more.

If not for speed, you can avoid all your gotos.

I have no idea whether single stepping interrupt routines works well.
Generally it's wise to add syslog output to trace your program flow. It 
works from interrupt if the amount of output is not too much.

P.S. I'll CC: the message to linux-kernel, so maybe one of the 
enlighted will share some of their light.
