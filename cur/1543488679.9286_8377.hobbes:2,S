No.  I have an AMD K6-200 and I've overclocked it to 250.  I have
a ball bearing fan with an integrated heatsink.  If I get Linux
to really burn with kernel compiles, crashme, and other intensive
stuff, the heatsink only gets slightly warm.

Since when has Intel been known for providing chips that run
cool?  They never have to my knowledge.  AMD chips are far
superior to Intel's IMHO, both in quality, and in innovation.
Now the market is finally realizing that and everyone going with
AMD.  The K7 will be very interesting.
