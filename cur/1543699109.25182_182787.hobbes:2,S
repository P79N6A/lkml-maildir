Same here, this crypto stuff rocks!
I posted a document and some sources for using the high throughput
entropy source on linux (2.4.23 and 2.4.6test9) here:
    
http://peertech.org/hardware/viarng/
The stock hw_random.c needs a few tweaks to support 8 byte xstore,
and I wrote a new userspace entropy daemon to support low latency,
high volume throughput.  I should clean the code up so it is usable...
