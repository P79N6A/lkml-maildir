Con complained about that one too, rightly so.  If you look more recently you 
will see that the default is actually now '0' so nice'd processes do count 
towards the business calculation....I guess I could submit *another* more or 
less duplicate patch to really confuse things to rename the sysfs entry again 
and it to expect a huge prime number to ignore nice'd processes ;)
Guess you can go back to your initscript and remove that entry :P
Cheers
