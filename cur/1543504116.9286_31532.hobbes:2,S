Subject: [patch] 2.3.12-pre7: make joy-db9 work again
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andree, list,
Here is a quick patch to make joy-db9 work again.  It's untested, as I
don't actually have a console joystick, but it should work.
Note that JS_PAR_CTRL_OUT now does _two_ port accesses instead of one.
This can only really be avoided by re-writing some code in joy-db9.c so
that we set the data direction only when we need to.
Tim.
