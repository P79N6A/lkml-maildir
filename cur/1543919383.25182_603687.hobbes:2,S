This is really what disturbs me this solution: the same check will be 
done several times. But is true that we have to do something.
So why not simply adding a BIG COMMENT before the msg_queue, sem_array 
and shmid_ds stating that the kern_ipc_perm should stay at the beinnign 
of the structure?
Will try to look for another solution.
