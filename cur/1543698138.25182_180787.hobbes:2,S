You need to prevent deadlocks. Imagine process A grabbing a spinlock, then
getting preempted. Process B now sits there and waits on the spinlock.
Forward progress may or may not happen when the scheduler preempts B and
restarts A, some indeterminate time later.
Scheduling when waiting for a spinlock doesn't make sense because usually
the spinlock is held for just a few cycles (that's why it's a spin lock
and not a semaphore / wait queue / whatever), and rescheduling would take
more time than just waiting.
