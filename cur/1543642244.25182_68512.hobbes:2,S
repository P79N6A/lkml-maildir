The NMI oopser is going here as well (nmi_watchdog=2 for extra safety)
so I suspect the tasklist_lock semantics are behaving badly. But it's
not easily reproducible enough to test a quick attempt at a fix if it
can't be recognized a priori.
This is literally so difficult to reproduce it hasn't been seen in 2
releases. kgdb is still going and dhowells is helping me fish stuff
off the stack.
Cheers,
Bill
