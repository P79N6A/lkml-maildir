Hi all,
I have Red Hat 6.0 and linux kernel 2.2.9 with atm 0.59 patch.
My problem is that apparently I have configured the kernel for using the
ethertap device (say ´y´ to options: "Prompt for development and/or
incomplete code/drivers", "Kernel/User netlink socket", "Ethertap
network tap") but when I try to run an instruction
"open("/dev/tap0",O_RDWR)" it says:  "Operation not supported by
device".
Previously I had make the ´mknod /dev/tap0 c 36 16´ and the ´ifconfig
tap0 15.35.x.x netmask 255.255.255.0 up arp´ (following the instructions
in Documentation/networking/ethertap.txt) and everything went OK until I
try to open it from my piece of code.
Is there any bug for the kernel version that I have that I have missed.
Could somebody give me a clue about what is going on?
Thanx in advance
Best Regards
    Elena
