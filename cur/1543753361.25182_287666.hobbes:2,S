Linus,
I would like to try to get these patches into 2.6.11.  They add 
infrastructure for all ppc sub-archs to use platform_devices instead of 
OCP.  Additionally, I've converted the 85xx sub-arch and gianfar enet 
driver (used by 85xx) over to using platform_device and the new 
infrastructure.
The sooner these get in the easier it will be to convert the other 
sub-archs and drivers to platform_device and remove OCP.
