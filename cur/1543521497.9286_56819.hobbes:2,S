Hi guys,
I was looking at the code and it looks like Linux vfat filesystem can't
deal with the filesystems created, e.g. on MO devices with sector
size=2048. Surely that can't be true so I wanted to just plain ask - can
one create (using win9x) a vfat filesystem on a MO device with sector=2048
and then read/write in Linux vfat and then hope that it still works in
windows?
Regards,
