Hello,
After applying patch-2.4.17-pre8 on the stock kernel-2.4.16 and 
recompiling with AACRAID enabled and rebooting, all goes well except for 
the tons and tons of the following messages which appears whenever I 
typed DMESG at the shell prompt. The machine in question is a dual CPU 
Dell PowerEdge 2550 with an AACRAID controller in place.
Does anyone know how to get rid of these messages or are they indicative 
of some bugs in the system?
Many thanks in advance for any advice or help.
