All of this HAVE_ARCH_xxx stuff gave Linus heartburn a few weeks ago,
and you're massively increasing its proliferation.
How about putting each class of bitop into its own header file in
asm-generic, and getting the arches that need each one to include the
specific files it needs in its own bitops.h header?
For example, the hweight stuff would go into
asm-generic/bitops-hweight.h, and then asm-foo/bitops.h would just use
#include <asm-generic/bitops-hweight.h>
or else define its own if it didn't need the generic versions.
