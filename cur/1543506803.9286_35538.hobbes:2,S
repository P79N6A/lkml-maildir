I notice when doing a make menuconfig there is a new option for Misc
devices which doesn't do anything.  It cant be set, and there doesn't
seem to be anything there.  The Makefile in the drivers/misc
subdirectory seems either broken or incomplete.  The last line in that
file is
fastdep:
Do I have a broken patch somewhere, did I read it wrong, or is there
something else going on here?
