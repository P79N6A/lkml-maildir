I really like the HPT366 that is built onto my Abit BE6. It seems to be faster
than the BX chipset on non-UDMA/66 devices too. It only uses one interrupt and
runs very well under Windows.
About the technical aspects of the chipsets, I have no idea. I just know that
this little board is quite a work of art.
