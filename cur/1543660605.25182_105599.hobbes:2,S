Hi Nick, Andrew, lists,
I've been testing some recent kernels to see how they compare with a 
particular database workload.  The workload is actually part of our 
production process (last months run) but on a test server.  I'll describe 
the platform and the workload, but first, the results :-)

-------------    ----------- ---------------------------------
2.4.20-aa1       134         i consider this 'baseline'
2.5.59           124         woo-hoo
2.4.18-19.7.xsmp 128         not bad for frankenstein's montster
2.5.59-mm5       157         uh-oh
Platform:
HP LH3000 U3.  Dual 866 Mhz Intel Pentium III, 2GB ram.  megaraid 
controller with two channels, each channel raid 5 PV on 6 15k scsi disks, 
one megaraid LV per PV.
Two plain disks w/pairs of partitions in raid 1 for OS (redhat 7.3), a 
second pair for Oracle redo-log (in a log 'group').
Oracle version 8.1.7 (no aio support in this release) is accessing
datafiles on the two megaraid devices via /dev/raw stacked on top of
device-mapper 
Workload:
The workload consists of a few different phases.
1) Indexing: multiple indexes built against a 9 million row table.  This
is mostly about sequential scans of a single table, with bursts of write
activity.  50 minutes or so. 
2) Analyzing: The database scans tables and
builds statistics.  Most of the time is spent analyzing the 9 million row
table.  This is a completely cpu bound step on our underpowered system.  
30 minutes. 
3) Summarization: the large table is aggregated in about 100
different ways.  Records are generated for each different summarization.  
This is mixed read-write load.  50 minutes or so.
I'll test any kernel you throw my way.
David
