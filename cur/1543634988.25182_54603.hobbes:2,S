Normally I'd expect the device driver to forcibly unlink
anything it's started.  Failing that, the host controller
will often fail the transfer if the device is gone.  (But
I seem to recall recent speculation about maybe one of the
UHCIs not doing that.)
In either case, the device driver should block until all
its pending URBs complete.
