Yes, as Robin pointed out, this patch was sent to LKML at least 3 times
including Bernd's email. This is the 4th round.

I don't wanna to resend it again and again to annoy the receiver and
LKML. But IMO, technically this patch looks fine to binfmt_flat and
other architectures. And the in-tree Blackfin port will fail to be
compiled with this patch if the BINFMT_FLAT is enabled.

Yes, I will try my best to avoid this happen again. But on the other
hand, several reasons made this mess happen:
a) not very easy found the maintainer information for several domain,
for example this patch should invite binfmt_flat maintainers, arch
maintainers (Thanks Robin to invite them), blackfin port maintainers and
toolchain maintainers.
b) even the maintainers got this patch email, they don't have time to
review or reply. So the patch was ignored by LKML and the sender, sorry
-:))).
c) There is a rule that do __NOT__ send the same patch again and again,
I don't wanna to break this rule. But if there is no feedback about the
patch, we have no choice but resent it or just ignore it.
I know it is general problem in the LKML patch review.
Thanks
