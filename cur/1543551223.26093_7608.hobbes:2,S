Heh.. now all we need is some smart-arse to make something similar to
apply to the _entire_ VM subsystem, and both Rik and Andrea can be happy
;)
Seriously, am I missing something obvious or is it far simpler just to
keel over and die if the system goes OOM?  I mean, seriously, if the
administrator lets it get to that state then he/she/it deserves a dead
system.  It's akin to having your car run out of petrol - you don't
start shooting passengers because their extra load made the engine chew
more.  You pack up your kitty and go to the nearest petrol station and
buy more, plug it into the car then learn from the experience so this
fringe case of it happening doesn't happen again.  I don't really see
much difference between a car going "OOP" and a computer going OOM.
Should we start deleting files according to some randomly-chosen
heueristic if a filesystem goes "OOS" ?
