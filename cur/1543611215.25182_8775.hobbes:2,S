Oops.
[PATCH] fix for drivers/char/pc_keyb.c in 2.5.1-pre3
2.5.1-pre3 would not compile without Alan's patch for pc_keyb.c, etc.
I also noticed the logfile LTP "runalltests" was writing to has binary 
data and snippets of kernel code in it.  (Normally it would all be text).
This was on a reiserfs system, btw.
