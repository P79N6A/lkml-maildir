Fedora used to be on an ancient version of the headers, forked and
manually sanitised from 2.4 some time ago and manually (but
inconsistently) updated to date with new syscalls &c as and when bugs
got filed against the package.
As of two days ago, Fedora is using the result of 'make headers_install'
instead. Speaking as maintainer of Fedora's glibc-kernheaders, I think
it's a massive improvement, 
Other distributions look like they should be able to change too -- the
whole point in approaching them before implementing this was to confirm
that they'd be happy with it. I don't know _when_ that'll happen though.
Obviously it makes sense for them to wait while I use Fedora rawhide as
a test bed.
