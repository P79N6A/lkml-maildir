That turns out not to be the case.  It was exactly this granularity
problem which killed the only machine I'm aware of which did DSM in
hardware (the Kendall Square boxes --- and how many people here have
heard of that one? :)

Have you _seen_ the effort people go to to avoid cache line effects on
SMP?  In the 2.3 kernel right now, people are devoting *huge* amounts
of effort to dealing with this, it is so expensive.  And that's just
flipping 32-byte cache lines over fast hardware buses.  It's really
hard to deal with there, so how much more painful is the effect if
your granularity is the page and your bus runs over IP?
And if you say "well good DSM code can be aware of it and work around
the problems" then you've just eliminated the one advantage we agree
on about DSM --- that it is easy to program to.
