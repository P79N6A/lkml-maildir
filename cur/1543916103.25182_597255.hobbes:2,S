In general I agree, but as the number of cores increases dramatically,
hitting a warning/BUG/oops simultaneously on multiple cores (especially
during development) becomes more of a problem.
At least to me, It's not rare that when working on 8C or above machine,
an oops message becomes completely unreadable due to multiple debug
printks that trash the serial port output. 
Never the less, I do agree that this problem is more developer related
and should not hit an end user running a debug-free distribution kernel.

True.
My aim is to create a patch that
A. Doesn't break the current interface/APIs while keeping the
patch/noise to a minimum.
B. Does not cause any type of regression.

I fully agree.

Hopefully the latest patch moves one step further in removing your
concerns.

If I cannot find a working solution that does meet my initial goals
(Minimal patch/no regression) I'll start from scratch - creating a new
trace call path.
