OK. Let's stop at configfs interface to move...

I propose to discuss this question as this is the most important
now from my point of view.
I believe this can be done, but can't imagine how to use this...

I propose such a solution: if a user asks to move /proc/<pid>
then move the whole task with threads.
If user asks to move /proc/<pid>/task/<tid> then move just
a single thread.
What do you think?
