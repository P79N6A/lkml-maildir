arm26 seems to be the only arch which uses slab for pts other than ppc64.
But (without fully working it out) I think sparc (32) may also use page
parts: never mind slab using page->lru, I'm utterly broken using fields
of one struct page for two or more page tables, union or overlay or not.
So as well as reverting my poisonous patch, we'll need the patch at the
bottom, at least for now.  We could almost keep my poisonous patch (but
I expect you're well on your way reverting it), except for how it uses
the unsplit config to test the split - we could suppress its poisoning
and verification when ARM26 || SPARC32 || PPC64.  If reverting turns
out to be tiresome, then that would be another direction to try.

I think they use slab, not for speed, but because they only need a
fraction of PAGE_SIZE for the page table - easy to imagine that in
the case of Ben's 64kB ppc64 pages, and he did mention that he was
trying to get away from the idea that a page table was a page.

Suppress split ptlock on arches which may use one page for multiple page
tables.  Reconsider what better to do (particularly on ppc64) later on.
