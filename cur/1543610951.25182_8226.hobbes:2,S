Well, there are cases, where -1 and (-1) make a difference (see below)
but these are extremely unlikely to appear in the kernel src code.
Thus, I also think these patches are unnecessary.
For example,
    int *p;            and       int *p
    -1[p];                       (-1)[p];
are both valid and compilable code segments, with no undefined or
implementation-defined behavior (as long as p points to an element of
an array other than the first and last), and both code segments do
different things.

ack.
