Ouch.  Just got the same here.  After running 2.2.0p2 for a while
booting into W98 reports C: full and registry errors.  Scandisk
reported boot track corrupted...which might cause misreported space
and fixed it.
I have no idea what details may help...
	C: Maxtor 8.4GB disk with IRQ's on
	D: Maxtor 3.8GB disk with IRQ's on
	no lilo, starts linux from loadlin
	P2-266, 64MB
	DE4x5 runs eth0, switched away from tulip
	as many modules as possible
