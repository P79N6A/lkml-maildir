if you install a program or a driver that needs uinput loaded, then you
have a clean requirement. So simply add a "modprobe uinput" to its init
script.
Look at the TUN/Tap driver which has the same problem. The boot up
scripts of various daemons (for example OpenVPN etc.) are making sure
that the driver is loaded.
