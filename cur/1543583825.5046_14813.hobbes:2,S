No, the present definition is terrible.
Read the mkswap source. A forest of #ifdefs,
and still sometimes user assistance is required
because mkswap cannot always figure out what the "pagesize" is.
There are two main problems:
(i) "new" swap is hardly larger than "old" swap
(ii) the unit in which new swap is measured is a mystery
So, the next swap space has (i) a signature "SWAPSPACE3",
(ii) (not strictly necessary) a size given as a 64-bit number in bytes.
Moreover, the swapon call must not refuse swapspaces
that are larger than the kernel can handle.
