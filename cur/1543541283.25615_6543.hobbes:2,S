Now that you mention it, I do remember it.  I forgot about
it.  Balsa *IS* a broken mailer.  Talk about the water calling
the kettle black eh?  Heheh..  ;o)
Homey says WHO should fix their mailer?  Shit, MS Outlook doesn't
munge messages as bad as that.  Balsa is nothing more than a very
light wood used in modelling.  From what I see, it should stay
that way.  ;o)

Yessiree.. I use PINE, and have my right margin set to 72 I
think.  It was 65 but it seems an upgrade changed it.  I like 65
better - for sending.  As long as things don't go jaggies or all
on one line in received mails, they get read.  Most other times I
just hit delete.  If someone says "tough luck" they will end up
hitting my killfile instantly, and likely a good portion of the
rest of their readership.

Damned straight!  I am on 40-50 mailing lists and I don't have
time for mail that doesn't follow common Netiquette.  I'd like to
write a new procmailrc called "pm-netiquette" that automatically
files all RFC1855 non-conforming mail into a junk file that gets
extreme low priority.
