I always get worried when I see a spinlock around a simple assignment like
this - it often doesn't make a lot of sense and can indicate that
something's wrong.

Indenting went wrong.
urgh, maybe it just looks wrong because someone's being inserting spaces
instead of tabs.

We have kzalloc() now.

Again, it looks wrong but is probably OK due to broken tab key.
Do you want the code to go in like this or do you want to clean it up?
