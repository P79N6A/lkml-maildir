Subject: Problem with include files in 2.3.17.

I contacted David Hinds (the PCMCIA maintainer) about these errors and
he wrote back:
	Hmmm, this looks to me like some sort of include file 
	goof-up, not specific to PCMCIA.  These spin lock 
	definitions should not be in both <linux/spinlock.h> 
	*and* <asm/spinlock.h>, I'd think.
