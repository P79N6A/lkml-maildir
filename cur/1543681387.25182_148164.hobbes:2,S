Sorry, but I think that is nonsense. This is the way we have always
worked. You just have to maintain a decent queue length still (like we
always have in 2.4) and there are no problems.

It is _not_ unsafe, stop spewing nonsense like that. The patch should
not be applied, it's just the first few things I did to see if it would
make a difference like I described. And it had a big effect, so I posted
results and went to bed. Know we have a grounds for further discussion,
and I'll bench the changes seperately too as well. It's about getting
data points you can use, you have to try extremese as well.

Sigh... No I don't want 90/10 distribution of course, that would be
silly.
