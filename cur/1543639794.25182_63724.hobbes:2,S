FYI, we do have this sytem up and running.
If it's a PERC3-DI, then the raid driver is the aacraid as this is the
ROMB raid, basically a firmware addon to the adaptec scsi on board (IIRC).
For PERC3-DC or PERC3-QC the driver is the AMI megaraid driver.
The tg3 driver included with 2.4.19 works for the Broadcom
NetXtreame BCM5701 (Broadcom 570x).
This system has the ServerWorks GC and is a P4 therefore hyperthreading
does work.  2.4.19 so far seems very stable, but to balance IRQs
across all the CPUs you will need Ingo Molnars IRQ balancing patches.  His
patch, as applied to 2.4.19, can be found at
http://www.hardrock.org/kernel/irqbalance-2.4.19-MRC.patch
Also, remember to compile in support for IDE CD and the CSB5 IDE chipset.
This is the patch that I am currently testing on a single system.
With heavy load on the disk, memory, and CPU (~19 load average for the
past 3 days now) the system is still responsive and seems very stable.
I can send the .config I am currently using if you wish.
