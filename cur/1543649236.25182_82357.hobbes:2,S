Hi Kahlid,
I've actually been using a similar (albiet not as complex) solution based on 
a patch[1] I forward ported to 2.5 from WOLK[2].  You might want to have a 
look at it, since the nice thing about it was that the .conf file was 
compressed via gzip prior to inclusion in the kernel.  Thus the memory 
footprint was reduced as well.  Another neat attribute was the "make 
cloneconfig" command which was included in the top-level Makefile.  
Basically it would parse /proc/blah.gz and send the information directly to 
Config, generating the configuration non-interactively.  Not a big deal, 
just one less step in the scheme of things.  Otherwise, I'd say it looks 
good to me.
Cheers,
Nicholas
