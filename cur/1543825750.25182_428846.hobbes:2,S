The "no idea" is hardly reassuring ;-)
The latter point is definitely valid though, it's not an isolated issue.

because it's not maintainable in a fully automated system over time.

Above is a good description of the problem - I really want to get as
much debugging stuff done automatically as possible. However, we can
have both. We just need to do both runs, with an option to turn
whatever the random debug options of the day on or off are. Something
that won't change over time. CONFIG_DEBUG itself would seem ideal,
except it kills lots of standard things like CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO,
alt+sysrq support, and probably KALLSYMS and a few other things I
forget. Need CONFIG_DEBUG_AFFFECTS_PERFORMANCE or something.

Is all good, is just frustrating on occcasion, sorry ;-) The problem is
that especially in a remote, distributed system, it's impossible to
maintain a continually changing set of config options for this over
time. If we can get one option to flick off all the perf invasive
stuff, that's a single change. If we have to add CONFIG_SLAB last week,
CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEX this week, and CONFIG_LOCK_DEBUG_STUFF next week,
that gets much, much harder to maintain.
Hopefully that makes some sort of sense. Sorry, I realise the
requirements are a little strange, but I really think we have to
get testing automated or it just does not happen. The last round
affected Intel, etc as well doing benchmarking.
Adding new runs is easy. Changing the harness is hard ;-)
