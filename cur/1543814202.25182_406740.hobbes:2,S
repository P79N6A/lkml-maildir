Hello,
my board (Gigabyte K8N Pro SLI) has the latest Award BIOS ("F9"), but the kernel 
(SuSE Linux 10.0) keeps telling me during boot:
[...]
<7>PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:0b.0 to 64
<4>pcie_portdrv_probe->Dev[005d:10de] has invalid IRQ. Check vendor BIOS
<4>assign_interrupt_mode Found MSI capability
<7>Allocate Port Service[pcie00]
<7>PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:0c.0 to 64
<4>pcie_portdrv_probe->Dev[005d:10de] has invalid IRQ. Check vendor BIOS

<7>PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:0d.0 to 64

<7>PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:0e.0 to 64

<7>Allocate Port Service[pcie00]
[...]
What is the message really about, and how does a proper BIOS fix look like? What 
is the name of that invalid IRQ? ;-) I can only assume that an unpopulated PCI 
express slot has no IRQ assigned at all.
