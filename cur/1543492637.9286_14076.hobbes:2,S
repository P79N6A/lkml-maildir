Yes, it happens fairly often on my machine, mostly when the network is down for
a while -- with kernels 2.0.3x and 2.2.x.  I use 3 X displays, and when a link
to one of the two remote servers breaks, the screen/keyboard system freezes.
It's sometimes recoverable locally but it generally implies telnetting from
another host and rebooting... which always works. So it seems purely X-related.
