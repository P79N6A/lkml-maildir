Hi folks,
I'd like to build some authentication daemon which alters the
privileges of another process (like factotum does on plan9).
But I couldn't find any interface for that (setuid() and friends
only operate on the current process). So I'm now going to create
my own interface.
As a little learning example I just added a few files to the
per-pid dirs: uid, euid, suid, fsuid. This was trivial :)
Now I'd like to add an write capability to these files: 
simply writing another number changes the (|s|fs)uid.
But this doesnt seem that trivial. Perhaps someone could give
me some advice ?
