On x86_64 the sizes is actually 64K for executable binaries if I
recall correctly.  It certainly is not PAGE_SIZE, so we have some
flexibility there.

But we still have some issues with mmap. But since we could increase
PAGE_SIZE on x86_64 and not have to even worry about sub PAGE_SIZE
mmaps.  It is being suggested that if people really need larger
physical pages that they just fix PAGE_SIZE.  The everything just
works.
Thinking about it changing PAGE_SIZE on x86_64 should be about as
hard as doing the 3-level vs 2-level page table format.  We say
we have a different page table format that uses a larger PAGE_SIZE.
All arch code, all code in paths that we expect to change.
Boom all done.
It might be worth implementing just so people can play with different
PAGE_SIZE values for benchmarking.
I don't think the larger physical page size is really the issue here
though.

Perhaps.

Partially but also partially they are very much suggesting going down
the same path.  Currently mmap doesn't work with order >0 pages because
they are not yet addressing these issues at all.
This looks like a more flexible version of the old PAGE_CACHE_SIZE >
PAGE_SIZE code.  Which makes seriously question the whole idea.
