not for me :-( it works fine with the "broken" kernel module)
sane-find-scanner find it:
found USB scanner (vendor=0x04b8 [EPSON],
product=0x011b [EPSON Scanner]) at libusb:001:002
but scaniimage -L don't.
With the kernel module loaded i get:
device `epkowa:/dev/usb/scanner0' is a Epson GT-9300 flatbed scanner
What do i miss?
Perhaps somebody who knows should rewrite Documentation/usb/scanner.txt
for the benefit of us "pauvres mortels".
Thanks!
