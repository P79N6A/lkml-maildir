New console flag: CON_BOOT
CON_BOOT is like early printk in that it allows for output really
early on.  It's better than early printk because it unregisters
automatically when a real console is initialised.  So if you don't get
consoles registering in console_init, there isn't a huge delay between
the boot console unregistering and the real console starting.  This is
the case on PA-RISC where we have serial ports that aren't discovered
until the PCI bus has been walked.
I think all the current early printk users could be converted to this
scheme with a minimal amount of effort.

"Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon 
the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
