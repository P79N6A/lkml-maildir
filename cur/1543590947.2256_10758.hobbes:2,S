Time will make that decision. Linus kindly gave us all the power to vote with
our feet. One thing I absolutely refuse to do is to let a disagreemnt over
some specific device implementation turn into an excuse for a wider difference
in the trees.
So yes -ac might have static majors but the rest of it I intend to keep merging
with Linus and tracking closely to his tree. Certainly not ignoring the -linus
tree.
