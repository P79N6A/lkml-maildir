Fixed. Applied. I missed it when I was applying your patches by hand. My 
tree was way to different to accept your patches.

Cool. Needed really bad. Applied.

I agree. The problem is the upper layer of the console system is to brain 
dead. Its either erase the cursor or redraw it again. There is no way to 
just say cursor just moved. There is a CM_MOVE but the upper layer doesn't 
even use it :-( If you look at vgacon and friends you will see they 
recreate the cursor every time the cursor blinks. Yes even vgacon.c does 
this. It is stupid and brain dead but that is the way the upper layers of 
the console work. The correct solution would be to use actually use 
CM_MOVE in the upper layers.

We do if we make a ioctl for cursors. I'm trying to avoid reprogramming 
the hardware over and over again if the properties of the cursor don't 
change. The idea is similar to passing in var and comparing it to the var 
in struct fb_info.

Okay.

Strange. It should work. I reworked the logo code anyways. I did this 
because if we have more than one framebuffer in the system, say vesafb and 
vga16fb. We need to select the 16 color logo and a 224 color logo. The 
right logo needs to be draw on the right screen.
