The closest that I find in a quick scan is:
ANSI/ISO/IEC 9899-1999, page 126, section 6.7.8, constraint 14:
An array of character type may be initialized by a character string
literal, optionally enclosed in braces. Successive characters of the
character string literal (including the terminating null character if
there is room or if the array is of unknown size) initialize the
elements of the array.
