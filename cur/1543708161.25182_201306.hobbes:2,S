push+ret is encouraged/borrowed/stolen from FreeBSD ;) it should be 
reliable. And also, old linux uses ret. Since old linux runs on 386, it 
is quite reliable. If you still doubt, we can push before PG.
Hello Anvin,
Please either take the push+ret patch or take the one near jmp patch 
enclosed in this email. thanks
