Quite possible, perhaps worst-case cache state.

Quite possible, depending on what the raw distribution of times looks
like.  If there are a smallish number of 55us events (as there would
have to be given an average of 7us), the blue-moon scenario would lead
one to expect a much larger number of ~30us events (27.5us + 3.5us).
In absence of a ~30us bulge, there would still be the possibility that
one might see an even bluer (violet?) moon that might stack up to ~100us.
Heck, there might be that possibility anyway, but such is life when
measuring latencies.  :-/
(And, yes, there are other CDFs lacking a 30us bulge that would be
consistent with a 55us "blue-moon" bulge -- so I guess I am asking
if you have the CDF or the raw latency measurements -- though the
data set might be a bit large...  And I would have to think about
how one goes about deriving individual-latency CDF(s) given a single
dual-latency CDF, assuming that this is even possible...)

You are right that there might not be a correlation, and that it might
be OK to just divide the maximum latency by two, but I can imagine
cases where dividing by two was not appropriate.

Thanks for the info!
