I was worried more about forwarding path.

Oh, yeah that looked good - thats why i didnt comment. Your call.

I think its a little broken but not unlike say CISCOs multipath when
they have caching. 
The general trend though is that now multipathing is getting more
interesting and the policy criteria is no longer loadbalancing alone.
An example interesting paper and newer devices showing up: 
"Experiences in Building A Multihoming Load Balancing System" by
Fanglu Guo, Jiawu Chen , Wei Li, Tzi-Cker Chiueh (State University of
New York at Stony Brook

The idea proposed there is extensible to many other policy selections
(very easily implementable via tc actions).
cheers,
jamal
