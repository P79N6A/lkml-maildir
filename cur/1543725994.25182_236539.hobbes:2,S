Yeah, when the ksoftirqd is taking all the cpu it will be like that, but 
when the kernel is behaving normally the starving diff is between 0->1sec.
With two samba-server-> workstation -> nfs-server file copys on the diff 
is normally 0.02secs if I'm not doing anything else but If I will do 
something cpu-intensive like compiling the kernel with "make -j3", the 
ksoftirqd will be soon taking all the cpu-time but this requires that I 
will also have those network file transfers going on.
