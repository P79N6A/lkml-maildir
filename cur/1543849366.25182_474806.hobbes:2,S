What exactly does "available" mean in this context?  The console log I
posted earlier showed node 0 as having an active PFN range of 32768 -
278528 (245760 pages, or 960MB), and then showed a "freeing bootmem
node 0" message, *before* we hit the BUG.
If "available" doesn't mean "there are active pages which have been
given to the VM system via free_all_bootmem_node()", what does it
mean?
Paul.
