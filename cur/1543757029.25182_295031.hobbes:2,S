Subject: [BUG] 2.6.11-rc[234] setfont fails on i810 after resume from  ACPI-S3

HW info
Using vga=0xf07, default8x16 font, display has 30 lines
On powerup from S3 console has only 25 lines but still scrolls 
at 30 lines. Setfont historically fixes it. 
Tested with 2.6.10, 2.6.11-rc1: OK
Tested with 2.6.11-rc2-Vanilla and 2.6.11-rc[234]+swsusp2.
When using setfont, screen goes blank. Power up after S3
returns console in 25 lines mode with 30 lines scroll. 
Several attempts - same result.
Another bug I see only on this HW and only with 2.6 is that
when - and only when - using gentoo emerge --usepackage in
text console, scroll area resets to _25_ when portage 
"dumps" the (binary) package contents which scrolls pretty
fast. I was unable to reproduce this in any other way. 
Tried also echo loop in bash but perhaps it is too slow
or not random enough. Note that 2.4.2[789] no problem.

Michael
