And I have each time pointed out it is wrong over time because
a) "Geode" (Geode GX) runs -m486 code faster than -m586
b) "Geode" as a name also includes AMD Athlon "Geode NX" processors
c) Geode GX does not need OOSTORE because the processor manages DMA
snooping in hardware.
Linus please drop this patch.
