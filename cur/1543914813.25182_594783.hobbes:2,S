It looks like both of Pete's guesses were correct.  The highly-edited 
extracts below show a few things.
In 2.6.22, a disconnect occurred because ohci-hcd was loaded before 
ehci-hcd:

In 2.6.23, a different series of errors occurred because ohci-hcd, 
ehci-hcd, and uhci-hcd were loaded in parallel.

None of the nasty-sounding messages indicate any real problem.  They
are normal when a low- or full-speed device is connected while the
companion high-speed controller is initialized.
To prevent all the error messages, make sure the ehci-hcd is loaded
before the other two and after all the PCI devices have been detected.  
(In the presence of the hotplug subsystem, this may not be easy to
accomplish.)
At any rate, this is not a regression because it isn't a bug or a 
mulfunction.  It is normal behavior.
