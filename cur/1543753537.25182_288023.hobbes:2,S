What I am saying is what I said, no reinterpretation needed. Linus has 
not had the experience of being an administrator working where policies 
and resources are controlled by someone else. I think experience is 
valuable.

And people who haven't been there would not appreciate the reality if I

Again it means what it says, security services are cost effective. They 
control the resources used in providing security, because in some 
companies there simply aren't the human resources available to do a good 
job.

And that is a reasonable summary of the goals.

I actually like newsletter and Email alerts, they can be set to generate 
interrupts at the level appropriate, from "you have mail" to pager 
alerts, as desired.

I don't regard any solution less that perfect as "nobody can help." 
Timely fixes significantly reduce the exposure, the world isn't perfect.
