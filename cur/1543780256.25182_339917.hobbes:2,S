Subject: EXPORT_SYMBOL generates "is deprecated" noise

I'm getting lots of errors like this nowadays:
drivers/serial/8250.c:2651: warning: `register_serial' is deprecated 
(declared at drivers/serial/8250.c:2607)
Which is just: "EXPORT_SYMBOL(register_serial);"
Sorry, but that's just compile-time noise, not anything useful.
Warning on real usages of it might be handy (we can go fix the users)
but not EXPORT_SYMBOL - we can't kill the export until the function
goes away. The more noise we have, the harder it is to see real errors 
and warnings.
I took a quick poke around, but can't see what generates this stuff.
What is doing these checks, and can we please make an exception for
EXPORT_SYMBOL (and EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL) somehow?
M.
