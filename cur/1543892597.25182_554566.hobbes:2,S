Cool.  I notice you removed my UML hacks... Why?
I just don't get one thing.  This is almost a duplicate of
cramfs-block.  Why would we prefer a fork with a lot of code
duplication to adding a couple alternate code paths in cramfs-block?
Also keep in mind there are several reasons why you might want to have
block access to to a XIP built cramfs image.  I am unpersuaded that
this fork approach is fundamentally better.
