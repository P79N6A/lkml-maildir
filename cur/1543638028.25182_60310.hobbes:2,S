First, great job on the explanation, it went right in my folder for "when
the docs are clear" explanations.
Now a request, if someone is running a database app and tests this I'd
love to see the results. I expect things like LMbench to show more threads
ending at the same time, but will it help a reall app?
I bet it was tested briefly on IDE, my last use of IDE a week or so ago
lasted until I did "make dep" and the output went all over every attached
drive :-( Still, nice to know it will work if IDE makes it into 2.5.
