Wow. You've got some bad memory, and some bad prejudice. Fact is, I've
heard many Subversion core developers say, and I quote, "If BK were
open-sourced, we'd just pack up and go home". Fact is, Subversion is not
geared to replace BK, nor has the Subversion team ever claimed it as
such. Fact is, the website clearly states it is a CVS replacement, which
is not on par with what BK does else BK would never have come into
existence.
Sure, let's dig up the old ARM thread we had almost a year ago in
private email and use it to fuel flames in a legitimate thread. Of
course I thought you were about business, yet suddenly this has turned
personal. Let's also not forget some of the helpful emails I've sent you
in private.
You've clearly made your point. I'll delete my copy of BK since I have
no legal license to use it. That's all I wanted to know.
