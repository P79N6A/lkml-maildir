The Coverity checker found the following bug in the function 
gunze_process_packet in drivers/input/touchscreen/gunze.c:
<--  snip  -->
...
#define GUNZE_MAX_LENGTH        10
...
struct gunze {
...
        unsigned char data[GUNZE_MAX_LENGTH];
...
};
...
static void gunze_process_packet(struct gunze* gunze, struct pt_regs *regs)
...
                gunze->data[10] = 0;
...
<--  snip  -->
The bug is obvious, but for a correct solution someone should know this 
code better than I do.
