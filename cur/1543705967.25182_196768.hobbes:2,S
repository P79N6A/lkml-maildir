It gets worse. From the same draft (perhaps someone who has the final
version could comment ?), in the rationale for read():

But then

Now, what exactly does "intended" mean ?
Of course, in this part, they only talk about data staying together,
not whether it can get duplicated, or effects on f_pos.
