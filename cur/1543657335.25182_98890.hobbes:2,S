I'll have a look in there. I'm on 2.4.20 with acpi and preempt patches
applied in that order. In addition I'm using pcmcia-cs and not the
built-in stuff. I'm fixing that on another machine here now so that I
can try it out, but it seems to give me no grief and no worries or
errors starting it up and plugging the card in, and PnP finds
resources nicely and I get a nice double beep to indicate all went
well, assigning IPs and everything looks sane.
I'll try later tonight to go for the newer stuff.

WIll do.

I'm on gentoo :)

I'm trying to solve a 2 meter stretch here, but I also want to get
ready as I always seem to bump into an airport or hotell with WLAN,
and end up having to use it from Windows. And that's boring. :)
