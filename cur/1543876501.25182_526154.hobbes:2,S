Yes.  I was more concerned about "op" clashing with variables used
within the macro, but that's not an issue now.

I think it has to be there, though perhaps the "memory" is sufficient to
make sure all the calls get generated.  We don't want gcc to eliminate

gcc people would prefer it to be there explicitly, even though its
currently implied.
