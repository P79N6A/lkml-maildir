More specifically than what Jeff said:
	# Kernel build
	make -j 8 MAKE="make -j 8"
	# Thrash the VM system, using lmdd (part of lmbench)
	# This allocates a 256m buffer, bzeros it, then writes a pattern in
	# it 10 times.  If you have 512M of memory, use 512M.
	lmdd opat=1 bs=256m count=10
	# Thrash the network
	lmbench/bin/i686-linux/bw_tcp -s
	lmbench/bin/i686-linux/lat_tcp -s
	# This won't work but you get the idea;  I use xfanout for this.
	for i in a b c d e f
	do	rsh $i lmbench/bin/i686-linux/lat_tcp -s `hostname` &
		rsh $i lmbench/bin/i686-linux/bw_tcp -s `hostname` &
	done; wait
There's more, but a system which can do all of that well is not one which 
sucks :-)
