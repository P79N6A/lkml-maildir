Sure.  But what I was referring to was the recommendation that submitters
explicitly _remove_ lkml from the cc.

I am subscribed to a large number of lists, but I don't read them.  I keep
them around so I can go find and reply to the original email thread when a
fishy patch turns up in the tree.
But I'm not just talking about me.  Consider the example of a random lkml
lurker who has a PCF8575 and who can end up using an old version of the
code.

It goes like this:
- patch floats past, I save it
- a week or three later I check to see if it is still unmerged
- if so, go look at the lkml thread
- if nothing much has happened then I'll assume that it got lost and will
  pick it up so that it gets consideration
If the discussion got steered to a different list and lkml got removed from
that discussion then I end up wasting everyone's time.
