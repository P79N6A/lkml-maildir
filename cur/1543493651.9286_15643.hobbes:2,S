	Oh, I see. The problem being not that we can get the buffer on the
wrong list but that we can wander into the wrong list ourselves...
Ho-hummm... Methink your solution is wrong, though. Better one:
	do non-blocking scan of the lists, gathering the stuff that
should die into the separate (local) list.
	while the list is non-empty
		pick the first buffer,
		wait_on_buffer
		move it to free list.
Comments? I'm more worried about the loop device handling...
