Thanks. This fixed it.
However, i still have problems with my ISA busmaster DMA token ring card
in the box.
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/linux/linux-kernel/2002-10/0179.html
 still
applies to 2.5.39. After changing ISA_DMA_MASK, my Alpha is now running
2.5.39 :-)
Remaining issues:
- ATY frame buffer not working (black screen with jumpy cursor)
- ALSA doesn't compile (this seems to be cause by missing include here and
  there)
Cheers,
