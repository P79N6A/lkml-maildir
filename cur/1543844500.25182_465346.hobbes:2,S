Huh - time for me to play the dummy again ...
My (fog shrouded) vision of the future has:
 1) mempolicy - provides fine grained memory placement for task on self
 2) cpuset - provides system wide cpu and memory placement for unrelated tasks
 3) some form of resource groups - measures and limits proportion of various
    resources used, including cpu cycles, memory pages and network bandwidth,
    by collections of tasks.k
Both (2) and (3) need to group tasks in flexible ways distinct from the
existing task groupings supported by the kernel.
I thought that Paul M suggested (2) and (3) use common underlying
grouping or 'bucket' technology - the infrastructure that separates
tasks into buckets and can be used to associate various resource
metrics and limits with each bucket.
I can't quite figure out whether you have in mind above:
 * a conflict between two competing memory controllers for (3),
 * or a conflict between cpusets and one memory controller for (3).
And either way, I don't see what that has to do with the underling
bucket technology - how we group tasks generically.
Guess I am missing something ...
