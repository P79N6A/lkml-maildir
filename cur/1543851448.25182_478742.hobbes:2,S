Hello, all
I am optimizing a compiler and I believe there is a bug in such
compile. Currently, I have a test case, which is a scientific
application, has a lot of system time. This is weird, because this
case does not have many system calls. Meanwhile, compiled at another
option, I found all the "system time" are gone! So, I assume there is
some problem in the first one (though both binary produce correct
result). I used some performance tuning tool and found the hottest
address for CPU privilege level change event is: 0xa000000100001a70.
This address is not in code or data segment. Now, I am kinda stuck
here. My question is: how to find what this address is? Or find out
what is the cause of the "system time"? Thanks in advance.
PS: the platform is Itanium 2.
