The X test under simulated "Compile" load looks most interesting.
Most of the schedulers do quite poorly on this test - only Zaphod with
default max_ia_bonus and max_tpt_bonus manages to deliver under 100ms
max latency.  As expected with interactivity bonus disabled it performs
horribly.
I'd like to see some results with X reniced to -10.  Despite what the
2.6 release notes say, this still seems to make a difference.
