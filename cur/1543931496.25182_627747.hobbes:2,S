The 'budget' line would stay where it is. IMHO, it's only about this
list_move_tail(). (Probably also doing netpoll_poll_unlock()
during n->poll() could be considered to let the driver even destroy
napi just after napi_complete() - but it's another subject.)

Of course, with some care and explanations to driver maintainers, like in
this case, this all should probably work like it is. But IMHO it would be
easier to remember and maintain if there are some simple rules with no
exceptions, so here e.g. driver always "owns" (with functions like
napi_schedule(), napi_complete(), and maybe napi_move_tail()), and
net_rx_action() only reads the list and runs these functions?!
I see in a nearby thread you would prefer to save some work to drivers
(like this netif_running() check), but I think this all is at the cost
of flexibility, and there will probably appear new problems, when a
driver simply can't wait till the next poll (which btw. looks strange
with all these hotplugging, usb and powersaving).
