To follow up on this on the list, the culprit appears to be the attached
string.h update introduced between -rc3 and -rc4. Backing it out makes
the kernel work, making it clobber memory (as suggested by Linus) makes
it work as well.
The failed test was in mpparse.c, it didn't recognise the pci bus.
