I use LILO and I pass a devfs name for the ROOT fs. You just need to
pass the name as a string. If you type it at the LILO prompt, it gets
passed as a string (and thus devfs will use it to descend the tree).
Also, you can put in /etc/lilo.conf:
	append = "root=/dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part2"
and it will pass the string. Works nicely.
