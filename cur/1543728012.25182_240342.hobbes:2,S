Why?  This should be "auto-tuning".  We don't want to provide
yet-another-knob-for-people-to-tweak-from-userspace, right?

Ugh, that's just not a good thing at all.  You can do that by running:
	echo /bin/true > /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug
today if you have to.  I don't like the ability to stop the kernel from
running properly, like this patch allows you to.
