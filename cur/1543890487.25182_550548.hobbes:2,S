I think you are right.
But please note that cancel_freezing(p) is special. It is also called when
try_to_freeze_tasks() fails. So it should clear TIF_SIGPENDING if "p" is a
kernel thread, otherwise p may run with signal_pending() forever.
Unfortunately, it is not easy to detect the kernel thread, is_user_space()
is not reliable. Probably we should ignore this minor problem and do not
change cancel_freezing().
Oleg.
