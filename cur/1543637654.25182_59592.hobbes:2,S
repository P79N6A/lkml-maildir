I tracked down the problem. Originally the code initialized the VT tty
early before kmalloc. So we had this:
console_driver.flags |= TTY_DRIVER_NO_DEVFS;
Now in tty_register_driver, which was called right afterwards, we have
this bit of code.
if ( !(driver->flags & TTY_DRIVER_NO_DEVFS) ) {
                for(i = 0; i < driver->num; i++)
                    tty_register_devfs(driver, 0, driver->minor_start + i);
}
In the old code code the above was never called. Instead the code in
con_init_devfs was called.
Now in the new code we don't have TTY_DRIVER_NO_DEVFS set so the above is
called. The problem is the default flag that is passed into
tty_register_devfs. It is automatically 0 whereas before it was
DEVFS_FL_AOPEN_NOTIFY. The problem is the flag being passed.
I tried out devfs and found the problem is only root is now only allowed
to access vc/X. This is the problem. I haven't figured out a solution yet.
Any ideas anyone?
