This will be fixed in 2.6.27.8, so it should go away soon.

Does anyone have a link to the virtualbox linux kernel drivers?  I can't
seem to find them poking around on their site.  All I found were some
strange C++ files that couldn't possibly be the kernel code...

Should be resolved in 2.6.27.7, interesting that no one reported it in
.6, perhaps no distro did a release with that kernel version.
