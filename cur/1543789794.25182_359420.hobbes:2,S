arghhh. Right you are. I even had the proper solution coded up initially 
(i had || defined(CONFIG_PREEMPT)) but dropped it due to fatal brain 
error. Been hacking on way too much ktimer code today ... Hopefully 
better patch attached. Booted on SMP+PREEMPT x86. But i'd really advise 
you against taking patches from me tonight :-|
