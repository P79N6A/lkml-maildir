It wont work reliably in 2.2.15 even then as it misses some wake up calls

The kernel API is fairly constant for 2.2 (we'd like it to be 100% constant
but occasionally the brown stuff hits the fan in ways you cant keep it so)
The binary interface is not constant, will not be constant and we see it as a 
good thing. 
Take it up with Lucent
