Of course,it's impossible to test all the things/scenarios. Just, that 
kind of tool, should allow us to minimize the issues that we will face.

My idea is also hunting the bugs more easily via a tool like this that 
has a console/X interface and ability to bisect. So; users,who has 
little or no knowledge about git/bisect, can easily try to find out the 
problematic commits/bugs.
