First, run tulip with debug 2.  If it is a module, insmod tulip debug=2.
If builtin, compile with -DTULIP_DEBUG=2.
When it hangs, what does the tulip-diag program report?  Run as
tulip-diag -fame -p 0xb800.

Instead of ifconfig down/up, does
  ifconfig eth0 promisc
  ifconfig eth0 -promisc
fix the problem?  If so, I probably have a fix for you.
