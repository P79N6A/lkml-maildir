I don't see how that'll work ... we already have it defaulting to y,
but there's a previous setting that's 'n' from the 2.4 config file
they're upgrading from ... and that overrides the default, right?
I think in general, that's the right behaviour (else you'd override
your previous settings every time). It's just that in this case, it
creates a serious user problem that we really need to fix. Personally,
I'd be happy to just force it to on all the time, but I suspect that'd
get me lynched ;-)
