This (v4l-cx88-update.patch) can go to 2.6.13 whenever you are ready.

This (v4l-cx88-hue-offset-fix.patch) should be merged into 2.6.13 
immediately -- It is a one-line fix that corrects a bug that causes 
incorrect hue settings behavior in all cx88 chips.  It is also in Chris 
Wright's stable patch queue.

This (v4l-lgdt3302-read-status-fix.patch) is actually a dvb patch.  
There are two v4l boards that use the lgdt3302 dvb frontend, and these 
are the only known (supported) boards to use lgdt3302 at this time.  
This patch should go to 2.6.13 whenever 
(dvb-frontend-add-driver-for-lgdt3302.patch) does, as it corrects a 
major bug.
Come to think of it, dvb-frontend-add-driver-for-lgdt3302.patch is 
pretty much useless without the following patches:
v4l-add-dvb-support-for-dvico-fusionhdtv3-gold-q.patch
v4l-add-dvb-support-for-dvico-fusionhdtv3-gold-t.patch
v4l-lgdt3302-read-status-fix.patch
...so whenever the lgdt3302 stuff is going into 2.6.13, all four of these patches should go together.
Thank you!
