Why is it ugly? IMHO it is very much needed, as it would provide a 
mechanism for the kernel to be able to properly restore the screen if a 
user land program goes astray.

More tricks like what? All we need is the ability to call the BIOS and 
have it execute the necessary real mode code, just like we do on ia32 
machines in user land.

Yes, I am aware of the x86 emulator - I revived the project a few years 
back and Egbert Eich integrated it into XFree86 ;-)
