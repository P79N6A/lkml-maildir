You misunderstood my question.
I want to know what address was being accessed to cause the fault, not
the address of the faulting instruction.  The information I am looking
for does not exist in the struct sigcontext, but it does exist in the
siginfo_t.  See the man page for sigaction(2), particularly the
description of the si_addr field.  Then examine the handling of the
si_addr field in the kernel sources under arch/m68k and compare with
arch/i386.
Unless this information is just not available on the i386 architecture
(I do not know enough about it to be sure), I think this is a bug in
the kernel.
