Why is it that all IRQs get their name from the
IOAPIC pin number, but the timer connected to
pin 2 is called IRQ0 instead of IRQ2?
Are there other exceptions to this rule,
or is all the code for re-naming IRQs & pins
effectively just for the timer?
I wonder if we should't be moving to at least a build option which
deletes support for multiple pins at an IRQ, and deletes
suport for non-identity pin->IRQ mapping.

While the ACPI table parsing is very early, the _PRT parsing
can happen only after the ACPI interpreter is up, because
the _PRT's are encoded in AML.
