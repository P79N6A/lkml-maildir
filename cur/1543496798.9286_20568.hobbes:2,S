   [Assumption: we are talking about United States law]
   There are (at least) three things it appears your attorneys have overlooked.
This topic belongs elsewhere, so I won't prolong it here.  Please take
it elsewhere.  I will say, though, that given the classes which I've
taken concerning IP law, I believe Jeff Markey to be more correct than
you are on this score.  Some of the FSF's claims about how Copyright law
works are pretty wild, and have never been tested in court.  Indeed, at
least one law professor has said that some of their positions would be
laughed out of court.  But of course, we'll never know for sure until
it's settled in court, and since nearly all of us are not lawyers, none
of this should be considered legal advice.
I do know one thing, though.  We won't settle it by flaming at great
length on the linux-kernel list.  :-)
