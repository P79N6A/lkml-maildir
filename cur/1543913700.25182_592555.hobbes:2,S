Using that argument, there's an equal case for always requiring SCSI to
be built for every kernel, since very few people can boot a system
without a disk.  However, the 1% case is the embedded flash booting
community plus a few others, so we allow SCSI to be optional for our 1%
who don't want it.
At base, the Kconfig system is designed to give the greatest flexibility
with the fewest foot shooting opportunities.  However, we do tend to err
on the side of flexibility if there's a conflict between the two design
goals.

The process of becoming an expert in the kernel build system naturally
involves making mistakes and learning from them, so this is probably
time reasonably well spent.
