That's certainly another possibility, putting under question why for
certain architectures sys_ioctl gets exported (by inspection I can see a
valid reason only for sparc64).
Anyway, I don't have a list of drivers ready, I just ran into the issue
because a driver I had to port over from 2.4 worked on all intended
architectures but ia64, and I initially intended to go the route you
point out until I found that most 64-bit architectures with 32-bit
emulation layers actually export the symbol for appearantly this very
purpose.

Should ioctl32 handlers in drivers really call sys_ioctl?  Calling
sys_ioctl
makes sense for ioctls that are supported by a broad range of drivers,
but
in that case the ioctl32 translation should be in the core compat
code.
Drivers using register_ioctl32_conversion should rather call their own
ioctl handlers directly if you ask me.
Do you have a list of drivers currently needing sys_ioctl?
