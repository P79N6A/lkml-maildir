I don't see how can preempt-RT ever become hard-RT when a simple lock
hangs it. As soon as you call kernel code, you'll eventually hang,
kmalloc will have to allocate memory and pageout other stuff no matter
what.
I really hope embedded developers knows better and they don't get the
idea of using preempt-RT where hard-RT is required.
