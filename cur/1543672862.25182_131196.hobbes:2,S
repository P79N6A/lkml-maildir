JFFS2 suffers similarly from the VFS simultaneously calling read_inode()
and clear_inode() for the same inode, since it uses iget() internally
for garbage collection. Since deletion is a slow operation which
involves marking nodes obsolete on the medium, it's nice and easy to hit
the race and have jffs2_read_inode() start walking the list of nodes
belonging to a certain inode at the same time as jffs2_clear_inode() is
walking the same list freeing them all :)
I've added locking to prevent this from happening in that particular
case, by suspending garbage collection during jffs2_clear_inode(), but
that's undesirable and anyway, the problem still exists when a JFFS2
file system is exported by nfsd, if nfsd attempts to open the inode
while it's being deleted.
Your patch should solve that too -- looks sane to me.
