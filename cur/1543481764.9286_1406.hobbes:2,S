Actually, it's probably a personality quirk in the web server running that
site.  It's seeing the ".gz" filename extension and, rather than sending
the file with a "Content-Type: application/gzip" or "Content-Type:
application/octet-stream", it sends it with a "Content-Encoding: gzip" and
some other content-type (text, maybe?).  A prefereable behavior (in my
estimation) would be for the client to ask for "patch-X.X.X" and be sent
the contents of "patch-X-X-X.gz" with "Content-Encoding: gzip" set so that
the client would use the decoded filename rathern than the filename of the
pre-encoded entity.
I've been hacking HTTP servers for too long.
ANYWAY, on to the original question!
I think you can make those MS-Mangled(TM)(R)(C) patched files usable by
piping them through something like "sed s/\r\n/\n/g", right?
