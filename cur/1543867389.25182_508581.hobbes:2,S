Just doesn't seem logical to have CONFIG_SWAP ifdef cover the
whole thing, regardless that it produces the desired result.
I'm going to submit a fixup patch to Linus covering all this
stuff, after making a more comprehensive test case (yes I
actually did test this patch with a few different cases before
submitting it, so I must have been unlucky with uninitialised
data).
If he wants to apply it rather than back out the patch entirely,
its up to him.
I don't think there is any reason to panic. I did completely
forget the result vector, but AFAIKS that's the only real bug
in it.
