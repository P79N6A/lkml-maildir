Considering machines that run headless and keyboardless, there's no obvious
reason that the keyboard driver should not modularizable, except that nobody
cares enough to do it.
Even when you're using a local keyboard, it might be fun to be able to tweak
the driver and then reload it with "rmmod keyboard;insmod keyboard" instead
of a reboot.
