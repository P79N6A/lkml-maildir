A new release of the Via audio driver for Linux, version 1.1.2, is now
available at the driver's home page:
	
http://gtf.org/garzik/drivers/via82cxxx/
This driver includes the usual bug fixes and code cleanups.  New
features include AC97 mixer support, limited /proc output, and some
documentation.  The AC97 mixer is now preferred over the soundblaster
mixer (which has been reported to be non-functional in some cases).
NOTE:  The above Web site's DNS appears to be down at the moment.  It's
IP is 130.207.47.194.
A new mailing list has been formed for Linux users of Via motherboards. 
My audio driver will be supported through that list, but it is intended
to be a mutual support forum for all Via motherboard owners running
Linux, not just my driver.
To subscribe, see instructions on the web site above, or simply e-mail
