It's because we've seen it a hundred zillion times before...  weird problems
with overclocked systems that the owners claim "work fine under any other
version, so it must be a kernel bug".
You could well be on the edge of where overclocking breaks down.  There's
some sequence of instructions and/or memory access in the kernel that is
causing your particular CPU to croak every billionth time through.  Maybe
previous kernel compiles didn't emit those exact instructions and you
lucked out.
Anyway, turn off overclokcing and try to reproduce.
