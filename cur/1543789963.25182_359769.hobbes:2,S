Please contact Nicolas Pitre about that - that was my suggestion,
but ISTR apparantly the overhead is too high.

Now that I look at it, it's probably buggy - if the page isn't already
dirty, it will modify without the COW action.  Again, please contact
Nicolas about this.

Well, adjust_pte is extremely critical to ensure correct cache behaviour
(and therefore data integrity) so if split ptlock is incompatible with
this, split ptlock loses.
As far as adjust_pte being called, it's only called for VIVT caches,
which means the configuration has to do if VIVT, disable split ptlock.
