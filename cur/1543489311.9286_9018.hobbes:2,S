 Hi,
another mail about the NFS write performance problem.
Trond suggested to make sure that attribute caching is not turned off.
I though he was referring to a kernel option, but I read up on this
and he's most likely referring to a nfs mount option (noac).
The filesystem in question uses these mount options:
envy:/server/home/gback on /.a/envy/server/home/gback type nfs (rw,overlay,intr,bg,quotas,grpid,vers=3,proto=udp,dev=00000006)
cat /proc/mounts shows:
envy:/server/home/gback /.a/envy/server/home/gback nfs rw,rsize=1024,wsize=1024,acregmin=0,acregmax=0,acdirmin=0,acdirmax=0,addr=envy 0 0
So, you're right: I seem to have it turned off indeed.
Now how do I turn it on?  Or more importantly, who turned it off 
in the first place?
Note that I'm running amd using a NIS map.
Amd is run like this:
/usr/sbin/amd -a /.a -l syslog -c 1000 /home amd.home
The map has an opts entry like so:
opts:=rw,overlay,intr,bg,quotas,grpid,vers=3,proto=udp;type:=link
"man amd" didn't show me how to tell amd what mount options to use.
I guess I'll have to ask amd-dev.
Thanks,
	- Godmar
