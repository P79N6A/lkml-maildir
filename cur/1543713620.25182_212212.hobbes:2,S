That and a few others are in the pending queue which I'll push
when Linus gets back. See 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/bitkeeper/agpgart/
for the patch-of-the-day from bk://linux-dj.bkbits.net/agpgart
In particular theres an additional fix for SiS users, I broke
AGPv2 support in the previous fix that went into 2.6.5
