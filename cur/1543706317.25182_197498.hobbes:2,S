Well, I didn't see it again, and if for some reason, we still
enter the function with tty->driver_data == NULL (which may still
happen if the tty layer itself isn't serializing, which I suspect),
we will print a warning and bail out.
In the end, I suppose the warning can be removed, but I want to
make sure that if the race still happens, we behave properly now.
The patch makes sure the vt internal state stays consistent.
