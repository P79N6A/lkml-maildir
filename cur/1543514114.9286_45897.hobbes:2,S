  Hi, all. I've just released version 1.2.5 of my devfsd (devfs
daemon) at: 
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
This works with devfs-patch-v112 (or later) and devfs-patch-v99.4 (or
later).
The main changes are:
- Added compatibility actions
- Added compatibility entries for sound, printer, video4linux,
  parallel port and frame buffer drivers.
				Regards,
					Richard....
