No experience with this, but removing the semaphore protection in merge_segments
has side-effects in some other syscalls, especially sys_shm, sys_mlock,
sys_mprotect, sys_mremap, i.e.
No idea, of the actions taken in merge_segments has to be protected in these
syscalls. Or if all these syscalls should get the semaphore before calling
merge_segments or even bevor using functions like do_mmap, ...
What ever, it seems to be a rather big chance for a pre11.
