I don't follow --- we already have a refcount to the bh, how can it be
reused?  We took the j_list_lock first, then looked up the jh on this
transaction's sync data list, then did the get_bh() without dropping
j_list_lock; so by the time we take the refcount, the j_list_lock
ensures it cannot have come off this transaction.  And subsequently, the
refcount prevents reuse.
