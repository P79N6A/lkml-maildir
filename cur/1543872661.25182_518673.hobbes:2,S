That patch series was rather a mess
- Multiple patches with the same Subject: (I might have lost some as a result)
- Several patches which tried to remove the same header file
- Several patches which simply didn't apply
- Inconsisent changelogging, inconsistent titling
- Lack of sequence numbering (again, contributes to possible patch loss)
- Useless indenting in changleog text which I have to edit away.
We have good tools (ie: quilt) which make this sort of thing nice and easy
to get right - please use them.
I didn't check that these headers are indeed unused.  I hope you got that
minor part right..
