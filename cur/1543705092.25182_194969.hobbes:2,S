Has this been demonstrated on *any* system/arch using GCC 3.2.3 (or other
3.2 series) or is it limited in scope to the description below?  Does it
seem to do this with other implementations (other than sha256.c) or other
kernels?  Just trying to get an idea if this is a complier optimization bug
or something much more limited in scope.
My personal lab is currently being unboxed and I won't be able to run my own
tests for another week or so.  (apologies in advance)
In any case, this is *extremely* serious from a number of angles.
Kind Regards,
-dsp

Have you noticed if this happens for any of the other crypto algorithms?
