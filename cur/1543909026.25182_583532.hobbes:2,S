Not at all.

Easy, use the BIO_POOL bits to know the bi_max_size, the same as for a 
bio from the standard pool.  Just put the power of two size in the bits 
and map that number to the standard pool arrangement with a table 
lookup.

It is a system wide problem.  Every block device needs throttling, 
otherwise queues expand without limit.  Currently, block devices that 
use the standard request library get a slipshod form of throttling for 
free in the form of limiting in-flight request structs.  Because the 
amount of IO carried by a single request can vary by two orders of 
magnitude, the system behavior of this approach is far from 
predictable.

OK, we got one and another is close to cracking, enough of that.

Whoever stated that was wrong, but this should be no surprise.  There 
have been many wrong things said about this particular bug over the 
years.  The one thing that remains constant is, Linux continues to 
deadlock under a variety of loads both with and without network 
involvement, making it effectively useless as a storage platform.
These deadlocks are first and foremost, block layer deficiencies.  Even 
the network becomes part of the problem only because it lies in the 
block IO path.
