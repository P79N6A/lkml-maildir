well, yes, that would certainly do it, but i'm not that ambitious.
:-)  actually, what i'm testing now is deleting the two superfluous
includes from <linux/percpu.h>:
  #include <linus/slab.h>
  #include <linux/string.h>
doing "make allyesconfig" on x86, watching where the compile fails,
fixing that file, and noticing that errors fall into a fairly small
set of localized clumps, so i'll just collect them and submit them.
there's actually not that many.  patches to follow shortly.
