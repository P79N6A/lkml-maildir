Dear all,
When I use 2.4.7-10 i686 kernel from stock Redhat 7.2 as the NFS server. 
My NFS client use the 2.4.13 kernel, when I mount the nfsroot to the 
server, I found it is dead slow on the client. This only happens in i686 
kernel on the server, if we use a K6-2 uses an i386 server its fine. 
What's going on? By the way, how to configure the client to default use 
a NFSv3 mount? Thanks.
regards,
David
