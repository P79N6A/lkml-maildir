Looks great... however I notice a few obvious false positives in the
example log:
 > Don't init statics to 0/NULL:

ummm?
 > 137054:+static uint32_t drvr_ver  = 0x02200207;
that ain't zero...
 > 230079:+                path->static_rate = 0;
and that ain't a static variable.
I guess trying to parse C in a regexp is a little tricky.
Also, it would be nice to be able to do something like
    git diff v2.6.20..|perl ~/checkpatch.pl -
rather than having to create a temp file -- as it stands that command
produces
    unknown option: -
    usage: findbugs.pl [-options] file(s)
      -allsource : check entire source file, not just '+' patch lines
      -pedantic : TBD
      -style : TBD
      -v, --verbose : verbose
      -h, --help : this help text
    Version: 002
And even worse
    git diff v2.6.20..|perl ~/checkpatch.pl
just silently does nothing (maybe a "no input files" warning would be
a good clue for people).
