kexec at least at the end, and probably for earlier for handling
panics wants code to be in a very specific location in ram. 
If you want to hook the functionality behind in behind kexec_load,
when say KEXEC_FIXED is passed as a flag, go ahead.  There is enough
other setup to jump to the code loaded into memory that "load a blob
of data into physical memory and keep it there" is not a sufficient
interface.
In the general case I using some kind of scatter gather list seems
the most polite way to go.
