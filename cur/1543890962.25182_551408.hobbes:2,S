Yes, the larger number of schedulable entities and hence slower
convergence to groupwise weightings is a disadvantage of the flattening.
A hybrid scheme seems reasonable enough. Ideally one would chop the
hierarchy in pieces so that n levels of hierarchy become k levels of n/k
weight-flattened hierarchies for this sort of attack to be most effective
(at least assuming similar branching factors at all levels of hierarchy
and sufficient depth to the hierarchy to make it meaningful) but this is
awkward to do. Peeling off the outermost container or whichever level is
deemed most important in terms of accuracy of aggregate enforcement as
a hierarchical scheduler is a practical compromise.
Hybrid schemes will still incur the difficulties of hierarchical
scheduling, but they're by no means insurmountable. Sadly, only
complete flattening yields the simplifications that make task group
weighting enforcement orthogonal to load balancing and the like. The
scheme I described for global nice number behavior is also not readily
adaptable to hybrid schemes.
