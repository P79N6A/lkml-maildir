Thank you.  Quad 700 meg Xeons?  Nice machine, that.
The NMI oops changes are working well. We can see three CPUs are
stuck in different places spinning on the same lock with interrupts
disabled, but unfortunately something went wrong with your `ksymoops'
run.
Could you please rerun ksymoops, and make sure that you use the
correct symbol file?  Take the `System.map' from the directory
where you built the kernel and run
	ksymoops -m System.map < log_file
