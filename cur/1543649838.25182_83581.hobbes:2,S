If you don't control the network between the Accelerator and your
webserver, you're toast anyway.

So what? How many "secure ecommerce sites" just put the information that
you sent over the secure channel into a database accessible by a tcp
port? or simply print it out? Send it via unencrypted mail to their
sales department (presumable to foobar-marketing@aol.com. Yes, I've
already seen that.). HTTPS is just a gurantee, that your data isn't
sniffed between your web browser and the device you're talking to. Once
the data hits the web server, there is nothing that HTTPS can do or you
can rely on.

Of course. Once you hit more than a few https transfers, you can either
burn your cpu cycles for doing crypto or simply use a device.
