Using your argument... Everytime my feline decides to chew my ethernet
cable i lose my network connection, hence i get ICMP HOST UNREACHABLE ergo

Those are errors just filtering up the layers, same way an app doesn't
know anything about what device you're writing to, but will complain about
incomplete data writes if you run out of space.
