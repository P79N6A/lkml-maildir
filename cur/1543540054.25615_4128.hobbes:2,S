   Yes.  That won't delete a *directory*.
If someone puts a directory there, deleting it via "rm -rf" is probably
the wrong thing.  They're stupid, but they don't deserve to be punished
that badly.  :-)
I'm not convinced the test -e test is worth it; creating a symlink in
the directory if the directory is there isn't going to be the end of the
world.  I suppose the next time we do the build the make install will
blow out, but that can be easily fixed by making the ln command use 
"ln -sf".    We're arguing over niggling details, though....
If Linus wants to make the ln command use "ln -sf", that's great.    If
not, it's not the end of the world...
