git@vger sometimes bounces, so let's leave lkml as backup.

Sure, the problem with GIT is that it stores the sources inside a backend 
container that is only accessible via GIT; iow, you can't retrieve your 
sources directly / transparently.
One way to achieve transparency could be to allow mounting GIT on a dir-mount 
point.  And just use that dir normally, while GIT manages all the rest in 
the background.
Thanks!
