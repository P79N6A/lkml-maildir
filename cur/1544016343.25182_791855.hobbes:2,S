Is it a regression (I guess no) from any older version?

Please run alsa-info.sh with --no-upload option with several mixer
states (e.g. internal mic switch on/off) and attach the generated
files.
"Mic Playback Switch" doesn't control the internal mic.  It's only for
the mic jack.  You should be able to mute "Internal Mic Playback
Switch", and this should be irrelevant from the capture path.
Make sure that your mixer app does anything strange...
thanks,
