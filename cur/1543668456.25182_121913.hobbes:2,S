Actually, do they do disable preemption - if they do not, something is
broken.
Because, even on UP, preemption can lead to a race over a variable that
has no locking because its per-CPU.  But it would need locking
otherwise, and thus we do need to disable preemption.  I.e., per-CPU
vars are only safe on SMP because we assume the other processors won't
touch them.  If we start preempting, even on UP, we have problems.
So something else is amiss here...
