The change was NOT arbitrary. It was deliberate and for the reasons
stated.
The whole point of leases is to support CIFS oplocks for Samba and NFSv4
delegations in the kernel. Both have the same specific expected
behaviour.
The original deviates from that expected behaviour by allowing you to
get a shared lease when in a condition that does not allow actual
sharing.
