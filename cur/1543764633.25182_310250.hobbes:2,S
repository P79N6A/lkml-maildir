But how does that help me? I still want to be able to pass a list of
unwanted modules on the kernel command line. Using initramfs and
modules is fine, although I would prefer being able to unload built-in
modules instead - but that is another story. Your suggestion just
pushes the problem to user space. I think the best alternative would
be a combination of kernel-space code (my patch) and awareness of the
command line in the module loader running from initramfs/rootfs.
