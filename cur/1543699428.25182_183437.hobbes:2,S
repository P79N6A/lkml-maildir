Hi Dave, by "they cause trouble" I meant: they may take, or lead to
taking, dev->serialize.  This means that before my patch they could
lead to occasional deadlocks, and with my patch will always cause
deadlocks.

No.  usb_set_configuration takes dev->serialize, which is
already taken.  There is no other problem.

Yeah, these things are a mess.  My patch only fixes the
locking problems, not the fact that they never worked
anyway.  Even so, it may be hard to get it into 2.6.0.
