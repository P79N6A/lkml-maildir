 I have a optical mouse.How do i send command to light
up the optical mouse o
n and off.For keyboard i have command EB and other the
led control like scroll i
s 0 and other stuff using inb and outb.
                 How do i  send a signal to mouse.In
other OS like windows i can
 see the mouse turns its lights on and off while
booting.Is it a problem with li
nux.So what command should i send to turn up the
lights.
                 Also where can i find the code and
docs for it . 
3)Where can i find a ata harddisk and cdrom generic
driver.Can't we do it without DMA.I mean usual read
byte using inb (without dma registers )like scancode
from keyboard. Code and links would be helpful.
Thank you
