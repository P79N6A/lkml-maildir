Well the fact is that we have 3-4 distinct reports of this oops, and all
of them are using md. No reports have been filed where md isn't managing
the disks. While this doesn't conclusively put the finger of blame on
md, it is still likely. It could bug a CFQ bug too of course, or (more
likely), some bad interaction between md and CFQ.

Very much.

I had something similar for generic_unplug_request() as well, but didn't
see/hear any reports of it being tried out. Here's a complete debugging
patch for this and other potential dangers.
