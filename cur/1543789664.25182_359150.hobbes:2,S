I use only -mm, and skipped 2.6.13-mm3. 2.6.14-rc1-mm1 had some other
oops and I didn't even try ipw2200. So last OK was 2.6.13-mm2 (which
I'm still using now)

I meant that it oopsed just after I modprobed it. But as it makes a
iwlist just after having been loaded, I guess it is actually in an iwlist.
