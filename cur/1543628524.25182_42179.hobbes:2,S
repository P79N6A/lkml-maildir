While I haven't tested on an SMP system, the patch should at least be
SMP safe. As for preempt-safe, I noticed in Dieter's previous tests that
the free list had been sufficiently fragmented that there were no high-
order groups of pages left available. Could this cause a problem?
I can't track this list carefully enough to apply and test all the patches
mentioned.
