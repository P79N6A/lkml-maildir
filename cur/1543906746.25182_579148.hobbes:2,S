It only affects hot paths in the NUMA case so non-NUMA users will not care. For
NUMA users,  I have posted patches that eliminate multiple zonelists altogether
which will reduce cache footprint (something like 7K per node on x86_64)
and make things like MPOL_BIND behave in a consistent manner. That would
cost on CPU but save on cache which would (hopefully) result in a net gain
in most cases.
I would like to go with this patch for now just for policies but for 2.6.23,
we could leave it as "policies only apply to ZONE_MOVABLE when it is used" if
you really insisted on it. It's less than ideal though for sure.
