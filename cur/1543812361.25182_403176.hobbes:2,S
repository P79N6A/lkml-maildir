And it removes most of my interaction problem with multiple pid spaces.

I guess the worst case behavior would be triggered by a find in /proc.
Which would probably populate a ref for every pid, and it isn't that
uncommon.   So I suspect we really want to make ref_array be able to
use pid hashfn as it is likely to get an equal amount of use.
