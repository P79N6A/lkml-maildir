I just tried Andre's patch. I applied it on top of 2.4.19pre9-ac3.(Patch attached below.) It pulled me up to DMA. I tested by setting hdparm -d1 /dev/hdc
(my DVD drive) and played a DVD with Xine. It played great!
I do not have an IDE hard drive to test, since my HD is SCSI.
I will try Vojtech's patch next, and report in.
Thanks for all your help! (Andre, Vojtech, JeffN and everyone else.)
Tony
