platform_data should contain platform specific data which is relevant
to the device in question, and which the device driver may read in
order to adapt itself for driving the device on the platform.  eg,
configuration information.
driver_data is data which is owned by the driver, for use in driving
the device.  Eg, a pointer to the struct net_device structure for
network device drivers.

You should generally use the resources to pass address information.

That doesn't sound quite right, but it depends on what the platform
driver is doign.

Yes, provided that you only have one platform device which is never
removed independently of being a module or hotplug.

See above, but omit the "hotplug" case - having the platform device
in with the driver does mean that the only time _that_ device gets
unregistered is when you remove the module, in which case the __exit
code will be retained.  So the condition comes down to "only have
one platform device for this driver".

This depends on your point of view - whether you think there's a
possibility that the driver_data might be accessed somehow after
you've freed the pointer.  Having a NULL pointer will give you a
very deterministic failure.
Of course, it can also be viewed as needless code and therefore not
required.  Again, it's an opinion thing.

Looks fine, though see above comments concerning the platform data
vs the resources.
