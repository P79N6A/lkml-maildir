If you start playing with the swap code, could you please change the
on-disk swap struct definition to look like:
union swap_header {
	:
	:
	struct {
		char         bootbits[1024];    /* Space for disklabel etc. */
		unsigned __u32 version;
		unsigned __u32 last_page;
		unsigned __u32 nr_badpages;
		char           volume_label[16];
		unsigned __u32 padding[121];
		unsigned __u32 badpages[1]; 
	} info;
};
1) change all of the "int" definitions in info to be __u32, because this
   is written to disk and we want the sizes to be unambiguous
2) the volume label field has been previously discussed and doesn't
   impose any compatibility, but allows one to "swapon by label"
   (old patch URL at

)
Cheers, Andreas
