well, apart from glibc and gcc, gasm, cpp, ld and other compilation
tools there are also bash, shellutils, fileutils, findutils, textutils,
gnu m4, gnu make, gnu awk, and gnu sed that i can think of off the top
of my head.
these tools constitute the bulk of a basic unix system (a unix system
may have more tools than these, but they won't/shouldn't have any less),
and they're all FSF/GNU programs developed as part of the GNU system...
....and that's exactly stallman's point - the GNU system existed long
before the linux kernel did. When Linux came along, the only thing
missing from GNU was a free kernel. Linux filled that gap, resulting
instantly in a complete, free operating system.
GNU is the system, Linux is the kernel. GNU/Linux is the GNU system
running on a Linux kernel.
(similarly, GNU/Hurd will mean the GNU system running an a HURD kernel)
as for your comments about rms acting like a 'twit' or a 'two year old
child', i think you should look at your own behaviour and blinkered
comments on this issue before pointing the finger at anyone else.
