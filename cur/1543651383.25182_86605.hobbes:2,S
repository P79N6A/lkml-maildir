I haven't got a single system around here with SCSI hardware in it anymore, 
and the last time I dealt with fibrechannel was almost two years ago now.  I 
just tracked the patch for other people who would be interested.

P.S.  Personally, I think SCSI is kind of pointless these days.  I fit 20 IDE 
drives in a box once, configured as raid 5.  These days that would be over 3 
terabytes.  Yes, the cables were annoying.  And if you need more space than 
that just use a clustering filesystem over gigabit eithernet.  Or for that 
matter, 100baseT with gigabit uplinks on the switches is usually plenty.  
(The cost of gigabit has come down, but the switches are murder.  That's why 
bonding pairs of 100baseT cards isn't necessarily cost effective: the cards 
themselves are dirt cheap but switches with gigabit uplinks more than make up 
the difference, as we wait for 10gigE to bring the cost of normal 1gigE down 
to something reasonable...)
Then again I've always been trying to optimize the price to performance ratio 
more than anything else.  I'm a cheap bastard and proud of it...
