Don't know - I'd need to dive in and work that out, and it's probably
better than you do this..

Please, no.  That's a 4092-byte increase in sizeof(struct percpu_counter). 
Hence a 12 kbyte increase in sizeof(struct ext3_sb_info).  Let's just sort
out the cgroup startup ordering.
<looks at __percpu_alloc_mask>
<wanders off-topic>
Eric, is that optimal?  alloc_percpu() will pass down cpu_possible_map in
`mask', and we only need to allocate enough slots to cover the
highest-set-bit in cpu_possible_map.  However the implementation ignores
`mask' and does 
        size_t sz = roundup(nr_cpu_ids * sizeof(void *), cache_line_size());
        void *pdata = kzalloc(sz, gfp);
Now, if the highest-set-bit in cpu_possible_map is always equal to
(1<<nr_cpu_ids) then it doesn't matter.  But is that the case?
(If someone calls __percpu_alloc_mask with something that has less bits set
than cpu_possible_map then it surely is wasteful, but that sounds
unlikely).
