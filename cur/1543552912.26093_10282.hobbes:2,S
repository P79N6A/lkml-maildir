Yep, there's a solution for this. Get yourself the complete
specifications for the Win2K NTFS, and implement it. The kernel NTFS
simply doesn't support the Win2K NTFS, and rather than risking anything,
it just OOPS:es. Not that I have any Win2K systems, but if I had, I'd
damn sure rather see the kernel OOPS than those filesystems trashed.
