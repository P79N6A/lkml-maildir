Do you know if this device is actually constructed from a SCSI device
and an adapter ?  Many PP scanners use proprietary non-SCSI protocols.
If SANE supports the same scanner in a non-PP version, then you should
try to locate the windows driver for the PP-SCSI adapter.  If it is
one we are working on, you may be in luck fairly soon.
