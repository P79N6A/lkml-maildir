Subject: [PATCH] pmac_zilog: initialize port spinlock on all init paths
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Dear Ben,
This patch fixes the Zilog driver so it doesn't freak on my TiBook.
( of course, it still spews diahrea of 'IN from bad port XXXXXXXX'
  but then, I don't have the hardware.... still, seems weird that OF
  would report that I do have said hardware :-/ )
Please look it over and send it on.

pmac_zilog: initialize the serial ports' spinlocks even if console over 
   serial is not enabled; disable this driver by default for ppc
This lock not being initialized was Oopsing my TiBook :-P
