Just installed RH 6.0 (kernel 2.2.5-15) and have had an old problem come back.
I'm running virtual services, using the Virtual-Services HOW-TO as a guide.
When attempting to telnet to a virtual server, the session fails, with the
error "telnetd: All network ports in use."
On the old machine, (RH 5.1 upgraded to kernel 2.0.36), this was caused by
the /dev tree not being filled out correctly.
I have attempted to fill out the dev tree by the following methods, with no
improvement:
	cp -pdR /dev /virtualpath
	hard links
	symbolic links
	tar, copy, and un-tar
	install RH dev-???.rpm in virtual
Any protocol that tries to open a pty fails in the virtual tree, but works
fine in the main server. it's appearing that the pty is not being allowed
to operate either because of the chrooted environment or because of
disagreements with the virtuald code. The virtuald has ben re-compiled
(using gcc). If someone can  tell me how to compile virtuald.c in egcs,
I'll happily try that.
