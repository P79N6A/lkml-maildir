This is a SWAG ( Silly Wild Ass Guess ), but maybe tmpfs isn't mapping 
the files sequentially in ram, or is otherwise doing something to 
prevent proper swap clustering and read ahead?

You aren't supposed to be using tmpfs in this way at all ;)
tmpfs is meant to hold small files that will only exist for a short 
time, or do not need to persist after a reboot.  Keep your big data 
files on a normal filesystem, and let the kernel worry about caching the 
most frequently accessed parts.
