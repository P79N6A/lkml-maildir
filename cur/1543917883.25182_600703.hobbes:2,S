Subject: [PATCH] Fix timer_stats printout of events/sec

Hi,
When using /proc/timer_stats on ppc64 I noticed the events/sec field
wasnt accurate. Sometimes the integer part was incorrect due to rounding
(we werent taking the fractional seconds into consideration).
The fraction part is also wrong, we need to pad the printf statement and
take the bottom three digits of 1000 times the value.
