It's necessary because in C++, (void *)0 is not implicitly converted
to other pointer types.  Having to write static_cast<T*>(NULL) is
certainly a bit too verbose.
There's also a C++ DR about this topic because people feel that there
should be a 0/NULL distinction for overloading.  But this is
completely irrelevant to C code.
