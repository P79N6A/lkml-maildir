I posted that patch on Wednesday.  In case you missed it I include
it below.  Incidentally, I spotted this problem by using the -W flag.
It's a shame that some of the warnings this generates can't be worked
around; we can't make the header files clean.  (in particular, the test
against zero always being false is something we don't want warned about in
the signal.h file.  I tried a couple of things to eliminate that warning,
but I can't see a way.)
