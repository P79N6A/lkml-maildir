I checked on what pgcl was doing, and it's buggy. Thanks, I'll fix it
up and keep it rolling for when the time is right to send pieces in
(if ever for 2.6).

This is the easy part; we're basically just prefaulting.

This sounds more serious. My first thought is address-ordering the
locking, but it's not obvious how to do that with the current control
flow structure (and it sounds oversimplified). On my list of things to
think about.
