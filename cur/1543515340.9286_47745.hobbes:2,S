You're assuming that a devfs-system will still mount devpts on
/dev/pts, which is not necessarily the case (and is actually
undesirable). Devfs has a "live" implementation of /dev/pts. In fact,
devfs fully implemented a dynamic /dev/pts before devpts even existed.
So that's why glibc at least needs to check the magic number of /dev
and see if /dev/pts is a directory.
But I still favour the speculative open method (get a master, then try
and open the slave in /dev/pts, if it fails, set a flag). It's robust
and allows alternative implementations of /dev/pts (such as a daemon).
Why don't you implement it this way?
