These names are truncated - they should end with two hex digits:
	snprintf(device->bus_id, sizeof(device->bus_id), "%s:pcie%02x",
		 pci_name(parent), get_descriptor_id(port_type, service_type));
Names were truncated at 18 characters, but sizeof(device->bus_id) is 20
currently, so these names should just fit there.  I see that snprintf()
was changed recently - maybe there is some off-by-one bug there?
And if you want, you can blame me for such long names:

    [PATCH] PCIE: make bus_id for PCI Express devices unique
    The bus_id string must be unique for all devices of that bus in the
    system, not just for devices with the same parent - otherwise multiple
    symlinks with identical names appear in /sys/bus/pci_express/devices.
