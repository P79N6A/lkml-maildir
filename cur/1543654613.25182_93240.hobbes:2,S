hey
does /proc/cpuinfo refreshed something when the system is booted ?
I have here a laptop which should reduce it's clockspeed when the adapter
is removed, but when I look in /proc/cpuinfo it seems it's still running
at full speed.
when I boot linux with adapter disconnected, and then I check, it's ok.
but when I connect the adapter, again nothing changes ... (it stays at the
reduced speed)
thanks
	michael
