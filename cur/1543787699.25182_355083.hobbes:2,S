Nice. I also don't want to rule out anything before I really understand
what's going on.

Of course.

Yes, all the kernels that I use are just plain vanilla kernels taken
straight from kernel.org. No other patches applied.

Yes, I am.

I have noticed the problem mostly on disk. One strange situation was
when I was untarring a kernel tree (compressed with bzip2) and in the
middle of the extraction, bzip2 complained that the thing was
corrupted.
I removed what was extracted right away and tried again to extract the
tree (at this point, suspecting even that something in software had
problems). The problem with bzip2 occurred again. Then, I rebooted the
system an the problem magically went away.

I only have one filesystem right now, but given the difficulties that
I'm seeing, I do plan to go back to a multiple filesystem setup (which I
always used but thought that was overkill---nothing like time to teach
us something what is safest).
If you want to know anything else, don't hesistate to ask.
