Yes.  This patch (like most of the module stuff) was written long
before the mmuless archs were merged.  It didn't occur to me to look
through all the archs again.

You can now make kernel/extable.o depend on this configuration option
(whatever you decide it should be).
And surround kernel/module.c's search_module_extables with the same
option.
It's trivial, just CC: me when you send to Linus, and I'll re-xmit if
he drops it.

No, they're for copy_to/from_user and friends.  If your arch doesn't
rely on exception handling to trap wierd accesses, you can turn this
off.
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
