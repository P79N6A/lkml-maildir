This is not entirely correct. An alsa-lib compatible library can be 
implemented on top of OSS. It has already been done up to some degree for 
the audio and mixer parts (sequencer/MIDI support is under work just now).
I agree this is bit inpractical solution since ALSA has some 1500 library 
functions (and more to be added in the future). It is very difficult to 
test such library because just a limited subset of them has been used by 
any of the ALSA apps we were able to get working. In fact it looks like 
two ALSA apps (for similar purpose) may have been implemented using very 
different sets of ALSA functions (with relatively small overlap).

Or full ALSA library could be implemented on top of the OSS drivers. Or 
OSS can be modified to support ALSA's kernel level driver interface (which 
is not documented). Also in these ways both camps are satisfied.
