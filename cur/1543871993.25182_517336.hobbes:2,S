Hi list,
I am using kernel 2.6.20.1. I have written a module,which will
register a function at local_in hook, i have found a strange behavior
with the packets getting in my callback function i.e
[let say i am sending 1500 bytes to this machine from the network]
ping -s 1500 <ip>
1>in case of fragmention i am getting only one packet at the
hook,While analyzing the ip header it says this is the assembled
packet(skb->len=1528,offset=0,MF=0).
While dumping the data(for 0 to 1528 print skb->data[i]) it shows that
only 1472 bytes are valid data and rest 28 bytes are something
garbage.
I verified this with ethereal.
2>I have dumped these packets in ip_local_deliver function after
ip_defrag and before NF_HOOK,But the result is same.
Can Anybody let me know why i am not getting the complete data ?
Regards,
kanhu
