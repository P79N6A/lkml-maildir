Indeed. This is one of the bugs my patch addresses. NTP adjustments are
made as frequency adjustments for a entire interval, rather then fixed
value adjustments made at tick time. Thus time is accumulated in the
same way it is calculated in gettimeofday, avoiding time
inconsistencies. 
However, my code does require periodic_hook be called at least once per
rollover of the clocksource counter, so that we get a chance to
accumulate time properly. But considering the current code has issues if
we miss a single tick, I consider it an improvement. :)
