The alim15x3 driver gives me better performance on my hard disk (in
both throughput and latency/jitter) than I get from my scsi disk.
Very exciting!  However, reads on my CD-ROM are stalling.
This is on an Asus P5A-B motherboard using kernel 2.2.10 patched with
2.2.10.uniform-ide-6.20.draco.patch.gz.  The hard disk is master on
ide0 and the CD-ROM is slave on ide1.  No boot options were given.
Best,
Eric
