Subject: [PATCH 02/10] [PATCH] Fix fs/exec.c:788 (de_thread()) BUG_ON
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
It turns out that the BUG_ON() in fs/exec.c: de_thread() is unreliable
and can trigger due to the test itself being racy.
de_thread() does
 	while (atomic_read(&sig->count) > count) {
	}
	.....
	.....
	BUG_ON(!thread_group_empty(current));
but release_task does
	write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock)
	__exit_signal
		(this is where atomic_dec(&sig->count) is run)
	__exit_sighand
	__unhash_process
		takes write lock on tasklist_lock
		remove itself out of PIDTYPE_TGID list
	write_unlock_irq(&tasklist_lock)
so there's a clear (although small) window between the
atomic_dec(&sig->count) and the actual PIDTYPE_TGID unhashing of the
thread.
And actually there is no need for all threads to have exited at this
point, so we simply kill the BUG_ON.
Big thanks to Marc Lehmann who provided the test-case.
