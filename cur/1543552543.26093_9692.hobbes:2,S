These options are ignored.  linux/fs/ext2/super.c from 2.2.18-pre17:
        /* Silently ignore the quota options */
        else if (!strcmp (this_char, "grpquota")
                 || !strcmp (this_char, "noquota")
                 || !strcmp (this_char, "quota")
                 || !strcmp (this_char, "usrquota"))
                /* Don't do anything ;-) */ ;
        else {
                printk ("EXT2-fs: Unrecognized mount option %s\n",
this_char);
                return 0;
        }

Don't mount so many filesystems, or don't use so many no-op options :)
