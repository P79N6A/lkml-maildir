**********************************
Long caution list :: THIS IS A SINGLE PCI CARD.......
This is a single chipset with a double pci function, with one per channel.
00:13.0 Class 0180: 1103:0004 (rev 01)		IDE 1
00:13.1 Class 0180: 1103:0004 (rev 01)		IDE 2
These appears to be a possible hardware raid in the future, speculation on
my part.  This is based on the fact that secondary channel on both
functions are not connected.  If you call "pci=reverse" you will need to
crack your cased and physically changed the connects for each hwif.
Normal PCI scanning:
					markings	reality
00:13.0 Class 0180: 1103:0004 (rev 01)	IDE 1		IDE 1
00:13.1 Class 0180: 1103:0004 (rev 01)	IDE 2		IDE 2
Reverse PCI scanning:
					markings	reality
00:13.0 Class 0180: 1103:0004 (rev 01)	IDE 1		IDE 2
00:13.1 Class 0180: 1103:0004 (rev 01)	IDE 2		IDE 1
HPT366: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 99
HPT366: reg5ah=0x03 ATA-33 Cable Port1
    ide2: BM-DMA at 0xec00-0xec07, BIOS settings: hde:pio, hdf:pio
HPT366: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 98
HPT366: reg5ah=0x01 ATA-66 Cable Port0
    ide3: BM-DMA at 0xe800-0xe807, BIOS settings: hdg:pio, hdh:pio
Examine above Port0 == primary channel, Port1 == secondary channel.
I called pci=reverse to boot the AEC6210 card.
Until I can figure out what kind of workaround for a pci-quirk with
Martin, I do not have an answer for the device pair inversion based on the
the pci-scan order.
The chipset will auto tun itself correctly.
*** WARNING FOR ""HDPARM"" JUNKIES ***
Do not DICK/SCREW with any settings that "HDPARM" can change!!!!!
YOU WILL CRASH YOUR SYSTEM
*** WARNING FOR ""HDPARM"" JUNKIES ***
The only thing that you are allowed to change is `-d' settings.
That is DMA on/off.  If you think about unmasking, speed, bit-xfer, etc...
DON'T DO IT.  I will not listen or answer your problems if you blow of
this warning..........
