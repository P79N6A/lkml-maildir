Subject: [OT] gcc-3 problem (oops in df)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I see people on this list are using gcc-3 snapshots, so I thought I'd ask
advice here to narrow the problem down, before posting a gcc bug report.
I've been sitting on this for a couple of days without getting anywhere.
If I use a recent gcc snapshot (example : 4th June), I get an oops if I
try to use "df". The following output from ksymoops relates to a recent 
example. No modules were loaded at the time, so the modules file was 
empty.
Can people on this list using x86 gcc-3 snapshots let me know if
"df" works for them, and if so a summary of their hardware / .config . 
"df" only gets as far as printing the column titles before the oops occurs. 
As far as I can tell, the only things at all out of the ordinary are that 
I have an AMD K6-2/500 and one of my partitions uses reiserfs (which was 
why I tried -ac6).
The oops follows, I wasn't using any modules at the time.
ksymoops 2.4.1 on i586 2.4.5-ac6.  Options used
     -V (default)
     -k /proc/ksyms (default)
     -l /proc/modules (default)
     -o /lib/modules/2.4.5-ac6/ (default)
     -m /boot/System.map-2.4.5-ac6 (specified)
No modules in ksyms, skipping objects
Warning (read_lsmod): no symbols in lsmod, is /proc/modules a valid lsmod file?

1 warning issued.  Results may not be reliable.
For what it's worth, I also get the "probable hardware bug. clock timer"
message from this kernel with the gcc-3 snapshot. The mobo is a Jetway
542C, with an ALi chipset.
Needless to say, everything works fine with gcc-2.96. .config and dmesg
output attached.
Cheers.
Ken
