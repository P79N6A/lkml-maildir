And thats what swap_writepage() is doing:
static int swap_writepage(struct page *page)
{
        /* One for the page cache, one for this user, one for page->buffers */
        if (page_count(page) > 2 + !!page->buffers)
                goto in_use;
        if (swap_count(page) > 1)
                goto in_use;
...
}
