So for those architectures where there are not weird ties I think
it makes sense.  One function to allocate a linux irq number and
another function to use it for something.  I just looked and it looks
relatively easy to refactor that part of the code so we do the work
with one architecture call and not too.  Both calls always happen
within close proximity to each other.  So that fact I use two
functions appears to be incidental instead of fundamental.

My apologies for the conflict.  I had hoped to catch you at OLS so
I could get a better understanding of how things look in ppc land but
we never ran into each other.  I also posted a precursor to this design
with the hypertransport irqs and asked for comments.

Sure, and I left it to the architecture, so there should be no problem
there.
Mostly it looks like to meet your needs more of msi.c needs to be
turned into library functions that most architectures can use but your
weird cases on ppc can skip.

I knew there was a hypervisor issue but I don't have enough visibility
there so I didn't even try. 
I have a weird concern coming from working with the infinipath driver,
and that is what happens if someone almost implements msi and puts the
registers in the wrong location.

The problem is simply we have 2 irq controllers in play.  The
one on the chip and the one your the msi is targeted at.  It might
be easiest to add an extra pointer in struct irq to handle the case
of irq controllers on plug in devices.

That doesn't feel right when you can have up to 4K irqs per device.
Using using the msi_desc array is a reasonable short term solution
but I am hoping at some point to kill all of the NR_IRQ arrays
so we can more efficiently have a sparsely populated irq space.
But I would really like something like a slot I can use in struct
irq_desc.

Sounds good to me.  One small step at a time.  As long as we keep
things in terms of linux irq numbers in the generic code.  I really
don't much care.
Let's just take this one small step at a time and fix the issues that
we see and understand well.   All I know is that the original code was
so horrible that when I replicated the code across 3 different
architectures the total number of lines went down.
There are things in that code like msi_lock that I think are totally
unnecessary but haven't been annoying enough for me to kill.
I'm just glad things are now close enough people can imagine
how to go from where we are to where the code needs to be.
