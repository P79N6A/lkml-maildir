Sure, but ext3 needs to cache the information in the file handle,
because it's dynamic, per-directory stream information that needs to
be cached.  The fundamental problem is the broken nature of the 64-bit
cookie; it simply isn't big enough.  So what's being disputed is who
gets to pay the cost of that particular design mistake, in POSIX and
in NFS?
In the POSIX case, right now only applications that use
telldir/seekdir pay the cost, which is they might see some repeated
directory entries in the case of hash collisions.
Unfortunately, in the NFS case if there are hash collisions, under the
wrong circumstances the NFS client could loop forever trying to
readdir() a directory stream.

Well, we could also say that it is NFS's fault that they used a
limited size cookie as a fundamental part of their protocol....

This solution requires an incompatible file format change.  In
addition, it means trying to garbage collect directory entries when at
the beginning or end of a directory block without dragging in the
previous or next directory block.  This is a huge amount of hair, will
screw over performance, and is not compatible with how we do things
today.  
(It also means that you have to store the hash in the directory entry,
which we don't do today, since we can always calculate the hash from
the file name.  But if in some cases the hash is going to be some
small integer plus the calculated hash, you have to bloat the
directory entry by an extra 8 bytes per dirent.)
Again, compared to a directory fd cache, what you're proposing a huge
hit to the filesystem, and at the moment, given that telldir/seekdir
is rarely used by everyone else, it's mainly NFS which is the main bad
actor here by insisting on the use of a small 31/63-bit cookie as a
condition of protocol correctness.
