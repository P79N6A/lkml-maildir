Hi!
I already had some problems with Kernel 2.2.10. After a while the response
times to pings dropped from 100ms to about 4s or more. However, sometimes
there were fast replies of 100ms, probably one out of twenty.
Now I have the same problem with 2.2.11, but a little bit different. The
response times also drop from 100ms to 3s, but this time _all_ replies
come back that fast / slow.
This might as well not be a real kernel problem, but a problem with the
isdn stuff, but I thought I could post that message on that list anyway.
Hope I didn't add too much noise...
Now to the hardware:
Realtek NE2000 PCI w/ RTL8029
Elsa Quickstep 1000 PCI  (ISDN card)
isdnctrl version 3.1beta1
Since I'm not that familiar with kernel stuff and debugging, please tell
me what I can do to track down the source of that problem.
Reg.,
Jonas Jochum
