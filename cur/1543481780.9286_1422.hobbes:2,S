Personally, I don't need it. I can see why the original poster
might want it though: some people like the microkernel design,
and they might want to use some of the concepts on Linux.
Maybe they would implement a Win32 server like NT 3.x had.
(I assume that normal people want to keep Win32 out of the kernel)
(yes, I know about WINE - it is not complete either)

No, Linux capabilities grant special privilege.
True capability systems can control object access.
True capabilities take the place of ACLs and could
even take the place of the process UID and GID.
It is a very strange concept. I'm not sure how practical it
could be, but at least one unixy system (DG-UX) can use
capabilities in addition to normal security.
