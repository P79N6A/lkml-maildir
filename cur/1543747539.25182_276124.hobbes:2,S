They may not end up in order if they are stores (the stores to the
taskfile may be out of order vs; the loads/stores to/from the data
register) unless you have a spinlock protecting both or a full sync (on
ppc), but then, I don't know the ordering things on x86_64. This could
certainly be a problem on ppc & ppc64 too.
