Side note: even if we never intend to support multiple VGA cards in
separate domains, it still make sense to have a way to match an ISA
hole to it's hosting PCI bus (if any). The VGA card may not actually
be on the primary bus of a multiple-bus machine (and the very notion
of primary bus makes few sense in multi domain environements anyway)
