[I'm just wading back into a mass of neglected email. Long story.]
Chris is right, this is precisely why the interface is versioned, and
there is at least one version of libcap that was written to support this
versioning scheme
cvs -z3
- -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.linux-privs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/linux-privs
co -r libcap-pre2 libcap
I'll try and unwind all the threads of email I've been neglecting and
have something useful to say over the next few days.
Cheers
Andrew
