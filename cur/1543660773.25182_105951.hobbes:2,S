Yes, this driver might be converted to pnp_device, but I don't like that 
and I won't do that. I'm actually trying to make some consensus with Adam 
to remove the whole broken pnpc stuff, because the current model is simply 
bad and reintroduce something like enhanced pnp_device model when more pnp 
devices can be probed and grabbed at once. When things are settled down, 
I'll convert all ALSA drivers to new PnP interface immediately.
