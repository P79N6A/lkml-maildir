You need to reinstall your header files either from backups or from
your distribution. Just overwrite /usr/include/... on down and it will
fix it. Lucky you didn't overwrite libraries ;) That would require
starting from scratch.
In the future, you need to build pthreads into/at-the-same-time as
you build a 'C' runtime library. They then get installed together to
keep them compatible.

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
