Hi all,
I have created today's linux-next tree at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git.
Between each merge, the tree was built with allmodconfig for both
powerpc and x86_64.
You can see which trees have been included by looking in the Trees file
in the source.
The tree is now tagged with a tag like next-YYYYMMDD and has a
localversion-next file which adds "-next-YYYYMMDD" to the kernel revision.
There were a couple of merge conflicts and one build failure and the
appropriate people contacted.
We are up to 18 trees, more are welcome.
