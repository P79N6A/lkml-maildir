Subject: [PATCH] init: support preset lpj value as config option
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Often, it is useful to preserve the preset loops_per_jiffy
value for a machine in a config option. Right now, you can
specify a preset lpj value on the kernel command line. But this
means the value is preserved in the firmware, which is less
portable between developers.
This patch provides a config option for preset lpj, which means
the value can be easily preserved, and conveyed between developers
in a config file.

+	  Set this to preset the number of loops used by delay() to
+	  achieve a single jiffy of delay inside the kernel.  This is
+	  normally calculated at boot time, but that calibration can
+	  take up to 250 ms per CPU.  Specifying a constant value here
+	  eliminates the calibration, and improves bootup time.
+
+	  A value of 0 results in the normal autodetect behavior.
+
+	  To determine the correct value for your kernel, first set this
+	  option to 0, compile and boot the kernel on your target hardware,
+	  then see what value is printed during the kernel boot.  Use that
+	  value here.
+
+	  The kernel command line parameter "lpj=" can be used to override
+	  the value configured here.
+
+	  Note that on SMP systems the preset will be applied to all CPUs,
+	  which could cause problems if for some reason your CPUs need
+	  significantly divergent settings.
+
+	  If unsure, set this to 0. An incorrect value will cause delays in
+	  the kernel to be wrong, leading to unpredictable I/O errors and
+	  other breakage.  Although unlikely, in the extreme case this might
+	  damage your hardware.
