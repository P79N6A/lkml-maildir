Isn't that what modules and kmod are for?

I doubt that much of libc will prove to be useful for the purpose of driving 
Winmodems.

Depends on your viewpoint, and your average caffeine intake. Either way - it's 
not a valid criterion on which to base such a choice - unless the technical 
merit of either possibility is so close that it makes sense just to choose the 
easy one.
However, Winmodems are often likely to require some approximation of real-time
response from the driver, and the best place to put that is in the kernel.
There's a case for putting the AT command set emulation in user-space - in 
fact I'd go further and say there's a case for abolishing it altogether. Use 
ioctls for the various commands instead of AT-codes, and provide a library 
which opens and accesses the device on behalf of the client programs - cf. 
SANE and ESD.
