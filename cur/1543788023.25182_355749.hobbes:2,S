It's after too much of the boot. e.g. consider analyzing log with a boot hang.
It's important to know if the NMI watchdog runs or not. For that it is
best when the test of it happens as early as possible.

That would be fine as long as it's as early as possible.
But I suspect you'll always need special cases for the BP
because it needs the timer running first.
