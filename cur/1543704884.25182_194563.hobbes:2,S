For 64-bit it goes into a single 64-bit register.
And for 32-bit the sequence is high 32-bits low 32-bits.
At least on Sparc.
extern void foo(long long a);
void bar(void)
{
    foo(1);
}
/* gcc -m32 -S -o bar.s bar.c */
bar:
	!#PROLOGUE# 0
	save	%sp, -104, %sp
	!#PROLOGUE# 1
	mov	0, %o0
	mov	1, %o1
	call	foo, 0
	 nop
	nop
	ret
	restore
/* gcc -m64 -S -o bar.s bar.c */
bar:
	!#PROLOGUE# 0
	save	%sp, -192, %sp
	!#PROLOGUE# 1
	mov	1, %o0
	call	foo, 0
	 nop
	nop
	return	%i7+8
