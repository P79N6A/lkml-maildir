Why should this is be a problem? - Considering you are talking embedded 
devices here you just need to take a stable kernel, write your driver for 
it and never change kernel. No need. Also you might want to consider one of 
the embedded/realtime Linux offerings out there.

Read A. Rubbini's Linux Device Drivers 2nd ed from O'Reilly. Have a look at 
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/linuxdrive2/
 where you can also find the 
online edition of the book.
>What do you think? Is Linux the ideal platform for me?
Of course! But then again I am biased. (-; To what other OS do you have all 
the source code with the rights modify it at will? And for what other OS 
can you get help while developing drivers in such an efficient manner as is 
possible with LKML and the other Linux mailinglists/newsgroups/irc? I have 
no idea about ISA handling and Linux so can't comment on technicallities of 
this but in view of embedding it, Linux is probably a good choice for you.
HTH,
Anton
