Failure path appears incomplete, surely you don't want to register a
reboot notifier then unload and error ?

This function returns an error and should be checked. (The tricks with
IOC bits and verify_area aren't enough to be sure it won't error and
actually probably aren't worth doing)

Unreachable code.
Also if this is a software watchdog why is it better than using
softdog ?
Otherwise it looks pretty sound.
