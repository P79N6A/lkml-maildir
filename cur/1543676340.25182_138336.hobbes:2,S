Subject: 2.5.70-bk10 oops when trying to mount root from raid-1 device

2.5.70-bk10 has some raid fixes, but raid-1 still fails unlike
2.5.70-mm4.
bk10 successfully discovers raid-1 and raid-0 arrays,
but this happens when the kernel tries to mount root:
<lots of ordinary boot messages>
md ... autorun DONE
<this is where I normally get VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
  I got this instead:>

This is a dual celeron with two scsi disks, with
two raid-1 arrays and one raid-0.  The
kernel is compiled with preempt and devfs,
using gcc-3.3
