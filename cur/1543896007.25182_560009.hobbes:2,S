    fbdev: don't show logo if driver or fbcon are modular
    It was always intended for the logo to be drawn only if both fbcon and the
    driver that is mapped to it are both compiled statically.  Currently, if fbc
    is loaded prior to the driver, the logo is not shown.  Reverse the order, an
    the code may attempt to draw the logo which is __initdata.  By accident, thi
    bug is rarely seen because this method of loading the modules is not common
    and secondly, a code in fb_prepare_logo() that checks the height of the logo
    (now a random value) rarely succeeds.
    Fix by drawing the logo only if both fbcon and the driver are statically
    compiled.
