If it were that simple to print the location, I had done it already. :)
Try this:
config FOO
        bool
        select BAR
        depends on BAR
config BAR
        bool
I looked into this before, for simple properties one could just remember 
the last checked property via a static variable. The problem are the 
selects which are checked before that loop, here the information from 
where they were selected is not available anymore (at least not easily).
bye, Roman
