I think one has to <somehow> find that the chip has halted besides
the current way (noticing that it can't transmit anymore). I don't
know how to do this, of course, but; if you could know that the
chip is hung, the first thing to do is to turn off its interrupt
request(s) (the chip, not the interrupt controller). Some older
(National) devices needed to have the chip then set to loopback
mode because they couldn't be programmed properly if data kept
coming in on the wire. The internal buffer pointers kept changing
in response to incoming data while the chip was being programmed.
By the time you got the chip programmed, it was hung by pointer-wrap.
In the chip-halted work-around that everybody seems to use now,
reprogram it from scratch. The last program operation being to remove
loop-back. I don't even know if this chip can be set to loop-back,
though, so the whole idea may be moot.
Cheers,
