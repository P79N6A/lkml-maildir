I gave it a try. Sleepy is my server (also my desktop machine at home),
Ricci is a dual P-133 in a mini-cluster.  Networking is 100 Mbit, a
3c905b-TX on Sleepy and a generic Winbond 840 network card on Ricci. 
Sleepy is running kernel 2.2.2-ac5 with the user-space nfsd. Ricci is
running 2.1.122. 
The file is written in a subdirectory of /mnt/data, with mount options:
sleepy:/data on /mnt/data type nfs
(rw,rsize=4096,wsize=4096,hard,intr,posix,addr=192.168.1.1)
[dwhysong@ricci test]$ cat /dev/zero > junk
[Time passes... I am definately seeing NFS stalling occasionally]
[root@Sleepy test]# ls -l
total 280476

I stopped it after about 300 megabytes had been written. No problems, but
it's not quite the same setup that you have.
