The main problem I see with this is having to walk and free each
chain with the lock held.  We could avoid this if we had a pointer
in struct rtable to chain them up for freeing later.
I just checked and struct rtable is 236 bytes long on 32-bit but
the slab cache pads it to 256 bytes so we've got some free space.
I suspect 64-bit should be similar.
Cheers,
