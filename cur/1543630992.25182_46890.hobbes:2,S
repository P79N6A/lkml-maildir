IIRC, Kbuild-2.5 already silently accepts all of the old kbuild-2.4 commands
without problems.
As long as you end up running "make install" the rest of the old commands
will be ignored.  You can go on with all of the old commands, if you want
without any trouble.  This will allow you to use the same commands with
kbuild-2.4 and kbuild-2.5, in case you decide to switch between both kernels
and want to use the same commands.
Also kbuild-2.5 does have features that allow you to call scripts from "make
install", but it's not mandatory.
Kieth, can you confirm that all of the old kbuild-2.4 commands have been
wrapped in kbuild-2.5 commands?
Thanks,
Mike
