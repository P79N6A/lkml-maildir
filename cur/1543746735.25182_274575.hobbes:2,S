I should probably correct this a wee bit.  I don't have jack or its 
cousins installed, but have been using tvtime as a stress tester of 
sorts.  Now running the 31-7 version, but 31-3 gave similar results.
Everything seems clean, and a bit snappier than usual and even tvtime, 
which runs with a nice of -19 gives me a much smoother pix, less 
stuttering than before, to the point where I at first thought it was 
indeed keeping up.  But that, from my logs, appears not to be the 
case as I now have about a 60 megabyte messages file, which generally 
speaking looks normal till I fire up tvtime.  At that point the logs 
start filling up with messages from the debugging options like this, 
which is the last screenfull of a 1 minute run that added a meg or so  
to the file:

---------------------------------
Is there some option I can set or disable so it only prints the ending 
summary to the log?
Also, this is with the anticipatory scheduler, cfq is noticably better 
as maintaining the interactivity feel of the system, but doesn't seem 
to effect the above reporting to the log one way or the other..
However, using cfq doubles the runtime for the nightly amanda session.
Amanda doesn't appear to mind.
All told, Ingo, I'm very impressed, this is as sweet as this system 
has ever run!  Now if I could just get verizon to throw enough iron 
into their mailservers so they will catchup and go realtime again.
