Sounds reasonable by itself.

But longer (or not so long) term moving the IOAPIC earlier is the better option, 
simply because the short use of PIC mode traditionally was a source of problems
on a lot of boxes.
And it does not really make sense to keep this source of trouble just for a short 
time during boot when we could as well go directly into IO-APIC mode. This would 
probably also match what other OS are doing better and that is always a good idea
for stable operation.
