Its OK, our web server currently doesn't have this problem :)
I ran into the problem developing code that wrote data out of a circular
buffer - so the data being written may potentially be in two sections if
the buffer wraps around. A generic writev() call then emptied as much data
out of the buffer as possible, and so tripping the bug. I guess what I'm saying
is that you don't have to have plain dumb code (like the example code I
gave) in order to hit this problem.
Paranoia check: can this bug occur with writev() and other combinations of
sizes, or is it only when there is a 0-length buffer in there?
