SCSI, SATA and SAS drives all offer a FORMAT command. The Drive
manufacturers will perform whatever operations they deem fit to this
command (if available).
The Low Level Format option in the BIOS configuration tool will issue
this command. There is also options for a Zero or Secure Format, which
writes patterns to the drives.
