Are you willing to stand up for that and be the maintainer for it?
I'm disgusted by how many people have been complaining, yet when I ask 
people to step up and actually _do_ something about it, people suddenly 
become very quiet, or continue complaining about it ignoring the 
fundamental issue.
Everybody (including you, Alan, so don't go hoity-toity on us) has
apparently totally ignored my calls for a new maintainer, and asking the 
people involved who wrote parts of the driver for their input. I quote an 
email from me:

	I'd suggest you contact the people who have worked on that driver (there's 
	certainly people outside of nemosoft, at least according to the 
	changelogs) and see what they feel like and try to gauge how much they 
	were part of driver development.

I've got _lots_ of emails in my mailbox complaining.
I don't have a _single_ one actually responding for my calls to actually 
_do_ something about the driver.
Until people turn from whiners to doers, nothing will happen.
