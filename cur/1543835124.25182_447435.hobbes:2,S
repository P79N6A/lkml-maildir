Non-standard functions must be handled reasonably within the
framework, otherwise drivers will have to build duplicate interfaces.
How about
  /sys/whatever/battery0/voltage for standard attributes
and
  /sys/whatever/battery0/thinkpad/inhibit-charge-minutes
for non-standard ones?

Likewise for cached attributes (query hardware only if N jiffies
passed since last querry, other return cached value). And that way,
hardware query frequency is never higher than what userspace actually
needs.
