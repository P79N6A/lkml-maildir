    Have you tried it in a different motherboard?  It's possible that
    the motherboard is what's causing you grief, not the card (I've not
    worked with the FA310TX on many motherboards, since I'm trying to
    standardise on the FIC PA2013, but the netgears work fine for me on
    those, the FIC VA503+, the FIC VB601V -- all three with VIA Apollo
    chipsets -- as well as an elderly single-level ATX motherboard I dug
    out of the discard bin at a web vendor and one of the first
    SuperMicro Pentium II motherboards.)
    In all of these cases, I've used the driver that was supplied with
    the card, because it's very happy with those cards and it gets along
    well with other tulips too.
