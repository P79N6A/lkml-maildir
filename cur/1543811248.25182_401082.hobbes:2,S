This is definitely a problem.  We have an x86-specific hack in our
driver that diddles the MTRRs to make sure that our MMIO space has write
combining enabled.
On other platforms, it looks like write combining, if supported at all,
is implemented in the northbridge.  For those, I think we'd need to mark
the device's mapping as cacheable.

OK, thanks for the feedback.
