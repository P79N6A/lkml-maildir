Hi,
While we're at it, the fan speed sensor reports an absurd speed when the fan 
is driven with very low but non-zero pwm values.  For example, driving it 
with pwm=2 I get speeds over 50K rpms, while of course the fan is stopped 
(almost?).  This could be just an hardware sensitivity problem in the sensor 
chip, or a false measure triggered by fan vibration, but maybe you know 
better.
