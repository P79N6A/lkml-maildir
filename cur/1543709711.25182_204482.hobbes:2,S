Ingo, Andrea,
I would not say MySQL calls time that often, it is normally 2 times per
query (to measure query execution time), might be couple of times more.
Looking at typical profiling results it takes much less than 1% of time,
even for  very simple query loads. 
Rather than changing design how time is computed I think we would better
to go to better accuracy - nowadays 1 second is far too raw.
