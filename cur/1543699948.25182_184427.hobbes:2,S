Masking OFF the timer channel 0 in the interrupt controller
is probably the easiest thing to do. The port is read-write,
and the OCW default to having it accessible.
	movw	$0x21, %dx	# Controller 0, mask register
	inb	%dx, %al	# Get mask
	orb	$1, %al		# Mask off bit 0
	outb	%al, %dx	# Write it back
You can reenable by:
	movw	$0x21, %dx
	inb	%dx, %al
	andb	$~1, %al
	outb	%al, %dx
With port numbers less that 256, you actually don't need the
DX register but I forget if the AT&T assembler needs a $ before
the port number when doing this.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
