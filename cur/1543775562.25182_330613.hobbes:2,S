Ok, that locking can now be removed :)

hot-plugging a ps/2 device is a short trip to a burnt out motherboard.
I've worked with the ps/2 specs long enough to know that :)
Anyway, you aren't discovering them on the fly, but I see how a rescan
would help you out here, right?

I don't like "modes" like that.  Just have the driver have no built in
ids, then use the addition of a dynamic id from userspace do the bind,
like pci.

Sure, for this I think it should be a bus specific thing.

But rescan/reconnect is a bus thing.  The driver core never kicks this
off, nor should it.

per-device scan doesn't make much sense for other busses, does it?

The driver is the thing you want to have bound to a device.  Putting it
in every device directory would make the 20K scsi device people very
unhappy as I take up even more of their 31bit memory :)

Ah, ok, now I remember.  I still think this is more complex than needed,
but don't have an alternative proposal right now :)
