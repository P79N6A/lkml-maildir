A couple of points about NetBSD partitions under linux:
1) NetBSD is changing its partition id from the old 0xa5 to 0xa9. Due
to this, NetBSD partitions are no longer recognized by the code in
drivers/block/genhd.c, which only checks 0xa5.
2) This second is really a question re the ufs filesys. I have two NetBSD
partitions, one / and one /usr. ufs mounts the root partition, but says
that /usr has a bad magic number. According to NetBSD, it has the correct
one: 0x00011954. The partitions were formatted with NetBSD-1.3.3. I suspect
that ufs can't read the superblock correctly: with debugging turned on, I
got the magic number as 0. Is there any updated version of the ufs filesys
which does support NetBSD?
