Most BIOSes will let you set the boot order to SCSI first.  But yes,
LILO may still think that the SCSI disk is 0x82, but you can tell LILO
that your SCSI drive is really your boot device.
disk = /dev/sda
  bios = 0x80
I do have a mixed IDE/SCSI setup, but luckly I've only a 2.4 GB IDE
drive to phase out, when I switch over to a SCSI only setup.
