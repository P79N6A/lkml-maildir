What I was thinking of was to use some of the spare termios cflag bits
to select the flow control.  You'd only want one flow control type at
one time though.  Eg: define two fields, each to select the signal.
0 - RTS
1 - DTR
0 - CTS
1 - DTR
2 - DSR
You still want CRTSCTS to enable hardware flow control though - which
is what programs expect to happen with that flag enabled.  RTS/CTS
flow control would be type 0 above for compatibility with existing
programs.
However, bear in mind that the majority of the more inteligent 8250-
compatible UARTs with large FIFOs only do hardware flow control on
RTS/CTS - attempting to simulate hardware flow control on the other
signals could end up with up to 64 or 128 characters being sent after
the transmit handshake is deasserted.
