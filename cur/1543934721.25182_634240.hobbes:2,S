The while (--l) {...} pushes+adds DLE for len-1 characters.
( while (l--) would process all len characters)
The last charater is assigned to "last" and pushed after the else block:

But this does not care about a DLE and doesn't escape that with another DLE.

For an audio data stream we have to escape DLE (ascii 16) by another DLE,
otherwise it is interpreted as command, as in Documentation/isdn/README.audio:
...  escape sequences defined, all using DLE (0x10) as Escape char:...
    <DLE><DLE>              Escape sequence for DLE in data stream.
    <DLE>0                  Touchtone "0" received.
...
