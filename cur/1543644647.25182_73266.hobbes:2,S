I've got a VT6105 Rhine-III card (an actual PCI card, not embedded on my
mobo). It works fine with SuSE's 2.4.18 kernel (the driver seems unpatched
in that kernel), but it gives transmit timed out errors in 2.4.20pre7. No
data hits the wire at all.
This is kernel 2.4.20pre7:

http://www.scyld.com/network/via-rhine.html
| eth0: VIA VT6105 Rhine-III at 0xd000, 00:40:f4:5f:94:d6, IRQ 16.
| eth0: MII PHY found at address 1, status 0x7869 advertising 05e1 Link 45e1.

| NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
| eth0: Transmit timed out, status 0003, PHY status 786d, resetting...
And this is 2.4.18-4GB (SuSE 8.0 standard kernel):

| PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 00:0d.0
| eth0: VIA VT6105 Rhine-III at 0xcc00, 00:40:f4:5f:94:d6, IRQ 11.
| eth0: MII PHY found at address 1, status 0x786d advertising 05e1 Link 45e1.
| eth0: Setting full-duplex based on MII #1 link partner capability of 45e1.
Note that I've got local APIC support compiled in on the 2.4.20 kernel.
Could this be the cause of the problem?
It's a MSI 745 Ultra board (SiS 745 based).
The NIC is: 00:0d.0 Class 0200: 1106:3106 (rev 85)
