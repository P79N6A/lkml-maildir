Because the mutex release is done in two stages: (1) clear the state bit and
(2) set the owner pointer to NULL.
This is a sufficient window for a potential mutex grabber to jump in grab the
mutex and then have stage (2) clobber the owner pointer.
Anyway, I've changed this now (though I haven't got around to testing it yet):
On platforms that support cmpxchg(), it uses the owner pointer as the state
and exchanges it to NULL to release the mutex, and exchanges it to the owner
pointer when grabbing.
On platforms that don't, a spinlock is added to the WineMutex structure.
