Subject: [patch] time_after_eq fix

Hello,
The two macros time_after and time_after_eq were added to do wrapping
correctly, but only time_after does it the right way, time_after_eq has
been wrong since the very beginning(v2.1.127, 07-Nov-1998).  Now this
patch fixes it.
And I don't agree with the the original code comment. I don't think this
is gcc's fault.  If it is "a good compiler" or "a really good compiler",
trying to be smarter than human, it wouldn't still be a C compiler.
So I'd like it be removed.
