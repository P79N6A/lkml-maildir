Kinda like the QPL applied to patents:
"We've contributed some code to Linux which uses one of our patents. If you
want to use this code to write other GPL'ed code, go right ahead. If you
want to use this code in a non-Free product, you'll have to pay us!"
I'd like to think that would be acceptable to all parties.
