Phy, you and I have corresponded off list. I think we are experiencing 
the same thing...

Is there any way to get similar numbers system wide on 2.4? This exists 
for 2.6.x, and the latest sysstat shows it with sar -B, but as the sar 
manpage states, the fault/s numbers are not available on 2.4. :(
