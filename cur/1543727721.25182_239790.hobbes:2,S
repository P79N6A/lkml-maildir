Actually there is a seperate complication here for disks that probably
makes the problem a bit more complex for anything with partitions - that
is that SCSI commands are not per partition and I agree with you that we
don't want to get into filtering on that basis. Probably
that means CAP_SYS_RAWIO for anything not the true "whole device" node.
That leaves commands to one device that affect another "disk"  - eg a
firmware upgrade on a big storage array but those are RAWIO things
anyway
