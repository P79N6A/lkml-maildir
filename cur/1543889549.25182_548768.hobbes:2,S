Because the purpose of .h files is to be included in more than one .c file.  
(Otherwise it should be a .c file.)
And if you #include a non-inlined definition in two .c files, the compiler 
will emit two copies into two separate .o files.  What you're hoping is that 
the linker will notice they're identical and merge them, and last I checked I 
couldn't even reliably get it to do that with constant strings.

If we put it in a header, it's because we want it inlined.  If we don't want 
it inlined it SHOULDN'T BE IN THE HEADER.
If the compiler can emit a warning "inline insanely large", we can use that to 
fix it.  But a warning is not the same as silently doing something other than 
what we told it to do.
