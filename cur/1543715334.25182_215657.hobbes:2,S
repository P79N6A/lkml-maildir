You can't do that with the current timer code. A HZ timer interrupt is used
for several things: 1) increase jiffies_64, 2) update the xtime, 3) calculate
the load every 5 seconds, 4) check cpu time limits and send SIGXCPU,
5) do interval timer stuff, 6) run local timer queue and 7) add time slice to
current process. With your one-shot timer you won't do the correct updates
to the jiffies and the xtime.
