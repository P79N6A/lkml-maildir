Greetings;
Some smallish non-progress on my CNC project.  I added the 
vendor/product description (00ff:0800) to drivers/pci/pci.ids and 
recompiled.
The data does make it into the self generated devlist.h file during 
the compile, but that appears to be as far as it gets.  On the reboot 
there is still no recognition of the cards presence in the logs, and 
the data I can extract from the /proc filesystem about the card is as 
limited as before.  It shows up on the pci bus as 00:10.0 and thats 
it.
This was using 2.6.10-rc1-bk10 as the test kernel, and on that old 
slow box, a 233mhz PII with 384 megs of ram, a kernel compile is a 
bit over 65 minutes!
I didn't ever expect that one change to be the magic twanger, but 
shouldn't I at least have seen something?
Whats the next step here since it appears I'm taking 1/64" steps?
