MMCONFIG can't be used without ACPI in any case unless we know where the 
  table is using chipset-specific knowledge (i.e. reading the registers 
directly). Doing that without being told that this area is really 
intended to be used, via the ACPI table, is dangerous, i.e. we don't 
necessarily know if the MMCONFIG is broken on the platform in some way 
we can't detect.

If someone has to turn ACPI off, disabling MMCONFIG is probably the 
least of their worries..
