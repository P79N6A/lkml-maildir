   Our flip buffers dont work at 1Mbit or higher unless you hack
   HZ. However Ted thought of this ages ago. You don't have to use flip
   buffers on receive you can store frames however you like and the feed
   them directly to the tty input layer. Several smart interfaces do
   this.
Exactly.  Flip buffers are a service provided by the tty layer; much
like the various generic VFS functions provided by the VFS layer, device
drivers don't have to use them if they aren't useful given their
particular hardware and/or design goals.
