That is not a valid reason to reject -- libata is still considered
very experimental for ATAPI devices, which are not enabled by default.
Jeff has said that he prefers (at present) for people with ATAPI drives
to use the IDE layer rather than libata, where possible.
That will change soon, but it's still the case for now.
Cheers
