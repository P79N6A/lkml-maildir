 A possible reason is the 8259A in the chipset deasserts its INT output
late enough for the Athlon CPU's local APIC to register another ExtINTA
interrupt sometimes, possibly under specific circumstances.  If that's
true, either the chipset or the APIC (or both) is at fault for not meeting
the specs.  It causes no system stability problem but there is a
performance hit due to these spurious interrupts.
