Sorry about the noise ... 
Going to another machine with a recent gcc, and re-applying the config file 
seems to work, I now got a image.
Just have to get it working now ...
Gabriel: I just got it working.
That was a plain 2.6.24.2 untar - but the "make ARCH=um bzImage" seems to make 
a mess.
Thank you nonetheless.
Regards,
Phil
