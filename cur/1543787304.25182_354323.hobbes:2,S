ok. Any clue how PCI IRQs got routed/handled on those boxes?
Did UP boards have an 8259 PIC and an IRQ line to the CPU?
Could an 8529 PIC even co-exist with an IO APIC?
Or was it something more silly like BIOS mfgs had no version
of Windows that could grok a IRQ routing table and thus no
incentive to enable that feature?
thanks,
grant
