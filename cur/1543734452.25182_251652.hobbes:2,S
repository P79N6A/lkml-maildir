Well, weak security enhancement translates to "nop" in my book, but
I guess if that's really what people were trying to arrange...

I'd favor fully pseudorandom allocation over LRU or approximate LRU
allocation, as at least pseudorandom is feasible without large impacts
on resource scalability. OTOH the cache characteristics of pseudorandom
allocation are usually poor; perhaps hierarchically pseudorandom
allocation where one probes a sequence of cachelines of the bitmap
according to one PRNG, and within each cacheline probes a random
sequence of bits according to some other PRNG, would resolve that.

The resource tracking and locking implications of this are disturbing.
Would fully pseudorandom allocation be acceptable?

Is the maximum possible pid exported by the kernel somehow? Perhaps
it should be; the maximum number of decimal digits required to
represent PID_MAX_LIMIT (4*1024*1024) should suffice in all cases.
Perhaps you need to detect PID_MAX_LIMIT somehow?
