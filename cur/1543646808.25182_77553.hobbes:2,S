O Please!  As the person that started this thread this is way way way 
way out there and quite frankly I find offensive.
I do NOT honestly think that Larry made the change to the license that 
he did for the express purpose of milking some set of companies out of 
$$$$.  That's just dumb.
Like Larry and others who have made some rather good points over the 
couple of days, I think we're all trying to find a way to reasonably 
solve this that is is everyone's best interesting, including Larry's 
company.
Granted it's a different kind of license, (IE Microsoft doesn't have a 
clause in IE that says Netscape developers can't use IE) but hey, it's 
Larry's company and he's perfectly in his rights to do so.  It is 
truely a good thing that Larry is allowing some set of us in the open 
source community to use his product without costs. Personally I'm 
willing to pay a reasonable license fee for it but it's gotta be 
something that I can afford without getting my head torn off by my 
wife. Of course the other solution is to adjust the license a bit so 
folks like me who are just doing kernel work and not in competition 
with Larry's company (no matter what others in my company are doing) 
can use it.
That's what I hope for...   maybe it'll come true.
Regards,
Tom
