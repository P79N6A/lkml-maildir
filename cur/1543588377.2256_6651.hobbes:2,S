Hi Jeff,
  Well that's problem #1. Source from kernel.org for 2.4 tends to not work on

kernel.org caught up ASAP.
  Visit here to get the up to date and sometime bleeding edge source for PPC.

Which version of gcc do you have? You want either 2.95.2 or 2.95.3

Ah YDL ... good stuff. Hope you are on 1.2 at least. 8-)
