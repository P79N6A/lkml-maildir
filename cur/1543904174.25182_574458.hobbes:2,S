Well, as I said, our test_and_set_bit() asm (and in general, the asm for
all the atomic ops that -return- a value) have at least some level of
barriers in them because of that. We do that because people are abusing
them as locks. The smp_mb__after_set_bit() I never quite grokked. We do
an mb in there but I suspect we don't need if it's only ever used after
test_and_set_bit() because of the above. The smb_mb__before_clear_bit()
makes more sense as it's supposed to give clear_bit() a spin_unlock
semantic.
But we do need the "memory" clobber as well.
That's one reason why I like Nick's bitop locks patches, providing
-explicit- test_and_set_bit_lock() and clear_bit_unlock(), we can fix a
whole lot of things and make sure they have the right barriers and not
more. (We save a few useless barriers on POWER that way in the page lock
path and it's measureable in his benchmark).
Cheers,
Ben.
