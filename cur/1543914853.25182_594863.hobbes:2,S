I meant port from main network stack. Sorry for confusion.

sizeof(struct iwch_addrlist) of course, not (*addr).
To simplify grep.

Does second case ends up with problem you described in the initial
e-mail not being fixed?

Does creating the whole new netdevice is a too big overhead, or is it
considered bad idea?

Yes, exactly.
