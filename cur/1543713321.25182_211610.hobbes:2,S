Actualy the same applies to me, when using 2.6.4. And I also get many 
of those warnings when compiling kernel modules (like Jay Maynard 
wrote):
{standard input}: Assembler messages:
{standard input}:4: Warning: setting incorrect section type for .got
{standard input}:4: Warning: setting incorrect section attributes for 
.got
So I tried 2.6.5-rc2 with the corrected version of 
"arch/alpha/kernel/alpha_ksyms.c" from rc3. The assembler messages are 
still here... the kernel compiles.... and the message "Badness in 
kobect_get" is gone when loading the sg module.
But what about those assembler messages??
Regards,
Stefan
