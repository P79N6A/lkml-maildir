According to the main page, there are three differences:
* POSIX pselect does not update the timeout argument, but linux pselect7
does, so it's easy to implement both pselect and select based on it.
* pselect also has a timespec arguement, not timeval as select, but that's
trivial to convert.
* pselect obviously takes an extra argument, but if that's NULL, it will
behave like select (aside from the timeout handling).
