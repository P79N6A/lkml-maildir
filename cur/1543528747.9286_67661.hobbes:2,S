Oh? Please, try to do the following:
mkdir /tmp/foo
cd /tmp/foo
chmod a-x .
strace ls . 2>&1|more
and watch for lstat(".") - you will be surprised. Now do
cd /tmp
ls foo
to prove that problem is _not_ in the object - it's lookup complaining
about access permissions. And here we agree with damn next to everything.
I'm too lazy to dig out the Lions Book or build Supnik's emulator and
boot the thing, but I seriously suspect that v6 gave the same behaviour.
