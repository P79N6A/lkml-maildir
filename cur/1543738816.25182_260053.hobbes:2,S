I'm just saying you are encouraging inconsistency, which is wrong.
Mark should either
a) follow the style you request, _and_ submit patches to clean up the 
SCSI core, or
b) take the lock, just like the SCSI core is doing.
I disagree with the assertion that Mark's code should be different from 
the SCSI core.
