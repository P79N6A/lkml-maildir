	What not at 10% (or other specific limit) swap space 
remaining - I belive that was my original suggestion,
and means that I CAN still run. And 100k of mlock()ed
memory would be plenty to a) renice all other processes
to 19 and b) send a little bit of X protocol to a currenlt running
X server or c) chvt() to an unused VT and use a text-based
What process do you want me to kill? dialog.
