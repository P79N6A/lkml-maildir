Last time I proposed that, the objection was how to throttle the heavy
dirtiers so they don't fill up RAM with dirty pages?
Also, how do you do atomic allocations? Create a huge memory pool and
pray really hard?

It's not a question of enough kswapds. It's that we can dirty pages
faster than they can possibly be written to disk.
