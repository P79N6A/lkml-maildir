It just seems like something that belongs in user-space -- whether that be 
better init scripts, changes to modprobe, both, or something else 
entirely.
To make a kernel implementation of this concept that isn't 
fundamentally flawed from a usability and "least-surprise" 
perspective would mean enough code and behavior that the resulting 
implementation wouldn't be considered correct for the kernel anyway.
The kernel has, fundamentally, three kinds of configuration - CONFIG_*, 
the bootloader command-line, and 'live' configuration that gets set by 
user-space whenever appropriate.
