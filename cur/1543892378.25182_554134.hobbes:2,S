Subject: [PATCH RFC 0/7] proposed updates to boot protocol and paravirt booting
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/6/479

This series:
 1. Updates the boot protocol to version 2.07
 2. Clean up the existing build process, to get rid of tools/build and
    make the linker do more heavy lifting
 3. Make the bzImage payload an ELF file.  The bootloader can extract
    this as a naked ELF file by skipping over boot_params.setup_sects worth
    of 16-bit setup code.
 4. Update the boot_params to 2.07, and update the kernel's head.S to
    jump to the appropriate subarch-specific kernel entrypoint.  The
    very earliest code is common (copy boot_params, clear bss); the
    split happens just before the initial pagetable setup.
+ random little changes to make it all hang together
This boots native for me, so everything basically works.  But I haven't
tested it end-to-end yet, because I haven't done the Xen bits yet.
Perhaps Rusty can do the lguest version to verify that its all sound in
principle (hint hint ;).
So, how does it look?
