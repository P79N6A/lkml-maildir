Subject: "DV failed to configure device" for Quantum DLT4000 tape drive on Adaptec 2940UW, 2.6.0-test11

I only use my Adaptec 2940-UW for doing weekly backups to my Quantum DLT4000
(external) tape drive. On the 2.4 kernels, I'd just modprobe aic7xx and it
would detect the tape drive, load the st module and I could do my usual tar
command to backup stuff to tape. On 2.6.0-test11, I modprobe aic7xxx and it
detects the drive but it says "scsi0:A:5:0: DV failed to configure device.
Please file a bug report against this driver." and the st module does not
get loaded.
Not sure what this means.. I didnt have this problem with 2.4.21.
However, I can modprobe st and use the tape drive just fine.
Here is the relevant bits out of my syslog:
