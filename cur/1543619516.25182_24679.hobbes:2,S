Etherboot requires a specific other driver.  The problem with what 
you're proposing -- and let me get it very clear here, it's a huge 
problem -- is that you have no device-independent access to the boot 
medium (in this case, the network) once you have loaded the initial boot 
program.  This is an enormous drawback.
That's the thing with PXE and the BIOS too, for that matter: they might 
be specs done by monkeys, but when it really counts, what you need is 
really there (modulo bugs, but that applies to everything.)
