As Jes says,
	.owner	= THIS_MODULE,
is preferred here.

There's no need to cast the return value of kmalloc.
	scd = kmalloc(sizeof(*scd), GFP_KERNEL);
would suffice here.

hm.  O_NONBLOCK means "don't wait for more input to arrive" rather than
"don't block if someone else is holding a lock I want".  But given that the
semaphore is held by !O_NONBLOCK readers, it has to be done this way.
I guess there's no bug here, but it's a bit odd.

What Jes said: return -EFAULT if copy_to_user() returns non-zero.

This function will sleep with spinlocks held, won't it?
