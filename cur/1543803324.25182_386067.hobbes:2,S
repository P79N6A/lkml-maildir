I'm not sure but I don't think those warnings are from something e100
can control.

Most people running 2.4 seem to be okay with the old driver.  We
haven't maintained it for a long time, and have moved all of our
efforts to the more maintainable (rewritten) 3.X driver.  Basically
we've taken the position that 2.4 is legacy and if it ain't broke
don't fix it.
well, you've found something that broke, but maybe someone on list
here can help with a fix, but to answer your question its unlikely
that we'll attempt to rev the 2.4 driver unless something very serious
is brought up.
I'm hoping you can get along with the 3.X driver, and I'll be glad to
look into any issues that you come up with for that driver.
