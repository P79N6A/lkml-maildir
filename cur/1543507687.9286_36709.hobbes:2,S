Hi,
i still have the same problems with the qlogic Wide SCSI Controllers.
I meanwhile did some days of testing and i can really nail it down
to the Driver for the qlogic controller (qlogicpti.c) or the
Special Revision of Controllers i have (Tried 5 alltogether in 
3 machines with a total of >30 SCSI Drives with at least 10 different
Wide SCSI Cables, and 6 different Sun Multipacks)
I have gotten back ~50 Qlogic SBUS Single Ended Wide SCSI Controllers
in ~50 Sparcserver 5 machines each equipped with a Sun Multipack with
4x4 GB Wide SCSI Drives. These machines have done Web Proxieng for
at least 3 Years so i suppose they worked as they are in front of me.
I have NO problems at all plugging a Multipack into my Symbios
Logic PCI Controller (Tekram) in my Linux/i386 box.
When i plug it into the SparcServer 5 (Same Cables, Multipack, Cable)
i am able to start rebuilding the Raid 5 but at >70% the machine starts
to have SCSI Errors for ALL devices on the wide channel.

The Qlogic controllers are ISP1000 based, Revision 01F, Build in 1993.
Is there anyone seeing similar problems ?
Is there a newer sbus qlogic driver anywhere ? (There is no diff 
		between 2.2.12 which i run and 2.3.15)
I am trying to do a Raid5 (0.90) on 6 Drives, block size 32K. No problem on
i386 with Symbios, but no-go on Sparc.
