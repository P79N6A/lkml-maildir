Well, there is at least one bug in arch/i386/kernel/i387.c regarding the
handling of mxcsr on processors with SSE2 extensions. A new mxcsr bit 
(bit 6, denormals are zero or DAZ) was defined by Intel which will be 
cleared under you when you get a signal and with some ptrace operations.
The following patch should fix this, but I'm not sure that it is your
problem, and the behaviour of SSE code will vary depending on whether
the processor has SSE2 (but blame Intel for that, not me ;-)). You don't
say which kernel you are using, so I made the patch against a very
recent pull from the from 2.5 tree, but it is trivially portable to 2.4 
and might even apply as is.

The code in arch/x86-64/ia32/fpu32.c also has a couple of 0xffbf
masks, maybe they should really be 0xffff. But I lost my x86-64 doc
in a disk crash and have not yet downloaded it again.
