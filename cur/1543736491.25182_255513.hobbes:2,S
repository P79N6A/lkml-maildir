Ah, I was using them for backing store as well and I was using the 
__attribute__((packed)) gcc extension to make them the bit-width I wanted 
in combination with a "filler element" at the end of the enum.
So for example to get a 16-bit enum type I was using:
typedef enum {
	RESTART_VOLUME_IS_CLEAN = const_cpu_to_le16(0x0002),
	REST_AREA_SPACE_FILLER  = 0xffff	/* Just to make flags 
16-bit. */
} __attribute__ ((__packed__)) RESTART_AREA_FLAGS;
And then when defining the structure containing these flags I would just 
do:
typedef struct {
	...
	RESTART_AREA_FLAGS flags;
	...
} __attribute__ ((__packed__)) RESTART_AREA;
Also I use the enum type as parameters to functions, for example in the 
above case I might have:
	int blah(RESTART_AREA_FLAGS flags);
So this use doesn't work with the sparse update either.  At the moment I 
have changed everything to just a bunch of #defines followed by a:
typedef le16 RESTART_AREA_FLAGS;
So I guess with your sparse update I can now go to a point in between the 
old one and the new one:
enum {
	RESTART_VOLUME_IS_CLEAN = const_cpu_to_le16(0x0002),
} __attribute__ ((__packed__)) RESTART_AREA_FLAGS;
typedef le16 RESTART_AREA_FLAGS;
So I get the enum rather than bunch of defines and I get my proper types 
as well.
That only looses the ability for the compiler to warn if people use the 
wrong constant when trying to set such a variable or pass a wrong constant 
into a function but that is not nearly as useful a warning as the wrong 
endianness bitwise warnings we have now gained so I am not going to worry 
about losing it.
Best regards,
	Anton
