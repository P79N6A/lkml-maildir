There is another advantage from Brian's trick of reusing the IRQ stack 
bottom: if we ever overflow the IRQ stack the kernel will likely stomp on 
the canary and overwrite it, and then (if the user runs on a 
stackprotector kernel) we will get an instantaneous assert and backtrace, 
exactly where the overflow happened.
Small overflows are otherwise rather hard to catch right on the spot so 
this is a bonus.
