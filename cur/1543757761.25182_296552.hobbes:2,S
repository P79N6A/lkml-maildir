To clarify: there were no disk I/O errors, only I/O errors were reported 
  by find during operation so it is definitely filesystem corruption 
that is  going on here.
Though find performs heavy read activity there could well be heavy write 
activity be involved due to atime updates so this fits your description.

Well, it didn't fix it for me. The fs was trashed for good. The major 
question for me is now usability of md/dm for any purpose with 2.6.x. 
For me this is a showstopper for any kind of 2.6 production use.
