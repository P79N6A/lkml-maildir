set_ld_eol() is a safe function, which is only for preparing the tx descriptors

the function append_ld_queue() should be called.

It's no problem. :) In fact, I've added out of order testing codes in fsl_dma_self_test()
 function.
But I have a question about device_prep_dma_interrupt(), which is no way to assign
 dest and src address. Is it a null tx action dma_async_tx_descriptor except to trigger
 an interrupt?
Thanks!
Wei.
