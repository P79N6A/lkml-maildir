This looks very close to a fix I have on my machine, as well, after
looking at sys_poll() a bit. I suppose the only times you would notice
are if an application actually wants as long a wait as possible, as
opposed to a very long one.
Your patch was line-wrapped and does not have a Signed-off-by line,
however. Care to try again?
Thanks,
Nish
