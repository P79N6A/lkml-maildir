This appears to be correct.  Adam (cc'd) did some work on this code, and
may have some further observations.

Yes, passing in an offset beyond the page size is wrong.
Also, I don't know why PAGE_CACHE_SIZE is being used here instead of
PAGE_SIZE.  Even though they're always the same now, I would suggest
changing all occurrences to PAGE_SIZE.
