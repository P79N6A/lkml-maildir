Because we have not seen any 8-bit hardware - let alone any 8-bit hardware
which we know how to drive. It is unclear how necessary the bus testing sequence
is, but the main reason why it's not there is that I could never get it to work
on the sdhci controller I use for testing. Due to how the CRC is handled for these
commands, the controller gets confused, reports failure, and doesn't provide the
returned data - making the test impossible.
If you have found an 8-bit controller that we can support, we'd love to know about
it!
