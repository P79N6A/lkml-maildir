Ok then. We can call pcmcia_init() before other initcall-s and make
normal drivres initcalls().

(This is not yet issue for me because I want my kernel standalone, no
modules).
IIIt should be drivers/pcmcia/net, like we have drivers/sbus/char and
drivers/acorn/net. Perhaps everything from them should go to
modules/.../pcmcia, but I do not really care.
