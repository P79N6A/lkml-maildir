It's '--color=auto' or "color tty" in /etc/DIR_COLORS
Richard - what distribution are you using that ISN'T like this?  If you
have ls using colors in the non-tty case a lot of shell scripts
break.  Non-tty ls (like "/bin/ls|cat") has a very well defined output
format since the 70s, and lots of things count on that format.
I have Redhat and Debian handy and they both seem to do the right thing.
