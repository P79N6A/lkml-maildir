Subject: [PATCH] tgafb: Remove a redundant non-mono test in mono imageblit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

 There is a test in tgafb_mono_imageblit() for a colour image with a 
fall-back to cfb_imageblit().  The test is not necessary as the only 
caller, which is tgafb_imageblit(), checks it too and only invokes this 
function for monochrome images.  It looks like a left-over from before 
some changes to tgafb_imageblit().

 Checked with checkpatch.pl and at the run time with an 8-bit TC frame
buffer on a MIPS host.
 Please apply.
