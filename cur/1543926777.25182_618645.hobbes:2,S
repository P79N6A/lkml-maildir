The taker of a mutex must also be the one that releases it.  I don't see
how you could use a mutex for this. It really requires some kind of
completion, or a compat_semaphore.

Exactly why it should be a completion or compat semaphores. The reason we
did PI on semaphores is only because they were used as mutexes before Ingo
pushed to actually get a mutex primative into the kernel. Since then,
we've been trying to remove all semaphores with either a mutex or
completion.

        down_interruptible(&dummy);
        printk("We will block now, and if you press CTRL-C from here, we get an OOPS.\n");
        down_interruptible(&dummy);
This double down is actually illegal with rt semaphores. Because we treat
semaphores as mutexes unless they are declared as compat_semaphores. In
which case we don't do PI.
Seems that you need to work out how to use a completion for your code. And
if that doesn't work, then use a compat_semaphore. But beware, that the
compat_semaphore can cause unbounded latencies. But then again, so can
completions.
