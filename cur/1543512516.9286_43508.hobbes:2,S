	Other arguments have been brought up against it (persistance, more
work in kernel memory, others).

	Dynamic /dev is important to them, as is user-notification of device
addition/removal.  This is not the same as devfs, devfs is one implementation
of this.

	No, you let some nice user-space program handle dealing with /dev for
those devices.  So long as the kernel can notify the userland program and
provide it the information it needs (Or a way to get it), this should work
nicely.

	Driver developers having to support devfs, and possibly major,minor's
as well.  The problem is, if you only go half-way you loose one of the (to me)
big advantages of devfs, getting rid of major,minor's in favor of something
(arguably) more scalable.  As in, if you have to have your drivers support both
it takes away one of devfs's advantages.  If you allow CONFIG_DEVFS=n, then you
MUST support major,minor's.

	The same can be done from userspace with appropriate kernel 
notification...
