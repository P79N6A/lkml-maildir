I also joined linux a long time ago... but the hardware pointer is not
the issue. I'm more referring to using cpublit and dragging the
scrollbar in a window... Like f.ex. Voyager.
(And, in this case, 50Mhz is the limitation not the scheduler. With 10
times that power i bet you could do it all with the cpu, just like a
common pc today.)

Eh, a 060 struggles with a mp3, it consumes most of the cpu and it can
still render a browser window (not as fast as it could originally, but
thats not my point).

AmigaOS is lowlatency but not realtime. And, with executive you run a
unix scheduler (feedback).

Hummm, Last time i played a mp3 on my amiga i kinda decoded it in the
delfina dsp =)

Heh, what cpu?
But a task raising it's cpu on it's own can be a pain since it could
dominate the machine on non executive running machines.

Executive implements dynamic priorities in a fixed priority OS, ie nice.
You select the range it should use to catch processes and where it
should place em. And, Executive is still great even though i haven't
used it for quite some time.

Hummm, input.device would never consume so much cpu that it would need
to be penalized.

Give priority to "front most" program is in Windows and OS/2. I disabled
it in OS/2 Warp something on a p120 and watched it crawl =P.
