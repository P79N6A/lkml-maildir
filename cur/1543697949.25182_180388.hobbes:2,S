Sorry, bad example.  Hmm, from a glance around, it seems that all of
the places which use strncpy() implicitly zero the buffer prior to
using strncpy().
This means that the x86 strncpy is doing unnecessary zeroing.  I do
remember Alan complaining about the last set of strlcpy() stuff
introducing information leaks - maybe those got fixed though.
Ok, I don't know where the kernel stands on this issue anymore.
Can someone definitively provide a statement of exactly what the
kernel expects of strncpy() ?
