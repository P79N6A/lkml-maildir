Now this is problem that can definately be taken care of by Disk Manager.
First of all create a boot floppy and backup boot floppy by dumping a kernel
onto a floppy (dd if=/vmlinuz of=/dev/fd0).  Hopefully, for you, your HD
manufacturer will have a freely available copy available for download on
their web site.  Get it, put it on a bootable floppy and follow the
instructions to install.  Most importantly, since you have a live partition,
choose the UPGRADE option; this will ensure that your current partitions are
preserved.  Note: DO NOT choose express install as this will repartition
your drive.  Disk Manager will tell you the geometry and the tranlated
geometry during the upgrade process; you may need the translated geometry to
get lilo to install correctly as you may have created you partitions using
the non-translated greometry.  Linux switches to the geometry specified in
the partition table during its bootup.  After you restart your computer DM
will give you a prompt to allow you to boot from a floppy; choose it and
boot off the boot floppy.  After your first bootup run fdisk and check the
geometry, if it matches DM's then you should be ok; just remove any cyl head
or sec options from /etc/lilo.conf and rerun the lilo command.  Also make
sure that lilo is installed on the boot partition not the MBR (DM is there);
something like /dev/hda1 instead of /dev/hda.  After this Linux should boot
up by itself and you can say bye, bye to the DOS partition.  If your
geometry in fdisk does not match the DM geometry (the DM geometry may be off
by one less cylinder; usually ok, use above method) then you will have to
specify the correct translated geometry in /etc/lilo.conf.  The correct
geometry for your drive (3200,16,63) is 800,64,63.  (The number of heads is
multiplied by the same power of two number that divided the number of
cylinders to a number below 1024, while the new number heads does not pass
254; that uses a different sceme with 15).  If you had to use the second
option then, with the correct translated geometry in /etc/lilo.conf, you
should be able to boot Linux after running the lilo command.  Remember not
to install lilo to the MBR.
