Here is Nicks view about active_load_balance()

imbalance will be always < busiest_load_per_task and
max_load - this_load will be < 2 * busiest_load_per_task...
and pwr_move will be <= pwr_now...

how? in this case also...
imbalance will be always < busiest_load_per_task and
max_load - this_load will be < 2 * busiest_load_per_task...
and pwr_move will be <= pwr_now...

I agree with the issue that we are trying to fix here.. but I feel
it is incomplete.. With the current code in mainline, anyone can say the 
behavior by going through the code.... with smpnice code, code is complex
and really doesn't achieve what that patch really wants to fix..

do we then really need smpnice complexity?
