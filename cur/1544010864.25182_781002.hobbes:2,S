and/or you use properly implemented crypto code (see Bruce Schneider's
books). The timing "problem" isn't really SMT specific. If you have
improperly implemented crypto (eg crypto code where the code paths and
not just the data payload are key dependent) then on any system with
more than one (logical) processor there is interference that an
attacker can use.
The only possible answer is to use proper implementation; turning off HT
may make you feel good but you go from shoddy crypto for which there is
some internet papers on how to crack it, to shoddy crypto for which the
same papers apply ;)
