The PCI bus runs at 33mhz on modern motherboards. Only motherboards made 
to provide "odd" FSB timings (such at 75, 83 mhz) need change this. 
Although your FSB (also known as memory bus) runs at 100, 133 or faster, 
the PCI bus is still running at 33mhz.
The short?
Don't worry about that warning, it's not really a warning :)
