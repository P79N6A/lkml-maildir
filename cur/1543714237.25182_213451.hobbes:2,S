Hi,
Anybody.........could you help me.
Steps followed.
1. insmod module.o              // inserting module
2. iwconfig eth1 essid <access point>  // associating with AP
3. iwconfig eth1 frag 512               // setting fragmentation
4. ping <ip of access point> -s 700
The problem here is ..............when I ping to that AP with packect size
more that Frag value,69 packets it will send then it will hang.
How to overcome this
