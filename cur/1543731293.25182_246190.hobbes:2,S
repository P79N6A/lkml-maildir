The problems are not new. The driver stuff has been outsourced to /sysfs
in the meantime, though, and the information that is being added to
/proc these days is usually human-readable and a pain to parse.

Agreed. That has been my initial motivation. Speed is a bonus.

Nothing worth mentioning. I have nothing in /proc space to compare
to. I was hoping someone would suggest a /proc based benchmark.

It doesn't fundamentally change the complexity, but I expect the
reduction in overhead to be noticeable, mostly due to:
- no more string parsing.
- fewer system calls.
- fewer cycles wasted on calculating unnecessary data fields.
