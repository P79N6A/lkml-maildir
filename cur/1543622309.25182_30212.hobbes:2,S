Alan you are of course right. But what to do about VLB and friends?
Unfortunately there isn't something comparable to struct pci_bus for
them in the kernel. (Or I'm missing something here?).
Iff then I would rather like to have a generic solution.
(Do you remmeber about 4 years ago there *was* already a lengthy
discussion about bus speed detection, without any proper resolution at
all...I remember myself having even provided some code for this
purpose...which was basicually just measuring RAM transfer rates...)
