Hello!
Attached is a patch motivated at removing extraneous includes of fs.h and
others from sched.h.  This makes a noticable difference in compile time
(it's 15-20 seconds less on my box cut down from ~2:55 to ~2:38).  I've
fixed what I caught through a somewhat expanded config, but there are
still other archs and configs that need to be tested.  Sorry about the
mime/gzip'd attachment, but otherwise it's around 47K.
