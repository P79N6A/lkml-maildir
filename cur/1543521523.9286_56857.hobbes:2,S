This is my point.
To plan that (probably someone else) will perform a critical
fix in 25 years is ludicrous.  The fix needs to be performed ASAP, 
so that userspace developers with broken code will have to
fix it NOW, not in 25-30 years.
Current systems have the processor power to spare, and if broken code is
allowed to accumulate it will.
Note that changing time_t will have NO IMPACT on currently installed
systems, it will have an effect only on upgrades. So if someone is
dependent on broken code and can't get it fixed, they just run a dist
from before the update.  The old code doesn't magicly disappear just
because Linus issues a patch...
