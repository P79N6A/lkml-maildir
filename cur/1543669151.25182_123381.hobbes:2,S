There is no syscall.  The people who don't want to use /proc for
security reasons better come up with fixes to make it acceptable.  The
kernel lacks a number of syscalls which allow getting various pieces of
information and the only way to implement the functionality is via
/proc.  The use of /proc is growing and you'll find that more than just
fexecve() will fail if you don't have /proc.
