This second paragraph is distressingly indecisive.  How much thought has
gone into this??
For a start, it seems wrong for the kernel to hardwire knowledge about UID
0 in this fashion.
I'd have thought that a better model for user-namespace unsharing would be
to do a copy-by-value of the entire namespace, then permit a
suitably-privileged application to go through and kill off any unwanted
users from the now-unshared user namespace.
Or maybe just remove that "Insert new root user" altogether?  What would
then go wrong?
