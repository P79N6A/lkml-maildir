Well, we have had various special-cases for /dev/[k]mem to try to make it 
work even with 32-bit lseek in the past (or with 64-bit lseek on archs 
that need the high bit set). So I wouldn't say "shouldn't have" - I'd love 
it if it worked, but my ove for it working is somewhat tempered by the 
need for it not screwing up everything else in the kernel ;)
Now, it's entirely possible that we shoul djust make "sys_lseek()" work
differently: right now it _always_ sign-extends its offset from "off_t" to
"loff_t", but the thing is, for a SEEK_SET, it probably makes more sense
to zero-extend it (since a negative SEEK_SET just doesn't make any sense).
So a hacky alternative might be something like the appended, but I have to 
admit that it's pretty damn hacky even if it makes sense at some level..
Oh, btw, this will cause it to still return EOVERFLOW, you'd need to also 
change that error return logic.
