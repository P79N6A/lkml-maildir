Please try not to use attachments: it makes it more difficult
to review and comment on code (so I'll paste it here).
+	/* We don't to load the module if it's already loaded */
+	spin_lock_irqsave(&modlist_lock, flags);
+	if (is_loaded(module_name)) {
+		return -EEXIST;
+	}

Need to do spin_unlock_irqrestore() even if is_loaded() is true.
+/* Test if a module is loaded : must hold module_mutex */
+int is_loaded(const char *module_name);
+{
+	struct module *mod = find_module(module_name);
+
+	if (!mod) {
+		return 1;
+	}
Don't use braces when not needed.
Why not make this function inline and put it into a header file?
