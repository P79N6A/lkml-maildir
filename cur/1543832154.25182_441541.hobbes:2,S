We applied the above TAKE to linux-2.6.17.1 and tested it.
However, we confirm the case that i_state of the inode was changed
when the inode was freed in xfs filesystem.
We think that the TAKE reduces the occurrence only.
And we think that our patch fixes the problem.
Could you review our patch again?
