Hmm, strange, I did bet that this would have solved the problem, as the 
code is for sure bogus and could be causing these kinds of problems (I 
have already scheduled it for removal in the HID tree as an upstream fix) 
- it could zero out even the bits which are used and have been previously 
set.
I would think that reverting the two commits I have mentioned is not going 
to help, if this did not help, but it's always worth trying.
Otherwise, would you care to bisect?
What is the keyboard in question, please? (vendor/product ids).
Thanks,
