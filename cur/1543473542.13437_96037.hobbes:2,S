This does not help for pgcc, gcc 2.8 and other variants the kernel
might encounter.

-mpentium is -mcpu=pentium and as such is included in -march=pentium,
so -march=pentium would suffice. You would need to switch from -O2 to
-O6, too (see pgcc FAQ at 
http://www.goof.com/pcg/
) 
There has already been such discussion in a different thread a couple
of weeks ago, please check it. Search for messages which contain
	[PATCH] Support new egcs/pgcc -mpentium(pro) options
in their subject.
I am currently considering a solution which comprises 
a) automatic configuration 
	to take the load out of the configuration menues (sp?) shown to the
	user
b) manual configuration
	e. g. for compiling a K5 kernel on a Pentium-II machine
c) automatic compiler detection
	to prevent enabling these options with plain gcc-2.7
d) other CPUs
	such as Cyrix, AMD K6
