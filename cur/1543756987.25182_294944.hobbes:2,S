I was taking the whole shebang in order to differentiate between
PMSG_FREEZE and PMSG_SUSPEND - they're currently typedef'd to the
same thing (3), so drivers such as ide-disk can't decide whether or
not they need to spin down for the atomic copy or for powering off.
(Otherwise you'll find the HDD spinning down and up mid-suspend).
I believe vanilla swsusp passed "3" as the power state hence the HDD
spun down and up anyway, so there were no regressions there, just
bugs. Software Suspend 2 passed "4" as the power state which
ide-disk.c treated as "flush caches, but don't spin down". This is
what broke when the new typedefs went in, but would be fixed when
they're complete (whole shebang).
Bernard.
