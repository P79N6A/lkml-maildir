Judging by the
	request_module: runaway loop modprobe binfmt-0000
one or more of the hardlinked binaries (modprobe being one, but not 
necessarily the one that initially triggers hits) will read all zeroes-
Or at least bytes at offsets 2 and 3 will read as zero, causing it to not 
be recognized as a proper binary, causing that "binfmt-0000" thing.
