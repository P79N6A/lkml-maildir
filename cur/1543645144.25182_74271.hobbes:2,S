I'm running 2.4.18 vanilla with swsusp patches.  I've disabled GPM
and suspend/resume works well.
However, occasionally when my laptop resumes everything appears ok,
but the keyboard and mouse (touchpad) don't respond.   If I ssh
in via the ethernet I can kill X and keyboard control comes back.
(this is the same behavior I saw with GPM was missing things up)
(I've actually removed the gpm executable from my machine)
I use the 'susp' script to suspend the machine which knocks out most
of the known problems with software suspend.
I'm running XFree86 4.2.1.
My laptop is a Sony VAIO FXA32 w/Duron 900MHz and 384MB RAM.
You can have a look at the susp script at

Any ideas?
