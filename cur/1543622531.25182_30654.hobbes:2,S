It is not practical and it was absorbed via distos which are/were
generally paranoid of DMA because of the total number of ATAPI devices
that live in SFF-8020/8070 but claim ATA/ATAPI-4 so who knows or cares.
The real solution for distros is to wrapper the dma_capable flags in the
module cores in 2.4 under the disk_only.  Also not setting
CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO will help but you are not permitted to invoke
echo using_dma:1 > /proc/ide/hda/settings
One of the issues to be address is a test for transfer modes, but have to
many other issues to address w/ clients to deal with distro issues.
