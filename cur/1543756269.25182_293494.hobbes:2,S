Is that with -rc1 or -rc2?
Anyway, I think Inspiron 8600 has an ALPS touchpad and externded
support for it just went in in -rc2. I think if you boot with
psmouse.proto=exps you will get your mouse back (if your psmouse is
compiled as a module you'll need to add 'options psmouse proto=exps'
to your /etc/modprobe.conf).
Nonetheless it would be nice to see the data stream from the touchpad
to see why our ALPS support does not work quite right. Could you
please try booting with "log_buf_len=131072 i8042.debug=1", and
working the touchpad a bit. then send me the output of "dmesg -s
131072" (or just /var/log/messages).
Thanks!

P.S. I am CC-ing Peter Osterlund since he works on Synaptics/ALPS
driver as well.
