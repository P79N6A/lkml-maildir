Our team has done this twice aready for Linux (one TOE in software one as an 
ASIC).  It can be hard to make decisions on tradeoffs when the general 
consinsus in Linux is to not support TOE.  I'm sure that once everything is 
said and done we will provide a driver for our TOE to the community.  
Support from other OS venders has been better and feedback from them will 
defenitly influance our hardware design.
