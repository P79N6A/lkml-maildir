Depends on the axis in your graph. The benchmarks I am using are not
balancing on the verge of going bad, if that's what you mean. They
cut deep (30 to 100 MB) into swap through most of their run time,
and there's quite a bit of swap turnover with compiling stuff.
I also completed a best effort attempt at determining the impact of
any differences between mem= and actual RAM removal. I had to adapt
the kbuild benchmark somewhat to the available hardware. I benchmarked
with 48 MB RAM at mem=16M and again after removing 32MB of RAM. If there
was a difference in performance, it was very small for both 2.4.23 and
2.6.0-test11, with the latter taking over 2.5 times as long to complete
the benchmark.
