    By now, to fully switch to utf-8, I only need to have áéíóúñ and
their uppercase counterparts (for people who cannot see the chars, they
are the acute accented vowels and the ntilde). I really hope that, in
the future, there are a way of fully use Unicode (and I mean the entire
range) using framebuffer in console (there probably is an emulator for
that job already, I have to check), but for the time being that's
enough.
    I really don't mind if I have to use an userspace program to have
unicode support on the console (the kernel shouldn't mess with
encodings, or have utf-8 only; I don't know the current status, that's
why I asked), but if the kernel does directly the job in the console
driver, that's not bad either.
