(I hadn't noticed the call to i8042_check_mux inside the if statement
condition after the loop, doh!)
> Can you try this one please?
Yes, this time it did this loop 4 times:
     for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
	 DB();
		i8042_init_mux_values(i8042_mux_values + i, i8042_mux_port + i, i);
  }
And then I got one more at 590, inside i8042_check_mux:
    DB();
    if (request_irq(values->irq, i8042_interrupt, SA_SHIRQ,
						  "i8042", i8042_request_irq_cookie))
                return -1;
		DB();
This last one did not show up, nor did any inside the conditional loops at
line 878 or 883, nor at line 888.  So perhaps it was in request_irq that it
locked up?
I'll be away from this machine for the day, although I can try something
new this evening.
Take care,
     Dale
