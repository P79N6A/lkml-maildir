bum. sorry. I wasn't clear. That's not what I meant. I meant that any program
which _depends_ on a bug deserves to break, and anybody who thinks otherwise is
nuts. Good software works _around_ bugs, it doesn't use them. When u fix the
bug, the software doesn't break. Whole point of being open: you know what the
guys meant to do, even if they didn't do it right.
