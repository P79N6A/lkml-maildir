I don't see how linmodem drivers apply.  At least not at the low-level
because you actually have to driver the hardware, respond to interrupts
etc.  On some of this I can see a driver split like there is for the video
card drivers, so the long running portitions don't have to be in the kernel.
I actually don't see what devices could be done in user space with
this context except possibly forwarding device calls across the
network.
