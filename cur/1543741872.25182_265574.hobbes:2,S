The scheme hch suggested is highly invasive in the area of architecture-
specific fixmap layout and introduces a dependency of fixmap layout on
maximum segment size, which may make it current normal maximum segment
sizes use prohibitive amounts of vmallocspace on 32-bit architectures.
So I'd drop that suggestion, though it's not particularly farfetched.
