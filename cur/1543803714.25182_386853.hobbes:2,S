To follow up on this, it appears that things are getting stuck while  
reading /proc/*/maps, specifically it hangs in fs/proc/task_mmu.c in  
m_start() at down_read(&mm->mmap_sem). The same thing happens when  
trying to readlink /proc/*/exe.
I'm really not sure why this lock is getting stuck. Can anyone  
reproduce this?
