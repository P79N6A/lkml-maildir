Hi Michael,

It's caching *one* value, not one value per polling app  (i.e., opened file).
Also, if querying the hardware is very cheap, the driver is at freedom
to do that instead of caching.

The timeouts bookkeeping will normally be done by some infrastructure,
and can often be (in principle) be optimized to less than on value per
app. Also, it's just one timestamp. By contrast, what you're asking
for requires explicit handling by every driver, and the attribute
value may take significant amount of storage -- per app.

The app can do this itself by polling and checking the value, with a
(not too) small value of dupeq.min_wait. In the case of a
polling-based data source, the resulting hardware queries and timer
interrupts are exactly the same as an in-kernel implementation which
does the polling and comparions itself. If the data source is
event-based then the comparison in userspace does have a drawback: the
comparions are done just dupeq.min_wait apart even if the event rate
happens to be higher. Can you think of a case where this matters?
