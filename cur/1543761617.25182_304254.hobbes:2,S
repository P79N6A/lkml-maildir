the problem is there also, it just doesn't show up. 2.6 checks for
every interrupt if one of the handlers took care of it. if not the
dump is printed and a counter is increased. if this counter reaches
a limit the interrupt line is disabled. 2.4 doesn't do it so the interrupt
storm is there too, it just recovers...you can try with 2.4...after you
have the card up do a "cat /proc/interrupts" and you'll see a high
number for yenta's interrupt line...

[snip /proc/iomem]
it was just to be sure nothing is mapped over existing physical RAM
which is not the case...
i'll cook up a more flexible patch which handles other TI bridges
as well (the current one will fail on some older controllers and
on 2-slot controllers)
