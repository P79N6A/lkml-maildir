It's just one of the many things I don't understand about graphics.  
If I look at those png's locally (with gimp or gqview) they have a
dark grey checkerboard background.  If I look at them on the web (with
galeon), the background is white.  Go figure.  Maybe the file has no
background?  I dunno.

I was misreading the x-axis.  They're actually every 20 sec.  My
system isn't doing that.

The scheduler seems to be working great.  
You're really getting hammered with those periodic 6 msec delays,
though.  The basic audio cycle is only 1.45 msec.
