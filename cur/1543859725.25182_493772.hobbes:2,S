i have released the 2.6.20-rc1-rt3 tree, which can be downloaded from 
the usual place:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
more info about the -rt patchset can be found on the RT wiki:
  
http://rt.wiki.kernel.org
this is a rebase of -rt to v2.6.20, plus lots of fixes all around the 
place. Given that v2.6.20 is a stabilization release, i rebased the -rt 
tree earlier than usual, and it has worked out so far and is converging 
pretty fast. Changes since 2.6.19-rt6:
 - scheduling latency fixes on SMP systems
 - various high-res timers and dynticks fixes
 - all hardirq and softirq threads now default to SCHED_FIFO:50, use 
   rtirq, set_kthread_prio or raw chrt to tune them. Note: the naming of 
   IRQ threads has changed to "IRQ-123", from the "IRQ 123" naming, to 
   make it easier to script them.
 - NUMA/slab-rt fixes
 - tracer fixes
 - merge the latest ARM patches
 - lockless pagecache patchset from Nick Pigging, ported to -rt by Peter
   Zijlstra
 - files_lock scalability patchset from Peter Zijlstra
 - more /proc/lockdep dependency info from Jason Baron
 - latest lockdep fixes
 - latest e1000 fixes
 - /proc/timer_list for timer info and enhanced /proc/timer_stats 
   support via CONFIG_TIMER_STATS.
 - fixed bzImage boot hang when FUNCTION_TRACING/mcount enabled.
 - lots of other fixes i forgot about :)
 - merge to v2.6.20-rc1
 - merge to latest -git after v2.6.20-rc1
to build a 2.6.20-rc1-rt3 tree, the following patches should be applied:
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.19.tar.bz2
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.20-rc1.bz2
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/patch-2.6.20-rc1-rt3
the -rt YUM repository for Fedora Core 6 and 5, for architectures x86_64 
and i686 can be activated via:
   cd /etc/yum.repos.d
   wget 
http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/rt.repo
   yum install kernel-rt.x86_64   # on x86_64
   yum install kernel-rt          # on i686
   yum update kernel-rt           # refresh - or enable yum-updatesd
(note: it will take 15-30 minutes from now on for the yum repository to 
be updated to -rt6)
as usual, bugreports, fixes and suggestions are welcome,
	Ingo
