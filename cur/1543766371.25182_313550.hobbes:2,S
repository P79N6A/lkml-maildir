I'm not really using the git-pasky part of git yet for development
(except for 'git log -c')  You can just "clone" the tree yourself with a
stupid little script like I do below.  It still uses hard-links so
common git objects are only in one place on the disk.
Feel free to make it better, I have never claimed to be a bash
programmer :)
