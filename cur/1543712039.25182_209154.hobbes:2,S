Because it is only solution I know that does not require rewriting half
the kernel or rewriting all the block drivers. (see how swsusp already
does copy of lowmem).
Having special "poll" mode for block drivers might do the trick, but thats lot of work.
Which operations are allowed to access highmem? Can I rely on
block device read/write not accessing highmem?

Thanks.
