Actually, this is a great example, because at one point I was working
on a device interface which would offload all of the disk-disk copying
overhead to the disks themselves, and not involve the CPU/RAM at all.
I seem to recall that I2O promised something along these lines as well
(i.e. direct device-device communication).
Cheers, Andreas
