I did not taalk to this host before (or if talk was done, it was a long ago)
Let me explain purposes of this somewhat weird routing:
I have 2 dialin hosts and I have dialin clients with static IP.
So I set up routing for these static IPs from one host to another
and from that another to first (I get loop this way).
When PPP client with this IP connected, route to ppp device established
and overrides default one. This was 2.0 behaviour, but under 2.2
this scheme no longer works. It does not work from start, when there was no
traffic between one of hosts and that address.
(just to add. I replaced only one 2.0 box with 2.2 kernel,
so I just see what works with 2.0 did not work with 2.2)
It was brought to my attention that route added differently in 2.0
and 2.2 (in 2.0 pppd do it, in 2.2 kernel do it),
but I think it is silly to differentiate kernel added and user added routes.

No. That was not the case

As I said it was not the case (may be it looked like this from my demonstration,
but believe me, even if no previous conversations with host A was made
route still not work.)

I cannot say for now, but I'll try as soon as I can.
Anyway it is a pity, that I cannot use somewhat previously worked with 2.0
without changes
