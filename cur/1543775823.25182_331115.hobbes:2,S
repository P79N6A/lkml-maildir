Subject: enabled udev - empty flash drive fills log with garbage

Hi,
I am running 12-mm2.  I recently enabled udev_0.060-1_amd64.deb.  It booted with full support (eg. /etc/init.d/udev
was not disabled).  However the empty sddr09 based flash drive keeps being queried - this fills the log with garbage.
How do I tell udev/kernel that an empty device is ok?  There is an entry in fstab for this: 
/dev/sda1       /mnt/sd         auto    rw,user,noauto  0       0
should it be disabled or changed?
TIA
Ed Tomlinson
