  No, they're not stuck in a `D' state.  It looks like they're hung
in poll(), which seems reasonable:

  As I recall, that is both a glibc and kernel issue (since glibc has to
make it visible to the end-app), which goes a long way towards letting
me figure out exactly where the problem crept in.  Backing down from
linux-2.2.0+mingo to -2.1.127 didn't make the problem go away, but since
my previous version of glibc was pre-poll(), I'm probably not using the
same kernel API I used to.
  If that is a DNS-only poll() problem, I could see why this might be
creeping out now.  I'm on the GNOME mailing list and I've got anti-spam
stuff turned on in sendmail.  Right now, with redhat off the net, it
can't be verified via DNS and that is causing a large backlog to build
up and hammer me.
  My other test, DHCPD, is stuck in a different area.  It is apparently
getting hung up trying to syslog data.  According to gdb, syslogd is
waiting in select() but that is where it would be anyway.
