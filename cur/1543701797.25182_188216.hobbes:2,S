There was a large thread after 2.4.10 was released about speeding up the
boot proces by reading the underlying blockdev of the root partition in
block order.
Unfortunately at the time reading the files through the pagecache would
cause a second read of the data even if it was already buffered.  I don't
remember the exact details.
Are you saying this is now resolved?  And the above optimization will work?
