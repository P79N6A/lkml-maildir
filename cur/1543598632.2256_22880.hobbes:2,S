It's an atomic allocation, the driver is supposed to be able to handle this, 
and it does since you report that the burn just runs slowly, it does not 
stop.  There is way too much in cache:

This is causing the high order allocation failures - with only a small 
fraction of memory free the chances of none of it being in contiguous, 
aligned 8 page units rises dramatically.  It's likely the kprint that is 
slowing you down, you could check this by commenting it out (page_alloc.c, 
near the end of __alloc_pages).
Do you have the same problem on 2.4.8, but not in 2.4.7?
