Good question!  It was supposed to be ASCII which, I guess is
UTF-8 or something like that. However, I find that tabs, which
were decreed to be at 8-collumn intervals end up being used
instead of spaces i.e., one-column, etc. So, if you look at
some well-patched source you sometimes see a mess.
The names of contributors often have non-ASCII characters
in them. This may not be a problem, but when using `pine`
without the 'latest-and-greatest' version, they sometimes
are unreadable.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
