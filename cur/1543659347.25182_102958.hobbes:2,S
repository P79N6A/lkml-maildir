Hi,
First let me apologize if this doesn't belong on the list, I wasn't
sure where to ask and I want to make sure this is a non-fatal error
(100% of the time).
www1 is a Dual PIII 733, 1G ram, eepro100 network card. gets around
15-35mbits of traffic.
www3 is a Dual P3 1GHZ with 1G ram, and also an eepro100 network card.
load balanced with www1, 15-35mbits of traffic.
around 5 days ago I updated to 2.4.20 (from 2.4.18) and noticed these
kernel (errors?) this morning at around the same time on each server.
Jan 13 09:12:38 www1 kernel: KERNEL: assertion (newsk->state != TCP_SYN_RECV) failed at tcp.c(2229)
Jan 13 09:12:38 www1 kernel: KERNEL: assertion ((1<<sk2->state)&(TCPF_ESTABLISHED|TCPF_CLOSE_WAIT|TCPF_CLOSE)) failed at af_inet.c(689)
Jan 13 09:08:44 www3 kernel: KERNEL: assertion (newsk->state != TCP_SYN_RECV) failed at tcp.c(2229)
Jan 13 09:08:44 www3 kernel: KERNEL: assertion ((1<<sk2->state)&(TCPF_ESTABLISHED|TCPF_CLOSE_WAIT|TCPF_CLOSE)) failed at af_inet.c(689)  
if someone could please provide insight on exactly what is happening
when this happens, it would be greatly appreciated. are there any side
effects? is this a kernel bug?
if you need more information please let me know.
Thanks,
Mike
