The function, claim, is found in prom.c uses longs. The long is the 
usual idiom for hiding a pointer, not an int, so I fixed accordingly. 
I'm open to further discussion of course.
On a 64 bit machine long and int are different sizes. This would make 
things "proper" if things changed in the future.

Correct. The preceding comment explains what is going on. Removing the 
magic numbers seemed like a good idea.
