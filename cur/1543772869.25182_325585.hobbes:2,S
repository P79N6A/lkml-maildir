It comes from the driver itself, as you point out:

Yup, that's what the pci core sets that pointer to.

drivers/pci/pci-driver.c::pci_device_probe_static() does it.  See the
latest edition of the Linux Device Drivers book for a full description
and walk-through of how a pci device get added and removed from the
driver core (it's free online if you don't want to buy it.)
