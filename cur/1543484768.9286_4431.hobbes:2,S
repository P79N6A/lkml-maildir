Yeah, that would be good. "rename()" is a real pain. It's _the_ most
complex operation, mainly because of renaming subdirectories has such a
non-local effect.

I'll give you clearance, not for 2.2.2, but you wouldn't get it done by
then anyway, so 2.2.3 would be your target. HOWEVER, I'd ask you to
actually go one step further: the VFS layer should separate the case of
renaming a subdirectory from the case of renaming a regular file.
In the end, both cases would call the same fs-specific rename() function,
but basically something like this would be what I'd want to see to make
each fs not have to worry about locking at all, the way it should be:
 - a non-directory "rename()" would _not_ get the per-fs rename lock. They
   don't need them, the per-fs lock is only used to protect against
   concurrent renames that change the topology (so that you can sanely
   avoid loops in the directory structure)
 - the directory case is different in other ways too: it needs to do the
   is_subdir() check (which should also be done on a VFS layer, as it
   these days is just a matter of following the dentry pointers), and it
   needs to look up the target dentry with the LOOKUP_SLASHOK flag.
 - the directory case would unhash the target directory in the VFS layer
   as per your race fix, and would re-hash it if the low-level rename
   returns an error.
 - the VFS layer would do the "d_move()" operation (both for directory and
   non-directories), the low-level FS would only do the actual low-level
   rename.
If we have to change rename (and all low-level filesystems) to fix the
race, let's just fix it once and for all, and separate the two rename
cases properly.
