I just browsed thorugh the changelogs at
http://linus.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/src/drivers/media/dvb?nav=index.html
|src/.|src/drivers|src/drivers/media
and back-feeded the changes that did not make it into our local CVS yet.

Thanks for your offer. But I have just cut out your patch, "reversed 
it", compile tested it and sent it to lkml.
CU
Michael.
