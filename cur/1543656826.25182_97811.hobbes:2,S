   I had sent this earlier, there is a bug in router advertisement handling code,
   where the reference (and memory) to an inet6_dev pointer can get leaked (this
   leak can happen atmost once for each interface on a system which receives
   invalid RA's). Below is the patch against 2.5.51 to fix it.
Applied, thanks.
