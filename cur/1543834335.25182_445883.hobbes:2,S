Because if they are still enabled we would end up with an BYTES_PER_WORD
alignment (which is bad, see below).

Uhm, that's the meaning of ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN, isn't it?
from mm/slab.c :
#ifndef ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN
/*
 * Enforce a minimum alignment for all caches.
 * Intended for archs that get misalignment faults even for BYTES_PER_WORD
 * aligned buffers. Includes ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN.
 * If possible: Do not enable this flag for CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB, it disables
 * some debug features.
 */
#define ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN 0
#endif

Sorry, I should have mentioned it: on s390 (32 bit) we set
#define ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN 8.
This is needed since our common I/O layer allocates data structures that need
to have an eight byte alignment. Now, if I turn on DEBUG_SLAB, nothing works
anymore, simply because the slab cache code ignores ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN and
uses an BYTES_PER_WORD alignment instead, which it shouldn't:
also from mm/slab.c :
#ifndef ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN
/*
 * Enforce a minimum alignment for the kmalloc caches.
 * Usually, the kmalloc caches are cache_line_size() aligned, except when
 * DEBUG and FORCED_DEBUG are enabled, then they are BYTES_PER_WORD aligned.
 * Some archs want to perform DMA into kmalloc caches and need a guaranteed
 * alignment larger than BYTES_PER_WORD. ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN allows that.
 * Note that this flag disables some debug features.
 */
#define ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN 0
#endif
Since that didn't work I thought why not set ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN to 8, since
that would (according to the description) guarantee that _all_ caches would
have an 8 byte alignment. But that didn't work too.
So the result is this patch, which makes DEBUG_SLAB work on s390. And actually
guarantees what the above descriptions imply (unless the patch is broken).
