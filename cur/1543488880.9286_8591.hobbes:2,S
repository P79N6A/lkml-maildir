   As Stanislav Meduna already postet, one part of the problem is in
   tcp.c cleanup_rbuf():
    if((copied >= rcv_window_now) &&
       ((rcv_window_now + tp->mss_cache) <= tp->window_clamp))
	    tcp_read_wakeup(sk);
I'm embarrased, what a stupid bug.  Good spotting.
I was trying to avoid the calculation of the new window when possible
because I knew the window selection path often had some multiples in
it, crap.
Please try this patch:
