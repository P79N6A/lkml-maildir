I'll assume you want to use lilo?
Read the Bootdisk HOWTO in /usr/doc/HOWTO/Bootdisk-HOWTO. Read
/usr/doc/lilo-0.21/doc/*.

You need initrd iff your kernel image is too large, generally because
of included drivers, SCSI being the most often reason in my
experience. Initrd is used in a two stage boot for this case. I
generally don't need an initrd.

00:00 is the major/minor numbers that the loader is trying to access. 
They are obviously wrong.  You will see 02:1c for fd0H1440, for
example.  This indicates that neither rdev or lilo has been used to
install this information into the MBR.
