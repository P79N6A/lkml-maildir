Subject: [PATCH 22/22] [PATCH] ptrace_attach: fix possible deadlock schenario with irqs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/17/259

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
Eric Biederman points out that we can't take the task_lock while holding
tasklist_lock for writing, because another CPU that holds the task lock
might take an interrupt that then tries to take tasklist_lock for writing.
Which would be a nasty deadlock, with one CPU spinning forever in an
interrupt handler (although admittedly you need to really work at
triggering it ;)
Since the ptrace_attach() code is special and very unusual, just make it
be extra careful, and use trylock+repeat to avoid the possible deadlock.
