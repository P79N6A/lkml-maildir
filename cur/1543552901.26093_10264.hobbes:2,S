On friday I bought a power supply with 431 watts, updated the BIOS to the
latest versions, put a fan on the BX chip like described on www.bp6.com,
screwed two high performance fans on the top of the non-overclocked
celerons (what a waste :) ) and set the voltage to 2.1 volts (tested 2.0,
too). No improvement in stability: after a few seconds bonnie crashes the
machine when used on hde4 or hdg4. Today I replaced the cables to enforce
UDMA 33 instead of UDMA 66 on hde and hdg. No problems so far. I can start
20 parallel bonnie's on the disks without any errors. This is an
acceptable fix for me, because the raid5-array would be limited by UDMA33
on hda and hdc anyways.
Regarding the APIC messages... I see no rule when they occur. I believe
they were gone when using the better power supply, but perhaps I just
didn't tested long enough before I returned this expensive box...
