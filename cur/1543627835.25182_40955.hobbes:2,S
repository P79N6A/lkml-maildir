1) This patch doesn't change anything except to document which fields
   are present, and how big they are, and no there isn't enough room
   to trivially expand these fields.
2) Exporting kdev_t from the kernel would be very bad.
3) swapdev is long dead, and root_dev while it works is unnecessary,
   you can specify it on the command line just fine.
So we already are future proofed, and the change you suggest would be
a bad one.  The compiled in command line fully supports the ability
to set your root device, so no functionality is lost.
Like I said in my intro a lot of this code simply makes what the boot
processes is currently doing more visible.
