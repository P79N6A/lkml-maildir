the straight forward approach was to have N (currently nine?)
different 'spaces' all referenced by a task, and the latest
idea to optimize that (Andi made that some requirement IIRC)
was to have one structure referenced by the task struct, 
which holds the references to those 'spaces'

we (Linux-VServer) basically consider the various 'spaces'
building blocks (or smallest units) to build larger 
environments which are isolated or virtualized in some
aspects, but not all of them.
think of it as: chroot(), chnamespace, chcontext, chbind, ...
existing examples (just to get the idea) are:
 - cooperating applications which are limited to a subset
   of the available network addresses
 - strictly isolated (pid and resources) services on the
   same filesystem and network
