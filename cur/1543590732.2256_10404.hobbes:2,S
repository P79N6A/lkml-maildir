Which no one single piece of common code is using yet in 2.4.5pre1 so
right now (2.4.5pre1) you must be doing the mainteinance yourself the
old way.
But I certainly agree that it is promising and that in the future
de-localizing the 32bit wrappers is a good thing so at least people will
see this code when they break it while changing the common code ;).

Nice to hear that, when you do that please keep patches@x86-64.org in
CC so we follow it.
After we change the wrapper mechanism by avoiding the mainteinance work by
de-localizing the wrappers and after we share the wrapper logic as well, it
will be a _real_ pleasure to support the lvm ioctl from 32bit userland on
x86-64 too indeed and then it will be a worthwhile effort to support
those ioctl.
Thanks,
Andrea
