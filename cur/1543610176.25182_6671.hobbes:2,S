>>and BTW what is an "?entity?" ?
Oops. Excuse my ambiguity. When I said "entity" I was describing the design in
a very general form. Let me phrase it like this; my software in theory looks
like:
- a manager "entity" is responsible for destroying and creating "worker"
threads.
- the worker threads then perform a specific tasks.
That's theory though. The implementation actually looks like:
A linux kernel thread has the responsibility of creating and killing threads
(thus 
termed "manager").
The worker threads (also kernel threads) perform specific tasks.
>>2.4.3 is awfully stale for starters -
Yup. This is not by choice :-) The hardware/OS is pretty much fixed at this
point.
Would spawning a kernel thread from a kernel thread work with a recent kernel?
