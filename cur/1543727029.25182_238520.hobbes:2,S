Hi, 
Here goes the fifth release candidate of kernel v2.4.27.
It includes a handful of XFS fixes, a network update (Bluetooth, Netfilter, 
bridge), it revert problematic DVD-RW support for now (should be back in 
2.4.28).
Most importantly this release fixes an exploitable race in file offset handling 
which allows unpriviledged users from potentially reading kernel memory.
This touches several drivers and generic proc code. This issue is covered by 
CAN-2004-0415.
Vendors should be releasing their updates real soon now. 
Here are the most important security issues fixed by the 2.4.27 release:
CAN-2004-0495 (Al Viro sparse fixes)
CAN-2004-0497 (users could modify group ID of arbitrary files on the system)
CAN-2004-0535 (e1000 minor info leak)
CAN-2004-0685 (backported Conectiva usb sparse fixes)
CAN-2004-0415 (file offset pointer handling race)
CAN-2004-0565 (information leak ia64)
-final should be out in a few days if nothing bad shows up. 
For more details please read the detailed changelog.
