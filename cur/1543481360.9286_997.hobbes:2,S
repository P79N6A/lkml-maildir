Ah, I see... is there any way for the ps/top/etc. utilities to get at the
HZ rate so this behaviour can be fixed?

Yeah, this makes sense, definitely.  I suppose a ps binary could try to
work out the jiffy rate from that, but it'd be inaccurate at best (mine at
1000 returns 1013 interrupts).
I guess I can just deal with it and remember to divide by 10.
