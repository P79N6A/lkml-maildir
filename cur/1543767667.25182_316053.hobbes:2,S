Those two clis seems unrelated, so I don't see why I should mix them in
the same patch. I couldn't trigger the other problems, only the one with
rdi corruption.
Note that those clis seems superflous, cli is only needed before swapgs,
so adding cli before swapgs in retint_swapgs sounds a better idea than
to keep irq off for a longer time for no apparent good reason. But I've
no real idea why those cli are needed so I guess I must be missing
something. there's no commentary attached to your patch that can exlain
why the cli are needed _way_ before calling swapgs.
