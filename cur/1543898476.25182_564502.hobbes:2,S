The problem is that when you run pktsetup, the driver will open the cdrom 
device and keep it open. A very long time ago, the driver didn't do that, 
but that caused other problems, see for example:
 	
http://herbie.ucs.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0407.0/0761.html
I don't know how to fix these problems in the kernel, but I know that an 
old idea from Jens Axboe was to merge pktsetup and mount in user space so 
that pktsetup only needs to run when you are actually going to use packet 
writing.
