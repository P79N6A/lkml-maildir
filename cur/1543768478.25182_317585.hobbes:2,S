Hi ,
 I want to know that wheather RPC over "portals by sandia labs" are
there or not.
 As lustre ptlrpc is  lustre filesystem specific which includes obd
device etc. which
 i supposed are redundant. Like sunrpc package comes with linux kernel.
 Is such rpc package over portals is already there ? 
 If RPC over portals are not there is there any reason for not having that?
 I google it enough i did'n't get  any link.
Thanks,
Prasanna.
