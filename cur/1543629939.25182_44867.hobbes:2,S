hmm.

I've been testing 2.5.14 pretty hard for a couple of days.
ext2, ext3-ordered, ext3-writeback (all with small blocks) are solid.
reiserfs and vfat are solid.
JFS deadlocks (see the BUGBUG comment in jfs_txnmgr.c - it happens).  I've
asked the JFS guys for help on this; possibly the code can just be removed:
the buffer-based writeout which I replaced wouldn't have written the
pages anyway...
ext3-journalled is not happy.
There's a locking bug between try_to_free_buffers and buffer_insert_inode_queue
which never seems to trigger.  I've got that fixed.
There's a known race between unmount and writeback which is probably
impossible to trigger.  (see the FIXME at __sync_list).  Testing the
fix for that at present.
The "sync" functions aren't right.  Pages which are both dirty and
under writeback are not correctly waited upon.  This is a minor
correctness thing which nobody would notice.  Still thinking
about the best way to close this.
So unless you're a JFS or ext3-journalled user, 2.5.14 is OK.

04 60 -> line 1120.  Yup, I get that one too.  I assume you were
testing with data=journal.
Thanks again...
