The www.linuxadvocacy.org FQDN is taken from the 'org' address
space and it is my understanding that '.org' names are for
_non_profit_ organizations. Clearly, someone who uses this
FQDN to redirect you to 'datahelpers.com' is doing so to increase
their company's profits.
I don't know the correct contact with the domain name registry
folks but perhaps we can point out this abuse of a domain name.
At a minimum, datahelpers should be admonished to not use the
name as a shortcut to their website and, perhaps, the name
could be stripped from datahelpers.com.
