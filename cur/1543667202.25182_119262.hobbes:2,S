My plan is to rip out UNIX98 pty handling copletly out of devfs instead.
We already have a lean, small filesystem exactly for that purpose and
it adds lots of unessecary cruft to devfs (DEVFS_FL_CURRENT_OWNER and
DEVFS_FL_WAIT to be exact).  Afterwards devfs would only create /dev/pts/
(and /dev/pty/ as devfs renamed it IIRC) and devfs users would have to
mount devpts aswell.
