Well, me for one.  (I don't use BK, but I also don't complain about it. 
;) )  The reason I don't use it, is I've been playing around in the SCM 
space as an interesting diversion/exploration/mental-exercise, and I 
don't want to violate your license.  (Letter or spirit.)
But I've been happy using the offical release tarballs and -rmk patches, 
so I don't count from a business view. :)

If (as I understand the above to imply[1]) the daemon responding to 
requests runs BK locally, then those who can't run BK can't run the 
daemon, and so the above doesn't actually solve their problem.  (They 
would have to find someone willing to accept the license to run the 
daemon and test it during development, and there are no guarrantees there.)
Anyway, I'm just adding noise... I'm happy using the tarballs, etc., and 
I'm glad you've improved Linus's development life.
C-ya,
Eli
[1]  If you are saying that daemon talks the BK protocol, then my point 
no longer stands.
