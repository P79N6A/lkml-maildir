Sure. It was painfully simple. The swap tendency worked basically the 
same but did not take into account distress. ie It made the "swappiness" 
knob purely dependant on mapped ratio. For whatever reason, if the 
swappiness value is the same in later kernels but swaps more, there is 
more "distress" meaning we are priority scanning much more aggressively.
