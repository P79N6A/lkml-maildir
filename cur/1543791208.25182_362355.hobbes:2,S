So you're saying your hardware doesn't act consistently.
Is there a BIOS update you can try?  The failure sure seems
to be board-specific.

Well that's news, and not mentioned in the bug report; in fact, you
said explicitly that it _never_ worked on earlier kernels (see your
comment #2).
This means you could use "git bisect" to point a finger at a patch that,
if it doesn't actually cause the problem, at least surfaces a latent bug
in other code.  Could you please try that?
I'm starting to suspect some IRQ setup problem here; those are classically
issues in ACPI code, even when the breakage shows only with USB.
