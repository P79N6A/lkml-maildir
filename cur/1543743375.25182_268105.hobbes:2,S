This isn't very useful without information about proximity domains.
e.g. on x86-64 the proximity domain number is not necessarily 
the same as the node number.

Also some reporting of _PXM for PCI devices is needed. I had a 
experimental patch for this on x86-64 (not ACPI based), that
reported nearby nodes for PCI busses.

Surely distance from 0 to 0 is 0?

I would prefer that.
