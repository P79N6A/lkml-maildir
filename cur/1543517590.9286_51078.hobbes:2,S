in asm1.c
int i = 1 ;
__asm__  volatile ( "
                movl  %0, %%eax\n
                addl  $1, %%eax\n
                movl  %%eax,  %0\n"
                :  :"g"(i) : "eax"
) ;
gcc -O -S asm1.c.
output asm code:
...
#APP
movl  $1, %eax
addl  $1, %eax
movl %eax, $1
#NO_APP
...
Neigher the asm1.c or asm1.s can't assembled to a executable file.
But it can compiled by "gcc asm1.c"
How does the gcc optimize programe with "g"(i) ?????
