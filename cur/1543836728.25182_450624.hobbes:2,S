I think that if we have the date, the name, and Gmail has the logs, it
should be enough to get back to the real persons in case of future legal
trouble. Anyway, it's clearly possible that many contributors already
post under pseudonyms which do not designate them in person. After all,
it is already more or less the case for all those with non-latin alphabets.
Perhaps the only thing we're missing is a list of validated mail account
providers ? Anyway, how do we now that someone hosted by local provider X
my be mapped to a physical person ?
Maybe we should only make the difference between "intentionnal anonymity"
and free mail accounts, if this is possible.

Willy
