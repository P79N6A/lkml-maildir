So we want to change the definition of ZONE_DMA to refer to the first 16MB 
only? ZONE_DMA32 is always a 4GB border? (Andy disagrees about DMA32 see 
his message!).
It seems to me that DMA can be run on ZONE_NORMAL. ZONE_DMAxx is used for 
situations in which DMA cannot be done to all of memory. ZONE_DMA allows 
an architecture to define a single exception zone that ends at 
MAX_DMA_ADDRESS (which is arch specific).
