Unfortunately, we are living in an economic system with the strong 
tendency to create oligopolys.
Situations with only 1-3 manufacturers you can choose from are quite 
common (consider e.g. the 3D graphics market).
If you aren't a big company with big market power but a simple costumer 
who needs such hardware you have zero choice if all manufactorers only 
offer binary-only drivers at best.
And there's also the common misconception all costumers had enough 
information when buying something. If you are a normal Linux user and 
buy some hardware labelled "runs under Linux", it could turn out that's 
with a Windows driver running under ndiswrapper...
