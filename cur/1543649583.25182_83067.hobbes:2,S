I have successfully compiled the latest Nvidia driver with kernel 
2.5.44 on a heavily modified RH 7.2 (original compiler) box  after 
applying the patch posted to this list previously. However it 
can't be loaded because insmod bombs out saying that, IIRC, 
create_workqueue, flush_workqueue, and a couple of other similar 
symbols are unresolved.
nm vmlinux shows that these symbols exist and this is (obviously) 
reflected in the System.map. However, the proc interface doesn't 
show them. I use modutils-2.4.6.
I'm not familiar with the internals but IMHO, this may be a 
problem with the kernel and not only with the Nvidia driver 
(hence, the reason for posting here).
Any advice/info would be appreciated.
TIA,
Ashwin.
