Hi, 
While running a cpu-hotplug test involving a high priority
process (SCHED_RR, prio=94) trying to periodically offline and
online cpu1 on a 2-processor machine, I noticed that the system was
becoming unresponsive after a few iterations.
However, when the same test was repeated with processors
greater than 2, it worked fine. 
Also, if the hotplugging process, was not of rt-prio, it
worked fine on a 2-processor machine.
After some debugging, I saw that the hang occured because
the high prio process was stuck in a loop doing yield() inside
wait_task_inactive(). Description follows:
Say a high-prio task (A) does a kthread_create(B),
followed by a kthread_bind(B, cpu1). At this moment, 
only cpu0 is online.
Now, immediately after being created, B would
do a 
complete(&create->started) [kernel/kthread.c: kthread()], 
before scheduling itself out.
This complete() will wake up kthreadd, which had spawned B.
It is possible that during the wakeup, kthreadd might preempt B.
Thus, B is still on the runqueue, and not yet called schedule().
kthreadd, will inturn do a 
complete(&create->done); [kernel/kthread.c: create_kthread()]
which will wake up the thread which had called kthread_create().
In our case it's task A, which will run immediately, since its priority
is higher.
A will now call kthread_bind(B, cpu1).
kthread_bind(), calls wait_task_inactive(B), to ensures that 
B has scheduled itself out.
B is still on the runqueue, so A calls yield() in wait_task_inactive().
But since A is the task with the highest prio, scheduler schedules it
back again.
Thus B never gets to run to schedule itself out.
A loops waiting for B to schedule out leading  to system hang.
In my case,
A was the high priority process trying to bring up cpu1, and
thus doing a kthread_create/kthread_bind in 
migration_call(): CPU_UP_PREPARE.
B was the migration thread for cpu1.
And the above problem occurs when only one cpu is online.
Possible solutions to this problem:
a) Let the newly spawned kernel threads inherit
   their parent's prio and policy. 
b) Instead of using yield() in wait_task_inactive(), we could use
   something like a yield_to(p):
    yield_to(struct task_struct p)
    {
    	int old_prio = p->prio;
	/* Temporarily boost p's priority atleast to that of current task */
    	if (current->prio > old_prio)
		set_prio(p, current->prio);
	yield();
	/* Reset priority back to the original value */
	set_prio(p, old_prio);
    }
Thoughts?
Thanks and Regards
gautham.
