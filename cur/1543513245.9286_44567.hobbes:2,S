Subject: signal question (possible bug in ipc/sem)

I'm threading ipc/sem.c and I don't understand the signal handling of
the current code:
sys_semop() just calls interruptible_sleep_on(), and if that function
returns premature, then sys_semop() assumes that a signal arrived and
returns with -EINTR.
It does not call "signal_pending()"
Is that a bug? At least, it has very strange effects:
my test application:
* uses the default signal mask.
* if it sleeps in sys_semop() and I use bash jobs control, then
sys_semop() returns with errno=EINTR when I switch from stopped to
foreground.
This affects both 2.3.22 and 2.2.12.
