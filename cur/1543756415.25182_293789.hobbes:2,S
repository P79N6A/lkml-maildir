Yeah, I don't think it's safe to use "driver_data".  Although it can be a
set of flags, it's also often used as an index in an array, or as a
pointer.  An invalid value could result in an oops.
Most drivers don't use "driver_data".  For those that do, it might be
helpful to have the capability of setting a few static configuration values
before probing the device. Currently "driver_data" fills this role.
Perhaps we need a new mechanism that would be more useable with sysfs?
The current code is limiting because the configuration options in
"driver_data" are not well defined.  Any ideas?
Thanks,
Adam
P.S.: The pci serial driver is a good example.
