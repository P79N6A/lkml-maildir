Ok, but not everyone has 2 CPUs and
most of us own UP machines, but want the low-latency features,
which are not hardware limits actually.

I think the can't give a mathematical proof, of upper-bound latencies,
that's why I created my latencytest benchmark.
Running this benchark with stressing the machine as much as possible,
for a long time , and getting NO DROP outs means a RELIABLE RT APP for me.
Call it hard-realtime, soft-realtime , firm-realtime, but what matters
is if the deadlines are meed under high system load or not.

several = hundreds , in the DMA=off disk mode even thousands ...
:-)
but preliminary tests with a short patch from Andrea Arcangeli,
which reschedules processes after writing blocks to disk,
show nice improvements in the sync mode and dma=off mode,
I will post some figures soon.

Ok fully agree, 
but the BIG QUESTION is : are the ALSA / kernel developers REALLY interested
in this spinlocking problem, or is this VERY LOW PRIORITY ?
"Ok we are aware the problem , we will work on it when we get time (in 1-2
years), but actually we have much higher priority tasks , like keeping up with
the MINDCRAFT benchmarks."
:-))
I think it this problem will not be fixed soon ( <1 year) , then Linux will
miss it's chance as a MULTIMEDIA OS.
And that's not compatible with the term "world domination".
:-)
I'm just curious how AMIGA plans to solve these issues ,
using a RT-Linux scheme or a firm-real-time scheme ala KURT ?
I think under QNX, this would be very easy,
just run the audio driver, and your RT app at higher priority, than
other driver et voila. (one of the advantages of microkernel)
:-)
RT Linux sounds nice to me, but without memory-protection,
runnnig audio-plugins, becomes very dangerous (look at DirectX),
if there is a bug, the poor Linux box gets down.
At least I would prefer, a crash of the audio engine, which you can
restart again.
And I agree with Paul,  a MIDI sequencer or soft-syth is an app ,which need
to make systemcalls AND must run with some time constraints.
Some plugins could run in the Audiality context,
but other parts of the program must run as soft-REAL time app,
and it would be nice if the soft-realtime part stays under the 5ms mark all the
time.
comments ?
