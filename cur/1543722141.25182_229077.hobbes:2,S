I've also had trouble with the eepro100 driver. I help maintain a 16-node
HPC cluster of VA Linux 2200 2x2 with on-board Intel EtherExpress Pro 100
NICs. During times of high network traffic, the eepro100 driver would just
cause the card to lose its carrier. Switching to the e100 driver solved
this problem.
