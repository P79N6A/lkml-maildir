Right.
Which make me wonder why we need task_lock() at all ..I can understand
the need for a lock like that if we are reading/updating multiple words
in task_struct under the lock. In this case, it is used to read/write
just one pointer, isnt it? I think it can be eliminated all-together
with the use of RCU.
