I keep hearing this mantra.  What is so compelling about the .25
release?  When seems to be more important than what.  While I understand
product release cycles, etc. and can certainly agree with them. I would
like to know with what I am being asked to agree.
That said, I agree we should probably finish getting the comments on
Andrea's most recent patch, if any, cleared up and put that one in.
