These were taken from include/linux/usb.h
No new functions or defines were created.

 - Moved the HID specific defines and functions into include/linux/usb.h
 - Added _lots_ of documentation (which involved moving things around to
   be in a more logical order).
 - removed the FILL_BULK_URB_TO and FILL_INT_URB_TO macros as they were
   not being used
 - added the usb_fill_control_urb(), usb_fill_bulk_urb() and
   usb_fill_int_urb() inline functions to be used instead of the
   FILL_*_URB macros.
Hope this helps,
