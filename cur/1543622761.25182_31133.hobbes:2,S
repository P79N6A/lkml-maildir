Err what?
Why would the names of functions in the orinoco_cs driver affect the
usability of the pcmcia-cs package on a particular kernel?
I think you're doing something wrong.  The only circumstance I could
imagine this making a difference is if you're trying to mix some of
the orinoco modules from the kernel tree with other orinoco modules
from the pcmcia-cs tree.
