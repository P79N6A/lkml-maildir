I know Ingo said to do this, but I think he was flat-out wrong. If the
tradeoff is between having a dozen ifdefs contained in a single function
in one .c file vs wrapping a dozen function in a .h file, I say stick
them in the .c file.
Best would be to have no ifdefs and do it all with linker magic, of
course. But that's trickier.
Now the patch is 90% fiddling with wrappers and it's impossible to find
the interesting bits anymore..
