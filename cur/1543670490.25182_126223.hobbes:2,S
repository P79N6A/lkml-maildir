Actually, that is very much not obvious.
Especially if you're familiar with architectures where every move has an  
implicit test (typically for zero and sign), and so checking for the zero  
byte during the move is quite obviously the only sane thing to do - the  
version with a count is slower, because the inner loop does more. (Those  
architectures typically don't have a REP-style prefix.)
