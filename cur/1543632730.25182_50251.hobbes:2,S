Please - Why do you call it bind? Does it have something with
netowrking to do? Please just name it attach. This way the old UNIX
guys among us won't have to drag a too big
"UNIX to Linux translation dictionary" around with them.
As an "added bonus" you will stay consistent with -
PCMCIA code base in kernel
USB code base in kernel
IDE code base (well recently)
just to name a few.
Thanks.
