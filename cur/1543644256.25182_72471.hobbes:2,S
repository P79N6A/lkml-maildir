Hi,
I got the following log messages inside an user mode linux:
,----
| kernel: copy_thread : clone failed - errno = 1
| kernel: flush_thread : new thread failed, errno = 1
| kernel: flush_thread : new thread failed, errno = 1
| kernel: copy_thread : clone failed - errno = 1
`----
No new processes could be started in the uml, but why?
Is this a problem with the process limits of the host linux?
Regards,
Martin
