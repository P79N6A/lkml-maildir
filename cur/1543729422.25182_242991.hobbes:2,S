Setting commit to zero doesn't seem to disable it, judging from my local 
2.6.8.1-mm1 source.
super.c has:
case Opt_commit:
   if (match_int(&args[0], &option))
      return 0;
   if (option < 0)
      return 0;
   if (option == 0)
      option = JBD_DEFAULT_MAX_COMMIT_AGE;
   sbi->s_commit_interval = HZ * option;
   break;
Where JBD_DEFAULT_COMMIT_AGE is defined to 5 in include/linux/jbd.h. So it 
seems that setting it to zero will just set it to the default commit interval 
of 5 seconds. Am I missing something?
