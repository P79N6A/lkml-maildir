The mem_map isn't a pointer, its a physical structure.  We have a 
special value to tell you if the page is usable within that, thats 
called PG_reserved.  If this page is reserved the kernel can't touch it, 
can't look at it.

Whilst I can understand that not knowing if a page is real or not is 
perhaps unappealing, I've yet to see any case where we need or care. 
Changing things to make things 'nicer' interlectually is sometimes 
worthwhile.  But what is the user here.
The only consumer you have shown is show_mem() which is a debug 
function, and that only dumps out the current memory counts.  Its not 
clear it cares to really know if a page is real or not.
