That's weird. It has been working for me out of the box.

So the fact that it works for me is a freak accident?
I have this in lilo.conf:
append="md=d0,/dev/sda,/dev/sdb root=/dev/md_d0p1 "
and this is dmesg:
md: Autodetecting RAID arrays.
md: autorun ...
md: ... autorun DONE.
md: Loading md_d0: /dev/sda
md: bind<sda>
md: bind<sdb>
raid1: raid set md_d0 active with 2 out of 2 mirrors
