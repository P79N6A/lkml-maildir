There are a number of things that the watchdog in e100 does.  It
checks link (up, down), reads the hardware stats, adjusts the adaptive
IFS and checks to 3 known hang conditions based on certain types of
the hardware.  You might be able to get around without doing the
work-arounds (as long as you don't' see hangs happening with the
hardware being used) but the checking of the link and the stats are
probably needed.
