Setting up an account for a mailing list and linking unmaintained parts
to it would be a solution to that. Either set up a specific list for
this or use when of the current ones (like LKML). The big problem I see
at the moment is that not all parts of the kernel are represented in the
bugzilla.

I agree that most bug reports are incomplete. But I still think that a
bugzilla is the way to go. We need to educate the users in filing bug
reports no matter which forum is used. Russell's point about having a
wizard would probably help a lot. A bugzilla also gives the option of
marking bugs with NEEDINFO, INVALID and similar, clearly expressing to
the user how the maintainer sees this bug.

I think that the categories NEW/ASSIGNED/CONFIRMED suffices. Although
discussions on mailing lists are more natural for the people here I
don't agree that bugzilla is less interactive than lists.
