Hi Alan,
That's what I was wondering.
Thanks for confirming it.
Do you know if there was any particular reason why it was changed that
signals can't be delivered to an exiting process in 2.6?
Was there maybe some sort of race, and this was the best way to resolve
it?
Using "setserial" to set a timeout value to bail is just "not right".
In most cases, people do NOT want the data to be tossed away after
the timeout expires.
Imagine a printer stuck in a hardware flow control state because the
printer ran out of paper.
The user would end up losing the tail end of their print job!
Setting a infinite timeout value with setserial is also bad.
Without being able to take a 2nd+ signal, the port ends up being stuck
forever.
Only a reboot, or a reassertion of CTS would "fix" it.
