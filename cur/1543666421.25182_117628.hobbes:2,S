See 2.4.21-pre5-ac2 or later. You are discussing obsolete and known
broken code otherwise. The -ac code is closer to working and has most
but alas it seems not all the reset stuff fixed. While this works for
2.4 the 2.5 ide-scsi error handling has been rewritten by someone for
the scsi changes and so differs from both the 2.4 style scsi error
handling and reality by some margin. Once the reset code settles down
in 2.4.21-pre5-ac and 2.5.64-ac I'll take a crack at ide-scsi again.
