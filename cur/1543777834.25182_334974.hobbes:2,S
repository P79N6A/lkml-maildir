Hi All,
  I would like to know whether the usage of 253 as major (device) number
in serial port drivers is restricted in 2.6.x kernels.  I am asking this
question, though the documentation tells the driver developers that 253
is a reserved major number, 2.6.x Linux kernels can accommodate more
than 255.
  Also I would like to know the procedure (and related info) to apply
for getting a static number (major/minor) for devices in device drivers.
Is this practice continued still?
  Thanks for your help.
Regards,
V. Ananda Krishnan
