Subject: ANNOUNCE: Intermezzo + Intersync 0.9.3 release
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

A new version of intersync/intermezzo has been uploaded to 
ftp://ftp.inter-mezzo.org
:/pub/intermezzo
The binary rpm now installs the source for the intermezzo module in
/usr/src/intermezzo-0.9.3, which needs to be configured and built for
your kernel. We will be submitting this for 2.4 soon.
What's new:
 - non-intermezzo readable files are replicated
 - full replicas are supported (not just data on demand) 
 - even simpler configuration: no need to specific channel or local
     port when replicating on the same host
