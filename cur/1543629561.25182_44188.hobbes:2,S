All the patches i've seen thus far were for some other chip (forgot the 
ID), but for that 9835 i needed it desperately so i tested it quite a lot. 
+	/* netmos_9835 (not tested) */	{ 1, { { 2, -1 }, } },
I'm not sure about the others, but i doubt that one would work. Where 
there conflicting success/failure reports for the same devices?
