IIRC, __stop_machine_run is used by subsystems other than cpu-hotplug. 
So we're not the only ones bugged.

But each of these stop_machine_run threads run at MAX_RT_PRIO - 1 
with SCHED_FIFO. So unless B is also running at MAX_RT_PRIO - 1,
there should not be a hang. Moreover, I doubt if we have kernel threads(B)
which runs at MAX_RT_PRIO - 1.
Nevertheless, with the freezer based approach that we're experimenting,
this problem shouldn't arise. We expect the whole system to get frozen
before we actually do a cpu_down() (which will then call
__stop_machine_run). So any such rogue RT task will have to first fail
the freezer ( which it will), but that's ok, since on a freezer-fail,
we just thaw all the processes and get the system up and running again.
Yeah, the cpu-hotplug operation will fail though.
