That free email-address <robotti@godmail.com> doesn't seem to be working,
so I haven't gotten any mail there in awhile.
I have another email address that does work, but I have no interface to it.
I can download mail using fetchmail and read/reply using mutt, perhaps
that would do.
This is the good email-address: <dwilson24@nyc.rr.com>
