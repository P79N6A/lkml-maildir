Hi!
> The embedded controller on ThinkPad laptops has a non-standard interface
> at IO ports 0x1600-0x161F (mapped to LCP channel 3 of the H8S chip).
> The interface provides various system management services (currently 
> known: battery information and accelerometer readouts). This driver
> provides access and mutual exclusion for the EC interface.
> 
> The mainline hdaps driver already uses this hardware interface (in an 
> incorrect and unsafe way), and will be converted to use this module in
> the following patches. Another driver using this module, tp_smapi, will 
> be submitted later.
> 
> The Kconfig entry is set to tristate and will be selected by hdaps and
> (eventually) tp_smapi, since thinkpad_ec does nothing by itself.

Is not there generic function doing this?

Linuxdoc?

Do we need these wrappers? Perhaps just directly exporting the mutex?

I'd write i++ here (and in other loops)... just for consistency with
rest of kernel.

unneeded initializer.

KERN_ERR is little strong here, no?

Thanks for all the (sleeping) penguins.
