Ok, I finally went and looked at your tree for real and I see
the cleanup is actually there, good :)
So now, let's see how to get rid of those CONFIG_PPC, either by
having everybody define iobarrier_*() or having {read,write}s{b,w,l},
I just started a new thread on the list just about that.
Jens: can you look into merging -ac's iops change to 2.5 ? That
would fix it.
Ben.
