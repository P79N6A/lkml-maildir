It's using the RAM shadow at c0000 on these ...
I'm still not convinced that having the struct resource allocated and
mismatched with the BAR value is a good thing... But anyway, so the bug
would then be pci_map_rom who is writing the enable bit without fixing
the rest of the BAR...
So what about fixing pci_map_rom() to call pcibios_resource_to_bus() and
then write the resource back to the BAR ? I'm still a bit annoyed that
we re-allocate the address while the original one was perfectly good
(though not enabled) but the above would work.
Ben.
