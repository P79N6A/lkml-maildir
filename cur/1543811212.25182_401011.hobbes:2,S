My 50 MB number was much too high (I didn't want to think where exactly 
to set the borderline).
My point is that if you are in an environment that is that space limited 
that you want to see options that allow e.g. not building futexes, 
module support with an impact of approx. 10% on code size would be one 
of the first things you should disable.
