Probably true.

Not fatal, just like every user of i_extra_isize.  If the inode isn't a
large inode, or it can't be expanded then there will be a minor loss of
functionality on that inode.  If the i_extra_isize is critical, then
the sysadmin will have run e2fsck to force s_min_extra_isize large enough.
Note that this is only applicable for filesystems which are upgraded.  For
new inodes (i.e. all inodes that exist in the filesystem if it was always
run on a kernel with the currently understood extra fields) then this will
never be invoked (until such a time new extra fields are added).

Only under code defect or memory corruption.  The needed extra space was
already checked in ext4_expand_extra_isize_ea(), but I asked for this
BUG_ON() because it would otherwise seem that there was a chance from
reading just the above code that the shifted EA might overflow the buffer.

Well, since this is the only code that ever changes i_extra_isize, and it
also needs to move the EAs around, it makes sense to use the EA lock for it.
This is also a relatively low-contention lock, and it needs to be held to
access any of the EAs (which are the only things beyond i_extra_isize).

Seems likely, yes.
