I guess there will be cries of murder if 'somebody' suggested that if
a node in /dev is opened, but not there, the kernel can call
'modprobe -q /dev/foo' to load whatever alias there might have been?
Understand me correctly, I do not want devfs back.  I am just checking
if we could do something for similar behaviour.  I know it has not
_really_ hit the lists, but I have already had complaints about this
not being supported anymore.  I think the complaints will start even
more if raminitfs eventually hits functionality (as /dev will then be
then consisting only of loaded drivers (if I am not mistaken).
Once again I do not say we should give in to it, but it _does_ make
things easier.  So if there is a lightweight way to do this, then
great - and this is what I was trying to get discussion directed to.

Ok, was just wondering.
