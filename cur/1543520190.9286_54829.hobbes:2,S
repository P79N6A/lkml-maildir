Hi. I've been having increasing problems with my system, and have been
getting the following errors on console and syslog intermittently for
the last several months. (Tested with 2.0.38 and 2.2.13) My .config is
at 
http://www.peakpeak.com/~socket/config.txt
 to save traffic space.
kernel: hdb: dma_intr: status=0x71 { DriveReady DeviceFault SeekComplete Error }
kernel: hdb: dma_intr: error=0x10 { SectorIdNotFound }, LBAsect=4850553, sector=4850490
kernel: hda: DMA disabled
kernel: hdb: DMA disabled
kernel: ide0: reset: success
I recently purchased an IDE Mitsumi 4802TE CD-RW drive, currently
/dev/hdd or /dev/scd1, while a very generic IDE CDROM is on /dev/hdc
and scd0.  This morning, booting as usual with ide-scsi in my
/etc/modules, gave me an aiee, which I copied by hand and later
placed at 
http://www.peakpeak.com/~socket/aiee.txt
 
I assume this is in the ide-scsi module, because it happens just after
the kernel message 'scsi: 1 host'. (Forgive my stupidity, my attempts
at determining the functions in the call trace have failed. ksymoops
doesn't compile in 2.2.13: oops.c:42: bfd.h: No such file or
directory. )
Thinking that things would work with ide-cd instead of ide-scsi, I
tried mounting my CDROM with that, and got the following messages
scrolling down my screen:
kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev 16:40 (hdd), sector 0
kernel: hdd: tray open
This is odd because I mounted /dev/hdc... *not* /dev/hdd.  Neither
tray was open.
Several of these spewed out in the process:
kernel: hdd: command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
kernel: hdd: command error: error=0x50
I tried to telnet in from another box with no luck, and was forced to
push the red button.
On next boot, I had even more problems:
kernel: EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,65)): ext2_check_blocks_bitmap: Wrong free blocks count for group 232, stored = 6141, counted = 6156
kernel: Remounting filesystem read-only
(repeated a few times with different numbers)
EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,65)): ext2_check_blocks_bitmap: Wrong free blocks  count in super block, stored = 2099371, counted = 2099450
kernel: Remounting filesystem read-only
(and then...)
kernel: EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,65)): ext2_check_inodes_bitmap: Wrong free inodes count in group 232, stored = 1879, counted = 1891
kernel: Remounting filesystem read-only
(repeated a few times with different numbers)
My IDE hardware is properly detected by the kernel:
kernel: hda: SAMSUNG SV0432A, ATA DISK drive
kernel: hdb: FUJITSU MPD3108AT, ATA DISK drive
kernel: hdc: ATAPI CD ROM VER 4.1, ATAPI CDROM drive
kernel: hdd: CR-4802TE, ATAPI CDROM drive
My system is a single-processor Celeron 400 (not overclocked) on a
Asus P2B motherboard and 64 megs RAM.  Any other information needed
can be provided, I'm on the digest, I'm available assuming my hardware
doesn't crumble to dust before my eyes.
