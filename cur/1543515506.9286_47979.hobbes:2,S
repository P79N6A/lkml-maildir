Are you still talking about a cache of zeroed pages? Looks a bad idea to
me.
It can only improve latency after some idle time. If your CPU are under
100% of load for a long time you'll have to spend the memset(0) time
anyway but in another place and with an additional scheduler cost. Also
the idle task will be less fast in rescheduling itself.
