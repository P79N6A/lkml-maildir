No, it's not; all it's doing is deferring the device_put() from the
scsi_put_command() to after the scsi_run_queue(), which doesn't fix the
sleep while atomic problem of the device release method.  In both cases
we still get the semaphore in atomic context problem which is caused by
scsi_reap_target() doing a device_del(), which I assumed (wrongly) was
valid from atomic context.
I'll fix the scsi_reap_target(), but it's nothing to do with the patch
you reversed.

I'll find a fix for the real problem, but this patch isn't the cause.
