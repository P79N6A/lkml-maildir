I don't think that makes any sense. If you really do find missing
functionality that are candidates to be generic block property, we can
add them.

I don't know why you are even worrying about this yet, time will decide
what happens. As it stands right now, I still consider your driver to be
something to play with, not something that should go into the kernel
anytime soon.
Maybe in 6 months time it has evolved to be something really great, we
add it then. Right now you are still in the design stages in some areas.
