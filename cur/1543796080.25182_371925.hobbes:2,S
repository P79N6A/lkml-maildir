Not in the IDE case.  Bart restricted IDE to a smaller number of ARM
platforms, plus any that had PCMCIA.  There is no such restriction
in the asm-arm/*.h header files.
if PCMCIA || ARCH_CLPS7500 || ARCH_IOP3XX || ARCH_IXP4XX \
        || ARCH_L7200 || ARCH_LH7A40X || ARCH_PXA || ARCH_RPC \
        || ARCH_S3C2410 || ARCH_SA1100 || ARCH_SHARK || FOOTBRIDGE
