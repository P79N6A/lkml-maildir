Actually, it looked to me like there was a bus hang, a device reset, the 
driver returned a complete reset to the error handler thread, then the 
error handler thread kicked the queue before the CD was ready to accept 
commands again and as a result of sense info saying as much the mid layer 
took the device off line.  So, in short, the mid layer isn't waiting long 
enough, or when it gets sense indicated not ready it needs to implement a 
waiting queue with a timeout to try rekicking things a few times and don't 
actually mark the device off line until a longer period of time has 
elasped without the device coming back.
As for getting it to be not off line without rebooting, just do a this:
echo "scsi-remove-single-device 0 0 6 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi
echo "scsi-add-single-device 0 0 6 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi
That'll remove the device and then rescan it.  Assuming it's had enough 
time to complete the reset by the time you do this and it's once again 
ready to accept commands, this should get your CD back working.
