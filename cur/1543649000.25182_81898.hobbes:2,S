The whole point of the copyright assignment is that FSF becomes 
copyright owner.
This is so that Jeff Garzik cannot be strongarmed into changing the 
license on his code, or some other anti-software-freedom tactic levied 
against me in the future.  In theory, the FSF as an organization will 
protect the rights of the software when I might weaken and give in.
But in exchange for that protection, you are willingly giving up your 
rights as copyright owner...  Less freedom for [hopefully] better 
protection.  Just like everything in life, it's a tradeoff... :)
