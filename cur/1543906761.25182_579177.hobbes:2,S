yeah, they are all already under CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG. (it's just that the 
add-on optimization is not upstream yet - the tunings are still being 
tested) Btw., with SCHED_DEBUG we now also have your domain-tree sysctl 
patch upstream, which has been in -mm for a near eternity.

it was on an older Athlon64 X2. I never saw indirect calls really 
hurting on modern x86 CPUs - dont both CPU makers optimize them pretty 
efficiently? (as long as the target function is always the same - which 
it is here.)

yeah - i'll try that too. We can make the indirect call the uncommon 
case and a NULL pointer be the common case, combined with a 'default', 
direct function call. But i doubt it makes a big (or even measurable) 
difference.
