...however it also forces you to export a lot of stuff which is really
private to fscache.c (the atomics etc).

Actually, as long as launder_page() and invalidate_page() are doing
their thing, then your current code might be OK. The important thing is
to ensure that invalidate_inode_pages2() and truncate_inode_pages() work
as expected.

What you should be doing here is probably to make a call to
wait_on_page_fscache_write(page). That should suffice to ensure that the
page is clean w.r.t. fscache activity afaics.

Right. You might also want to add a flag NFS_INO_INVALID_FSCACHE_ATTR or
something like that in order to trigger it.

Why? It should be possible to set this up so that the NFS+fscache code
compiles correctly without the mount patch.
