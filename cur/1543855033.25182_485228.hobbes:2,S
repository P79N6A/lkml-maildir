How about this?
	struct xxx_struct {
		int completed;
		atomic_t ctr[2];
		struct mutex mutex;
		wait_queue_head_t wq;
	};
	void init_xxx_struct(struct xxx_struct *sp)
	{
		sp->completed = 0;
		atomic_set(sp->ctr + 0, 1);	// active
		atomic_set(sp->ctr + 1, 0);	// inactive
		mutex_init(&sp->mutex);
		init_waitqueue_head(&sp->wq);
	}
	int xxx_read_lock(struct xxx_struct *sp)
	{
		for (;;) {
			int idx = sp->completed & 0x1;
			if (likely(atomic_inc_not_zero(sp->ctr + idx)))
				return idx;
		}
	}
	void xxx_read_unlock(struct xxx_struct *sp, int idx)
	{
		if (unlikely(atomic_dec_and_test(sp->ctr + idx)))
			wake_up(&sp->wq);
	}
	void synchronize_xxx(struct xxx_struct *sp)
	{
		int idx;
		mutex_lock(&sp->mutex);
		idx = ++sp->completed & 0x1;
		smp_mb__before_atomic_inc();
		atomic_inc(&sp->ctr + idx);
		idx = !idx;
		if (!atomic_dec_and_test(&sp->ctr + idx))
			__wait_event(&sp->wq, !atomic_read(&sp->ctr + idx));
		mutex_unlock(&sp->mutex);
	}
Yes, cache thrashing... But I think this is hard to avoid if we want writer
to be fast.
I do not claim this is the best solution, but for some reason I'd like to
suggest something that doesn't need synchronize_sched(). What do you think
about correctness at least?
Oleg.
