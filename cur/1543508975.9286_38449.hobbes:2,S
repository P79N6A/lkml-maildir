Documentation/parport.txt cannot tell you that it is factually correct,
only that it syntactically correct.  If there isn't a port at 0x378, then
'parport=0x378' is wrong.
Do you mean that you know for a fact that 0x378 is the right place to look
for the parallel port on that machine?
I haven't tried any of the recent development kernels (I've been away from
my machine for a while).  I'll do that soon.
Tim.
