Ok, that would imply that we'll need to bump the version to 1.1 or
something. So how about something like this? I'll also run it past the
OSDL lawyer, and if others were to run it past their lawyers, that would
be good.
I can't imagine that this change really would upset anybody, but hey,
let's double- and triple-check before I commit something like this.. As
mentioned, I think everybody is _very_ aware that Linux is a public
project, and I can't imagine that there are kernel developers who haven't
seen the changelogs we keep, so this feels a bit unnecessary, but let's 
be careful..
