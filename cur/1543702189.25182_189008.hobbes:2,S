I'm getting very bad receive rates with a Netgear FA-120 USB2 Ethernet
adapter under Linux 2.6.0.  Timing an incoming TCP stream, I get only
600 kB/s.  Sending works properly at 10 MB/s.  I first reported this
problem some time in July or August.  Is it just me having this issue?
Can I get any helpful information somehow?
