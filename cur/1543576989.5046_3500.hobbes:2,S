In moving from 2.2.x to 2.4.x I have found that
PS/2 Esdi will no longer boot.  The problem was 
introduced by what appears to have been a small
architectural change that shouldn't have had an
impact.  I am looking into it, if anyone has an
idea of what could be causing this, please mail
me.  The relevant change occured at 2.3.32-pre3
A new parameter was add to xxx_do_request.  The
parameter isn't used by ps2esdi_do_request, but
I can't see why it should have caused any drive
problems.  Hopefully, I will figure the problem
out within the next week.
