Well, with the exception of backup/restore (which will just treat this
EA data as opaque and doesn't really care whether the names are fixed
or not), the tools DO need to understand each individual module
or policy in order to make any sense of the data.  Otherwise, all you
can do is print out some binary blob which is no use to anyone.
So, either the tools look for "system.security", and then have to
understand an internal magic for each module to know what to do with
the data, or it looks for "system.<modulename>" for only module names
that it actually understands.
The only reason to use a common "system.security" is if the actual data
stored therein was usable by more than a single security module.
Cheers, Andreas
