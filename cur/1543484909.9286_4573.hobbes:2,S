Brad,
For what its worth, I had the exact same problem.
In my case, everything worked great up until the
2.2.x kernels, then everything except Networking
functioned.
Symptoms were exactly as you describe, no pings
in or out.
I ended up reinstalling 5.2, and now the 2.2.1 Kernel
works fine, go figure.
I don't think its a hardware thing, as my hardware worked
fine in 2.2.0-pre, and earlier, and now works fine in
2.2.1.
I was wondering if its an EGCS thing, I WAS using
EGCS (Jan 24th snapshot), now Im back to the GCC
that comes with RH 5.2
My hardware is:
Abit BH-6
Celeron 300A
128Mb
Adaptec 2940U
SCSI + EIDE + EIDE CDROM
Diamond Permedia 2 Video
3Com 3C905B ethernet card.
