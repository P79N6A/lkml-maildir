Indeed; it made the situation bearable again. :) Thanks!
There is _another_ issue, maybe an academic one, that I'd like to ask
about.  Maybe someone could help illuminate the issue; it regards the
releasing of swapped pages.
Summary: If I open a suitably large text file in Emacs, and the system
swaps liberally, and the application is closed -- those swapped pages are
not immediately released in 2.3.99-pre* (up to pre3-5), but only upon
"demand".
Here's an example.
Starting situation, in X-windows, under 2.3.99-pre3-5:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         30348      29776        572          0        284      22344
minus buffers/cache:     7148      23200
Swap:        32764       3008      29756
Now open a large Emacs session, go 23M into swap. Close Emacs. Then look:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         30348      27136       3212          0        160      22748
minus buffers/cache:     4228      26120
Swap:        32764      17640      15124
Hmmm, there's nothing significant running anymore, yet 17M is shown paged
out. If I go and 'dd if=/dev/zero of=dump.dat bs=1024k count=40', or
attempt to allocate "relatively large" amounts of memory, _then_ those
swapped pages are freed and I get back to where I started:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         30348      29568        780          0        552      21660
minus buffers/cache:     7356      22992
Swap:        32764       3644      29120
So... is it better to release swapped pages immediately, or only upon
"demand"?  I would have naively guessed the former, but maybe I'm
missing a crucial point. 
Thoughts?
