In x86, there is even more space for a bootloader (some 28k or so)
even if your partition table is as closely packed as possible,
from 0 to 7e00 IIRC.
For sparc you could have something like
			startlba	endlba	type
	sda1		0		2	1 Boot
	sda2		2		58	3 Whole disk
	sda3		58		90000	83 Linux
and slap the bootloader into "MBR", just like on x86.
Or I am missing something..
