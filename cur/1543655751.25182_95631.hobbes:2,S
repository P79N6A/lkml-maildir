Two notes here:
- The behavior of sched_yield() changed a lot.  A task that uses
  this system call should now expect to sleep for possibly a very
  long time.  Tasks that do not really desire to give up the
  processor for a while should probably not make heavy use of this
  function.  Unfortunately, some GUI programs (like Open Office)
  do make excessive use of this call and under load their
  performance is poor.  It seems this new 2.5 behavior is optimal
  but some user-space applications may need fixing.
- The above applies to use of yield() in the kernel, too.
- 2.5 adds system calls for manipulating a task's processor
  affinity: sched_getaffinity() and sched_setaffinity()
