Unless I misread his question, he didn't ask how to make it reliable,
he just wants the partitioning software to use it. Not to use something
he provides by hand, to ask the BIOS and use the numbers, right or
wrong.
With old BIOS versions I will agree that using any other geometry, no
matter how correct or reliable, will result in a failure to boot.
I wish I had an answer to the original question, but I don't. Fdisk
tries to intuit what partition info if there is at least one partition
already created, if that's the partitioning software you are already
using, I can't offer any other help.
