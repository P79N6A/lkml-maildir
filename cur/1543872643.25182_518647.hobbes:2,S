ISTR that apps varied wrt. their expectations for yield(). Some,
particularly those using it to implement multi-tiered userspace locks,
really did expect to go all the way to the back of the queue. (Rumor has
it that realtime apps break otherwise.) Others wanted a kinder, gentler,
"mistress, please hit me, but not too hard" opportunity to let someone
else have a little cpu time, particularly when userspace is spinning in
some sort of busywait. In both scenarios something very much against
the latest trends of Linux kernel politics is done by userspace.

My dumb idea would be to break out new syscall. One for the kinder,
gentler version, one for the serious version. Or otherwise pass an
argument indicating the expected behavior. Then a dumb app can be
LD_PRELOAD'd into calling whatever makes it run fastest.
