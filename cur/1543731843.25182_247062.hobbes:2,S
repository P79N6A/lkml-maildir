flock affects local node only traditionally and applications expect high
performance from it. Our documentation merely says
       flock(2) does not lock files over NFS.  Use fcntl(2) instead:
that does
       work  over  NFS,  given  a  sufficiently  recent version of Linux
and a
       server which supports locking.
I'm not sure how we should count GFS but other than noting a need to
think about it I see no problems with a cluster being "local"
