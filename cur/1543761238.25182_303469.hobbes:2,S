Hi
Running a 32 bits application on a x86_64 kernel gives more virtual 
address : 4GB of user memory, instead of 3GB on a standard 32bits kernel
If your application uses a lot of in-kernel ressources (like tcp 
sockets and network buffers), it also wont be constrained by the 
pressure a 32 bits kernel has on lowmem (typically 896 MB of lowmem)
If your machine has less than 2GB, running a 64bits kernel is not a 
win, because all kernel data use more ram (pointers are 64 bits 
instead of 32bits)
