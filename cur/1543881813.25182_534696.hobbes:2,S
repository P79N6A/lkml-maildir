Subject: 2.6.20.7 mss negotiation and path mtu discovery mostly broken?

I'm seeing a problem where the kernel attempts to send packets with a
MSS larger than the one negotiated when the TCP connection is
established. Even after ICMP "can't fragment" messages arrive, the
kernel still attempts to increase the MSS rather aggressively. The end
result is extremely poor throughput when sending to a network with a
smaller MTU. 
In /proc/sys/net/ipv4:
ip_no_pmtu_disc:0
tcp_mtu_probing:0
The sending host (10.2.10.254) has an MTU of 9000. The destination host
(12.33.234.69) has an MTU of 1500. There is one router between the hosts
which will drop packets with the "DF" flag when they don't fit the
destination interface's MTU and generates the required icmp can't
fragment message. 
The dump shows the initial handshake with correct mss options sent:
08:39:55.493029 IP 12.33.234.69.35026 > 10.2.10.254.22: S
2768979373:2768979373(
0) win 5840 <mss 1460,sackOK,timestamp 3873837730 0,nop,wscale 2>
08:39:55.493119 IP 10.2.10.254.22 > 12.33.234.69.35026: S
963242385:963242385(0)
 ack 2768979374 win 17896 <mss 8960,sackOK,timestamp 413751
3873837730,nop,wscal
e 5>
Then I see the system send larger packets (larger than the mss),
provoking a "can't fragment" from the router. Now I suppose it might be
reasonable to occasionally probe a larger MSS when the current MSS is a
result of reductions due to path mtu discovery. After all, the path
taken could change over time. But when the current MSS is at the value
negotiated by the MSS option during the TCP handshake, it seems like
there's no sense in trying to send with a lager MSS. Even if there were,
there's certainly no justification for making such an attempt every
other packet (2.6.18) or every fourth packet (2.6.20.7). 
In the following dump, the system eventually gets in a state where it
oscillates between sendng undeliverable 2896 byte packets and
deliverable 1448 byte ones.

Since any sane router will only generate can't fragment ICMP's at a
limited rate, for two hosts on gigabit ethernet, one on a MTU 1500
subnet and another on a MTU 9000 subnet, I can move only 40-50KB/sec
over an affected TCP connection. 
I was unable to find any reference to this problem in the kernel
changelogs, or even any reports of anyone else having a similar problem.
The above dumps are from 2.6.19.7. I could also reproduce the problem in
2.6.18, although the dumps looked slightly different. I was unable to
reproduce this problem with the 2.6.9-42.0.10.ELsmp kernel which ships
in RHEL4. 
I can send a pcap dump to anyone interested.
