Hi Russell,
I agree. For 2.4, Stability before elegance. Minimum change is a good thing.
The patch looks straight-forward enough, simply plop the file into a
directory for which it was never intended. It does localize the effect of
the change nicely. 
I have a question. Similar changes have been suggested several times and
always seem to bring out a small hail of rather negative comments. (like
"gross hack ..." :) 
Are there any hidden issues with the patch? That is, beyond the decrease in
maintainability? I didn't see anything relevant to this technique in the
lkml archive. I'm a little wary of anything that gets an "oh no, not this
again" reaction. Hmmm... I think I hear the distant sound of arrows being
sharpened. 
Best regards,
Ed
