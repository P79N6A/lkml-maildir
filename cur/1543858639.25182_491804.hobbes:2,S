Whatever the change is, it's subtle. I don't see the problem in git1+patch, 
but I know this kernel _includes_ this changeset.
In total isolation, v2.6.19..0e75f9063f5c55fb0b0b546a7c356f8ec186825e it 
breaks. Reverting just 0e75f9063f5c55fb0b0b546a7c356f8ec186825e, it works 
again.
So I think this is the source, but I can't explain why it "goes away" before 
git1 and "comes back" before 2.6.20-rc1.
