That's an interesting point.  page_table_lock is one of those locks
which is occasionally held for ages, and frequently held for a short
time.
I suspect that yes, voluntarily popping the lock during the long holdtimes
will allow other CPUs to get on with stuff, and will provide efficiency
increases.  (It's a pretty lame way of doing that though).
But I don't recall seeing nasty page_table_lock spintimes on
anyone's lockmeter reports, so...
