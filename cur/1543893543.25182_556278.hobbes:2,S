Those paths are above the level where shm_get_policy() is called.
It may be that shm_get_policy() doesn't need to recapitulate them 
if it's only ever called through such codepaths. It's not clear to
me whether that's intended as an invariant or is coincidental and
not guaranteed for future callsites.
