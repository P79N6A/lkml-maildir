I snipped this off and executed it on both my machines.
Here are the results:

My tentative conclusion is that the mtu does nothing and the transfer
rate is rotten.
tcpdump shows that about every other packet is lost. Many more packets
are lost if I get any other traffic on the link. For instance, if
I ping a host (1-second pings), the data-flow disappears. Most all
packets time out and are re-sent. The ping response is in 700 to
900 ms and many are missing (18% packet loss). If there is no data
transfer, I can ping with no packet loss.
The ping transfer time on a quiet link is 190.0 ms with 8 data-bytes.
This does not compute. Ping flood with 8 data-bytes shows 54% data
loss. Ping flood with the standard 56 data bytes shows 100% data
loss.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
