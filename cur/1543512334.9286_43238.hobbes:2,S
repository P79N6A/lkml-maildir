Correct. But just since it shareds "helluva lot of basic design" is not reason
to share ALL BASIC DESIGN...

At least it was possible to open them as [almost] text file. There was inode
number and filename on each line. It was long, long ago.

Yes, and it's not good :-/ I wanted to mount my FAT partiton in two chroot'ed
environments and was unable to do such...

Great. Such problems should be and can be fixed before devfs will be accepted
(in 2.5.x -- it's to late for 2.3.x) even if they are not trivial. But looks
like you are the only one who cares about technical problems with devfs and
not political ones :-/ All other folks (including Theodore Y. Ts'o and
H. Peter Anvin) object against devfs IDEA, not against IMPLEMENTATION.
It' stupid to clean up implementation if something is rejected on bad idea
basis.

Misunderstanding. By "the only real problem" I mean "problems with VFS", not
"problems with rename".

It's still "problems with VFS".
AV> _Lack_ of rename() kinda sucks, but it's not a VFS problem per se.

And it's interesting question: is devfs the only filesystem with needs to be
mounted few times ?

Yes, this exactly type of problems where noone will object that problem exists
in first place and that it should be solved somehow. Unfortunatelly you are the
only one who raise such REAL problem with devfs. Most users are angry on IDEA
not IMPLEMENTATION :-/

Devfs is MUCH more then filesystem :-/ For better and for worse. fsdevel is
place to discuss interaction between devfs and VFS, races in devfs and so on.
But it's not all story with devfs ...
