What makes you think that?
% hdparm -I /dev/hda
non-removable ATA device, with non-removable media
        Model Number:           QUANTUM BIGFOOT_CY6480A
        Serial Number:          166702123281        
        Firmware Revision:      A03.0500

        r/w multiple sector transfer: Max = 32  Current = 32
        DMA: sdma0 sdma1 sdma2 mdma0 mdma1 *mdma2 
             Cycle time: min=120ns recommended=120ns
        PIO: pio0 pio1 pio2 pio3 pio4 
             Cycle time: no flow control=333ns  IORDY flow control=120ns
To me it seems to do multi sector transfers just fine. It does it even
better than the 60 GB IBM drive in this box which is much newer but
can do only 16 sectors.
	Regards
