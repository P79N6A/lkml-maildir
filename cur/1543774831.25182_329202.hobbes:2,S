This looks wrong:
> -#define GET_INDEX(a, b) ((((a) - PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_MCH_PA) << 3) + ((b) & 7))
> +#define GET_INDEX(a, b) PCI_DEVFN((a - PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_MCH_PA),b)
that first argument looks like it has parentheses at the wrong place, it 
should be
	(a) - PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_MCH_PA
rather than
	(a - PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_MCH_PA)
methinks.
Other than that... Greg?
