Hi all,
I have installed 2.6 kernel on my notebook and it seems that the kernel reports wrong CPU and bus frequency. My notebook is Acer TravelMate 361Evi, P-III Mobile CPU 1 GHz, and 133 MHz bus. The 2.6 kernel shows something like:
Jan 10 19:01:01 peorth kernel: Detected 1113.758 MHz processor.
...
Jan 10 19:01:01 peorth kernel: Calibrating delay loop... 1544.19 BogoMIPS
...
Jan 10 19:01:01 calibrating APIC timer ...
Jan 10 19:01:01 peorth kernel: ..... CPU clock speed is 1329.0639 MHz.
Jan 10 19:01:01 peorth kernel: ..... host bus clock speed is 177.0285 MHz.
For 2.4.x, they are:
Jan  9 14:29:00 peorth kernel: Detected 999.905 MHz processor.
...
Jan  9 14:29:00 peorth kernel: Calibrating delay loop... 1992.29 BogoMIPS
....
Jan  9 14:29:01 peorth kernel: calibrating APIC timer ...
Jan  9 14:29:01 peorth kernel: ..... CPU clock speed is 999.8676 MHz.
Jan  9 14:29:01 peorth kernel: ..... host bus clock speed is 133.3155 MHz.
I've tested this on 2.6.0-test11/2.6.0/2.6.1/2.6.1-mm1/2.6.1-mm2, none of them report the freq/bogomips near to those reported by 2.4.x. 
And, I'm not sure this is a related issue but, on 2.6 I got about 490 fps of glxgears, while I got about 600 fps on 2.4. hdparm -tT reports about the same for 2.4 and 2.6.
Any clue why 2.6 reports wrong freq ? Does this affect the performance/stability of the system, or else ? The system seems to run 2.6 without any other problems by the way.
Thanks in advance,
kitty
