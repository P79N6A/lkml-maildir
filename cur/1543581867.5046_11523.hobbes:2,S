Ok, it's not a cramfs.  If you disable cramfs, it will likely
work.  There seems to be a (init order?) problem when cramfs is
enabled.  For instance, if I enable cramfs here, my minix gzipped
initrd can not mount root.. kernel tries to use reiserfs instead
for some unknown reason.  I disable cramfs and all is well.
Since the error message you posted seems to be from cramfs...
