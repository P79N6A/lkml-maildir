also how many of the standard kernel features could you turn off?
do you really need filesystems for example?
could userspace be eliminated? (if you have some way to give the config
commands to the kernel on the NIC and get the log messages back to the
main kernel what else do you need?)
a lot of the other IO buffer stuff can be trimmed back (as per
config_embedded)
what else could be done to use the kernel features taht are wanted without
bringin extra baggage along?
