In theory we can kexec another kernel even in a kexeced kernel, that is,
in kernel A kexec kernel B, and in kernel B kexec another kernel C. In
this situation, both /proc/vmcore and /proc/kimgcore has valid contents.
So I think, it may be better to keep two interfaces.
In fact, current kexec jump implementation use a dummy "jump back helper
image" in kexeced kernel to jump back to the original kernel. The "jump
back helper image" has no PT_LOAD segment, it is used to provide a
struct kimage (including control page, swap page) and entry point to
jump back.
