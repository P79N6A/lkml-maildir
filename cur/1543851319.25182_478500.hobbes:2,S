Sorry, but I find this change a bit puzzling. The problem is particular to
the PPB on the HCA and not Altix. I can't see anywhere that a PCI Config Write
is required to block until completion, it is the driver and the HCA ,not the
Altix hardware that requires the Config Write to have completed before we
leave mthca_reset() Changing pci_write_config_xxx() will change the behavior
for ALL drivers and the possibility of breaking something else. The fix was
very low risk in mthca_reset(), changing the PCI code to fix this is much
more onerous.
I know you must feel like "piggy in the middle" with this, so I don't mean
to cause you any problems, but I guess I don't understand the reluctance for
the driver fix.
