[snip more of sd smoother than cfs report]
WINE is an interesting workload as it does most of its work out of
process to the 'wineserver', which then does more work out of process
to the X server. So, it's three mutually interacting processes total,
once one includes the original client (Unreal Tournament or World of
Warcraft, in this case).
Perhaps running one of the windows system performance apps (that can
be freely downloaded) under WINE would give some hard numbers people
could use to try to reproduce the report.
