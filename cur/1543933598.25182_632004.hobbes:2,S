Please fix your mailer to inline the patch, preferably without word
wrapping. This is not a difficult thing, send yourself some test mails
until you get it sorted out.

Superfluous whitespace.

Er, what? The size of this never changes, allocate it once, and just
overload it every time you step in to this function. There's no reason to
free it and reallocate every time. Shove it in your probe routine with
the rest of your kzallocs.

Having separate functions for these is pretty pointless.

This locking is all over the place. What is this lock supposed to be
accomplishing?
