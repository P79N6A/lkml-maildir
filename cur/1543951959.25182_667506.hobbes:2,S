Hmm, ok. I finally see your point. 
please allow me to make clarification
Background:
- reserve_bootmem is called for *reserve* memory before bootmem allocator.
- It specifies <address, size>.
- Because <addrees, size> are argments, memory hole in <address, size> is not
  problem here.
Before change,
- reseve_bootmem() only works for Node(0)
After change
- reserve_bootmem() works on sutiable nodes for <address, size>
- It can spread accross among prural nodes.
thank you for your work.
