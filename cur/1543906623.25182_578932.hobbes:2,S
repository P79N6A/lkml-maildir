The real question is WHY do people keep writing essays about topics that have 
_already_ been exhaustively explored in other threads? If you want a better 
understanding of the situation, read the archives, DON'T post another 
duplicate message about the same scheduler parade.
Unless you've got some constructive input that goes further than asking the 
same questions that have already been asked and answered multiple times 
before, please just do not pollute this list.
It's becoming so repetitive this almost sounds like a 419.
