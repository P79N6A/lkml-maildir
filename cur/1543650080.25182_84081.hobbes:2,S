64-bit time_t is nice because you don't *ever* need to worry about
overflow; it's capable of handling times on a galactic lifespan
scale.  It's overkill, of course, but it's the *right* kind of
overkill.
We probably need to revamp struct stat anyway, to support a larger
dev_t, and possibly a larger ino_t (we should account for 64-bit ino_t
at least if we have to redesign the structure.)  At that point I would
really like to advocate for int64_t ts_sec and uint32_t ts_nsec and
quite possibly a int32_t ts_taidelta to deal with leap seconds... I'd
personally like struct timespec to look like the above everywhere.
