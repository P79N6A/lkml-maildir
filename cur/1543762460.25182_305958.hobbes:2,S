Your statement is self contradictory.  How can you say there's no need
to use binary drivers if you don't know anything about the audio
support?  Many users consider sound a critical feature.
As a matter of fact there are a few quirks with the audio on Nvidia
chipsets, due to (surprise) lack of documentation.
