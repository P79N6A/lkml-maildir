OK, I don't advertise that I'm the "know-it-all" when it comes to security, 
and in the State of Nevada (USA) I'm not allowed to advertise as a 
"security consultant" without a special license from the Private 
Investigator's License Board.
I have a firewall running on 2.4.18 (Red Hat 7.3/Valhalla with updates) 
which is (on an experimental basis) doing port-number-based forwarding to a 
Web server.  The idea is that the Web server is *not* directly on the 'Net, 
but is instead  behind a firewall that steers incoming traffic to it on two 
specific ports:  80 and 443.  (Yes, I installed the slapper on the Web 
server.)  This was done using IPTABLES.
I've also been experimenting with the traffic limiting capabilities, as one 
co-locate provider offers discounts for guaranteed lower bandwidth 
utilization, so by limiting the bandwidth using IPTABLES I should be able 
to cut my co-lo costs to 1/3 of what they would be with "unlimited" bandwidth.
I've worked with the PIX, and I don't see what I'm missing in features 
between the PIX and Linux/IPTABLES.  I'm sure there is something.  Please 
amplify on your comments.
