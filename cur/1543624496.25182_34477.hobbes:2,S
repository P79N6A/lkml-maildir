I am sorry, but arguing over whether network filesystems have their 
functionality outside the filesystem is not an argument I respect enough 
to engage in.  Clearcase is a filesystem.  Views are built into the 
filesystem.
It has user space utilities.  It is still a filesystem despite having 
user space utilities, and its functionality is in the filesystem.
