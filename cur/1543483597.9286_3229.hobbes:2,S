Set the MTU/MSS on outgoing packets via your default route.  It works
fine for me -- without it, I see pMTU problems on the site you posted,
with it, I don't see the problems.  It doesn't hurt performance on
your local network, because it only affects packets bound for remote
networks.
I'm using ANK's iproute instead of ifconfig and route, but you should
be able to use either.  Here's my default route line from
/etc/init.d/network:
  ip route add default via 206.253.199.129 window 6000 mtu 576
I also dropped the window size to 6k, because large windows over slow
links can cause problems, particularly when dealing with Ascend's
flaky terminal servers.
