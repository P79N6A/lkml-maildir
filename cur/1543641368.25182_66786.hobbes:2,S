I didn't say an optional feature.  The filesystem may choose to use that
abstraction in a totally different way than the generic code.  An example
for such an filesystem is GFS.  Thus OpenGFS doesn't support loop devices
at all and sistina has tp provide workaround patches for their propritary
product.

See above.  Execpt of ->writepage which must be callable by the VM writeout
code filesystems may have totally different assumptions.  For a worst case
example look at the (Open-)GFS cluster filesystem.  For a not so bad example
look at XFS which does in theory require additional locking although this
doesn't seem exploitable in practice.

The end-user benefict is that a user can use the loop device omtop
of any filesystem without the danger of those races actually beeing exposed
for some random reason.

Yes, loop.c does grow.

I don't complain about your other changes.  These bugs were in before and
after your changes so I certainly do not blaim you.

Blarg.  If you care for performance encrypted loop is the last thing you want.

I don't care about loop.c, really.  And I don't plan to approve or reject
loop-specific patches.  I care about it's interaction with the VFS and
lowlevel filesystems.
