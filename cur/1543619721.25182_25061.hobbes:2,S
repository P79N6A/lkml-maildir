Well, all of the Intel i8XX chipsets have a harware RNG I believe.
There are even tools available to use them (gkernel.sf.net), but
it is not fed into the /dev/random entropy pool by default, and I
doubt that these tools are available with any distro.  At the
time, this decision was made because it is hard to determine what
the actual entropy of this device is.
Maybe, i8XX hardware RNG should feed the /dev/random entropy pool
directly if you enable the chipset support (with an option to turn
it off if you want to use the user-space tools or a separate RNG),
so that people get the benefits of the h/w RNG without having to
install another tool (which they won't know about)?
Cheers, Andreas
