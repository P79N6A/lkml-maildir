Basically what Paul Menage said. There is a lot of common code,
and you would end up writing X86 && X86_64 more often than
X86 && !X86_64.
In addition such a change is quite intrusive and I don't
think it's a good idea to do right now because it'll very
likely introduce bugs.
If someone really thinks the X86 && !X86_64 is too ugly
(I personally don't think it is because it says clearly
what the matter is) then adding an additional X86_32 would be the right
thing to do.
