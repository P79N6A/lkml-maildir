OK. I think in your case it's probably harmless. I thought
that two (order 1) 4K pages can hold 2000 4 byte group IDs,
and that "ought to be enough for anybody". If you envision
10,000 groups, then perhaps you are right, except that it may
be about time to think about your data structures a little more.
I'll let Andi to remind you about the performance impact (vmalloc
area is outside of the big TLB area).

The sad part is that the patch was around since 2000, but the
effort to get it in was a little half-hearted, perhaps.
I am thinking about reviving it.
