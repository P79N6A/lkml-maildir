Yes, it takes maybe a little while to sort out what the
driver model does for you, especially if you're coming
from whatever strange dimension the I2C model did.  :)

Well, I've just posted a sketch of how to use the driver
model in a more traditional way for SPI.  That same
approach could be taken with I2C if/when anyone gets
motivated to make it happen ... except that, unlike SPI,
I2C can actually use hardware probing in common usage.
(It could kick in right after the pre-declared devices
Get initialized.)
