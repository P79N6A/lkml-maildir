Basically, yes. However, I can tell you that directory name caching is 
damn hard, and the kernel does it better than anybody else. 
The hardest part of caching is not filling the cache - it's knowing when 
to release it. In other words, forget the filling part, and think about 
the replacement policy (balacing between the page cache, the directory 
cache, and regular pages). The kernel already has that.
Besides, I really think that we can do this with basically just a few 
lines of code in the kernel (apart from the actual case comparison, which 
I'm not even going to worry about - that's totally independent of the 
cache handling itself, and I don't care about how to write a 
"windows_equivalent_strncasecmp()".
