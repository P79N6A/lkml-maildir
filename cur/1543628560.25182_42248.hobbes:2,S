Subject: [PATCH] 2.5.9-dj1, add to help text in arch/s390/Config.help.

The following snippet is from arch/s390/config.in:
if [ "$CONFIG_IPL" = "y" ]; then
  choice 'IPL method generated into head.S' \
          "tape                   CONFIG_IPL_TAPE \
           vm_reader              CONFIG_IPL_VM" tape
fi
This patch adds help for the vm_reader choice option.
