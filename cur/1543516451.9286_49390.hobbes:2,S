That sounds consistant with having an error in try_to_free_buffers.
When that function is in trouble (or very heavily loaded), that
means that the machine is already tight on memory and bound to
have poor performance.
What we need to find out now is why things are going wrong and
how we can avoid both the oops and the slow performance. The
bug sounds *ahum* interesting, so we really should do something
about it...

I think Alan will be able to tell us if any changes to the locking
infrastructure or buffer cache have been integrated in 2.2.x that
could help fix this bug. There's quite a bit of pointer magic going
on in that part of the kernel, so every little thing could help :)

Hrmmm, it would help a lot if you could drag this numeric
oops through the ksymoops program to give us symbolic output :)
