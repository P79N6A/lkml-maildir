IANAL but AFAIK the GPL V2 requires you to either distribute the
source/patch together with the binary or include a *written* obligation
valid for three years to supply the sources to any thrid party.
So, for example, if you disribute the binary on a CD, or some embedded
device, sticking the patch somewhere on your web site with an obscure
link pointing to them is technicaly a violation of the GPL.
But as I said, this is just nitpicking... :-)
