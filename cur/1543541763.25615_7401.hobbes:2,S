Mostly because there exists a lot of backup tools that are hard to
replace.  If the rest of the company uses a backup server which
supports POSIX file systems you won't be very popular if you insist on
a special tool to back up your partitions, and lots of backup clients
aren't open source and thus can't be fixed.

Why change everything?  Inventing a new API means that _all_ tools
have to be rewritten to work with alternate streams.
