That's an interesting insight.  My intuition is that Nick Piggin's 
recently-posted ticket spinlocks patches[1] will reduce the need for this patch, 
though it may be useful to have both.  Can you benchmark again with only ticket 
spinlocks, and with ticket spinlocks + this patch?  You'll probably want to use 
2.6.24-rc1 as your baseline, due to the x86 architecture merge.
