After consulting with Rusty, I'm happy to present an initial cut at manpages
for Futexes in Linux 2.5.40 and onwards.
Please find DocBook, HTML and troff on 
http://ds9a.nl/futex-manpages
 and on
http://ds9a.nl/futex-manpages.tar.gz
Andries, please consider these for adoption.
Regards,
bert 'documentation gnome' hubert
