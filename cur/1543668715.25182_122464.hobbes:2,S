Yep, it appears to have PCI bus funnies too..

I'm compiling with rmb before the APIC EOI, which is after the local 
variable assignments (i'll post the results in a bit, slow build box).

I haven't actually seen anything mentioning writing to ICR 
having a serializing side effect. However the forced read around write 
with family < P6 (CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC) in Linux should ensure that no 
reads or writes pass the APIC/ICR write due to the xchg, however wether 
'implied' lock ensures that it's treated the same as implicit lock i don't 
know.

Wouldn't APIC writes be then treated differently on a P4 (which uses the 
system bus) and the P5/P6 which has it's own serial bus? Imo we should not 
rely on APIC loads/stores which is why i added an rmb after the APIC EOI 
for the rmb in smp_call_function_interrupt test.
