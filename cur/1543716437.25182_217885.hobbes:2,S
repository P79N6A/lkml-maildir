I use softlinks. It works 100%. I can run unlimited number
of NFS mounted diskless workstations. All of them have
ro root fs, can mount /usr ro or rw as needed.
/var, /tmp, /etc are always writable.
I use mount --bind for only one mountpoint,
everuthing else is handled by softlinks.
Why do you think it is not too nice?
