I have the following problem:
After configuring the Kernel 2.2.7 with
'make menuconfig'
I started to compile the kernel with
'make dep clean zImage'.
First it worked but in the end there was the following ERROR message:
init/main.o(.data.init+0x124): undefined reference to 'md_setup'
drivers/block/block(genhd.o): In function 'device_setup':
genhd.o(.text.init+0xfe): undefined reference to 'md_setup_drive'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
A second try had the same result.
I hope that someone can help me with my little problem.
Thanks in advance.
Greetings
