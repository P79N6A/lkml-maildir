	Hi.
	I have  VIA686a too and a UDMA100 hard disk.
	This is my cat /proc/ide/via:

	As you can see, l use UDMA66 instead UDMA100. I don't know why. Maybe VIA vt82c686a doesn't support it? I have answering in this list a days ago about this problem. but none seems to have a question. Like you, my system goes down when I try to compile something (I have a 394 Mb of RAM and a 1 Ghz processor).
	Although, my hdparm output is this:
	/dev/hde2:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.79 seconds =162.03 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.44 seconds = 26.23 MB/sec
	and sometime looks better.
	I don't know is this is a problem with the VIA kernel driver or not. But the system doesn't seem to work fine since 2.4.2 or 2.4.1 kernel. I hope (plz!) this problem will be fixed in future.
	Luck.
	PS: in cat /proc/ide/via I see "Cable Type:                   40w                 40w"... Is it right? I have a 80w cable, not 40.
