Heh. I wish. But if that's the end result, we've done something good.

Bingo.

We've disabled IO and MEM behind this bridge - the one that bridges to 
secondary bus 0x0e.
And your tg3 device? It's at 0000:0e:00.0. Yeah. Exactly the bus that 
we've disabled IO and MEM for.
In other words, it was never your tg3 suspend/resume that was buggy. It 
was the suspend/resume for the PCI-E port driver. In fact, I think it's 
_exactly_ the issue I just emailed out about.
I bet Rafael can whip up a patch in a minute. I have too much of a 
headache right now to look at my screen for a while, so I'll take a break.
