you mean why in the normal, linear mapping case? No reason, just for
testing. At zap-time we could test whether that pte is linear or not, and
only store it in the swap entry as a file-pte if it's nonlinear.
for swappable sys_file_remap_pages() support it's necessary though, as
they break up the linear mapping without splitting up the vma into
zillions of pieces.
