I don't know the details, but PPP didn't work for me anymore after
upgrading to 2.3.14. I then upgraded the ppp package to the version
mentioned in Documentation/Changes, and after that it worked again.
I noticed that the new pppd created the device /dev/ppp on the first
invocation. Apparently, that device is now needed.
