Odd.  The last time I looked into this, it acted as if it was locking over
NFS.  I ran one little Perl program on the Alpha, and a second on an AIX
NFS client machine.  It certainly acted as if they were respecting each
other's flock().  And, yes, I checked the Perl sources.  It's definitely
using flock().
