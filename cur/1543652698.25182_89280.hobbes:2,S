The current method is that on "make install" the module-init-tools
move the old ones to xxx.old (if they exist), and do a backwards
compat check every time they start (and execvp xxx.old on every older
kernel).  If it doesn't work for you, please report.
To package them, the distros will probably hack modutils into
module-init-tools/old or something and make them install themselves as
xxx.old automatically.  Code apprediated.

Yes, I've been distracted, sorry.  I only implemented i386, ia64,
sparc, sparc64, ppc and ppc64 (some untested in-kernel, but linking
logic works).  I have access to an Alpha, but work has stopped while I
try to keep up with everything else.  RTH can probably complete it in
a fraction of the time I could anyway.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
