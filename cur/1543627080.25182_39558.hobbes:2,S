  At one point Alan posted "I actually run my kernels" and I think that's
important. In some cases they contain perfectly stable features which are
not in the mainline for... I don't want to say "political reasons," but
reasons of policy rather than technical issues. I have run production on
rmap and O(1) for a while, but they seem destined to stay in 2.5 near
term.
  The -ac has the new ServerRAID driver from IBM. Since I have systems
using the hardware which are timezones away, anything which tends to
stability is good in my use. New firmware means new drivers (often) and
the IBM update CD has a binary module only. I'll try the pre5-ac3 instead.
