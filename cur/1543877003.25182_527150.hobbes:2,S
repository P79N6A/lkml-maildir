There might be a lot of applications like that, and I'm not sure that 
_all_ of them can be considered 'stupid' as you say.
How about applications that perform mmap() and R/W random-access on 
large *sparse* files? (e.g. a scientific app that uses a large sparse 
file as a big database look-up table). As I see it, these apps would
need to keep track of what's sparse and what's not...
