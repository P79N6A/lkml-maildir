the above is trivially easy.  an in core map can be kept of what cookie goes in what
jar.  on shutdown, that map is flushed to the appropriate file.
this is the same approach taken for quotas and has been requested for network
routing/config/firewall, etc.

and neatly allows users to manage policy in userland where policy should be dictated.

reference above in core map.  if it was used before, it can be plopped into the right
place automatically.  if not, config policy dictates the next slot to fill, or to
request the user to advise.
all in all, it seems that this scheme makes things wonderfully managable and usable.
i can now plug/unplug a particular usb mouse and plug it back in in any other port
and have it come back as it's supposed to.  truely transparent for users.  should
policy place something in jar A and the user wants it in jar B, they can (warning!
GUI enhanced example!) pop up their little management interface and drag it from jar
A to jar B and the in core mapping is updated appropriately.
