I think you are a bit confused.  Of course the USB Host controller
devices support DMA, that's how things are set up and work properly
without using a ton of CPU.  They are usually PCI devices and work quite
well and use DMA.
It's the USB devices themselves that don't and can't do any DMA
themselves.
Hope this helps explain things.
