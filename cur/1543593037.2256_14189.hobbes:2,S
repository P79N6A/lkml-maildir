Don't forget to bug RH package maintainer on that. Whatever 
version they ship (I don't know, maybe 13 indeed didn't have -k) 
the mans and the binaries must be consistent. 
I use source-built cscope v.15.1, and -k works for me here, 
atop RH70 too. You can download it 
at 
http://cscope.sourceforge.net
 And, the cscope project
guys are very responsive and willing to fix/implement things
in their product. 
(BTW, anyone here knows how to submit
a cvsweb patch/bug and get an answer? cvsweb at sourceforge
seems dead, as well as cvsweb.org :-( )
You definitely want -k in the kernel Makefile to avoid 
irrelevant things from /usr/include!!!

Sorry for being unclear. I meant: output the new find results into smth like
.cscope.files, then compare (cmp -s) it to the current cscope.files,
and replace the latter with it ONLY if there were diffs:

WHY?! Isn't it better to put $(shell cat cscope.files) on the list of
cscope.out
dependencies? Or, maybe better yet,
cscope.make: cscope.files
	echo -n 'cscope.out: ' > .$@
	cat $< >> .$@	
	mv .$@ $@
include cscope.make
(or should it be `-include' here?)
