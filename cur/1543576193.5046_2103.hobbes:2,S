Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Axel,
	The following patch to the help section for appletalk.o:
  * Updates a reference URL to a permanent (non-employer dependent) location. 
The old URL has been redirecting here for a while.
  * Explains why you'd be crazy to not compile appletalk as a module.
  I attempted to align the word wrapping to account for the difference in text
size.
