Patrick,
The technique of supporting REPORT_LUNS on lun 0 of
a target in the case where there is no such device
(logical unit) is a pretty ugly. It also indicates what
is really happening: the target device intercepts
REPORT_LUNS, builds the response and replies on behalf
of lun 0.
Turns out there are other reasons an application may want
to "talk" to a target device rather than one of its logical
units (e.g. access controls and log pages specific to
the target's transport). Well known lus can be seen with the
REPORT_LUNS (select_report=1) but there is no mechanism (that
I am aware of) that allows anyone to access them
from the user space with linux.
