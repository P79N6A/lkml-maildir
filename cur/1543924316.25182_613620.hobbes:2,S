To which extent do you need IEEE 1394 drivers?

Uh oh...
I'm afraid the ieee1394 core's own scatter-gather list managing code
didn't survive the changes in the kernel's s/g list implementation.
Alas I will be quite busy with non-Linux related stuff during at least
the next two weeks and can't fix this myself for now.
