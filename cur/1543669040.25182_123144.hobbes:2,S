Which simply shows that an entry in the MAINTAINERS file does not a
maintainer make, since your first post showed such misundestanding of
what personalities do, and you've let the 2.4 and 2.5 personality
lists get out of sync.
Qemu could hack it into all the stat, stat64, open, chmod, chown,
link, rename etc. calls in the emulator, yes, but the in-kernel
solution already exists and is far simpler.

I happens, though, whatever you may think.  It was done as a 2.4 patch
because there's a tighter time constraint on entry into 2.4.

This is not qemu specific, of course.  If you say it's not going in,
then I'll accept that and do the work inside qemu.  It'll be damn
slow, of course.
Thanks,
Rusty.
