Yes that would be nice. But the lifebook-touchscreen hardware is also
used in other notebooks. For example the Panasonic Toughbook CF28. But
we could still use DMI to check whether we are on a lifebook b-series
and then initialize the hardware. This would still get 95% of all cases.
For all the other ones we would have to provide some kind of
force-switch.
