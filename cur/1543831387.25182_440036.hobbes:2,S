I just noticed yesterday that Stelian sent a patch to lkml in May. My
work is based on his separate driver from his website.
Given the fact that my driver includes all of his functionality and that
replacing his with mine later in the process would mean to remove whole
files again, I'd suggest to wait until I've fixed the outstanding issues
(as seen in this thread) and then to merge mine.
Greets,
Michael
