yes, i understand what he wanted now.  as a first step (that
theoretically shouldn't change any behaviour), i'd patch the Kconfig
structure to add a new attribute ("maturity") which would be allowed
to be set to *exactly one* of a pre-defined set of values (say,
OBSOLETE, DEPRECATED, EXPERIMENTAL, and STILLBLEEDING).  and that's
it, nothing more.
don't try to do anything with any of that just yet, just add the
infrastructure to support the (optional) association of a maturity
level with a config option.  that's step one.
rday
p.s.  and, yes, i really meant it when i said that an option could
have one, and *only* one, maturity level.  if you start arguing
this point, i swear, i will hunt you down and give you *such* a
wedgie.
