You shouldn't need that.

This will cause an oops if it gets woken by a signal -- you leave and the 
the 'struct erase_info' on your stack frame, which you passed to the 
asynchronous erase call, goes bye bye.

Oh, I see -- if we fail to find a file system we recognise on the NOR

No, although the fix I'm happy with is going to take a while to get

other grounds anyway; perhaps separate it and don't submit it for inclusion 
just now?
