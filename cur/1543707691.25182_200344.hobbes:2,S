Well, we do. The pcibios_xxx routines get called for all PCI devices 
during discovery, and that's when you'd fill them in.
Anyway, I found the bug - the "asm-generic/dma-mapping.h" compatibility 
macros _do_ work, but the EHCI controller driver doesn't actually include 
that header file. Oops.

No no. That wouldn't work AT ALL, since the whole point is that you need 
to know what the device is - ie you need to fill in the information when 
you get the "struct pci_dev *" (because different buses would most likely 
have different behaviour, and could have different requirements for DMA 
mapping etc). 
So the platform code that actually knows what the device is (pcibios_xxx 
for PCI devices) would fill in the platform pointer.
Anyway, I got it all working with the trivial patch..

so this works for now, even though it's really really ugly (and it _will_
BUG() out if anybody ever passes a non-PCI-related "struct device" to the
thing).
Let's see if it boots too. So far it's only compiled successfully ;)
