Yes it will, unless you suspect the assembler to get it wrong which is
highly unlikely. All compiler bugs I have ever seen have been quite well
visible in the .S assembler file.
The .S file is the only easy way to find out which the faulting
instruction from the oops output is and once you know the instruction you
reverse compile to know which C statement it was and once you know that
you know which variable was NULL/random value and then you can start
looking for the answer to "how the fsck did that happen?"... (-; At least
I have managed to find and fix quite a few bugs using that approach
before. But without the .S file + oops output it is impossible to do as my
compiler/.config would mean the oops output is not too useful in
combination with my own .S file...
Cheers,
