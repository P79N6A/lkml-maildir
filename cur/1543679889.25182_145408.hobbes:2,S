    Okay, so the question as I see it is this:
    Do we go back to use_10_for_ms = 0 for the default,
    or do we make the IMM driver set it to 0 in the
    slave_configure() function?
I agree completely - that is the question.
The answer I gave is
  -       sdev->use_10_for_ms = 1;
  +       sdev->use_10_for_ms = 0;
  It is possible to have use_10_for_ms == 1 as the default, but then
  all drivers that cannot handle that must change that setting privately.
  Maybe that is the future, but for today I would prefer
  the known working version.
