1)
I noticed that when I booted linux on a diskless machine (well, it has a
floppy only) that bootp/rarp will timeout after so much time and give up. 
How about a config option to not timeout (and not change query times)?  I
modified the ipconfig.c (right one, I forgot) to force it not to timeout and
no higher delays.
2)
W/O changing nfsroot.c (or .h, I forget where it was, I did these mods a few
months ago) there's no way to change the default nfsroot mount point.
(Would be nice if it would retry if it gets an error from the server.  This
one I haven't figured out yet <g>).
Anyone else use diskless machines like this?  Here's what I usually do:
make my modifications (2 files), compile what I need, rdev zImage /dev/nfs
and then write it to a floppy (using cp zImage /dev/fd0).  Much easier than
using other boot loaders (ok, so I can't pass parameters, but that's ok =)
