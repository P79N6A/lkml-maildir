This is true. Unfortunatelly the following somewhat shorter sentence is true
as well: "NO kernels are safe". Even if we'll include non-linux ones. Yes,
unfiltered HDIO_DRIVE_CMD making it easier but you can do it all without kernel
help you are root (Administrator in case of Windows) - not exactly without
kernel help but rather you'll just fix kernel so it'll help you :-) You can
remove any such filtering via /dev/kmem and I do not think code of exploit
will be significally bigger in such case.

What I CAN NOT understood is WHAT you want to do ? If you want prevent
accidental damage then yes, it can be done. If you want to block mailicous
user then no you can not do it: it's not that hard to remove filtering from
running lernel with help of /dev/kmem ...

If it's "best point" then I REALLY glad Linus does not buy such "best point".
We still have hope then...
