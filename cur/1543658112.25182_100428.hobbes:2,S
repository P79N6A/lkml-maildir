What is the status of dmfs going into mainline?
I saw that Greg KH posted a patch with some corrections to dmfs for
2.5.50?
IMO it would be nice to have a kernel config option that makes the
ioctl method optional when dmfs is set to y or m in kernel config.
That will not only save a bit of code space, but it will also serve to
encourage use of dmfs.  :)
