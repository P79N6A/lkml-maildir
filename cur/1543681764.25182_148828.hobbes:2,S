FWIW, this also affects PPP over an async serial line (in my case to a 
56Kb modem).  During cdparanoia runs, the modem Tx/Rx lights all but 
stop as the missed packets drop retransmissions into the minute+ 
timeframe.  (Oddly, I don't recall seeing framing errors from ifconfig; 
must be the lower level ppp substrate or some such...)
I can confirm this with 2.4.20, am mostly certain it affects 2.4.21 
(will have to retest to be sure).  Similarly to Dave, I'm using an 
IDE/ATAPI burner with both DMA and UNMASKIRQ enabled.
