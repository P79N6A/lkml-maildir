Actually, forking is not really that bad of an idea.  When I took over 
tftp, for example, I just did it and called it tftp-hpa.  It didn't take 
very long before I got a message from the netkit maintainer asking if I 
was planning to continue, and if so if he could drop tftp from netkit.
A similar thing happened when Jeremy (and now Ian) took over autofs from me.
Forking gets your new maintainership proven *before* you end up taking 
over.  On the other hand, magicfilter effectively died when I handed it 
over to someone who didn't do a good job with it.
