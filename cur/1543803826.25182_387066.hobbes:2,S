Well, I sorta broke my never build an -rc1 rule.
It seems to be stable so far, but I have a cx88 based video card, a 
pcHDTV-3000, and there's 2 problems with the audio.  That dma function 
was turned off in the .config as the lspci -n didn't report the right 
numbers.
1. tvtimes volume control has no effect, in kamix, its now the 'front' 
slider.  Its actually plugged into the line in jack of a SBLive Audigy 
2 Value card.
2. The audio has a definite 'dragging voice coil' sound, very tiresome 
to listen to, highly clipped regardless of the gain settings.
Since I do watch tv on this box, I'll go back to 2.6.15.1 until -rc2 is 
released.

People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word

stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
