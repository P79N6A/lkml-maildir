Have you tried to recompile with a different default?
Look at <linux/console_struct.h>, and change the line
	#define CUR_DEFAULT CUR_UNDERLINE
to e.g.
	#define CUR_DEFAULT CUR_BLOCK

True - it is obtained by hardware reprogramming. But having lots of programs
touch the hardware is getting less popular.
Concerning your 1. - You know that such an echo actually creates the VC?
I still recall the times that there was not enough memory for more than
four or five VCs, but probably you don't mind wasting a few hundred kB.
