thanks again for running the above benchmarks.

Second that of course, btw, the detailed explanataion of the changes I
did while merging it can be found on lse-tech.
it is also possible HZ/50 is too high frequency still, I didn't run any
extensive test on the reprogramming frequency. I would suggest to try
with HZ/10 too (so every 100msec instead of every 20msec).
BTW, the very same algorithm should also be shared by alpha, alpha never
had hardware irq balancing support, it's like a p4, and we do static
routing distribution choosed by the kernel at boot which is been pretty
good so far (better than mainline 2.4 on a p4 smp) but the irqblanace
algorithm should be better there too.
