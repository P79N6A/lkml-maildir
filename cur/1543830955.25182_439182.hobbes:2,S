Which would be why I wont move from 2.6.16.x for my servers unless I
really, really, really have to. I don't know how many broken sites are
out there and I cannot tell.
Another datapoint to this is that I've had this my netcat web test
running since 8:42pm yesterday. It's 8:37am now. It hasn't progressed
in any way. It hasn't quit. It hasn't timed out. It just sits there,
hung. This leads me to consider the possibility of a DOS, either
intentional or accidental (think about 2.6.17.x running on a mail server
and someone mails/spams from a broken place).
