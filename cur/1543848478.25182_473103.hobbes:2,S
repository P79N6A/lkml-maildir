Ugly but I don't think the patches are sufficient. Firstly you need to
hold the task lock if you are poking around some other users ->signal,
or that may itself change. (disassociate_ctty seems to have this wrong)
Secondly you appear to have lock ordering issues (you lock tty_mutex in
both orders relative to the task list lock) (you take tty_mutex first,
then the task lock which is correct, but then you drop and retake the
tty_mutex while holding the task lock, which may deadlock)
Can you also explain why the ctty change proposed is neccessary ?
NAK the actual code, provisionally agree with the basic diagnosis of
insufficient locking.
