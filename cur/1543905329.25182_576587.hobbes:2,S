I finally got around to testing this, and while I still have problems with 
that reader, I can't reproduce the oops with that patch in place either.
Of course, I only ever saw the oops once, so I really don't know how 
reproducible it was. Maybe you have to remove the USB reader at _just_ the 
right moment. But I did get
	...
	usb 2-6: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 4
	usb 2-6: USB disconnect, address 4
	sd 6:0:0:1: [sdc] Result: hostbyte=0x07 driverbyte=0x00
	end_request: I/O error, dev sdc, sector 1999855
	...
	scsi 6:0:0:1: rejecting I/O to dead device
so the testing was done with the kind of behaviour that resulted in an 
oops and a dead khubd last time around.
So I guess I'll ack the patch for whatever that is worth.
Over to you, Greg..
