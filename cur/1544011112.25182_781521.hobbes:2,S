Hi,
I'm getting messages similar to: 
FPU emulator: unknown prefix byte 0x00,
FPU emulator: probably due to self-modifying code (emulation impossible)
FPU ........: internal error type 0x0126
At 00000017:0000
 SW: b=1 st=0 es=1 sf=1 cc=0010 ef=111111
 CW: ic=0 rc=00 pc=11 ien=0     ef=111111
(I cut-pasted the above from something I found on google, relating
to 2.4.7, where the FPU emulator was fixedin 2.4.8. 
In my case "internal error" was 126, just like in '2001, In
my case I have "at 17:0", wwhereas in '01 it was reported "at
23:206". And the formatting changed a bit, which I corrected. 
I don't have all the different flags available. If this doesn't
provide enough hints, I'll have to figure those out fro you again.
I'm trying to set up a thin client, which runs on a geode, which
apparently doesn't have a FPU.... (/proc/cpuinfo mentions the flag 
"fpu", what does THAT mean?)
Oh, it seems as if some "state" is involved. booting init=/bin/bash
works, but allowing the system to boot a bit further leads to the
login shell (/bin/bash) getting killed due to the FPU emulator 
problem.... 
	Roger.

Q: It doesn't work. A: Look buddy, doesn't work is an ambiguous statement. 
Does it sit on the couch all day? Is it unemployed? Please be specific!
