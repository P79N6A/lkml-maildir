Sorry.  Per your suggestion in the review of our Calgary IOMMU code, I
tried to use the alloc_bootmem_nopanic that you recently added.
Unfortunately, it needs low mem for our translation tables, so we needed
a new function to do this.  
Aside from Calgary, I have updated swiotlb to take advantage of this new
function (amongst other clean-ups and refinements).  I'll push those
swiotlb patches out today.
Thanks,
Jon
