There hasn't been any further comments on this - I'm guessing it's ready to go.
Andrew can you take this  ??

The following patch adds driver support for a 2 port PCI IOC3-based
serial card on Altix boxes:

This is a re-submission. On the original submission I was asked to
organize the code so that the MIPS ioc3 ethernet and serial parts could
be used with this driver. Stanislaw Skowronek was kind enough to
provide the shim layer for this - thanks Stanislaw. This patch includes
the shim layer and the Altix PCI ioc3 serial driver. The MIPS merged
ioc3 ethernet and serial support is forthcoming.
