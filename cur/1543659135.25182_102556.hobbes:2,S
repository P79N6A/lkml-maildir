2.5.54 works, but since the bug in 2.5.55/.56 is dependent on
kernel size, and since I couldn't find anything in patch-2.5.55
to explain the change in behaviour, I suspected that the bug has
been around a bit longer: I just didn't manage to trigger it.
mem=nopentium made no difference for the other machine: it still
managed to boot the same kernel the 486 failed to boot.
However, with the patch to one_page_table_init() that Brian Gerst
posted earlier today (included below), my 486 boots 2.5.56 Ok.
