If you locked pages that have active shadow mappings, you could then use 
a secondary mechanism to invalidate existing mappings when necessary.
You could even base this on a user-configurable heuristic (give this VM 
1G of memory, with 512MB of dedicated memory for instance).
I seem to recall some discussion about having a memory pressure 
notification mechanism.  If such a thing existed, this could be used to 
reduce the guests actual memory foot print.  I'm woefully ignorant 
though of any recent developments in this area...
