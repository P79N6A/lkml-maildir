I agree with Dan.
I think I'd rather see the calls to usermode deleted
instead of extended -- unless there is a reason that
the general event -> acpid method can't work.
If the administrator screws up and disables shutdown
on critical temp, modern hardware will throttle
(in hardware), and if that too fails, it will shut
itself off.
