I'm really in favor of this, and had actually started an implementation a 
while back.  At the time, I posted a different version that added yet another 
semaphore but simplified the rest of the locking (and held no locks during 
the dio/aio).
I'll try to dig up my original radix tagging code.  I'm not sure if I kept it, 
but it did pass Daniel's dio vs buffer io racing tests at the time.
