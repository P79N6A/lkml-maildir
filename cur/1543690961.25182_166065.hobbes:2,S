A possible, but not very efficient workaround is to reserve memory or 
swap just for this condition. Obviously this limits available memory for 
other process (which in theory could cause an OOM in the first place) 
and would be wasted most of the time. Possibly this reserved memory 
would be used as a filesystem read cache until OOM, when it would be 
cleared out and used for whatever.
