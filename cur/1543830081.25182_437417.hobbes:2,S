arch/i386/kernel/entry.S has the macro BUILD_INTERRUPT(name, nr).
The code that uses this macro is in arch/i386/mach-*/entry_arch.h.
The macro prepends "smp_" to the name passed to the macro and the
generated asm code calls that function after saving registers, etc.
arch/i386/kernel/apic.c::apic_intr_init() calls set_intr_gate() to
point some of the interrupt gates at the correct functions.
