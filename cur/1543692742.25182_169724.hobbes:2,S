Yes i make it))Kernel comile and modules was done (make modules after
that make modules_install)And than reboot....
But after that I type insmod <module_name> and I see on a screen a
LITTLE warning (fatal error) that talk to me module can be load to the
kernel becouse it have old format))
I think than I must look for modutils (witch can support kernell 2.6 new
modules format) but I can't find it...
