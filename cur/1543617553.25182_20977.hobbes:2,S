we pass pointers across functions regularly, even if the pointer could be
calculated within the function. We do this in the timer code too. It's
slightly cheaper to pass an already existing (calculated) 'current'
pointer over to another function, instead of calculating it once more in
that function. This will be especially true once we make 'current' a tiny
bit more expensive (Alan's kernel stack coloring rewrite will do that i
think, it will be one more instruction to get 'current'.)

yes - would it be perhaps cleaner then to name the variable 'this_task' or
something like that?

no good reason, the macro started out being simple, but then grew in size
significantly, as the sophistication and correctness of the O(1) scheduler
improved ;-)
