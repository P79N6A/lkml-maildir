I wouldn't push for it too much tho. It's perfectly fine to have
"helpers" generate xx_platform from the device-tree. Since I added the
generic dev_archdata to struct device, it's easy for the arch to keep
track of OF devices for anything, it doesn't have to be an of_platform
device or anything like that anymore.
One of the things I have in mind is to provide a way to register
"constructors" that are based on an OF match set. Those would then be
called by the arch code for every OF node that matches, and would then
"construct" the appropriate linux device. Could be some kind of platform
device, could even be PCI devs.
