The only example of that type in the example I provided is SLPB, where the
sysfs node is ACPI-internal; I'm not sure how one can detect such cases.

Well, PNP courtesy of a previous patch from me, but remember that I was
using that as an example of a ** BOGUS ACPI TABLE ** as summarized above.
In my observation, such bogus tables are common.  (This particular one
was, I believe, copied from a system using a higher end version of the
same southbridge ... but which may well have had its own errors.)

For wakeup devices, the main issue I've seen is with button devices.
In my limited set of test sytems, everything else is either PCI, PNP,
or a bug (listing a non-existent device).
If this patch starts to get deployed, I expect other people will find
a few other curiousities ... and likely some things to be fixed.
The /sys/devices/acpi_system:00/ tree is kind of new.  I suspect one
way it could be more informative is to set up cross-links in sysfs
between the ACPI devices and the "real" device nodes ... e.g. on the
system I'm using right now .../device:00/PNP0A03:00/device:15/PNP0B00:00
could have a link pointing to /sys/devices/pnp0/00:06 ... and that PNP
node in turn could have an "acpi" link pointing back to the ACPI thing.
Such cross-links would let people see those relationships, and observe
which links are missing or otherwise strange.  Fixing the bugs would
seem unlikely until those things become visible.
