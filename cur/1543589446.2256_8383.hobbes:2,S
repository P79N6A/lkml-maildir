Did you reconfigure and rebuild bash on your machine running the 2.4
kernel, or just use a bash binary built on a previous kernel version?
Bash has an autoconf test that will, if it detects the need to do so,
force the job control code to synchronize between parent and child
when setting up the process group for a new pipeline.  It may be the
case that you have to reconfigure and rebuild bash to enable that code.
Look for PGRP_PIPE in config.h.
