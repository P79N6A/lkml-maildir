An updated version of the pluggable cpu scheduler framework is available 
for 2.6.10-rc2-mm1
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/plugsched/2.6.10-rc2-mm1/
The main changes in this version are a more robust version of minisched 
and the addition of "nanosched".
Nanosched is a minimal uniprocessor non preemptive scheduler with no 
priority support at all for the smallest environments.
Peter Williams is working on sharing more code between schedulers and 
Chris Han has a working sysfs interface to the scheduler tunables that I 
will be looking at merging in some form in the near future (thanks).
Cheers,
Con
