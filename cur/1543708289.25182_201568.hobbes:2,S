Good to split things into chunks so that it is more manageable for
review
by the Linux community. 
Hardware drivers coming soon.
I saw an email on the InfiniBand sourceforge list 
a couple weeks back that the Mellanox people will be providing open
source code 
for their InfiniBand hardware pretty soon. It may need some rework to
meet the 
standards of the Linux community and fit into the reworked IBAL. I also
saw 
a note from a guy from Fujitsu on the Infiniband list 
that they have a 2.6 hardware driver for IBAL for their HCA, but I am
not 
sure of their open source plans. 
Pretty soon, I don't think people will need worry about a lack of
InfiniBand open 
source code. There may be more of it than you will want to deal with. 
BTW. The patch on sourceforge should be OK now. My error on initial
upload
and now fixed.
