Hello.

Could you please try to read the same CD-R with kernel 2.4.18? If you
still can't read the CD, try with kernel 2.4.17, and so on back to
2.2.20, so we have a chance to find the change causing the problem. (Be
careful to skip problematic kernels, 2.4.15 and 2.4.11 come to mind.)
(Note also that a dicotomic search may be more efficient. I let you
decide.)
