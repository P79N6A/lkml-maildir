Hi, I have a small pb :
[1.] parallel port not recognized
[2.] the module parport is loaded but /dev/lp* are not recognized
althought other versions of kernel do recognize it (in printtool of
redhat for example)
[3.] modules, parport, printer
[4.] 2.2.0
[5.] no output
[6.] ...
[7.1] output of ver_linux
[romain@gimpy romain]$ ./ver_linux 
-- Versions installed: (if some fields are empty or looks
-- unusual then possibly you have very old versions)
