The Linux.Org folks asked me to do this to help smooth some very ruffled
feathers.
I want to apologize to the Linux folks for getting into the biggest
pissing match of all time with Gerard Roudier over the design of the
buffer cache.  I realize that folks have a lot of pride in their work,
and I can get overly-agressive.  I want everyone to realize however,
that I am a part of the Linux community now, and plan to be long term,
so I will try to note be so overly-agressive and condescending.  Like
the rest of you, I am trying to put out complex technology and sometimes
forget that others are not as direct and aggressive.  I sincerely
apologize to all of you and will try to do better in the future.
If it helps folks understand why I'm this way, I am the 1-27 million --
I am a double YY chromosone male, which is why I am overly agressive
with others.  Throw some water on me to cool things down if they get too
heated.  
Faithfully yours,
The guy putting NDS and Netware stuff on Linux.
Jeff Merkey
