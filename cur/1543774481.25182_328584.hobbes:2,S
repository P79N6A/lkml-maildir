I saw the note about this on suspend2.net but, for whatever reason,
read it as "add this to your hibernate script." So I incorrectly added
the above lines to /usr/local/sbin/hibernate. Durrr.

I think I had compiled lzh as a module so this was also causing
problems. Since I compiled lzh (and some of the others that looked
like fun) into the kernel and added the above lines to
/etc/hibernate/hibernate.conf, hibernation seems to be working better.
I'll have to play with it some more so it breaks.

Unfortunately, it did.
