I think you really need to come up with a better justification than "I
think this will be useful" for a permanent user-space ABI change.
What problem are you trying to solve, why is that a problem, how does
making PMC0 always be a cycle counter solve that, what makes you think
that future CPUs will have the same type of cycle counter that behaves
the same way as the current cycle counters, etc.
AFAICT, the problem you're trying to solve is two-fold:
a) RDTSC is serializing and RDPMC isn't.
Which is nicely solved by RDTSCP.
and
b) RDTSC isn't well defined.
Well, RDPMC isn't defined at all. You're assuming that future processor
revisions will have the same or substantially similar PerfCtrs as
current processors, and nothing guarantees that at all.
