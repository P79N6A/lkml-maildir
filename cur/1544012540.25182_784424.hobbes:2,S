Now, keep in mind this is only true for headers exported to userspace.
But this is correct - which is the base of this conversation (Sam
suggesting that they should be warned about, and I suggested
auto-converting them.)

This is also correct, at least for exported headers.  For
kernel-internal headers, it doesn't matter.  Unfortunately we do have at
least several cases of exported interfaces with globally visible names.
There is one other exception of note, which is a header file which can
only be included by the userspace *application*, using a nonportable
top-level include (either directly <linux/*> or indirectly via <sys/*>).
 In those cases we can be looser about at least structure names.  This
is common for ioctl structures.
