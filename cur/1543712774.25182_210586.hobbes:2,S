I can make sure that ACPI checks implicitly or explicitly
that CMPXCHG is available -- but I can't make sure that
some other random part of the kernel which may not have
been written yet does.  So I'd rather that they not build,
like ACPI didn't.
BTW. CMPXCHG (486 and above) doesn't seem to be in CPUID,
CMPXCHG8B is, but that starts with Pentium and above.
Maybe simpler to rely on the implicit "check" that we
did in previous releases...  Earliest known ACPI
implementation as on Pentium-1.
cheers,
