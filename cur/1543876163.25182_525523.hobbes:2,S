  which differs from the way it's handled with x86_64.  even though
the actual crypto routines specific to x86_64 are in
arch/x86_64/crypto (as they are with s390), the menuconfig selections
for them are defined in the *generic* crypto/Kconfig file:
...
config CRYPTO_TWOFISH_X86_64
        tristate "Twofish cipher algorithm (x86_64)"
        depends on (X86 || UML_X86) && 64BIT
        select CRYPTO_ALGAPI
        select CRYPTO_TWOFISH_COMMON
        help
          Twofish cipher algorithm (x86_64).
          Twofish was submitted as an AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
          candidate cipher by researchers at CounterPane Systems.  It is a
          16 round block cipher supporting key sizes of 128, 192, and 256
          bits.

  a little consistency would be nice.  :-)
