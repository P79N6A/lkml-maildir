Does the following imply that handling of ISA memory space will now be
different across architectures?  ie. don't ioremap ISA space on x86, but
do ioremap it on Alpha?
From include/asm-i386/io.h in 2.3.23 pre5:
+/*
+ * ISA space is 'always mapped' on a typical x86 system, no need to
+ * explicitly ioremap() it. The fact that the ISA IO space is mapped
+ * to PAGE_OFFSET is pure coincidence - it does not mean ISA values
+ * are physical addresses. The following constant pointer can be
+ * used as the IO-area pointer (it can be iounmapped as well, so the
+ * analogy with PCI is quite large):
