(this is against linux-2.4.10-ac8, but should apply to kernels
with similar usb drivers, too)
The casio qv-4000 digital cameras needs the same workarounds
in usb-storage as older casio cameras, but has a different
serial number. Therefore the attached patch is needed to make
the camera work - otherwise, I get a lot of 
"usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout" messages and the device doesn't work.
I think these are the corresponding lines in /proc/bus/usb/devices:
T:  Bus=01 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=00 Cnt=01 Dev#=  3 Spd=12  MxCh= 0
D:  Ver= 1.00 Cls=00(>ifc ) Sub=00 Prot=00 MxPS= 8 #Cfgs=  1
P:  Vendor=07cf ProdID=1001 Rev=10.00
C:* #Ifs= 1 Cfg#= 1 Atr=40 MxPwr=  0mA
I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 3 Cls=08(stor.) Sub=05 Prot=00 Driver=usb-storage
E:  Ad=81(I) Atr=02(Bulk) MxPS=  64 Ivl=  0ms
E:  Ad=02(O) Atr=02(Bulk) MxPS=  64 Ivl=  0ms
E:  Ad=83(I) Atr=03(Int.) MxPS=   8 Ivl=  1ms
As the patch enables the workaround for a fairly huge range of revision
numbers, it may be better to have two distinct lines with smaller
ranges instead of one bug range - I leave this decision to people
who know more about USB than I do ;-)
