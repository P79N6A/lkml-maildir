Here (P2, mobo intel SR440BX, IDE disk; RH-6.0/6.1; updated
binutils-2.9.5.0.22) all 2.3.x kernels give filesystem corruption when
compiling AFAIKS (Shared blocks between files that were there before and
new files, lost files, old, untouched files corrupted, the works. Even
stuff that crashed e2fsprogs-1.17). 2.3.20 ate 1/2 of /etc... The 2.2.x (up
to 14pre11 at least) look fine. Strangely, 2.3.20 on a P worked fine...
