This is going straight to rc1 because it contains a lot of security fixes
for local security problems found by Silvio's audit Solar Designer and
a couple of other folks. The other stuff is minor and is the entire 2.2
pending queue anyway.
Special thanks go to Openwall who did pretty much all of the security 
backporting work. This is mostly their kernel update not mine.
