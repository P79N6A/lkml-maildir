	Suppose I take the Linux kernel and make lots of changes to it. I 
then obfuscate the source and hand the source to another person. I've 
clearly not violated the GPL at this point because I haven't 
distributed anything but source.
	That person compiles the source and distributes it. Has he violated 
the GPL? The only way your reply can make any sense is if it's okay 
to distribute obfuscated source to meet GPL requirements if it was 
the obfuscated source that was compiled to make the executable that 
was distributed.
	It is, at least in principle, possible to make changes to obfuscated 
source. I submit that this is a possible interpretation of the GPL's 
"preferred form" clause. However, I don't think it's what the GPL 
intended and I wouldn't bet money that a court would go along with 
it.

	I did. I replied privately to your private replies and publicly to 
your public replies.
