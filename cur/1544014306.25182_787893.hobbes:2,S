This got hashed out between HPA, David Woodhouse and I and agreed that
we'd keep the headers exported.
Linus didn't like the conditional byteorder.h and some arches were
already using it.  So I did the sweep of all arches just to get
this over with and move on.  Sorry I didn't give you a heads up
beforehand.
Cheers,
