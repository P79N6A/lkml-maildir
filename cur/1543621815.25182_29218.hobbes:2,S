	Hello Glover ,  I get the same messages & do not get system
	lock ups .  Might try sending a little bit more info about
	what is going on around any of the lock ups .  If you can
	reliably lock up the system by accessing the tape drive .
	Then send some info to the list about the system & the tape
	drive and how it is attached to the system .  Hth ,  JimL
ps:	All disk & tape drives are scsi .
