Hi there,
I have ut2003/2004, and in both I can hear the crackling with kernel 2.6.3.
With 2.6.2-rc3 everything was fine.
I tried another openal lib (selfcompiled, armyops) but it doesn't help.
(I normally start my ut with "nice -n -1". If I start it with normal priority,
the sound gets a bit less crackling)
xmms works fine.
I have an intel8x0 alsa driver with oss support for my SiS chip
(P4 2.4Ghz/SiS645DX). And I'm using the nvidia driver for my GF card.
Kernel compiled with PREEMPT.
Regards,
Martin
