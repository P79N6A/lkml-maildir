Hi Kirill,
I don't quite understand you. If the page allocation fails in the
fault handler, we don't want to kill current if it is marked as
OOM_DISABLE or sysctl_panic_on_oom is set... imagine a critical
service in a failover system.
It should be quite likely for another process to be kiled and
provide enough memory to keep the system running. Presuming you
have faith in the concept of the OOM killer ;)
Cheers,
Nick
