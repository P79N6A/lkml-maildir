This thread was about encryption. And it was about IV's. The only
encryption that vanilla loop.c (from 2.2.17) offers is 'none' and 'xor'.
None is just that: a no-op. And xor does not use an IV. So the only
ciphers that could possibly have been adressed by this patch are the
ones in the kerneli patch. So the on-disk format did _not_ change
between recent int-2.2.x.y kernels and 2.4-testx, provided the user
followed the recommendations and used the previously mentioned option to
use relative block numbers as IV's.
