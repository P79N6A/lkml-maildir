Hi,
I recently upgraded Redhat 5.1 to kernel 2.2.7
The old kernel is 2.0.34, which correctly recoganize
my 3Com 900 card at IRQ 10, base address 0x6100, and
the card works perfectly.  I use DHCP.
Under the new kernel, the DHCP failed.  I looked at
/proc/interrupts, and cannot find IRQ 10, but dmesg
shows the card is found, with correct IRQ 10, 0x6100.
I booted using old kernel 2.0.34, everything works
OK again.  What is the problem? 
Feng
