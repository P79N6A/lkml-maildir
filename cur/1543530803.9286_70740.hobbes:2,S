   Yes there will. Once a program has allocated its memory, it is always
available as long as you don't overcommit memory.
   Perhaps we are simply thinking of two different worst-case scenarios? The
one I'm thinking of is the case where applications use all the memory they
have allocated. A kernel which doesn't overcommit memory needs to do nothing
to handle that situation.

   You know I don't.

   I've answered that more than ten times now: No overcommitment of memory.
