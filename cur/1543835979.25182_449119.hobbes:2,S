i should clarify things a bit here.  yes, hans' goal is for there to
be no difference between the "xattr" namespace and the "readdir" one.
unfortunately, this is not feasible with the current VFS, and some
major work would have to be done to enable this without some
pathological cases cropping up.  some very smart people think that it
cannot be done at all.
xattr is a seperate VFS interface, which avoids those problems by
defining certain restrictions on how the 'files' which live in that
namespace can be manupulated.  for instance, hard links are
non-existent, and the 'mv' command cannot move a file between
different xattr namespaces.
enabling xattr would have no connection to the file-as-directory
stuff, and (without extra work) would not even allow access to the
things reiser4 defined in the '...' directory.  also enabling xattr in
the way i intend would in no way compromise hans' long-term vision.
HOWEVER, i *need* to point out that hans and i disagree somewhat on
the specifics here, and so i should say adamently "i don't speak here
on behalf of hans or namesys".
that won't stop me from submitting my own patch though :)
