Hello,
Since some time I'm getting the following log entries under 2.6.15:
Mar  7 05:42:48 tiger kernel: skge Ram write data parity error
Mar  7 05:42:48 tiger kernel: skge Ram read data parity error
Does this mean my hardware is faulty? The error message seems to imply
that, but since I am not experiencing any problems and a comment in
skge.c says
/* Parity errors seem to happen when Genesis is connected to a switch
 * with no other ports present. Heartbeat error??
 */
talking about some other sort of parity error though ("mac parity") I'm
not sure any more. Can anybody enlighten me?	
Thanks,
Aaron
