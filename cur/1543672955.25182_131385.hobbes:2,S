Look at the x86-64 context switching code.  If memory addressed by the
GDT entries has a 32-bit address it uses a different method than for
cases where the virtual address has more than 32 bits.  This way of
handling GDT entries is faster according to ak.  So, it's not a
correctness thing, it's a performance thing.
