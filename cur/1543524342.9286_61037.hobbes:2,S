Yes, of course.

I found that b_rsector is the 512 byte sector number and b_blocknr is
relative to the block size of the device. b_blocknr is set with
getblk() for example, and here you pass the actual location of the
device. ll_rw_block() sets b_rsector to b_blocknr * (b_size >> 9),
so there you have it.
