Seconded.  Off by default and with appropriate security caveats in the
Configure.help section, which Robert has already mentioned.
It's pretty critical given the burgeoning amount of cryptography in
production environments where entropy from disk I/O is essentially
non-existent.  The security concerns are very valid, but many trade-offs
are worth it, IMHO.  I will most likely be dead in the water soon unless
I start using this patch in certain places.
Just my two humble cents,
