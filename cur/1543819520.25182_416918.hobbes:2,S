Hi all,
I'm porting my network driver from 2.6.12 to 2.6.16. It almostly work
without any change, except the netpoll mode. When I use kgdb to debug
kernel, gdb client can not establish the connection with gdb server.
Then I digged into the code, and I found in the routine "__netpoll_rx"
in the file "net/core/netpoll.c", the "checksum_udp" call always
failed, but it works on 2.6.12.
Could you please give me some suggestions?
Thanks a lot.
Regards,
-Aubrey
