Actually the compiler version has nothing to do with it -- I'm pretty
sure even gcc 2.X would warn on that.  The actual reason that most people
don't see that is that an arch w/o __HAVE_ARCH_MEMCPY is pretty rare.
Still, no reason for the reference C version of that function to emit
a warning, so it's worth fixing.
