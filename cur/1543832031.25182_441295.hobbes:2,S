Subject: [PATCH] Fix PCI error token awkward value
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The pci channel state token currently has a poor choice of values;
there  are two ways of indicating that "everything's OK": 0 and 1.
This is a bit of a burden.
If a devce driver wants to check if the pci channel is in a working
or a disconnected state, the driver writer must perform checks similar
to
   if((pdev->error_state != 0) &&
      (pdev->error_state != pci_channel_io_normal)) {
         whatever();
   }
which is rather akward. The first check is needed because 
stuct pci_dev is inited to all-zeros. The scond is needed 
because the error recovery will set the state to 
pci_channel_io_normal (which is not zero).
This patch fixes this awkwardness.
