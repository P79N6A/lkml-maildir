Hi.
These cdu31a patches are based on 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/12/18/107
from Ondrej Zary <linux@rainbow-software.org>
Split into three files (see replies):
1 - printk and other trivial cleanups
2 - semaphorifization (hey, i invented a new word)
3 - use wait_event instead of sleep_on in irq handling
Patches have been tested by Ondrej, thanks!
	Domen
