And worse yet, depending on what BIOS options you set at config time,
or what might happen after you upgrade the BIOS, whether the drive
looks like PATA or SATA could change over time.  So if you have
/dev/hda hard-coded in your /etc/fstab file, you could and probably
will potentially lose after you change a BIOS option or take a BIOS
upgrade causing the BIOS configs to get resent and disabling PATA
emulation, such that your disk that had previously been /dev/hda now
shows up as /dev/sda.  (And this is something you will very badly
*want* since your disk drive access will be **much** faster once you
stop using PATA emulation.)
Yet another reason why people who desperately are trying to cling to
the good old days of stable device enumerations are going to be
disappointed; the *type* of the drive can change over time, even for
something as simple as a laptop's primary hard drive, which seem to be
some people's favorite example.
Unfortunately, people are just going to have to suck it up and get
used to a much more complicated world.
