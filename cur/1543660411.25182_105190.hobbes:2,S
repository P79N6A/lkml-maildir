Hum, that's no longer true, it appears the Linux PnP support didn't set up 
the card, because if I tell the BIOS that the OS is *not* PnP aware, I 
then get messages:
  pnp: the driver 'parport_pc' has been registered
  pnp: pnp: match found with the PnP device '00:12' and the driver 'parport_pc'
  parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778) [PCSPP,TRISTATE]
  parport0: irq 7 detected
  parport0: cpp_daisy: aa5500ff(00)
  parport0: assign_addrs: aa5500ff(00)
  Module parport cannot be unloaded due to unsafe usage in include/linux/module.h:430
  Module parport_pc cannot be unloaded due to unsafe usage in include/linux/module.h:430
  parport0: Legacy device
Infortunately the lpd still says it can't find the printer, the irq isn't 
in /proc/interrupts, and is the "unloaded" stuff informational or does it 
indicate that the modules are being deactivated?

See above, this has been addressed.

I miss 2.4.20, is what I miss.
