I'm sorry, but I haven't seen any real problems 'pure draft' behavior, and
prefer to stay pretty close to it.  Albert and I have discussed some IMHO
usefull extensions to the draft, which are mainly for compatibility and
ease of transition, but also have long-term benefits.  It appears to me
that you have wandered quite far from the draft, and I prefer to stick
much closer to it.  From a practical standpoint, the extensions we've
proposed can have default values which completely adhere to the draft, or
can be used for increased security and compatibility.  Your proposal, on
the other hand, behaves not at all like the draft, and I am personally
just not interested in going that way.

No, ext3 will break lots of stuff, and take a _long_ time to implement.
I would like to start reaping these benefits sooner than later, and have
an eye toward the future with ext3.
cheers,
