I don't believe Pavel was saying the image would be corrupted. Rather,
the rest of the disk contents are corrupted by replaying the journal and
then resuming back to a memory state that has been made inconsistent
with the disk state because of the journal replay.

This is just reboot kernel. Filesystems aren't mounted before (4).

On the second part, "Precisely."

Sounds like a good idea to me.
