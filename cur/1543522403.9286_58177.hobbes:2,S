Hello!
Since kernel 2.2.5 I get the message "Unexpected IRQ vector 58 on 
CPU#1" on my console, mostly when making "heavy" compilation (e.g. 
make -j3 bzImage) on my SMP-machine. Sometimes it@s also "Unexpected 
IRQ vector 74 on CPU#1". In the past it hasn@t been a problem since 
the machine was completing it job fine.
But since 2.2.13, it sometimes happend that the machine freezes (As I 
said mostly when compiling, especially with multiple jobs). After the 
reboot I couldn@t find any trace for an error in the log files so 
it@s not possible to give details about what happening juast before 
the machine freezes. At least I con provide informations about the 
hardware:
Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-585DX with onboard SCSI-Chip AIC7880
CPUs: two Intel Pentium 233MMX
RAM: 64 MB PS/2
Can someone help (somehow?)
TIA
