If the kernel crashes, then the sound driver won't be able to write
new data to the sound card.  So the sound card plays the last data it
got over and over again (probably between 4 and 16k of data).
So it sounds like the kernel crashed while the sound was playing, but
you can't be sure it was the sound that caused it to crash.
