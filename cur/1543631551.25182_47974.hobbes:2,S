Hi!
I have a very quick look over patch/driver... looks quite ok...
But it doesn't support multiple controllers. We should add 'unsigned
long private' to 'ata_channel struct' and store index in the chipset
table there.
You can remove duplicate entries from module data table.
BTW: please don't touch pdc202xx.c I am playing with it...
