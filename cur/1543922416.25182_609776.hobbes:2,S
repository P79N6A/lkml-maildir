The question is what the security threat is and the value of the secured
items.

The common experience is, that common people just *feel* safer (just
because they have poor security).
With no security, they know that there is no security. With poor
security, they do not know (or can deny) that they have next to no real
security.
The prime example here is the usual (so-called) "personal firewall" on
Windows where people work normally as "administrator".
