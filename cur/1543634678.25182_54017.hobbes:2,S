Subject: non-killable program - kernel problem?

  cleanup (part of postfix) is eating up most of CPU cycles and I cannot
kill it (-9 is ignored) - I guess that means that the problem is
somewhere in kernel (system call). Is it true? Is there anything I can
do to kill it? to find out what the problem is?
  I attached gdb to it but now gdb is stuck as well... I didn't see
anything suspicious in system log...
  kernel 2.4.18, I didn't upgrade it for a long time and this cleanup
problem only occured recently (last few weeks, twice).
  TIA
