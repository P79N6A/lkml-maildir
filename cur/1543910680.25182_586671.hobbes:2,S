my feeling is that it gives us generally higher-quality scheduling if we 
drive all things scheduler via virtual time. Do you agree with that?

right now there are two distinct and independent things: scheduler 
behavior (the scheduling decisions the scheduler makes) and accounting 
behavior.
the 'invariant' i mentioned only covers scheduler behavior, not 
accounting behavior. Accounting is separate in theory, but coupled in 
practice now via sum_exec_runtime.
Before we do a patch to decouple them again, lets make sure we agree on 
the direction to take here. There are two ways to account within a 
virtual machine: either in real time or in virtual time.
it seems you'd like accounting to be sensitive to 'external load' - i.e. 
you'd like an 'internal' top to show the 'real' CPU accounting, right? 
Wouldnt it be more consistent if a virtual box would not show any 
dependency on external load? (i.e. it would slow down all of its 
internal functionality transparently, without exposing it via /proc. The 
only way to observe that would be the TOD interfaces: gettimeofday and 
real-time clock driven POSIX timers. Even timer_list could be driven via 
virtual time - although that would probably break user expectations, 
right?) Or would accounting-in-virtual-time break user expectations too? 
(most of the other hypervisors let guests account in virtual time.)
