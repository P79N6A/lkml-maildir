Thank you for merging add-vmcoreinfo.patch.
I created the patchset for your comments and some corrections.
The patchset is for linux-2.6.23-rc4-mm1.
[1/3] Cleanup the coding style according to Andrew's comments:
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/kexec/2007-August/000522.html
- vmcoreinfo_append_str() should have suitable __attribute__s so that
  the compiler can check its use.
- vmcoreinfo_max_size should have size_t.
- Use get_seconds() instead of xtime.tv_sec.
- Use init_uts_ns.name.release instead of UTS_RELEASE.
[2/3] Add nodemask_t's size and NR_FREE_PAGES's value to vmcoreinfo_data.
  The dump filetering command 'makedumpfile'(v1.1.6 or before) had assumed
  the above values, and it was not good from the reliability viewpoint.
  So makedumpfile v1.2.0 came to need these values and I created the patch
  to let the kernel output them.
  makedumpfile site:
  
https://sourceforge.net/projects/makedumpfile/
[3/3] Use the existing ia64_tpa() instead of asm code.
Thanks
