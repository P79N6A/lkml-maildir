I forgot PG_locked already existed :)

That's been the main stumbling block to anyone actually trying it.  It
involves per-page housekeeping at every mlock() and every time a locked vma
gets unmapped.

The point would be to have a way of finding and skipping the locked page
before we go look up the vmas for it.  2.4 doesn't have that problem
because it's working from the vma.
