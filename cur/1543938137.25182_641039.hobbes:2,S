I might have some idea.  From your lspci, it looks like a board I had some 
issues with about one year ago.  It was a Tyan server board that I had put a 
3ware card into a pci-X 133MHz slot.  Well, for some reason, the Broadcom 
chip would have trouble, bad data, kernel problems like yours.  I called 
Tyan and they had me short a jumper that forced the slot to 100MHz (the bus 
is shared between that slot and the Broadcom chip) and that fixed it for me.
I hope that might be some help to you.
Good luck,
Charles
