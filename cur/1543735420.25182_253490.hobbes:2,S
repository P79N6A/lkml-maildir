Indeed it was that last call to change the power state, as I too figured. Now 
I wonder if there is some other power state that could be set that would 
benefit powersaving, but not prevent the pxe boot rom from beeing confused?
Or should this rather be reported as a bug to Via, so that they can implement 
restoring the adapter from the D3 state in the pxe boot rom?
I've attached what I belive to be a bk patch (kinda new to that) which 
comments out this power-state change, untill something better is found. I 
have not tested WOL with this, but I can't think of any reason why it should 
not work.
