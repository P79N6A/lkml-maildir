Just curious...with these guys 
(
http://www.bigfootnetworks.com/KillerOverview.aspx
) putting linux on a 
PCI NIC to allow them to bypass Windows' network stack, has anyone ever 
considered doing "hardware" raid by using an embedded cpu running linux 
software RAID, with battery-backed memory?
It would theoretically allow you to remain feature-compatible by 
downloading new kernels to your RAID card.
