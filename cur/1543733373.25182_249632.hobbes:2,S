It'll be accidental side-effects arising from changes to other parts of the
page reclaim code.

Hopefully very little.  Unless we choose to deliberately change the swapout
behaviour.  The code in there is complex and as you've seen, has surprising
interactions.  And changes have been made without sufficiently broad testing.
So I'll be setting the bar much higher for changes to vmscan.c.  It takes a
*lot* of work to demonstrate that a change in there does what it's supposed
to do without breaking other things.
That being said, your tests are interesting.  There's a wide spread of
results across different kernel versions and across different swappiness
settings.  But the question is: which behaviour is correct for your users,
and why?
