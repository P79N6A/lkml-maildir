[...] I didn't say it was easy (or rather explicitely said it would be tricky).
Probably it would be possible to fold it somehow into rt mutexes PI,
but it's not easy and semaphores would need to be handled too.
Just my point was to solve the metadata RT problem unconditionally increasing
the priority is a bad idea and not really a replacement to a "full"
solution. Short term a user can just increase the priority of all the XFS 
threads anyways.
