Err, probably.  But we'd need to have a 1000-email argument first.
Right now many subsystems and often many individual drivers go and
implement their own set of debugging macros and knobs to twiddle.  This was
a great source of fun for me in trying to support gcc-2.95.x - each time a
new debug macro got implemented I had to go in there (again) and apply the
gcc-2.95.x-macro-expansion-bug-workaround to it.
Yes, one common toolset with a common way of controlling it would be much
more sensible than the present chaos.  I count 163 separate definitions of
dprintk(), and that's excluding all the non-x86 arch and include dirs.

Something like that..   Just don't cc me while you work it out ;)
