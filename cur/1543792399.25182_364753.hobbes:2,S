i like the cleanup, but wouldnt it be simpler to dedicate GDT entry #8 
to the 0x40 descriptor, and hence be compatible with such broken BIOSes 
by default? Right now entry #8 is taken up by TLS segment #2, but we 
could change GDT_ENTRY_TLS_MIN from 6 to 9 and push the TLS segments to 
entries 9,10,11. [ Could there be any buggy SMM code that relies on 
having something at 0x40? ]
