Certainly an improvement. Maybe it will help a little.
But really, do_div is not a C function, it has very
nonintuitive behaviour.
The two bugs are: (i) the name is wrong, it returns a
remainder but the name only talks about dividing, and
(ii) worst of all, it changes its first argument.

And the comment that you added, copied from elsewhere,
is confusing too. The first parameter is not uint64_t *.
This thing cannot be described in C.
I would still like to replace do_div by DO_DIV_AND_REM
as a big fat warning - this is a macro, read the definition.
And the common case, where no remainder is used, by DO_DIV
#define DO_DIV(a,b)	(void) DO_DIV_AND_REM(a,b)

[Perhaps DO_DIV64, to also indicate a type.]
[The same problem happens with sector_div. I recall having
to fix sector_div calls in scsi code. These functions are
bugs waiting to happen. Nobody expects that after
	res = func(a,b);
the value of a has changed.]
