Try downloading this boot disk image from ftp.slackware.com, (or a mirror):
/pub/slackware/slackware-current/bootdisks/bare.i
write it to a disk, and boot from it.
Let us know whether it gets to the point where it asks you for the next disk or not.  If the kernel panics before that point, there is definitely something wrong.
If it does panic before asking for the next disk, you could try the lowmem.i boot disk in the same directory, and let us know whether that boots as well.
