I have a driver module that returns the following when attempting
to load on linux-2.4.0-test5 on ix86 platforms:
  init_module_mod->init out of bounds.
Same module loads fine on sparc64 platform running linux-2.4.0-test5
and used to load fine on linux-<=2.3.99-pre9 on both platforms.
Any ideas?
Thanks so much,
-SteveR
