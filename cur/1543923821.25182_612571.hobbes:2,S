Yes, that's what I've understand, indeed.

Ok, but for that, I prefer to let the IDR maintainers see what they can do,
because I'm not familiar at all with the IDR implementation and can not focus on
that now.
So do you think that just providing a new API (something like
idr_pre_allocate(), as you say above) would be better than nothing ?
Or we just leave the code as is for now ?
