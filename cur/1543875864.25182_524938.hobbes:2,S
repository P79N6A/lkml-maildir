May I suggest that if you want proper testing that it not only should be 
a config option but a boot time option as well? Otherwise people will be 
comparing an old scheduler with an RSDL kernel, and they will diverge as 
time goes on.
More people would be willing to reboot and test on a similar load than 
will keep two versions of the kernel around. And if you get people 
testing RSDL against a vendor kernel which might be hacked, it will be 
even less meaningful.
Please consider the benefits of making RSDL the default scheduler, and 
leaving people with the old scheduler with an otherwise identical kernel 
as a fair and meaningful comparison.
There, that's a technical argument ;-)
