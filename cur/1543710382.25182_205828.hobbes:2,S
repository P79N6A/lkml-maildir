This has occurred on any combination of the following six things:
Network cards:
Realtek 8139
SiS 900 Integrated
NE2K
3Com 3c905b
Motherboard chipsets:
ALI M1541
SiS 740
AMD 760
On the following kernel versions: 2.4.20, 2.4.21, 2.4.22, 2.4.23 (and 
-aa variants of 2.4.22, .23), 2.6.1, 2.6.2, 2.6.3.
It could well be a BIOS setting I'm habitually setting and forgetting 
about which is common to all motherboards, I'll have to check on that. 
Are there any of these I should be looking out for?
