Is the barely better code really worth all the ugliness from the ifdefs? I have doubts.
I think your idea of saving some cache lines by not having the unused
zones in the fallback lists etc. is a good one, but your current implementation
with its ifdef maze is extremly ugly. Surely this can be a done less
intrusively?
