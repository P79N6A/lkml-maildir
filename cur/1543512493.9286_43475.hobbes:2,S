Ah, Tigran, this is something I was about to send you.. strncmp doesn't
make much sense there; it's not a string after all, it's a 4-byte magic
number:
	if (memcmp(elf_ex.e_ident, ELFMAG, SELFMAG) != 0)
makes much more sense.  And if this makes a difference on other endian
platforms, why are they doing a memset further down the file in the
core dump routine?  :-)
