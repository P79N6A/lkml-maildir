Can you do an install with the thing turned off, and then 
 - compile the kernel with CONFIG_PCI_DEBUG
 - boot with the parallel port enabled, and send as much of the bootup 
   output (and /proc/iomem and /proc/ioport) as possible
 - boot with the parallel port disabled, and send the same output for that 
   working case.
I have no clue why the parallel port should matter, but it could change 
some resource allocation issues.
