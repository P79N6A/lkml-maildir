Locks are not nearly the issue that you're making them out to be, and neither 
are most processes. It's only fuse that has caused this whole ding.
The lack of context from the original kernel is also going to be a problem. If 
you want to store the image on a local hard disk, the kernel being hibernated 
is going to need to do that for you, because it will need to use the 
information only it has regarding what swap is in use, how files on mounted 
filesystems map to devices and sectors and so on. It will need to somehow 
transfer that information from itself to the 'saving kernel'. In the end, the 
only advantage you'll get is that you don't have to worry about fuse 
processes anymore.
Frankly, I wish kexec was a viable alternative. I'm tired of working on kernel 
code, and would be perfectly happy to stop working on Suspend2 if kexec would 
work or if Rafael got swsusp to a point where the difference in features was 
minimal. But I just can't see that kexec is a viable alternative. Sorry.
Nigel
