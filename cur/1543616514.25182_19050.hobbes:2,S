It's worse than you think.
Distinguishing between XP and MP athlon for example needs
capability bit testing.  (And some XP's _are_ now multiprocessor
capable, just to confuse the issue some more), so relying on
the cpuid identity string isn't foolproof.
(Also, some implementations allow for this string to be changed,
 some folks have it set to "PenguinPowered" and the likes 8-)

Asides from the above issues, multiple CPUs have the same
cpuid sometimes, meaning you have to check things like
cache size as well (though most (all?) of these should
end up with the same CONFIG_ option iirc, so this shouldn't
be an issue -- you should check to be sure though)
x86info's identify.c files should give you a fairly
comprehensive guide to the various types.
