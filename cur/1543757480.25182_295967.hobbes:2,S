It doesn't really need vesafb for anything. Back in the days of 2.6.7 
I used to release a version of bootsplash that had the dep. on vesafb 
removed. It worked fine with at least some other fb drivers.
You might also want to save yourself some work and try out an
alternative solution called fbsplash [1], which I designed after I got 
tired of fixing bootsplash and which I actively maintain. Fbsplash 
provides virtually the same functionality, and it has as much code as 
possible moved into userspace (no more JPEG decoders in the kernel).
