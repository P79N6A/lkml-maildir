Hi
After resolving 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7481
I was thinking about possibilities how to prevent such bugs with
testing. Usually just few insmods and rmmods show, whether the
initialization and cleanup code of module is ok or not.
I created a script which do the automatic job of finding all modules
and inserting/removing them (see attachment). On my Lifebook E8110,
kernel 2.6.18.2, the following modules were problematic:
arptable_filter pktgen rfcomm rpcsec_gss_krb5 sdhci xt_NFQUEUE
Kernel logs usually say "BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request
at virtual address ..." or "BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer
dereference at virtual address 00000000".
When trying knoppix 5.0.1, my script causes total freeze quickly.
Is it worth to report each buggy module to bugzilla? Reproducing is
quite simple, effects common. People just usually don't use many
insmod-s & rmmod-s in normal life...
