Ok thats the bit I needed to see. The first part of the EIP value tells me
whether you are in the APM BIOS (0x50) or the kernel (0x10) - you have an
APM bios bug. Unfortunately this is very typical as windows uses the 16bit
bios entry point not the 32bit one.
There are two ways around that problem. The first is to find out if there
is a BIOS upgrade for your machine. The second if it only ever dies on the
APM bios at shutdown is to look in the linux-kernel archive (www.tux.org
has it) for a patch posted sometime over the last week that switches to
16bit mode on a shutdown
