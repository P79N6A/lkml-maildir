The reason I added GPL is not because of some idea that this is all 
"chummy" with the kernel. But because I derived the mcount code from 
glibc's version of mcount. Now you may argue that glibc is under LGPL 
and a non-GPL export is fine. But I've been advised that if I ever take 
code from someone else, to always export it with GPL.
