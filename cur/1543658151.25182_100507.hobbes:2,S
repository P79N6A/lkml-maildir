Subject: 2.5.54-mjb2 (scalability / NUMA patchset)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The patchset contains mainly scalability and NUMA stuff, and anything
else that stops things from irritating me. It's meant to be pretty stable,
not so much a testing ground for new stuff.
I'd be very interested in feedback from anyone willing to test on any platform, however large or small.
http://www.aracnet.com/~fletch/linux/2.5.54/patch-2.5.54-mjb2.bz2
Since 2.5.54-mjb1 (mainly finished moving NUMA-Q into subarch).
- kgdb
+ kgdb (new version)				Andrew Morton / Various People
~ i386_caching_topo (rejigged)
+ cleanup_cpu_apicid				Martin Bligh
+ smpboot_cam					Martin Bligh
+ nuke_clustered_apic				Martin Bligh
~ interrupt_stacks (fixed a warning)
~ stack_usage_check (fixed a warning)
