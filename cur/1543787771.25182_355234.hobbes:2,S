Ahh, yes and no, Robert.  The un-answered question, for that
512 processor Altix system, would be "but does it run things 512
times faster?"  Methinks not, by a very wide margin.  Yes, do a lot
of unrelated things fast maybe, but render a 30 megabyte page with
ghostscript in 10 milliseconds?  Never happen IMO.
And Christoph in the next msg, calls him 1/2 drunk.  He doesn't come
across to me as being more than 1 beer drunk.  And he does make some
interesting points, so if they aren't valid, lets use proveable logic
to shoot them down, not name calling and pointless rhetoric.
