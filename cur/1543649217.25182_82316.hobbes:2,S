I can appreciate that you are more interested in stability than features
now, and that's good in general. However, someone should be looking at
functional stuff like this, because it's (a) out and working and (b) adds
a whole new and important capability to Linux.
When I look at things like zero copy NFS and Reiser-4, my first impression
is that they are essentially incremental improvements to existing
features. And as hard as I've yelled about NFS4, I have been told that is
too. But things like JFS, XFS and kexec generate that "Holy shit, look
what they added now!" feeling. And as a whole new capability I really
would like to see it go in, even as I appreciate that it's not your job, I
hope it becomes someone's job, because I sure boot a lot of slow computers
on a regular basis :-(

I realize that you're busy, but there seem to be a shitload of drivers
which work compiled in and not as modules.
