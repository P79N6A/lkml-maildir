    I found somewhat strange that you check for 0xABCDExxx signature in 32-bit 
PCI config. reg. 0x78 while HighPoint's own drivers read BM reg. 0x90 (i.e. 
PCI config. 0x70) for that. PCI reg. 0x7A is DPLL precision adjust reg. and 
0x7B is the input clock select and IRQ reg., so it'd be quite strange if the 
BIOS used them for any kind of signature...
WBR, Sergei
