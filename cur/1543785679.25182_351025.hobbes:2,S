This interface tells from where the kernel was booted from. I don't
think a device should have an attribute where the meaning would be
"the current running kernel came via this device into memory".
IMHO this should be an attribute of the kernel and therefore I
thought /sys/kernel would be a good idea.

Same here.

Sure, so I would end up with quite a few files:
always a file which tells the type of ipl e.g. ipl_type and dependent
on that additionally:
- in case of ccw ipl:
   just the bus_id of the ipl device (e.g. ipl_bus_id).
- in case of fcp ipl:
   the bus_id, the wwpn and the fcp_lun all exported via different files.
Does that sound reasonable?
