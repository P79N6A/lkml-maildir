Why do you support all operations for 64-bit futexes?
IMHO PI futexes don't make sense for 64-bit futexes, PI futexes have
hardcoded bit layout of the 32-bit word.  Similarly, FUTEX_WAKE
is not really necessary for 64-bit futexes, 32-bit futex's FUTEX_WAKE
can wake it equally well (it never reads anything, all it cares
is about the futex's address).  Similarly, I don't see a need for
FUTEX_WAKE_OP (and this could simplify the patch quite a lot, no
need to change asm*/futex.h headers at all).
All that's needed is 64-bit FUTEX_WAIT and perhaps FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE.
