64KB for 8-bit DMA; 128KB for 16-bit DMA. It's a limitation of the 
legacy third-party-DMA controllers, which had only 16-bit address 
registers (the high part of the address lives in a non-counting 
register). This doesn't apply to bus-master DMA, just the legacy 
(8237) stuff. There was also a 24-bit address limitation.
