Subject: [patch 8/9] compat_ioctl: call disk->fops->compat_ioctl without BKL
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/6/64

Normally, all compat_ioctl operations are called without the BKL, the
block device operations are an exception to this rule.
Make this work the same as the other handlers.
Signed-off-by: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>

It would be good to find out whether it has been using the BKL
on purpose or by accident, before this patch gets applied.
