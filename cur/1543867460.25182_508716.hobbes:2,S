Do we really need to add this?
Wouldn't it be much nicer to just teach people to use one of the existing 
signature things that we need for _other_ cases anyway, and already have 
merged?
(Of course, it's possible that none of the current crypto supports any 
signature checking at all - I didn't actually look. In which case my 
argument is pointless).
