Interesting comment. Well, of course all the CONFIG options have
distinct names. That's a given.
The question is whether they have distinct keys. That's also true, as of
now.
The next question that arises is whether they will have distinct keys in
the future.  The answer to that is "probably". You can predict that by
the time we have 2^32+1 config options (and we presently have somewhere
beween 600 and 1500), by the pigeonhole principle two of the  32 bit
keys will collide.
I don't know what names will be invented, but if you regard each
new name as a random experiment, and you invent 1000 new names, then
the chance of a collision is 1-(1-1/2^32)(1-2/2^32)...(1-1000/2^32)
or approximately 1000^2/2 / 2^32. Or 2^19 / 2^32 = 1/2^13 = 1/8000.
I.e. you would have to completely rename all the config options
8000 times before you could reasonably expect to come up with a
conflicting pair. That's not merely ridiculous, it's impossible. We do
not expect 8000 issues of the kernel, let alone issues of the kernel
with all new option names in!
If you are adding a single new option to a kernel with 1000 options
already named, then your chances of a conflict are something like
1000/ 2^32 = 1 / 2^22 = 1 / 4,000,000. So we would expect 4,000,000
new options (approx, and I realize this calc. should be
modified ..) to be added  before even a single collision is detected.
I feel safe. And if someone does cause a conflict, I will ask them
politely to rename.

I liked the solution with gzipped data myself. It seemed to be simple
and elegant. But it was not liked by the kernel deities, as I recall,
because it would not guarantee to stay below 4KB. We have now solved
that problem. I routinely produce ~12KB of output in /proc, but the
dislike lingers. There are other reasons too ...

Yes. Another problem is switching between, say 2.0.* and 2.2.*, where
the names of the modules and their options have changed. This is a
reason for having /proc/config* info too.

Unfortunately, when you are in a running machine, you do not
necessarily know which image was booted (the lilo options linger,
but there is no guarantee that lilo was used or that the image has
remained). Some of my machines have 200 days uptime (and I have one
machine which was at 2 years ..). The implications are obvious.

Reading it from the image doesn't waste space. OTOH you can't rely on
it. And if you don't like wasting space, well, I can allow one to
wipe /proc/config with a echo 1.

I liked that too.

There is a general dislike of including what is apparently a large and
meaningless string into the kernel space.

Root should be able to switch off /proc/config anytime.  I'll include
that next.

I agree mostly, but it is running size that that is important to many
people.

You can recreate System.map (mostly) from /proc/ksyms. Statics
are the problem.

It would be useful to have the full map available, I agree.

This is why I created a structure, rather than a string.

I'll forward to the kernel list, for discussion at least.
