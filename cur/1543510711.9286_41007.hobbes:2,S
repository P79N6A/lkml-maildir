Or... Banavision sends their driver to Alan Cox who maintains the stable
kernels, and Alan promptly releases kernel vX.Y.Z+1 in the course of a
week or two, and thus the driver might even be out before the hardware
hits the shelves in the computer-store...
And of course. I see a great danger with it otherwise; the vendor of
Banavision spreads an RPM on their CD's, because Red Hat is the most
common distribution. Users of other distributions can't install it...
(Sure, it's no problem if you know how to convert the packages, but I can
tell you, that a Debian-user like me doesn't exactly become excuberantly
happy by the fact that much software is only release in RPM's nowadays...

Sure. But we also know how many drivers in Windows that have subtle bugs
because the hardware manufactors haven't understood the API fully. If the
driver gets into the kernel, it has a larger chance of getting a code
review even by people that doesn't even own such a beast...

No, we tell them to upgrade their kernel, as kernel vX.Y.Z, which was
released half a year ago at the same time Banavision released their
adapter, supports that very hardware. After all, if the
hardware-manufactors makes a driver, they can as well submit it to
Linus, with the added bonus that there's a quite large potential of
getting bugs fixed.

Sure, but it's more embarassing to get into the situation Microsoft has
with an API that never is obsoleted, because someone might still run old
drivers...
