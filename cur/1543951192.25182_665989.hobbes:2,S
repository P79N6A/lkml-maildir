Here are 4 fixes fixes against your current git tree that fix some more
problems that have cropped up:
	- nozomi driver fixes for oopses found by users
	- resource calculation problem found by the scsi people
	- sysdev fixes for oopses for kvm and ooprofile code
	- firmware.h gets stubs for when the config option is not
	  enabled, fixing build errors.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
Patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
