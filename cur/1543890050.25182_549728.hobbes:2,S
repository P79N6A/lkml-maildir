And resume is not the the bootloader's job... if memory and registers 
are restored, and a jump is made to the resume address, a resumed system 
should result. clearly some part of that didn't happen :-(

If the mainline resume is depending on that no wonder resume is so 
fragile. User action can change order of module loads, kmalloc calls 
move allocated structures, etc. Counting on anything to be locked in 
place seems naive.

I would hope that the data used by the resumed kernel would be the same 
data that was suspended, not something from another kernel.

Someone else dropped a note saying the FC kernels use suspend2, and work 
fine. I'm off to look at the FC source and see if that's the case. That 
would explain why suspend works and resume doesn't, hopefully there's a 
2.6.21 suspend2 patch in that case.
Thanks for the feedback in any case.
