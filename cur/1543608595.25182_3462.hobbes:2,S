It's the number of sectors that are allowed to pass a request on the
queue, because of merges or inserts before that particular request. So
you want lower than that probably, and you want READ latency to be
smaller than WRITE latency too. The default I set is 8192/16384 iirc, so
go lower than this -- -r512 -w1024 or even lower just to check the
results.

Interesting, the 2.5 design prevents this since it doesn't account
merges as a penalty (like a seek). I can do something like that for 2.4
too, I'll do a patch for you to test.
