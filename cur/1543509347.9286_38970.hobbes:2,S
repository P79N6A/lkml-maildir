Potential deadlock is caused by the userspace process:
   1. interrupt arrives
   2. (other drivers called)
   3. user space driver called
   4.    userspace driver (for some reason) needs page from disk
   5. kernel needs new page, needs I/O
   6. hang - IRQ not dismissed.... system dead....
Granted this is a potential, not a guranteed failure. I wouldn't want
to share IRQs just because of the difficulty in debugging. Thats more
for something in final integration testing, not development, which is
all a userspace driver would be good for.
