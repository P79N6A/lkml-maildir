Actually the other developers of OpenSolaris, primarily, are all the
developers on the Solaris engineering teams. The reason being, under
the new Solaris/Opensolaris model, in order for a Sun developer to put
code into regular Solaris (the Solaris that Sun ships), he/she will
have to put it into Opensolaris first. In other words, Solaris is
becoming a distro, so to speak, of OpenSolaris. And Solaris engineering
is already well down the path to making this happen.
The problem is, I don't think we (Sun) have been doing a great job of
communicating to the world what Opensolaris is exactly, so a lot of
people seem to think the same thing you did -- that the OpenSolaris
development process is a separate thing.
