Some benchmarking done at Berkeley showed that for development loads,
30seconds was too short to avoid excessive writes.
See Roselli, Lorch and Anderson, `A Comparison of File System
Workloads' in Usenix 2000.
http://research.microsoft.com/~lorch/papers/fs-workloads/fs-workloads.html
Their observations (summarised) were that most blocks die because of
overwriting, not because of file deletes.  Their workloads show that
for NT, the write timeout to avoid commits blocks that will soon
become dead needs to be around a day; for typical Unix loads (web
serving, research, software development), an hour is enough.  To catch
75%, a timeout of around 11 minutes is needed.  30seconds worked only
for webserving and undergraduate teaching workloads, and caught around
40% for those workloads; for a research workload and NT fileserving,
30seconds catches only 10-20% of the rewrites.
See especially figure 3 in that paper.
