Hi George,
I assume the rationale is that not reusing the same id immediately helps
catch errors in user code.  Since the id space is global, there
is more chance that one process may be manipulating another processes
timer.  Reusing the same id makes this sort of problem harder to 
catch.
The main reason I changed this in my patch is to avoid the CONFIG
limit on the number of timers.  Since I don't have the fixed array,
I need a way to safely translate a user-space id into a kernel pointer.
