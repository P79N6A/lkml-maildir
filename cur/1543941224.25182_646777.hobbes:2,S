FWIW, I've reviewed the patch in detail a couple of times, and don't see 
any issues with it that haven't already been raised by Serge.
You can add my reviewed-by.
I think it does need more eyes, and some time baking in -mm.  
File capabilities are at least marked experimental, although it's not 
clear what the criteria would be to unmark them.
