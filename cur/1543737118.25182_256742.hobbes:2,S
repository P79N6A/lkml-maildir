| I have found this on dmesg. Is it correct ?
| 
| mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
| input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
| input: ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse on isa0060/serio1
| 
| If not, how can I change the protocol ? A kernel bootparam ?
| In old X, i used 'Option "Protocol" "MouseManPlusPS/2"'.
From Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt:
	psmouse.proto=  [HW,MOUSE] Highest PS2 mouse protocol extension to
			probe for (bare|imps|exps).
so for builtin mouse driver (not a loadable module), use:
	psmouse.proto=bare|imps|exps
However, it read/sounds like the protocol is probed/detected.
Moreover, it also sounds like MouseManPlusPS/2 isn't listed/supported.
The known protocols according to psmouse-base.c are:
static char *psmouse_protocols[] = {
  "None", "PS/2", "PS2++", "PS2T++", "GenPS/2", "ImPS/2", "ImExPS/2", "SynPS/2"};
I guess that you can test:  psmouse.proto=bare
or each listed option to see what helps.
