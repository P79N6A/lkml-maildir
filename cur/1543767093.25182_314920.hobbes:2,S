OK, sounds like an interesting tradeoff.  If any node can be master of a
resource, and there's no resource directory, then any new non-LOCAL
request must query every other node to check if it's the master.  A look
at your dlm shows this is the case:
while ((nodenum = dlm_node_iter_next(&iter)) >= 0) {
        ret = dlm_do_master_request(mle, nodenum);
Of course with a directory you just query one node to find if/who the
master is.  Which is better would depend on the usage. 
If you wanted to do a similar optimization as LOCAL with our dlm, you'd
use parent/child locks where the parent at the top of the tree would
require a lookup but all the child locks would only require local
processing.

Nope, my speculation on how we might do LOCAL above wouldn't work.  It now
seems clear that LOCAL can't really be done with a directory.
