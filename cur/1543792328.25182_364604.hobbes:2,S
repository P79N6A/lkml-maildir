Subject: [PATCH 0/8] Cleanup slab.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Since there was some (albeit very brief) discussion last week about the
need to cleanup mm/slab.c, I figured I'd post these patches.  I was
inspired to cleanup mm/slab.c since I'm working on a project (to be posted
shortly) that touched a bunch of slab code.  I found slab.c to be
inconsistent, to say the least.
