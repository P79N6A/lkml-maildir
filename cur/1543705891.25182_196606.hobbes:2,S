I don't see an easy way to see all of those changesets.
Changesets used to be available at
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/cset/
but what's there now is only for after 2.6.2 was released.
You can also see the changesets listed at
  
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/ChangeSet@-4w?nav=index.html
(that's all changesets for the last 4 weeks) and then just look
at all of the changes between the v2.6.2-rc1 and v2.6.2-rc2 tags
(which are highlighted in yellow).
