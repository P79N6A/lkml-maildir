Yes -- the worst case is that people have to work together, and it 
tweaks people who like to organize source files nicely into directories :)

Sure.  Reasonable request, and doable within today's APIs.

So people have to work together...  darn :)  most drivers these days are 
organized nicely into nicely modular units anyway, making it easy to 
write a "shell" driver that simply registers each sub-driver, and helps 
arbitrate/provide resources to sub-units.
Consider, for example, a PCI driver that loads, and then fills in 
platform_data to provide a specific set of resources to a platform 
driver (a common idiom).  You would need to create parented struct 
devices (parent: pci_dev's device), but everything else should work within
I could even forsee a future where most drivers are written in a generic 
platform-driver style, and PCI|sbus|embedded-bus|blah are simply 
bus-specific shells that fill in platform data.
All of this should be nicely possible within the existing usage of 
struct device, platform drivers, generic DMA API, iomap, etc.
