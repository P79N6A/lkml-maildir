If you can't drop in kdb, or no sysreq, then your interrupts are
disabled. I used to be (with older systems anyway) that NMI button was
on the system, so one could send an NMI and make the handler to print a
trace. Newer systems might not have that, so you can built your own PCI
card to send an NMI :)
Another possibility is to use port 80 and make suspicious code print
something to it. Once we used a small self-built thing with LEDs to
catch the output to the parallel port while debugging silent boot
failure. There are some port 80 cards that you can buy:

If your system has a jtag then in target probe would be useful if you
have one (or can borrow one, those are expensive).
