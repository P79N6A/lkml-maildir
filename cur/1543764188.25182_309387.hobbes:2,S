Yes, that looks more sensible. It hides the fact that the initcall ever 
existed, rather than explicitly telling you that it's been skipped, but I 
don't imagine that that's ever going to cause a problem in practice (i.e., I 
don't think anyone would ever enable "force_ohci1394=off" by mistake and 
also without noticing).

I think so, though I don't really know a great deal about this area. 
An IA64 descriptor is of the form { &code, &data_context }, and a function 
pointer is a pointer to such a descriptor. Presumably, setting a function 
pointer to NULL will either end up setting the pointer-to-descriptor to NULL 
or the code pointer to NULL, but either way, I would expect the 'if 
(!*call)' comparison to work as intended. 
Best thing would be to get someone on IA64 and/or PPC64 to check this for 
you. Also might be worth checking that the patch works as intended with 
CONFIG_MODULES=n (assuming you haven't already).

Malcolm
