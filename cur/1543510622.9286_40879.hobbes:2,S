Subject: [patch] kernel API documentation system

Attached is a simple kernel API documentation system, based on the one
used in GNOME.  Documentation, TODO list, two examples, and the
kernel-doc.pl are all included in this patch (diff'd against 2.3.18ac8).
The general idea is to document API functions inside the source code,
and then use the new "make apidocs" target to re-generate the kernel API
documentation.  kernel-doc.pl is very flexible and can output DocBook,
man, HTML, and other formats.
The current "make apidocs" command creates
Documentation/kernel-api.html, containing all documentation.  Eventually
this system should generate individual man pages, one per kernel API
function, in addition to the existing kernel-api.html file.
Comments welcome.  I think this system would be helpful to many.
Regards,
	Jeff
