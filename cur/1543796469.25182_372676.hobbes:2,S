Sure.  BUT it will break current users.  I'm suggesting we jerk that
field out for 2.6.15, and reintroduce it for >= 2.6.16, when we can (1)
ensure everyone has a fixed module-init tools, or (2) make sure everyone
is using the module alias stuff, or both.
It seems the simplest solution, surely?
Rusty.
