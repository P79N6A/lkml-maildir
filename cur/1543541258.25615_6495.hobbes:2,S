Subject: Can't access module memory with gdb

I'm happily displaying memory within the kernel proper address space
using gdb (gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore).  Unfortunately I can't dump memory
in my module address space.  If I do something like:
(gdb) x /4xw 0xcc061234
where the address is in my module I get "Cannot access memory at address
0xcc061234."
I'm using kernel 2.2.12 and gdb 4.18.
I haven't been able to find anything describing this problem.  Is there
a workaround?
The bug I'm chasing reproduces itself in different ways and I want to
attack its current incarnation if I can, so I'd like to avoid rebooting
if possible.
Thanks,
Dave
