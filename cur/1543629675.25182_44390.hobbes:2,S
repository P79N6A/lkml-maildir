[aia21@drop hda]$ ideinfo
bash: ideinfo: command not found
Obviously distros haven't caught up with this development. )-:
Care to give me a URL? A quick google for "ideinfo Linux download" didn't 
bring up anything looking relevant.

I want to know this info. (-: Admittedly normal users don't need it... It 
is useful for diagnosing problems with NTFS and MD setups for example (in 
conjunction with fdisk -l shown in sectors).

I like text parsing... It is not performance critical and makes info human 
readable... Whether existing text parsers are any good or not, I don't 
care, write a better one if you don't like the existing one or go beat up 
the people who wrote the bad ones... That seems to be Martin's standard 
reply, so I thought I would use it, too. (-;
Best regards,
