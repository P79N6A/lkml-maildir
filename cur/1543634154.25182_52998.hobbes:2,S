   Not that, I hope.  Possibly it's the interaction between
   block_write_full_pages's memset outside i_size, truncate and lookup.
   It took me a ridiculous amount of time to get that "correct", so
   it's a suspicion point.   Or possibly locking between lookup and
   truncate (rmdir) and/or creat.
   
   Dave, I assume this is with 8k pages and 4k blocks?
   
Yes, that is the case here.
   Is it repeatable enough to conduct a little experiment?  Like, lock the page
   in ext2_find_entry?
   
I'll try out your patch and get back to you, thanks.
Franks a lot,
