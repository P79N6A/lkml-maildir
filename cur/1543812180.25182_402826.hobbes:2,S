That's actually the reason for the existence of the uss720 driver. I'm
using it occasionally to program PIC microcontrollers.
This method is quite slow compared to a southbridge parport. But there
have been huge improvements to the speed and reliability in the last
couple of years. Kudos to Greg KH, Alan Stern, David Brownell et al.!
