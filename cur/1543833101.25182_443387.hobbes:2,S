Hi,
I saw many references to RLIMIT_RT_CPU (e.g. in
http://lwn.net/Articles/120797/
 ) as a way of limiting the amount of CPU
an unprivileged task can use at real-time priority. My understand was
that the feature had been merged into 2.6.12 as part of Ingo's rt-limit
patches. Unfortunately, I can't find any reference to that on my system
(latest Ubuntu), so I'm wondering where it's gone. Has it been removed,
renamed, ...? Considering that Ubuntu Dapper currently allows any user
to make unlimited use of realtime scheduling, this feature would be
really useful to prevent user apps from accidently crashing the system.
Thanks,
	Jean-Marc
