Your analysis is very good but not complete :)
There are different kind of hot cache lines, depending if they are :
- Mostly read
- read/written
Say you move to read mostly most of struct kmem_cache *, they are guaranteed 
to stay in 'mostly read'.
Mixing for example filp_cachep and dcache_lock in the same cache line is not a 
good thing. And this is what happening on typical kernel :
c04f15f0 B dcache_lock
c04f15f4 B names_cachep
c04f15f8 B filp_cachep
c04f15fc b rename_lock
I do think we should have defined a special section for very hot (and written) 
spots. It's more easy to locate thos hot spots than 'mostly read and shared by 
all cpus without cache ping pongs' places...
