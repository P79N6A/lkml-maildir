Hmm.. A sufficient fix for that might be kernel/fork.c:
        if ((clone_flags & CLONE_VFORK) || !(clone_flags & CLONE_PARENT))
                p->p_pptr = p->p_opptr = current;
would instead become
	p->p_opptr = current;
	if (!(clone_flags & CLONE_PARENT))
		p->p_pptr = current;
ie the original parent would _always_ be the "real" parent - which is what
CLONE_VFORK has to use anyway, but CLONE_PARENT would make the "logical
parent" be the same as the cloner. This should make debugging happy (the
debugger stays as the logical parent), yet should be ok for pthreads like
behaviour too, ie the reason for CLONE_PARENT in the first place.
Comments?
