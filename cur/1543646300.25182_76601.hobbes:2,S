I agree it's a total racket. I've spent an appalling amount of money on 
this stuff over the years considering how simple it is. Last year I 
finally built mtx, the open source tape library driver, and wrote my own 
software in tcl scripts for a new archiving system. It really is that 
simple, I don't know how they can charge so much for thier software, 
especially when some it is junk to begin with.
