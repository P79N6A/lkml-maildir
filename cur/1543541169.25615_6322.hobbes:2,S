Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.0-test6-pre9 and exit_mmap count is -5...

Hi Linus,
  I'm not MM guru, but before I added 'mm->mmap_avl = NULL' into kernel/fork.c,
I was not able to run xterm. Kernel spewed out exit_mmap: map count is 5 
or exit_mmap: map count is -5 and xterm died after keypress.
  My idea is that when mm is copied with memcpy, mmap_avl is not cleared when
process doing fork() has more than 32VMAs, so update VMA code then merges parent
tree with newly built child and wrong things happens (printk here found about
5 occurences of non-NULL mmap_avl during boot...). After this I can run xterm, 
but as I said, I'm not MM guru.
  Second hunk here I already sent you today morning, it is here only for completness
as I'm ccing this to linux-kernel too.
