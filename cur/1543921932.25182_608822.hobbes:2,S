Subject: [PATCH]NFS: Fix for bug in handling of errors for O_DIRECT writes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/23/396

From: Neil Brown <neilb@suse.de>
commit eda3cef8dd2b838 ensured that if a WRITE returns an error, then
data->res.verf->committed is not tested (as it is not initialised).
commit 60fa3f769f inadvertently reverted this while fixing other problems.
So move the test so that we never examine ->committed in an error
case, and fix a speeling error while we are there.

Note: only compile tested - I haven't tried triggering the bug yet.
