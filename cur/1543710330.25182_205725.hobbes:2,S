I'd thought we'd been careful about this.  You're suggesting that the
size of this structure has changed between kernel versions ?!
struct dm_ioctl {
        uint32_t version[3];
        uint32_t data_size;
        uint32_t data_start;
        uint32_t target_count;
        int32_t open_count;
        uint32_t flags;
        uint32_t event_nr;
        uint32_t padding;
        uint64_t dev;
        char name[DM_NAME_LEN];
        char uuid[DM_UUID_LEN];
};
