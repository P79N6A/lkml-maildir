Two very important things to consider:
The LSM is designed to be a restrictive mechanism. An LSM module
is not allowed to grant access that would be denied by usual
mechanisms. There are composition problems, but nothing that is
worse than the problems you have to deal with when a filesystem
is mounted read-only. True, one LSM module could muck with the
data used by another, but that's something you can do today with
setxattr() calls in an application.
Which brings up the second important point. The argument above
has nothing whatever to do with mechanisms provided by the kernel
and everything to do with the privileged applications used to
administer a system. Those applications need to be written so as
to deal properly with unexpected access failures, such as might
be induced by a filesystem mounted read-only or being full. I
am aware of the Holy Grail of a security package that does not
interfere with the operation of "normal" administration. How close
you can come to that in independent of wether your kernel is
an integrated "security solution" or a collection of composed
modules.
This discussion is amazingly disconnected from the issues of LSM.
