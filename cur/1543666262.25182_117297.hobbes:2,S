Hi Michael,
The Seagate ST336607LW has firmware: 0004.
Seagate have stated to me that this is the latest.
They have also stated to me:
  Issuing an unrecognized or illegal command to the drive can cause the
  drive to go into a hardware fault mode where it will no longer respond,
  and may or may not respond to a SCSI BUS reset. It seems, in this case,
  the drive will no longer respond to any commands issued by the
  controller.
Is this "feature" now common on SCSI drives ????
