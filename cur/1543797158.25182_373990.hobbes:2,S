That seems at least slightly better, as it involves all the bits.  
Question - what is rule for "Signed-off-by:"?  I'm hesitant to add that if
I haven't actually compiled+tested a fix, as I've seen too many instances
of "obvious fix contains bug" to believe visual inspection is enough.  If
"Signed-off-by:" simply indicates "Yes, this person approves of the change
in principle" then that's OK by me.  Andrew, do you use the "CC" tag for
that?
