Unfortunately my machines only have SCSI devices, so I'd have no way
to actually test a patch, otherwise I'd be happy to give it a shot - a
parameter to disable the behaviour shouldn't be too difficult to
implement, and if the default stays as the current behaviour then it
shouldn't be too controversial.
I wouldn't mind trying to hack up a patch, but it would be untested...
