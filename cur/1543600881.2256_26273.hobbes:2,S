Here's some anectdotal evidence to the contrary.
This machine requires about 1.5 seconds to diff two kernel trees if both 
trees are in cache.  If neither tree is in cache it takes 90 seconds.  It's a 
total of about 300M of source - reading that into memory should take about 10 
seconds at 30M/sec, taking one pass across the disk and assuming no extensive 
fragmentation.
We lost 78.5 seconds somewhere.  From the sound of the disk drives, I'd say 
we lost it to seeking, which physical readahead with a large cache would be 
able to largely eliminate in this case.
