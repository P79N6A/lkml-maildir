   I'm not familiar enough with the tcp code to know if this patch
   (against -ac6) is a solution, band-aid, or, in fact, wrong, but
   I've run with it (on -ac3) and haven't seen the errors for over
   twelve hours, which is three times longer than it had been able to
   go without it coming up.
See the fix I put in 2.4.1-pre2, which is:
