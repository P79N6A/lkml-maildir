But it will also be killed.

Yeah, I think 'try' is definitely be a misnomer in this case.
How about something like this ?
static inline void __module_get(struct module *mod)
{
#ifdef CONFIG_MODULE_DETECT_API_VIOLATION
        if (!module_refcount(mod))
                __unsafe(mod);
#endif
        local_inc(&mod->ref[get_cpu()].count);
        put_cpu();
}
We will be able to compile the kernel with CONFIG_MODULE_DETECT_API_VIOLATION
and easily find all modules that call __module_get() without holding a reference.
Comments ?
