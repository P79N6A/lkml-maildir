Thanks a lot :-) I will do my best to ensure it stays in good shape
during the -rc series.

It might actually make more sense to fold the first two into the avr32
architecture patch. Especially now that David has picked up the third
one (which ended up not being AVR32-specific at all.)
The static memory controller driver isn't really specific to MTD
anyway, it should be equally useful for all kinds of external
memory-mapped devices including CompactFlash.
