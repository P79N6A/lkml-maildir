And I can always change that to 2.9.5 or whatever if necessary ;-).

This doesn't make a whole lot of sense IMHO.  You're afraid of forcing
people to upgrade to the latest binutils, so instead you want to force
everyone to install yet *another*, even more obscure package to compile
their kernel?  Just to pick at least one prominent distribution, at least
Red Hat 6 doesn't even ship NASM on the CD.
Personally, I'm all in favor of switching to gas and dropping the as86
requirement.  But then, I'm biased in that I don't code assember....
later,
chris
