Not if it's there, no. But if the hardware doesn't actually exist on the 
machine, and you can't probe for it, it may be better to say "hey, I'll 
share interrupts, because I don't know if I actually exist or not" ;)

Well, that actually _is_ something we can probe for: "does this machine 
have PCI". 
IOW, we could have a trivial "if the list of PCI devices is non-empty, 
then return immediately" kind of thing, no?
That would mean that (pretty much) anybody loading that driver by mistake
wouldn't get into trouble.
