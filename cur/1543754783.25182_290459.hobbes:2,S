It's worth noting that some users have found the randomisation disable useful
for running things like xine/mplayer etc with win32 codecs that seem
to just segfault otherwise.  These things seem to be incredibly fragile
to address space layout changes, which is a good argument for trying to
avoid these wierdo formats where possible in favour of free codecs.
