I don't think most kernel developers are likely to favor an approach
which smashes a bunch of unrelated data together.  Linux syscall
overhead is incredibly low, so I don't see it being much of a problem.
On the other hand, a simple syscall which smashes together a bunch of
related data would not be that big of an issue either.  Let's wait for
Namesys to tinker and come back with a new patch before commenting
further.

software stuff and not get a real job. Charles Shultz had the best  
answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do it
because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't.  
That's why
I draw cartoons. It's my life."
