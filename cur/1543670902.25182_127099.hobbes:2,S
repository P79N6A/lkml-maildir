 But:
    `-'
          "Subtraction".  If the right argument is absolute, the result
          has the section of the left argument.  If both arguments are
          in the same section, the result is absolute.  You may not
          subtract arguments from different sections.

 This is a bug in gas.  Please check if it is reproducible with the latest
release (2.13.2.1) and if so, then file a bug report to
<bug-binutils@gnu.org>.
