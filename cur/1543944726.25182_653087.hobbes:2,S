I'm sure I understand only less than half of what you said.
My current understanding is that all the aspects of your proposal that  
are interesting for me can be summarized as follows:
- your tree stops compiling at the beginning of the merge window when 
  you merge the first subsystem tree
- your tree might compile again at the end of the merge window when you
  merge the last subsystem tree 
- git-bisect -> /dev/null
What do I miss?
