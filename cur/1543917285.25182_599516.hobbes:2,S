It seems there are (at least) two parts to this, one regarding changing 
working directory which is clearly stated in the standards and must work 
as it does, and the various issues regarding getting out of the chroot 
after the cwd has entered that changed root. That second part seems to 
offer room for additional controls on getting out of the chroot which do 
not violate any of the obvious standards, and which therefore might be 
valid candidates for discussion on the basis of benefit rather than 
portability.
