i'm wondering too.
in my posted debugging answer, instead of replying privately to Rob, i 
have also Cc:-ed lkml and ck-list. (perhaps i shouldnt even have Cc:-ed 
the lists, as my posted debugging questions and suggestions were mostly 
relevant to Rob and to me - but it's better to keep such things archived 
on the lists, if someone wants to read them. In the first mail i also 
Cc:-ed Mike and Peter who changed the scheduler recently - but i dropped 
them after my first reply when it became apparent that it's not their 
changes that are affected. With all lists still Cc:-ed, so that people 
can follow it if they really want to.)
I'd expect any new results to be posted by Rob to everyone he wishes to 
send them to - like he did it in the past.
Or is Oleg perhaps complaining about the fact that i Cc:-ed this back to 
both affected email lists, for everyone to read? Would be a weird 
argument.
