>>            Summary: kernel hangs when trying to read atip wiith cdrecord
>>     Kernel Version: 2.6.16.1
>> Most recent kernel where this bug did not occur: 2.6.16.1 (yes, the 
>> same version - it works with my dvd-burner, but not with my cd-burner), 
>> the 2.4 series worked with both, but there I have been using ide-scsi)
Can you try a newer version and/or (or both) with an original cdrecord (if 
not already done so) or cdrecord-prodvd?
>> Distribution: Mandriva 9.0 based
>> cdrtools 2.01.01a10
>> Steps to reproduce:
>> I simply try to use "cdrecord dev=ATAPI:1,0,0 -atip" as root.
>> # cdrecord dev=ATAPI:1,0,0 -atip
Try -dev=/dev/hdX
