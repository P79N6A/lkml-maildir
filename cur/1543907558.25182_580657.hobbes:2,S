From a purely practical standpoint: it's a concern that all filesytems need
patching to continue to correctly function after this change.  There might
be filesystems which you missed, and there are out-of-tree filesystems
which won't be updated.
And I think the impact upon the out-of-tree filesystems would be fairly
severe: they quietly and subtly get their secutiry guarantees broken (I
think?)
Is there any way in which we can prevent these problems?  Say
- rename something so that unconverted filesystems will reliably fail to
  compile?
- leave existing filesystems alone, but add a new
  inode_operations.setattr_jeff, which the networked filesytems can
  implement, and teach core vfs to call setattr_jeff in preference to
  setattr?
Something else?
