In fact, this is not entirely theoretical. I know people _have_ noticed, 
because I've gotten queries from some projects that wanted to copy the 
definitions for their alpha port. I only got those queries because my name 
is on the file, and those people wanted to actually copy them, not just 
include the header file. I don't know _how_ many people decided to just 
do the #include.
There are probably more people familiar with the kernel source tree than 
with GLIB which is probably the preferred way to do those things these 
days. And a few years ago that choice wasn't even there.
