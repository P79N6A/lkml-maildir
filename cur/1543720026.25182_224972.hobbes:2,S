Yes.  It would add ~4k (if you want to do it for the init sections as
well as the core sections of the module: might not be worth it).
You can set the alignment requirement in module_frob_arch_sections(),
but beware that this alignment will only be relative to the allocation
returned by module_alloc(), so to do this you'll want module_alloc() to
return page-aligned memory.
Note the section sorting done in kernel/module.c:layout_sections(): in
particular, all executable sections are placed FIRST in the module,
which makes your life easier here.
Hope that helps!
Rusty.
