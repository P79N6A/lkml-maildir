I am writing to announce the availability of the first draft of
the CE Linux Forum's first specification.  This specification
represents the efforts of six different technical working groups
over about the last 9 months.
The specification is available at:
http://tree.celinuxforum.org/docs/CELF_Specification_V_1_0_R1-1.pdf
The specification is also available online, and individual pages
may be viewed on the forum wiki, at:
http://tree.celinuxforum.org/pubwiki/moin.cgi/FrontPage
Included in the document are specifications or notes on technologies
in the areas of:
  - Bootup time reduction
  - Power management
  - Audio/Video/Graphics
  - Realtime features
  - System size reduction
  - Security
Please see the introduction of the document for more details on the
scope and purpose of the document.  Some of the technologies mentioned
in the document are already integrated into 2.6.  You should start
to see others submitted here individually for your consideration
in the near future.
Please note that this draft has not yet been approved or ratified
by the forum at this time.
Any and all feedback is welcome, via either the forum's public
mailing list at celinux-dev@tree.celinuxforum.org, or on this list.
Thanks,
