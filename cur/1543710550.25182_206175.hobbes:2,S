Perhaps in some sense, but not in any interesting sense.
For the average computer you can buy at your supermarket today it isn't 
very interesting whether the kernel is bigger by 1 MB or not.
People who need to care about the size of the kernel [1] use hand-tuned 
.config's that are far away from defconfig - and those people wouldn't 
enable unneeded features that are on by default.
You use a metric "size increase of a defconfig kernel [2]", and I simply 
claim that this metric doesn't measure anything useful for practical 
purposes.
