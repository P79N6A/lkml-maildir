Wouldn't having (practically) all your memory used for cache slow down
starting a new program? First it would have to free up that space, and then
put stuff in that space, taking potentially twice as long. I think there
should be a system call for freeing cached memory, for those that do want to
do it.

Free memory is bad, it means the memory doesn't have a proper use.
Cached memory will be freed automatically when the kernel needs memory
for other (more important) things.
