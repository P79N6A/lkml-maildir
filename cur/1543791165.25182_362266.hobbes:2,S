The Blackfin/uClinux 2.6.x patch which was prepared (and will be 
maintained) by a separate team(1) who is not working on any fusiv 
processors (which are MIPS-based).

Not sure - Since the two groups are separate, no one on the team here knows 
the plans of the Fusiv team.

So, the best place to go would be to Sagem (or any company shipping a 
product with Embedded Linux/uClinux). Since they are responsible for 
distributing the binary, it is their responsibility to make the source 
released under GPL or derived from previously GPL'ed software available.
If you received a product from Sagem, which you believe includes GPL'ed 
software - call them and ask for the source:
http://www.sagem.com/index.php?id=445&L=0
If you received a development kit, or other reference design from ADI, 
which you believe includes GPL'ed software, call them and ask for the source:

(1)There is a small group of open source developers inside of ADI, focusing 
on the support of the Blackfin processor with various open source projects. 
We have people dedicated to:
  - the FSF's Toolchain (gcc, gdb, binutils) where our patches have
     been accepted into the mainline projects (still working on the
     last kinks gdb pthreads support).
  - Das U-Boot as our chip initialization and bootloader. Booting from the
     network is very powerful in many embedded environments.
  - the GNU/uClinux kernel (Luke's recent patch for 2.6.14), where end
     products are beginning to ship in volume.
  - open source hardware design - free (speech) software isn't any good
     on closed hardware. All of our schematics, gerbers, PCB manufacturing
     files are released under the GPL, and are mostly avalible from
     Digikey, at sub $225 price points.
  - Simulation support with Skyeye

Our team completely embraces the open source model (release early, release 
often) - using open source tools (GForge, Tinderbox, cvs, dokuwiki), 
publishing everything we do/understand on the web(2). We have been 
responsible for contributions in other open source projects:
   - helped port Linux Test Project (LTP) so it could run on a
      uClinux/uclibc/no-mmu environment
   - helped port Speex to the Blackfin, to run a completely open
       source embedded VoIP phone, based on Linphone.
   - helping update uClinux-dist to other main-line projects.
   - others, but I am starting to get a little wordy.
The combination of Blackfin/uClinux is pretty compelling - the hardware(3) 
has a pretty good span of price(as low as $4.95)/performance(BF561 include 
Dual Core, 600MHz each) & I won't go into the benefits of uClinux and open 
source here :)
If anyone is interested in looking at things running on real hardware, I do 
have a limited amount of hardware I can lend people for poking/porting. 
Some of the things we have working are pretty cool[4]. Send me a private email.
