I think I see the source of the confusion.  Scrubbing is the
process of taking data that is correctable and writing it back to
memory so that if a second correctable error occurs the net is still
corrected.
Directed killing of processes is something that must be done
inside a synchronous exception (like a machine check) because otherwise
it is so racy you don't know who has seen the bad data.
