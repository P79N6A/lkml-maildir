it has countless advantages, and these days we basically only design 
per-CPU data structures within the kernel, unless some limitation (such 
as API or hw property) forces us to do otherwise. So i turn around the 
question: what would be your reason for _not_ doing this clean per-CPU 
design for SMP systems?

yeah, and that's an assumption that simplifies things on SMP 
significantly. PIT on SMP systems for HRT is so gross that it's not 
funny. If anyone wants to revive that notion, please do a separate patch 
and make the case convincing enough ...
