If the embedded struct fdtable is used, then the only touched field is 
'next_fd', so we could also move this field at the end of 'struct fdtable'
But I wonder if 'next_fd' really has to be in 'struct fdtable', maybe it could 
be moved to 'struct files_struct' close to file_lock ?
If yes, the whole embedded struct fdtable is readonly.
