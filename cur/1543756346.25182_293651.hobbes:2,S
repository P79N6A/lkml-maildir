The attack is to hardlink some tempfile name to some file you want over-written.
This usually involves just a little bit of work, such as recognizing that a given
root cronjob uses an unsafe predictable filename in /tmp (look at the Bugtraq or
Full-Disclosure archives, there's plenty).  Then you set a little program that
sleep()s till a few seconds before the cronjob runs, does a getpid(), and then
sprays hardlinks into the next 15 or 20 things that mktemp() will generate...
Consider how bash implements "here" scripts:
#!/bin/bash
echo << EOF
some trash
EOF
Now let's look at the strace (snipped for brevity..)

Wow - if my /tmp was on the same partition, and I'd hard-linked that
file to /etc/passwd, it would be toast now if root had run it.
You usually can't control what gets written - but often it's sufficient for the
attacker to simply get a file clobbered....
