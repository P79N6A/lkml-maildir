The patch solves the problem. I'm writing this after the third suspend
and resume cycle.
msi irq stays enabled for libata device:

BUT...
The first suspend to disk is ok. The second suspend to disk has a
strange behaviour:
1.) write pm image
2.) the system disable the non-boot cpus again (i guess this happens in
power_down())
3.) the system doesn't power down.
4.) pressing any key and the system powers down.
The same is true for the third suspend cycle. Maybe an acpi problem?
