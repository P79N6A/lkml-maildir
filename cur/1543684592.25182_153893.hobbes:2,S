Alan sent my ikconfig patch to Linus a couple of days ago and it's
in 2.6.0-test-current ... except for the Kconfig part of it,
which Alan or I will send soon (if Alan hasn't already done so).
The full was (which is partially merged) is at
  
http://developer.osdl.org/rddunlap/patches/ikconfig/ikconfig_260c.patch
It includes a script (extract-ikconfig) and a small C program
(binoffsets.c) that are used to extract the saved .config image.
The .config file is also available in /proc as a CONFIG option.
