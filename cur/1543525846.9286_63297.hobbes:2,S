Well I use fat as a module, and autofs, and a second linux partition
mounted with autofs, OK:
1- I dowloaded some files to the root partition, then I copied it to a
vfat partition, then they didn't uncompres, but in the root partition it
will do. Even a text file of 695 bytes seemed to be corrupted, after a
reboot the files where ok.
2- sometimes when I compile something in the second partition (autofs
mounted) it stops with error "i/o error" and make saying that there is
no target, at this momento I do: cd .. ; rm -rf dir, and then i can't
delete dir with I/O error in one or more files. Umount, e2fsck and it
gets "short reads" (whatever it'll mean), reboot to 2.3.22 and e2fsck
fix it (whiout short reads), I think it began in 2.3.40, 2.3.44 exhibits
this behaviour also, so it does .41 .42 .43, have to test .45, just
dowloaded...
I only found one program segfault in the same condition, it was
prep-tabs2 from one tv descrambling package.
