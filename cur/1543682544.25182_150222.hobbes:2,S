Subject: 2.6.0-test1: "make help" is not complete

  just an observation -- "make help" doesn't list all possible
make options.  minimally, "make randconfig" is not listed there,
although i'm not surprised that this feature is not prominently
advertised. :-)
  there might be others as well that are not listed, i wasn't
trying to be exhaustive.
