It's not particularly related to your suggestion, but it is related to the 
preceding email.  I just replied to the latest message in the thread to 
make sure that my reply was sent to anyone who might be interested, that's 
all.
In any case, I'm not so sure to what extent you can separate out the
disable-legacy stuff from the rest.  It's not good enough to disable
interrupt generation and bus-mastering; some controllers don't like it if
you do that while they are running.  It's necessary to shut the controller
down first.  And it looks like the code does just that -- there's not much 
else to separate out.
