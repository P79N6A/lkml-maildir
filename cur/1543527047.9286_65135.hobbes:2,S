Also sprach Borislav Deianov:

} The linux/list.h implementation is a bit weird at first (at least I
} found it so) but is perfectly adequate and very neat once you get used
} to it. Here is your example program rewritten to use linux/list.h
} (modulo insertion/traversal order - easily changeable):
} 
} ------------------------ <list.c> ------------------------
} #include <stdio.h>
} #include "list.h"
} 
} struct node {
} 	int data;
} 	struct list_head list;
} };
} 
} int main(void)
} {
} 	struct list_head queue, *tmp;
} 	struct node n1, n2, n3;
} 	n1.data = 1;
} 	n2.data = 2;
} 	n3.data = 3;
} 
} 	INIT_LIST_HEAD(&queue);
} 	list_add(&n1.list, &queue);
} 	list_add(&n2.list, &queue);
} 	list_add(&n3.list, &queue);
} 	tmp = queue.next;
} 	while(tmp != &queue) {
} 		struct node *n = list_entry(tmp, struct node, list);
} 		printf("%d\n", n->data);
} 		tmp = tmp->next;
} 	}
} 	list_del(&n2.list);
} 	list_del(&n1.list);
} 	list_del(&n3.list);
} }
Our design team has something similar to what this looks like. One thing
we had which was nice, it was a FOREACH() macro. Does the above code:
	tmp = queue.next;
	while (tmp != &queue) {
		/* blah */
		tmp = tmp->next;
	}
occur frequently enough to warrent such a beast?
