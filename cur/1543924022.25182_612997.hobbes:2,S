I tried to recreate your problem using 2.6.23-1 and latest rt patch (rt5).
The problem is that the kernel is not stable at all, I can't even 
compile the code over vnc -
my connection is constantly lost. So it might not be kvm problem?
Can you try is with -no-kvm and see if it's working - then its just a 
regular userspace process.
Anyway if all other things are stable on your end, can you send us 
dmesg/strace outputs?
Also try without the good -no-kvm-irqchip.
Regards,
Dor.
