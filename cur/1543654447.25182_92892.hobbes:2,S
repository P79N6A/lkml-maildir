Um, device table support went back in .49, at Adam's request (grand
plans are great and all that, but other maintainers are busy too, and
it'll take a while to get the new scheme sorted out).  You just have to
run depmod -a to generate the .xxxmap files.
The patch included in the 0.8 NEWS file allows the new depmod to
generate the tables too.
