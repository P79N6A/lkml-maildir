Alan,
I think all things being equal, linux today is **GREAT** technology.  Yes,
it did break Caldera's Netware stuff (It's still busted, I have to do a lot
of work on 2.0.35 then move it to a 2.2.9 box to test).  I also think alot
of the work being done with the Page Cache is totally **KICK ASS**.  I'm
just saying we should try to assess the impact on the commercial Linux
vendors, and try to give them adequate warning, but progress also has a
price and I agree it's difficult tightrope to walk.
After all, you cannot make an omlette without breaking a few eggs.
Jeff
