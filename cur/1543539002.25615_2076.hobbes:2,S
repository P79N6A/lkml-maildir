The user-mode port of 2.4.0-test4 is available.
It's been updated to 2.4.0-test4.
The rest of the changes are bug fixes.  The two big bugs fixed are the one 
that prevented it from running on newer kernels due to the increased size of 
the signal stack frame and the one that caused a hang when run with a 
stacksize limit that's not a multiple of 4 meg.  If you're interested, see 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/diary.html
 for more complete 
descriptions of these problems.
