#define pci_register_driver(d) __pci_register_driver(d, THIS_MODULE)
#define ide_pci_register_driver(d) __ide_pci_register_driver(d, THIS_MODULE)
__pci_register_driver(drv, module) - same as current pci_register_driver(),
except that instead of
        drv->driver.owner = drv->owner;
it does
        drv->driver.owner = module;
__ide_pci_register_driver(driver, module):
{
        if(!pre_init)
                return __pci_register_driver(driver, module);
	driver->driver.owner = module;
        list_add_tail(&driver->node, &ide_pci_drivers);
        return 0;
}
and in ide_scan_pcibus() turn
                pci_register_driver(d);
into
		__pci_register_driver(d, d->driver.owner);
Update exports (i.e. export __pci_register_driver and __ide_pci_register_driver
instead of pci_register_driver and ide_pci_register_driver resp.).
At which point pci_driver->owner become unused and can be killed at leisure.
Objections?
