Isn't there a runtime cost converting all "non-false" values to a unique "true" (i.e. converting non-zero values to one) ?
I mean:
bool res = strcmp(string, "whatever");
if(res)
	something_else();
... will convert res to 0 or 1, which is totally useless except perhaps for comprehension (and again, not for Al Viro for example :)
