I see. Is there something we'll need to do? Or is it just for the day?

Because we still want to keep up the old list? If _head->next was NULL, no 
matter, we've added. If not, we've just inserted.

I'd rather call them push_slist, pop_slist (or as above). Think of the 
millions of innocent people mixing lists and lists...

This is perfect evolution. You end up having better code-checking, and a 
third hand.

We shall have a look at the assembler output.

Must be forced then. Is it really that bad?

We shall comment on them to reduce uglyness.
Summary:
 - We shall do it
 - We shall force it
 - We shall consider using slist names.
