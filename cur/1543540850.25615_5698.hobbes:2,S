Yes. I sent out a patch for this two months ago - forgot
whether it was to Andre, Alan or Linus, but I see that
2.4.0test5 does not contain it. There are several issues
here, and it may be that this is not yet the final truth,
but one aspect is that fs/partitions/msdos.c uses ide_xlate_1024
precisely when CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE is defined.
So, ide-geometry.c must provide this routine precisely when
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE is defined.
(All I see so far are attempts to surround ide-geometry.c
with suitable defines, but that is wrong since the routine
probe_cmos_for_drives() is used under entirely different
circumstances.)
