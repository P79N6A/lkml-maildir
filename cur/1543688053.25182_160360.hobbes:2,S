OK, sorry for the noise.  It appears that this is due to the AIO patches in
-mm.  fsx-linux fails instantly on nfsv3 to localhost on XFS.  It's OK on
ext2 for some reason.
Binary searching reveals that the offending patch is
O_SYNC-speedup-nolock-fix.patch
testcase:
	mkfs.xfs -f /dev/hda5
	mount /dev/hda5 /mnt/hda5
	chmod a+rw /mnt/hda5
	service nfs start
	mount localhost:/mnt/hda5 /mnt/localhost
	cd /mnt/localhost
	fsx-linux foo
