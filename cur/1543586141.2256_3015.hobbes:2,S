Hi,
Thanks!!! That worked.  Now I have one more problem... I am using non
blcking sockets (set via fcntl).
And I am using select (with a 20 second timeout) to see when data is
available on the socket.  I have 600 clients hitting my web server.
Quite frequently, what happens is that some of the sockets that I am waiting
on in the select (read or write) just dont have any activity in them for
more than 20 seconds or so.... its like the client never sent any data over
or is still waiting to connect.
What could I be doing wrong (what are the common mistakes?)
Thanks
Lee

If you use INADDR_ANY in your sockaddr struct that you pass to bind,
instead of your IP address, it should listen on all network interfaces.
