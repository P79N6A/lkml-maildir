I'm not sure why [*], because this should be preventing it..
                if (num_online_cpus() != 1) {
                        printk(KERN_ERR PFX "MP systems not supported by PSB BIOS structure\n");
                        kfree(data);
                        return -ENODEV;
                }
num_online_cpus will return 2 in a dual-core system, even though there's
just one socket.  Given they share a power plane, if there's a valid
PSB structure however, it may be usable.  Though this isn't necessarily
true for all future dual-core AMD CPUs, and the ACPI tables really
should be preferred.
