With small MTU or when driver does not support fragmented allocation
(iirc at least forcedeth does not) skb will contain all the data in the
linear part and thus will be copied in the kernel. read()/write() does
effectively the same, but in userspace.
This should only affect splice usage which involves socket->pipe data
transfer.

Does splice without patches (but with performance improvement for
non-blocking splice) has the same performance? It does not copy data,
but you may hit the data corruption? If performance is the same, this
maybe indeed HW limitation.
