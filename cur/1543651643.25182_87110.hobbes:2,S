I've been getting more and more people talking to me looking to pay people to 
fix small Linux bugs but having problems finding smaller companies. Obviously
wanting to send $1000 to have someone fix a driver simply doesn't work when
you talk to big companies.
One thing the FSF do which is rather sensible is keep a list in the packages
of people who you can pay to fix stuff in them. I asked on Linux-kernel
and got a small initial set of company responses. hopefully more will appear
once its merged.
The order is alphabetical logically enough
[Marcelo this seems to apply cleanly to 2.4 as well]
