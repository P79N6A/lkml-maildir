From: Christoph Lameter <>
Subject: [RFC 2/7] Move checks from pageout() to shrink_page_list
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/20/306

This is necessary because we soon will do other things than calling
pageout() from shrink_page_list().
