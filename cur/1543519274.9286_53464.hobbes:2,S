I would have bought RHAT at around $14 but I got screwed on the price
change. (They had to reissue the IPO shares on E-Trade). IMHO, the only
reason redhat has such high demand is because people think that Linux is
Redhat like people think that the Internet is AOL. God forbid they should
learn of debian, slackware, or *gasp* installing/using linux completely
free.
