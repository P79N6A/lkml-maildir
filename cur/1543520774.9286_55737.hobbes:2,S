[SNIPPED reasonable code]
Well it's usually not a 'lockup' it's usually what hardware __does__,
i.e., fail to interrupt, etc. So my proposal will allow you to work-around
the hardware which usually has to be done anyway. It's either 'you missed
the interrupt` or 'the interrupt never happened`. Both cases allow you
to get control.
Cheers,
