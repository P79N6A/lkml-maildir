I think it is was fixed by this one:
----
    Do not replace whole memcpy in apply alternatives
    
    apply_alternatives uses memcpy() to apply alternatives.  Which has the
    unfortunate effect that while applying memcpy alternative to memcpy
    itself it tries to overwrite itself with nops - which causes #UD fault
    as it overwrites half of an instruction in copy loop, and from this
    point on only possible outcome is triplefault and reboot.
