Im not saying that the multiqueue scheduler patch isn't needed, just that
this test case is caused by a bug in postgres. We shouldn't run around
fixing symptoms - dropping the contention in the runqueue lock might not
change the overall performance of the benchmark, on the other hand
fixing the spinlocks in postgres probably will.
On the other hand, if postgres still pounds on the runqueue lock after
the bug has been fixed then we need to look at the multiqueue patch.
Cheers,
Anton
