Ok i changed it to conform to the gospel. I gave it some basic pounding LTP/dd IO with 
and without IOMMU force, but it's not that well tested. More testing welcome.

Don't touch the non DMA members in the sg list in dma_map_sg in the IOMMU
Some drivers (in particular ipr) ran into problems because they
reused the sg lists after passing them to pci_map_sg(). The merging
procedure in the K8 GART IOMMU corrupted the state. This patch
changes it to only touch the dma* entries during merging,
but not the other fields.  Approach suggested by Dave Miller.
I did some basic tests with CONFIG_IOMMU_DEBUG (LTP, large dd) 
and without and it hold up, but needs more testing.
