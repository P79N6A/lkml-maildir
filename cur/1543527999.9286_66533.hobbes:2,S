I think my own reply to Paul is causing more confusion than the code. 
The problem was that size_t was defined to be unconditionally 'unsigned
long', which makes the size correct for both 32- and 64-bit, but not the
type.
Paul was kind enough to "make this uglier", by conditionally making
size_t an 'unsigned int' on 32-bit PPC, and removing the -fno-builtin
flag from the build.  So, problem solved.  :)
