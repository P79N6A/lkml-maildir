Sibling makes sense if you look at the N processors in the package as
"siblings of each other" i.e. not a hierarchy (as subcore implies) but
just a "set of virtual processors in the same core".
If there are subcores, then I think there must be some major core.  If
two chips are siblings, then that merely says they are related (in this
case, the same parent package).
