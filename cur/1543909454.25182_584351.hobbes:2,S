While it seems to be generally customary to identify the authors of Documentation
files, it doesn't seem to be customary for them to assert a copyright.
Is this really necessary?  My concern is that it could discourage contributors
for user or changing the text in any way they see fit.
can anybody offer guidance on this?
thanks,
