  Yes, this can happen. The call to mark_buffer_dirty() is a fallout
from journal_unfile_buffer() trying to sychronise JBD private dirty bit
(jbddirty) with the standard dirty bit. We could actually clear the
jbddirty bit before calling journal_unfile_buffer() so that this doesn't
happen but since Linus changed remove_from_pagecache() to not care about
redirtying the page I guess it's not needed any more...
