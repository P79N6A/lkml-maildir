So?  You take the superblock lock on the host, you allocate, you drop
the lock.  Unless there are any recursion situations where you need to
access a lock on the local machine while holding that remote superblock
lock, you just have normal synchronisation locking without deadlock.
And yes, the kpiod thread added in 2.2.2 does eliminate a whole class of
such locking deadlocks.  We no longer have any way for memory allocation
requirements on the host to trigger a deadlocking lock recursion back to
the client.  I really meant it when I said that our VM is much more
robust now.

2.3 is undergoing sufficiently rapid evolution right now that I'd not
take that as meaningful until the source of the deadlock is found!

OK.  we can definitely look into this, but the fact remains that I don't
know of any _fundamental_ reasons why we cannot do sparse loopback right
now.  The VM infrastructure is resistant to those deadlocks.

Yes.  There _are_ pretty simple ways to fix this, btw, but adding a
separate clean-page-reaper thread to kswapd is probably too dangerous
for 2.2.
