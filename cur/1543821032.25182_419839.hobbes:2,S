I wonder if they should be CLONE_* at all.  Given that we are likely
to run out of free CLONE_* bits, unshare will have to reuse bits that
don't have anything to do with sharing resources (CSIGNAL,
CLONE_VFORK, etc), and it doesn't seem that nice to have two different
CLONE_* flags with the same value, different meaning, only one of
which can actually be used in clone.
It seems better to use UNSHARE_*, with the current bits that are
common to unshare and clone being defined the same, i.e.
	#define UNSHARE_VM CLONE_VM
