Yes, we know which one too :-)

It's not as inefficient as you think.
Instead of naive quoting, say `\' before every delimiter and `\' itself,
think like this:
Each read-in block is quoted by a header saying "this next N bytes is
taken literally", followed by the unquoted data for N bytes.
If this is generated on the fly, we can choose N such that
sizeof(header)+N == 3rd argument to read() [or smaller].  We could
choose other values -- but then we'd have to accept the possibiltity of
padding if the underlying file is truncated while the on-the-fly file is
being read.
This way cat stays fast.  There is copying but no significant work
quoting -- and the copying is no more than required anyway to construct
these files on the fly.

Keeping it aligned is easy with my suggestion.
