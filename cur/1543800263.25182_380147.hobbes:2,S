Ingo, instead of having a static work area and using locking, why not just 
move those fields into the "z_stream" structure, and thus make them be 
per-stream? The z_stream structure should already be allocated with 
kmalloc() or similar by the caller, so that also gets it off the stack 
without the locking thing.
Hmm?
