....my apologies. I screwed up sending the patches through quilt.
anyway I have received the following comments from Andrew Morton, which
I will incorporate before sending out saner looking patches.
sorry again,
RP
Andrew's comments follows:
----------------------------------------
Frankly, I don't even know what these patches _do_, and haven't spent
the time to try to find out.
If these patches are merged, how do we expect end-users to find out how
to use the new capabilities?
A few paragraphs in the patch #1 changelog would help.  A high-level
description of the new capability which explains what it does and why it
would be a useful thing for Linux.
And maybe some deeper information in a Documentation/ file.
Right now, there might well be a lot of people who could use these new
features, but they don't even know that these patches provide them! 
It's all a bit of a mystery, really.
