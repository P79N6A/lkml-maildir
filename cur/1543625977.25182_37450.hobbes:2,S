There is a hardware bug on some via 686a systems where the RTC appears 
automagically change it's programmed value.
A patch was originally made against 2.4.2, and some version of this 
appears to be applied to current kernels (I don't have a vanilla 
2.4.17 to check against).  Look in arch/i386/kernel/time.c for mention 
of 686a.
It appears to only be used if the kernel's not compiled with 
CONFIG_X86_TSC though, so if you have that defined you may not see the 
problem at all...
