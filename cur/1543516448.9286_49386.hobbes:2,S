	That was it.  I used mem=40M and it came up just fine.
	The system _is_ handing out the lower 15M now with K4 - my
original problem is fixed.
	Just for grins, I tried mem=38M and the same BUG in
page_alloc.c:505 came up; perhaps the memory has to be a multiple of 4M?
	For reference, here is the memory size reported by an earlier
kernel (2.3.28 unpatched, I think):
totalpages: 00002830
Memory: 38668k/41152k available (0k kernel code, 0k reserved, 0k data, 0k
init, 0k highmem)
	With the current 2.3.28+2.3.28-K4:
Linux version 2.3.28 (root@sparrow.websense.net) (gcc version egcs-2.91.66
19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)) #8 Wed Nov 17 21:

totalpages: 00002800
zone(0): 4096 pages.
zone(1): 6144 pages.
zone(2): 0 pages.
Initializing CPU#0
Detected 90208196 Hz processor.
Console: colour VGA+ 80x25
Calibrating delay loop... 35.94 BogoMIPS
simple RAM-test ... passed.
Memory: 38388k/40960k available (933k kernel code, 2184k reserved, 77k
data, 60k init, 0k highmem)
	I take it those 30 pages will no longer be available?
	Thanks again for all your work.  Thanks also to Alan for his quick
spotting.
	Cheers,
	- Bill
