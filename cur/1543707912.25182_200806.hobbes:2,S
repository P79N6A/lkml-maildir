That was Ed.  Because we cannot reclaim slab pages direct from the LRU it
turned out that putting slab pages onto the LRU was merely an extremely
complicated way of making the VFS cache scanning rate porportional to the
pagecache scanning rate.  So we ended up doing just that, without putting
the slab pages on the LRU.
