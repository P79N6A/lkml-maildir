On current git s390 has a sched_clock implementaton based on real time. That 
means we have no knowledge about steal time. E.g. if you only get 50% of your 
physial cpu from the hypervisor on 2.6.22 a single cpu bound process has 50% 
in top while on 2.6.23-rc top shows 100%, so yes, there is a regression.
