The raw device driver is obsolete because it has been superseded by the 
O_DIRECT open flag.  If you want to have dd perform unbuffered IO then 
pass the iflag=direct option for input, or oflag=direct option for 
output, and it will use O_DIRECT to bypass the buffer cache.
This of course assumes that you mean "bypass the buffer cache" when you 
say "raw io".
