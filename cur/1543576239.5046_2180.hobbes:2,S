No, in fact that is the desired behaviour. If the kernel include files
change, chances are very big that the source of the utility (or library)
needs adjustments as well. In fact if you simply recompile the old
source with the new header files you might get unwanted and unexpected
behaviour, whereas if you recompile with the older header defs you'll
simply use an advertized api that might not be the latest but works
