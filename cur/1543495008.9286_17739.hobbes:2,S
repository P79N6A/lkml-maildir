I really don't think the linear search is a big issue. You had at _max_ 90
task running at the same time. I think the big issue is to avoid the not
needed schedule(). If you avoid them you drop from 40000 schedule/sec to
3000 schedule/sec...
And using an heap would impact all cases where the machine is not
overloaded but it has only 5/6 tasks running all the time.
BTW, Is your http client freely available?
