  Hi, all. I've just released version 1.2.3 of my devfsd (devfs
daemon) at: 
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/
This works with devfs-patch-v112.
The main change is that devfsd now supports protocol version 4, which
includes inode lookup, create and change events. This allows cool new
things to be done:
- lookups:
  . you can authenticate module autoload events, allowing only
    specific users to load particular modules
  . you can construct arbitrary namespaces if you don't like the
    default one
  . you can automagically create pipes, sockets and symlinks for
    devices which aren't there (transparent device simulation)
- creates&changes:
  . you can use devfsd to maintain a persistence database. This
    database can even be made to look like a regular /dev.
In addition, the config file format has changed to separate action
types and events. Now any action can be bound to any event.
				Regards,
					Richard....
