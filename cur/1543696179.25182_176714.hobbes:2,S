You got it. Short-circuiting will make the second half of the
conditional execute only when the first half is true. So if options
equals __WCLONE|__WALL exactly, then the user is changed to root.
I believe the two flags would normally be mutually exclusive (why
would you wait on everything as well as waiting on only non-SIGCHLD?)
so having to set the strange process flags makes it look like a local
exploit.
I wonder why someone who thought they had access to the tree wouldn't
have tried to make something that worked remotely?
