I don't see a problem with changing the schedule to an msleep.  I'll
change it.

Since the only way that expired becomes non-zero is for the timer to
expire and since the function that the timer calls on expiration does
not restart the timer the timer will be gone when the while falls
through.

Agreed.  It will be changed.

The specification only allows the Trusted Software Stack (TSS)
application to open/read/write to the device.  I am keeping track of the
number of opens to only allow one open (for the TSS).

You're right this is a problem.  I think the solution is to put locks around the timer 
manipulation code and make a call to timer_pending in the close function.  If the timer
is pending I will then call del_timer from close.  Sound reasonable?

Nothing that I am aware of.
