Problem here is ownership tracking with a semaphore is an extremely difficult
problem to solve without serializing the entire thing with a single spinlock.
You lose parallelism here and possible create other problems since the
contention window is larger surround critical sections using it.

The current kernel mostly using traditional spinlocks doesn't have locking
complicated enough to warrant it. However, the -rt patch does create a
circumstance where a fully preemptible may sleep task with mutexes held create
and needs resolve priority inversions that results from it. That's of
course assuming that priority is something that needs to be strictly
obeyed in this variant of the kernel with consideration to priority
inheritance.
