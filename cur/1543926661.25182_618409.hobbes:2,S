Hm, do you recall what processors that might affect?  As far as I know,
current processors will ignore non-present top-level entries.  Anyway,
we can point them not present to empty_zero_page, so testing the present
bit will still be sufficient to tell if we need to allocate a new pmd,
but if the hardware decides to follow the page reference there's no harm
done.  (Hm, unless the hardware decides it wants to set A or D bits in
empty_zero_page for some reason...)

That just means we need to reload cr3 after populating the pgd with a
new pmd, right?
