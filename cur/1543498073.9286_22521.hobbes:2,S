this is rather unsafe - you might end up hiding a 'real' NMI. This was one
of the reasons why i never pressed for getting my NMI patches into the
kernel, it's not a clean hw interface in it's current form. Why did you
have to add the NMI stuff and mix it up with your fixes - the NMI TLB
flushing things is definitely unnecessery now and a rather dubious
optimization, especially in the 2.2 cycle. Also, as i explained earlier,
the NMI thing is an optimization and it only hides bugs, does not solve it
