Yes: don't worry. That's Unix.

There's a very simple means to "solve" that scenario, if you are the
one in a million people who happens to have such a setup, _and_ want
to recompile your kernel from scratch: create a loop mount file on the
FAT partition, create an ext2fs there, mount that, and compile on it.
Problem solved.
