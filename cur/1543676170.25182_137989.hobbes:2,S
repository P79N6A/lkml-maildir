I would be concerned as to what applications rely in the tty write being done
completely before returning. OTOH I can't see any reason we can't drop the
atomicity part without dropping the 1Mb write will eventually write 1Mbyte
property. That would not seem to be a problem unless POSIX says otherwise ?
