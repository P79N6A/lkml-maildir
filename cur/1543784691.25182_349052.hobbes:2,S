Weird, why are the rules to build *.o files in scripts/Makefile.build?

So why is this benefit only available via Kbuild?
If the toplevel Makefile is to crowded, why don't you move things into 
scripts/?

If we continue in this direction, it would be even more natural to merge 
the Makefile with Kconfig, so I don't see the point in introducing Kbuild 
in first place, if we later remove it again anyway.
