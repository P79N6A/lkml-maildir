your bios needs to support this. if it does not, no chance.
use grub:
	mkdir /boot/grub
	cp /usr/share/grub/i386-pc/stage{1,2} /boot/grub
	cp /usr/share/doc/grub/menu.lst /boot/grub
	vi /boot/grub/menu.lst:
title  Linux
root   (hd0,2)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.2.14 root=/dev/sda3 readonly hisax=3,2,10,0xd80,0,HiSax
	
	vi /boot/grub/install:
#!/bin/sh
grub --batch --no-floppy <<EOT 
root (hd0,2)
install /boot/grub/stage1 d (hd0) /boot/grub/stage2 p /boot/grub/menu.lst
quit
	
	chmod +x /boot/grub/install
	/boot/grub/floppy
done.
as an alternative you can create a small (20 mb ?) partition at
the start of your hard disk and mount it as /boot. don't forget to
move your lilo.msg to /boot. 
but i guess it's to late now, and you don't want to repartition your
harddisk.
