Hmm, fixing udev is good but users will not get the change in time. I think we
need to adjust SYSFS_DEPRECATED code to produce old results. Something like the
patch below. I wonder what Greg would think...

Driver core: fix deprectated sysfs structure for nested class devices
Nested class devices used to have 'device' symlink point to a real
(physical) device instead of a parent class device. When converting
subsystems to struct device we need to keep doing what class devices
did if CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED is Y, otherwise parts of udev break.
