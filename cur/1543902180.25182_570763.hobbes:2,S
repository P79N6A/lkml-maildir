Subject: [Resend][PATCH 2/9] ACPI: Add acpi_pm_device_sleep_state helper routine
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/17/498

From: Shaohua Li <shaohua.li@intel.com>, Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
Based on the David Brownell's patch at
http://marc.info/?l=linux-acpi&m=117873972806360&w=2
Add a helper routine returning the lowest power (highest number) ACPI device
power state that given device can be in while the system is in the sleep state
indicated by acpi_target_sleep_state .
