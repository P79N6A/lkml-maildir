Kai,
We have seen some other weirdness, but it seems related to the 
file handle engine in Linux.  When we open a handle from 
a user space context via ioctl() calls through to our kernel
level components, close this handle from another kernel 
thread, then attempt to reopen the handle from a 
differnt kernel thread, we are seeing a return code
of -21 (EISDIR) from filp_open() which is strange and 
looks like a bug.  
We are then unable to reopen the handle to /dev/st0 or /dev/st1
until the system has been rebooted.  This looks like either
a bug in Linux or something we have caused by using handles
in this manner.
Do you have any idea what might be happening here.
