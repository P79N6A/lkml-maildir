Hi,
Thanks for the responses.
But it seems I am not able to convey my problem statement correctly. My
question is when 128 (((order=5)=32)*4kbytes) contiguous pages are free, as
indicated by
.....
DMA: 106*4kB 11*8kB 5*16kB 3*32kB 2*64kB .....1*128kB..... 0*256kB 0*512kB
0*1024kB = 944kB
.....
WHY IT HAS NOT BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE APPLICATION IN FIRST PLACE.
I am also facing a somwhat similar problem. I get an OOM-KILLER for a
request of 1 page, where as the output generated by OOM-KILLER shows the
following:
.....
DMA: 0*4kB 0*8kB 0*16kB 0*32kB 2*64kB 1*128kB 1*256kB 0*512kB 0*1024kB =
512kB
.....
Is it because the min_free_kbytes in /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes is
configured to be 512? I tried to run the application by setting
/proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes to 256, but to no avail. I still got the
OOM-KILLER. Any help to aleviate the problem will be higly appreciated.
Thanks and anticipation,
~Abu.

Or, if the driver just need 32 pages that *appear* to be contiguous
without actually having to be physically contiguous, then allocate the
space with vmalloc(). Not always possible ofcourse, but if it is for
Abu's use, then perhaps that could be a solution.
