At some point something talks to the device -- in this case, it's the
SCSI layer.  Follow the interfaces in the kernel and it becomes obvious.

Orthogonal issue.  You may want a locking mechanism, but it almost
certainly should not be automatic.
Note that especially ide-scsi is a good example on how *not* to do
things.  The fact that you have to choose one of two interfaces for
different operations (I can't use a CD-writer in the default
configuration!) is insane.
