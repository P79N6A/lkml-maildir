Do you have framebuffer console compiled into your kernel? I noticed
similar behavior on my system when I had framebuffer console compiled in,
ACPI or APM (cant remember which, probably ACPI) compiled in, and bttv as
modules. System would power off when ACPI was loaded. Other times it would
do other stupid things like hang abruptly for no apparent reason.
