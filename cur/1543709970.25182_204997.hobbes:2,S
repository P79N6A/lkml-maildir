I had the same thought in my attempt at adding CRC32C to the crypto
routines, that what was needed was "digests + setkey".  But I didn't
want to add the key baggage to digests, and so created a new alg type
(CHKSUM), with pretty much identical code to digest, but with a
modified init and a new setkey interface.
So, we could modify digests now, or perhaps Jouni and I could combine
our code into a new KEYED_DIGEST type and leave digests 'pure'.
What's best?
