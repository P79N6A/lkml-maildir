Miklos Szeredi sent a patch to support multiple mountpoints/coda
devices. However, the code falls back on the default device (cfs0)
when the mountdata is incorrect. So the problem must be unrelated
to the "Bad mount data" error message.
The code to mount with the correct mountdata looks like this:
      #include <linux/coda.h>
      muxfd = open("/dev/cfs0", O_RDWR);
      struct coda_mount_data mountdata;
      mountdata.version = CODA_MOUNT_VERSION;
      mountdata.fd = muxfd
      error = mount("coda", "/coda", "coda",  MS_MGC_VAL,
		    (void *)&mountdata);
