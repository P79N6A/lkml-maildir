errstr (well, at least for strtol) are useful to find the first character that
does not make up a number (and then do whatever the user wants to, including,
continuing to parse). For example "chown 0:1337", strtol on "0:1337" should
give errstr=pointer to the ":", then check for it being a ':', then you know
the next char is the GID. :)
