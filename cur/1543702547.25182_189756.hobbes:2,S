This is an interesting approach to killing off a mountpoint.  However, 
the problem in question is not the destruction of the mountpoints, but 
rather being able to 
check_activity_of_a_hierarchy_of_mountpoints/unmount_them_together 
atomically.  This cannot be done cleanly in userspace even when given an 
interface to do the check, someone can race in before userspace 
initiates the unmounts.  The alternative is to have userspace detach the 
hierarchy of mountpoints using the '-l' option to umount(8), but then we 
may still unneccesarily unmount the filesystem will someone is in it. 
I think that both HPA and I agree that this capability is needed in 
order to support lazy mounting of multimounts properly.    The issue 
that remains is *how* to do it.

The time required to unmount something is constant if we detach the 
mountpoint using a lazy umount.
