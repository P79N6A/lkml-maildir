Subject: [BUG] pata_ali not working on a 64 bit system

Hello,
I found out that pata_ali is not working with a 64 bit kernel, while a
32 bit kernel on the same machine works fine. I'm running a very recent
kernel (872aad45, somewhere after 2.6.22-rc7).
The problem is that as soon as the module is loaded I get a screaming
interrupt:
(initramfs) modprobe pata_ali
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:05:02.1[A] -> GSI 23 (level, low) -> IRQ 23
scsi10 : pata_ali
scsi11 : pata_ali
ata11: PATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0x000000000001c880 ctl 0x000000000001c802 bmdma 0x000000000001c080 irq 23
ata12: PATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0x000000000001c480 ctl 0x000000000001c402 bmdma 0x000000000001c088 irq 23
irq 23: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)
Call Trace:

(with irqpoll it works, but probably the driver is expecting the
interrupt on another line).
The most interesting difference between 32 and 64 bit is probably this
one:
-ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:05:02.1[A] -> GSI 23 (level, low) -> IRQ 19
+ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:05:02.1[A] -> GSI 23 (level, low) -> IRQ 23
pata_ali is driving a PCI card with a PATA port and a SATA port
(sata_uli, I also tried loading this one: it doesn't scream but the SATA
port is currently not used).
I also tried pci=nocpi but the card still gets IRQ 23 when using a 64
bit kernel.
The card is this one (lspci on the 32 bit kernel).

(the SATA part - M5281 - is not used). The only difference with a 64 bit
kernel is:
-       Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 19
+       Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 23
I'm attaching:
the full lspci on 64 bit (lspci-64)
the full lspci on 32 bit (lspci-32)
full dmesg with 64 bit and irqpoll (dmesg-64)
full dmesg with 32 bit (dmesg-32)
Tell me if you need further information.
TIA,
Luca
