My understanding is that __raw_writeq() is like writeq() except not
strongly ordered and without the byte-swap on big-endian
architectures.  The __raw_writeX() variants are convenient to avoid
having to write inefficient code like writel(swab32(foo), ...) when
talking to a PCI device that wants big-endian data.  Without the raw
variant, you end up with a double swap on big-endian architectures.
sparc64 looks wrong, since __raw_writeq() seems identical to writeq(),
which seems to imply it's going to swab what is stores.
