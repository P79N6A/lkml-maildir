I think Ingo's idea of a new sched_group to contain the generic 
parameters needed for the "key" calculation, works better than adding more 
fields to existing strctures (that would, of course, host pointers to it). 
Otherwise I can already the the struct_signal being the target for other 
unrelated fields :)
