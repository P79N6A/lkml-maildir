A few things I forgot to mention in the first mail.
You can also help out by testing the development kernels - they need
testing by as many people as possible, so start testing the -rc
kernels and the daily git snapshots as well as the -mm kernels. Test
if they build with your usual configuration, test if they build with
"allnoconfig", "allyesconfig", "allmodconfig" and perhaps a random
config or two. Test if they boot OK, if they run OK for a longer time,
etc.
When you find a problem you can try to fix the issue yourself and send
a patch to both the mailinglist and the person responsible for the
code in question. If you are unable to fix the problem yourself, then
send a detailed bugreport to the list and the person responsible for
the code.  Take a look at the REPORTING-BUGS file in the kernel source
dir and the Documentation/BUG-HUNTING file.
Helping to test pre-release kernels is a valuable effort. Run a new
kernel daily :-)
