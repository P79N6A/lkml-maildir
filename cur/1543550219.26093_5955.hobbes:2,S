esssolo1 does its own FM, so the code in question is attempting to let
the driver support either external opl3 driver, or internal,
more-functional FM.
In solo1_probe, an FM interface is registered.
So, IMHO there is a bug somewhere...  Why register an FM interface in
probe, and then check_region for another FM driver in _open?  Is this
intentional or really a bug?
