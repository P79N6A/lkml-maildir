I'm on a workstation right now that needs IPv6 sometime in the next few 
months. There have been several instances where IPSec would have resolved
internal problems (it's not easily available for Solaris yet.. soon).
So why should I buy another interface every time I need to change networks?
And who said it was a workstation target? If you are going to offload TCP/IP
in a TOE, it should be where it might be useful - large (and saturated) 
compute servers, file servers. Not workstations. High bandwidth workstation
requirements are rare. And large servers will require IPSec eventually 
(personally, I think it should be required already). And if the server
requires IPSec, then the workstation will too.
So you have programmed your way into a small market. And a likely shrinking 
one at that.

So? It's called "embeded Linux". No MM, no printk (for production anyway).
Display not required.
