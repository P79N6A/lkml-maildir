Andrew, 
Although I don't run  
Redhat, your response  
tells me that, even though I 
 was feeling that it was a  
kernel problem, it could be  
a userspace issue, which I  
also suspected.  Debian  
updated their nettools  
today, so I will see if that  
helps in any way.  Thanks  
for your help.  If you think 
of anything else that might 
be an issue, please let me 
know.
