Nod.  I tested both configurations when I first got the cards, and
RAID0 and RAID10 tests with a dual Athlon and the 3ware 7800 showed Linux
soft-RAID outperforming.  I didn't save the hard-RAID results, but the following
is from a private e-mail I sent early in the summer:
RedHat 2.4.5-10smp on dual-Athlon 1.2GHz, 1GB RAM
Soft RAID0 with 4 IBM 41GB 7200RPM ATA-100 drives, chunk size 32K
ext2 w/4K blocks:
Version 1.01c       ------Sequential Output------ --Sequential Input- --Random-
                    -Per Chr- --Block-- -Rewrite- -Per Chr- --Block-- --Seeks--

I've been using hard-RAID simply because I've been playing with ext3
and LVM, and eliminating MD was one less interaction to worry about until now.
