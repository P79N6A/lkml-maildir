Really, where? In my look through the code I haven't found any mechanism 
that would result in RTS being lowered based on TTY buffers filling up, 
at least not in the 8250 case.
In this situation, though, it appears it's not the TTY buffers that are 
filling but the UART's own buffer. I would think this must be caused by 
some kind of interrupt latency that results in not draining the FIFO in 
time.
