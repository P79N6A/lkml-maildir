Yes: The slow part of my brain thinks dnotify with a new flag
DN_IGNORE_SELF, meaning don't notify for things done by the process
which is watching, would provide equivalent functionality.
That is:
Samba looks up a name:
    1. Look up cache entry in Samba's cache; fails.
    2. Try exact name; fails.
    3. Open directory.
    4. Register dnotify (DN_IGNORE_SELF | DN_CREATE | DN_RENAME | DN_DELETE).
    5. readdir(); no case-insensitive match.
    6. Stores negative cache entry in Samba.
Future lookups just succeed in Samba's cache.
Negative cache entries are simply invalidated whenever a dnotify is
received for that directory.
Samba already maintains a cache for positive entries, so this would be
very little logic to add.
In what way is your two bit proposal better?
