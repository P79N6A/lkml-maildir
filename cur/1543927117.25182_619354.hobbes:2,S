Hello List,
I am trying to get throttling to work on the following processor with 
linux 2.6.17-1.2142_FC4
with no luck.
AMD Athlon(tm) XP 1700+
cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/info
processor id:            0
acpi id:                 0
bus mastering control:   no
power management:        yes
throttling control:      yes
limit interface:         yes
The /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/* directory does not exist. I 
have modprobed
the following cpufreq* modules.
Module                  Size  Used by
cpufreq_stats           6101  0
cpufreq_powersave       2241  0
cpufreq_ondemand        7009  0
cpufreq_conservative     7265  0
What am I doing wrong?
Thanks Steve
