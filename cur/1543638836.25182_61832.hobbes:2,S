I don't know what you mean here. Clearly this is an ide problem. If you
have a statically allocated request, you _must_ serialize that yourself.

Agrh god no. So you'll spin waiting for the ioctl to complete?
From ide_raw_taskfile(), the right way to do it is:
	struct request *rq = blk_get_request(...);
This gets _everything_ right.
BTW, _glad to see you got rid of the horrible insert-and-execute stuff
in ide_raw_taskfile(). That was a layering violation.
