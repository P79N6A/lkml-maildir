        In my experience trying to share interrupts with any Tulip card
causes "issues."  I've tried it many times with many different cards
(various Kingston, Netgear and Linksys tulip cards) and every time, if
it works at all, the network latency is noticeably higher under both
Linux and Windows systems especially when transfering large streams of
data (or playing Quake :) ).  I would strongly suggest rearranging your
cards till the tulip card gets its own IRQ and see if you still have
this problem.
        On a related note, on some Kingston cards under the MS operating
systems, there is an option to set interrupt arbitration on the card.
With this set the card usually worked with shared interrupts under the
various MS operating systems but at a lower performance than when it had
its own interrupt.
