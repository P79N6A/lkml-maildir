Unfortunately, no. I removed those directories because those were the only
ones causing problems and wasn't able to reboot for a proper fsck
immediately. The rm -rf command gave no errors (to stdout or dmesg), and a
read-only fsck right after that gave no errors on the directory structure.
Sorry for the sparse details, but when you have these kind of problems on
live servers, you tend to forget the debuggability...
