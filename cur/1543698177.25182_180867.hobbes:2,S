Um, this is exactly what the code does on unload: an explicit flush.
Unfortunately, some packets are still referencing connections, so the
module *cannot* go away.  Figuring out exactly where the packets are
referenced from is the fun part.  We explicitly drop the reference in
ip_local_deliver_finish() for exactly this reason.  Perhaps there is
somewhere else we should be doing the same thing.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
