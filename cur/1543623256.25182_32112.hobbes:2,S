How will writes to tmpfs fail if we're not in an overcommit situation, but
tmpfs is full?  Unless tmpfs is changed, it looks to me like you get a SIGBUS.

We are somehow failing to communicate...

I understand this.

This too.

Yes.

Even with address overcommit management, I can fault if I touch pages when
tmpfs is full but the system is not near overcommit.

We are talking about UML kernel stacks.  If they have been allocated the way
I'm proposing with the UML __alloc_pages touching each page on the way out,
they are allocated on the host, and therefore can't fault.
This seems to me to be sufficiently careful.
One of us is missing something, who is it?
