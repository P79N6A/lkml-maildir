Sorry forgot that.Currently running 2.4.17-mjc1.
Turning off swap is apparently not an option 'cause now VMware won't run 
anymore (really a swap happy app if I ever saw one :o) I get this error 
when starting to log on to my virtual Windows XP Pro:
AIO: unexpected loss of channel ide0:0 (thread ide 0:0)
and turning swap back on it runs with no problems..*sigh*
Can I make a RAM drive and then use that for swap ??Will the patch you 
sent me work with swap turned on ??
For info my system:
Dell latitude cpx j650GT,650 MHz P3
512 MB mem
12 GB hdd
3com 3c575ct pcmcia NIC
Debian woody
kernel 2.4.17-mjc1
running in a dock station with Nvidia TNT2 32 MB graphic card
that should be all..
best regards
Christian
