Please, non-container is the environment that exist today in Linux.
Actually cpuset does provide some part of it.  But beyond that no.  
But then we are all using different terminology like beancounters,
containers, resource groups and now non-containers...

No.  I think it is appropriate to add all the accounting related fields
and object fields in the core container definition.  Controllers only
make decisions based on the information contained in container.  And it
should maintain its own data structures if needed(like what Alan said in
one of the later mails).

...and that brings to the starting question...why do you need it?
Commands like ps and top will show appropriate container number for each
task.
