Did you not see the one I posted to linux-pci yesterday?  As I say,
it's only half-done.  I wanted to get a feel for whether people like
the direction I'm taking.
Unfortunately, I can't see a web archive of linux-pci anywhere -- even
on MArc.  I can forward the patches though.

conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
