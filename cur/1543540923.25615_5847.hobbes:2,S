Even doing it that way it doesn't work for me.  I know there used to
be problems with the ToPIC controllers that Toshiba uses, are there
still problems with them?
When I try using the yenta module, I get:
neon:~$ sudo modprobe pcmcia_core
neon:~$ sudo modprobe yenta
Segmentation fault
neon:~$ sudo modprobe pci_socket
Segmentation fault
This happens wether I've got the controller in "PCIC compatible" mode,
or in "Cardbus/16 bit" mode.  
Clearly there is something else I'm doing wrong here.
Background: 
Neon is a Toshiba Satellite Pro 445CDX.  
In Cardbus mode I get this in my /proc/pci:
neon:~/tmp$ cat /proc/pci
PCI devices found:
