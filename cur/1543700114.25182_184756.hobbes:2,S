True.  I confess I didn't think too hard after narrowing down where it 
tripped up.

The first oops ocurred after 4 or 5 days. My second run crashed in the 
first night, this time in filemap.c: precheck_file_write().
This oops seemed to be at or near the first dereference of inode, before 
the f_flags test.
        /* FIXME: this is for backwards compatibility with 2.4 */
        if (!S_ISBLK(inode->i_mode) && (file->f_flags & O_APPEND))
                *ppos = pos = inode->i_size;

Is CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB all that I need?
I'm currently running 2.4.23aa1 with the inode.c patch reversions as 
Marcelo first suggested. When (IF) that crashes, or if I can get the 
test running on another SMP box I will revert to 2.4.23 + the qla2300 
driver that I need for the fibre-channel array.
