It was just supposed to be a hint to some kernel hacker who might look for
the bug in the broken fix included in pre11.
But note that you force all the pages mapped into the address space of xntpd
unswappable, which is maybe 1 megabyte of memory including pages of libc and
xntpd initialization code. It's about as much nonswappable memory as used by
the kernel... I don't see any reason to use mlockall in xntpd in normal
workstations which don't need the millisecond accuracy in their wallclock
time. But you might want to use it in your time server.
