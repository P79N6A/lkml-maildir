Subject: [PATCH 2.6] Remove spaces from MTD pci_driver.name field
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

David,
Spaces in driver names show up as spaces in the sysfs tree.
While there is no documented requirement that spaces not
exist in sysfs paths, my understanding is that they are not 
desired.
Please apply,
