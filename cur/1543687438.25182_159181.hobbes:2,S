I downloaded and applied the acpi patch patch_2.4.22-rc2_to_acpi-2.4-20030813.bz2 from:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=36832
and it did cure my spurious interrupt problem, but unfortunately, my lockups have returned.
It is strange that kernel 2.4.22-rc2 had never locked up at all (only with apic enabled).  Ran it for a good week or so with absolutely no lockup (again, only with apic enabled).  I tried my best to make it lockup and it never did, but the spurious interrupts made any device that loaded with IRQ 16 and above pretty much worthless.  If I disabled apic, my lockups returned.
So there was something about 2.4.22-rc2 (with acpi enabled), that prevented lockups (but had tons os spurious interrupts).  Something in patch_2.4.22-rc2_to_acpi-2.4-20030813.bz2 cured the spurious interrupts, but brought back the lockups.
