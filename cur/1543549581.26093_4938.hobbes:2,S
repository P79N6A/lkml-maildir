I will try to recompile some older kernels and see where it breaks, but here is the output in the 
logs when I try to mount the CD.  I enabled debugging, as well.
Found in debug logfile:
Sep 23 19:58:05 hofmann1 kernel: VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,64)
Sep 23 19:58:05 hofmann1 last message repeated 2 times
Sep 23 20:01:07 hofmann1 kernel: VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,64)
Sep 23 20:01:07 hofmann1 last message repeated 2 times
And in messages logfile:
