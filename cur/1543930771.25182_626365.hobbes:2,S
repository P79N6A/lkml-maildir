You'll need rc4-mm1's ia64-increase-datapatch-offset.patch.  That's now in
Tony's tree and should go into 2.6.24 IMO.

That works OK.

I retested 2.6.24-rc4-mm1 plus avoid-overflows-in-kernel-timec.patch and
the failure has magically gone away.
Ho hum.  I'll reconstitute the patch and will keep an eye on it.
It'd be nice to avoid the introduction of the bc dependency though.
