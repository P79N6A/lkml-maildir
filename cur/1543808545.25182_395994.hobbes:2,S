These might have different causes. The 1394 storage driver, sbp2, 
performs quite a lot of protocol handling in IRQ or soft IRQ context. I 
have been planning to move this off into process context -- not really 
because of potential latency issues but for sake of more reliable 
protocol handling. I hope I get to it RSN.
AFAICS the offending ohci1394 functions mentioned above are never called 
during normal access to an SBP-2 device. They only happen when a host 
adapter is initialized or shut down or whenever a 1394 device is plugged 
in or out (actually whenever self ID reception is completed).
