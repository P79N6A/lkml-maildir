Hello,
As I reported one or two days ago, we have real trouble with our fresh
SMP box running 2.2.10-ac4 and cpio.
The machine has a 100 Mb/s connexion. If I run :
# rsh my-smp-box 'cd /usr; find . -depth -print | cpio -oB' >/dev/null
it stops without error in the middle of the X11R6 directory (no OOPS,
nothing special in the log files on the local and the remote machine).
Now, if I issue the same command with the 2.2.5-15smp kernel from RH 6.0,
it works like a charm.
Conversely, if I run from my-smp-box (2.2.10-ac4 SMP) the following command :
# cd /usr; find . -depth -print | cpio -oB | rsh my-other-box dd of=/dev/null
it works OK.
So, something has been broken between 2.2.10-ac4 SMP and 2.2.5-15smp.
Just to add that it runs OK with a UP kernel.
More info on demand.
A+,
