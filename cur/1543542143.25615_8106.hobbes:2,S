So glibc overhead is nearly a factor of 1000. Film at 11.
Ulrich Drepper has repeatedly flamed Linus for not adding the
features needed for low-overhead POSIX threads. Linus thinks
the POSIX thread interface is broken, so he won't add the ugly
bits needed to sanely reach POSIX compliance. Ulrich has tried
to write a fully-compliant POSIX thread API, always choosing
correctness over performance.
Thanks to this fight, we get a severely bloated almost-POSIX
monster that damn near everyone hates. The lack of a unified
source tree (as found in the BSD world) only makes this worse.
There is no global tree owner to resolve this dispute.
To POSIX or not to POSIX, that is the quarrel. Too bad that it
flushes our performance down the toilet. We've seen this before
and will see it again: sysctl, floating-point initialization...
