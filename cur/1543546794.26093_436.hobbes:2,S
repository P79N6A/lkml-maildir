Opps, I didn't make myself clear.
I meant it matters less with the new allocator I'm working on, as it can
use different page orders for slabs within the same cache.  This mixing
gives a good trade off in memory/performance - my 16MB machine doesn't
fall over (at least not so often).
I keep promising to get the allocator's source out - I must try harder!
