    I tried linux hda=1247,255,63
    I have kernel 2.0.36 (Redhat 5.2 base system)
    Booting off a boot floppy .... Loads up
    and hda: QUANTUM FIREBALL EX10.2A 9789MB w/418kB Cache, CHS=1247/255/63,
    UDMA
    To my Knowledge 9789MB Not Equal 10.2Gig
    If I boot up in Windows with this drive it says it should be 10263MB
    Total,Total LBA Sectors 20033055
    Windows Finds it great (there is a 8.4? Gig limit on win95?) whcih the disk
    manager fixes?
    What is the problem? Me? Linux? The Bios? The Machine? Or can't I add up
    right?
There is no problem.
Let us first compute: 1247*255*63 = 20033055 and 20033055*512 = 10256924160.
So, the geometry you specify corresponds to the Total LBA Sectors you got
from Windows, and to 10257 MB, that is, 10.3 GB.
Why would Linux print 9789 MB?
Well, that is that silly idea that some young hackers have,
that 1 MB = 2^20 bytes. So you get 10256924160/1048576 = 9782 MiB.
Why does Linux print 9789 MB instead of 9781 MiB, and why does
Windows find 10263 MB instead of 10257 MB?
It may be a rounding effect, if CHS does not cover precisely all of
your disk. If you have a disk manager installed, that may also
take a little.
Anyway, there is no reason at all to worry about 8.4 GB limits -
there is absolutely nothing wrong in everything you show -
all differences are less than 0.1%.
Finally, this is disk setup theory for beginners - such questions
belong in comp.os.linux.setup or so - there is no kernel development
involved.
