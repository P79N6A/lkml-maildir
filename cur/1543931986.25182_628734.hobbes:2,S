so - see how difficult it is to determine, what`s the problem is ? ;)

on my 2 problematic systems, edd=skipmbr doesn`t help. only edd=off helps.

i don`t see any relation to what a user knows and what kind of system of what age he is using.

see - and THATS where our opinion probably differs very much from mine. 
i think, user`s don`t want an operating system at all.
they want that their computer just works and that they can use their apps.
us linux fans have fun with debugging things and make them work,helping others and that stuff - but others just don`t want to search for the magic token to make their computer boot. if windows just boots on that system, so should linux. if it doesn`t, they should be able to fix this without being an expert.

i don`t have a clue how likely or unlikely the problem is. i have seen that problem more than once and i know people who also can tell you about.

at least they could get help by any other linux user with average experience.
but a blinking cursor in the upper left is nothing an average linux user is being able to implicate with EDD.

ok. i think i`m making to much noise for too few lines of code, so let`s stop discussing.
but let`s wait for some more comments.
maybe some simple "probing edd" is a diplomatic solution and at least better than nothing.
