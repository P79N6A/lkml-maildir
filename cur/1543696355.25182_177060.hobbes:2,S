hi,
sorry for the late answer.
you're right, the drivers are very similar, and typically you will only
use one of them. It is of course possible to integrate them all into one
physical module, which you are free to do :) This is more or less grounded
on historic reasons far back in the development of the driver where I
introduced the different hardware access implementations to accomodate
the different implementations (and this went eventually into the kernel...).
So I'd say, go ahead and code :)
