G'day,
A customer of mine asked if RedHat 6.2 supported
the new dual xeon e7500 chip set?  After a search
which resulted in very few hits, I was wondering 
if any Linux kernel supports this? 
Also anyone know if support for it will be backported
to the 2.2 series?
Cheers,

According to Microsoft, GPL and similar licenses are "viral" 
licenses.  I guess .NET is clearly a "potentially viral 
software platform".  It would be a nice way to propagate a virus.
