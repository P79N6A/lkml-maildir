correct. I started with the hardware underneath my desk. I plan to
support more hardware once the feature is perceived as being useful.

I added ds_area to the thread_struct; someone added debugctl before.
On context-switch, the DS_AREA MSR is written if and only if the next
thread has a different ds_area entry than the prev thread and either one
has the corresponding TIF flag set.

That's what I was thinking as well.
It could also do the buffer memory management. I currently do the rlimit
check in ptrace.c and the allocation in ds.c. We should probably move
the rlimit check to ds.c, as well.
Currently, it also knows how to read and write a single BTS entry. And
it even understands the BTS format including artificial records. 
I would leave at least the knowledge how to read and write a BTS and
PEBS record inside ds.c. This way, we get all the overflow handling on
write in one place. I would definitely move the interpretation of
artificial records to its users.
It was very convenient for me to put the entire hardware abstraction
into ds.c. And it does make sense for BTS, since the general format is
identical for all processors.
This would not work for your zero-copy approach, though. And it makes
less sense for PEBS due to the different formats.
I need to think some more about this.
So far, ds.c would:
- do resource allocation of BTS and PEBS buffers per task (or
system-wide)
- do memory allocation for those buffers including rlimit checks
  - currently, I use non-pageable memory only
    there were ideas to use a pageable shadow buffer
    this would go here
- provide a PMI interrupt handler
  - users would register a callback for overflow notification
  - wrap-around, if NULL callback
- allow read and write of BTS and PEBS records
- give (read-only) access to BTS and PEBS pointers
What do you think?

markus.
