I mean this: Let's have a page with buffers. It does not care whether the
buffers are on ramdisk or not. 
CPU 0				CPU 1
is executing the code marked	is executing try_to_free_buffers on
above with ^^^^^^^:		the same page (it can be, because CPU 0
				did not lock the page)
(page->buffers &&
				page->buffers = NULL
MAJOR(page->buffers->b_dev) == 
	RAMDISK_MAJOR)) ===> Oops, NULL pointer dereference!
Maybe compiler CSE optimization will eliminate the double load of
page->buffers, but we must not rely on it. If the compiler doesn't
optimize it, it can produce random oopses.
