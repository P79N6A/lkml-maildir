But, it should be in driverfs. I'll let the devicefs people decide what to 
do ;)

Both statements are entirely true. driverfs doesn't care about device
types. The only thing the filesystem does is export the kernel data
structures and the relationships between them.
But, those devices are physical devices that the kernel is communicating 
with. Which is exactly what the device tree was designed to do.
