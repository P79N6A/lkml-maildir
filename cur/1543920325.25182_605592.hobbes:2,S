another couple of raid enhancements would be:
1. teach the system that a raid456 stripe is handled most efficiantly if 
treated as a single block of data
by this I mean that if you read one block from the stripe the system reads 
the entire stripe, so it should take this into account when doing 
read-ahead and not always throw away most of the data it read becouse it's 
outside the current readahead window (if nothing else, look at putting it 
on the tail of the LRU list instead of just forgetting it)
if you write one block of the stripe the system must read the stripe, then 
update two blocks of the stripe (the data block and the parity block), but 
if you are going to write the entire stripe out you can ignore whatever's 
there and just calculate the parity block from the data you are writing. 
this should make writing to a raid456 stripe as fast as writing to a raid0 
stripe (well, almost, you have one more block to write).
2. not directly a kernel project, create userspace tools that make 
managing raid and partitioning on linux as easy as the zfs tools
3. there is currently the ability to grow a raid56 array by adding a disk, 
but there is not the ability to take a raid5 array, add a disk and make 
the result a raid6 array.
