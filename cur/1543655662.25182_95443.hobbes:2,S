I've always stated that the whole fbdev model was flawed, it makes
basic assumptions about how a video card's memory and registers are
accessed (ie. the programming model) and many popular cards absolutely
do not fit into that model.

There is nothing to fix.  You simply must restore the video state when
the last mmap() client goes away.  The __sparc__ code does exactly that.
I think relying on an application that mmap's a card to perfectly
restore the state would work in a perfect world, one we do not live
in.  Furthermore, fixing up the state like I am suggesting makes life
much simpler for people actually working on things like X servers and
other programs directly programming the ATI chip.
