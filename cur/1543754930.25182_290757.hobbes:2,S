That's an example, as you can find at the grsecurity handbook [1]:
"The default Linux TCP/IP-stack has some properties that make it more
vulnerable to prediction-based hacks. By randomizing several items,
predicting the behaviour will be a lot more difficult."
"Randomized IP IDs hinders OS fingerprinting and will keep your machine
from being a bounce for an untraceable portscan."
