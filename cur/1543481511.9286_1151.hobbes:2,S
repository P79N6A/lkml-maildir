That is true for a simple ioctl_register.  A complex complete
ioctl_register has to handle variable-length blocks, blocks with secondary
ioctl blocks like 'struct ifreq' ioctls.  And then some ioctls take
different parameters in different drivers.

I wouldn't be surprised -- I had to dig through all these cases.
sys_mount is just gratuitous lack of a length parameter.  I handled
the filename stuff by reading to the end of the string or until
ptrace gave me errors back (end of target memory).
For my application I can get away with reading more than the actual
changes.  For some of the hairier ioctls like FDRAWCMD, I just fall
all the way back to "snapshot the entire target memory space",
which works for me.
I am curious, what is ucLinux's interest in this stuff?
