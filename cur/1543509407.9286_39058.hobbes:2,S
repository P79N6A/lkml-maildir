Hm, it looks machine-dependent, incomplete, fragile and not ported to 2.3. 
There's no way this is 2.2 material, and there's a fair amount of work before
its ready for the mainstream.  Its not obvious that the author even wants it in
the mainstream kernel (which may be a huge liability for him, since it looks
like its part of a research project).
Anyway, since its currently a fairly self-contained patch, if you really need
it for 2.2 there shouldn't be a problem with applying it yourself?
