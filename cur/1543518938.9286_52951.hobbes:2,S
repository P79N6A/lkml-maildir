(i) Don't say hda=65535,16,63 - you are telling the kernel that the drive
is smaller than it actually is. The kernel is quite able to find out how
large this drive is without your interference.
(ii) "Fdisk and Cfdisk both crash". Very unlikely, if your definition of
crash resembles mine. Anyway, if anything is wrong with *fdisk, tell the
fdisk maintainer at aeb@cwi.nl. Mention what version you use.
