Ok. I'll add a note about this to post-halloween-2.5 sometime too
when www.codemonkey.org.uk reappears again.
[sidenote: please folks, no more mails telling me about this site going away,
 it'll be back real soon, it just had to be 'upgraded' to a raq2, which didn't
 go quite as smoothly as planned.].

If it'll make apps like cdparanoia take the fast path without needing
rewriting, then that sounds like a good idea, if only to stop the
'dancing mouse' problem, though this does seem to be running away
from a bug rather than fixing it. The real question is why are the
two interacting with each other like this..
