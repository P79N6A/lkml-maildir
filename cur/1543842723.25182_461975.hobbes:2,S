I agree, there are.
But I know we explicitly tried to keep 2.4 compability in 2.6 for this
very thing.  And the fact that almost no one has reported having
problems with it, leads me to believe that the sorting order isn't as
broken as you might think.  Some machines, like the ones that Matt wrote
this patch for, need this change, but for all others, it's not really
needed.
Let's let this sit in -mm for a bit to see if anyone notices any
problems.
