Summary:  I couldn't find any further responses confirming the patch
worked, so I thought I'd report that it does work for my case which
was very similar.  See Below for details.

I have had a similar OOPS problem on an x86-64 SMP server box of mine
with a MacOS X (10.4.x) client since switching to 2.6.22.x (several
versions).  I found your messages on LKML and have applied the patch.
My symptom was the oops after approximately 1/2 to 1 day of continous
activity (iTunes playing long playlist), very reproducible.
After applying the patch in an earlier message in the thread (LKML
message archive URL "
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/20/38"
), I have had
my test running for 3 days straight now with no signs of problems.
Thanks for the great work!
