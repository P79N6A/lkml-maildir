This is exactly why we shouldn't wait on dirty pages in
the pageout path.
Of course we need to wait and we should stall before
the system gets overloaded so we don't "run into a wall",
but waiting on any random _single_ dirty page just doesn't
make sense.
Then again, that will probably still not fix the problem
that we're not keeping the disk busy so we won't get full
writeout speed and end up stalling...

Rik
