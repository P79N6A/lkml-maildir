Or RM Cobol, which is also available on Linux.  Both of these require
significant expense in new licences.

I don't know of this thing, but I have looked, on behalf of a colleague,
for tools that can compile his existing COBOL source, and found only
partial solutions (i.e. found nothing.)

Well, I'm whispering:  The cost is that something desirable but
incomplete would be removed.  While it's there it's a constant source of
irritation to those in the know.  Once removed it can be forgotten.  So
the cost is really that iBCS2 compatibility becomes less likely.  What's
the benefit in removing it?  Up to 20 cycles per exec?  That's nothing.
