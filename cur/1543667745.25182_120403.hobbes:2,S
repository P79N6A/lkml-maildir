I don't have a test config at hand right now. The patch looks better,
though you didn't remove the spinlock and replace it with some
"softer" sync. primitives.
Note that if fbcon is ever to be rmmod'ed, you need to properly
remove the timer and make sure all pending work queues have completed
(and make sure the timer won't be re-scheduled by one).
