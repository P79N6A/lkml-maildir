Once v86d is fixed up to get at the ROM directly and the driver uses MMIO
directly, I don't see a problem with unrestricting it. For the time being
however, the build is both broken, and the emulator it uses won't run on
anything but x86, so I see no reason not to add a Kconfig dependency that
reflects this until such a time where it's no longer true.
At least if there's a set of restrictions on something fairly generic,
they tend to be visible, and they also tend to get fixed up over time. We
should however not enable something generically which at the moment is
very much tied to a single platform. Later patches can remove the
dependency at such a time that that assertion no longer holds true.
