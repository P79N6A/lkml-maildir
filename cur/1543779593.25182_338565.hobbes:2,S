The problem with this is that it only papers over the bug. 
I don't mind trying to allocate at higher addresses per se: we used to
have the starting point be 0x4000 at some point, and that part is fine.  
The problem is that this also screws us if somebody has a PCI bridge with
an IO window that is at a lower address than 0x2000 - now the PCI layer 
will refuse to try to allocate within it, and you'll replace one bug by 
another.
