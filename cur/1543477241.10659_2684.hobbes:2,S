Subject: [PATCH] another knfsd reply cache bugfix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The last time I posted a patch I thought I had nailed down the problems
with the knfsd reply cache (linux/fs/nfsd/nfscache.c).  It turns out that
while that WOULD have been a bug this one gets in the way first!
The bug is this: typical usage of a 'struct svc_buf' (when adding data) is
to advance the buf member along with incrementing the len member.  For
example, here is the svc_putlong macro (from
linux/include/linux/sunrpc/svc.h)
#define svc_putlong(resp, val)  { *(resp)->buf++ = (val); (resp)->len++; }
The reply cache assumes this behavior i.e. assumes that the buf pointer
has been incremented along with all data added.  However, the routines in
linux/fs/nfsd/nfsxdr.c do not advance this pointer.  In particular, it
seems like this pointer is *not* being advanced where it could obviously
done in xdr_ressize_check.  
I assumed that this pointer must be not-incremented for a reason, so I
fixed the nfscache.c where the length calculation is done.  This works for
me, but I am unsure if a small fix to xdr_ressize_check would be more
appropriate.
Here's the diff against 2.2.0-pre7.  The solution was to ignore the buf
member (which is wrong) and look at the len member which *is* fixed up in
xdr_ressize_check.
