Release 1.3.1: Fri Apr 27 19:02:31 EDT 2001
	* kxref.py can now replace the unmaintained checkhelp.pl,  
	  checkconfig.pl, and checkincludes.pl scripts.
I'm going to stick my neck out a mile and say that I think this is a
stable release.  Doing so, of course, is in reality a clever plan which
ensures that at least three embarrassing bugs will be discovered within
the next 24 hours...
Seriously, I am now out of stuff to do on the CML2 code itself.  The
code now seems to be up to acceptable speed even on slow machines, the
UI feature requests have petered out, and this release seems to be
feature-complete with respect to everything that can be done before
the 2.5 cutover.
There is one 1.3.0 bug report pending from jeff millar, but I have 
not been able to reproduce it with 1.3.1.  I will, of course, continue
to process CML2 bug reports and rulesfile fixes.
