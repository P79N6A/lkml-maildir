Hi there,
I am trying to run Informix IDS 7.3.1 on 2.4.0 test6 and test7 and 
Informix seems to not be able to find any shared memory. I read that 
there where changes, I scaned through mailling list and news to find the 
actual changes and how to fix apps for them but could not find anything. 
What do I have to do to get Informix and Sybase (another server that we 
want to use with 2.4...) running ?
The reason for the move to 2.4.xxx test xxx is the SMP core. Our BP6 and 
Tiger 100 motherboards are much much more stable on test 6 but the DBMS 
does not want to run ....
any hints ?
