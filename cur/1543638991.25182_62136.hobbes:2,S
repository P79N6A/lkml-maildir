If you really are what you say you are, then you know that you
cannot use a MAC address that has not been assigned to your
company.
And, as a developer or "integrated systems", I do program MAC
addresses into AMD PCnet32 SEEPROMS and I do have a batch of
MAC addresses assigned to Analogic and I do known what I am
talking about.
The Linux pcnet32 driver does not have this capability so I
had to add that capability for our purposes. I would not
advise putting such a driver in the standard kernel.
