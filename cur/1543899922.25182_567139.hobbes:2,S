Wait a second,  I may have been confused before.  Do you want to know the
version of the crashing kernel when you look at a core in the crash utilty, or
do you want to know it when you are capturing the crash?  If you want the
former, then an ELF NOTE would be perfect.  If you want to know the latter, my
suggestion would be to simply modify mkdumprd to place the name of the crashing
kernel, along with its version directly into the kdump initramfs init script.
We can use makedumpfile or readelf to fish out the utsname and just embed it.
Either approach is rather easy to do I think, the former would require a kernel
modification, while the latter would require some extra scripting.

And they are.
