I would assume that it's time to stop backporting stuff to 2.4, leave it
stable and let the new cacpabilities entice people to move to 2.6.
I've had enough learning experiences with ALSA to convince me that both
the code and the documentation have a few rough edges. I'd love to just be
able to use sound hardware instead of fighting every system trying get the
options right, find and download the right tools and software versions,
recompile this and that...
