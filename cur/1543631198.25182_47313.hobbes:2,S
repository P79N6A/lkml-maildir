Yes, I was thinking of an extra step like that.
The problem is just finding a _good_ context to switch to. We can do this
two different ways:
 - actually doing a real context switch, but with a magic
   "schedule_tail()" that ends up being the rest of do_exit(). This is
   _really_ hard to get right, and implies that everything after the
   context switch has to be non-blocking (since we'd block in the "wrong"
   process context at that point.
 - my preferred solution: speculatively find _some_ process (preferably
   one that we are likely to schedule next), and use that process's
   "active_mm" to do a "switch_mm()" into (and set that to "current->mm")
   This is kind of like the lazy TLB thing, except going the other way.
The speculative thing has the problem of finding a good process, but I
would suggest something along the lines of:
 - take the first process in the run-queue on the current CPU.
 - if there is no process on th erun-queue, take our parent
The "parent" fallback is nice because (a) we're guaranteed to have a
parent and it is easily found and (b) we're going to wake our parent up
soon enough in "notify_parent()", so if the current runqueue is empty, the
parent is one of the likelier processes to end up there..
But no, I've not looked into the details. We've never stolen a mm from
anybody else before (lazy TLB _gives_ a mm to the next process, it doesn't
take it from anybody), so it might have nasty locking issues or something.
