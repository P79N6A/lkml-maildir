Subject: how to crash 2.4.4 w/SBLive

I found to my dismay that it's extremely easy to crash 2.4.4 if
it has a Live! in it. I have no way of getting at the oops, but
somebody out there probably has both this soundcard and a serial
console (or somethin').
I present it in the form of a script, but you'll probably have
no problem realizing where the problem is. The number of
"writers" never gets past 64. I guess the 65th should probably
get the same as the 2nd writer does on other cards...
As usual, let me know if this is useless without the lspci
--more-magic thing.
Cheers,
j.
