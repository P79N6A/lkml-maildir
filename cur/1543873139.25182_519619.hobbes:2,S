Ahha, now I see where the confusion comes from.
No, the reader is not a serial device, it is reader build-in x60. USB
serial device (siemens sx1) has separate problem.
Device is 
15:00.2 Generic system peripheral [0805]: Ricoh Co Ltd R5C822
SD/SDIO/MMC/MS/MSPro Host Adapter (rev 18)
root@amd:~# ls -al /dev/mmc
brw-r--r-- 1 root root 251, 0 Nov  5 16:57 /dev/mmc
...
...anything else I should try? Card is obviously detected, but I can't
access it..
Uhuh. User error, lets close the report.
mmc changed the major to 
236 mmc
... while it was something else in 2.6.20. Can we get stable device
allocation for mmc?
