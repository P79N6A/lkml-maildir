This is a poor design because the smart program must clear pE as soon
as possible. If C++ is used, main() might not even be the first code
to execute. There may be security holes in global constructors.

He is wrong. Only a buffer overflow exploit has that kind of power.
There are many other kinds of exploits that could be stopped.

I don't think this is useful. Consider this:
1. If an attacker can cause an exec(), the attacker most likely
   has gained full control via a buffer overflow.
2. If an attacker has gained full control via a buffer overflow,
   the attacker can load arbitrary code without an exec().
In other words, an attacker that can do an exec() has other ways to
get the job done. You might as well not worry about the exec.
Please, do not concern yourself with the exec() commonly found in
buffer overflow exploits. It is totally unnecessary.

Huh? Unless you enable some sort of backward compatibility hack, there
is no way that 'more' will get CAP_SETFCAP without it being listed as
something that 'more' should have. Remember that pP does not survive
across an exec() in any way. Only pI lives on.
If you enable some sort of backward compatibility hack, you get exactly
the sort of problems you ask for.

I don't want to find out if this is a corner case, do you? We'd know
it is not a corner case if we see a security alert go out.
I could think up some odd kind of DoS attack, but it would be better
if someone would post a real example. There have been attacks that
used the CPU time and file size limits.
