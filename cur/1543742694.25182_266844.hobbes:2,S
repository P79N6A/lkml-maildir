This statement is *completely* incorrect.  If I want to download GPL
software I can do so _without_ agreeing to the GPL.  I can download
it, burn a hundred private copies onto CD and smash them all with
a hammer without agreeing to the GPL(1).  However, whoever gives
me the copy _must_ agree to the GPL, or they can't give copies out
to others.  The only time I must agree to the GPL is if I want to take
one of the hundred CDs that I'm going to smash and give it to
somebody else (AKA distribution).
I can do the same thing with Starcraft.  I can burn myself a bunch of
copies and put them in a box on my desk to look at because they're
pretty, or I can smash them all to pieces to relieve anger, or I can
make a mobile out of the duplicate CDs, as long as I don't give a
_single_ copy to anybody else.
Cheers,
