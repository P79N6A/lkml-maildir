I have a problem with the fs/exec.c-search_binary_handler().
Starting with linux-2.1.23 (and up to 2.2.10) there is used a
offset of 2 within a binary to load for determinating its type.
This leads to a request for loading a module which doesn't
exist. Additionally the request is now done with a hex number
but modprobe expects decimal numbers.
(I'm using linux-2.2.10 with modutils-2.1.121)
-------------------
e.g.:
% file bin/linux/open-files 
bin/linux/open-files: Linux/i386 demand-paged executable (QMAGIC),
stripped
first 4 bytes of binary are: 0xcc, 0x00, 0x64, 0x00
Executing of this binray leads to a request of a module for
binfmt-0064 which is not found. I think the request should
be for binfmt-204 (hex 00CC) which ends in loading binfmt_aout
(modprobe -c: "alias binfmt-204 binfmt_aout").
e.g.:
% file bin/isc/nkey         
bin/isc/nkey: 80386 COFF executable
first 4 bytes of binary are: 0x4c 0x01 0x04 0x00
requested is binfmt-0004 and not as expected binfmt-332
(hex 014C) which would load iBCS (modprobe -c: 
"alias binfmt-332 iBCS").
-------------------
What was the reason for changing
  sprintf(modname, "binfmt-%hd", *(short*)(&bprm->buf));
                            ^^
to
  sprintf(modname, "binfmt-%04x", *(unsigned short *)(&bprm->buf[2]));
                            ^^^                                 ^^^
in 'fs/exec.c' or what am I doing wrong?
Thanks a lot for your help and many greetings from Cologne, Germany
