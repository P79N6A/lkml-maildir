Try enabling the NMI watchdog?  (boot with nmi_watchdog=1 on the kernel
command line) (or maybe nmi_watchdog=2).
otoh, I think NMI watchdog is always enabled on x86_64.  But the counts
aren't going up.  I forget what the story is there, apart from
lets-be-as-different-from-i386-as-we-can :(

Well.  A Key piece of information would be: did that help?
