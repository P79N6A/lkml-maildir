I don't see much point in latency testing this one yet; I have had to go
for the reset button twice in the past hour.  Web surfing and a kernel
compile kill it pretty quickly.
Lockups aside, it's not necessary to use JACK to demonstrate the
problem, playing AVIs with mplayer will skip.
As a final test I am recompiling with all debug options disabled.
