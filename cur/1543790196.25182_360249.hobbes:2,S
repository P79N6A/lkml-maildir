If the parity error is real then it would indicate a bad PCI transfer
has occurred and data corrupted in the transfer. Unfortunately because
some vendors don't use PCI parity checking much and some card vendors
don't debug their products except on that OS there are some cards that
generate spurious parity errors.
Can you send an lspci -vxx. That'll help the EDAC folk build up a view
of what needs to be blacklisted.
