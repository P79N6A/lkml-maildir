Ok, but do it step by step:
- split out useful pieces like the "patched in enable/disable flags" 
and submit them separate with an example user or two 
[I got a couple of candidates e.g. with some of the sysctls in VM or 
networking] 
- post and merge that.
- don't implement anything initially that is not needed by blktrace
- post a minimal marker patch together with the blktrace
conversion for review again on linux-kernel
- await review comments. This review would not cover the basic
need of markers, just the specific implementation.
- then potentially merge incorporate review comments
- then merge
- later add features with individual review/discussion as new users in the 
kernel are added.
