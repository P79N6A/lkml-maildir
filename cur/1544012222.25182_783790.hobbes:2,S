Yeah, I also thought of this, but I am not sure every architecture
provides primitives to modify u16 or u8 data atomically like x86 does.
But yes, I remember hearing Christoph Lameter being interested to use
unsigned char or short atomic counters for the vm allocator in the past.
The rationale was mostly that he wanted to keep a counter in a very
small data type, expecting to "poll" the counter periodically (e.g.
every X counter increment) and sum the total somewhere else.
So I think it would be the right design in the end if we want to allow
wider use of such atomic primitives for counters w/o interrupts
disabled. And I would propose we use a BUILD_BUG_ON() when the
architecture does not support an atomic operation on a specific type.
We should also document which type sizes are supported portably and
which are architecture-specific.
Or, as you say, maybe it's overdesign ? If we have to pick something
simple, just supporting "long" would be a good start.
