Note that you also need some way to keep the config symbols which are
set to "n" and commented out in the .config. Otherwise you will have
to answer a lot of questions on "make oldconfig" ("yes n | make
oldconfig" isn't an option, as this doesn't tell you which config
symbols have been added).
I have actually done my own patch to include the .config into the
kernel image some time ago. It provides the .config via
/proc/config{,.gz,.bz2} (the compression method to use is
configurable). Apart from compression, it doesn't try to do anything
special to reduce size, because I don't have any machines where it
actually matters if the kernel needs some kB more or less memory.
I didn't bother to submit the patch because of the discussions on this
topic in the past, instead I keep patching kernel sources myself
before compiling a kernel. Anyone interested can get the patch from
<
http://www.myipv6.de/patches/kconfig/>.
 Patches for new kernel
versions are uploaded occasionally, everytime I don't forget to rediff
it before applying other patches to the source tree ;-) (possibly
conflicting parts for other kernel versions are Makefiles, config.in
or Configure.help, which can all be hand-applied easily, even if you
are not a kernel hacker ;-). It works for both 2.2 and 2.4 (probably
2.5 also, didn't test yet).
Any comments on the patch are welcome ;-)
