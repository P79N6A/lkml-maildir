What do you mean, you're still running on the page tables? The CPU can
still walk the pagetables?
Because if ptep_get_and_clear_full is passed non zero in the full
argument, then that specific translation should never see another
access. I didn't know CPUs now actually resolve TLB misses as part of
speculative prefetching... does this really happen?
Do you have a pointer to where the AMD AGP GART deadlock was discussed?
Google is having some trouble finding it.

I think barrier is correct there.
The full argument means that the mm is being torn down and we are the
last thread in the mm. So these pagetables can't be visible to other CPUs,
can they?

Presumably you would redefine it for PAE also (in this case you may
actually need an smp_wmb rather than just barrier).
Unless you can explain why this is a problem and not the other pte_clear
callers.

That is what smp_wmb() means. wmb() means it should also order io memory.
Clear as mud?
