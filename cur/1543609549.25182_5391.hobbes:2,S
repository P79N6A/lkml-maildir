The affected drivers usually support different interfaces to the hardware, 
like ISA, ISAPnP, PCI, so it makes sense to build them w/o ISAPnP support. 
For instance, people may want to have built-in serial support (w/o ISAPnP 
support is fine, because they've only got a standard SuperI/O chip), but 
also modular isapnp and sound driver support, so they can demand load 
sound support if necessary.
Making ISAPnP mandatory only because you build a driver which supports
ISAPnP hardware is not an option IMO. This would force people to build
ISAPnP support who don't even have an ISA bus (only because the driver for
their PCI card also supports an ISAPnP variant).
