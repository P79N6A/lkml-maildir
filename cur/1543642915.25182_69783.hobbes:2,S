Hi there,
since v2.5.25 the devel kernel series didn't boot for me. I've tested each new 
version but without success. Saw "Loading Linux..." and after that, a blank 
screen, even sysrq was non-working, even Serial Console didn't give me _any_ 
output. I was really afraid, since I was not able to find that problem, that 
future 2.5.xx kernels won't boot for me also, BUT fortunately v2.5.34 boots 
again for me :-) and is working fine so far and I am really impressed how 
v2.5 goes ahead :-)
Therefor I decided to make a really small patch available for vanilla v2.5.34 
kernel which includes the following:
 o   2.5.34-mm1                                (Andrew Morton)
 o   aty128 Framebuffer fixes                  (Paul Mackerras)
 o   ftape damage fix                          (Mikael Pettersson)
 o   devfs fix                                 (Alexander Viro)
 o   do_syslog__down_try lock lockup           (Ingo Molnar)
 o   floppy driver init/exit fixes             (Mikael Pettersson)
 o   pcibios_fixup_irqs-static                 (Adam J. Richter)
 o   some tuning                               (me)
     - OPEN_MAX 1024
     - NR_FILE 65536
     - NR_RESERVED_FILES 128
     - TCP_KEEPALIVE_TIME (5*60*HZ)
     - int sysctl_local_port_range[2] = { 1024, 9999 };
 o   ext3 version information fix              (me)
 o   ALSA v0.9.0rc3                            (ALSA Team)
 o   XFS + KDB (2.5.33-20020908-cvs)           (SGI)
I hope you need this a bit and find it usefull as I do.
Feedback welcome :)
