OK, thanks.

Yes, this is saying that you cannot extract pageframes from a mapping of
/dev/mem.  It means that you can no longer, for example, do a direct-IO
write of a chunk of /dev/mem onto disk.  I seem to recall that this is
disallowed for other reasons anwyay.

Could be so, if someone is trying to (say) do a direct-IO write of some
sound card's DMA buffer to disk.  Which is a pretty reasonable thing to do.
Maybe it's best to not overload VM_RESERVED in this manner, but to always
mark /dev/mem as VM_IO.
