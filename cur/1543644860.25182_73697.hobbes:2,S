Hmm, qlogicisp.c isn't really usable because the disks are too slow, it
needs bounce buffering, and nobody will touch the driver (and I don't
seem to be able to figure out what's going on with it myself), and the
FC stuff seems to need out-of-tree drivers to work. I wonder if I some
help converting them to this might be found.
Thanks,
Bill
