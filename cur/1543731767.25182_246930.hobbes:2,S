I've received a howto via email on tracking down kernel oopses. I've 
followed the guide as far as I could but got stuck at the point of trying 
to find the part of asm code causing this because the 'Code' does not 
match as in the howto. I think the oops is stemming from a problem with 
the loop module but I don't know how to continue, I have not got the 
knowledge to do this.
More or less I think I've done as much as I can, I've provided as much 
information as I can about the problem. Im leaving this in the hands of 
experienced people :)
