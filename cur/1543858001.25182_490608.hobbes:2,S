I'm not very familiar with ia64 asm but it looks like its loading and
storying 8 bytes at a time for the memcpy().

OK, I'll ack the original.

	I'm shocked memcpy() introduces 8-byte stores that violate architecture
alignment rules. Is there any chance this a bug in ia64's memcpy()
implementation? I've tried to read it but since I'm not familiar with
ia64 asm I can't make out significant parts of it in
arch/ia64/lib/memcpy.S.
