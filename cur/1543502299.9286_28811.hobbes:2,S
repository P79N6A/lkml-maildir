An hour ago or so, linux-2.2.7.SuSE (as distributed
with SuSE 6.1, recompiled to eliminate modules)
died with
	"Aiee, killing interrupt handler"
The stack trace shows that it had gotten into a loop,
doing  die_if_kernel() - die() - do_exit() - schedule() -
error_code - do_page_fault() - die_if_kernel() -  etc
until stack overflow.
No logs. It is unknown what started the loop.
This is on a brand new machine. I dont have
an indication yet whether the hardware is reliable.
