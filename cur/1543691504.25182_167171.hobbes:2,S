does it look better if I change it like this:
-------------------------
Andrea - If you refuse to depend on closed software for a critical
	 part of your business, these links may be useful:
	  rsync.kernel.org::pub/scm/linux/kernel/bkcvs/linux-2.[45]/
	  
http://www.cobite.com/cvsps/
	  svn://svn.kernel.org/linux-2.[46]/trunk
-------------------------
Hope it's ok in terms of bandwidth now.
And if you don't like the text I write in my signature, I'm sorry and I
would simply suggest you to not read it. If you need a marker to cleanup
it reliably just ask me and I'll be glad to add it. IMHO the value those
services provides is too high not to advertize them as much as I
possibly can.
