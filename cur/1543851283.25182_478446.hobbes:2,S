Some background: i have put this as a default (from userspace, via
echo "platform" > disk) since at least two years (SuSE 9.3, probably
earlier) and have received one single bugreport where using "shutdown"
mode fixed a problem. I had much more reports from users that upgraded
from 9.1 and did not get the new setting about problems with "shutdown"
which were solved by changing to "platform", so from my experience,
"platform" mode is actually working better than "shutdown" mode.
Note that shutdown mode will not lead to spectacular failures, but small
annoyances like incorrectly reported AC / battery state etc.

I have never heard of a system that had problems with not-present
pm_ops->enter, but this extra safety net cannot hurt.
