So it doesn't even work with cardmgr stopped and yenta loaded?
Have you tried removing any cards plugged in to the sockets?
You could try grabbing the cbdump program from pcmcia.arm.linux.org.uk
and trying to identify whether there's any differences in the register
settings of the Cardbus bridges - between having no yenta module loaded
and having yenta loaded with the sockets suspended using:
echo 3 > /sys/class/pcmcia_socket/pcmcia_socket0/device/power/state
echo 3 > /sys/class/pcmcia_socket/pcmcia_socket1/device/power/state
(echo 0 to these files to resume the sockets.)
