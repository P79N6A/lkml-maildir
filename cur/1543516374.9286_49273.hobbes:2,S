Hello all.
Every time, near the end of the kernel compile, I get lots of messages
like these:
/tmp/ccOQyv5i.s:1213: Warning: using `%eax' instead of `%ax' due to `l'
suffix
bsetup.s: Assembler messages:
bsetup.s:1165: Warning: using `%bx' instead of `%ebx' due to `w' suffix
bsetup.s:1165: Warning: using `%bx' instead of `%ebx' due to `w' suffix
/tmp/cc1VZ3q5.s: Assembler messages:
/tmp/cc1VZ3q5.s:117: Warning: using `%eax' instead of `%ax' due to `l'
suffix
It still boots and everything 'seems' alright, but what does this
actually mean?  The latest kernel (2.3.28) does it and it's been
happening for several releases now.  Sorry, I forget when it started.
