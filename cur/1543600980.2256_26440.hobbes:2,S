Really when Rusty said "multiple cpus calling wait_for_rcu" I was thinking 
at common code calling wait_for_rcu directly (in such a case you would
have a problem too), I thought it was exported as well as call_rcu.
If you mean races with call_rcu they cannot be explained by wait_for_rcu
called by different cpus also with my approch because there's only one
keventd so only one wait_for_rcu can run at once with my current code
(obviously, only keventd will ever recall wait_for_rcu).
The problem should be elsewhere.
Also we still don't address the case of keventd being starved by RT
tasks. Maybe we should just make keventd RT, but then it would hang if
somebody reinserts itself for a long time :(. Maybe Russel's approch is
the cleaner after all, it just adds a branch in schedule fast path but
(once fixed properly with the IPI and need_resched and dropping the
unused irq checks that we don't want anyways to avoid even further
slowdown of the slow paths) then the other issues goes away as well as
the memory consumation.

Ok. As usual people should care to order the fields in cacheline
optimized manner, so for example they should care to put the rcu_head at
the very end if they want to reserve the cacheline for the "hot" fields.
This can infact save a cacheline if the data structure is very small.
It's something we cannot choose in rcu_kmalloc etc... only the user can.
