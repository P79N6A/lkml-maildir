This would make things easier to understand, but the problem is still that
you wouldn't know if sd0 or sd1 was the USB ZIP drive. And currently most
programs use the static order of devices to determine which to use (reverse
hard disks in your system and watch what linux does on bootup..)

You could also dynamically allocate major numbers if you had something like
devfs. only have hard disks, a keyboard, a mouse, a framebuffer, and 'misc'
devices, majors 0-4.
If of course, you felt like doing that :)

right. The 'checking' policy currently isn't there =(

Yes. Pretty much said that any sort of heuristic for this problem would be
fundamentally broken because there is no 'right' way of doing things, and
that he would not take any patches trying to figure out the best logic for
this - because that code would just grow and grow as cases came up that
people wanted to 'adapt it' for.
And since devices get dynamically swapped, the only 'true' way to be sure
you have the correct device on lookup is to never assume that the device
layout is going to be the same from second to second. I believe he was
seeking for something that could be considered constant for a given topology
(not usb topology as much as topology for all devices in the system, for all
busses, drivers, etc). So as long as nothing changed, things would be the
same. If something was for instance unplugged from USB, and a new device was
plugged in, the device order for everything else would stay the same, just
that one device would change (assuming USB topology was the basis of the
device ordering for the USB core driver)
So what this basically does when taken to the extreme, scarily enough, is
eliminate the major  number. We get 65,536 devices, and rely on something
external to the devices to tell us which is which. Like a daemon creating
readable links.

We would have to support a bus interface to the device and an actual
'device' interface. USB Printers are just special parallel ports, there is
no difference until you start to do things like read device status or put
the printer to sleep.

I really see the trend of hardware going toward plug-and-play. So (if I am
right) this is not a USB issue, it is a trend of all future hardware. A
'solution that works' could last us for a while, but I agree that it will
pretty much be the same flamewar everytime this is brought up... so it would
be nice if it was not just a 'hack that will last us through to 2.5.x',
because while I am sure some of you who have read my messages have figured
out I have a strong sense of sarcasm, I really really do not enjoy this at
all.
