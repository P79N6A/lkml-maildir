Nak.  We use ->mapping for page cache pages, or pages mapped into
user address space.  We use ->ptl for page table pages of user
address space.  Where is it that you expect a data page to be
used as a page table page at the same time?
This 2.6.16 change was precisely to share that part of the struct
page between mapping and ptl, so as to bring struct page back down
to its 2.6.14 size on the non-DEBUG_SPINLOCK configurations.
