Subject: 2.5.48-bk2 and -mm1 can't mount root?

Is this a known problem of some sort?
I have tried 2.5.48-bk2 on one
machine, and 2.5.48-mm1 on two.
The result is always the same:
disks and partitions are detected, but the
root mount fails with a panic message that
it couldn't mount root on major:minor.
The major:minor numbers are correct,
a ide drive for the first machine and a
scsi raid-1 device on the other.
Both machines runs 2.5.47 with no other
problems than ALSA silence.
I use gcc 2.95.4 (debian) on both machines,
and both uses devfs & preempt. One is
UP and the other SMP
