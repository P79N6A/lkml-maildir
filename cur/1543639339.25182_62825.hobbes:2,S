That's only when you fork from a process with a minimal amount of VM mapped, 
such as bash, which has 3 page tables allocated to it, all of which get 
unshared.  The situation is entirely different if you fork from a process 
that has malloced more than a few meg, or beaten on a large mmap.  Page table 
sharing turns in a significant win there.

It's currently expressed as a config option.  As it's purely an optimization 
there's no reason to do otherwise.  Disabling it per-arch should be trivial.

That seems likely ;-)
