One of the things that most annoys me about udev is that I still need
a minimal static dev in order for the system to boot.  Could something
like this be used as follows?
1)  Boot kernel with an arg "automount_ndevfs", which automounts on /dev
2)  Init scripts use console, ttyX, hda, sda, etc from ndevfs
3)  Init script for udev does:
# mount -t tmpfs udev /.dev
# udevstart /.dev
# mount --move /.dev /dev
# mount -t ndevfs ndevfs /dev/.kerndev
4)  Normal userspace apps use /dev
5)  When udev is stopped, it can just umount /dev/.kerndev, then umount
/dev, then the basic stuff should still work.
Ideally ndevfs should support basic subdirectories and symlinks, so that
a simple /dev/pts could be mounted over top of it without any hassle.
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett

software stuff and not get a real job. Charles Shultz had the best  
answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do it
because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't.  
That's why
I draw cartoons. It's my life."
