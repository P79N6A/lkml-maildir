SMP is no different from UP as far as graphics hardware is concerned.
The PCI/AGP bus will serialize accesses and the card will not notice
any difference between SMP and two processes task switching in UP.

Then don't do it.

No.
Having several fbdev apps sleeping on several incative VTs while
you are running another on the current VT must be possible, otherwise
you are removing important functionality.
It's most probably too late to redesign fbdev for safe user access
for 2.4, but in any case only allowing one open() is not the right
way for 2.4 or any future kernel version. If you want some safety
for 2.4, then only allow root processes to map the MMIO region.
