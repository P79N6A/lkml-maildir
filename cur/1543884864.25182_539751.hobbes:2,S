Would annotating the Hugepages_* field with name of cpuset help?  I
orginally thought that since cpuset's mems are hirearchical in memory
assignment, it is fairly straightforward to understand what's going
on: parent cpuset stats include its and all of its children.  For
example, if root cpuset has two sub job1 and job2 cpusets, each has 20
and 30 htlb pages, when query at each level, we have:
[root@box]# echo $$ > /dev/cpuset/tasks
[root@box]# grep HugePages_Total /proc/meminfo
HugePages_Total:    50
[root@box]# echo $$ > /dev/cpuset/job1/tasks
[root@box]# grep HugePages_Total /proc/meminfo
HugePages_Total:    20
[root@box]# echo $$ > /dev/cpuset/job2/tasks
[root@box]# grep HugePages_Total /proc/meminfo
HugePages_Total:    30
If this is odd, do you have any suggestions for alternative?
