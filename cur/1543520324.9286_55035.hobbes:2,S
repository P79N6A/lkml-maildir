Hi,
I noticed that raw sockets created with
	socket(PF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(ETH_P_IP))
and a later
	setsockopt(... ADD_MEMBERSHIP (PROMISC)...)
do not receive outgoing packets.  Just changing the
protocol to ETH_P_ALL (or a later bind with that proto)
will get all packets.  Is this intentional?  (I don't think
so *g*)  Any idea for a quick fix?
Ciao, ET.
PS:  Btw, if anyone got Oopses with the defxx.c fddi driver
he should undefine the DYNAMIC_BUFFERS symbol.  There's an
unchecked dev_alloc_skb in the driver that tries to get
a large buffer (fddi pkt size + a little bit, 4.5k) and
that one fails occasionally.
PPS: the PACKET_RX_RING is really great!!!
