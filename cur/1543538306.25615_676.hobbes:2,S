I an using RedHat Linux 6.0
When using Gnome desktop, I cannot use the log out from the main menu . I have to use terminal mode
to reboot.
I also don't understand why that my session manager is inactive in the control center. I suspect
there may be some package that I have not installed. Anybody knows how to get the log out and
session manager active again or what package is influencing this? Please advice.
Thanks.
