Well, both "'till" and "'til" are broken. It is either "till" or "until".
The fix was valid.
"until" and "till" are _not_ the same word, "till" is not an abbreviation
of "until", it's actually quite the opposite. I suspect this is obivous
for most non-english germanic speakers I will guess. "Until" is in
norwegian "inntil", meaning "in to", and "till" is just english spelling
of our "til" (meaning "to").
The spelling of "until" should ofcourse be "in till".  :)
I belive the Scots also say "unto".
