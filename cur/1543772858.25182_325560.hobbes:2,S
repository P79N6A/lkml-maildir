I agree. You're one of the few folks from IBM and other large companies
to understand this. There's a real lack of technical leadership in this
community and it is a fear of change in general as well as to this patch
because of what seem to be an inability to think through various problems
like this and be comfortable with it. That's why I went to FreeBSD for a
while since the Linux VM system back in the day was doing nothing be
thrashing. Even in 2005 it's still got problems relative to the BSDs for
load handling it seems and this why I still track projects like DragonFly
BSD since they are much more friendly to heavy design changes unlike Linux.

In my case, I was already subverted by Linux and other open source projects.
I just happen to get hired by an RTOS vendor to continue this work in some
way.

This implications of this patch are huge. It's transparent and will ultimately
change the userspace land scape for just about everything despite the paranoia
and disinformation spread by various arch-conservatives in this community.
