I did not even consider that meaning of built-in, but that does seem more 
descriptive.

To avoid confusion between 'built-in' drivers and 'on-board'
controllers, consistently use the term 'on-board' for controllers.
Minor line-wrapping improvements in descriptions for config options.

Spelling for on-board seems to be rather inconsistent. All of "on board",
"on-board" and onboard currently occur. I've chosen "on-board" as that seems 
most correct to me.
