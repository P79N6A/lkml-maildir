Dear Folks,
With a single 2.26GHz P4, an Asus P4B533-E motherboard, is it possible
to reliably use two additional PCI IDE cards (using SI680), one hard
disk per channel, and have the thing work reliably?
Could this be the cause of my lockups?  I have a total of 6 ATA133
hard disks, one DVD player all connected to the two IDE channels on
the motherboard, and one disk to each of the channels of the SI680
cards.
Some people have told me that this is just asking for trouble, and
that I should buy a 3ware card instead.
I am also using software RAID1, RAID5 with LVM on top.
My machine locks solid at unpredictable intervals with no response
from keyboard lights, no Alt-Sysrq-x response, etc, with a wide
variety of 2.4.x kernels, including 2.4.22.
