I do not think that they all need to shared a single lock.  And we don't
have your code, but spin_lock_bh may be an incorrect choice too.
Note that when topology changes, that is an operation which might take
more than a few milliseconds.  Therefore, your solution should do
something OTHER than spinning on a lock, while topology is changing.
dev->open and dev->do_ioctl are called with rtnl_lock already held.  You
can sleep in them.  Use that to your advantage...
