drivers/char/tty_io.c schedules flush_to_ldisc work. This
work can potentially reschedule itself, making call to
flush_scheduled_work() at the end of release_dev()
useless :-( 
Unfortunately I have no idea what is that code trying to do -
we already did tty->ldisc.close() and replaced
tty->ldisc with something else when we call flush_scheduled_work(),
so I doubt that work we are waiting for can do anything
useful even if TTY_DONT_FLIP is not set...
