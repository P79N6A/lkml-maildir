Here it is, on a Freebox v1 (the Freebox distributed now is version 3,
but version 1 was still distributed less than one year ago (i.e. under
the 3 years limit in the GPL)).

Initiating SYN Stealth Scan against XX.XX.XX.254 [1660 ports] at 20:23
Discovered open port 22/tcp on XX.XX.XX.254
Discovered open port 199/tcp on XX.XX.XX.254
The SYN Stealth Scan took 5.12s to scan 1660 total ports.
For OSScan assuming that port 22 is open and port 1 is closed and
neither are firewalled
Host XX.XX.XX.254 appears to be up ... good.
Interesting ports on XX.XX.XX.254:
(The 1658 ports scanned but not shown below are in state: closed)
PORT    STATE SERVICE
22/tcp  open  ssh
199/tcp open  smux

If I remember correctly my contract, after 36 months, I become the owner
of the freebox. The argument about renting does not seem to hold,
anyway.
I will contact Free to ask for more information.
Best,
     /er.
