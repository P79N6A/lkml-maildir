Hi,
I've compiled about 10 various kernels so I have some additional 
information. IDE patches upto ide.2.2.16 (dd. 2000-06-15) solve the 
problem with ht6560a, but newer patches starting ide.2.2.16.20000619 
not. 
So Andre, what may be the cause? What was so special on your patches 
till 15-Jun-2000? I did a diff between these versions and it has 
almost 200KB, so I'm not able to guess what difference is fatal.
