This sounds like when you downloaded the 5.1.24 patch you used netscape and
you didn't shift-click on the link in order to force a regular download and
instead it displayed the patch in a browser window and you then had to save
the patch to disk.  This will sometimes result in corrupted patches.  If
that's not the case then I'm not sure what is.  I'm able to take a clean
2.2.14 kernel here and apply the 5.1.22, 5.1.23, 5.1.24, and 5.1.25 patches to
it in that order without any rejects.

I should note that even though I have a 5.1.25 patch on my web site now, it's
not the official patch and can change at any time (it did just about 5 minutes
ago as a matter of fact).  When I announce it and ship it to Linus/Alan then
it won't change any more, but right now I needed an easy place to distribute
it while doing some testing with people that have specific problems.
