Sorry, stupid question for the 04 one. What my brain wanted to say: The 
patches 01 and 02 seem to aim at dirtying the super block less often. If 
there is serious writing activity, will this lead to fewer but longer 
commits? The problem with our current (kinda stupid) software is that 
lower write() latency is more important than a few percent more 
throughput.
Ciao,
