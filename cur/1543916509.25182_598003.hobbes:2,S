Hi all,
I want to check performance difference by using realtime preemption patch :
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/
Please let me know from where I can download samples to test realtime
preemption performance difference.
Can someone please share performance numbers for your hardware:-
1. Interrupt latency
2. Task switching time
3. hard-realtime scheduling latency
Thank you,
Jaswinder Singh.
