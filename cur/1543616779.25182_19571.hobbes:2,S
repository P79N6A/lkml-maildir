Sorry, but I'm still waiting for the proof that preempting deadlocks the
system.
If n running processes have together m time slices, after m ticks every
process will have run it's full share of the time, no matter how often
you schedule. (I assume here a correct time accounting, which is
currently not the case, but that's a different (and not new) problem.)
So even the low priority process will have the same time as before to do
it's job, it will be delayed, but it will not be delayed forever, so I'm
failing to see how preempting Linux should deadlock.
bye, Roman
