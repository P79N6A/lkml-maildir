That all depends on the terms of the NDA.
To me, if an NDA expires, it can mean 2 things:
1) All information covered by the NDA has to be returned, and any 
information that cannot be returned, (I.E. Remembered in someone's 
brain.) must be kept secret forever, or until the information is made 
public by someone else.
2) The information covered in the NDA is no longer secret, and can be 
discosed to the public.
