so in your opinion Nick's mentioning of STREAMS is an insult too? I 
certainly do not understand Nick's example as an insult. Is STREAMS now 
a dirty word to you that no-one is allowed to use as an example in 
kernel maintanance discussions?
Let me recap how I mentioned STREAMS for the first time: it was simply 
the best example i could think of when you asked the following question:

(see <20060915231419.GA24731@elte.hu> for the full context. Tellingly, 
that point of mine you have left unreplied too.)
btw., you still have not retracted or corrected your false suggestion 
that "concessions" or a "compromise" were possible and you did not 
retract or correct your false accusation that i "dont want to make 
them":

while, as i explained it before, such a concession simply does not exist 
- so i am not in the position to "make such a concession". There are 
only two choices in essence: either we accept a generic static tracer, 
or we reject it.
