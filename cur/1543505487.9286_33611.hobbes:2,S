Yep. I took the same attitude with him as I did with barclays bank and
threatened to sue him/her for discrimating between OSs in such a manner, I
mean winblows is crap everyone knows, and OK, so MacOS is *better*, but since
that microshark "loan" of millions to Apple, I will always view Apple and
microshaft as being too close so I find this kind of discrimination very bad
for everyone. BARCLAYS HAD THE NERVE to claim that
LINUX IS ***LESS*** SECURE THAN WINDOWS 95/98/NT - what an utter sh*tload of
crap. I mean, it made me laugh and I've still gotta decide if I'm gonna pursue
the case with Barclays.... (I *used* to like them too).
