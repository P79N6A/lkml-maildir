This looks an awful lot like the PowerPC architecture.
In an SMP system, one would most likely mark pages as
requiring coherency. This means that stores to a memory
location from multiple processors will give sane results.
Ordering is undefined when multiple memory locations are
involved.
There is a memory barrier instruction called "eieio".
This is commonly used for IO, but is also useful for RAM.
Two separate sets of memory operations are simultaneously
and independently affected by eieio:
-- set one, generally memory-mapped IO space --
loads to uncached + guarded memory
stores to uncached + guarded memory
stores to write-through-required memory
-- set two, generally RAM on an SMP box --
stores to cached + write-back + coherent
"The eieio instruction is intended for use in managing shared data
structures ... the shared data structure and the lock that protects
it must be altered only by stores that are in the same set"
                             -- from the 32-bit ppc arch book
