I had a clean 2.6.21-rc7 that I forgot to change the default sched on take down my main server last 
night. Another oops of the same variety. Unfortunately only a digital photo to go by though.
I've removed Neil's patch, applied yours and fired it up on my 4 drive test box (the one that was 
causing the trouble before). I've finally scrounged another machine for a serial logger and I'll 
beat it until it breaks. Perhaps if I can get this to reliably trigger again we can track it down.
