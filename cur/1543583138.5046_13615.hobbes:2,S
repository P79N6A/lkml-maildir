OK (Manfred is being quoted here, to be clear).
I'm still talking with Alexey about how to fix this, I might just
prefer killing this fallback mechanism of skb_alloc_send_skb then
make AF_UNIX act just like everyone else.
This was always just a performance hack, and one which makes less
and less sense as time goes on.
