Its not a "potential" security hole. 
If KNI instructions don't fault in an environment where they are marked
available but not saved then its an actual hole. If KNI instructions do
fault its not a security hole
In case a) Ingo's code needs to panic at boot on a Xeon/PIII if its
not using FXSAVE (clearly not acceptable) or dynamic link
In case b) Ingo's patch is fine.
Ingo - I've yet to see any actual PIII docs - what _actually_ occurs in
this situation
