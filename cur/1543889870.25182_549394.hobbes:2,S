... which means that original question ("what type should x have...")
gets the answer "scalars, arrays or functions".  The last two variants
give you constant 1, though (arrays and functions decay to pointers in
such context and that pointer is not going to be different from null
pointer of the same type; thus you get !!x => !0 => 1).
