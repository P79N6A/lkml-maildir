Indeed, poll/select are very nice APIs and you definitely want to use them
if your apps does not need certain requirements. If N/M approaches 1, poll
scales exactly (alomst) like epoll. But poll does not born to scale on
huge number of fds, and this is recognized by ages. Yesterday I pulled out
a Mogul paper where (a long time ago) he talks about poll limits and he
also talks about three ideal APIs to deal with networking load :
declare_interest == epoll_ctl(EPOLL_CTL_ADD)
revoke_interest == epoll_ctl(EPOLL_CTL_DEL)
dequeue_next_events == epoll_wait()
This a long time before epoll :)
