Ok.
I would suggest one of the followings:
1. If we can't identify those machine, I would recommend to drop that patch,
since probably the BIOS is taking care of it nowadays.
2. If we believe we can't do (1) above, lets have it rest only the first
controller it is being called for.  This will make any of the other
controllers usable if their ports are set right.
Any comments?

Yes.

Because 2.4 was never used on the affected machines, where this fixup
was needed - those machines sere putting nonsense into the BARs. I don't
recall exactly what model they were, though I remember they were one of
the first machines with ICH MMIO support.
