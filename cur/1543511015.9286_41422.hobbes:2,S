They are, mostly, but not entirely.  This becomes an issue if you have an
apple laptop with a pcmcia modem card that looks like a 16550 (as I do) or
if you want to build a kernel which will work both on machines with 8530s
and on machines with 16550s.  And there are in fact a few machines with
both 8530s and 16550s.  I have one, and at the moment I just don't use the
8530s.

I don't know what non-tty driver would be grabbing that major.
