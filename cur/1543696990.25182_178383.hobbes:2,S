If arguments of ->open() were not enough to find your data, how the hell would
current code manage to find it?
You've got inode; you've got (if that's on procfs) proc_dir_entry - from
inode; you've got dentry (from struct file *).  If that's not enough to
find your data, what is?
Which files do you have in mind?
