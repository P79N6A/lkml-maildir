hi
I am interested in implementing source-level debugging features for kdb.
I know that kgdb already does that, but kgdb is very inconvenient to use
compared to kdb as it requires two systems. Adding source level
debugging to kdb would allow me to understand the kernel source code
much better, since i would be able to trace thru the code and see it in
action.
has any such work already been done before? any tips on how this can be
implemented??
Thanks in Advance
Regards
