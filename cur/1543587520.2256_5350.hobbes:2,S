	Even in that case, you want to run the child first because
it may block on I/O when it does the exec or the new program starts
running, and you are likely to be able to use that time while the
child is waiting on I/O for the parent to run (typically just to
record the process in its internal data structures and then call
wait()).  Basically, you want to kick off some new I/O before running
something that can run while that I/O is pending.
	Of course, in the vfork case, this change is probably only a
very small win.  The real advantage is with regular fork() followed
by an exec, which happens quite a lot.  For example, I do not see
vfork anywhere in the bash sources.
