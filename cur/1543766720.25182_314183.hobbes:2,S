This doesn't help.  Consider what happens when two devices share an IRQ
line.  Suppose device B is generating interrupt requests when the driver
for device A is probed.  The driver registers its handler, which causes
the IRQ line to be unmasked.  Then a multitude of IRQs arrive from B, none
of which can be handled by A's driver.  So the kernel shuts the IRQ line
down permanently...
