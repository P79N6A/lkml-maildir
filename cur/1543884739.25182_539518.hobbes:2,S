I'm not a big fan of the s/INTEL_/I_/ change to be honest.
I'd prefer we didn't change this, as a) there may be additional
patches in flight which touch intel-agp.c depending on those defines,
b) it'll make future changes to intel-agp.c harder to backport to
-stable releases, and c) it doesn't really add any value.

harmless, but ok.

I'd drop this completely. The majority of users will never see it anyway,
and the boot process already spews so much stuff that it'll just get lost
in the noise.
