Like a few other folks, I have been getting warning messages from
the paranoia checks in drivers/char/tty_io.c in kernel 2.5.49:
Warning: null TTY for (88:03) in tty_fasync
Warning: null TTY for (88:04) in tty_fasync
Warning: null TTY for (88:00) in tty_fasync
Warning: null TTY for (88:03) in tty_fasync
Warning: null TTY for (88:06) in tty_fasync
Warning: null TTY for (88:06) in tty_fasync
I am running Debian Sid, the kernel was built with the gcc 2.95.x that
came as standard. I am able to (re)produce the warnings using screen(1)
3.09.13 by creating (C-a C-c) a window/shell, and then logging out (C-d).
Destroying the screen window with C-a :kill doesn't cause the warning
messages. Maybe it has something to do with the shell still holding it.
I can provide more information if needed. Please Cc: me any requests
for information or replies, as I'm not subscribed to LKML.
thanks,
