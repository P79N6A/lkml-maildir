Hi,
Is this the right mailing list for Infiniband, RDMA-iWarp related Linux kernel issues?
Assuming yes,
1. Let's say there are two iWarp adapters, they both are in different subnet.
Their respective net_device is configured in different subnet.
(say one from Chelsio and other from Neteffect vendor)
How does connection manager module figures how that a connect() call should be diverted to which ib_device?
Regards,
