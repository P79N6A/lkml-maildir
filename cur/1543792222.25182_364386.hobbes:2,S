Hi all,
I've got a problem with SUSE LINUX Enterprise Server 9 (i586) patchlevel 2,
Linux 2.6.5-7.191-smp.
When I do the following (from bash):
trap 'echo bla' 14 ; /bin/kill -14 $$
nothing happens, utilities like iostat and netperf (and likely other utilities)
won't work due to this problem.
I've checked the glibc installation (rpm -V) and it's unchanged, bash and all
it's dependencies are also fine.
The kernel is unchanged from the SuSE LINUX Enterprise Server.
Could someone please help?
Thanks in advance,
Dick
