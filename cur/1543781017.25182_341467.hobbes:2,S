My patch has been around for quite a while, and no-one else has complained,
not even you before this point. Plus, you don't seem to be complaining about
PageSwapCache... nor even PageLocked.
I'm just requesting that you base your stuff on my patch that's already in
-mm. The names in there are already in use, though not currently in the -mm
patch (the patches that use it have been temporarily dropped).

Just because you don't like it doesn't make it a bad idea or wrong.
Please then suggest an alternative way of doing this. Do you understand the
problem I'm trying to solve?

There may be plenty of inelegance in the kernel, but this comment isn't very
helpful. I've looked at an awful lot of code and cogitated much and tried
different ways of doing things. Currently this is the best I've come up with.
