What I understood from the gcc mailing list is that a patch has been
applied to the gcc sources that solves the issue with speculative
stores that was already discussed here on the LKML
(
http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2007-10/msg00554.html
).
But the issue I am referring to is a different issue: namely that a
compiler optimization called register promotion can introduce data
races. Hans J. Boehm has a clear explanation of this -- see also
paragraph 4.3 in
http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2004/HPL-2004-209.pdf
 or
