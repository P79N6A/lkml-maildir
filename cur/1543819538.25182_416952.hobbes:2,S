As for the network namespaces.  It actually isn't that hard, but
it is tedious and big.   Once we get ipc and uts it will probably be
the namespace to merge.  I have the basic code sitting out on a branch.
Getting the little things like sysctl, sorted out are the primary
problems.  At the same time we don't have to solve the problems for
the network namespace now.  Just don't expect it way of in the
indefinite future, either.
