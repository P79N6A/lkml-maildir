Not any more. I fixed that one (very different issue, btw: it's not 
actually doign writeout, it actually wanted to cancel IO on truncated 
buffers.
However, it's certainly possible that my fix hasn't mirrored out yet, I 
pushed it just a couple of hours ago. So if you want to test it, here are 
the two commits in question..
(The "cancel_dirty_page()" cleanup is needed not just to do reiserfs as a 
module, it's also to make it more robust against reiserfs possibly feeding 
that function with strange pages, and to match the other related functions 
in the accounting functions).
Len Brown tested the reiserfs changes, and claims that it was all good, 
but if somebody wants to run fsx-linux or some other filesystem stress 
testing tool that actually tests shared mmap (and truncate), that would be 
really appreciated.

    Clean up and export cancel_dirty_page() to modules
    Make cancel_dirty_page() act more like all the other dirty and writeback
    accounting functions: test for "mapping" being NULL, and do the
    NR_FILE_DIRY accounting purely based on mapping_cap_account_dirty()).
    Also, add it to the exports, so that modular filesystems can use it.

    Fix reiserfs after "test_clear_page_dirty()" removal
    Thanks to Len Brown for testing this fix, since while they have in the
    past, none of my machines run reiserfs at the moment.
