   Oops, sorry for the noise, I hadn't noticed this yet.
   
   But nope, unfortunately it's still hanging! I've just tested with 
   2.5.69-bk15. Running into the same deadlock due to sleeping with rtnl 
   hold. This time however it seems it's triggered from sysfs side!
Stephen, you need to do the device class stuff outside of the RTNL
lock please.
At least I didn't add this bug :-)
This should fix it.
