I tried the 2.6.12-rc1-RT-V0.7.43-06 kernel again, and I still have the
serial, to do sysrq. The console is using X which locks (even all the
ctrl-alt-X functions) and the ssh session that I run the test stops
after the processes try to grab the locks. It doesn't reply to ping. But
the sysrq from the serial shows constantly:
s        test3_rt: 2269 [cf304690,  89] (not blocked)
s        test3_rt: 2270 [cf304050,  88] (not blocked)
s        test3_rt: 2271 [cef86cb0,  87] (not blocked)
s        test3_rt: 2272 [cef86670,  86] (not blocked)
R        test3_rt: 2273 [cf28a050,  85] (not blocked)
So it seems that it's in a deadlock somewhere. Since the 43-06 gets much
further, this seems to be another problem. I'm not going to look at this
problem anymore, since it doesn't show up in the lastest.
I'll run a few more tests to see if I can narrow things down on 43-06.
