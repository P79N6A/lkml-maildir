Will you accept the patches for the following:
1) races in select(), poll() and do_load_aout_binary() - with dangling
pointers to files. (2 lines for the first and second, 4 lines for the
third)
2) sys_mmap() on sparc, sparc64, yodda, yodda forgetting to grab
mmap semaphore (2-4 lines).
Those are obvious bugs and fixes are obvious too. I can send the patch 
right now.
