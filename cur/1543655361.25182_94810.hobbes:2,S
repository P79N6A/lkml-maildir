To be honest: I think this _is_ indeed a kernel development issue. We are
somehow talking of a performance lack that can be overcome by a simple patch
(call it hack) and some brain.

I guess he probably meant a _bit_ more. I may add some zeros to your 20000 to
give you a glimpse of a _standard_ load we are talking about. And you can
easily do this with the hardware you mentioned _not_ using NAT (of course ;-).
I guess it would really be a great help if someone did tests like Cons'
"overall performance" ones for network performance explicitly. Like e.g.
performance for various packet-sizes of all available protocol types, possibly
including NAT connections. We have no comparable figures at hand right now, I
guess.
