Well, the coding style you propose isn't exactly the way I do things 
(although it's pretty close).  For instance, I'm not accustomed to using 
a single tab character for indent.  Having more experience with X11 
internals than Linux, you can see where I would get my four-space indent 
habit from.  No matter.  I can easily adapt.
One thing I wanted to mention, however, is that your tongue-in-cheek 
style doesn't help you.  Coding style is something that needs to be 
taken seriously when you're setting standards.
