I believe:
It's better to have individuals listed
Front-end company/org addresses should be OK
Names without email addresses should not be OK
Other front-end addresses from MAINTAINERS:
AACRAID SCSI RAID DRIVER
P:	Adaptec OEM Raid Solutions
M:	aacraid@adaptec.com
DVB SUBSYSTEM AND DRIVERS
P:	LinuxTV.org Project
M:	linux-media@vger.kernel.org
HIGHPOINT ROCKETRAID 3xxx RAID DRIVER
P:	HighPoint Linux Team
