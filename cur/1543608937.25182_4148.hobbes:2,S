I'm using linux on an embedded system based on the 2.4.2 kernel. There
is a flash rom at physical address FFE00000 of 2 megabytes size. I have
a flash utility that uses mmap() on /dev/mem, but I can't call it with
offset 0xffe00000, size 0x00200000, I must call it with size
0x001ff000 (1 page size less than the real size). I figure this is because
the end address has wrapped around to 0 and this messes up the system.
This should work, the memory is there. But I can't access that last page.
BTW the cpu is a ppc 8260 (603e core).
