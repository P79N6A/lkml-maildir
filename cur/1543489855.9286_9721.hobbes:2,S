Erm, you mean if you have two FBs, you give each a different priority,
and if a higher priority FB wants MTRRs but a low priority FB has
already taken the two MTRRs, go ahead and grab the MTRRs anyway?
Is this really needed? It's getting more complicated (can you say
"bloat") for what appears to be a fairly uninteresting and uncommon
problem.
