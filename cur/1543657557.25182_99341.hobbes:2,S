Ohhhh, a conspiracy theory.  I like conspiracy theories.
Do tell, what exactly is the conspiracy here and who are
the parties involved ?

Copyright law is pretty explicit about the situations the GPL
applies to.  If something can be reasonably considered to be
a "derivative work" of a GPL work, the GPL applies and the
new work needs to be GPL.
However, if the new work is NOT a derivative of a GPL work,
the author of that new work gets to choose the license freely.
The border gets determined by inclusion of a copyrightable
piece of GPL code.  Really small fragments of code and simple
defines aren't copyrightable, just like you can't copyright a
single musical note, but only a song.  If nvidia's driver only
uses some simple declarations from include files and no large
(>7 lines? >10lines? what's large?) inline functions AND the
nvidia driver uses only the standard interfaces to hook into the
Linux kernel, then it's not a derivative work and nvidia gets
to choose the license.
Feel free to get upset or eat your boots at any time you want,
it's not going to change copyright law.
cheers,
Rik
