Good point.  It is unlikely this will happen in our scenario (very long-lived 
processes), but we should certainly cover that case.

That would be the simple solution.  However, it doesn't cover the case of a 
cosmic ray causing a segfault, or the OOM killer coming along, or root 
accidentally doing a kill -9 on the wrong pid, or other similar issues.
