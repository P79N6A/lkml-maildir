Well, that's why I'm writing it down before actually coding it.
Designing is also trying to make things fit together without actually
having the physical parts at hand. So I'm trying to make an interface
that CAN support multi-line blocks in the future, since it's obviously
a desired (and currently missing) feature.
But I agree; It *is* hard to see how multi-line blocks can be
implemented without actually spelling it out in code. I've tried to do
it, and failed. Until a brilliant solution comes up, I'll skip it.
