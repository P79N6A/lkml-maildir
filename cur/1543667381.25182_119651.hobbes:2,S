Hi! 
In 2.5.65-mm4, if I compile ide-cd as a module, it's 
kernel module is not loaded automatically when 
accessing the CDROM block device (/dev/hdc in my 
case). 
Compiling IDE CD as a module, then doing a mount 
/cdrom fails with "/dev/hdc is not a valid block device". 
I haven't seen any messages on the kernel ring or 
/var/log/message. So, I need to manually do modprobe 
cdrom  and modprobe ide-cd. Then, mount will work. 
As this is a pain, I have opted to compile ide-cd into the 
kernel. This doesn't happen with other modules (i.e. 
they are loaded automatically. 
Is this a bug? 
   Thanks!
