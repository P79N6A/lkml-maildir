yes, I tried it about february. I thought it to be the ideal solution, and it
performed better than the standard syslog, but not as well as syslog-ng. I
could catch about 1500 lines/s at most, and the daemon was very hungry, it ate
between 55 and 70% of the CPU, while syslog-ng eats about 25-30. So I thought
it was still a bit experimental and switched to syslog-ng.

Yes I do. I noticed the scalability problems a long time ago on my dual athlon
at home, but wasn't really concerned. At my customer's, the only SMP one is
used as a development gateway. All the others are UP (PIII/1G, P4/2.4G).
BTW, I get the same numbers with 2.4.22-pre10 / standard ip_conntrack as with
2.4.21-rc2 with tcp_window_tracking. I would have thought that
tcp_window_tracking costs a bit more, but it doesn't seem to be noticeable here.
Cheers,
Willy
