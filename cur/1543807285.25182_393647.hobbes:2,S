Well ... the comment was there, but the problem with comments
is no one reads them ;)

Agreed.  I'm still scratching my head coming up with a better way.
Hmmm ... except for the call from fork, all calls to this are from
within mm/mempolicy.c.  I could make the routine within mempolicy.c
static, and provide an exported wrapper with a name like:
	mpol_fix_fork_child_flag()
that wrapped it.  With a name like that, there seems less risk of
abusing this.
Any other suggestions?
