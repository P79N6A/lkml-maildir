Sounds reasonable - but does CFS track this?

The semantics of "idle time" for a cgroup on a shared system seem a
bit fuzzy. How would you define it?
Suppose you have two cgroups that would each want to use, say, 55% of
a CPU - technically they should each be regarded as having 45% idle
time, but if they run on a the same CPU the chances are that they will
both always have some processes on their runqueue due to contention
with the other group. So how would you measure the difference between
this and a cgroup that really is trying to use 100%?
