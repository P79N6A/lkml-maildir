I seem to be seeing 2 different problems, the first is where we are
running on the cpu we are about to remap:
running on cpu 1
mapping CPU#1's runqueue to CPU#0's runqueue.
kernel BUG in sched_map_runqueue at kernel/sched.c:1460!
ie:
BUG_ON(rq1 == rq2 || rq2->nr_running || rq_idx(cpu1) != cpu1);
                     ^^^
We should bounce ourselves off cpu2 before merging the runqueues.
