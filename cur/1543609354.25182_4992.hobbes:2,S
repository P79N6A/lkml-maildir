The relevant function is from arch/i386/kernel/pci-pc.c:
static void __init pci_fixup_via_athlon_bug(struct pci_dev *d)
{
        u8 v;
        pci_read_config_byte(d, 0x55, &v);
        if (v & 0x80) {
                printk("Trying to stomp on Athlon bug...\n");
                v &= 0x7f; /* clear bit 55.7 */
                pci_write_config_byte(d, 0x55, v);
        }
}
Note also this line from struct pci_fixup pcibios_fixups[] in the same
file:
        { PCI_FIXUP_HEADER,     PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA,      PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_8363_0,       pci_fixup_via_athlon_bug },
I believe that all you have to do is add the above line to
pcibios_fixups[] and add the above function to pci-pc.c.

You can see what pci_fixup_via_athlon_bug does: it clears bit 7 of
register 0x55 of the PCI device VIA 8363.  On a machine that has a VIA
8363 (the northbridge), I believe it will be PCI ID 0:0.0 (0th bus,
0th device, 0th subdevice).  You can check this with 'lspci -n -s
0:0.0', it should say '00:00.0 Class 0600: 1106:0305' followed by a
revision (2 for the KT133, 3 for the KT133A)
Then as root, you do 'setpci -s 0:0.0 55' to query the register, do
the computation of clearing bit 7 of the result to get a value YY, and
do 'setpci -s 0:0.0 55=YY' to set the register.  Note that both 55 and
YY are in hexadecimal.
Cheers, Wayne
