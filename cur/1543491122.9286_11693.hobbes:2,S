Hi all,
I want to use a 64 bit PCI board on my system which uses an ASUS P2L97
mother board. The PCI specs says a 64 bit PCI board should plug gracefully
into a 32 bit PCI connector, but it does not. 
The problem seems to be due to the following:
PCI 32 recommended connector:
| |--------------...-----------| |
                               >-<  1.27 [.050] mm
PCI 32 connector of the PL297 MotherBoard:
| |--------------...-----------| |
                               >-<  >= 1.80 mm  (measured +- 1mm)
If somebody could confirm that or let me know if I may have missed
something important, this will help me. 
Thanks.
Regards,
   Gérard.
