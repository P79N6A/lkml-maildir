2.6.28 works fine. 2.6.28-git1/3 only eth0 nVidia Corporation MCP55
Ethernet (rev a2) connected, using forcedeth driver, no light from the
card/switch. Checking ifconfig and route -n says the network is
correctly configured. In order to get the network back, I have to power
off/on and boot up 2.6.28. It seems to leave a permanent condition, so a
reboot to 2.6.28 does not get it working again.
Except for the additional config changes/options presented in
2.6.28-git, the kernels are configured the same, no network config
changes made.
Using openSUSE 11.2 Alpha0 x86_64 dual-core 6000+.
JUST FOR INFORMATION, but I'd be surprised if the two problems aren't
linked in some way.
=====================
The NVidia driver 180.18 works fine with 2.6.28, but fails with
2.6.28-git. The module builds and installs fine, Xorg.0.log says:-
(II) NVIDIA(0): Initialized GPU GART.
(II) NVIDIA(0): Setting mode "1280x1024"
(EE) NVIDIA(0): Failed to allocate video memory
(EE) NVIDIA(0):  *** Aborting ***
Fatal server error:
AddScreen/ScreenInit failed for driver 0
