Seems to fix the flush errors, however, I can still see the race warnings.
Worse though, at one point I stumbled upon the following:
$ df /ap
Filesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda2              1490332 -73786976294838198272   1498808 101% /ap
This was right after I hit the reset button while compiling the kernel
off a reiser4 mountpoint, went on to finish the build after reboot and
then "rm -rf"'d the whole source tree (i.e. there was nothing on the
filesystem again).
reiser4.o is 20021031 plus the rmdir leak fix from this thread plus
your patch above.

Jup, now all I get is the race warnings.
