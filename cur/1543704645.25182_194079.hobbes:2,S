2.6.2-rc2:
  root> grep PNP .config
  CONFIG_PNP=y
  CONFIG_PNP_DEBUG=y
  CONFIG_ISAPNP=y
  CONFIG_PNPBIOS=y
  # CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPNP is not set
  CONFIG_IP_PNP=y
  CONFIG_IP_PNP_DHCP=y
  CONFIG_IP_PNP_BOOTP=y
  CONFIG_IP_PNP_RARP=y
Boots and loads parport_pc just fine, so it looks as if either it got
fixed (likely) or other evildoers are at work.
