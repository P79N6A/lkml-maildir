It only specifies that there have to be the following fields:
"sysname  Name of this implementation of the operating system.
 nodename Name of this node within an implementation-specified
          communications network. [*]
 release  Current release level of this implementation.
 version  Current version level of this release.
 machine  Name of the hardware type on which the system is running."
[*] "The inclusion of the nodename member in this structure does not
     imply that it is sufficient information for interfacing to
     communications network."
Their format is implementation defined (but should be at least
documented ;-)
