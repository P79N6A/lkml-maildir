do you compile jackd from sources? If yes then could you try the patch
below? With this added, the kernel will produce a stackdump whenever
jackd does an 'illegal' sleep.
Also, could you do a small modification to kernel/sched.c and remove
this line:
		send_sig(SIGUSR1, current, 1);
just to make it easier to get Jack up and running. (by default an
atomicity violation triggers a signal to make it easier to debug it in
userspace, but i suspect there will be alot of such violations so jackd
would stop all the time.)
