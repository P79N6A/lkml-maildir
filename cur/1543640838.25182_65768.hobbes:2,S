Hello!
First, anyone know why I get this when trying to log onto #kernel IRC
channel?
  greear sets mode +i greear
--- You have been killed by mid.eu.linuxnet.org (Username))

--- Disconnected (Remote host closed socket).
Now, for the real question:  I'm making pktgen threaded.  It works great on
a single processor (compiled for single processor).  But, it hangs quickly
when used on an SMP (Athlon 2Ghz-equiv) machine.
I put in print statements (I would love to hear other ideas for how to debug)
and it seems that the system hangs trying to unlock a spin lock.  Specifically,
I see the first printout, but not the second:
inline static void pg_unlock(struct pktgen_thread_info* pg_thread, char* msg) {
         if (debug > 1) {
                 printk("before pg_unlock thread, thread: %x  msg: %s\n",
                        pg_thread, msg);
         }
         spin_unlock(&(pg_thread->pg_threadlock));
         if (debug > 1) {
                 printk("after pg_unlock thread, thread: %x  msg: %s\n",
                        pg_thread, msg);
         }
}
Any ideas for how to go about debugging this will be greatly appreciated!
Thanks,
Ben
