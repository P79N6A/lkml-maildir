May be just me, not matter what I tried, it still doesn't work. Closest I 
can get is to use "resume=/dev/sda" on boot, able to suspend, able to 
resume to X windows, can do anything, but can't access disk. ... simple 
"ls" would hang. Dmesg is show SATA disk timeout.
I've tried both "piix" and "ahci". Both suspend to disk and mem.
My config ...
 	CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND=y
 	CONFIG_PM_STD_PARTITION="/dev/sda3"
 	CONFIG_SUSPEND_SMP=y
 	CONFIG_SUSPEND2_CRYPTO=y
 	CONFIG_SUSPEND2=y
 	CONFIG_SUSPEND2_SWAPWRITER=y
 	CONFIG_SUSPEND2_DEFAULT_RESUME2="swap:/dev/sda3"
 	CONFIG_SUSPEND_SHARED=y
Tried suspending via ...
 	echo shutdown > /sys/power/disk; echo disk > /sys/power/state
 	echo platform > /sys/power/disk; echo disk > /sys/power/state
 	echo mem > /sys/power/state
Grub.cfg ...
 	linux /linux/bzc1 root=/dev/sda2 resume=/dev/sda3
To use "piix" ...
 	Power On -> BIOS Setup -> SATA -> select "Compatibility"
To use "ahci" ...
 	Power On -> BIOS Setup -> SATA -> select "AHCI"
Linux version is 2.6.17-rc2. IBM X60s is Pentium D, so SMP ... may be this 
has something to do with it.
I would really like to get suspend to work, so whatever ideas you've, I'm 
willing to try it.
Thanks,
Jeff.
PS. Official email jchua at fedex dot com, but simply got too much spam at 
jeffchua@silk.corp.fedex.com and not easy to access as I'm travelling now.
