Thanks! Please also look at spinlock-based implementation,

I must admit, Alan was right: it really looks simpler and the perfomance
penalty should be very low. I personally hate this additional spinlock
per se as a "unneeded complication", but probably you will like it more.

My understanding is the same. Actually, smp_read_barrier_depends() can't
help because 'atomic_inc' and '->completed++' in synchronize_xxx() could
be re-ordered anyway, so we should rely on correctness of atomic_t.

Note that synchronize_xxx() does nothing when there are no readers under
xxx_read_lock(), so
	for (;;)
		synchronize_xxx();
can't suspend xxx_read_lock(). atomic_inc_not_zero() fails when something like
the events below happen between 'idx = sp->completed' and 'atomic_inc_not_zero'
	- another reader does xxx_read_lock(), increments ->ctr.
	- synchronize_xxx() notices it, goes to __wait_event()
	- both the reader and writer manage to do atomic_dec()
This is possible in theory, but indefinite delay... Look, we have the same
"problem" with spinlocks: in theory synchronize_xxx() calls might indefinitely
delay an unlucky reader because synchronize_xxx() always wins spin_lock(&sp->lock);

Yes, the whole patch goes to kernel/rcutorture.c, it is only for
testing/review.
Note: I suspect that Documentation/ lies about atomic_add_unless(), see
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=116448966030359
so synchronize_xxx() should be
	void synchronize_xxx(struct xxx_struct *sp)
	{
		int idx;
		smp_mb();
		mutex_lock(&sp->mutex);
		idx = sp->completed & 0x1;
		if (atomic_read(sp->ctr + idx) == 1)
			goto out;
		atomic_inc(sp->ctr + (idx ^ 0x1));
		sp->completed++;
		atomic_dec(sp->ctr + idx);
		wait_event(sp->wq, !atomic_read(sp->ctr + idx));
	out:
		mutex_unlock(&sp->mutex);
	}
Yes, Alan was right, spinlock_t makes the code simpler.
