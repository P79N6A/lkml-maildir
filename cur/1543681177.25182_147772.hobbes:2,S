Why put all of these extra directories in /proc?  We talked about this
before...
What are you trying to "transition to"?  What do you want to see this
look like when you are finished?  And are you prepared to patch all of
the userspace programs that currently rely on the existing interface
(like XFree86 for one)?
Also, I don't think you are handling the pci domain space in your patch,
or am I just missing it?
And your patch was linewrapped :)
