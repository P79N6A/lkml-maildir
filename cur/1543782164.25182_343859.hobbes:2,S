Well, right; but those 'only' cause system to crash during suspend. I
was talking about really dangerous stuff.
Both usb and cpufreq seems to work okay here.
I've added FAQ entry at the end:
Q: What information is usefull for debugging suspend-to-disk problems?
A: Well, last messages on the screen are always useful. If something
is broken, it is usually some kernel driver, therefore trying with as
little as possible modules loaded helps a lot. I also prefer people to
suspend from console, preferably without X running. Booting with
init=/bin/bash, then swapon and starting suspend sequence manually
usually does the trick. Then it is good idea to try with latest
vanilla kernel.
"Known problematic" modules are; be sure to unload them before
suspend:
- DRI being used in X where the drivers don't properly support
suspend/resume (NVidia esp)
- Firewire
- SCSI

I do not want to encourage people to do that. Yep, its probably safe,
no, I do not want them to know.
