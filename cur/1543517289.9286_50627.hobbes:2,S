A ramdisk *is* the cached copy.

What for?  The ramdisk lives in the cache --- there is no other copy
--- and so it cannot be uncached!
If you wanted a different sort of ramdisk you could write one, but if
you want to access it as a block device, it will necessarily use the
buffer cache anyway: that is an invariant of all block devices (the
whole point of block devices vs. character devices is that there is a
uniform buffer cache access mechanism to all block devices).
