Guys,
I just noticed that sound drivers use the address from
pci_alloc_consistent() as the input to virt_to_page() all
over the place. I looked into the Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt,
and it says:
  This routine will allocate RAM for that region, so it acts similarly to
  __get_free_pages (but takes size instead of a page order).
I know for fact I got it wrong in sparc in whole 2.4, and it seems
RMK got it wrong in arm. I suggest other architecture maintainers
to look at it ASAP. May even be oopsabe, by indexing outside of
mem_map[] with a suitable sound driver.
