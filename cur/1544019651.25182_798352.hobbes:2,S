No sure if there is a bug report already or not.
For the macbook pro(ATI chipset) suspend is broken.
As for kernel version: latest git.
Last week(before LCA, and during the week, since being no merges.)
the system would wakeup, show a black screen and sit there. Now
after a couple of merges have been completed The system wakes up,
but instantly reboot's.
I tried to supply any info(ohci1394_dma) when the wakeup occurs, but had 
no response
for some reason or another.
I can try and do a bisect, the only problem
I have though, is I never labeled good/bad commits(forgot how too);
In any case If I'm in an urgent need, of having  to suspend
the system(not in anytime soon at the moment),
then Ill just revert kernels to one that I know works.     :^)
regards;
