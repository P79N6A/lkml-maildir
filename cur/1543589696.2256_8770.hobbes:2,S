yes but I use an network device specific ioctl call wich perform interface-specific
ioctl commands.
the prototype of the ioctl reception in the module is (as described in rubini book,
O reilly, linux device drivers):
int (*do_ioctl) (struct device *dev, struct ifreq *ifr, int cmd);
so can I pass over the limitations of the definition ?
I do ioctl that use private ioctl flags (e.g. SIOCDEVPRIVATE)
