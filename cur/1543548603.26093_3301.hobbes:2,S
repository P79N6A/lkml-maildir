An important lesson for me was 'the timing is never right'. Bite the bullet,
and things will be all right. Fear-of-merging is a well known programmer
phenomenon, best solved by: merging.
Of course NFS has some influence on bugreports but the crosstalk should be
minimal.
I just merged a chunk of code in my non-open source project and I now feel
that I waited far too long. The same might go for NFS.
