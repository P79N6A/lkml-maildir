Subject: 2.2.17pre14 3ware support may be broken

I just compiled and booted 2.2.17pre14 on a machine which was
previously running 2.2.17pre9.
The machine panics during boot right after the line:
FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077
The next line in a 2.2.17pre9 boot log would generally be
scsi0 : 3ware Storage Controller
Instead I get a panic and some message about a5a5a5a5a5.
Nothing is written to any logs.
The machine is an AMD K7/850 with 896MB RAM and
a 3ware 5400.
