I killed the I/O write/read macros and switched the driver to iomap.

Subject: [PATCH] IP1000 Gigabit Ethernet device driver
This is a cleaned up fork of the IP1000A device driver:
  <
http://www.icplus.com.tw/driver-pp-IP1000A.html>
Open issues include but are not limited to:
  - ipg_probe() looks really fishy and doesn't handle all errors
    (e.g. ioremap failing).
  - ipg_nic_do_ioctl() is playing games with user-space pointer.
    We should use ethtool ioctl instead as suggested by Arjan.
  - For multiple devices, the driver uses a global root_dev and
    ipg_remove() play some tricks which look fishy.
I don't have the hardware, so I don't know if I broke anything.
The patch is 138 KB in size, so I am not including it in this
mail. You can find the patch here:
