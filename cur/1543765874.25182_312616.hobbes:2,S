You don't either? Good. :)

That would make sense. I'm not familiar with the workings of cpusets,
but that would require every task to be assigned to one of these
sets (or a subset within it), yes?

Sounds like a good fit then. I'll touch up the sched-domains side of
the equation when I get some time hopefully this week or next.
