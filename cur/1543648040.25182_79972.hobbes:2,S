That was exactly the behaviour I noticed.  I believe it's because when you
run two side-by-side, they cook each other (I'm assuming you didn't run
2 2-ports side-by-side)
Try strapping a fan on them somehow and I bet all your troubles go
away (and maybe your .ibm email will shame Intel into putting heat-sinks
and/or small fans on their NICs... ;)
(I ran two Netgear 302t NICs (tigon-3) side-by-side for 4 days at max speed, and they
  didn't drop a single packet, even though their heat-sinks were too hot to
  touch!)
