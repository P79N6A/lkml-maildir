We're now using a system-dependent wrapper library 'libpciaccess' for
all of this stuff, it uses 64-bits for all PCI addresses and should make
this transparent to the X driver.
In addition, our kernel drivers are moving to support graphics cards
that have memory beyond that addressable through their aperture, so we
should be able to manage cards with even more memory, some of which is
not reachable from the CPU.

And that code has been replaced with an even more general library that
abstracts away all of the PCI routing issues.

Trying a libpciaccess-based X server is certainly something worth doing,
that should be 1.4 or later (thanks, git-describe).

There is an additional single-page BAR on 9xx chips which may end up
mapped and not documented. Our kernel driver should correctly deal with
that now though.
