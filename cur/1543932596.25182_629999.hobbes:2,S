i dont think it's required for C3 to even turn off any portion of the 
CPU - if an interrupt arrives after the C3 sequence is initiated but 
just before dirty cachelines have been flushed then the CPU can just 
return without touching anything (such as the TLB) - right? So i dont 
think there's any implicit guarantee of TLB flushing (nor should there 
be), but in practice, a good C3 sequence would (statistically) turn off 
large portions of the CPU and hence the TLB as well.
