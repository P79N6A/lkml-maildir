Hello,
I would like to send the latest 2.6.6 kernel patch for 
the Renesas M32R processor.
Patch information to the stock 2.6.6 kernel is placed as follows:
- m32r architecture dependent portions (arch/m32r, include/asm-m32r)
  
http://www.linux-m32r.org/public/linux-2.6.6_m32r_20040528.arch-m32r.patch
In this M32R kernel,
- OProfile is newly supported.
- Architecture-dependent portion codes have been modified for gcc-3.4.0.
Best Regards,
