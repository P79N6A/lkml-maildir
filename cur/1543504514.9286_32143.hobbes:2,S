Subject: unresolved symbols in modules in 2.3.12

When Scsi support is built as a module, I get
scsi_mod.o: unresolved symbol : init_task_union
"update_vm_cache" is called in a number of fs-types, declared in
pagetable.h, but defined nowhere.  This hits home in fs/fat support.
"hpfs_writepage" is called in the hpfs code, but not defined anywhere.
