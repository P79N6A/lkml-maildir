look back into your mail store. I said this pretty early.

No, I always thought the 50% RAM was a terrible hack. And IMHO it is
one of the biggest usability gaps of tmpfs.

I definitely want them to go there. It is a very sophisticated
mechinsm because by adding swap on _any_ storage I can grow my tmpfs
instances even temporarily.
If you now were able to take advantage of additional swap
automatically administration would be a no brainer. Also distributions
could add much saner defaults for /dev/shm or even use it for /tmp.
