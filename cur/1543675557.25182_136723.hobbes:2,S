Maybe interesting for someone,
I have many slabs, and what we have in common is
e100 and I have an saa7134 (TV card too) all other is different
But I don't use my tv card at all.
I remember there is two differrents e100 drivers which one do you use ?
e100 one or eepro100 one ?, personally I use the e100 one.
Regards.
Nicolas.
