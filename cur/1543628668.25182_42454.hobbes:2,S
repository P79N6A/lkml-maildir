Again, you charge ahead instead of just getting it fixed... It's not a
lot of work!
If you want to disable the TCQ stuff until this is fixed, fine, I have
no objection to that. Completely ripping it out is a silly decision.
First you blast ahead and include even before I ask you or sent it to
Linus myself, now you remove it without my consent as well. A bit of
consistency would get you a long way.
