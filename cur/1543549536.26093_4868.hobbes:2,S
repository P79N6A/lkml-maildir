hi!
this is related to previous problem,
when i tried to allocate 64k of physical memory by calling
kmalloc(64*1024-1, GFP_KERNEL), it allocated the memory, also wrote the
memory, but when i read it, it gave Ayeei message, saying interrupt
handlers has been killed..and computer hanged, its kernel-2.2.14-5.0
what could be the reason??
note:please cc the answer
