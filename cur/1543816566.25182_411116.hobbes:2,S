Hmm, there were XFS patches in -mm last week, but they also got
merged to mainline last week, not clear whether your git kernel
had those changes or not.  I think there's probably some direct
I/O (generic) changes in -mm too based on list traffic from the
last couple of weeks (I'm an -mm lamer, sorry, couldn't easily
tell you exactly what patches those might be) - could you retry
with todays git snapshot and see if mainline is affected?  Else
we'll need to find and analyse any -mm fs/direct-io.c patches.
cheers.
