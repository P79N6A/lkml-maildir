We cant continue to use files from lib/ in arch/powerpc/boot when they
start to use kernel internals like kmalloc. I converted a few
zlib_inflate files with sed already. But things will get really ugly if
we have to do more on-the-fly modifications. After all,
arch/$ARCH/boot is no kernel code, it has to be standalone.
Maybe we should just have no arch/powerpc/boot.
