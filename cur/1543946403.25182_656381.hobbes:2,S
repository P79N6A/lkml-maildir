?
The current behaviour is to return bytes tee'd, or return -EAGAIN for
zero bytes if SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK is set. It doesn't return "-EAGAIN on
success", not sure what you mean there.

Perhaps it's just me, but this doesn't make a lot of sense. You override
any other error with EAGAIN, hm? In fact the only < 0 value that
link_pipe() will return is -EPIPE, which is perfectly in sync with that
a pipe write will return if there are no readers attached.
