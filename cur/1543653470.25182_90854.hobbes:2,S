I know.
I'm hoping Linus intentionally dropped it, because it's silly.  See the 
other message I just posted.  It's redundant because the module loader 
can obviously figure out there is no init nor exit routine.  It's just 
like EXPORT_NO_SYMBOLS: redundant and obvious.

Why the fsck is Rusty's new module code requiring all these driver 
changes???  Note from your message above that there are "dozens" of 
modules which worked just fine, but now they need to be changed under 
Rusty's new system.
I thought Rusty's new stuff was going to cause minimal to no driver 
breakage.  You know, at kernel summit there was the thought that we 
should just disable module -un-loading.  I wish he had stuck with that 
simple idea, plus module_param [because MODULE_PARM obviously sucks].
