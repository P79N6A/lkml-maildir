I'm not seeing why ndiswrapper should be treated separately.
If it loads non-GPL modules, it shouldn't be able to use GPLONLY symbols.
So if ndiswrapper needs GPL-only symbols, you'd better ask the people who 
made those symbols GPL-only whether they could be made available to 
ndiswrapper.
ndiswrapper itself is *not* compatible with the GPL. Trying to claim that 
ndiswrapper somehow itself is GPL'd even though it then loads modules that 
aren't is stupid and pointless. Clearly it just re-exports those GPLONLY 
functions to code that is *not* GPL'd.
