Right now we tend to queue 128 blocks per write. That can be tuned if you
want to play with it.

Im not sure the best way to get big linear blocks in the ext2 layout or
if perhaps XFS would do that job better, but the physical layer comes
down the the block limit, scsi max sectors per I/O set by the controller
and to an extent the vm readahead (tunable in -ac kernels - the patch
to md.c should tell you how to hack md for that)
