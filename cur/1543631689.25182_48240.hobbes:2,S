The "serice" in this cause is not sourcecode, or an other product, it is
an idea. I totally agree with you that when you want to derive from GPL
software you should comply with its license. This is not about deriving
software, this is about the use of an idea, which happens to be made
into a patent (by a patent office with a very questionable reputation,
also in this case as lots of ppl pointed out before).

Those statements are mostly valid for copyright cases, where i derive a
piece of software from a other piece of software. These are very hard to
map to patent cases like this one is. Cause if this was about deriving
software, RTAI developers would have no problem with FSMLabs at all,
cause we write our own software or we comply to the license of the
software we use (keep in mind that RTAI was LGPL, and is now GPL, so
RTAI itself is in no way colliding with the GPL). It is about users of
RTAI that might want to keep their program non-GPL, and the question is,
are they allowed to. Since they are not deriving from RTAI (they just
use the services it offers) they are free to do so, when it would be a
simple copyright case, but FSMLabs thinks different on this point. So
thats what this is all about, where does the patent "stop" ? that
question was always pushed into the copyright corner, and never answered
correctly, apart by Eben Moglen, who apparently is not qualified enough
to say anything on this topic (when i have to believe some ppl).
