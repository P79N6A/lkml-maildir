I have also had this problem. Here is my output from free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         62104      21296      40808          0       1440       8800
-/+ buffers/cache:      11056      51048
Swap:      2113536          0    2113536
I have 64MB of RAM and 128MB of swap, on my Sony VAIO 505TR running
2.3.23. At one time its said I had over 600 megs of swap...
