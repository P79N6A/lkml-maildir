by the same argument the 2.6 i386 vsyscall is not acceptable too since
it has an hardcoded address too that is the same for all binary kernels
that you ship, and furthmore it has the sysenter or int 0x80 hardcoded
at a fixed address to jump into. In short either you claim the 2.6.2
i386 code as broken the way glibc calls into it, or x86-64 is perfectly
fine too. so your claims makes very little sense to me.
