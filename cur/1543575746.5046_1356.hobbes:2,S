Your guess? 8) Of course, it is incorrect. I even have no idea
how it is possible to put system into such sad state.
Though... probably, you forgot to up loopback.

I think it is consequence of above. When loopback interface is missing,
networking does not work.

Rather it means that openbsd is buggy, its stack accepts packets
not destined to it. It cannot react to those strange packets, which
you have just described.
