To fix the gcc-3.4 lvalue warnings in drivers/atm/idt77105.c, 2.6 does:
at line 267:
-	if (!(PRIV(dev) = kmalloc(sizeof(struct ......
+	if (!(dev->dev_data = kmalloc(sizeof(struct ......
and at line 345:
-		PRIV(dev) = NULL;
+		dev->dev_data = NULL;
(see 2.6 bk-repo, cset-1.1371.280.43)
But the define for PRIV is (2.6, line 44):
#define PRIV(dev) ((struct idt77105_priv *) dev->phy_data)
So it seems the correct change should be change those "PRIV(dev) ="
into "dev->phy_data =" not "dev->dev_data =".
