Memory is not something that is difficult to track. Its likely one of two things:
a) Your card now has 3d support, hooray! and X is mapping more regions, which
isn't really additional RAM usage.
b) Linux is caching more things, hooray! I'm not saying that you are one of
those people who just looks at the free number and doesn't think any further,
but you might be.
or c, the kernel has another 250MB is kernel data structures, seems unlikely.
