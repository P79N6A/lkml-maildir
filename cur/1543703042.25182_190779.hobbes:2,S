I've noticed a similar problem here since upgrading to 2.6. In my case
not has NFS performance gone through the floor vs 2.4.22 but so has
machine performance during the transfer. In 2.4 the machine would be a
bit sluggish but usable...under 2.6 the machine is more or less
*unusable* until the NFS transfer completes. Trying to say, open up
Evolution may take upwards of ten minutes to complete. Unfortunately due
to the extreme performance problem it's not even possible to do any
diagnostics on the machine while it's happening.
