Yes.
Does this *only* happens for sd (scsi) devices?

OK, thanks for posting those links and information.

sd.c always calls its revalidate_disk method (sd_revalidate_disk) when the
device is attached, so for scsi, we definitely do not miss anything.
I thought revalidate_disk was not called prior to Al's patch, so why do we
need to call it on the first open now?
You already have to call set_capacity() before add_disk(), else
register_disk thinks there is no media present, and won't set
bd_invalidated. So drivers must already get the capacity (or fake it)
prior to calling add_disk.
