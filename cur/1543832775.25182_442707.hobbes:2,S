You mean it will not bomb? Good, but still there is I2C question
- can I2C accesses to the graphics chip corrupt X11 and vice versa?
I can't see anything preventing that, and while we can disable
graphic operations while Xserver is running, we can't disable I2C
(non-DDC).
Probably X11 should be disallowed to use I2C directly? I should
probably Cc: this to XOrg as well...
