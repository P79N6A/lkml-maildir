At least on x86 & x64 both i8259A and optional IOAPIC are initially
fully masked until a driver decides to open up a line.
If driver initialization fails then it should never open up the line on
the interrupt controller. So this shouldn't be a problem with interrupts
or am I missing something?
Shared interrupt lines do present a problem however as someone else gets
the chance to scream on an open line ultimately killing it, hmmm.
