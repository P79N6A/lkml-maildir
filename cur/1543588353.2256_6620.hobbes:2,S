It's has to be a multiple of 8 because of how e2fsprogs handles
bitmaps --- that is, it takes the various pieces of all of the
bitmaps, and butts them up together in memory.  It would be possible
to remove this restriction by reworking the e2fsprogs library code,
but quite frankly, I don't think the restriction is all that
unreasonable.
