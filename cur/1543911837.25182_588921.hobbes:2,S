I've got some addition grips that I just noticed ..
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8945
I just file the above bugz entry ..
I know who caused the bug , Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com> ..
However I can't assign the bug to him. The field was greyed out and
forced the assignee as other_other@kernel-bugs.osdl.org ..
I tryed to CC: eranian@hpl.hp.com , and it said "no match" .. I guess
because he doesn't have an account.. So Stephane has no way to know the
bug exists , other than me emailing him ..
Also I couldn't check the "Regression" box until after I filed the bug..
It would be nice to file the bug in one action if it's possible .. I
don't know bugzilla well enough to know if that's possible tho.
