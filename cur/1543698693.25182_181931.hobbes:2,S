	The GPL says:
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
	So how is running the program infringement of a license that clearly says
executing is unrestricted? How do you execute without copying into RAM?
(Again, a license to do X is automatically a license to do anything
necessary to do X.)

	This argument is pure bootstrapping. If the glue code is a license boundary
(which is most likely its purpose) that is has no infringing use!
