There are some non-Intel ACPI (dumping) tools in CVS (acpidump and
pmtools/acpi*) at this SF.net project:
  
https://sourceforge.net/projects/acpi/
I expect that I need to make those available as tarballs.
And Len has pmtools (and dmidecode) available here:
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/utils/
However, I'm not aware of any of these decompiling the SSDT...
