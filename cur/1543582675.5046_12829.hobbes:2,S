If you have a lot of buffers you can try one thing to see if its IRQ load,
turn the IRQ off, set a fast timer running and hook the buffer handling to
the timer irq.
Next obvious step would be using the timer based irq handling to limit the
number of buffers you use netif_rx() on and discard any others.
Finally don't rule out memory bandwidth, if the ram is main memory then the
dma engine could be pretty much driving the cpu off the bus  at high data
rates.
