Hello!
Is there any way to specify what local IP address an NFS
client uses to mount an NFS server?
For instance, if I have eth0 with IP 192.168.1.6 and eth1
with IP 192.168.1.7, how can I make sure that a particular
mount point is accessed via 192.168.1.7?
If not NFS..can it be done with SMB?
The current man pages seem to indicate it cannot be done, but
maybe someone knows some kludge to get it working?
Thanks,
Ben
