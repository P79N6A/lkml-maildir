What about results with latest -aa kernels? 
I'm writing this letter while running your killer-test ;)
My machine is perfectly responsive.
$ uname -a
Linux localhost 2.4.19-pre6vm33 #2 Sat Apr 13 00:56:55 MSD 2002 i686 unknown
This is vanilla 2.4.19-pre6 + vm33 from Andrea Arcangelly.
Funny stats:
bash-2.05$ free
total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        516496     512804       3692          0       2080      10064
-/+ buffers/cache:     500660      15836
Swap:      1028120    1028120          0
I'm running X, netscape, mutt, top, 5 xterms, web, mysql, ftp, samba etc.
Lots of "0-order allocation failed" in the log. Anyway it is usable!
The good thing is VM is killing right process most of the time: 
VM: killing process memory-killer
Netscape got killed. Big deal, I can start it again and it works... 
P.S. Running it already for 20 minutes.
