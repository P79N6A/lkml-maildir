	It seems to be true. At lest I can't crush my slackware linux.
Here is ver_linux output:
Linux irina 2.2.0-pre7 #2 Thu Jan 21 21:51:06 EET 1999 i586 unknown

	But even if this problem exists only on RH dists it MUST be fixed
by changing something in kernel. IMHO any errors in any user space programs
including ldd & libc does not lead to system crush or unwanted reboot.
