I am trying to port the Userlink driver (used for IPsec) to 2.4.0-test10.  I 
have 2 questions:
Firstly has anyone already done this?
Secondly, how do I re-write the following code to work with 2.4.0?
static int
net_ul_start(struct net_device *dev)
{
    dev->start = 1;
    dev->tbusy = 0;
    return(0);
} 
Thanks.
