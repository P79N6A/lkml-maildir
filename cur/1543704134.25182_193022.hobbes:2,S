Dear all,
      I have just put online a survey addressing the topic "good
leadership in the open-source environment". Basically, my objective is to
identify the personal conceptions of good leadership that reside in
the minds of the contributors, in terms of leaders' _behaviors_ and
_characteristics_.
What is a good open-source project leader, from the contributor's point of
view? To what extent, those personal believes are shared among developers?
Can the contributor's national cultural belonging and level of experience in
contributing to open-source projects explain such differences in their idea
of what a good leader is?
I would really appreciate your participation to the survey! Contribution
(completely anonymous) consists in rating a list of statements that may be
used to describe the behaviors of an open-source leader. It will take around
ten minutes - there aren't any "time-consuming" open ended questions;)
Following, the link to the survey:

If you are interested, I will not miss to email you a link to the
final report, when ready ;) (approx, a couple of months from now)
Thank you in advance, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have
any questions or comments :)
