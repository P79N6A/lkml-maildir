Is anyone working to get ISDN (hisax driver ;) work in 2.6.0-textX kernels?
My problem is a "totally kernel freeze" trying to load hisax module... this 
happens in all 2.6.0-testX kernels.
My ISDN card: "Hamlet PCI ISDN CARD":
00:0d.0 Network controller: Cologne Chip Designs GmbH ISDN network 
controller [HFC-PCI] (rev 02)
        Subsystem: Cologne Chip Designs GmbH ISDN Board
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 16, IRQ 5
        I/O ports at 8400 [disabled] [size=8]
        Memory at df000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=256]
        Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 1
My CONFIG: (2.6.0-testX)
# ISDN subsystem
#
CONFIG_ISDN_BOOL=y
 
#
# Old ISDN4Linux
#
CONFIG_ISDN=y
CONFIG_ISDN_PPP=y
CONFIG_ISDN_PPP_VJ=y
#
# ISDN4Linux hardware drivers
#
 
#
# Passive cards
#
CONFIG_ISDN_DRV_HISAX=m
 
#
# D-channel protocol features
#
CONFIG_HISAX_EURO=y
CONFIG_HISAX_MAX_CARDS=1
                                                                                                                               
#
# HiSax supported cards
#
CONFIG_HISAX_HFC_PCI=y
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
when I try to load the "hisax" module the kernel freezes, I can only push 
the reset button.
The last line printed is "HFC_PCI: resetting card".
Using some "printk" I found the point where the freeze happens:
drivers/isdn/hisax/hfc_pci.c  -->  hfcpci_reset(struct IsdnCardState *cs)
...
        /* Finally enable IRQ output */
        cs->hw.hfcpci.int_m2 = HFCPCI_IRQ_ENABLE;
        Write_hfc(cs, HFCPCI_INT_M2, cs->hw.hfcpci.int_m2);        <-- HERE!
        if (Read_hfc(cs, HFCPCI_INT_S2));
...
So the problem happens trying to enable IRQ on the ISDN Card....
Has anyone an idea of what can be wrong?
(The problem isn't about CONFIG_PREEMPT because I try with and without it).
Bye
