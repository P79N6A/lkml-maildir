__put_page() has gone.
A lot of the VM duplication has gone.
tree_lock is still there a bit.  For two reasons:
a) A presently-unneeded duplication of the generic
   __set_page_dirty_nobuffers() and
b) Manipulation of the fake inode (I think).
   iirc the base problem here is that for whatever reason, the usual
   blockdev inode which filesystems use for metadata (ie: the pagecache
   which backs sb_bread(), etc) isn't suitable.  reiser4 wants to get a
   hold of its address_space ops, so it needs to create its own
   covers-all-the-partition, identify-mapped address_space.

It's better.  More reviewing help is always appreciated ;)
