No, the offset of the arguments > 5 on the stack is 96 bytes on 31 bit and
160 bytes on 64 bit, period. This won't change because it is ABI relevant.

Well my first implementation had the arguments outside the pt_regs. But
I came to the conclusion that this is wrong. First of all pt_regs is
supposed to describe what is put on the stack during a system call and
this includes the additional parameter. The second, more important
thing is that without a structure describing exactly what's put on the
stack it is impossible for lcrash or crash to decode the system entry
stack frame. This is something we definitly want to have.
I though about the implications of the pt_regs changes for some time.
Since the pt_regs structure is solely used to put the register on the
kernel stack I don't see a problem. Every other structure is independent
of it (at least in the 2.6 kernels).
