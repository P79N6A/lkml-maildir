FWIW,
$ find -name "*.c" | xargs grep "any later version" | wc -l
3138
$ find -name "*.c" | wc -l
9482
Watching the output of the first grep without "wc -l" shows that, 
although it is not 100% accurate, it is still ok just to get a rough 
estimate.
So yes, ~6300 files are definitely more than a couple ;)
