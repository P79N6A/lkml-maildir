Cycles for the whole routines alloc_skb and __kfree_skb are as follows:
Baseline 2.5.25
----------------
       alloc/free average cycles
       -------------------------
Runs:      1st              2nd          3rd
CPU0:    337/1163       336/1132      304/1100
CPU1:    318/1164       309/1153      311/1127
2.5.25+skbinit patch
--------------------
       alloc/free average cycles
       -------------------------
Runs:      1st          2nd            3rd
CPU0:   447/1015       580/846        402/905
CPU1:   419/1003       383/915        547/856
The above figures indicate that the cycles spent in alloc_skb and
__kfree_skb have gained 5% in the patch case.  However if you
take the absolute cycles and average them for the three runs it
comes around 145 cycles saving that is close to what I posted earlier
by measuring just the changed code. As the scope of the code measured
widens the percentage improvement comes down.
So the first two scopes, 1. measuring the cycles spent in changed code
2. measuring the cycles spent in alloc_skb and __kfree_skb, results
are consistent.
The third scope would be measuring this patch in a workload environment.
We measured it in a web serving workload and found that we get 0.7%
improvement.
I would like to stress again that this patch helps only when the
allocations
and frees occur on two different CPUs.  I measured it in a UNI system and
did not see any impact.

Then the testing technique is flawed.  You should include all of the
operations included in an alloc_skb/kfree_skb pair in order to see
the overall effect of the change, otherwise your change could have a
net negative effect which would not be noticed.
