Thanks. In case Linus applied the patch this is unimportant.
In case he didnt I'll probably resubmit when 2.5.75 comes out
and apply your polishing.

True. But it is only in the compatibility code.
Once you rip that out the special casing disappears automatically.
It describes current reality.

People tell me jari-loop is much faster at present.
If this is true, your move would not be very popular.
Anyway, I am not doing a redesign. Just a cleanup.
