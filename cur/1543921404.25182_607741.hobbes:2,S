Sounds like you don't have the tags. Do
	git fetch --tags <repo> 
to get them.
There can be several reasons why you don't have the tags, but the two most 
likely ones are:
 - really old versions of git didn't fetch tags by default.
   (not very likely, because it's *really* old, but still, worth 
   mentioning as one possible reason)
 - if you don't fetch into a "tracking" branch, but instead do an 
   "anonymous" fetch into FETCH_HEAD that is then directly merged (or you 
   just rebase your work on top of it), git won't fetch tags, since it 
   assumes that you only want to fetch the one head you mentioned.
but regardless, you can always fetch the tags manually.
