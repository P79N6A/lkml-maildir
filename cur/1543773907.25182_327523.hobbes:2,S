Well, if user marks her fs as iso-8859-1 that means that she doesn't
want it to contain filenames unrepresentable in this particular
codepage. Aleksey has begun the whole thread because in Russia there are
several, equally popular, different encodings for the same alphabet. And
in this context his proposal is quite good: develope general, fs
independent NLS layer.

ls(1) displays either \0nnn or ?. Or maybe some other mangling could be
done, however, octal representation seems to be ok.

OK. Let me be more general: fixed char width encodings. AFAIK Japanese
encodigs use 16bits, yet it is still fixed width.

Mount options. See the letter from Kyle Moffett

[ good filesystem for portable media ]

Maybe. I don't think that digital cameras or audio players will suppoty
UDF though. But that is something completly differnent.
