Sysrq still prints stuff, so IRQs aren't locked.  But most of the sysrq
commands don't work... S and U don't seem to do anything (not too
suprising I suppose) but B does reboot.

So I added i8042.noaux to my kernel command line, rebooted, insmodded
intel_agp, started X, and verified no touchpad action.  Then I
suspended, and it worked fine.  After restart, I suspended again - also
fine.
So I think that fixed it.  But no touchpad is a bit annoying. :)
