In my experience, Windows doesn't really allow you to "execute" these
files from the command line, per se.  You have a file manager (explorer)
which does a look up and determines which program to run on the file.
This would be easy to do for linux, but is not a kernel issue.
As for macintosh, I've never seen the command line interface, although
I assume there is some emergency mode somewhere that has a prompt, so
the GUI is the UI.  It seemed to me (last time I used a Mac), that the
"resource forks" must have the executable name in them somewhere.
(Or maybe all of the data files start with "#!/bin/MacPaint" ......)
