Hi,
I'd like to make a physical copy of a failing IDE drive. The problem is, 
I don't know in advance where the bad sectors lie. As a consequence, the 
copying process tries to copy those sectors; for each failing sector, 
the kernel tries, gets an error, tries again etc...
Is it possible to ask the kernel to give up immediately on a failed IDE 
sector?
Regards.
