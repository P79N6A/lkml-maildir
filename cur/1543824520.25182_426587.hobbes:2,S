A while ago I worked on cleaning up the emulator that was first written 
by SciTech, and then used by X and LinuxBIOS people.
The .text size of the emulator went from 59478 to 38225 bytes, but I bet 
I could shrink it even further. The emulator was a bit optimized for 
speed, but IMHO we want it optimized for size.
If I can get the emulator to use, say, 20kB, wouldn't it be better to 
have it in the kernel instead of as user-space helper?
This would allow the graphics driver to call BIOS functions as if they 
were regular functions, i.e., you could call on a BIOS function to set 
the graphics mode and continue execution when the BIOS function completes.
A user mode helper will always be more cumbersome from a programming 
POV. Not to mention that it would be a lot easier for distro maintainers...
