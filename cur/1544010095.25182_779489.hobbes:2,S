Hmm, I hadn't noticed that.  For a while the X86 devel kernel had an
"additional_cpus=n" parameter, which was also a bit confusing.  Say you
wanted, 64 total, you had to give the increment over how many you already
had [e.g., (want)64 - (have)16  = (additional_cpus=)48.]
I just figured that re-using the same kernel parameter was better than adding
another.  But I'm willing to go either way.
Btw, I did alter the Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt file:
        maxcpus=        [SMP] Maximum number of processors that an SMP kernel
                        should make use of.  maxcpus=n : n >= 0 limits the
                        kernel to using 'n' processors.  n=0 is a special case,
                        it is equivalent to "nosmp", which also disables
                        the IO APIC.  On [X86] maxcpus can also be used to
                        extend the number of possible cpus to overcome ACPI
                        tables that do not indicate disabled cpus, as well as
                        allow for additional cpus to be HOT PLUGGED in.
                        Format: <0-NR_CPUS>
In modifying the code, I could not find any arch-specific instances and the only
general case was in the 3 references in init/main.c, so I figured it was pretty
safe to use.
Thanks,
Mike
