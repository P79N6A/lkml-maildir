it's definitely not right: this disk sustains around 35 MB/s.

nonsequitur: the controller and disk are both quite capable of 
sustaining 20-35 MB/s (depending on zone.)  here's hdparm output
for a disk of the same rpm and density as the DTLA's:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  1.07 seconds =119.63 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.02 seconds = 31.68 MB/sec
(maxtor dm+45, hpt366 controller)
