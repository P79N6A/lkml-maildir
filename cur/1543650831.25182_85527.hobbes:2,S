FreeBSD's acpi project is a good example.
http://www.jp.freebsd.org/acpi/index.html
(though this page doesn't seem to reflect recent status)
They share the same code base (OS-independent part) as Linux
and troubles FreeBSD had are troubles Linux will have or vice versa.
Its mailing-list is based in Japan but most discussions
are in English and some intel developers are also in the list.
AFAIK the aic7xxx driver has similar structure.
Thanks,
