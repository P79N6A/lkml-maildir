It's beast used in MS Office ? Where you can send you password with document

Now what ? It's still minority and thay will need to do something eventually...
Thay can just avoid new programs based on albods for now. Not a big deal.
We are not M$ and compatibility is not a fetish here...

Not suddenly. After installation of new library needed for GNOME 3.8 :-))
Usual story, not something really new or unexpected. And if library contains
BIG FAT WARNING (like glibc 2.1, for example :-) I can not see problems.

Slow -- may be. Unreliable... Why ? Collizions ? Use some UUID as magic
file name ...

Some error will be returned :-) Not a big deal: there are no programs to work
with albods yet, so it's not a problem to have forbidden name (or may be even
names).

Correct. And now what ? If you want perfect support for Microsoft crap
then use Micosoft's OS, not Linux. Yes, we want to support Windows tools,
Windows clients and Windows filesystems in Linux. But ONLY when it does
not requires changes in non-related to such exchange subsystems. So no,
support for reparse points does not look like requirement. If it's really
needed for something that such support should be added in NTFS driver, not
in some other subsystem.
