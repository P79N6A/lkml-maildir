You might need to explain that one more time . I'm sure it needs more
though, but the pi_lock just protects another cpu from enter
pi_setprio() . What we really want is to protect only the specific
structures modified inside pi_setprio() . Or that's my understanding .
Are you thinking of something else?
I think you would at least need to lock the wait_lock for each lock that
is looped over inside pi_setprio() . Because you access the wait_list
inside the loop .
There is also a pi_waiters list that is per task. You would need to make
a lock for that, I think . Or protect it somehow .
