Right then.  You're completely missing the _PCT, _PPC, and
_PSS packages, as well as the CPU scope they're normally
defined in.  powernow-k8 is not going to work on this system.
If you boot with the 2.6.18 kernel, do you get the same
decompiled DSDT?  If not, there's an ACPI regression you
need to report to Len Brown.
Have you upgraded the processors or BIOS on the box?
