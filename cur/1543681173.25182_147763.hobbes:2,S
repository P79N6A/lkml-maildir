That _only_ works if none of those conditions (a)-(e) applies.
Otherwise, short reads are possible when there is more to come.
Sure, if you're willing to assert that the program is running on
kernel >= 2.5.76, all its fds are for sure TCP sockets and you added
the POLLPRI check, then yes it's fine.
I think mine is better because it works always, and you are free to
code the optimisation in any programs, libraries etc.

Sure, _that_ check is fine.
