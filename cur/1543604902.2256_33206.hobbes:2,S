  Will be a bit more complex than xterm/curses. One of the problem
 is that using the VESA1 interface is needed (DMA restrictions), so
 you need to get back the array given by the Gujin bootloader, describing
 which I/O port to use to switch the 32/64K window at 0xA0000. You do not
 want to go back to real-mode at every VESA1 page change.
 (This array is already available with the current Gujin, using it is
 Gujin native mode for VESA1 cards)

  And the only usual "fast changing" thing is the mouse, so either use a
 hardware extension of the video card or direct PCI write for it only.
 My main question was which bandwidth the standard DMA is able to do
 for memory to memory copy, if it is too slow, do not even start
 to code anything... got no answer. The PC DMA can only copy memory by
 16 bit units - and I am not sure it will behave correctly with
 PCI stalls.

  Lets say, I start just after I finish Gujin; i.e. if you want to see
 something before Linux 3.1, find someone else... I can still help a bit.
