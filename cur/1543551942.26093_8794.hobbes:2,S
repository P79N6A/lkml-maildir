Subject: "Shutdown" not shutting down...

I was wondering if someone could explain something to me.  I've got a
dual-boot Red Hat 6.2/Win95B box, AMD K6-500, NVidia / SGS
Thomson|Riva128 video card w/8MB memory, BTC-1817 sound card, 64MB RAM,
and a Phoebe 56K modem.  On the Win95 side, when I shutdown the system
it goes through the shutdown procedure, and at the end it turns off the
box.
In Linux, "shutdown -h now" results in Linux going through the process,
but at the end I get the following:
Call trace: [<c01079ed>] [<c0101a9c>] [<c0107abd>] [<c01089e3>]

(the above was all that I could see on the screen. if there was anything
prior to the first Call trace, I'm afraid my tired old eyes missed it. 
this was also all manually copied, and manually entered, but I believe
I've gotten it correctly)
Anyone have any idea what I'm doing wrong here?
Thx,
Wolf
