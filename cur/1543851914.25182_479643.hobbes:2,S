but you did take the alignment rules of 64 bit variables into account,
eg 32 bit has it 4 byte aligned, while 64 bit has it 8 byte aligned..
you are 100% sure even your 32 bit structures have all 64 bit values 8
byte aligned?
(you get this automatic if you sort by size)
Also you made sure that if you have such implicit padding that you zero
out the memory between the fields to avoid information leaks?
Sorting by size at least makes this all go away.....
