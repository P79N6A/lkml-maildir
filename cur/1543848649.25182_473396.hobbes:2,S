Subject: Would SSI clustering extensions be of interest to kernel community?

I have implemented SSI (single system image) clustering extensions to 
Linux kernel in the form of a loadable module.
It roughly mimics OpenMosix model of deputy/remote split (migrated 
processes leave a stub on the node where they were born and depend on 
the "home" node for IO).
The implementation shares no code with Mosix/Open Mosix (was written 
from scratch), is much smaller, and is easily portable to multiple 
architectures.
We are considering publication of this code and forming an open source 
project around it.
I have two questions to the community:
1) Is community interested in using this code? Do users require SSI 
product in the era when everybody is talking about partitioning of 
machines and not clustering?
2) Are kernel maintainers interested in clustering extensions to Linux 
kernel? Do they see any value in them? (Our code does not require kernel 
changes, but we are willing to submit it for inclusion if there is 
interest.)
Please CC me and the list when replying.
