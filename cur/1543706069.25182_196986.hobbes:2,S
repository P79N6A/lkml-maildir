But you have same vulnerability, crypto does not help here. If your
i-node happens to be put on other place, attacker still gets the key
intact etc.
There's not much you can do. [It may be even worse with that
crypto... If you kick the table while your top-secret .mpg.tgz collection
is accessed, you are likely to cause bad sector within i-node,
attacker can get the key, and decrypt it all. With on-place
overwriting he only gets one block.]
