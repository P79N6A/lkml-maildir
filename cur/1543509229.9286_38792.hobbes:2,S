The big ones here are the new config files. They are now consistent about
EXPERIMENTAL. Driver authors please check if you think the tagging is 
right. Its now consistent, but the old values were not so at times David
has guessed which of the several counterclaims you meant. 
Also the MODULE_PARM change should clean up __setup stuff for many people.
Some drivers have MODULE_PARM inside ifdef MODULE at do not want it now,
some vice versa.
