   Also skb_release_data(), ___pskb_trim() and __pskb_pull_tail().  Can these
   ever perform the final release against a page which is on the LRU?
   In interrupt context?
These page releases run from either user or softint context.
They must never run from HW irqs, in fact there is a BUG()
check there against this.
Any page that can be found in the page cache can end up here.  So
whatever that mean for "release against a page which is on the LRU"
applies here.
