Hmm how about when the machine really is in trouble, we really wouldn't 
want some things to be running when we want the watchdog to trigger. How 
do you propose we handle this? nmi_watchdog_tick is pretty light so it has 
a lesser chance of blowing up in various code when the machine is on the 
brink of death.
150,000? Nice Corey, again i stand corrected on that front.
