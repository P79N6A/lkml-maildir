Hello All,
I have 9 disks raid 1. I pulled out 4 disks, and using raidhotadd I
triggered a rebuild on 3 of them. While rebuilding md1, the rebuilding
process is stuck at 0.0%. Below is a snapshot of "/proc/mdstat". 
-----
md1 : active raid1 sdi2[12] sdh2[11] sdg2[10] sde2[4] sdd2[1] sdc2[0]
sdb2[2] sda2[5]
      405504 blocks [9/5] [UUU_UU___]
      [>....................]  recovery =  0.0% (384/405504)
finish=176649.2min speed=0K/sec
-----
The finish="***" time is increasing constantly.
(1) What may be the cause. I have experienced it several times. There is
no heavy IO going-on on any of the partitions. Machine is kind of idle.
(2) Can we somehow stop the rebuilding process and restart it again?
(3) Rebooting will fix it. But I am trying to find a better solution.
Any help is highly appreciated.
Thanking You
Shesha
