- buffer_io_error() is called from interrupt context, and
  kobject_uevent() does multiple GFP_KERNEL allocations.  You'll need to
  use kobject_uevent_atomic().
- the prink_ratelimit() fix in end_buffer_async_read() should be a
  separate patch, really.  I'll fix that up.
- there are numerous other places where an I/O error can be detected:
  grep the tree for b_end_io and bio_end_io.
