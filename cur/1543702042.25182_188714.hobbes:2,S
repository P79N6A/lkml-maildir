 so, I append two traces from "tcpdump -i eth1 multicast". "good" is
from the 2.4.20.-18.7smp kernel, "bad" is from 2.4.22.
 What is interesting from a first look is the fact that the 2.4.22
kernel seems to drop/miss packets from outside that go to a
nonpriviledged port on the multicast group. Ganglia uses port 8649. In
the "bad" case, packets for "239.2.11.71.8649" only come from the local
box. Does this ring any bells for "tg3" or the networking code?
Cheers
Martin
