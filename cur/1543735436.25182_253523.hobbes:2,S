In my experience the realtek binary driver is crap - it brings up the card 
and transfers data correctly - but stops communication after some period of time, 
sometimes 10 minutes, sometimes 1 hour.
It oopses on card removal, doenst handle anything other than normal 
operation for more than 1 hour.
On RH's 2.4.20-8, all of that.
