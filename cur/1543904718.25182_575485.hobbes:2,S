I don't really understand the reasons for all those discussions.
As long as you have a maintainer, why don't you just put swap prefetch into 
the kernel, marked experimental, default deactivated so anyone who just 
make[s] oldconfig (or defaultconfig) won't get it. If anyone finds a good 
solution for all those cache 'poisoning' problems and problems concerning 
swapin on workload changes and such swap prefetch can easily taken out again 
and no one has to complain and continuing maintaining it.
Actually the same goes for plugshed (having it might have kept Con as a 
valuable developer).
I am actually waiting for more than 2 years that reiser4 will make it into the 
kernel (sure, marked experimental or even highly experimental) so the 
patch-journey for every new kernel comes to an end. And most things in-kernel 
will surely be tested more intense so bugs will come up much faster. 
(Constantly running MM kernels is not really an option since many things in 
there can't be deactivated if they don't work as expected since lots of 
patches also concern 'vital' parts of the kernel.)
...just 2cents from a happy CK user for it made it possible to watch a movie 
while compiling the system - which was impossible with mainline kernel, even 
on dual core 2.2 GHz AMD64 with 4G RAM !
