Hi,
after the cleanup in the drivers directory I got some problems.
I use the linux-2.4.0-test6.tar as basis and patched the test7-pre7 file
against it.
1. The media and input dir were located in the /LinuxSource/ dir. I needed to
move it to the /LinuxSource/drivers dir so I could compile xconfig.
2. now I get the following error on compiling: 
ld: cannot open drivers/media/media.o: file or directory not found
this is logical, as I didn't compiled any of the video or radio drivers.
I tried this two times in case the patch kicked me, but the same result.
Could you please give me a hint, where to lock to change this behaviour? So
that the media.o file isn't necessary in my case and I can compile?
cheers
Hartmut
PS: Didn't anybody else got this error? I am a little bit confuse, cause I used
only standard tools, so nothing could get broken while I did moving,
patching and extracting.
