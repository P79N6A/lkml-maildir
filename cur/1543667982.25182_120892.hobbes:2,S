Let me state clearly that I don't have any problems with money being
made off free software.  I also understand the importance of Linux
vendors.
That being said the reason not to leverage their work is that the
reality of capitalism implies an imperative on the vendor to make
decisions which make 'their' kernel more appealing from a marketing
perspective.  Unfortunately the history of the software industry has
pretty effectively demonstrated that making software appealing from a
marketing perspective is at direct odds to producing a quality
product.
I personally have seen too many cases of vendor kernels exploding or
having problems in environments where I run stock statically compiled
kernels without problems.  That isn't meant as an indictment but an
observational fact.
I think the strategy of having a 'hot-list' of security or critical
performance patches for the current release kernel makes the most
amount of sense.  Those people that are comfortable with rolling their
own kernels can grab the patches and have at it.  The presence of
those patches shouldn't affect the steady progression of maintenance
on the 'stable' kernel.
