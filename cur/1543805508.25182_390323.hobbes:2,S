Yes, and even SCHED_OTHER in Linux attempts to do this as part of
the principle of least surprise. That it doesn't _exactly_ match
what you want it to do just means you need to be using something
else.

No I don't think so. POSIX 1.b where sched_yield is defined are the
realtime extensions, are they not?
sched_yield explicitly makes reference to the realtime priority system
of thread lists does it not? It is pretty clear that it is used for
realtime processes to deterministically give up their timeslices to
others of the same priority level.
Linux's SCHED_OTHER behaviour is arguably the best interpretation,
considering SCHED_OTHER is defined to have a single priority level.

It yields to all other SCHED_OTHER processes (which are all on the
same thread priority list) and not to any other processes of higher
realtime priority.

It so happens that processes and threads use the same scheduling
policy in Linux. Is that forbidden somewhere?
