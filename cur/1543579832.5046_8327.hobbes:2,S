I don't believe the problem is data corruption, but that there could be
some CRC data residual from an I/O which causes the driver to issue a
SCSI bus reset.  As bus resets really kill performance, Doug thought it
better to slow the drive to 80 rather than run at 160 and have occasional
bus resets.
