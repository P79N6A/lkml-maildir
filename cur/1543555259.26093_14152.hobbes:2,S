Believe it or not, but this is intentional. In that regard, the
function name is a misnomer -- call it i/o scheduler instead :-)
The current settings in test11 cause this behaviour, because the
starting request sequence numbers are a 'bit' too high.
I'd be very interested if you could repeat your test with my
block patch applied. It has, among other things, a more fair (and
faster) insertion.

READs do have bigger priority, they start out with lower sequence
numbers than WRITEs do:
	latency = elevator_request_latency(elevator, rw);
With my patch, READ sequence start is now 8192. WRITEs are twice
that.
