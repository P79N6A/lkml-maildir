I still think this is actually a bad decision. You can develop them in
kernel providing you put
	if(!capable(CAP_SYS_RAWIO))
		return -EPERM
in the client side open for these devices. At that point root can use it
happily but nobody else can. You can test it, you can share it upstream
and you can motivate people to fix it.
