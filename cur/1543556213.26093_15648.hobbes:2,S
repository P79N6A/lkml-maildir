The IBM implementations of the Java language use native threads --
the result is that every time you do a Java thread creation, you
end up with a new cloned process.  Now this should be pretty fast,
so I am surprised that it stalls like that.  It is possible this
is a scheduler effect.  Do you have a program example you can
share with us?
Also, it is a little old now (by Internet standards) but you 
might take a look at this paper we did at the beginning of 
the year:

We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
