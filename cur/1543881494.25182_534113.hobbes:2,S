Has somthing related with PTY's changed in this kernel ?
I have to enable legacy PTY handling in a couple boxes to get ssh working.
If not, I had openpty() errors and nor sshd nor virtual terminals (aterm) were
able to get a terminal.
User space (udev) is the same in three boxes and one works and two fail.
I had /dev/ptmx everywhere and /dev/pts mounted
Any idea ?
TIA
