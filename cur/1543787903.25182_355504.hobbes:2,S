Subject: [PATCH] ppc64: Crash in DLPAR code on PCI hotplug add
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

08-hotplug-bugfix.patch
In the current 2.6.14-rc2-git6 kernel, performing a Dynamic LPAR Add 
of a hotplug slot will crash the system, with the following (abbreviated) 
stack trace:
cpu 0x3: Vector: 700 (Program Check) at [c000000053dff7f0]
    pc: c0000000004f5974: .__alloc_bootmem+0x0/0xb0
    lr: c0000000000258a0: .update_dn_pci_info+0x108/0x118
        c0000000000257c8 .update_dn_pci_info+0x30/0x118 (unreliable)
        c0000000000258fc .pci_dn_reconfig_notifier+0x4c/0x64
        c000000000060754 .notifier_call_chain+0x68/0x9c
The root cause was that the phb was not marked "dynamic", and so instead
of having kmalloc() being called, the __init __alloc_bootmem() was called,
resulting in access of garage data.  The patch below fixes this crash,
and adds some docs to clarify the code.
