If your APIC works, your CPUs should get the timer IRQs in alternating order.
At least that is what seems to happen on the SMP box where I created and
tested this patch. It works perfectly there.
In the more general case, you may need to do more, right.
You could make the xtime global again and send IPIs for every timer
interrupt to make all CPUs update their TSC offset.
Storing the full 64bit TSC may be a good option though.
So, if people wanted to have this included I'd rather document the
limitations (don't bind the timer IRQ to one CPU) than introducing
complexity which may hurt the normal SMP user.
