Well, testing for bisectability requires compiling each patch as its
applied, which gets painful for something like this where any change
will rebuild the world.  And dealing with patch conflicts caused by
changing early patches in the series is never fun.
But I'm refactoring the series into smaller pieces now.  Knowing what
the outcome should look like, and there the pitfalls are, makes it
fairly easy.
