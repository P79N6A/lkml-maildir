Check out:  
http://bugs.debian.org/85478
  "When klogd's LogLine() function encounters a null byte in state
   PARSING_TEXT, it will loop infinitely.  More precisely, copyin()
   will treat the null byte as a delimiter - unlike LogLine(), which
   will invoke copyin() ever and ever again."
Kinda off-topic, but I just wanted to prove that the bug was in klogd and
not the kernel. :)
