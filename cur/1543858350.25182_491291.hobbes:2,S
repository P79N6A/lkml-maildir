I believe you are correct.  At least the memory hotplug code for powerpc
is currently broken (caused crash!).

Well that is the root of the problem for powerpc.  I believe that
__meminit attribute on memmap_init_zone() has no definition if
CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG is defined.  This is so that it can be called
after boot.  But, this also implies that memmap_init_zone() can not
call any routines in the __init section.

Thanks for the debug work!  Just curious if you really need
CONFIG_NODES_SPAN_OTHER_NODES defined for your platform?  Can you get
those types of memory layouts?  If not, an easy/immediate fix for you
might be to simply turn off the option.

I know you don't recommend this as a fix, but it has the interesting
quality of doing exactly what we want for powerpc.  When
slab_is_available() we are performing a 'memory add' operation
and there is no need to do the 'pfn_in_nid' check.  We know that
the range of added pages will all be on the same (passed) nid.
