hi,
I'm trying to port a ethernet device from 2.2 to 2.4. whith the new way of
dealing with dev->tbusy and dev->start (e.g. by using netif_startqueue for
example) I've understand that the netif_start_queue call put a flag that
telling
the device isn't busy but I can't found when does the start flag is set .
I've read somewhere that it is set when the open function return, but I
haven't
found where is the matching code.
In 2.4, must we always check if the device is busy or started, or it is
upper
layer work ?
Thanks
nb : Is somebody have buy the Linux Device driver book 2nd edition ? and
does it
deal about porting 2.2 to 2.4 driver ?
