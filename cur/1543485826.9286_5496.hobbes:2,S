the absolute minimum is
	- a boot loader (LOADLIN.EXE if you have a DOS handy, LILO else)
	- a binary that can install LILO if necessary
	- the kernel itself
	- a shell that integrates most of the standard commands, like kiss
	  (ls, cp, mv, rm, etc. are all in the shell - no other bins needed)
Thats it. start Linux with the loader and kernel parameter "init=/bin/kiss"
(or wherever you have the shell) and there you are. Single machine, single
console, single shell, single everything (well, almost.)
