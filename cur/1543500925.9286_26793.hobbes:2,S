If you itching to write a DSP module for the kernel that would be
awesome.  It won't affect support for Lucent (and other) Winmodem, which
have an onboard DSP, but PCTel modems and other brands come with only
a hardware codec.
Programming a Lucent winmodem DSP should be interesting; it has its own
RISCish instruction set, its own assembler, etc.  I looked into this in
depth, but stopped after being able to obtain the binary encoding of the
instructions (and too slack to reverse engineer it :))
As a side note, there is a mailing list for discussing winmodem-on-linux
support, subscribe at discuss-subscribe@linmodems.org.
One guy on the list is developing something interesting: "WinSand".  It
is software which runs a Windows device driver in a sandbox environment
under Linux.
