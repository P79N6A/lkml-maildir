Hi, all,
 I got about 30 warning msgs like this during the process of "make
bzImage",   is it a fatal problem or not?
  "Warning: using '%eax' instead of '%ax' due to "l" suffix"
 2. after 'make bzImage', if I don't have any module to install, then I
don't need  to run either 'make modules' or 'make modules_install',
is this correct?
3. After I run the /sbin/lilo, it says the new kernel is added to the
system. HOwever when I restart the system and go into the labeled kernel
I choose, the system gets stucked after these two lines:
Loading kernel.......................
Uncompressing Linux...OK, booting the kernel.
Can you give me some advice on this. Thanks a lot for your kind reply..
Jie
