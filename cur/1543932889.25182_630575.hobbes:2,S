and this one was without the nvidia module:

and the first one I reported, was without nvidia and not-tainted too:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119776365425514&w=2
I am not a complete idiot. If I have a problem, I try to reproduce without 
nvidia first (after a clean shutdown and boot, with the module not even on 
harddisk). And I reproduced it without the module. The last oops with the 
module was just an example that it does not matter if the module is loaded or 
not and to (maybe) give some additional information.
Glück Auf,
Volker
