X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/7/5/153

So, is anybody doing this thing from the subject? 
I'm asking becuse I'm interested in developing it.
Is there any other way to find about work in progress drivers/not in
stable of development kernels (like a different mailing list/or maybe
even some search engine)?
