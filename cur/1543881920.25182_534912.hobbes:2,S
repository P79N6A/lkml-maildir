Hi!
_Can we get a suspend-to-RAM maintainer_?
Noone cares about s2ram these days. I do care a little, seife
maintains whitelist, you care for mac mini, Len/Andrew/Intel acpi team
helps sometimes... But I feel we should have someone listed in the
MAINTAINERS file. Patrick was close, but...

I agree that APM STR worked better than current ACPI STR. I think
swsusp already works better than APM STD, but...

Can I get you on IRC somewhere? No, I do not think I'm a moron, and
yes, I need to suspend^Wsnapshot the devices before, so I have that in
the snapshot. Of course, I'll need to resume^Wrestore the devices
before writing snapshot. That's okay, it does not take long.

Exactly. I need to turn devices *off* before restoring image, and I
need them *off* before saving image, too -- DMAs are dangerous.
I currently do that using "suspend" and "resume" hooks, before they
turn DMAs / IRQs off as a sideeffect.

Well, "startup" function or how you want to call it has to deal with
device not initialized (s2disk driver is module, s2ram with hw powered
off) and has to deal with device initialized (s2disk driver in kernel
case, s2ram device was powered). 
I fear that "resume"/"restore" functions need to be pretty robust,
anyway...

Ok, yes, it is confused/confusing.

snapshot/restore sounds okay to me.
