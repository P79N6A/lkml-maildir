I am refering to this bug:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4569
A thread led to a patch from Paulo:
http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/1/message/59454/flat
This patch has been included in the kernel 2.6.12.
1. How can I easily check if the patch is planned for include in the 2.4?
2. I downloaded the full 2.4.31 source code. The patch appears not to be 
included. Where/Who should I signal that?
