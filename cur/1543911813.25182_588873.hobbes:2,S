Hi Andrew,
Here is the updated version of the Text Edit Lock for 2.6.23-rc3-mm1. It
provides architecture agnostic synchronization for code patching and deals with
i386/x86_64 modification of RO pages by clearing the WP bit around memory
writes.
It is useful for alternatives, paravirt, kprobes and, eventually, immediate
values.
Mathieu
