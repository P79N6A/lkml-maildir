Hello
RAID-1 and RAID-5 are disable on stock kernels.  You need patches from 
 
ftp://ftp.fi.kernel.org/pub/linux/daemons/raid/alpha.
 
The HOWTO can be found at
  
http://ostenfeld.dk/~jakob/Software-RAID.HOWTO/
By the way, the latest kernel for which it works is 2.2.7.  From 2.2.8 on
the array will not sync.  I think it is something related to the
scheduling changes in 2.2.8.
Um abraço,
Enéas
