Subject: [RFC/PATCH 0/2] fsnotify/inotify split
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The following two patches simply split fsnotify from inotify.
There should be no functional change to inotify at all.  Perhaps the
split will help identify the interface bits that can easily converge
for inotify and audit.  They're completely untested...  I started with
inotify-45 in 2.6.13-rc2-mm1, and worked against base 2.6.13-rc2.
My first pass was trivial split, this is my second pass which moves
dnotify and inotify functionality out of fsnotify.h into their respective
corners.  I'm sure audit can at least use the hooks, and perhaps more
base inode watch functionality could be shared (at no cost to you! ;-)
moving forward.
thanks,
