[Resending to Andrew and LKML]
All,
	In developing the ia64-cyclone patch, which implements a cyclone based
time interpolator, I found the following bug which could cause time
inconsistencies. 
In update_wall_time_one_tick(), which is called each timer interrupt, we
call time_interpolator_update(delta_nsec) where delta_nsec is
approximately NSEC_PER_SEC/HZ. This directly correlates with the changes
to xtime which occurs in update_wall_time_one_tick().
However in update_wall_time(), on a second overflow, we again call
time_interpolator_update(NSEC_PER_SEC). However while the components of
xtime are being changed, the overall value of xtime does not (nsec is
decremented NSEC_PER_SEC and sec is incremented).  Thus this call to
time_interpolator_update is incorrect.
This patch removes the incorrect call to time_interpolator_update and
was found to resolve the time inconsistencies I had seen while
developing the ia64-cyclone patch.
Please consider for inclusion.
