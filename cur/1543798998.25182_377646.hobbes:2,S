That's also a very valid argument for keeping the number of different
locking mechanisms down to a small number.

However, the argument _against_ making things generic is that they
become less optimised for specific architectures.  I'm still not
convinced that the genirq stuff is as optimal for ARM as the existing
code is, so I've little motivation to move to the genirq stuff.
(Though I will try to make things easier for those who would like to.)
The same argument applies to attempts to make atomic ops generic using
cmpxchg as a basis for that (as demonstrated on "that other list"), and
the fast path of semaphores.
On "that other list", we're debating saving between 9 and 13 CPU
cycles as an argument in favour of mutexes.  Such a gain which could
very probably be wiped out by any attempt to make them "generic".
