sysklogd 1.3-31 no longer compiles using the latest headers in test11.
Strictly speaking this isn't a kernel bug...
sysklogd's ksym_mod.c includes <linux/module.h>
In test11, <linux/module.h> added struct inter_module_entry.  Its
first member is "struct list_head list;".  This necessitates the
inclusion of <linux/list.h>.
The trouble is that <linux/list.h> is almost completely protected by
#ifdef __KERNEL__.
sysklogd, obviously, doesn't compile with __KERNEL__ so the struct
inter_module_entry declaration is impossible and the compilation
fails.
It's not clear to me who's code needs changing so I'm sending both to
linux-kernel and to some of the people that have the misfortune of
being listed on the sysklogd man page.
