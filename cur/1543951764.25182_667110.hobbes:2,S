I experience random repeats during heavy loads  such as yum upgrade, 
which triggers a huge swapout, in Fedora Core 7 with Fedora's 
2.6.23.14-64 on amd64, Xorg 1.3... Using USB keyboard.
I'm not sure if it's the same issue or not, they don't repeat "forever" 
for me, it just makes my speeellllliingggg   llllooookkk   
teerrriibbblle. Like that. Before this happens, letters usually stop 
appearing on screen as I'm typing. I usually stop typing at that point, 
since I know it will just become a mess.
I haven't encountered "forever"-stuck keys since about Fedora Core 5, I 
don't remember kernel and X versions there, but I was using a PS/2 
keyboard, and almost always it was something like ctrl-right that 
stuck, which meant that the computer ended up switching virtual 
desktops as fast as it could. Recovery involved bashing on keyboard, 
trying ctrl-alt-backspace, ctrl-alt-f1 and so on until something 
worked. It took many minutes to clear up, with everything trying to 
redraw their windows a few hojillion times. 
I hope this doesn't come back, I can cope with the bad spelling ;-)
