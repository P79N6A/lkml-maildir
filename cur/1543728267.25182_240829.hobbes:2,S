I sent this patch to the jackit-devel list, and everyone seems to think
this would be a useful feature; had this been around a few years ago it
certainly would have aided JACK's development.  Debugging an RT process
becomes as easy as a regular one (read: reboot free).  I see no reason
not to merge it once it has been widely tested.
