I firmly believe that the average driver person is not going
to be able to get these things right, even if you document it
in big bold letters in some Documentation/*.txt file.
This is like the Alpha OSF outb() interface for kernel drivers
that had something like 8 arguments.
And even if you define these things, and people start using it,
only PowerPC and a few other systems (I guess IA64) will ever
notice when this stuff is done wrong.  That's really not a good
plan from a testing coverage point of view.
