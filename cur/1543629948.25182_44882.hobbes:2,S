Hi,
I am running 2.4.19-pre7-ac4 , Mandrake 8.1 and
noticed  strange thing ..
  If I logout from Xsesion, I can not see any vc ; no
command line, etc...; all I have is a blank screen.
Try tp type a command like  sudo  halt  to turn off
the computer, no response. But can use Ctrl + Alt +
Del to cleanly reboot the machine
What is the cause? thanks for your time
