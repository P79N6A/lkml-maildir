I managed to crash my machine just now, and it seems to be caught
in a loop:
do_page_fault+0x00 
do_page_fault+0x1e
error_code+0x20
do_page_fault+0x00 
do_page_fault+0x1e
error_code+0x20
do_page_fault+0x00 
do_page_fault+0x1e
error_code+0x20
eventually causing a stack overflow. 
This sounds to me as if it is getting a page fault while handling a
page fault. It seems to happen from an interrupt handler that I wrote,
but I'd guess that the loop (which makes my debug info scroll off the
screen) is a problem outside of my code. 
(Sure I'm triggering it, but then it shouldn't go "wild" and
recursively call itself.....)
