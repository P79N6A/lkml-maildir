The main thing I would really like to preserve is the
space used for "near-NULL" pointer detection. That is,
detection of trying to access a large index in a NULL
pointer array, etc.
I'd be happy to have some arbitrary value for the lower
boundary...

Good point, though a 64 bit architecture is, umm, less
likely to run all the way down to zero within our lifetime.
