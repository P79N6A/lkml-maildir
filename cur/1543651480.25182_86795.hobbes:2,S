Hi,
  when floppy driver changes in 2.3.99 happened, I was told that
if /dev/fd0 is opened with O_EXCL | O_SYNC, read()/write() after
disk change will fail with error, and so app is notified about change.
But today it was pointed to me that this does not work anymore: both
2.4.19 and 2.5.45 do not report disk change when used this way (2.4.5
does). When I use O_EXCL | O_NDELAY, I can detect that disk change 
happened since last close, but subsequent disk changes are not reported 
to the app, so it is unusable too...
I stared at floppy.c code (in 2.5.45) for an hour, but I cannot find what's
proper way to do that: after disk change I need that read or write fails
(preferred) or that I can call some ioctl() before read/write and this
ioctl will tell me that disk change happened (I did not found such call,
sorry).
                                     Thanks,
                                            Petr Vandrovec
