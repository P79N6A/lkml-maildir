That is still buggy.  We MUST NOT invalidate the inode buffers unless
i_nlink == 0, because otherwise a subsequent open() and fsync() will
have forgotten what buffers are dirty, and hence will fail to
synchronise properly with the disk.
Al, I agreed with your observation on bforget() needing the
remove_inode_queue() call.  Is there anywhere else we need it?
