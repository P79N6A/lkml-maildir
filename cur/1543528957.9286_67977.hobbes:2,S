If it originated at UCB, and no one else added any further restrictions,
then you can.  If someone else wrote it, and used the BSD license, then
no, you can't.  Slapping the GPL on it could easily be taken as a rather
rude thing to do, however.

The authors of the software need to make a new release with the modified
license.  The Regents of the University of California at Berkely have
already done so (or at least "virtually" made a new release).  I don't
think all of the bsd-games package originated at UC Berkely though.
