Ok.  I've been playing with this some.  Basically when we pick up the
new process to schedule it has a 0 rsp.  Dumping out the comm and flags
both reveal 0's throughout.  I tried another run poisoning the flags
field when freeing a task but the flags remain 0.
Anyone got any good ideas for patches to blame?
