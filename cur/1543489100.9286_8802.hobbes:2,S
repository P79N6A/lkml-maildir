I just installed redhat 5.2 on an 80MB HP Omnibook 800CT, and all
installed well, except that when I rebooted, the kernel only saw 64MB of
memory.
I was told this was a bug after enquiring about the /etc/lilo.conf "mem"
keyword. 2.0.36 and 2.2.x kernels should, apparrently, detect all
available memory without resorting to options in the lilo.conf file.
I am in the process of installing 2.2.2, so this problem might be a moot
case for me in future (I'll send another email if I have the same problem
with 2.2.2).
Regards,
Tor Houghton.
