Yes, if the block allocation is needed, my patch is basically
no-op, we go through regular code.

I don't see how we do this today. Yes. Metadata updates are jounalled,
but I don't see how current adding buffers through journal_dirty_data
(bh) call can guarantee that these buffers get added to metadata-update
transaction ?

BTW, thanks Ted for putting this in human-readable terms :)
