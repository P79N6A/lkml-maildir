You cannot remove inline from there. For some unknown reason even
if you'll mark it as 'static', gcc3 will still emit this code into object
file. You have to change constraint from "+d" to "+r" (with
changing %edx => %0 and adding push %edx around call to rwsemwake), or
just rewrite it in the way __up_write operates (movl %2,%%edx, add
"edx" into clobbered and %2 as value assigned to tmp, patch sent last week).

Pre-26th snapshots have some fatal bug in optimizing 
if (x) a = 123; else a = 456; :-( Look back through linux-kernel archive.
