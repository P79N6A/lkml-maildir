Defaults cannot override the user values from .config and in most 2.4 
.configs CONFIG_INPUT is disabled, so that you cannot change CONFIG_VT 
with 'make oldconfig', as it depends now on CONFIG_INPUT.
To override the old CONFIG_INPUT value you either have to disable the 
input prompt somehow or you have to rename the symbol and change 
CONFIG_INPUT into a derived symbol, e.g.:
config INPUT2
	tristate "Input devices (needed for keyboard, mouse, ...)"
	default y
config INPUT
	def_tristate INPUT2
