Dave you touch core of problems .. messages occures constantly but 
high network activity occures only at night on this interface (backup). In 
attachment is weekly graph network acivity measured on SNMP agent on 
switch on this port.
At day usualaly on this interface activity is is very low (5-40Kb/s 
in/out).

Good news. After switch to kernel 2.6.13-1.1552sp1 from corona with your 
patch I don't see "svc: .." messages, but "eth0: Happy Meal .." still 
occures (seems less but still).
After ~half of day (and pass one time backup at night):
[root@boss ~]# grep "^Sep 14" /var/log/kernel | grep kernel: | uniq | cut -d " " -f 6- | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 3
       2 udp v4 hw csum failure.
      15 eth0: Happy Meal out of receive descriptors, packet dropped.
      22 hw tcp v4 csum failed
[root@boss ~]# LANG= date

I'll try count of this for compare again at ~12:00 pm.
