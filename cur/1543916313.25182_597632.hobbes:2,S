Because having a magic early version is a bad burden to place on
programmers.  It's an admission of failure that we cannot create a
simpler interface.
AFAICT it's a handful of bytes which would be freed.

Again, I don't think calling kmalloc in NMI is valid.  Unless I'm
missing something, any code which uses locks is susceptible to deadlock
if used from an NMI handler.   So you really can't do much.
It's nice that you have the perfect solution.  But I'd really rather see
a sufficient solution which is 1/4 of the code and 1/10 the complexity.
