Subject: cleaning up "make headers_install" for various architectures

  there are a number of architectures that generate warnings (and, in
one case, an error) if you try to do:
  $ make ARCH=whatever headers_install
when you don't have an appropriate cross-compiler installed.  this
doesn't seem to make sense as you shouldn't have to do any actual
cross-compiling if you're just trying to install headers, should you?
  the examples (i already mentioned the ia64 example on that list):
$ make ARCH=m68k headers_install
make: m68k-linux-gnu-gcc: Command not found
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  HOSTCC  scripts/unifdef
  MKDIR   include
  ... etc etc ...
$ make ARCH=h8300 headers_install
make: h8300-elf-gcc: Command not found
make: h8300-elf-gcc: Command not found
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
make[1]: `scripts/unifdef' is up to date.
  UNIFDEF include/asm/page.h
  ... etc etc ...
$ make ARCH=sparc64 headers_install
/bin/sh: sparc64-linux-gcc: command not found
make: sparc64-linux-gcc: Command not found
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
make[1]: `scripts/unifdef' is up to date.
  MKDIR   include/asm-sparc64
  ... etc etc ...
$ make ARCH=ia64 headers_install
/home/rpjday/k/git/arch/ia64/scripts/check-segrel.S: Assembler messages:
/home/rpjday/k/git/arch/ia64/scripts/check-segrel.S:1: Error: unknown pseudo-op: `.rodata'

objdump: '/tmp/out3703': No such file/home/rpjday/k/git/arch/ia64/scripts/toolchain-flags: line 19: [: !=:

  the final example, parisc, just plain fails:
$ make ARCH=parisc headers_install
/home/rpjday/k/git/scripts/gcc-version.sh: line 16: hppa-linux-gcc: command not found
/home/rpjday/k/git/scripts/gcc-version.sh: line 17: hppa-linux-gcc: command not found
/home/rpjday/k/git/arch/parisc/Makefile:39: *** Sorry, GCC v3.3 or above is required..  Stop.
