Which zaps the .config, last time I tried it.  (Just tried it again and yup, 
it zapped it.)
Interestingly, I forgot that make install doesn't install modules (for that 
you need make modules_install), but it DOES try to re-index them (resulting 
in some complaints about the modules for the smp kernel I'd accidentally 
compiled earlier having unresolved symbols in them).  I misinterpreted this 
as it complaining that the *.ko files in the build tree hadn't been updated, 
and did a "find . -name '*.ko' | xargs rm", and at that point the build 
process's dependencies got confused enough I just did a make clean and 
started over...
Don't mind me, I'm having fun...
