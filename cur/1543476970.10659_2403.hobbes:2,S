    GAK!!!  Security flaw here, methinks.  chown should unconditionally clear 
    setuid and setgid.
Well, there is the system call and the utility.
About the system call:
	POSIX.1 (5.6.5.2) paraphrased: suid and sgid bits shall be cleared
		unless the chown was invoked by root, in which case it is
		implementation dependent whether these bits are cleared or not.
(Single Unix Spec says the same.)
About the utility: it should do what the call does.
So, yes you may be right about the security. Both behaviours are allowed
by the standards.

         We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
