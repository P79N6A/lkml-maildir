I didn't complained yet but the whole point of the BUG() was to get such
a printk in the right place. Now the above report is trivial and the
debugging check triggered a false positive bugcheck due
CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM=y (I always compile with =n and that's why I didn't
triggered it here), but sometime it isn't that easy to find it out, in
particular when there are plenty of BUG()s in a row like in
page_alloc.c, so I disagree with the merger of the out_of_line_bug in
mainline.
I will the false positive bugcheck it in next -aa, for now you can
simply recompile the kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM=n (kernel hacking
menu) and you'll be just fine.
thanks for the feedback Andrey,
Andrea
