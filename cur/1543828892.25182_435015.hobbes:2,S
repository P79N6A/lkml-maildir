Sorry, can't help with that.
You should try:
        echo 'scsi remove-single-device 0 1 2 3' >/proc/scsi/scsi
where you replace the example numbers with:
        0 = host adapter number
        1 = host channel number
        2 = device SCSI id
        3 = device lun
before removing the device.  Then do:
        echo 'scsi add-single-device 0 1 2 3' >/proc/scsi/scsi
after putting it back.
To see your host adapter numbers, do:
        cat /proc/scsi/scsi

Try posting this separately to netdev@vger.kernel.org.  I don't think it
should happen.
