I'm trying to put this system-call auditing to use, and I'm running into 
some trouble figuring it out. I've been studying the sources for the 
auditd example app and the audit.c/auditsc.c kernel files, and have yet 
to figure out how to accomplish my goal.
What I am trying to do is detect when a modified file is closed. I 
figured auditing __NR_open, __NR_write, and __NR_close would be the way 
to do this (perhaps I am wrong here?). My problem is that I haven't 
found a way to tie the open/write/close calls together with the info 
that the auditing code provides.
The audit info for __NR_open provides the filename (which I would need 
when my app goes to work) but doesn't provide any unique identifier that 
I can use to tie it to audits on __NR_write or __NR_close.
If anyone can give me some pointers on how to use this auditing code I 
would greatly appreciate it.
