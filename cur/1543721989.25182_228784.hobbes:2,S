Here we go.
Addendum: After some time more and more konsole froze. Up to the point
where i (had to) kill(ed) X(CTRL-ALT-Backspace) and after i couldn't
even log in at the console anymore i rebooted (into 2.6.5). Then i
recompiled 2.6.7 with SYSRQ-support and tried to reproduce the hanging
without X. After 3 runs i "gave up" and started X. Here i had luck and
the process ('cut-movie.pl') froze at first try. Then i killed X and did
the above on the console.
As the system is currently unsuable enough to reboot, i will reboot in
2.6.5 after this mail, but i can always reboot into 2.6.7 if you need
more input.
