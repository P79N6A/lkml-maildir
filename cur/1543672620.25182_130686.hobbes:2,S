           Summary: laptop internal pointer and usb external mouse both
                    appear on mouse0
    Kernel Version: 2.5.69
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: vojtech@suse.cz
         Submitter: jvb@prairienet.org
Distribution:  Debian unstable
Hardware Environment:  Toshiba Libretto L5 laptop
Both my laptop's PS/2 internal pointer and an external USB mouse appear on
/dev/input/mouse0.  This contradicts what is stated in input.txt ("each mouse
device is assiged to a single mouse"), and is undesired because I'd like to
configure each device differently in X.
