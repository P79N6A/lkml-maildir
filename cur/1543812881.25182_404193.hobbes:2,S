Hi Russell and folks,
This patch has the following corrections, all regarding the observations 
from Russell on his last e-mail of this thread:
 - In mmc_omap_probe(), was add an if statement in case of ioremap fails 
with NULL.
 - In mmc_omap_xfer_data(), was used __raw_readsw and __raw_writesw for 
a more efficient implementation.
All suggestions and comments are welcome.
BR,
Carlos.
