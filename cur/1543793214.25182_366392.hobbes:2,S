Its a one line bugfix so make the bugfix. There are often drivers that
needed tiny fixes and it turned out that
- Vendors had it in their patch tree for years
- The one person using it fixed it and didnt bother telling l/k cos they
though l/k was full of arrogant assholes who would just laugh at them
- The few users are still on 2.4 but will move to 2.6
Now when its a major rewrite to fix up some prehistoric piece of crap it
makes sense to dump it if nobody uses it, when you have a one line fix
required its a bit daft not to fix it.
