Subject: Can a filesystem use a separate dcache?

The filesystem I am writing might need a separated dcache so that the
dentry of this filesystem objects are maintained in that dentry cache
space.  Is this possible? If possible, where shall I start with? The
workload to setup a separate dcache seems to be very high though. :(
Can someone guide me to the right direction?
Thanks,
Xin
