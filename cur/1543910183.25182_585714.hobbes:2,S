I assume you mean "except for IO-related code and 'random' values like 
jiffies" as you mention later on?  I assume other values set in 
interrupt handlers would count as "random" from a volatility perspective?

What about reading values modified in interrupt handlers, as in your 
"random" case?  Or is this a bug where the user of atomic_read() is 
invalidly expecting a read each time it is called?
