Well ... he did have some nice ideas. Unfortunately, they usually don't  
get palatable until someone else has worked on them.
If you look into Wirth's books and see that the example code in there ...
* uses one(!) space indentation
* routinely puts several statements on one line
* typically uses one- or two-character variable names
... then you realize that *every* Wirth source needs rewriting.

Niklaus Wirth has lamented that, whereas Europeans pronounce his name correctly
(Ni-klows Virt), Americans invariably mangle it into (Nick-les Worth).  Which
is to say that Europeans call him by name, but Americans call him by value.
