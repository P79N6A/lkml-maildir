You're missing my point.  I was not claiming that cdrecord's naming 
scheme was great and I'm still not claiming that.  I was objecting to

maintained it for years, and we've all used it for years.

    The cdrecord naming scheme is broken, we aren't going to support it.
would have been enough.  Maybe Linus has some issues with the author but
