And now you are recreating ATA in SCSI ;-).
Don't get me wrong: I like idea very much, but why you can't
share common code between drivers/ide and your ATA-SCSI.

Its getting close.

I think it is simply wrong, you should use function pointers.
You can have ie. two PCI hosts, one using PIO and one using MMIO.
"measureably faster", I doubt.
IO operations are REALLY slow when compared to CPU cycles.

No big deal here, ATA will get it too.

CPU polling is faster than IRQs?

So fix it ;-).

And right now ugly and incomplete.
IMO, of course ;-).
