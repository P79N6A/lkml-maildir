Well, in the case of this particular driver, I think it's not so much a 
PCMCIA thing as a "network driver" thing. It's not like the driver 
actually needs any extra PCMCIA support or anything like that, and as such 
I think in this case it's really more of a regular network driver than 
anything else.
And especially with wireless, I think the impact for any future changes 
are about the wireless infrastructure, not PCMCIA. There's little reason 
to believe that we'll ever make any big PCMCIA overhauls exctly because 
PCMCIA is so dead.
So I'd happily merge it, but I would be even happier if I got ack's from 
the wireless people or if it was simply merged that way too.
