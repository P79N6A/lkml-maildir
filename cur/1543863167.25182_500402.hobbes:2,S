There are no security fixes for rc and our own experience
is, that RT patch has very low impact on base system stability.
The rc-s contains much more experimental stuff all over the
kernel which needs to be stabilized till next (hopefully) stable
release.

We have run successfully 2.6.16.1-rt12 over last summer
semester on students diskless stations without much problems.
(Main problem has been some NFS FS problem with 1GB/s server, 100MB/s
stations and switches in between, but it has been same for non-RT kernel.
We solved that by switching NFS over TCP.)
We would like to upgrade to something which would not cause us much
troubles for next course run. We teach real time control in X35POS
course and we need fast responses and timing (100 usec) for direct
PWM and IO control.
On the other hand, I agree that for own experimentation and development
it is better to build on latest released version.
Best wishes
