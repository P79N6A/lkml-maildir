           Summary: aty128fb.c fails to compile (logic error)
    Kernel Version: 2.5.63
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: bugme-janitors@lists.osdl.org
         Submitter: donaldlf@i-55.com
Distribution:rawhide
Hardware Environment: LX164/alpha
Software Environment: redhat
Problem Description:
the driver aty128fb.c aka DRI for ATI Rage pro fails to compile
due to logic error in aty128fb_setup there are 3 #define cases each
is for mac, intel , or ppc. there is an 4th case for default purposes.
The logic is constructed so that it's an if else logic tree, find a good
 case short circuit around the rest. The problem is if one of the three
conditions don't apply then there is an else with no if. I restructured
the code so now it uses continues. Same speed fewer indentions and 
it will now compile. 
patch will be include in followup.
Steps to reproduce:
select XFree 4.1 DRI modules.
select an non PPC no Intel hardware
select ATI Rage 128 DRI driver
compile.
