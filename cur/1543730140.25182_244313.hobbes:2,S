Subject: Very slow file read performance in kernel 2.4.26 or 2.6.8.1

Because of slow samba performance I did some testing on file read
performance and discovered that the read performance is very
poor sometimes.
dd if=/dev/hda6 of=/dev/null bs=65536
gives a raw read performance of approx. 41 MB/sec (which is perfectly OK).
Reading a file from the "filesystem", no matter if it is reiserfs or ext3
gives a read transfer rate of max. 25 MB/sec (best case).
I even had cases where a 730 MB file on a reiserfs partition was read
with approx. 3 MB/sec. That is pure horror.
Windows XP/SP2 on a similar system easily reaches 40 MB/sec on that same
730 MB file.
Any ideas? Or is the kernel that slow?
Regards
  Andreas
