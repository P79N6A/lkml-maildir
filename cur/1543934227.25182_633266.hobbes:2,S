Well, I think I still have a bug, though it is possibly a mainline problem and 
it's not a showstopper. After a suspend/resume cycle the reboot does not 
work. The system hangs with "Rebooting system" (or similar). After that you 
have to hard reset the system, which is not really a problem as filesystems 
have been unmounted before. Reboot without a suspend cycle before and halt 
with and without suspend cycle work without problems.
I'm using toi 3.0-rc3 with kernel 2.6.24-rc6 and beside the problem described 
above I'm really happy with toi.
Happy new your to everybody!
