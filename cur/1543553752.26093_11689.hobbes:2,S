hi,
why does this program works. when executed, it doesnt
give a segmentation fault. when the program requests
memory, is a standard chunk is allocated irrespective
of the what the user specifies. please explain.
main()
{
   char *s;
   s = (char*)malloc(0);
   strcpy(s,"fffff");
   printf("%s\n",s);
}
NOTE:
  i know its a 'C' problem. but i wanted to know how
this works
