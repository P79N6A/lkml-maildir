Subject: Bug in 2.2.14 gettimeofday() on i386 (and patch to fix it)

When xntpd (or similar) wants to slow down the system clock, it (effectively)
subtracts from xtime.tv_usecs the amount it wants to slow the clock
down by.  If an application (e.g., squid, XF86, netscape, etc.) then
does a gettimeofday(), the time appears to have gone forward by around 
an hour and a quarter (4294 seconds, to be precise).  A couple of
seconds later, the time appears to go back to what it should have been.
This is because of the way that arch/i386/kernel/time.c works:  it
grabs xtime.tv_usecs, assigns its contents to an unsigned long (thus
converting it to a very large number if it was negative) thn adjusts
the seconds value it'll return by the number of microseconds  it
thinks it has.
Here's a program that detects the problem (although the main effect I
was seeing was that squid kept timing out immediately):
----
#include <time.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <unistd.h>
main()
{
        time_t last;
        time_t t;
        struct timeval tv;
        char buf[128];
        char buf1[128];
        gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);
        last = tv.tv_sec;
        sleep(1);
        for(;;)
        {
                gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);
                t = tv.tv_sec;
                if (t > last + 2 || t < last)
                        printf("%s -> %s (%lu -> %lu)\n",
			                       strcpy(buf, ctime(&last)), 
					       strcpy(buf1, ctime(&t)), 
					       last, t);
                last = t;
                sleep(1);
        }
        return 0;
}

When I ran this with xntpd running, and a slightly fast running clock, 
I saw at about ten-minute intervals, the time apparently leap forwards 
by about one and a quarter hours, then back again after a couple of
seconds. 
Here's a patch that fixes it.  There's a choice here --- I chose to
keep tv_secs from different calls to gettimeofday to be monotonically
increasing.  by zeroing tv_usecs if it would otherwise be negative.
The other alternative would be to correct secs down.
Here's the patch against 2.2.14:
