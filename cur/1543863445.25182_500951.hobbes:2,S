Exactly. This is a classic example of a bidirectional command
and indeed two scatter-gather lists (that are mapped into two
bio lists) are used.

I would say that it might make sense to define an equivalent
for dma_data_direction at the block layer, for example:
enum req_io_direction {
	REQ_IO_NONE = 0,
	REQ_IN_FROM_DEVICE = 1,
	REQ_OUT_TO_DEVICE = 2,
	REQ_BIDIRECTIONAL = 3,
};
can be used in struct request and upper layers.
Besides the fact that having separate I/O buffers for bidirectional
transfers makes block I/O different from pci bidi I/O,
this enum makes more sense "arithmetically" and has
a much better meaning for the zero value.
Today DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL is used in several places as the default and "invalid"
value since no-one ever used it before. I'd rather have the value 0 mean
REQ_IO_NONE (or REQ_IO_INVALID if we want such thing).
