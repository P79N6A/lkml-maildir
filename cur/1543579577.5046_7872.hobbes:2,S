Hi Duncan,
(BTW, it's an STL2 board, not SBT2.  And it's Randy, not Mr. Dunlap. :)
Here's my output from dump_pirq.  Is the PCI router info unique
enough so that you'll need to debug it instead of me doing so?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[root@localhost src]# ./dump_pirq
 
Interrupt routing table found at address 0xfdf10
  Version 1.0, 0 bytes
  Interrupt router is device ff:1f.7
  PCI exclusive interrupt mask: 0x0000 []
 
Interrupt router at ff:1f.7:
Could not read router info from /proc/bus/pci/ff/1f.7.
[root@localhost src]#
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thanks,
~Randy
