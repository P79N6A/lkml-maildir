   Where are interrupts disabled?   I just went through a set of kernprof
   data and traced up the call graph.  In the most common __kfree_skb
   case, I do not believe that it has interupts disabled.  I could be
   wrong, but I didn't see it.

To name a few, interrupts are disabled when skbs are put back to the
hot_list
and when the cache list is accessed in the slab allocator. Am I missing
something? Please help me to understand.
