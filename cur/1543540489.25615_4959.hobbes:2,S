It is already done and works fine.

Agreed, since then the config files would be kernel-version-dependent,
which is nasty for people who flip between kernels.

Something like this seems the best option; either that or (as I think
there is some intent) have a separate mechanism for handling loading
of hot plug PCI drivers that isn't tied with PCMCIA at all.  That
would sidestep the compatibility issue.
Is it legal to have something like this:
    probe 3c575_cb 3c575_cb 3c59x
or would modprobe try to recursively expand the 3c575_cb?

This is unsatisfactory, since on a pre-2.4 system, there may already
be 3c59x modules hanging around that do not support CardBus, and
modprobe is not going to be able to select the right one to use.
