The issue here is that I thought Linus mentioned a change in the ioremap
function, which would require ISA cards to be accessed by
read_ISA_X/write_ISA_X and others by readX/writeX. Since my driver uses
readX/writeX to access _both_ (PCI and ISA), that would mean having to add
the following for every call to this functions:
if (ISA)
    read_ISA_X/write_ISA_X;
else
    readX/writeX;
Interestingly enough, Linus _didn't_ mention anything about changing the
ioremap function (and I have no idea where I got this idea from). Thus, my
e-mail is completely unfounded and can be ignored.
Sorry for the unnecessary noise.
