Without contention, is there still a problem with cache line ping pong
of acquiring a free semaphore?
I mean, say only one task is using a given semaphore. Is there still
going to be cache line transfers for acquiring it? Even if the task in
question stays on a CPU. Is the "LOCK" on an instruction that expensive
even if the other CPUs haven't accessed that location of memory.
Sorry for my ignorance, I don't know all the interworkings of the Cache
on SMP systems.  Is there any good references on the Internet? I
definitely want to know so that my coding practices for SMP improve. 
Thanks,
