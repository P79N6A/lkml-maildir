I've heard/seen Christoph mention passing a nodemask to alloc_pages a
few times, but hadn't seen any of the details.  Got me thinking..

It'll take me a while to absorb the patch, so I'll just ask:  Where does
the zonelist for the argument come from?  If the the bind policy
zonelist is removed, then does it come from a node?  There'll be only
one per node with your other patches, right?  So you had to have a node
id, to look up the zonelist?  Do you need the zonelist elsewhere,
outside of alloc_pages()?  If not, why not just let alloc_pages look it
up from a starting node [which I think can be determined from the
policy]?  
OK, that's a lot of questions.  no need to answer.  That's just what I'm
thinking re: all this.  I'll wait and see how the patch develops.

Again, it'll be a while.
