You need to forget about LRU for a moment. The fact that
LRU is fundamentally broken doesn't mean that it has
anything whatsoever to do with whether we age all pages
fairly or whether we prefer some pages over other pages.
If LRU is broken we need to fix that, a workaround like
your proposal doesn't fix anything in this case.

Rik
