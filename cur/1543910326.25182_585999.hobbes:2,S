Eh?  regex via NFA is O(expression size * string length) time and
O(expression size) space.  If you can show that regex matching is
NP-complete, you've got a good shot at Nevanlinna Prize...
Not that it made regex in kernel a good idea, but fair is fair -
unless you can show any mentioning of backrefs upthread...[1]
