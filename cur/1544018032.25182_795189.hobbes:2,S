There are a few ways to check for 64-bitness that are 
platform-independent, unfortunately each of them have drawbacks.
a) the gcc-specific way:
	#if __SIZEOF_POINTER__ == 8
    or
	#ifdef __LP64__
    or any other number of variants.
    It has the obvious disadvantage of being gcc-specific, although
    it seems rather likely that other Linux-supporting compilers might
    also define these macros.
b) the standard C way:
	#include <limits.h>
	#if LONG_MAX > 2147483647L
    it has the obvious disadvantage of needing to include <limits.h>...
We can, of course, also do our own thing as DaveM suggested; this is 
probably the best option.  FWIW, glibc has _WORDSIZE which is equivalent 
to what we call BITS_PER_LONG.  We might as well export it under that 
name (presumably under #ifndef).
