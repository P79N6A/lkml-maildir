Hi,
Here is the port of the conditional calls to 2.6.22-rc2-mm1.
Quoting my last post:
Following Andi Kleen's advice, I splitted the jump-over-call into a speparate
piece of infrastructure so it can be used more widely.
It also use a hash table to permit cond_call enable/disable both when the
cond_call is armed and when a module containing an armed cond_call is loaded.
Please add at the end of the 2.6.22-rc2-mm1 series,
conditional-calls-architecture-independent-code.patch
conditional-calls-hash-table.patch
conditional-calls-non-optimized-architectures.patch
conditional-calls-kconfig-menus.patch
conditional-calls-i386-optimization.patch
conditional-calls-powerpc-optimization.patch
