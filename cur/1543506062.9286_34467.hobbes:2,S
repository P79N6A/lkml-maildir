Indeed. I missed that.

And this one too. :)

I just ran 'grep jiffies `find . -name "*.c"` on 2.3.13 tree and the
result was 168909 bytes / 2419 lines.
Not all the lines involve jiffies explicitely in arithmetic expressions
but a large part of the lines do. Probably most are correct, but it would
be a nightmare to check all that stuff for a human. 
There were some other proposals in my posting that allow to avoid to deal 
explicitely with jiffies and arithmetic expression involving kernel time 
values. They are pretty simple and trivial macros I will use to make the 
drivers I maintain jiffies-safe (modulo the right type for kernel time 
I missed).
By the way, I didn't propose to incorporate these tiny and trivial stuff 
in the kernel main stream, but just asked if they were acceptable by the 
kernel maintainers if I actually use them.
Thanks a lot for you answer.
Gérard.
