I did "sparse test.c" and got no output whatsoever.  No files were created, either.

I get the same thing:
execve("sparse-bk/check", ["sparse-bk/check", "test.c"], [/* 57 vars */]) = 0
access("/etc/ld.so.preload", R_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY)      = 3
fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=74426, ...}) = 0
open("/lib/tls/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY)    = 3
fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0755, st_size=1359489, ...}) = 0
open("test.c", O_RDONLY)                = 3
open("/usr/include/stdarg.h", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/usr/local/include/stdarg.h", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-suse-linux/3.3.4/include/stdarg.h", O_RDONLY) = 3
There must be something specific about how kbuild calls sparse.
