Subject: [PATCH] 12/18 console_unblank bug fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Problem:  console_unblank can cause an endless trap loop if the console
          semaphore is already taken and console_unblank is called in
          interrupt context.
Solution: To avoid the trap loop just try to take the console semaphore
          with down_trylock and exit if it fails. It is not perfect
          since c->unblank() is not called in this case but way better
          than an endless trap loop. s390/s390x are the only two
          architectures that still use console_unblank. This patch
          has been accepted to 2.5.
