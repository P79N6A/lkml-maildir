I'm not a huge fan of streams, but I'm pretty sure there are various
encryption tools that let us verify and validate the source of data.
It's entirely possible the virus checker wasn't doing it right, but
storing verification info in an EA or stream isn't entirely invalid.
You still need an external key that you do trust of course.
