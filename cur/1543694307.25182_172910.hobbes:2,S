From memory at least x86, alpha, ppc32 and ppc64 worked with Andrey's
irq consolidation patches. I'll be pushing for it in 2.7 together with
some macros to abstract away irq_desc[NR_IRQS] completely. (it will
make it easier to support 24 bit irqs on ppc64 and should allow sparc64
to use the consolidated irq code).
