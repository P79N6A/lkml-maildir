Correct.  But all they need are the ia64 bits of the ELF loader,
plus ia64 specific goo.  The generic part of the ELF loader is already
written.

Sort of fundamentally they are arch dependent.  
I believe that DMA FIXME is a red hearing.  Initially that patch
was targeted for a kernel without device_shutdown(), so I was
likely considering the old trick of running through all of the PCI
devices and disabling their bus master bit.
In general there are two arch specific pieces of information here.
1) What is the kernel's argument passing format, what arguments
   does the kernel need, and how do you derive those arguments
   from a running kernel.
   Usually this is at least the kernels memory map.  But the binary
   arguments a kernel accepts/requires vary widely from architecture
   to architecture. 
(This is user space only)
2) The code itself in machine_kexec.c and relocate_kernel.S needs
   to place the machine in a state where virtual and physical addresses
   are identity mapped.  And the arch specific registers are in some
   well defined state.  Usually the least setup you can guarantee to make
   it work the better.  
(This is the kernel side)
We should probably start capturing these pieces of information in
a kexec.3 man page.  Volunteers?
For ia64 in particular I believe the binary arguments are the
FPSWA and EFI memory map, and the firmware entry points (PAL and SAL
and EFI).
As for the physical mode transition state.  I believe that
is largely defined by the current set of kernel bootloaders.
