You're welcome, you should also thank Dave and Hugh even before you
thank me ;), since they solved many of the problems to make this
possible years ago even before I started working on the objrmap myself.

it's not an oops report, it's a warning only and it should not affect

shutdown the warning so you won't be annoyed anymore by it ;)

maybe a delay generated by the printk, not sure why there's a relation
between the two, or if it's only a coincidence. WARN_ON after triggering
should only generate a delay, no other effects.
thanks!
