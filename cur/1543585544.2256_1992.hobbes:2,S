I have tried this on both a stock Redhat 7.0 kernel and on 2.2.19pre5 with
your serial-5.05 driver, and I could not measure any difference with and
without the "low_latency" parameter to setserial ....
#setserial -a /dev/ttyS1
/dev/ttyS1, Line 1, UART: 16550A, Port: 0x02f8, IRQ: 3
	Baud_base: 115200, close_delay: 50, divisor: 0
	closing_wait: 3000
	Flags: spd_normal skip_test low_latency
The serial port chip is 16550A, which has a built in fifo. Can this be
the source of my problems ?
