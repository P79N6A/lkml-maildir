Hi,
Here are some more USB fixes for 2.6.0-test2.  Again, more audit patches
from Oliver Neukum, and some other good fixes from David Brownell that
solve some bugzilla.kernel.org bug reports.
I've also fixed a stupid issue with the pl2303 driver that some people
were seeing, and got rid of all of the usages of the struct device .name
variable as it is going to go away soon.
Please pull from:  bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/linus-2.6
Patches will be posted to linux-usb-devel as a follow-up thread for
those who want to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
