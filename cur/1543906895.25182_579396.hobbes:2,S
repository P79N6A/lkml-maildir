you try to put the blame into distribution makers' shoes but in reality, 
had the kernel stepped forward with a neat .config option sooner 
(combined with a neat boot option as well to turn it off), we'd have had 
noatime systems 10 years ago. A new entry into relnotes and done. It's 
_much less_ of a compatibility impact than many of the changes that 
happen in a new distro release. (new glibc, new compiler, new kernel) 
Distro makers did not dare to do this sooner because some kernel 
developers came forward with these mostly bogus arguments ... The impact 
of atime is far better understood by the kernel community, so it is the 
responsibility of _us_ to signal such things towards distributors, not 
the other way around.
