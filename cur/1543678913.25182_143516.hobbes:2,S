Well, yes, it works - problem is I can't figure out how to get sound nor
VGA/SVGA working in it, and I need both to play the games I use DOS for.

Nope, not even going to try that one - I've used it before and the last
time I tried it, it had the same problems dos did. Not that it's a bad
program or anything.
Thanks for trying to help. If you know how to get dosemu working with
vga/svga and sound in linux console/x let me know.
Another option I'm going to try is booting off the 40GB disk I have
instead of the 100GB disk - should work as the CHS info given by the
bios agrees with the kernel.
We'll see.
