I am running the complete lsb-runtime-test suite against the new kernels
(as installed yesterday from the sid apt repo at
http://kernel-archive.buildserver.net/debian-kernel
), but I also did a
run with just the msync test, which passed.  I will report the results
for the full suite when they become available.
FWIW, here's uname:
Linux xenpc 2.6.18-4-xen-686 #1 SMP Mon Jan 1 02:33:53 UTC 2007 i686 GNU/Linux
