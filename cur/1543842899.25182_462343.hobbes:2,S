Thanks.
Isn't a Kconfig patch missing? I don't see any place that defines 
CONFIG_AS_CFI_SIGNAL_FRAME. Actually Kconfig wouldn't 
be very good for this, so auto testing would be preferable
(like the cfi test is doing) 
BTW the tree you generated it against doesn't seem to match the latest
tree. I had to fix some rejects.
Also it would be nice if you could give a full description that could
be used as a commit message.
Other than that it looks good.
Ok maybe a one liner comment on why UNW_DEFAULT_RA does this magic.
