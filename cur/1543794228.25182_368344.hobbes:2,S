We can do that. Well, Linus can do that... he holds the trademark, he 
could create a "Linux native driver" emblem. Have to be a tad careful to 
require open source to get it, but I don't know about requiring GPL. In 
the real world a single FOSS driver which could be used for Linux, BSD, 
and Solaris would be easier for a vendor to justify, but it would have 
to be covered by a license which satisfied all applications.
Even if it couldn't be part of a kernel.org source, at least if it were 
available in source it would satisfy better than ndis. Anyone with real 
expertise in what license could apply to all kernels please speak up.
None of this should imply that I have changed my mind about larger stack 
sizes being desirable.
