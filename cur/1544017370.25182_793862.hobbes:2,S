I'm not sure User Mode Linux still has a lot of users regularly testing the 
latest and greatest version.  (QEMU and KVM kinda took the wind out of its 
sails.)
I still find it useful to be able to stick printfs into the code and debug 
stuff even when the console isn't working, but I haven't been able to build a 
version of 2.6.28 that works for me at all:
cat > mini.conf << EOF
CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF=y
CONFIG_HOSTFS=y
CONFIG_LBD=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=y
CONFIG_STDERR_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS=y
CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y
CONFIG_EXT3_FS=y
CONFIG_STATIC_LINK=y
CONFIG_NO_HZ=y
CONFIG_UNEVICTABLE_LRU=y
EOF
make ARCH=um allnoconfig KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG=mini.conf
make ARCH=um -j 3
./linux rw init=/bin/bash rootfstype=hostfs
The result panics (twice) and exits, instead of giving me a shell prompt.  
Built and run on stock Ubuntu 8.10.  (I posted about it on tuesday, but nobody 
replied...)
