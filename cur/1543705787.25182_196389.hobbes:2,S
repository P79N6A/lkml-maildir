May be I am missing something obvious. When debugging a page fault handler if 
kgdb accesses an swapped-out user page doesn't it deadlock when trying to 
hold mm semaphore?
I use the global to let page fault handler that this access is from kgdb so 
don't try to load any pages, report an error instead.

I liked these.  Never got time to integrate them.

George has coded cfi directives i386 too. He can use them to backtrace past 
irqs stack.
