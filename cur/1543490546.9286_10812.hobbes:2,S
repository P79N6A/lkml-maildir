I tried 2.2.3 today.  I can now mount the as file read/write but now every
time a file is opened or written to, this error is generated:
fat_clusters_flush: Did not find valid FSINFO signature, found 0x534f4453
offset = 0x1e0
However, I can now successfully write files and expand files which is a big
bonus!  This error also appeared during the boot sequence under 2.0.36.
The total disk size is also being calculated incorrectly
# df
Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/hda1            2056284 -8025552  10081836   -389%   /
The real figures are 1,580Mb is used (387Mb free) are reported by Windows
95.
The disk was pre-formatted when I got the computer, and I have re-installed
Windows a number of times, possibly different versions.  Have there been any
reports of this problem on a newly formatted disk?
Neville.
