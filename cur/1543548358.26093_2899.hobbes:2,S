Thanks.  I see now that ECN stands for Explicit Congestion Notification, and 
indeed this is one of the options in "networking options".  I had looked at 
this, and obviously left it set to N.  I didn't get the connection between 
the acronym ECN and Explicit Congestion Notification.  The Help button for 
xconfig gives the RTFM, "No Help ..." response.  
Perhaps a documentation patch for the help response which warns of the 
possible problems with having ECN turned on would be appropriate.
