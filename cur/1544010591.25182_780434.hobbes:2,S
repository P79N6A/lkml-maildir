It's sad to see that a few hours after James Bottomley asked to stop
fighting, that you are again spreading half truths about Vladislav and
myself. We are not opposed to any usage of configfs, but as Vladislav
carefully explained, we consider it unfortunate that the current
version of configfs doesn't suit SCST's needs.
