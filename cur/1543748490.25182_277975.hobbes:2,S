Taking offline would cut the rest of the developers off from having
any empirical data to work with. It's a bad idea. The entire point
of the RT kernel and app is to characterize the behavior of the system
so that fringe events happen and so that they can be tracked down and
eventually solved. Continue on IMO. :)
