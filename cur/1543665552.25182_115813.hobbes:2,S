> why its not honouring PTBL values in his case apparently
The disk capacity code foolishly sets heads to 255, and then
ide_xlate_1024 decides that we already have chosen a translation,
so that it does not have to figure out what translation to use.

See:
        if (xparm == 2) {
                if (!heads ||
                   (drive->bios_head >= heads && drive->bios_sect == 63))
                        transl = 0;
        }
        if (xparm == -1) {
                if (drive->bios_head > 16)
                        transl = 0;     /* we already have a translation */
        }
