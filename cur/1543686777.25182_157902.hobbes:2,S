ok good. I'm betting it's the shm backport that destabilized something.
I had no time to look further into it during vacations ;), but the first
suspect thing I mentioned to Hugh during OLS was this:
static void shmem_removepage(struct page *page)
{
	if (!PageLaunder(page))
		shmem_free_blocks(page->mapping->host, 1);
}
It's not exactly obvious how the accounting should change in function of
the Launder bit. I mean, a writepage can happen even w/o the launder
bitflag set (if it's not invoked by the vm) and I don't see how a msync
or a vm pressure writepage trigger should be different in terms of
accounting of the blocks in an inode.
Overall I need a bit more of time on Monday to digest the whole backport
to be sure of what's going on and if the above is right after all.
