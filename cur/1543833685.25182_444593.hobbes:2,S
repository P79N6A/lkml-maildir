well Aunt Tilly gets confused by all hardware that is not present on her
machine; she has no idea what a platform is. By that reasoning, we
should make kconfig hide all non-present hardware.
Also I think there is no difference in confusion between showing 10 or
15 IDE chipsets. Either the user knows what he has (and then it doesn't
matter) or those 10 are too much already.
