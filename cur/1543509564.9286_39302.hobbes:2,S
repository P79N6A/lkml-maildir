Subject: [PATCH] console alertness - notifying of console activities
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello.
I always wanted the console to be able to alert me when something happened it
it. So I started writing a patch to allow me to set a virtual console so that
it gets switched to whenever it beeps. I then expanded it so that now you
can:
 - have the vc switched to when it beeps,
 - have the vc switched to when anything is written to it,
 - have the vc beep whenever anything is written to it
 - do nothing of the above. 8-)
See the documentation file at the end of the patch for details. And tell me
if you feel such functionality is desired.
The patch applies cleanly with 2.2.12 and 2.3.18, it was originally made for
2.2.10.
(Is this mail enough for the patch to get into the main kernel or what should
I do if I get positive responses about it?)

+This file describes the console alertness function of linux virtual consoles
+as implemented by Jacek Kopecky (jacek@unforgettable.com) in July 1999.
+
+First, what does console alertness mean anyway?
+In cases when you want to be warned when something changes or only beeps on a
+virtual console other than the one that's active at the moment (so that you
+don't see the changes yourself), you can use the following escape sequences
+to set the console-alertness-level to get some warnings:
+
+echo -ne "\033[15;0]" > /dev/ttyX	    alertnes off ("beep on beep")
+echo -ne "\033[15;1]" > /dev/ttyX	    beep on write to the console
+echo -ne "\033[15;2]" > /dev/ttyX	    switch to the console on beep
+echo -ne "\033[15;3]" > /dev/ttyX	    switch to the console on write
+
+At the level 1 the virtual console /dev/ttyX beeps whenever anything is
+written to it but only if the console is not currently the foreground console.
+The level 2 makes the console get switched to whenever it beeps. On the highest
+level the console gets switched to on each write to it.
+
+A side-effect of setting beep-on-write (1) or switch-on-write (3) on another
+console is that the other console beeps or is switched to, this comes handy
+as a test it's working. 8-)
+The sequence for setting the switch-on-beep (2) level can be enhanced to give
+the same kind of test:
+
+echo -ne "\033[15;2]\a" > /dev/ttyX
+
+The setting sequences may seem to be a little too user-unfriendly so I'm
+planning to try to incorporate alertness setting into the setterm package.
+
+Enjoy. 8-)
