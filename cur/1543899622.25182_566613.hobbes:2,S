The pv_ops infrastructure doesn't support modular pv_ops 
implementations, and if it did, there's certainly no intention of 
supporting non-GPL implementations.
At the same time that all the other altinstruction patching happens, it 
converts any indirect calls via paravirt_ops into direct calls to the 
target function, bypassing struct paravirt_ops altogether.  After that 
the structure is pretty much only used for patching modules.  Any 
attempt at writing a modular pv_ops implementation would fail as a result.
