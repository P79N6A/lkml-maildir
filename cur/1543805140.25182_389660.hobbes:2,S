Subject: kernel freeze on 2.4.32, apparently in cached_lookup

I have a Pentium 4 machine running stock kernel 2.4.32
with ext3 on LVM on software RAID-1. HIMEM is enabled and
the machine has 3GB of RAM. Various details of the machine
and kernel as here:

http://ex-parrot.com/~chris/tmp/20060124/caesious-cpuinfo

http://ex-parrot.com/~chris/tmp/20060124/caesious-lspci
Occasionally -- often when running updatedb or another
disk-heavy cron job, but sometimes during normal use of
the machine -- the machine freezes up almost entirely
(mouse pointer stops working, ditto VC switching, no
console output if on the text console, SSH sessions
freeze, but network packet forwarding and NAT still work).
There's no output on the VGA console and the machine
doesn't respond to Ctrl-Alt-Sysrq, but does respond to
break+... on the serial console. That gives sysrq-p output
like this, from the most recent freeze:

-- repeating sysrq+p suggests that the kernel is stuck in 
d_lookup:

There's no oops or other message logged.
(I'm running a uniprocessor kernel -- the SMP kernel also
freezes under similar circumstances, and I wanted to
eliminate the SMP code as a source of problems.)
Does this look like a known problem? If not, what should I
do next to track down the problem? In particular, what
other information should I try to collect next time it
freezes?
