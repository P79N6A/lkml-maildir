Hello all!
I would like to report/confirm success in solving the problem
described after applying the patch below:
> > 
http://client.linux-nfs.org/Linux-2.6.x/2.6.12/linux-2.6.12-43-dirent_fix.dif
> >
> > This should normally suffice to fix the SGI problem.
Yes, it effectively eliminates both type of problems for our/my
configuration here - the 'find'-error as well as the 'resources'-
error (= OpenOffice 'printer' and Mathematica 'fonts, files,
directories etc.). Thus this patch is more effective that the
one in KNOPPIX' 4.0 kernel!
Thought, you'd like to know.
My sincere thanks to all helping out in this, here.
As I normally don't read the lists involved, I won't see other
problems with nfs and the SGI configuration. Should you feel
that testing here could be of any help, then please don't
hesitate to ask me about it - I'd like to return the favour
granted, if I can.

This is fine with me - I just wanted to let everyone involved know
about the outcome. [This is most probably my last report regarding
this 'bug'. Thus you're all going to miss this 'fine tcpdump'-list
I promised; that is, unless somebody asks for it :-).]
Thanks again,
 Ruediger Oberhage
