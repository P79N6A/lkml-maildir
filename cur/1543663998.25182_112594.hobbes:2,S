But isn't 200MB too much?  Where would the new setting put the
reserve mark?

Well, it has been set to 500, but it didn't make any difference
(at least no obvious difference).  Is there anything more one
could do about that?  The current level of swapping hurts
performance quite a bit.  This is what the meminfo looks
like:
        total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:
Mem:  6341447680 6134513664 206934016        0 66162688 5240639488
