Part of the problem with EXPERIMENTAL is that it's been taken
to mean all sorts of things over the years from "this isn't quite ready, but works"
to "if you enable this, you're a lunatic".  It's meant that pretty much
everyone has to enable CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL anyway for a kernel offering
the features everyone has come to expect.  As means of example, I'll bet
there's no (or at least very few) distros that ship a kernel with
CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL disabled.
