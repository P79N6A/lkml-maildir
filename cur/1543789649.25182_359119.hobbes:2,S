None of the recent kernels can resume-from-ram reliably for me
if I use CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND (set).   But with that option UNset,
suspend/resume to/from RAM works very well.
BUT.. new in 2.6.14-rc*, is that the ehci_hcd USB hispeed driver
no longer survives resume from ram.  I have to unload/reload the
module to get hispeed USB after resume.
