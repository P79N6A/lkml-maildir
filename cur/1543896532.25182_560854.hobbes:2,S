Git itself, nor bitkeeper was not the main reason behind the desition
to maintain 2.6.x as the stable kernel going forward.

I myself have argued that we should be focusing more on stability and
regression fixing, but I'm not so sure that a 2.6.7 devel branch would
solve this. In general the 2.6.x.y -stable kernels seem to be doing
the job pretty good.

How is the GPLv2 vs GPLv3 debate relevant to kernel stability, ABI
stability or anything else of the sort?

What I think you are wishing for is a stable API - which is not going
to happen; please read Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt
(
http://lxr.linux.no/source/Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt
).
A stable ABI we already have.

In what way?
Most users should be using distribution kernels anyway, not vanilla
kernel.org kernels. Those distribution kernels should provide you with
all the stability you require.

As far as I am aware, both nVidia and ATI have closed drivers
available for you to use if you please. And they should work just fine
with most distribution kernels as well as vanilla.

I don't think you have demonstrated that.
How specifically is the current development model hurting you?
What exactely would we gain by switching back to the old
stable/unstable branch model?

It sure is an object, it's even called object code. I think the name
suits just fine. In any case, it's just a name.

A stable ABI is very much a wanted feature and one that a lot of work
goes into maintaining.

If they want to keep their drivers closed they get to do all the hard
work of tracking kernel API changes. Their choice, their problem. I
don't think you'll find very many people on this list who gives a damn
about the troubles of closed source driver developers.
