I've been trying to figure out how to do these series of tests against
my system, they involve file access, modification, creation, deletion,
etc. The tests can't be split up to only run against particular
sub-directories of /. I would rather not risk running these tests on
my system unprotected. I've investigated using unionfs but it won't
let me union / with a subdirectory. I've also looked into installwatch
but it will only show what's been touched after the fact.  Also
there's quite a bit of data in lots of small files so copying
everything then doing a chroot is also out of the question. Any
suggestions as to what to use and how I can go about performing these
tests would be useful.
