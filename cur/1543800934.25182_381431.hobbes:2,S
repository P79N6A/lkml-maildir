this is version 14 of the generic mutex subsystem, against v2.6.15.
The patch-queue consists of 21 patches, which can also be downloaded

Changes since -V13:

 - VFS: converted sb->s_lock to a mutex too. This improves the
   create+unlink benchmark on ext3.
 - further simplification of __mutex_lock_common(): no more gotos, and
   only one atomic_xchg() is done. Code size is now extremely small on 
   both UP and SMP:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    398       0       0     398     18e mutex.o.UP
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    463       0       0     463     1cf mutex.o.SMP
 - synchro-test updates: max # of threads of 64, fairness stats,
   better defaults if =y, cleanups. (David Howells, me)
 - FASTCALL -> fastcall in mutex.h (suggested by David Howells)
 - documentation updates
