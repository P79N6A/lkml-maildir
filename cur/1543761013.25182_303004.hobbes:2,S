sir,
    i will give a presentation on j.f.s. . i read that at the time of 
asynchronous update the update of transactions are made maintaining an 
ordering, but i read that it is not so simple if the updation is 
synchronous. and i also don't know how the situation is handled.
   i request to inform me about that syncrhonous update so that i can get 
understand what the actual problem is and how the situation is handled.
