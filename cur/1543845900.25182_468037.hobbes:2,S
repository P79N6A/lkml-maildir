Len and I discussed that patch some.  The question about it is:
why does gcc report this at all?  Is this a gcc problem or are
we misreading it somehow?
 drivers/acpi/tables/tbget.c: In function 'acpi_tb_get_this_table':
drivers/acpi/tables/tbget.c:326: warning: format '%X' expects type 'unsigned int', but argument 5 has type 'long unsigned int'
drivers/acpi/tables/tbrsdt.c: In function 'acpi_tb_validate_rsdt':
drivers/acpi/tables/tbrsdt.c:189: warning: format '%X' expects type 'unsigned int', but argument 5 has type 'long unsigned int'
Why does it think that sizeof(struct X) is long unsigned int?
(and only on 64-bit)
