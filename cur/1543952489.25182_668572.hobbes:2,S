Seems we don't. At least this addition didn't yield anything:
ide_startstop_t ide_error (ide_drive_t *drive, const char *msg, u8 stat)
{
        ide_hwif_t *hwif = drive->hwif;
        struct request *rq = hwif->hwgroup->rq;
        u8 err;
              printk("ide_error(msg=%s, stat=%i)\n",msg,stat);
              WARN_ON(1);
               if (rq && rq->cmd_type == REQ_TYPE_ATA_TASKFILE) {
Going to bed...
