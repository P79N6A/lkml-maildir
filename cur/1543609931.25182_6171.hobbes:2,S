It counts the number of successful fork(), vfork() and clone() system
calls (and other in-kernel calls of do_fork(), which are, e.g. used to
create idle tasks for all CPUs on SMP systems).  So, yes, it does
include (kernel level) threads.
(The above is obtained from several greps on 2.4.12 source tree)
