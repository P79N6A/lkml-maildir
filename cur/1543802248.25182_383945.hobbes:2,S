Hmm...access to task_struct->xxx has been racy, but accessing the 
signal->* counters were not.  What if read of the signal->utime  was  a 
hoisted read and signal->stime was a read after the counter is updated?  
This was not a possibility earlier no?

We would be saving 1 buslocked operation in that case (on some arches), a 
cacheline fetch for exclusive (since signal and sighand are on different memory
locations), and disabling/enabling onchip interrupts.  But yes, this would be a 
smaller optimization....Unless you have strong objections this can also 
go in?
Thanks,
