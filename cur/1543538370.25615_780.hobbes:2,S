The patent is held by the Swiss company Ascom. Licensing details are at:

Ask a lawyer.
But why use IDEA? The AES process to chhose a new US standard cipher is almost
over; a winner should be declared in the next month or two.
http://www.ii.uib.no/~larsr/aes.html
A condition of entry was that any cipher that wins must be released for open
use,
with no license restrictions. Two of the five finalists, IBM's MARS and RSA's
RC6,
have formally agreed to that condition, but have not said what they'll do if
they
are not chosen. The other three -- Rjindael, Twofish and Serpent -- are already
released for general use. Use one of them!
Code for all of them, with an open license, is available on Brian Gladwin's
page:
http://www.btinternet.com/~brian.gladman/
There are other sources for most of them as well.
