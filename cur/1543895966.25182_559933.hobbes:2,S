if you also make the assumption that the company won't use propriatary 
software instead then I think you would get agreement. but the 
disagrement is over this exact assumption. you assume that these companies 
will use non-tivoized products if you make it hard to use the software 
covered by the GPL, most other people are saying that they disagree and 
the result would be fewer companies useing software covered by GPL 
instead.
