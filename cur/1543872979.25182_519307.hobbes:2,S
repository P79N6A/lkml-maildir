It ought to be rock solid, perhaps you can send me a detailed bug report.
In fact it actually doesn't do very much at all as the controller is
smart enough to do all the hard work itself.

The two drive the devices identically although if there was a problem I
guess the libata one would recover better.
Would appreciate bug reports anyway so I can do more detailed analysis.
