Please, no insults. I like this cdrecord -scanbus too, but I would like it 
more, if it would also print pure ide devices ;)
On the other hand I usually also don't care since k3b does all this stuff for 
me.

Well, the usual reaction is 'cdrecord whats that? Commandline interface, 
parameters? Hey, I want to burn a CD and don't like reading manpages for 
stuff like that'. I guess that at least 95% of all people who would like to 
burn a CD will prefer (and also use) a grahical interface.
The hole discussion which cdrecord -dev parameter to use is completely 
useless, it only effects a clear minority of developers and guys who probably 
don't like graphical interfaces at at all. Those guys should be able to adopt 
to whatever -dev option is possible.
Please, calm down and return to usefull technical discussions.
