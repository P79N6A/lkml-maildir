Hi,
I am running into a problem and due to limited understanding unable to
solve it...
Problem:
-------------
On 64 bit machines (running linux 2.6.xx), Committed_AS grows over the
period of time. Within 3-4 weeks system reaches a stage where further
malloc() returns -ENOMEM. Test shows that just running simple program
(which malloc, touch, free memory) cause this increase in Committed_AS
number.  (I am using vm-overcommit... Below detailed information)
System/Kernel Spec:
------------------------------
-----
CentOS kernel, 2.6.9-34.EL-x86_64_SMP
Physical: 8G
Swap: 2G
Machine type: AMD
Nothing un-usual in .config. Pretty much using standard options. (If
needed I will send .config)
Here is /proc/meminfo numbers:
MemTotal:      8169736 kB

OverCommit Options:
---------------------------------
vm.overcommit_ratio = 100
vm.overcommit_memory = 2
Hence my virtual limit is 10G (8*100/100 + 2)
Detailed Description:
-------------------------------
I have noticed that 64 bit machine with overcommit policy (as above)
starts giving problem within 3-4 weeks. To prove that I've written
small program.
 It allocates memory of different sizes (not that it matters much due
to caching of diffeent malloc. I am using standard ptmalloc). Sizes
are 16B, 32B, 64B, 256B, 1024B, 57B, 127B and so on... . Then it
touches that memory (memset) and then free it. These operations are
being performed in while(1) loop.
Observations:
----------------------
Committed_AS: number gorws 5M per hour. I made sure that nothing else
is running on the system during that time...
Is there any obvious problem reported for vm accounting on 64 bit
architecture ? Or this is expected ? Or vm-overcommit is only meant
for 32 bit architecture ?
Please advice..
Thanks in advance.
