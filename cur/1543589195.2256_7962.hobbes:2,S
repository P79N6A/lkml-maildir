IMO this is pointless
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        517456     505332      12124     111016      97752     236884
-/+ buffers/cache:     170696     346760
Swap:       131048      23216     107832
Of course for me, I'm not about to waste 1gb of disk space for swap.
The swap I have is 2 partitions, one on each drive both with a priority of
0.  Personally, I like the way it's done on my box.
