Whoever actually owns the rights to the firmware these days is going
to be practically impossible to track down. The rights were sold off
left and right when Alteon sold out to Nortel and Nortel then
imploded. 
The s2io/neterion guys may or may not know, but I doubt anyone is
willing to spend real company manhours trying to track down a legal
trace for a dead product which hasn't been manufactured for years and
nobody really cares about technology wise anymore.
