Sorry for my late reply, too. I had been out of country and away from
Internet.

Yes, the warning is there. However, there never had been a problem with
it for years until I upgraded the kernel. I probably should have paid
more attention to that warning... The problem is that most of the links
are broken on the page that you refer to.
I am pretty sure now that the DMA-error is related to smart as the
server run without problems for a couple of weeks until someone started
smartd again by mistake. Three days later the box froze again just after
1 am.
