Hmm.. Looks ok to me, have you been able to test some SCSI and IDE
cases with this?
Also, I'm as big a fan of Stranger in a Strange Land as anybody else, but
that doesn't really mean that I think "grok_partitions()" is necessarily
the best name. How about just "parse_partitions()" or something, I don't
think the code really meets the required level of intimate and consummate
understanding of partitions to call it "grok"..
