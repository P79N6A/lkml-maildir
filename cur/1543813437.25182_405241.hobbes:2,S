Right: I forgot to mention it, but I did test it both ways, and
ec_intr=0 is fine.

I cannot reproduce it with the vanilla DSDT, only with the modified
one.  But:

> I need calltrace for this 
Looking at /proc/acpi/debug_level, I see several debugging choices
that might give the calltrace you want.  Let me know which ones are
essential (I'd turn all of them on; however, I found when trying to
track this down earlier that the bug would slither away if I had too
much debugging turned on):
ACPI_LV_DISPATCH	       0x00000100 [ ]
ACPI_LV_EXEC		       0x00000200 [ ]
ACPI_LV_NAMES		       0x00000400 [ ]
ACPI_LV_FUNCTIONS	       0x00200000 [ ]
By the way, a long standing buglet for me is that 'cat
/proc/acpi/debug_level' truncates the output to 1024 bytes.  So I have
to do 'cat /proc/acpi/debug_level | cat' so that the first cat doesn't
find that its stdout is a tty and try to reduce its buffer size from
4096 (big enough) to 1024.  A patch is available at
<

> BTW, do you still think this is a regression?
I'm 95% sure, because booting with ec_intr=0 avoids the problem, so
the commit that made ec_intr=1 the default almost certainly also makes
this bug appear.
