OK.. reproduce is easy: try to run wine with MS IE4.  When it crashes,
quit the debugger and try a ps aux.  It should hang...  When I ls in the
/proc/PID dir it hangs.  But if I strace the ls it runs through ok, which
strikes me as very odd.  Incidently, the hang occures if I try to cat any
of the files in the wine PIDs dir.
But I am out of my depth now.... I hope this info is of use to someone.  I
don't have a clue how to proceed.
