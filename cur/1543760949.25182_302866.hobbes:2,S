Really?  Who counts interrupts???  The timer code treats jiffies as a unit of 
time.  You will need to rewrite that to make it otherwise.  But then you have 
another problem.  To correctly function, times need to expire on time (hay how 
bout that) not some time later.  To do this we need an interrupt source.  To 
this point in time, the jiffies interrupt has been the indication that one or 
more timer may have expired.  While we don't need to "count" the interrupts, we 
DO need them to expire the timers AND they need to be on time.
