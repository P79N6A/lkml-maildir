   Does the kernel see arp responses coming in on both interfaces? Arp
   responses will have a destination MAC address which specifies only
   one of the interfaces, won't they?
   So only one interface will actually see any given arp response.
If you were a client on a network, and happened to hear an ARP
response, wouldn't you want to make note of it for possible future
reference?
Broadcast ARPs do happen, but do not denote "reachability" in the
neighbour sense, but they do demark the hardware header for that host
so the kernel will indeed save it away when seen.
