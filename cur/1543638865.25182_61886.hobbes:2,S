on a 32/33 slot, with a quad fast ethernet card, I can reach 400 Mbps
on good hardware. The *theorical* bandwidth limit is 1.06 Gbps for
32 bits/33 Mhz. Of course, there's some overhead, but you would need 80%
overhead to get you numbers, not very likely...
Perhaps this slot is on another bus, perhaps the latency timer is too
low and the card receives small chunks at once, or perhaps this bus
is shared with another hungry device ?
