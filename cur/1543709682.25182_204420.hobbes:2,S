Generally, it's a good idea to search the LKML archives (via 
marc.theaimsgroup.com or google group search) for your problem before 
posting, to see if it has already been reported.
For future reference, oopsen containing the _nvXX symbols are NVIDIA driver 
specific problems and should not be reported to this list.
This problem is well known and is trivially fixed, I am confident NVIDIA are 
already aware of it and it will be repaired in the next revision of the 
driver.
