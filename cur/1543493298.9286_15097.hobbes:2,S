Sound like the board in the system is the N440BX motherboard from Intel (I
have one server with the same board)...
I had similar problems...But with an AMImegaRAID controller....
What finally solved the problem was:
Turn on the onboard scsi controllers...
Boot from the Intel CD ROM that came with the system...
(If you can't do the above, you can make a three disk SSU set from the
CDROM from a DOS/Windows PC)
Run the SSU (System Setup Utility)..
Make sure the IRQs/DMAs/IOs are not conflicting.....
On my server the builtin 10/100 NIC & RAID & a Comtroll Rocket Port card were
all using IRQ 11...The machine would sporadically lock up.....after a few
days...a few hours....etc..etc...Usually only when there was a lot of network
AND scsi/raid activity....
Just resetting the configuration data on the motherboard does not resolv
IRQ conflicts for some reason...It acutally resets them and does not conflict
checking...When I ran the SSU..and when into view the resources on each
card..Then the SSU told me there was a conflict...and only then could I
assign the IRQ properly (an manually)...Also check with Intel for
BIOS/SCSI Firmware updates on that board...I know there are some...
Note this may not fix your first problem (Since I did not experience
similar)...But it did fix my second problem...Also check with Siemens to see
if it is a stock Intel N440BX MB (It sure sound like one)....
