	WE GOT SOME OUTPUT!  I just got this message from our sys admin:
In any case, I happened to be on it last night when it fell over, and the
console messages indicated a kernel dereference of a NULL pointer within
an interrupt handler.  I'm guessing it's our race condition.
	He now fully believes that it isn't a problem with NFS.  (Odd...
That was our first guess, and I thought it was pretty good, too.)  It
looks like it's a race condition, and we suspect it's in the 3c59x driver.
(Seeing as Andrea Arcangeli found a race condition in the 3c509 driver...)
Of course, it *could* be something worse...
