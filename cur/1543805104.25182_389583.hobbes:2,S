Adding special cases to no end.
Is this really sensible?
How about leaving RLIMIT_MEMLOCK alone (and at RLIM_INFINITY) for root
processes altogether? At least that wouldn't add a new special case but
just change the existing one to remove an inconsistency, and the effect
will be the same, only that it is inherited across seteuid().
I doubt that the kernel is the right place to implement policies that
belong into user space.  As long as the kernel is meant to be universal,
any default will collide with an application's requirement sooner or
later.
