Hear, hear!  
Also, Marcelo should get in touch with the nice folks at stp@osdlab.org
and find out what sort of regression tests they will be running on
his kernels.  Perhaps he can wait for their feedback on the -rcX
kernels before declaring them final.  (Not that they would have
found the 2.4.15 problem with their current tests, but they'll
catch a few things.)
