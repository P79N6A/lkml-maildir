sys time is not neccessarily CPU time.

Ask the vendor.

The PIIX interface needs CPU intervention each command, so in practice
about every 64K or so, and the CPU gets stalled waiting for the disk
during the setup of each I/O. The newer kernels support AHCI which does
not have this overhead, but it is only present on the newest intel
controllers.

Waiting for the disk I would imagine.
