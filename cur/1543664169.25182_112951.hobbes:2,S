Subject: [PATCH 3/8] dm: prevent possible buffer overflow in ioctl interface
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Use the correct size for "name" in register_with_devfs().
During Al Viro's devfs cleanup a few versions ago, this function was
rewritten, and the "name" string added. The 32-byte size is not large
enough to prevent a possible buffer overflow in the sprintf() call,
since the hash cell can have a name up to 128 characters.
