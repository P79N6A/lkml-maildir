To quote the document leaked from MS last year on Linux:
   There are literally hundreds of small research projects attempting to
       improve various parts of the Linux OS.
       Some projects include:
     * Linux 2.2 - High Availability features such as deeper RAID support
       (RAID 0, 1, 5 supported today), volume management; file system
       performance improvements; asynchronous I/O & completion ports;
       Ipv6; . An excellent feature summary can be found on:

Seems we already have completion ports ;)
If I recall they were added late in the 2.1.x development cycle, you wasted
a full head of steam and a batch of flames for nothing I'm afraid.
