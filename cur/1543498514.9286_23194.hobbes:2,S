[snip the massive repost]
Hrrrmmm.... Headers are pretty interesting. Smells like an attempt to
organize a distributed mailbomb. 
Possibilities:
	a) author has a strong persecution complex.
	b) ALLEGED author had seriously pissed off some idiot.
IMHO the latter is much more... Ooops. Here comes the third copy. Scratch
(a) - 800 quatloos say that it's an attempt to revenge.
Dinesh is from .my, AFAIK. Folks, abstain from replying to him, please.
Most likely he had pissed of some local luser who tries to use us for
revenge.
