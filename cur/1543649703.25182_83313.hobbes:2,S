Hm,
I've been in a hurry when I wrote my first mail. What I meant was:
- I remove drivers/char/mem.c from my kernel. What do I lose? (/dev/null,
  /dev/zero and /dev/full afaics but cut this down to "i remove everything
  related to mem_fops, kmem_fops and port_fops").
- I remove write_mem(), write_kmem() and write_port() from drivers/char/mem.c 
  What do I lose?
Removing CAP_SYS_RAWIO is nice, but I actually want to remove the code
from the kernel, not just disabling it (Yes, of course I could try but
my test box is in pieces ATM...).
The pointer to the Xserver is a good one. Thanks. 
	Regards
		Henning
