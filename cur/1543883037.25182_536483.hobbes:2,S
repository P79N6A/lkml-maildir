Well, you've proposed:
   1. write the pte entries unconditionally
   2. a callback to ask what permissions each page should be mapped
   3. a general mechanism to query for pages which require special
      mappings, such at PAT in the native case, and RO for Xen
      and I've proposed:
   4. if we're given a template pagetable, then don't overwrite any
      existing mapping
1 works in general, but it doesn't work for Xen because it ends up
mapping pagetable pages RW.
If 2 is constrained to boot-time init then its reasonably possible to
implement, but it will add a new paravirt_op which isn't going to make
Andi happy.  A general mechanism will be extremely hard to implement,
because I don't know of an efficient way to identify whether a
particular pfn is part of a pagetable or not.
3 suffers the same problem as the general form of 2, but its more
ambitious since it would also allow identification of pages with an
arbitrary set of special properties.
Perhaps 2 and 3 could be implemented by stashing some state in the page
structure, but that's no use for pagetable_init, because page structures
don't exist at that point.
4 is what I've implemented.  It works for Xen, but it currently prevents
non-PAE native booting from properly constructing a PSE mapping for the
kernel.  And as you point out, it also prevents harmless (from Xen's
perspective) updates of the page permissions.  Plus it just adds a bit
more uglification entropy to mm/init.c.
So, in summary:
Given that 1 is unworkable for Xen, 2 is kind of groady, 3 is
longer-term research project and 4 is buggy, we need something else.
I don't have any particularly bright ideas, but there is the other idea
I mentioned.  I could pre-initialize the pagetable with the Xen
template, but use unconditional calls to set_pte in pagetable_init. 
However, the init-time xen_set_pte simply refuse to set _PAGE_WRITE on a
pte which isn't already writable, thereby protecting the RO state of the
pagetable pages.  Once pagetable construction has finished, it would
switch to the real xen_set_pte, which operates as normal.
This has the downside of making init-time xen_set_pte a little strange,
but it does have the advantage of making the Xen constraints solely the
responsibility of the Xen code, and it is mitigated by the fact that it
is only in effect during pagetable_init.
Would that work for everyone?
