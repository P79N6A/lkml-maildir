This reminds me of Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt . That no one
should really be dependent on a particular kernel API doing a particular
thing. The kernel is play dough for the kernel hacker (as it should be),
including kernel semaphores.
So we can change whatever we want, and make no excuses, as long as we
fix the rest of the kernel to work with our change. That seems pretty
sensible , because Linux should be an evolution.
