I agree completely.  I'd love to see it there.
I'd even help break^W fix it.

Q: If kdb were a kernel option, would the official version be out of
   date, the way it is now?
A: no.
Q: If kdb were a kernel option, would Linus be called on to fix it
   when it breaks?
A: no, obviously not, Linus is too busy
Q: Who would fix it then?
A: Whoever breaks it.
Q: What if Linus breaks it?
A: That's a special case.  I personally will drop whatever I'm doing
   and try to fix it.  I will cordially invite J. Dow, J. Merkey, R.
   Gootch, and various other degenerate powertool lovers to help.
Q: Would kdb in the kernel result in more bugs getting fixed faster?
A: Yes, no doubt
Q: Do we need more bugs fixed faster?
A: Yes, we need that desperately.
Q: Would kdb in the kernel give us more eyes on the bugs, making them
   even shallower than they already are?
A: Why, yes it would.
Q: Will kdb make your kernel bigger or slow it down?
A: Not if you don't use it.
Q: Is kdb a big patch?
A: It's only 93K, zipped.
Q: Then why isn't kdb in the kernel?
A: Uh...
