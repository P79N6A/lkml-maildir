I assume you mean in meta-data -- Yes at
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs/kernel-2.3/
which I plan to merge my stuff with.

Yes when -ENODATA or -ENOSYS I try cooking up some defaults.

look at that ftp stuff-- fcaps and libcap etc.

Look at the patch there, it currently doesn't define how caps live past
reboots. The fcaps-module stores the caps in separate linked list I
beleive not in dentry. That is temporary until ext3 or whatever I presume.

At best the might be able to lift some extraly impossed restrictions.
Noone can seriously suggest that info in the files can be used to raise
caps.

Especially since such headers can only used to restrict not to gain caps.

You use defaults again.

look at the above patch.

I think that limitations and restrictions are good to be closely
bound with the executable. Enablers should be easy to shake.

I'll have to look at that.

Hopefully soonish you can add
http://www.millenniumproductsllc.com/sjp/
I was hopeing to have merged patch and to decouple the elf from elfcap so
that other binary formats could in theory use the same similar mechanism.
I also am thinking of new way to scan through notes that is extensible.
I guess I had best get cracking.

Any caps I mention are *derived* from a withdrawn draft posix document.
I've finally "unsoiled" myself;->
