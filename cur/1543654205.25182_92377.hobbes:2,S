Hi all:
I have the same question that most people must have, why I need to
manually erase swap to avoid excesive paging after a couple of uptime
days ??.
Once i have most of my RAM ocupied (more than 50% by cache ona a 1GB
box) the swaping starts to be a problem,  I know the problem is that i
like a fancy desktop style, and memory eating programs to read the damn
email, but I think there should be a way to decrese the swaping isnt it
??.. after all, most of the ram is in chache !!, is it really that
necesary ??
BTW, im starting to have the same "old" pagging problem with
2.4.20-rc2-ac3. after 1 uptime day. and it seems to be getting worst,
could it be a hardware problem ??, maybe my ram chips are passing the
way ?
If i'm doing something wrong please send me some recomendations.
Best regards
Max
