I think Tomas has just hit upon why top posting is fundamentally wrong.
Indo-European languages read left to right, Semitic languages read right
to left, and some Oriental languages read top to bottom, but no human
languages I'm aware of read bottom to top.  
Consider a Cafe sign:
C
a
f
e
That is readable.  How about:
e
f
a
C
Not very readable unless you spend extra processing time to think about
it. Reading bottom to top is counter-intuitive and wastes time. Speaking
of which, apologies to all who feel they've wasted time by reading this.
Hmm, it looks like you top-posters out there are in good company. 
Marcelo seems to be taking the lead.  Grumble.
