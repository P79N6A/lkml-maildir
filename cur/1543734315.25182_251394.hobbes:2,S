TIME_WAIT status does not eat much resource, since they're in a separate
list. I've already had several *millions* of while stressing some equipment,
and I can assure you that it's really not a problem as long as you increase
your tcp_max_tw_buckets accordingly. There is even no performance impact
(I could still get 40000 hits/s with this number of time-waits). As David
said, the connection has been closed when it enters TIME_WAIT, so it has
been detached from apache.
I think you confuse it with CLOSE_WAIT. This is a very common case on web
servers when the client does not support HTTP keep-alive and does a
shutdown(WRITE) after sending its request. The server receives the FIN, and
passes from ESTABLISHED to CLOSE_WAIT during all the time it sends its data
to the client, then closes the connection, making it TIME_WAIT.
TIME_WAIT state is more annoying on the client side (eg when your apache
is a reverse proxy), because by default you can run out of source ports.
But you can increase the local source port range (ip_local_port_range),
decrease the FIN timeout which also happens to control TIME_WAIT timeout,
and even force tcp_tw_reuse to 1 to let the system reallocate an old
connection which was sitting in TIME_WAIT.
Hoping this helps,
Willy
