   Your net/ipv4/tcp.c patch from the NE2000 thread cured them even
   before I found the hardware fault. Has that patch gone to the
   queue? I recommend it.
The bugs I was "fixing" there were due to problems in wait queue
exclusivity nesting.  We instead fixed wait queue exclusivity nesting
so it actually worked in test11-pre3, can you see if by itself that
kernel does not show your problems too?
Thanks.
