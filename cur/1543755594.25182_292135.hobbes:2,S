As Ingo said in an earlier a post, with a little ingenuity this problem 
can be solved in user space.  The programs in question can be setuid 
root so that they can set RT scheduling policy BUT have their 
permissions set so that they only executable by owner and group with the 
group set to a group that only contains those users that have permission 
to run this program in RT mode.  If you wish to allow other users to run 
the program but not in RT mode then you would need two copies of the 
program: one set up as above and the other with normal permissions.
It may be necessary for users that are members of this RT group to do a 
newgrp before running this program if it isn't their primary group.  But 
that could be done in a shell wrapper.
If you have the source code for the programs then they could be modified 
to drop the root euid after they've changed policy.  Or even do the 
group membership check inside the program and if the user that launches 
the program is not a member of the group drop root euid immediately on 
start up.
