That's not always good enough.  In this case, there are good reasons
for _not_ doing it, too.  Both ways have advantages.  In that sort of
situation, it's best to leave it a config/boot option (as you do), 
but to make the default behaviour no change.  It's gratuitously 
changing the default behaviour in a way which is not backwards 
compatible which causes the most grief, and there's no need to do that
in this situation as far as I can see.
