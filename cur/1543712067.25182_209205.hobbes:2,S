Thanks for this comment.

For readability and maintaining purpose, we prefer to have these static
variables defined to their initial states.

Agree. We are thinking of replacing the semantics of assign_irq_vector() 
in existing arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c with the semantics of 
assign_irq_vector() in drivers/pci/msi.c. With this way, 
+#ifndef CONFIG_IA64
int assign_irq_vector(int irq)
{
is no longer required. If inputs from lkml agree with this approach, 
then we will make the change accordingly.

Glad you pointed it out. I think the function name pci_vector_resources() 
has a little confusion. The purpose of this function is to return the number
of vectors currently avaiable in the system for any new allocations, not 
already in use. First argument, last, indicates the last vector already 
assigned and second argument, nr_released, indicates the number of vectors
released by devices being hot-removed. 
Regarding your example, the last assigned vector is 0x39, the 
return should be 187 (vectors left available for new allocation) if 
nr_released was 0 (no device is hot-removed). If the device, which claims
vector 0x39 was hot-removed, then nr_released was 1; as a result, 
pci_vector_resources() returns 188. The case of nr_released of 2 was 
impossible. If you think of the better name for this function, we are glad 
to rename it. Please let's know what you think.
Thanks,
Long
