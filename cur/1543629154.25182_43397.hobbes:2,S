If you are bored, you might compare this to the MQ scheduler
at 
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/lse/2.4.14.mq-sched
Also, I think rml did a backport of the 2.5.X version of O(1);
I'm not sure if htat is in -ac or -jam as yet.
Rumor is that on some workloads MQ it outperforms O(1), but it
may be that the latest (post K3?) O(1) is catching up?
