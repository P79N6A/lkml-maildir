Here is a histogram I generated using realfeel2.  This should provide
better data than my jackd histograms because the latter are dependent on
the ALSA driver, jackd's design, etc.
I had to modify the amlat utilities to use usecs instead of msecs, this
is a very good sign. ;-)

I find the two smaller spikes to either side of the central spike really
odd.  These showed up in my jackd tests too, I had attributed them to
some measurement artifact, but they seem real.  Maybe a rounding bug, or
some kind of weird cache effect?
