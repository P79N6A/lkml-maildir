If you're waiting for a PLL to settle, it could vary tremendously.
Is there some way to sense the disconnect state and put in a proper
delay e.g. 10 microseconds when it is sensed?  I'd guess the
disconnect state isn't encounted much under system load, which is the
only time you really care about fast timer interrupts.

It's possible that hammering it will consume more bus power and push
a stabilising PLL and/or power supply a bit far.
If it's purely marginal timing, then doing fewer reads just means
you'll hit the marginal state less often, not avoid it completely.
