Sorry, I noted in the comments that that's only for the DEBUG patch, and
you shouldn't apply that, except when attempting to up the NR_CPUS count
for testing.  (I should perhaps just quit submitting it? ;-)
As a side note, soon we should be able to up NR_CPUS and not worry about
stack overflows.
Thanks,
Mike
