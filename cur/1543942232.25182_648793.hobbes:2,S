Or maybe I'm just so damn tired that I should sleep instead of trying to fix
this Makefile for 117 time.
You are right that it should read:
-$(addprefix $(src)/,$(aic7xxx-y:.o=.c)): $(obj)/aic7xxx_seq.h $(obj)/aic7xxx_reg.h
-$(addprefix $(src)/,$(aic79xx-y:.o=.c)): $(obj)/aic79xx_seq.h $(obj)/aic79xx_reg.h
+$(addprefix $(obj)/,$(aic7xxx-y)): $(obj)/aic7xxx_seq.h $(obj)/aic7xxx_reg.h
+$(addprefix $(obj)/,$(aic79xx-y)): $(obj)/aic79xx_seq.h $(obj)/aic79xx_reg.h
But for now the distinction between src and obj is purely for documentation
as they have the same value - also when O= is used.
So it should work anyway.
If you use M=... (or SUBDIRS=...) I think it matters but this
is not the case for this in-tree driver in normal usage situations.
I will test some more tomorrow and if feedback from Adrian is positive I
will submit the hopefully last update to this Makefile to Linus.
[I need to test if it can generate the files using the aicasm tool for instance).
