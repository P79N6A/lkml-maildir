Agreed.  But the CPUs would have to refer to a fine-grained synchronized
timebase or to some other variable in order to detect the fact that there
were in fact multiple different values for the same variable at the same
time (held in the different store queues).
If the CPUs looked only at that one single variable being stored to,
could they have inconsistent opinions about the order of values that
this single variable took on?  My belief is that they could not.
						Thanx, Paul
