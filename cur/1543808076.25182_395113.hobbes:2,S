Well the justification for the OOM Killer was that it keeps the system 
as a whole alive ..... cpusets are not vital to the system. Usually the 
folks using cpusets are very aware of the memory usage of their processes 
and I think they would hate that a random process be killed.
The obvious case is that someone starts a process that allocates 
large amount of memory while other processes are already running.

Typically the worst offender is who just asked for the page.

I definitely agree with you. Lets at least keep it from doing harm as much 
as possible.

mbind to one node. Allocate on that node until you trigger the OOM killer.
