I see no _overriding_ reason to wait. This is a technical measure which
they'd need to deliberately work around, and which might make the case
easier to win -- but I think I'm on record already as planning to sue

technical measure to prevent them.
The only reason it hasn't happened so far is because lawyers make me
itch.
