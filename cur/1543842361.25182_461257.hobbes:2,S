No, that would be a complete PITA and so far no arch maintainer wants to 
do this.
gcc cannot do arbitrary transformations, the result has to be the same 
according to the standard and since the standard functions we provide are 
standards compliant (modulo bugs, minus fp support) there is no problem. 
It's possible that gcc generates a call to a function we don't provide, 
but the resulting link failure is hard to miss.
bye, Roman
