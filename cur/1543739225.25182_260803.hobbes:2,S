Hi,
going from udev-036 to 038 on gentoo resulted in following problem for me:
I load the nvidia module via /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6. With 
udev-036 the device nodes eventually were created fast enough so that 
kdm could start. With udev-038 it is not the case. The boot ends at the 
log-in, and I have to manually start kdm.
What is the right way to get this going?
Cheers,
Prakash
