No, because as was mentioned earlier in the thread, we want code to be
able to handle 0-sized allocations without special cases.  The goal is
that code like
	buf = kmalloc(nobj * obj_size);
	if (buf == NULL)
		return -ENOMEM;
should work fine if nobj happens to be 0.  But we do want to get an
oops if the code actually tries to read or write *buf.
