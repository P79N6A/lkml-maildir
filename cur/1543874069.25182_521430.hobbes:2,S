Hi Guillaume,
I understand your need for a working system, but the impression I get
is that this looks too much like yet another level of band-aid over a
broken architecture : AMD 7th and 8th generations, which does not give a
synchronized TSC.
The patch you suggest may work for scheduler purposes, but I wonder if
other parts of the kernel suffers from those TSC inconsistencies and
therefore would need to have this problem addressed differently that
smoothing the per-cpu frequency changes.
The approach you use implies hooking in the frequency change callback,
but it does not deal with frequency scaling due to temperature related
events, and does not, as I recall, deal with frequency scaling in halt
mode. It may also have problems with the values in the period of time
close to the frequency change.
For what it's worth, I would be tempted to use a "simple" approach for
these broken architectures, which would give a monotonic clock source.
Either :
- Use HPET or PM, as suggested by AMD. 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/4/173
  For some reasons, x86_64 does not use it for sched_clock, because it
  takes too long to access and is not enabled before the scheduler. I
  don't disagree about optimizing for broken hardware, except when it
  implies multiple layers of band-aids.
- I am currently developing a completely monotonic clock source for
  tracing purposes on those AMD systems. It uses LOCKed atomic operation
  to update the "global" last_tsc value to the count of the CPU with
  highest TSC value at each TSC read and increments this global TSC
  count of the amount of cycles necessary to read the TSC by the other
  CPUs to generate a logical clock. I also plan to update this global
  last_tsc every timer tick to give a higher bound to time accuracy.
  This is a workaround that :
  - Does not scale perfectly (uses locked atomic operation, shares a
    variable between the CPUs, therefore causes contention)
  - Takes about 225 cycles per TSC read instead of 181.
  - Requires an IPI every timer tick.
  - Give a worse case time precision of 1/HZ (1ms to 10ms).
  - Can get a much better time precision by sending an IPI to each CPU
    in a special read operation if necessary, but this is awfully slow.
  - Gives the time in cycles since boot, but does not match perfectly a
    conversion from cycles to ns, since the scaling value is inaccurate.
Therefore, depending on your needs (accuracy vs granularity), I would be
tempted to use either the HPET or my monotonic TSC workaround.
Regards,
Mathieu
