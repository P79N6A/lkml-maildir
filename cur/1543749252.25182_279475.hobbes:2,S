This issue has gone from the utility of the ioctl in question (which has
been discussed in detail on the list) to now outright rejection of the
driver ioctls. If this is the idea, drivers would need to consciously move
the driver only ioctls to sysfs. Which may be good for simple ioctls like
these but might now be elegant for complex transfers. So, IMO, drivers need
both of the interfaces and should make a good judgment call on services
provided by each interface.

The ioctl in question has been discussed in detail and was deemed
appropriate ioctl to provide important service to the management
applications for device hot plugging. Schedules are one side of the story,
but we must not overlook the importance of the reason to have this ioctl in
the first place. If there are other preferred ways to implement the similar
functionality, we would be more than happy to consider that.
