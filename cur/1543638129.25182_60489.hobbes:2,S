Gotit! Thank you, I'll give this a cautious try as soon as I have a system
I can boink, perhaps this weekend, definitely if it rains and I don't have
to do things outside;-)

Do the drivers currently do a bus reset after a device fail? That is,
after the last attempt to access the device before returning an error? If
the retries cause the failed sevice to hang the bus again, the final reset
might give function on other drives. Clearly that's not a cure-all, and I
think it would have to be at the driver level. I know some drivers do try
a reset, because they log it, but I don't remember if they do a final
reset when they give up.

No question there, but not always shoddy... I got some drives from a major
vendor I'd not name without asking a lawyer, and until I got a firmware
upgrade two weeks later they were total crap. It would seem that Linux
does some thing which Win/NT don't in terms of command sequences. I'm
guessing an error in the state table stuff, but {vendor} wouldn't say.
