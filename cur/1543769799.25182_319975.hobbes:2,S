You don't need a copyright notice even in the US any more, afaik. The US 
signed the Berne convention late, but did sign it.
You own copyright on anything you write, as logn as it's copyrightable in 
the first place, of course. Not everything is.

  suspect that in practice you'd have better made your copyright known
  some way. ]
And no, I'm not a lawyer, and I don't play one on TV. And I don't see why 
people discuss technicalities.
