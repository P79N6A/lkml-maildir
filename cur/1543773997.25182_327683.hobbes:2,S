I fail to see this as an important distinction:
 - ext2    decides what "plugin" to use based on parameters supplied to
 the file creation system call;
 - reiser4 decides what "plugin" to use based on parameters supplied to
 the file creation system call.

If you are talking about S_IFMT bits they are just a relic to keep user
level happy (yes, VFS does few S_ISFOO checks here and there, but they
all can be replaced with checks for appropriate operations being
non-NULL). Nothing prevents file system from rolling forward whatever
exotic objects it wants.

This is important, but it doesn't depend on whether file system has
additional layer if indirection below VFS operations. If file system
wants to support extended object types, additional parameters have to be
somehow communicated from the user level during object creation. But:
 - this is necessary even if file system has no "plugins" below VFS
 operations;
 - this doesn't necessary means changing VFS. For example, these
 parameters can be set on parent directory (this is how ACLs were
 integrated into POSIX).
