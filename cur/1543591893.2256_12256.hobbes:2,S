ioctl has actually 4 semantics:
command only
command + read
command + write
command + rw-transaction
Separating these would be a first step. And yes, I consider each
of them useful.
command only: reset drive
command + rw-transaction: "dear device please mangle this data"
   (crypto processors come to mind...)
The other two are obviously needed and already accepted by all of
you.
Hotspots: crypto hardware or generally DSPs.
