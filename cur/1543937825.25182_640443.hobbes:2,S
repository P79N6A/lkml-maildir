The gensyscall.c program is what I would call a set of unit test, btw.
This is not the same as a use case, which would include information  
about the application environment, its users, a detailed description  
of current system behavior, and some discussion of alternatives for  
improving it (including doing nothing).
A test case is written in a programming language, a use case is  
written in a natural language.
