What I mean by "depends on" is that for what you are attempting to patch,
your architecture has an in-tree dependency on something that hasn't been
discussed. It's more than a bit backwards to push the follow-up bits before
even getting an Ack on the changes you want to make in the common code.
The fact you have other options is great, so at least you haven't shafted
all of your git kernel users, but that's not the point. You should not be
pushing things in to the kernel that have dependencies on API changes
that may or may not be merged, especially when you're breaking the entire
kernel for your platform (and the ability to bisect for those users) in
the process.
