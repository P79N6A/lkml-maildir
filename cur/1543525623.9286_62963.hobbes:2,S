Excuse me ?
Where does it say that an Itsy costs several thousand $ ? The LART (see
.sig) is very similar to the Itsy, and its prototypes didn't cost more than
US$600 each. Even in small volume (qty100) this drops down to $250. And
that's for a machine that's heavily overqualified to do the tasks that
Larry was talking about.
My estimate is that adding a minimal StrongARM+100BT to a disk drive adds
$40-$50 maximum to the BOM cost at volumes >10k; less if you go for higher
quantities and stuff an SA-1 (or other fast core) and integrated 100[0]BT
into an ASIC.
JDB.

dominating factor in the PCB area calculation]
