Well, right now with the mainline scheduler it works fine. The player gets 
more CPU time than the encoder. It was when I switched to -ck kernel (with a 
fair scheduler) that it didn't work correctly, that's why I asked about 
this "fair" concept in the first place.
I guess once a fair scheduler goes mainline they will adapt things to work 
correctly again.
