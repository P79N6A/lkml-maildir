Actually, as part of my security work, I've got a prototype patch which
makes "normal user abilities" capabilities. Currently the prototype just
has "exec priv binary" and "ptrace" as capabilities, but even with just
two new capabilities, system security can be considerably enhanced.
Imagine the frustration of an attacker who gets a nobody shell, then finds
he can't use his favourite exploit for <insert name of suid root program
here>.
