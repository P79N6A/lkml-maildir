Yup, I'm aware of that. I was thinking more about the NFS asynchronous
writebacks: In the write gathering / NFSv3 case, the requests spend a
certain amount of time in limbo for their sins waiting to be flushed
out. These requests will not be cleared by the rpc_killall_tasks,
since RPC doesn't know about them, and hence they may be a problem if
something decides to flush them, in particular since the RPC client is
likely to be dead...
Seems that stock linux-2.2.x should be more or less OK though, since
there each writeback request is immediately turned into an RPC
request.
Cheers,
