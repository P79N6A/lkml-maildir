A patch for %Z for size_t (please do pointer differences too!) would
be much appreciated. I currently have ugly casts to unsigned long in a
few places in my drivers. They should also go into 2.2.x and 2.0.x to
be useful to kernel-version-independent driver code.
I imagine it will be some time before all size_t and ptrdiff_t code
has been fixed.
Thanks,
Giuliano Procida.
