Patched kernel compiles, boots, and runs the selinux testsuite as
expected, with just the (last component) name= info in the avc message
and the path= info in the associated syscall audit message.  I don't
mind introducing an AUDIT_AVC_PATH type if desired, but saw that there
was an AUDIT_AVC definition that wasn't being used yet.  What do people
want?  Would we end up adding separate types for each kind of auxiliary
audit data provided by the AVC, or just put them all into a single top-
level type with possibly a subtype to distinguish.
