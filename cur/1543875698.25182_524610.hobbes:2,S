It's ata_read_native_max_address_ext failing, and it's fine if I use 
ahci rather than ata_piix, so I'll just chalk this up to Apple's 
firmware being broken (again) and putting the hardware into some sort of 
"I can't believe it's not piix" mode and see what I can do about 
ensuring we use ahci instead.
