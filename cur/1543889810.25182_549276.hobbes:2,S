I went back and read the thread leading up to this patch and I am of
the opinion that John's approach (adding more stubs to
dma-mapping-broken.h:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=117219377712232&w=2
)  is needed in
_addition_ to this Kconfig option.  In my particular case I have an
API with a DMA and a non-DMA path written in such a way that the DMA
path can be compiled away.  Without dma-mapping-broken.h support the
API is unnecessarily forced to violate point 2 of
Documentation/SubmittingPatches (#ifdefs are ugly).
In other words let CONFIG_HAS_DMA prevent pure DMA code from being
built, but do not preclude "clever" implementations from calling
broken code.
If there are no objections I plan to resubmit John's changes with the
addition below, which allows CONFIG_HAS_DMA=n architectures to delete
their respective dma-mapping.h file.
