You have the wrong mailing list:
1. You are using proprietary drivers (ndiswrapper and madwifi both have binary only parts).
2. The network developers read netdev@vger.kernel.org
Sounds like you have a TCP corrupting firewall that mangles the window scaling.
This is a known issue with buggy middleboxes that can not be fixed in Linux without
limiting performance.  Complain to the middlebox vendors or IETF.
