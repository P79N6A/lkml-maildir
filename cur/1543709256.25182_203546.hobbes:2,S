I've narrowed it down to the uhci_hcd module -- all the rest can
be compiled in or as modules, doesn't matter.
Just in case I was vague:  the Zip drive works great regardless --
it's only the ps2 mouse which is affected by this weird problem.
No cursor movement at all if the Zip is plugged in during boot.
ASUS A7V8X mobo, in case it matters:
00:10.0 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6202 [USB 2.0 controller] (rev 80)
00:10.1 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6202 [USB 2.0 controller] (rev 80)
00:10.2 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6202 [USB 2.0 controller] (rev 80)
00:10.3 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. USB 2.0 (rev 82)
Things that make no difference to this problem:  ACPI, PnP, udev versus devfs.
I'm also using 2.6.4-rc1.  I have not tested for this bug on any 2.6.x prior
to a week ago, but I have tried recent 2.4.x kernels and I do not see this bug
with them.
Thanks for any suggestions!
