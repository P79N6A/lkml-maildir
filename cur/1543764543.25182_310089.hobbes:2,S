The ia64_switch_to() code includes a section that can change a pinned
MMU mapping (when the stack for the new process is in a different
granule from the stack for the old process).  The code beyond the ".map"
label in arch/ia64/kernel/entry.S includes the comment:
.map:
        rsm psr.ic                      // interrupts (psr.i) are already disabled here
I don't think that it would be sufficient to merely add psr.i to this rsm
(and to the ssm 15 lines above).  That would leave a window where we could
take an interrupt, but not be sure that the current stack is pinned.
