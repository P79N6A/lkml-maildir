The machine has 2 IDE controllers, the standard onboard controller of the
VIA chipset and an onboard Promise IDE Chip which can be switched to RAID0/1
mode. I use the Promise controller in standard IDE mode.
A DVD-ROM and a CD-Writer are connected to the Promise chip as hde and hdg.

No, there are no other error messages prior to the extracted one.
Best regards, Peter.
