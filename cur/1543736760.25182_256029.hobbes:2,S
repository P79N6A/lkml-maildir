Works here on SMP/SMT (P4/HT). However I have a probable off-topic
complaint about the -mm4 (both vanilla and VP):
My Wacom Graphire USB mouse wheel stopped to work properly, at least on X.
Trying to scroll with the mouse wheel just causes flicker and the view
stucks in the same position.
Again this was surely introduced on -mm4.
Bye now.
