Please, let's just leave the four we have and let
the driver just allocate increasing minor numbers.
If anyone has a product with more than 4 UARTs,
they will have to figure out what to do with the
additional minors.
We are making a very complicated problem
out of nothing.  This hasn't caused any problems
in the past, and changing the existing names and
minors will cause problems for everyone today.
Just leave it alone, fix up the documentation,
and have the driver print some warning if it
allocates more than 4 UARTs.
Thanks.
