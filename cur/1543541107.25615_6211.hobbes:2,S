Subject: [PATCH] partial fix for Thinkpads and suspend
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Linus,
One of the recent changes to the power management code was to disable
interrupts from just before suspending until after the drivers have
been notified of the resume.  This broke the Thinkpads.  They do not
completely resume anymore.  It turns out that I have just been presented
with a Thinkpad (for work), so I need to fix this :-)
Please apply the enclosed patch.  It is not quite completely correct,
but at least the Thinkpads (which are the only laptops that require
the CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS option) will resume.  The window we open
is small, but it may be that we will still get interrupts for devices
that need to be reinitialised first.
A more complete solution is for each device to disable its interrupt
before the suspend (I think).
Cheers,
Stephen
