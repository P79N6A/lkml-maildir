It can.  I had a drive crash on my server a couple of months ago, and I had ext3 
errors show up before the syslog filled up with the ide errors.  The hard disk was 
only 1 1/2 years old.
If the bad sectors happen where directory inodes are written, your directory 
structure will be turned into swiss cheese.  That will *definitely* cause ext3 
errors, and dump you (in Red Hat systems, at least) to a shell on reboot.

You might not have any luck.  After fsck -f, I thought I had saved the drive, 
copied everything that was left onto another machine, and found that most of the 
larger files had holes in them - mp3's had skips, jpegs were completely corrupted, 
etc.
That's what made me get a backup FireWire drive... :)
