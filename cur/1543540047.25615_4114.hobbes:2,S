It sounds sophisticated, but you know what is happening if you want to change
access of some crowded directory (like "/usr", or "/home" on some systems)?
Every ACL of every file within this directory gets updated...
Does nobody consider dynamic inheritance? Because when accessing a file, as
access of every path component needs to be checked anyway, dynamic inheritance
should not pose significant overhead, but is a LOT faster for updating, and
probably smarter regarding disk space. The default ACL for a file would be
"inherit all rights from parent", and for files with link count = 1, this ACL
metadata can be left out entirely (because it's the suggested default.)
(Leaving out the ACL metadata, may result in omitting checking for access,
probably making dynamic inheritance faster than static inheritance.)
What do you think?
