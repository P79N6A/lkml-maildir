I would need people to help me converting more subsystems to this new scheme.
In particular all exports that are only used by a single module are direct 
candidates for a namespace. For the others it has to be checked by someone
who knows the particular subsystem well.
e.g. for SCSI it would be nice to put the symbols only used by sd/sr/sg etc.
into a namespace.
