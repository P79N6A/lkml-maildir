Should be OK, except that with 2.2 you'll need to get hold on dentry
from original fs instead of vfsmount (unfortunately, that can't be
done same way for both - 2.2 doesn't have vfsmount tree and in 2.4
holding dentry without holding vfsmount is a one-way ticket to hell -
umount() will be unhappy). However, version-dependent part should be
very small. Something like
struct superblock *grab_super(name, p)
char *name;
void **p;
{
	struct nameidata nd;
	int err = 0;
	*p = NULL;
	if (path_init(name, 0, &nd))
		err = path_walk(name, &nd);
	if (err)
		return ERR_PTR(err);
	*p = mntget(nd.mnt);
	path_release(&nd);
	return (*(struct vfsmount**)p)->mnt_sb;
}
for 2.4 and
struct superblock *grab_super(name, p)
char *name;
void **p;
{
	int err = 0;
	struct dentry *dentry;
	*p = NULL;
	dentry = lookup_dentry(name, NULL, 0);
	if (IS_ERR(dentry))
		return (struct super_block*)dentry;
	*p = dentry;
	return dentry->d_sb;
}
for 2.2 should do the trick -
	master_sb = grab_super(ext2root, &sb->u.ext2meta_sb.holder);
	if (IS_ERR(matser_sb))
		/* fail */
	sb->u.ext2meta_sb.master = master_sb;
	...
should be OK (to release the master sb you'll need to do dput() or mntput()
of sb->....holder in 2.2 and 2.4 resp., indeed). I wouldn't try to port
that to 2.0, though...
