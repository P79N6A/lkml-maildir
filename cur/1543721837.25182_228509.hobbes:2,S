/proc/<pid>/wchan reports the function name as a string.  You're arguing that 
doing that in the kernel is the wrong thing to do, right?  If so, it would 
make sense to change its behavior.  Either way, I guess we can fix top to 
use /proc/<pid>/stat instead, and lookup symbols in an external System.map 
file.
