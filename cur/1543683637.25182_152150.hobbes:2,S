The A7V8X Deluxe motherboard has an integrated Broadcom 5702 controller.
It works using the bcm5700 driver available for the 2.4 kernels, however
that driver has some drawbacks (for example it initializes itself with a
fixed IP address). The tg3 driver has been mentioned here as its
replacement in 2.6. This driver can't find the MAC address of the
interface and aborts.
Has anyone got this ethernet interface working with the 2.6 drivers?
