I presume you are talking of hard-limiting each group to 100 MB here. In
which case, wont the 100MB (reserved for 10th group) be unutilized
untill 10th group is started (it may never be started for that matter!).
IMO it would be better to go and use that free 100 MB for reclaimable memory
and give that up when 10th group is started.
