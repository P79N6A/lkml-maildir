Sorry for being inresponsive. I was travelling and unexpectedly cut off
from the internet for some days.
While I agree in principle with the patch, I'm a bit uncomfortable. The
sys device suspend / resume ordering is not guaranteed and relies on the
registering order.
Jeff still seems to have problems with CONFIG_NO_HZ=n and it might be
caused by time keeping / tick management resume happening before the
HPET resume.
The required resume order is:
clocksources
timekeeping
clockevents
tick management
I'm not sure how to do this properly with the sys device facilities, but
I look into it.
/me goes off to understand the sys device magic.
