Hi, nfs locking stopped working on my file server running 2.6.15-rc5
today.  All clients that try locking operations hang, and I get the
message from the server:
lockd: couldn't create RPC handle for w.x.y.z
Also, the lockd process is unkillable, it looks like I'll have to
reboot.
The nfs mounts look like:
rw,nosuid,nodev,v3,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,intr,udp,lock
I've recently posted the kernel .config and dmesg for both the server
and clients for other bug reports.  For the server:
Message-ID: <20051129200013.GB6326@tau.solarneutrino.net>
and the clients:
Message-ID: <20051208022624.GA12944@tau.solarneutrino.net>
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
-ryan
