That's not true at all.  drivers/net/mii.c uses caller-provided locking 
in all cases, and there is nothing that prevents the common code from 
being called when the interface is down.
You are probably thinking about all the netif_running() checks found in 
the drivers, particularly in the ->begin() hook.
