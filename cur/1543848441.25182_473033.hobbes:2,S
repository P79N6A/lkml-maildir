Dave is right.  We've had a moratorium on new files under /proc/acpi for some time now.
The reason is that user-space should not know or care that something is supplied
by ACPI -- for on other systems it may be supplied by something else.
So new stuff should have generic names under sys -- even if on a large body of
systems the functionality beneath happens to be  supplied via ACPI.
an example of old is the brightness stuff under /proc/acpi and in various platform
specific drivers that scribble under /proc/acpi.
The corresponding example of new is the backlight I/F under /sys.
thanks,
