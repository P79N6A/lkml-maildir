But script written under different OS will work under linux without
change.

Script may specify /opt/new-language/bin/sth while your comp may not
have /opt directory tree at all - its ugly. This patch provides
centralized way to redirect interpreter execution.
It takes about 300 bytes (code overhead is smaller).

OK. But you have to change script. More: you have to know nature of a
problem (to remove '\r') - kernel will not tell you what is going wrong.
I know that functionality provided by this patch is limited, but it is
also very small.
