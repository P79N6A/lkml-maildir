Nobody scales better 1-4 CPUs, as indicated
by specweb99 - at 8 CPUs linux is OK, but not
as dominating....
When the high end specialists from IBM etc
can send in patches that enhance high end
performance without hurting the low end case
the numbers on 8-32 CPUs should really start
to shine. (There has been progress on that
front seen on lkml)
