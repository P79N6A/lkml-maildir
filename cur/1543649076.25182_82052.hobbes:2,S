Hey Davide,
I've always been a bit bothered by the need to specify maxfds in
advance.  What's the preferred way to handle the situation
where you guess wrong on the value of maxfds?  Create a new
epoll and register all the old fds with it?  (Sounds like
a good job for a userspace wrapper library.)
Regardless, thanks for pushing /dev/epoll along towards inclusion
in 2.5.  I'm looking forward to seeing it it integrated.
Even if the interface doesn't please everyone, the performance
should...
