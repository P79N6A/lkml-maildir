Subject: [PATCH] work_on_cpu: don't try to get_online_cpus() in work_on_cpu.
Impact: remove potential circular lock dependency with cpu hotplug lock
This has caused more problems than it solved, with a pile of cpu
hotplug locking issues.
Followup patches will get_online_cpus() in callers that need it, but
if they don't do it they're no worse than before when they were using
set_cpus_allowed without locking.
