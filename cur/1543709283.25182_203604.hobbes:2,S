Hi,
Polution of kgdb.h is definitely bad.
I tried this code from Tom's bitkeeper tree some time back. It was incorrect 
in two aspects hence I took only the minimal 'T' packet.
1. It assumes 32 bit pc and sp.
2. sp is not equal to ((char *)linux_regs) + SP_REGNUM * 4 on powerpc.
A full 'T' packet is still a good idea because it saves a 'g' packet in 
following cases:
1. gdb internal breakpoints, like module_event.
2. conditional breakpoints.
3. tracepoints.
In general we can report an arbitrary number of registers in a 'T' packet.  
Reporting registers other than PC and SP is effectively making 'T' packet 
into a 'g' packet.
Architecture dependent code is the right place to compose the PC and SP part 
of a 'T' packet. Given a pt_regs pointer, an architecture dependent function 
can compose PC number, PC value, SP number and SP value, all of which are 
arch dependent. How about architecture dependent function:
int make_pcsp_packet(struct pt_regs *, char *buffer)
