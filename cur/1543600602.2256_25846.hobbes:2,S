Hola:
2.4.4 was only trivially different from 2.4.3 so I skipped it.  2.4.5
was fine.  2.4.6 worked, but it lost a bit over 10 Mb/s in transmit
speed.  2.4.7 is broken.  I only tested on the alpha.

Curious. There are no hamachi driver differences between 2.4.9 and
2.4.9-ac
so the obvious question is which was the last version it did work ?
