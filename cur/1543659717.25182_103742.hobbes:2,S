I don't know enough about pci/cardbus, but in 
arch/i386/pci.c::pcibios_assign_resources, I can see the following :
if (!r->start && r->end)
                pci_assign_resource(dev, idx);
without testing the result and without freeing the ressource for all 
index if it fails on one index. So I don't know if your tests are necessary.
Beside that, testing (!r->start && r->end) seems to be more in sync 
with arch/i386/pci.c than testing r->flags
Thanks,
