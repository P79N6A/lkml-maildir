After building/playing around with some java apps on this version, something
seems to have gone weird with X or the kernel..
david@prototype:~$ ps aux | grep X
root       267  0.9 99.9 167640 4294965764 ? S<   06:50   1:11 /usr/bin/X11/X vt7 -auth /var/lib/gdm/:0.Xauth :0
System seems mostly fine, a bit slow..
Nothing special in logs

Would having the huge swap have anything to do with it? Needed it to install
oracle, but the blasted thing won't install anyway (Debian Sid).
