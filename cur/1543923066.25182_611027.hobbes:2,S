The BSD way: just add a number -- spin_lock_irq2()
Of course names are preferable.
	irq_spin_lock and irq_spin_unlock?
	spinirq_lock, spinirq_unlock?
	spin_lock_irq_disable, spin_lock_irq_enable (a bit verbose...)
Maybe the 'irq' part should be completely dropped from the name,
as with -rt extensions, it behaves differently, does not it?
(Or was it preemption?)
If it was a home project, I'd just flag it, if it was a business project,
I'd add the number, for Linux - ha, too big for me :-)
