   Why ?   You'll see init_page_count() is _only_ used from
   free_area_init_core(), when nothing else is using the VM
   yet.
   
Rik, not every architecture has a "counter" member of
atomic_t, that is the problem.  This is a hard bug, please
fix it.  It is an opaque type, accessing its' implementation
directly is therefore illegal in the strongest way possible.
   This exact same code has been in -rmap for a few months
   and went into 2.5 just over a week ago.  It doesn't seem
   to give any problems ...
Because I haven't pushed my sparc64 changesets yet, I'm doing
that tonight.
Franks a lot,
David S. Miller
