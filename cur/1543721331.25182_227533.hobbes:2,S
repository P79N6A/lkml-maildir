(repeating a privately posted question for all to respond)
Is a separate generic assymetric crypto API really necessary?
The cryptoapi usage model is to do a setkey before any encrypt or decrypt.
The setkey will be done with either a public or private key.  So there is no
need to have a public_key_alg with separate public_encrypt and
private_encrypt functions, as this distinction is implied at the setkey
time.  So our plan was to just add another crypto_alg for rsa_1024.
If anyone can point out why this is insufficient, then we will certainly
reconsider.
thanks,
