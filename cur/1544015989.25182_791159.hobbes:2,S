Subject: [PATCH 2/9] ftrace, ia64: explictly ignore a file in recordmcount.pl
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/13/26

From: Shaohua Li <shaohua.li@intel.com>
In IA64, a function pointer isn't a 'unsigned long' but a
'struct {unsigned long ip, unsigned long gp}'. MCOUNT_ADDR is determined
at link time not compile time, so explictly ignore kernel/trace/ftrace.o
in recordmcount.pl.
