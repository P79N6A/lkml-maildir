Hello !!!
I am running a 2.5.7 kernel and I have seen that there is something wrong 
with the sethdlc utility provide by 
	
ftp://ftp.pm.waw.pl/pub/Linux/hdlc/experimental/sethdlc.c.gz
It is causing a segmentation-fault in a command like:
	sethdlc e1 clock ext
and it is not configuring the interfaces with the desired parameters.
Will Halasa make the new sethdlc utility, or I will have to do it by myself ?
regards
