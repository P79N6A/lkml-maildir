Surely one can work around this in userland without inventing a load
of ad-hoc schemes in the kernel socket layer?
If one doesn't want to create a pool of sockets in order to service
the different threads, one can use generic methods such as
sys_readahead() in order to ensure that the relevant data gets paged
in prior to hogging the socket.
There is no difference between UDP and TCP sendfile() in this respect.
