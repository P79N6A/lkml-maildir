Who removes temporary files left behind when an application crashes?
I'd guess a daemon such as autofs could do a very good job here.

    bash$ ls -l /bin/mount 
    -rwsr-xr-x  1 root root 78504 May  4 23:34 /bin/mount
with proper policies in userspace it allows users to perform mounts.  
I'm not suggesting that the kernel should be unchanged, but really,
some of the proposals here, to put a hell of a lot of complexity into
the kernel it just wet dreams with not much thought of how it affects
the kernel.  What happened to the philosophy of putting complexity and
policy in userspace?  Look at khttpd and tux, they were hacks in the
kernel to try things out.  But what ended up in the kernel is generic
infrastructure that is useful for a lot more applications than just a
web server.  That is the right way to do things.
