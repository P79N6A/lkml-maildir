Now, the question is, can we trust a hard drive manufacturer support tech to know what they're talking about, with evidence to the contrary? :)
Somewhat like the 6 days i spent with a Cisco 802 and an 804, trying to get a link up.  Set it to National ISDN-1, dial 9 before dialing outbound number.  Connection comes up, but receive light is on, almost solid.  I figure I got the wrong switch type, so i give AT&T a call.  Bell tech comes out, finds out the line wasn't physically punched down into the block properly.
AT&T tells me it's a Northern DMS-100, and don't dial 9.  I set it up, can't get the connection to come up.  Invalid bear-caps.  I put the 9 back in, AT&T gives me a call, tells me to stop dialing 9.
Bell gets a call.  Turns out, it IS a National ISDN-1, and you're supposed to dial 9.  Seems that if you don't dial 9, it goes through AT&T's VOICE system.  For an ISDN call.  As you can tell, this doens't work.  :P  So after 6 days of learning more about cisco than I really wanted to, I get the link up.
Moral of the story?
Never trust a manufacturer. :)  That, and don't listen to your boss, when he keeps saying my Cisco Config must be bad, or the router is DOA.  Trust your instincts.

But what about the hard drive? You told you had WDC AC21600H. Can you PLEASE check waht CCC is marked on its label? PLEASE! I am trying to get an answer from WD on this, but not yet alas...
