i'm sorry ... i have no kt133/kt133a chipset ... i have a kt266a chipset
... i will look whether i could fiddle out how to deactivate the pci
master read caching in my board to look whether i get the problems to.
(that is the problem: i have no problems with the patch and can't
reproduce the problems on my board ... so i can't do testing stuff to find
out how to correct the problems)...
