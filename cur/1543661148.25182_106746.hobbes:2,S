If I don't have a second box to run a serial cable to, I probably don't have
a second box to run cat5 to, so netconsole probably doesn't do me any good.
crashdump might be usable, I'll have to look...

The real solution is probably to get Ingo's netconsole, the morse-panic patch,
the current serial-console support, and abstract it all into some
infrastructure with output hooks - netconsole, serial, morse, whatever.
But we're alledgedly in a feature freeze, so that's a 2.7-ish I guess...
