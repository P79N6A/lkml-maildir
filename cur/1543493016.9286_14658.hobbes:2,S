We have been able to get informix to work on 2.2 in shared memory mode,
but not in tcp mode, as we are setting up a central database server for
several other machines to connect to this won't work for us. I suspect it
has to do with the differences between the networking code in 2.2 vs 2.0
We have also not been able to get informix to work at all when configured
for multiple CPU's , including the case where we have a uniprocessor
kernel and enable the informix configuration option of "multiple virtual
CPU's" when informix is called they state that it does not support this
feature at this time (one more to add to the long list of features that
they do not yet support on linux)
