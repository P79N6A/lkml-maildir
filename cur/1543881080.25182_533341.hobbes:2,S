We know this in most cases.  This is information recorded, for
instance, in the mutex data structure.  You might have missed my "the
interface must be extended" part.  This means the PID of the owning
thread will have to be passed done.  For PI mutexes this is not
necessary since the kernel already has access to the information.

See above.  Believe me, I know how futexes work.  But I also know what
additional information we collect.  For mutexes and in part for
rwlocks we know which thread owns the sync object.  In that case we
can easily provide the kernel with the information.
