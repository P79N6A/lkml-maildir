Egads, this just makes the whole bad BUG_ON vs WARN_ON situation
worse. This adds yet another non-distinction, because the difference
between BUG_ON and WARN_ON has absolutely nothing to do with the
(perceived or actual) probability of the condition.
We've got plenty of evidence that BUG_ON and WARN_ON conditions -do-
happen. So choosing between BUG_ON and WARN_ON is choosing whether a
box should be forcibly killed or not and nothing more.
You've clearly got a use-case in mind where WARN_ON + !CONFIG_BUG
isn't doing what you want, please share it with us.
