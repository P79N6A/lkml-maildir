It's only via82cxxx, and is in quite recent versions in both the latest
Alan's and Linus's kernels ...

No, they only affected 686b's and newer chips.

The PnP stuff is for ISA PnP cards. If you don't have those, it's
irrelevant. When "PnP OS Installed" is set to "No", the BIOS does the
ISAPnP initialization. If it is set to "Yes", it skips that step. Linux
prefers to have the ISAPnP cards pre-initialized, though it can do it
all by itself.
