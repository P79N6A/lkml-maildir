Well, actually, the system runs (at least) unless I try to load
"ndiswrapper" which leads to a kernel panic.
I tried to bring the issue to the ndiswrapper ML but I doubt that
ndiswrapper is faulty.
I can reliably predict the crash. If the clock (and all other time based
events) are too fast, then modprobing ndiswrapper will lead to a system
crash, just like mounting a CDROM will fail.
I think the clock speed and other effects are just signs, not the cause
of the problem. What I'd like to determine is what would need to be done
to avoid the root cause, or maybe if there is anything that can be done
in Linux to avoid that?
I just tried "acpi_fake_ecdt" but that leads to a immediate kernel
panic.
Ps: Given the crash (Machine check exception), the sleep option seems to
have no effect.
Thanks,
Olivier.
