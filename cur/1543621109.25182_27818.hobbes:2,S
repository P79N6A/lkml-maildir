Applying a patch like s/virt_to_bus/virt_to_phys/ makes it more
difficult to find the right spots to change later.
Patience :)  We will fix i810_audio and the other notables.  As I noted
in the other message just now, i810_audio and bttv fixes are already
floating around, and hopefully should appear on lkml or in a Linus
pre-patch soon...

I can tell you it is -not- a waste of time.  It's not a waste of time
when a vendor appears out of nowhere, having copied a driver of yours. 
Since you did it right(tm), the vendor driver is portable, even though
its original source was for x86-only hardware.  It's not a waste of time
when people copy your code or learn from your code.  It's not a waste of
time when spiffy new x86 hardware appears that has useful IOMMU stuff,
making a driver's use of the PCI DMA API automatically useful for that
new hardware.
I agree with Linus that there is little motivation for someone to
continue patching a driver, after they have fixed the problem they set
out to fix.  But that is not the same as saying driver portability is
worthless... far from it.
