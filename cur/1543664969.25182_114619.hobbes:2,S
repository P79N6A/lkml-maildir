Hello Miyazawa-san,
   I submit the patch to let the kernel support ipv6 ipsec again.
   It is able to comple ipv6 as module.
   This patch incldes a couple of clean-up and
   changes of function name.
Excellent work.
I have comments, but they are very minor and can wait.
I will apply your patch after basic build testing.
The next large task will be to abstract out more common
pieces of code.  There is still quite a bit of code duplication
between v4 and v6 xfrm methods,
Thank you!
