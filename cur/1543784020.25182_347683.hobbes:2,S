I am developer of ndiswrapper and just caught up with this discussion. I am
interested in providing private stack for ndiswrapper. I am not familiar
with linux kernel internals to understand your proposal. Could you give me
details please: If you can give a rough sketch of idea, I can implement it.
Better yet, if you (or anyone else) can provide an implementation (not
necessarily against ndsiwrapper, but a proof of concept), it will be
greatly appreciated - this should also help any other projects that need
more than 4k stack.
Thanks,
Giri.
