Subject: [patch 18/43] resources: skip sanity check of busy resources

2.6.28-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Arjan van de Ven <arjan@linux.intel.com>
commit 3ac52669c7a24b93663acfcab606d1065ed1accd upstream.
Impact: reduce false positives in iomem_map_sanity_check()
Some drivers (vesafb) only map/reserve a portion of a resource.
If then some other driver comes in and maps the whole resource,
the current code WARN_ON's. This is not the intent of the checks
in iomem_map_sanity_check(); rather these checks want to
warn when crossing *hardware* resources only.
This patch skips BUSY resources as suggested by Linus.
Note: having two drivers talk to the same hardware at the same
time is obviously not optimal behavior, but that's a separate story.
