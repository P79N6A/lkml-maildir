Hello David,
Thanks for taking a look at this.

You're right, that makes the interface more clumsy. +1 for
the disadvantages.  And of course solution (d) also suffers
this problem.

Yes, true.  Solution (b) would also be relatively easier (for me)
to implement.

Yes.  (And the same for option (d).)

My gut feeling would be to say that closing the timerfd would not
remove the underlying timer (so the timerid would remain valid).
One could even do things like recreating a file descriptor
for the timer using another timerfd() call.  
But now that raises the question: what are the semantics if
timerfd() is called  more than once on the same timerid? 
Perhaps a read() from any one of them (destructively)
reads the expiration count, as though one had read from a 
dup()ed the file descriptor.  All in all, solution (c) 
starts to look overly complex, and maybe suffers from 
various dirty corners in the API.  (Solution (d) feels 
slightly better, because the creation of the file descriptor
and the timerid are integrated into a single call, and the
fact that it integrates with an existing API, but
it still has the limitation you describe above.)
Cheers,
Michael
