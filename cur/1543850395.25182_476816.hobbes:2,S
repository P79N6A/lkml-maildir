Well this means also that sys_mbind and sys_set_mempolicy are also
broken because these functions also use get_nodes().
Fixing get_nodes() to do the proper thing would fix all of these 
without having to touch sys_migrate_pages or creating a compat_ function 
(which usually is placed in kernel/compat.c)
