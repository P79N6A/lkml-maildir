Subject: [PATCH] [m32r] Upgrade to 2.6.7 kernel
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
I would like to send a 2.6.7 kernel patch for Renesas M32R processor.
Would you consider to include this patch to the Linux kernel tree?
Patch information to the stock 2.6.7 kernel is placed as follows:
- m32r architecture dependent portions (arch/m32r, include/asm-m32r)
  
http://www.linux-m32r.org/public/linux-2.6.7_m32r_20040819.arch-m32r.patch
In this release,
* Clean up
  All workaround code for old m32r-linux-gcc are completely removed
  from the architecture-independent portions.
* Add new drivers
  - AR (artificial retina) camera is newly supported.
    AR camera module: Renesas M64278E-800, VGA(640x480 pixcels)

  - Frame buffer device driver for LCD panel/CRT display is supported.
    Display controller: EPSON S1D13806
  These drivers are put into architecture-independent portions, 
  so they are not included in the above patch.
