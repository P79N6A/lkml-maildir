The last few days, I've been getting a bunch of messages
like:
Jan 11 07:37:21 calvin kernel: iput: inode 09:00/14189 still has locks!
Jan 11 07:37:23 calvin kernel: iput: inode 09:03/996435 still has locks!
Jan 11 07:37:36 calvin kernel: iput: inode 09:03/1195010 still has locks!
Jan 11 07:37:38 calvin kernel: iput: inode 09:03/541708 still has locks!
Jan 11 07:37:38 calvin kernel: iput: inode 00:01/181600258 still has locks!
Jan 11 07:37:40 calvin kernel: iput: inode 09:03/1029138 still has locks!
I've looked at a number of the files that these represent, and
they are not files that are likely to be open and locked, so my
guess is that, since this is an SMP machine, maybe iput is getting
called on both CPUs with the same inode on (relatively rare)
occasions? I'm not sure that makes sense, though... I've only
seen the messages during periods of high atime activity (i.e.
running find or backups), and I'm not sure this is indicative
of a serious problem, but, since the code generating this is
inside an '#ifdef INODE_PARANOIA', it kinda makes me wonder...
System is a dual PPro 200MHz using a SuperMicro P6DNE, 512MB,
2 WDC AC418000D 18GB IDE drives using RAID1 for all filesystems.
Kernel is 2.2.13ac3 plus the ide-tape patch for an OnStream ADR
drive.
Also, I find the messages for inodes on dev 00:01 particularly
curious, since I have no /dev node with those numbers, and
linux/Documentation/devices.txt claims that major 0 is for unnamed
devices. Is this /proc or /dev/pts maybe? Is updating the atime
on such a pseudo-fs useful? Maybe these should be mounted ro...
Anyway, any insight you can provide me would be useful. Thanks.
