"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by
definition, not smart enough to debug it."

Sometimes cleverness can be even worse than ordinary abuse :-D.  If the
code gets added to the kernel, then it should be debuggable (or at least
easily comprehensible) by a significant chunk of kernel developers, or
it will cause more problems than it solves.  I think that a type-safe
list system _would_ be a good addition, but make sure you comment it
heavily enough to make it really obvious, even to those of us who are
less than brilliant (like myself).
Cheers,
