Well, we gained some code and a little bit of data, but
the BSS was cut in half which I think deserves noticing :-)
Also, he should analyze the amount of code that actually
gets executed for various tasks, comparing 2.4.x to 2.5.x
I'd take a half-meg code size hit if it meant that all
the normal code paths got cut in half :-)
