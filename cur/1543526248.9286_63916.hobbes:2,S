	I don't like the idea that a technical fact counts more 
	than humans habits. The main idea of a user friendly system is for
	that it adapts to the users behavior.
	this sounds like "if a guy drives too fast, then he should crash -
	no need for better breaks and stuff like ABS, 
	ESP, AirBag or whatelse...". THIS is unacceptable to me. 
	if users have different opinions, just offer options...
	a truly good system should be fool save. 
	especially cuz sometimes I am a fool as well ;-)
