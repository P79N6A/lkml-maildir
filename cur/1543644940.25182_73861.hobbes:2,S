In the olden days (at least I learnt that definition for a system
based on 3.x BSD), the "load average" is the number of runnable
processes (i.e. those that could do work if they got a slice of CPU
time) averaged over some period of time (1, 2, 5, 10 minutes).
So, naively speaking upgrading the box to the number of CPUs indicated
by an average load average will keep it well busy while getting the
maximum amount of work done. [Yes, of course this rule of thumb does
not include the considerable overhead were one to really implement
that scheme - we used this measure when scaling hardware well before
SMP x86 became competitively available].
For Linux the load average also seems to include some notion of the
fraction of time spent waiting for disk accesses; possibly Linux
counts the number of processes which are either Runnable or Waiting
for Disk.
I don't know the concise definition in Linux's case either.
So long,
   Joe
