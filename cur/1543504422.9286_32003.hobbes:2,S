Roger,
Perhaps you could get a copy of "Linux Device Drivers"
by Alessandro Rubini and get one of his example drivers.
Once you are processing the interrupt properly in
your device driver, you can send a SIGIO signal out 
of the bottom half handler to the process that has 
opened your device.
Mice drivers like drivers/char/busmouse.c illustrate
this technique. From the user process side this is
called asynchronous notification.
