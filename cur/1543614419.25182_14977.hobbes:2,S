Quick question: I see that there is support for both zero- and
one-based bitmasks (e.g. ffs() vs. ffz()). Are there technical
reasons to prefer one over the other? Or is this just a matter
of preference, or whatever lends itself best to the task at
hand? (It seems as though I have seen some reference to this
prevously, but I am unable to find anything in the archives.)
