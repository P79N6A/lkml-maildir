I got a little further with your -ide1 patch: it boots! However, it 
doesn't detect the drive at all:
[4294671.912000] ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:0f.1[A] -> Link [ALKA] -> 
GSI 20 (level, low) -> IRQ 177

[4294672.048000] scsi4 : pata_via
[4294672.078000] ata6: PATA max UDMA/100 cmd 0x170 ctl 0x376 bmdma 
0xD008 irq 15

[4294672.145000] scsi5 : pata_via
I suppose it might be a bit much asking that an ATAPI drive work on a 
PATA bus with lilbata, but hey... ;-)
Do you think I should try the generic driver?
Cheers,
Chris
