One more thing, I just found this message from July from someone
seeing a similar problem:
    
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/27/305
I am also running reiserfs, so I wonder if that has something to do
with this. Unlike the other poster, though, I am running an unmodified
kernel and have not seen the error he saw in the system logs.
Here's my output from /proc/meminfo in case it helps:
