This seems to me to be something that FUSE filesystems might well like,
too: I know one I'm working on would like to know the real size of the
original write request (so that it can optimize layout appropriately
for things frequently written in large chunks; the assumption being that
if it's written in large chunks it's likely to be read in large chunks
too).
