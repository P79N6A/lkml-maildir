hi,
I wanted to know how a user program/process can be put
to sleep by using the functions given in the kernel. I
will be calling the function not from user space but
from kernel space, i.e. from inside the kernel. I also
want to be able to start it again whenever required.
I went thru sched.c but couldn't figure out how to
make my own wait list.
Thanx in advance.
Anil
