I'm not prepared to say that there's no scenario where we *dont* care
how many links there are, as long as the file *does* get wiped when the
last one goes away.
The MH mail handler stores each message in a file - so a mail message is easily
stored in multiple folders by simply using multiple hard links.  I could
easily see having mail that I want to +s and go away when I remove it from
the last folder it was in....

Yes you could.  The question is whether that's a desired semantic or not.

As I said, ugly and murky....

Ahh.. but now you're suggesting a different model than "directory must
be empty".  Obviously more discussion of what we *want* it to do is needed ;)
