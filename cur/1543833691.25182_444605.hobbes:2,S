Well, speaking of that; there's been another thread recently that's  
splitting the properties of read-only between vfsmount and  
superblock.  So a read-only superblock implies read-only vfsmounts,  
but the following can create a read-only vfsmount for a writable  
superblock:
   mount --bind / /mnt/read-only-root
   mount -o ro,remount /mnt/read-only-root
So the readonly special case will go away.

One of the things I said earlier in this thread is that "Both  
filesystems _and_ processes should be first-class objects in any UID  
namespace".  In order to have sufficient access controls in the  
presence of _only_ a UID-namespace (as opposed to with full container  
isolation), you need to check against an object *and* the namespace  
in which it is located.  In some cases, the object is a file, which  
means that the inode, vfsmount, or superblock need a UID namespace  
reference.  Theoretically a you could implement per-file UID  
namespace pointers, but that would probably be incredibly  
inefficient.  IMHO, per-vfsmount gives the best flexibility and  
efficiency of the three.
In fact, it's strange to think about this in context with the rest of  
the namespaces that are being designed, but processes would  
ordinarily *not* have primary presence in a UID namespace if they  
weren't the target of UID-verified operations in and of themselves  
(EX: kill, ptrace, etc).  Otherwise they would just have a set of  
(namespace,UID,cap_flags) pairs to give them access to filesystems in  
specific uid namespaces.
