Two things with this.
1. there is no way to satisfy the firmware requirements currently
2. I thought I heard Linus state recently that makeing something only work 
as a module was unacceptable, officially stateing that modules are 
required and monolithic kernels aren't allowed anymore doesn't sound 
reasonable.
