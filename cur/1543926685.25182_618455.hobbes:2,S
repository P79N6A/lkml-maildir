3.8.5 in vol 3a "Page-Directory and Page-Table Entries With Extended
Addressing Enabled":
    The present flag (bit 0) in the page-directory-pointer-table entries
    can be set to 0 or 1. If the present flag is clear, the remaining
    bits in the page-directory-pointer-table entry are available to the
    operating system. If the present flag is set, the fields of the
    page-directory-pointer-table entry are defined in Figures 3-20 for
    4-KByte pages and Figures 3-21 for 2-MByte pages.
So I would assume this works on all current CPUs, but I can imagine that
some older/off-brand processors might get it wrong.

Yeah, I'm not so concerned about memory saving; I don't think there
would be any in practice.

I'm hoping to avoid special-casing anything, if I can help it, aside
from the normal 32/64-bit 2/3/4-level parameterising of the various
pagetable accessors.

Perhaps.  And there's the corresponding difference between 32 and 64 bit
on freeing a pagetable; 32-bit assumes the pgd destructor will free the
pmd, whereas 64-bit does it separately.  Even in the current 32-bit
code, there's separate handling for PAE and non-PAE.  I think it can all
be collapsed down in a reasonable way.

Yes, that is a bit awkward; it means that 32-bit PAE would need a
speparate pgd_populate.  But that seems like a smaller change than 1)
making 32-bit PAE pgd-alloc preallocate the pmd, and 2) making pmd_free
noop on 32-bit PAE, and 3) making pgd_free free the preallocated pmd. 
Perhaps 2 & 3 aren't necessary and can be the same as 64-bit.
I'll need to look into it more carefully.

Yep, absolutely.
