Maybe using sysfs? /sys/device/cdrom/param ?
But then you'd have to open another file :(
And what about somethink like:
cdrom_fd = open("/dev/cdrom", O_RDWR)
cdrom_param_fd = get_param_fd(cdrom_fd) /* a new syscall */
Now read/write to this param fd.
And two new entries in the struct file_operations:
write_param([same args as write])
read_param([same args as read])
