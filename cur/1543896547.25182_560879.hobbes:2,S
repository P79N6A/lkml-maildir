Indeed there are a few solutions to "fix" this implementation "bug",
of which reverse matching is one.  For reverse matching the policy
tables would become larger.   Reverse matching wouldn't need any
additional buffer for enforcement but would still fall back to d_path
for logging.
But we would still require the changes to the vfs and also a way to
safely walk the tree backwards.  So we would need to either export the
namespace semaphore or add a generic walking function which we could
pass a hook function to.
