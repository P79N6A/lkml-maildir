Ok, I'm back to this.
As I said mixing force_sig with the kthread infrastructure is a bad idea.
The proper short-term (aka 2.6.22) fix is to revert the kthread conversion
for this particular thread.  Just go back to what worked before.
Now the right fix is a lot more complicated and involved:
	Stop using blocking recvmsg (or read) in kernel threads!
If you look at what the other consumers of networking reads from kernel
threads do is they either use tcp_read_sock and hooks into the sk_ callbacks
which would be nice for high performance reads in cifs aswell, but probably
not the demultiplexer thread, or they use MSG_DONTWAIT to avoid this problems
and deal with the blocking behaviour on a higher level.
