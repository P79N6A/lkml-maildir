I have just bought a highpoint rocketraid 1540 card, which has some open source 
drivers. These are ment for 2.4, so when compiled under 2.6, they fail. The 
first error seems to be something about the irq-system (irq.h).
I would like to update the drivers to work under 2.6 aswell, and am wondering 
if this would be an enourmous task, or if it should be possible for some with 
no kernel programming experience.
Has anyone experienced the same, or know what kind of information I am looking 
for? The same problem arose when I compiled the open source driver a promise 
controller.
Thanks, Martin Tingstad.
