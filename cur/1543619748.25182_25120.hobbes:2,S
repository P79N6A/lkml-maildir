Well, I'm more or less in agreement here, especially when working with
small embedded devices which have a few (say 16 or 32) MB of RAM for
EVERYTHING, kernel, userspace AND filesystems.
However, I wonder if we can't have the linker remove unnecessary and
unreferences objects, functions and variables?
    What I'd much rather see if this is an issue is:
    bool	'Do you want to customise for a very small system'
_IF_ the linker can remove things, it would simplify this too --- we
could if a few important places produce code slightly differently to
favour speed over size and not reference various things.  Also, the
above option would turn-off inlining as that seems to makie quite a
difference at times (BTW, I'm not sure about this, but it seems gcc
and C99 don't agree with static/extern inline semantics?)
