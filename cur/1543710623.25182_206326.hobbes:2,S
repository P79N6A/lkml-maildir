Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Highpoint-Tech Plugin 0.0.1 for EVMS 2.3.0

hi,
...so here comes 0.0.1! i have changed the device manager id to 3 
because of Kevin Corry suggested this and also added more pci-ids. you 
can override the id scan be setting "biosraid.ignore_pci_ids" to "1". 
but you still need the proper raid signatures on your disks to get a 
raid volume.
basic read/write tests on a fat partition worked fine, but i cannot do 
more right now. the fan of my graphiccard is broken and i replaced the 
cooler with cpu heatsink and attached it with a string to the board. 
looks pretty crude!
Changelog:
* use new list API
* migrate to evms 2.3.0
* support for HPT 370, 370A, 302, 371, 375, 372N chipsets
* remove disk if it cannot be added the discover() output_list
* make all global variables static
* add boolean "biosraid.ignore_pci_ids" config option to optionally
ignore the pci vendor and device ids of the ide controllers
* changed EVMS_DEVICE_MANAGER ID to 3
TODOs:
* access to the last sector (kernel 2.6 only)
* add mode raid levels
* create "whole disk" volume (currently only under .nodes)
* use sysfs for scanning
* more modular design to make it easier to add code for other controllers
* more testing
the next thing that i want to do is to implement the "whole disk" 
volume. it might be handy to have such a device for the grub bootloader 
and stuff. this also is a start for the last sector problem fix. the 
problem is that i should protect the sector #9 which contains the volume 
configuration. i do not think that it is possible to only write protect 
that sector but this would be a nice thing to do.
the patch that applies against evms 2.3.0 is attached...
greetings,
wilfried
