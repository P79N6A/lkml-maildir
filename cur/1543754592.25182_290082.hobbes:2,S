Subject: [PATCH 0/3] TIGLUSB Cleanups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello!
The tiglusb-driver was removed in 2.6.11-rc1.
Since then, references to it in other files have been kept, namely the 
following files:
    Documentation/usb/silverlink.txt,
    Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
    MAINTAINERS
This series of patches removes the silverlink.txt-documentation, and 
tiglusb-references in MAINTAINERS and kernel-parameters.txt.
The patches are diffed against 2.6.11-rc2-bk4.
Thanks,
Mikkel Krautz
