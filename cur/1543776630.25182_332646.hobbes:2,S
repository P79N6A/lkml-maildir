Using a function like
	return (x_old * 3 + x) / 4;
eliminates the need for a FIFO, and has similar (if not better)
properties to floating average, because its coefficients are
[ .25 .18 .14 .10 ... ].
Setting
	absfuzz[ABS_X] = some number;
activates the abovementioned filtering (with additional cutoff and fast
motion compensation) directly in input.c, which should eliminate a lot
of the code in the appletouch driver.
