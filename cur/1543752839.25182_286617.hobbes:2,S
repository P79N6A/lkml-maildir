Look at the end:
 #else
+int can_do_skas(void)
+{
        return(0);
-#endif
 }
+#endif
This dummy call could be inlined / moved, anyway this is not performance 
critical - it's anyway nicer to have such null defines in headers. I'll clean 
it up.
While checking your statement, I also discovered that here:
int mode_tt = DEFAULT_TT;
(where DEFAULT_TT is a macro depending on CONFIG options, which is always 0 
except if SKAS mode is disabled)
is ignored, because of the subsequent:
        mode_tt = force_tt ? 1 : !can_do_skas();
So we can probably get rid of DEFAULT_TT. I'll do this in the future.
