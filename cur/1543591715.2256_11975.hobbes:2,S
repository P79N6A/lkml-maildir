Ingo answered that specific question (and that had me puzzled for a while, too 
:-), but, in the future, you might want to look at UML if you have similar 
questions.  All this stuff works, and it's implemented in terms of the system 
calls that we all know and love, so you don't have to learn about a totally 
different piece of hardware in order to figure out what's going on.
