   Where's the UUID stored? On the drive? Wouldn't this cause problems with
   systems involving hot-swap drives? (Ie: If a scratch drive fails (as
   many have), and I go 'eek!', swap it and reboot, the drive UUID would be
   different and I'd also have to edit the fstab, right?)
The UUID is stored in the superblock, as is the volume label.  If you
have is a scratch drive which is freely interchangeable, then probably
the right thing to do is use a volume label of "scratch".  Then when a
disk fails, you simply run "mke2fs -L scratch" to make the ext2
filesystem with the scratch drive label on the new disk, swap it for the
failed disk, and reboot, and the right thing will happen.
