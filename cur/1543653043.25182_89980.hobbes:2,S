The Scsi_Host is already derived from struct device and since you need the 
dma_mask only for Scsi_Host, there is no need to expand the base class.
You can easily keep out the pci stuff if you do something like
this:
static inline void scsi_set_device(struct Scsi_Host *shost,
                                   struct device *dev)
{
        shost->dev = dev;
        shost->host_driverfs_dev.parent = dev;
}
static inline void scsi_set_pci_device(struct Scsi_Host *shost,
                                       struct pci_dev *pdev)
{
	scsi_set_device(shost, &pdev->dev);
	shost->dma_mask = pdev->dma_mask;
}
static inline void scsi_set_foobus_device(struct Scsi_Host *shost,
					  struct foo_dev *fdev)
{
	scsi_set_device(shost, fdev->dev);
	shost->dma_mask = fdev->foo_dma_mask;
}
You can even avoid Scsi_Host::dev completely if you make its only
remaining user (scsi_ioctl_get_pci) use host_sysfs_dev->parent.bus_id
instead.
