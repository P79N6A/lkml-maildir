	Now I did ;-) Why on the earth do you use *positive* values for
errors? I didn't finish wading through the directory-scanning logics
yet...

	Umm... I don't think that you'll hit something nasty with them
now, with the interface changes already in place. There was quite a bunch
of races in that area and half of filesystems missed (fs-independent)
checks. Now checks went to VFS and race-prevention did the same.

	It may mean nastiness with locking... (disclaimer - I didn't check
the actual code yet).
	ObknfsdCode: for non-directories we don't really need to go the
whole way to root. Unhashed dentry is more than enough to make all _file_
operations work. We need a hashed dentry (i.e. properly sitting in the
directory tree) only for directory fhandles...
