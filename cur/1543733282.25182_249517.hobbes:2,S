Hello,
1. I found that generic_forget_inode() calls write_inode_now() dropping 
inode_lock and destroys inode after that. The problem is that 
write_inode_now() can sleep and during this sleep someone can find inode 
in the hash, w/o I_FREEING state and with i_count = 0.
If such inode will be iget'ed, then it will be iput'ed once more later 
messing with the current iput(). So the inode can be cleared and 
destroyed twice.
2. Why there is no wake_up_inode() in generic_forget_inode() like in 
generic_delete_inode()? Looks like it is missing...
is it bugs in generic_forget_inode()?
Kirill
