Subject: Passthrough kernel module?

I am attempting to reverse engineer the interface for a piece of equipment
and it would be extreamly handy to have a kernel module that I could load
that I could then point a /dev entry and and have the module echo
everything that is sent to it (reads/writes/ioctls) to the real device,
recording the request and response.
Does such a module exist? Is there a better way to do this that I'm
missing?
