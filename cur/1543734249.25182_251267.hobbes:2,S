It is not just that ghash.h be removed.  It is that its contents have
to vanish.  That code shouldn't be anywhere.
There are good reasons to switch to rbtrees -
	I need some sort of low-O lookup
	there is no generic hash tree in the kernel
	rbtree is O(lg n) and it's generic
	rbtree is the only generic low-O lookup in the kernel that I see
I'm not in the fancy data structure business, so I'll stick with the
infrastructure that I find in the pool already, and rbtree is about it.

No, because currently there are no users of this.  We can get this tested
when UML starts mmapping into its page cache.

And inlining the grunge is right?
