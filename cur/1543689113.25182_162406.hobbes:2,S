The problem may be more serious. There are lots of
apps that use the old-style PTYs w/o any libc help.
a. because that's the historic BSD way
b. so the user can choose a specific pty
For example, there's a "remserial" program
that abuses a PTY for giving access to a
serial port over the network. Apps trying to
use the port work pretty well, without any need
for source code changes or new kernel drivers.
