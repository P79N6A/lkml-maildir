David,
As promised, my previous net/ipv4/raw.c signed/unsigned cleanup patch in 
little bits with explanations.
This series of patches cleans up signed versus unsigned variable use in 
net/ipv4/raw.c .
The patches are created incrementally on top of each other but will 
probably each apply (with a little fuzz) on their own out of order.
Please keep me on CC if you reply since I'm not subscribed to both lists 
the patches are send to (only to lkml).
