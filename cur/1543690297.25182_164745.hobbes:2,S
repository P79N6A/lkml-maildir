I found another such gem in Documentation/smp.tex, which was last updated
more than five years ago. Favorite quote:
 "A single lock is maintained across all processors. This lock is
  required to access the kernel space."
The whole file has only historic value and should probably be removed
or have a comment that it does not apply to the current code.
