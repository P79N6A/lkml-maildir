Jackson-san,
Thank you for the review.  I'll fix the bugs that you have found.

Ah, yes, we need to fix the bug in the cpuset code introduced by me...

I don't have any benchmark numbers yet, but the cpu controller code
will add some if statements and will not hold any spinlocks to the 
scheduler in the default configuration.

I have a few questions for your idea to make the design

Can the cpuset C have immediate children with meter_cpu=0?
Or should it be prohibited to set meter_cpu=0 for the immediate 
children of C?
If it is prohibited to set meter_cpu=0 for the immediate children 
of C, cpuset_create() needs a check whether the siblings are
metered or not.  If the siblings are metered, the newly created 
cpuset should also be metered.  And probably it is not allowed 
to set meter_cpu=1 if the sibling cpusets have meter_cpu=0.

Good idea, but I'd like to make sure...
Is it prohibited for any decendant of C's children to set meter_cpu=1 ?
