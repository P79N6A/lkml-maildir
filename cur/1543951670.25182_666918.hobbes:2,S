Isn't that just an issue of planing ? Those cpusets are not cast in stones are 
they. I mean yes users have setup A,B,C they way they did because that's what 
they needed. Now their plans/requirements have changed. They now want to also 
manage irqs via cpusets and in order to do that they need to replan/redo the 
partitioning.
In order to manager irqs the code has to change anyway because currently there 
is not way to do that via cpuset. The users would have two options:
1. keep all irqs in the top set and manage them individually via /proc
2. layout cpusets differently
btw I still do not see the "incompatibility" argument. Probably because I have 
no idea how the software you're talking about is designed. Are you saying that 
the software relies on a flat cpuset partitioning ? ie That it will brake if 
users add extra cpuset levels.

This sounds like an overkill and as you pointed out is not even clear how it'd 
work.
Looks like we have a trade-off here:
1. use simple "irq == pseudo-task" concept and potentially brake some existing 
software. We do have working solution.
2. come up with something that requires more complex irq management rules at 
the expense of complexity. We do not have working solution.
My vote goes for #1 :).

I think by natural you mean "compatible with existing sw". What is unnatural 
in extra levels of cpusets ? If I read cgroup/cpuset documentation it seems to 
imply that nested cgroups/cpuset are allowed.
