The filesystem-sized block (1<<i_blkbits) which straddles i_size should
have zeroes outside i_size.
There's one situation where it might not be zeroed out, and that's when the
final page is mapped MAP_SHARED and the application modifies that page
outside i_size while writeout is actually in flight.  We can't do much about
that.

It should be acceptable to assume that the final (1<<i_blkbits) block of
the file contains zeroes outside i_size.
And if it doesn't contain those zeroes, well, applications are able to read
that data already.  Although I wouldn't count that as a security hole: that
data is something which an application wrote there while writing the file,
rather than being left-over uncontrolled stuff.
