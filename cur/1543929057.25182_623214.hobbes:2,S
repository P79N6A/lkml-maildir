just curious, but this does sound like the c-state code has a bug...
independent of the sysfs thing, I think that really needs solving
Can you describe the behavior a little? Or provide information to the
degree that some of us can figure out how to tweak the algorithm..,.

in -mm there is.. the QoS stuff allows you to set maximum tolerable
latency. If your app cant take any latency, you should set those... and
the side effect is that the kernel will not do long-latency C-states or
P-state transitions..
