Modern desktop patterns are very different to older ones - the disk fill
is almost entirely continuous writes of large files (OGG, MP3, Movies
etc). In addition the default ext3 behaviour reserves the last part of
the disk for root - so usually it doesn't get below 5% free as only root
can steal that space.
Back when you had a 40MB /home the usage tended to be multiple parallel
writers, permanently at 90%+ (with a "please remove unused files" motd).
