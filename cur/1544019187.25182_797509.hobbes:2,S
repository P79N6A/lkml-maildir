Agreed, very similiar to the cgroup oom notifier patch that invokes the 
oom killer if there are no attached tasks waiting to handle the situation. 
In this case, it would be a configurable delay to allow userspace to act 
in response to oom conditions before invoking the kernel oom killer.  So 
instead of thinking of this as a userspace replacement for the oom killer, 
it simply preempts it if userspace can provide more memory, including the 
possibility of killing tasks itself.
