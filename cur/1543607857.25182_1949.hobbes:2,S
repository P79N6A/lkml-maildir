Well, maybe you like under testing things, but personally I don't.  What 
do you want a microoptimization?  Get real, you don't accept 
microoptimizations to networking code without numbers from the bigger 
picture.  So that means running real tests on real applications like 
Oracle or RHDB.  I think you'll find that the cross cpu case will be 
quite happy with a range flush.  Heck, it's the kind of IPI that can 
even legally be asynchronous.  Why don't you go do something useful 
like implement that instead of making me spend my time to correct other 
people's obvious mistakes?
