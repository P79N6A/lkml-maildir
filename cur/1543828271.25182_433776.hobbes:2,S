So, if I'm an userspace application trying to overcome nice or
scheduling class limitations, I can simply create a lot of mutexes, lock
them all, and get better scheduling ?-)
A better way would be to track what task holds what mutex, and when some
task tries to lock an already locked one, temporarily elevate the task
holding the mutex to the priority of the highest priority task blocking
on it (if higher than what the holding task already has, of course).
Then return the task to normal when it unlocks the mutex.
This might be more trouble and cost more overhead than it's worth, but
in theory, it would be a supreme system.
