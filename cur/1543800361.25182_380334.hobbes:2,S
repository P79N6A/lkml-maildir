Yes, this fixes both my test-case (transcode & little program), they
get priority 25 instead of ~16.
But the priority of DD is now ~23 and so it still suffers a bit:
paolo@tux /mnt $ mount space/; time dd if=space/bigfile of=/dev/null bs=1M count=128; umount space/
128+0 records in
128+0 records out
real    0m8.549s	(instead of 4s)
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.209s
