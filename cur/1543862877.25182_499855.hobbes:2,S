Exactly what I was trying to suggest.
Looking closer at the code I think it makes sense to just kill the union and
stop the discrimination between physical and logical modes and just have a
dest field in the structure.  Roughly as you were suggesting at first.
The reason we aren't bitten by this on a regular basis is the normal code
path uses logical.logical_dest in both logical and physical modes.
Which is a little confusing.
Since there really isn't a distinction to be made we should just stop
trying, which will make maintenance easier :)
Currently there are several non-common case users of physical_dest
that are probably bitten by this problem under the right
circumstances.
So I think we should just make the structure:
struct IO_APIC_route_entry {
	__u32	vector		:  8,
		delivery_mode	:  3,	/* 000: FIXED
					 * 001: lowest prio
					 * 111: ExtINT
					 */
		dest_mode	:  1,	/* 0: physical, 1: logical */
		delivery_status	:  1,
		polarity	:  1,
		irr		:  1,
		trigger		:  1,	/* 0: edge, 1: level */
		mask		:  1,	/* 0: enabled, 1: disabled */
		__reserved_2	: 15;
	__u32	__reserved_3	: 24,
		__dest		:  8;
} __attribute__ ((packed));
And fixup the users.  This should keep us from getting bit by this bug
in the future.  Like when people start introducing support for more
than 256 cores and the low 24bits start getting used.
Or when someone new starts working on the code and thinks the fact
the field name says logical we are actually using the apic in logical
mode.
