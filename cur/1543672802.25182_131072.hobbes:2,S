I could be wrong, but won't that break the following sequence of
operations,
    mkdir("foo", 0755);
    fd = creat("foo/bar", 0644);
    unlink("foo/bar");
    rmdir("foo"); /* this should succeed, but if the file is hashed
		     we get EBUSY here */
    close(fd);
Or have potential deadlock effects when rmdir is replaced with some
operation that tries to perform a lookup for the inode, f.i. a
stat("foo/bar", &statbuf);
