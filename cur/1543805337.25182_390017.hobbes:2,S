True, the unlocking thread doesn't have to yield to the new mutex owner 
as a direct consequence of the unlock. But logically, if the unlocking 
thread subsequently calls mutex_lock, it must block, because some other 
thread has already been assigned ownership of the mutex.

A straightforward reading of the language here says the decision happens 
"when pthread_mutex_unlock() is called" and not at any later time. There 
is nothing here to support your interpretation.

Clearly the point is that one of the waiting threads is waken and gets 
the mutex, and it doesn't matter which thread is chosen. I.e., whatever 
thread the scheduling policy chooses. The fact that SCHED_OTHER can 
choose arbitrarily is immaterial, it still can only choose one of the 
waiting threads.
The fact that SCHED_OTHER's scheduling behavior is undefined is not free 
license to implement whatever you want. Scheduling policies are an 
optional feature; the basic thread behavior must still be consistent 
even on systems that don't implement scheduling policies.
