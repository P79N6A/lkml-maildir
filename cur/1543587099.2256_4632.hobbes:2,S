Hello!
Some time ago I had an undefined symbol in kernel compilation (__mul64) It
was sparc architecture, cross compilation on solaris/sparc. I have found
that 64-bit multiplication is in nfs2xdr.c, nfs_xdr_statfsres function. The
multiplication is by nfs_fsinfo->bsize.
For some reason nfs_fsinfo->bsize is declared as __u64. I don't see how
block size can be greater that 2G. What is the reason behind such type
for block size?
I did the following change and nfs still works fine. I've also rearranged
structure fields for alignment reasons.
