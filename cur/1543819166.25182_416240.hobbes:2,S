There was no problem if I just load and unload the module. But if I  
write to the device using "ls > /dev/temp" and then unload the  
module, I would get slab corruption.  I tried to install 2.6.16.5 at  
the moment but got stuck when I was making an initrd image file (no  
output file produced! and no errors displayed). Once I get around  
this problem, I should be able to test it on the new kernel.
