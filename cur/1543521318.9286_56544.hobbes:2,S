	That cache is populated upon foo_read_inode() (by
init_special_inode()) and the search key in this cache is (major+minor).
Notice that such searches should be done _only_ upon the interaction with
user / filesystem. Internally kernel should just use the pointer. Period.

	No, thanks. Character devices _are_ different; by coincidence we
are using 16bit integers to refer both to block and character devices, but
that's about it. Moreover, interface between block device and the kernel
is not a file one - fs/block_dev.c provides the glue that allows accessing
the block device as file, but that's none of device's business. It's main
interface is the request queue. Moreover, there is a notion of partitions
for block devices, and that notion doesn't belong to drivers. IOW, it's
VFS that makes character and block devices look similar. They have totally
different natures.

	Umm... I'ld rather had that done statically, in register_...()
time. No need to breed complexity...

	major_struct is completely bogus. We don't have 1-1 correspondence
between majors and drivers. We don't have 1-1 correspondence between
majors and physical units (disks). So I think that correct way looks so:
	a) generic support for sets of embedded ranges. I.e. the node is a
range + set of non-overlapping subranges(==subnodes) + function + pointer
to data. We
have 4 functions:
range_lookup: node x value -> node
range_add: node x from x to x function x data -> subnode
range_delete: node ->
range_fit: node x range_size x function x data -> subnode.
	range_add() tries to add a subnode to a node. If the requested
range overlaps with any of existing subranges - too bad, -EBUSY. Otherwise
we are getting a pointer to new node.
	range_fit() does almost the same, except that instead of defining
range by its ends we just say what size we want.
	range_delete() - well, obvious.
	range_lookup() goes for the smallest range containing value (i.e.
goes down the tree), then if the node doesn't have associated function -
return the node, otherwise call the function and if it had lead to
creation of smaller subrange containing our value - go there and repeat
the process.
	Typically function associated with the node will do required
request_module(). E.g. root of the character device tree will have 'ask
for char-major-<upper 8 bits of dev_t>' here. And its subnode with range
0xa00--0xaff will have 'ask for char-major-10-<lower 8 bits>'.
	'Data' is opaque wrt to this beast, but the callers of
range_lookup() will know what to expect there. E.g. block device may
require a range for itself + subranges for disks. Said subranges will have
pointer to struct gendisk as a 'data'. OTOH per-driver range may have
block_device_operations + other per-driver stuff kept that way.
	Notice that this structure _is_ common for block and character
devices - it's simply a generic parser for dev_t-like data (i.e. a Shannon
tree...).

	You are not going to get rid of them. Sorry. Page alignment can be
totally incompatible. Just Don't Do It (tm).

First of all, I _don't_ _want_ ioctl(). The less of those we have, the
happier I will be. It was the worst idea in v7. Hell, they did it right in
_mid-80s_ in Plan 9. 15 years later we keep adding this mess. Ironic,
since we also have Plan 9-ish solution for that - pseudofs (in our case -
/proc)... One of the greatest ideas in UNIX is that everything is a stream
of characters, so WTF messing with the special interfaces for passing
commands to drivers? write() and read() are there for purpose... I would
consider ioctl() as a backwards compatibility kludge, in some cases
mandated by POSIX. And POSIX has _nothing_ with taste or elegance - it's a
codification of the worst Missed'em'V misfeatures. We may need to support
it, but going further than that...<shudder>

	Uniform? Let's see: open() and release() are common (under various
names) for next to any object in the kernel. ioctl() is, excuse me, a
barf-bag for all irregular stuff. So yes, both classes have irregular
pieces of interface. And they happen to have names. Great.
	About all uniformity that is there is that we have an external
representation of those with numbers and we have modules bound to
subranges of dev_t space. That's it. We need to be able to say 'I want
42, take care of modules' and we need to be able to say 'I'm responsible
for range 13--69, here's the structure you should give to anyone who'll
ask for values in that range'. _That_ is common, the rest... No.
