Right - and my point is that putting one cast way down at the bottom
to quiet a warning doesn't do much good - the cast should be pushed
up to as close to that set_fs() as feasible.  Otherwise if some other,
new, caller surfaces and bogusly passes something *else* in that
void * pointer, it gets a lot harder for sparse and similar to do their
jobs.
