That wouldn't match any existing setup, and would be subject to mid-list 
insertions if a NIC were added/replaced. And that is fragile.
I was looking for an easy way to do PCI slot to MAC, and from there MAC 
to IP, so any NIC plugged into a given slot could be called eth0 (for 
instance) and given the "right" IP address, but that's not easy. Can be 
done with some searching in /sys, but it's non-trivial.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
