Same here, well.
I use 2.5.70-mm3 and my PS2 Keyboard once swichted TO BIG CHARS. I
unplugged/plugged and it went complete mad, sound began too loop. I
unplugged and replugged, after a while it worked again...
Sometime a key is very fast repeated 10 to 20 times after pressed only
one.
On the other side, everything seems to be smooth and running fine :)
