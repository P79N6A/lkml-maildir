Indeed. The monotonic clock's behavior around suspend and resume is
poorly defined. When we increased it, folks didn't like the fact that
uptime would increase while a system was suspended.

While I'd prefer wrapping it in a interface and keeping it in
timekeeping (rather then exporting a collection of values that should be
combined in varying ways), I think this approach is probably the best.
Rather then forcing one behavior or the other we can provide both smooth
monotonic and monotonic w/ sleep.

As I said, could we wrap this in a function? 
Maybe something like get_monotonicwithsleep_time() (feel free to come up
with a better name :).

Otherwise it looks good.
Thanks for bringing this up!
