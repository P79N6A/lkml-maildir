However, the attached patch would totally stuff certainly the ARM architecture
and quite possibly any other architecture whos physical memory did not start
at zero - the bitmap would become unnecessarily huge.
There are two ways of fixing this:
1. Define something which returns an offset into physical memory
2. Pass a parameter into init_bootmem which is the start of physical
   memory and use the virt_to_phys routines.
As an aside, shouldn't __va be renamed to __phys_to_virt if it is a
lower-level version of phys_to_virt to follow the apparant standard
naming conventions in the Linux kernel?
