Linus, after some test i'd suggest to reposition MM_AFFINITY_BONUS to 1
for a better interactive feeling.
The other issue is TICK_SCALE()/NICE_TO_TICKS() that does not permit fine
tuned time slices. I'd like to try shorter ts but the current shifting
implementation does not give enough control over final values. What about
having a table :
unsigned char ts_table[];
that is filled in sched_init() and is used like :
p->time_slice = ts_table[20 - p->nice];
The TICK_SCALE()/NICE_TO_TICKS() is no more critical because is now called
with a nr_running frequency and no more with a total processes frequency.
