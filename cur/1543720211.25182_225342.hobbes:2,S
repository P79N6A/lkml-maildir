Hmm I really wanted this rlimit to move to the struct user, but afaik that
work hasn't been merged yet. Once that is done it's easy to fix the SHM
stuff, just keep track of the struct user to which it's accounted. But you
are right, the count can go bonkers if another process unlocks is than that
locked it.
