There's really two different interfaces: those to the controller and those 
to the container.  While the configfs (or simpler fs implementation solely 
for our purposes) is the most logical because of its inherent hierarchial 
nature, it seems like the only criticism on that has come from UBC.  From 
my understanding of beancounter, it could be implemented on top of any 
such container abstraction anyway.
