That message is coming from your hotplug scripts.
At approximately test12-o'clock the following change was made:
diff -u --recursive --new-file t12p7/linux/drivers/pci/pci.c linux/drivers/pci/pci.c
--- t12p7/linux/drivers/pci/pci.c       Thu Dec  7 15:56:26 2000

        i = 0;
So I guess your PCI hotplug script hasn't caught up with this
change in the format of its arguments.
