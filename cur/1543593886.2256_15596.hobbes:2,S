Hmmm, interesting.  I'd noticed this when testing the ISA PnP changes
to the driver, but since the config the in-kernel PnP code was picking
worked on the two machines I tried, I thought it was a relatively
harmless glitch.  I had little success parsing the PnP driver myself
when I tried, and unfortunately I've little time for working in depth
on sound stuff at the moment.  I'm willing to test out any suggestions,
though.
