Subject: [Announce] APIC timers module

The APIC timer module provides an implementation of precise timers for
the 2.3.99pre9 kernels and further.
The precision is about 1-2 us. The usage is similar to a struct
timer_list, except for "expires", which is programmed with a value of 
the TSC register.
It is accomplished by using the timer of the local APIC, availaible on
P6 processors, but not used in uni-proc (the module cannot be used with
SMP!).
There is a small patch, but most of the stuff is in a module.

It was developped at the University of Karlsruhe, in the Institute
of Telematics. It will be used in a Differentiated Services
implementation
