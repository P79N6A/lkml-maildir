   I disagree the stability/feature ratio needs are different between
   kernel and userspace (at least excluding the FPU handling that of
   course doesn't matter for kernel :).
Tell that to people who want a %100 standards compliant c++ compiler.
:-)
Offering that adds a certain amount of risk.  It may be desirable to
not take that risk for building the kernel, and the kernel has no c++
needs thus...
Often, suitability of a compiler for the kernel is based upon time in
widespread use.
I have no arguments against your statements that 2.2.x, 2.4.x should
be fixed to build with the newer compiler.  It should be fixed as soon
as possible, without question.
Later,
