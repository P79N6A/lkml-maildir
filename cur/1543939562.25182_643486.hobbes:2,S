Having the notification be via poll() is a very restrictive processing
model.  Having the notification be via a signal means that any kind of
process (and not just those that are event loop driven) can register
a callback at some arbitrary point in the code and be notified.  I
don't object to the poll() interface, but it would be good to have a
signal mechanism also.
Cheers, Andreas
