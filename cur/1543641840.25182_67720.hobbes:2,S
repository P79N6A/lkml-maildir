My understanding is that US_FL_FIX_INQUIRY flag fakes a response
without sending the SCSI inquiry to the device at all.
What revision number does your device have, so we can limit the range
(mine is 0113)?  How about US_FL_MODE_XLATE and US_FL_START_STOP -
how to test if these flags are necessary?
Thanks,
Marek
