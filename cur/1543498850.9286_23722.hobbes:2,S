Running a RH6.0 linux dist, with ppp at 2.3.7 
kernel 2.2.5-15
everything runs fine .... original .config has many <M> modules
ppp runs fine ...
rebuilt the kernel, eliminating module support for everthing
kernel sources are 2.3.6/2.3.5 
everytime I fire up ppp 2.3.7, 2.3.8 doesn't matter,
the bottom message comes up.
Checked /lib/modules/2.3.6/net .... no ppp.o
I am at a total LOSS ....
