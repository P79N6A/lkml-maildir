This does cause the process to sleep - in an interruptible wait.
Please give more details about the problem you're seeing.  Have you
tried getting a process listing from a different virtual console,
xterm or whatever you normally use?  What does that say?

Sorry, but I cannot get anything else to run.  I can barely get XWindows to
kill the process.
What prevents schedule() from returning to the current process w/o any

Thanks, karl m
