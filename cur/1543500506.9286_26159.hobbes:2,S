No, I don't think so ..
Say you have /usr/fnord on your root filesystem. Then, /usr gets mounted
and /usr/fnord dissapears. When you export / over NFS, /usr is not exported.
Do you now get to see /usr/fnord on the NFS client, or not? _That_ is
what the option CONFIG_NFSD_SUN does, at least if I'm understanding
things correctly.

Yup..
