But the kernel itself has to know how to probe and initialize these devices
at boot time, correct?  That information is implicitly exported via
/var/log/dmesg -- I'm simply suggesting that it be a little more explicit.

Some of the on-board devices on my Tyan Thunder are ISA.

Would that be feasible without root privileges in order to read kmem?
