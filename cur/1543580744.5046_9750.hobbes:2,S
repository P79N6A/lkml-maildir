Yepp.

True.

Yes - but that is no soloution for a generic model.  AFAICS even XFS
falls back to buffer_head's for small requests.

Yes.

What do you thing is the alternative?

But it will have the same problems as the array soloution: there will
be one complete kio structure for each kiobuf, with it's own end_io
callback, etc.

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
