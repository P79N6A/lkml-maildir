This testing was done on a system with your patch applied, right?
Because on a stock kernel, the various shells are of course
confused by the "-v -x" argv[1].
I will grant that ksh, bash, ash, tcsh and zsh are likely ok
(willing to see > 1 option before the script file name.)
An alternative way to test the same thing, that works even on
a stock kernel:
  $ echo 'echo "$*"' > ./d
  $ ash -e -e ./d 1 2 3
  $ tcsh -v -v ./d 1 2 3
  $ zsh -e -e ./d 1 2 3
  $ ksh -e -e ./d 1 2 3
  $ bash -e -e ./d 1 2 3
The thing being tested: will a shell handle > 1 option before a script
file name.  Each shell invocation of the "./d" script should echo the
script file arguments "1 2 3".
