And what I'm wondering is, whatever order the steps occur, are they
grouped together so that time is minimized between the first and last
step for a given file? Wouldn't that produce the most consistency in the
face of failure (lacking a journal)?
If anybody wants to flame me for saying something obvious or stupid,
please go ahead, but add some constructive explanations too. I'm trying to
grok the fs stuff, but I'm just beginning.
