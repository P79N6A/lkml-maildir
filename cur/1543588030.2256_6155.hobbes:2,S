I don't see why not. I created my own mkdir and rmdir handlers in my
module.  I'd like to use the lookup function that proc supplies instead
of supplying my own, why shouldn't I be allowed to do that?  It's not as
if I am doing something other than what normally happens:  I am
assigning inode_operations::lookup to be proc_lookup.
