Yes.   I originally had the constants #defined in the header and a whole
heap of BUILD_BUG_ON(XYZ_offset != offsetof(xyz)) in my module, which
was even uglier (but at least contained in my code).

Good idea, except I currently use sizeof(hypervisor_blob): I'd have to
extract the size separately and hand it in the CFLAGS 8(

We only have one switcher: it contains an array of "struct
lguest_state"; one for each guest.  (This is host code we're looking at
here).

HYPE_DATA_SIZE is the size of the hypervisor.S data segment, I'm not
sure how I'd get that into asm_offsets....

HYPERVISOR_SIZE here is 64k, so it's actually OK (we use the space after
the ~3k text & data from hypervisor.S to hold as many struct
lguest_state's as we can).  The name is bad tho; SWITCHER_MAP_SIZE would
probably be better...

I could, but there doesn't seem a great deal of point.  If anyone else
is using them, we're in trouble already...

No, the guest should not be able to evoke a printk from the host kernel.
In this case, however, we'll reflect the trap to the kernel, or if the
kernel hasn't installed an IDT yet we'll kill the guest and the lguest
program will get the string "unhandled trap 13 at <EIP> (err=0)".
Basically this emulation code is simply to get us through all that
annoying early boot probing (paravirt_ops does *not* override in/out).

What do we care if the guest process has unmapped the lguest_data page:
it's his funeral.  We could put a kill_guest there, but it seems a waste
of code to me.

This was in prep to unexport paravirt_ops, but you threatened the freeze
on me so I pushed this ahead.
Some of this code will get cleaned up along with others when that patch
goes through (my idea is that we'll make sure to expose the native
versions as inlines, so this code can use native_read_cr0 etc. directly.
lguest hosts cannot be paravirtualized anyway 8).

Yes, that code always mystified me...

It's waiting for the dynamic tick code to go in.  Again, I was hoping
that that would go in and I could go in behind it, but you made it clear
that waiting longer isn't an option.

If this happens then the process inside the guest which is doing this
will get a Segmentation Fault, because we'll deliver a GPF to the kernel
at that EIP.  In practice, glibc doesn't do this that I have found.  The
note is there so I think harder about it if anyone reports strange segvs
under lguest 8)

Why?  And I still don't get what loops?

Good catch.  Should lock out cpu hotplug during this.  Once it's done,
we're fine, because we clear the feature bit.  Same when putting it
back.

Hmm, I hope the kasprintf won't barf... this buffer gets handed straight
to the lguest process on its next read.

Or I'll kill the macro altogether.  It's useful for shotgun debugging a
guest, but it's unused.

Yeah, we don't define it anywhere, and we probably should.  From
irqflags.h:
static inline int raw_irqs_disabled_flags(unsigned long flags)
{
	return !(flags & (1 << 9));
}

It would have to be a switch then gunk at the bottom, because those last
two tests don't switch-ify.  IIRC I changed back from a switch because
of that.

No, get_futex_key handles anything; we rely on that in futex.c

Good call... we expose native_cpuid so I should use that (I can't use
cpuid: this *is* cpuid!)

Yes, ugly code.  Usually this stuff is done in asm, so it doesn't exist
in a header.  I'll fix it.

Sure, but then I'll hit all the things I don't want to override, and
it'll be far less clear.

I know, I had to change this back to backport from -mm tree 8(
Fortunately, the breakage is *really* obvious when it happens.

OK, I'll resend patches (in 4 parts) based on these comments (and
Andrew's).
