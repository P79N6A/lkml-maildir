Thank you very much for testing the patches. Based on the feedback I
received I am goping to drop that DMI patch - does not save enough to
justify the ifdefs...

Yes - we in fact getting somewhat a "new" device with new capabilities so
the driver unregisters old input device and creates a new one. I strongly
believe that we should not change input device attributes "on fly".

"Classic" PS/2 protocol specifies available resolutions of 1, 2, 4 and 8
units per mm which gives you 25, 50, 100 and 200 cpi respectively. I am
surprised that Lifebook simply doubles the rates, but if it does I guess
the patch below will suffice.

===================================================================
Input: apparently Lifebook touchscreens have double resolution
       compared to "classic" PS/2 mice, provide appropriate
       resolution setting handler.
