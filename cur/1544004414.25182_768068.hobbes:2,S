Yes, but I failed to find our previous discussions via google, and actually
I prefer to see them all on marc.info, so I can quickly find them...

I doubt very much we can do this. This can break the existing applications
which can overload ->si_pid. I think it is better to pass ->si_pid as is.
If user-space sends siginfo_t so sub-namespace, it must know what it does.
I don't think the kernel can help, it just can't know what ->si_pid actually
means. Unless this is documented somewhere, but I don't know.

I don't think we can rely on in_interrupt() check. Thnk about some device
drivers which can send the notification from workqueue, or from kernel
thread... Say, can you see when drivers/usb/core/devio.c does
async_completed() ? And note that SI_ASYNCIO is SI_FROMUSER.
Even _if_ it is safe to use in_interrupt() right now, I don't think we
can rely on this fact.

Ah yes, we have it ;)
