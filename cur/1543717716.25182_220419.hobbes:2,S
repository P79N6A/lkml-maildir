Oh.  That's why the volatiles are there.
+static int
+hpet_release (struct inode *inode, struct file *file)
+{
+	struct hpet_dev	*devp;
+	volatile struct hpet_timer *timer;
+
+	devp = file->private_data;
+	timer = devp->hd_timer;
+
+	spin_lock_irq(&hpet_lock);

+	timer->hpet_config &= ~Tn_INT_ENB_CNF_MASK;
local variable `timer' points at hardware.
Methinks this all should be converted to readl and friends, no?
