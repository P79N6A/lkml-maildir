So what you are saying is that IPv4 should not be included because
there are userspace tools that need to be downloaded to be able to use
those features such as ifconfig(8), route(8), arp(8), ip(8),
ipfwadm(8), ipportfw(8), ipautofw(8), ipchains(8), etc...  Taking it
to the sublime -- lets not include the kernel because you would need
to download bash(1)!  There may be other issues, but I don't think
this one is particularly compelling.
