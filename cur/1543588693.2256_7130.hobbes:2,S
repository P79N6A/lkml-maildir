I haven't got one for my Linux port, but the company is Motionbase,
http://www.motionbase.com/,
 which at least has some piccy's of the
hardware in action. (Unless you meant Ingo's project, oops!)
The nature of driver is such that it's "useless" unless you have one of
these platforms, so it's not really for the average chap... :)
As the card offers analog inputs which are commonly used for
joysticks/steering wheels depending on the application being run, I plan
to create a joystick abstraction device that pipes the analog inputs
through the joystick interface too, so that any software can use joysticks
in a standard way regardless of whether they're using the platform or just
a regular PC. I'm developing for 2.2.x, but once that's working I'll adapt
the code for 2.4.x and use the event interface, devfs etc. where
necessary.

Yup, that's the one, hopefully everyone except me noticed that one! :)
Thanks for the help so far, appreciated.
