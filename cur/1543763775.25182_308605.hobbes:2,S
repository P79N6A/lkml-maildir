Hey,
I apologize in advance if this is not the right place
to ask. Feel free to redirect me there :)
I just wanted to know if the 2.4 kernel is aware of
hyperthreading the same way the 2.6 kernel ist or if
the issues posted earlier
(

 )
(

)
still apply.
I would appreciate it if you could send me additional information or
resources
as well.
Thanks in advance,
Lars
