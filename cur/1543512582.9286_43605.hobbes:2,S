I have asked the following question on several other
newsgroups, and I was told it deals with the Linux
kernel.  I was referred to this mailing list for
further help.  If this post is inappropriate for this
mailing list I apologize.
I am a newbie to Linux and thought you guys might be
able to help me out.  I am in an operating systems
class and I have to write a research paper on
Linux. I was wondering if you could recommend a book
or other published material (ie. journal) that would
contain information about the following
topics in the Linux kernel: 
- Device and Resource Management
- Memory Management 
- Process Management 
- File Management 
- CPU Scheduling 
- I/O Systems 
- Anything else relating to those topics 
I already have the book "Linux Kernel Interals".  So I
am looking for a different source than that.
Thanks for any help you might be able to provide.
