Yes, but zoneinfo ALSO provides support for leap seconds.  Do read man
zic for specific details.

I think you particularly mean NTP.  I think your reasoning is that
because NTP's timestamp doesn't include leap seconds, and because we all
like to use NTP to synchronise our clocks, Linux has to make up the
difference.  But there is an alternative; which is for the NTP client to
insert those missing leap seconds, which number it can get from
zoneinfo.  Epoch remains the start of  1978; seconds between any two
dates included leap-seconds and no special kernel support is required.
