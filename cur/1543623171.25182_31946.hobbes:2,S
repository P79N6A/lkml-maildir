Hi,
found time to read e-mails and write code.
- 730 fix (this ATA100 chipset uses the ATA66 family register layout)
- Hang if UDMA is not set by BIOS fix (thanks to Manfred Spraul)
If you have a 730 chipset or if you couldn't boot without ide=nodma please
test latest patch and report the results to me.
