Cool.
Thanks to Arjan's insistence, I also took a look at adding statics
and unexpectedly discovered yet another 50 kbytes of dead code
(I'm not kidding).
Attached are three patches which fix that:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
 261433   50018    1172  312623   4c52f linux-2.6.23-rc1.org.t/drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/built-in.o
 199654   50018    1172  250844   3d3dc linux-2.6.23-rc1.aic.t/drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/built-in.o
 184014   21314    1172  206500   326a4 linux-2.6.23-rc1.aic1.t/drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/built-in.o
 202378    2850    1172  206400   32640 linux-2.6.23-rc1.aic2.t/drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/built-in.o
1-debloat.patch    deinlines a lot of functions
2-addstatic.patch  adds statics, #ifdefs out huge amount of unused code, adds consts
3-addconst.patch   adds more consts
make namespacecheck goes from 400+ functions to:
  drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic79xx_core.o
    ahd_inq
    ahd_inw
    ahd_outq
    ahd_outw
  drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic79xx_osm.o
    ahd_insb
  drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_core.o
    ahc_inq
    ahc_outq
  drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_osm.o
    ahc_insb
None of these patches actually touch any logic, code changes
are pretty minimal.
Compile tested and applies cleanly to 2.6.23-rc1, applies with some fuzz to 2.6.23-rc3.
Please propagate to mainline.
