Hi Maciej,
I am also experiencing some strange hangups, without having had the
time to investigate them. Nothing in syslog, but a sure way NOT to
have problems: I have run all 2.4.23-pre kernels, and this has
definitely started with -pre7. Everything until -pre6 was fine.
My feeling tells me it has to do with DRM, so I built the -rc1-pac1
kernel about three hours ago, without any hickups so far.
Best regards from Hamburg, Germany.
Peter
