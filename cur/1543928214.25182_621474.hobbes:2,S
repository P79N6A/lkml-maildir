I suspect that given the "once it escapes, it's cast in stone" view we take
towards user-visible API/etc, there isn't much *real* room for an
'EXPERIMENTAL' flag anymore.  Most of the usage should probably be confined to
individual drivers, where all we should need is a 'default n' and suitable
warning verbiage in the Kconfig file warning about the driver eating your
filesystems and small animals for breakfast.  We certainly shouldn't have
one big flag for *all* in-progress drivers - I don't need to accidentally
enable a busticated ethernet driver because I want a USB widget.  And if
you're worried about people accidentally enabling it, then *each driver*
should have a 'Do you really mean it?' flag with *opposite* sense (so
that 'make allyesconfig' doesn't turn it on by accident).
Anything bigger than that, we probably want to redefine 'experimental'
as "it doesn't escape from -mm to mainline till it's ready".
