How about finding someone with a fat pipe (probably not redhat - maybe
VA) who donates a day of bandwith. 
Then write a client which contacts this host via ftp (or maybe http
too) at this day.
distribute this to a lot of linux users (shouldn't be to difficult,
just anounce it on slashdot, they don't have anything better to do -
hey I read it too). this should be a pretty good set of different
connections & client speeds. you might even want to write a windows &
mac client.
the client could even be running all the time and get information
about benchmark times and needs from the benchmark server, similar to
the distributed.net client.
so - who gets VA, slashdot & maybe distributed.net together and who
writes the server/client ?
just an idea,
christof
