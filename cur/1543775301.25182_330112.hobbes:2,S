thanks it seems working on my desktop, i'll try on my notebook too.
the problem is that plugging a imps2 mouse to notebook doesn't work with
synaptics touchpad.
i needed to unload psmouse module and reload with proto=imps
in win drivers (sorry!) i see that as soon as i plug the mouse, driver
intercept it and says
that synaptics advanced features will be disabled.
when i unplug the mouse i get this features back.
i'd like linux to do the same thing automatically, i'll play with
protocol auto and resetafter values 
I'll report my test results
