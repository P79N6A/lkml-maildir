I'd actually prefer the one-stage link.  That takes better advantage of
the infrastructure that you've put in place.
Instead of making LDFLAGS_vmlinux available to the arch Makefile, can
you make cmd_link_vmlinux available?  Then I can just rewrite it.
That looks like it has no impact on the global Makefile except for moving
it above the include of the arch Makefile.
