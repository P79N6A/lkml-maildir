Hi,
Can any kind soul with a working .config (no modules, boot from AIC7xxx JBOD 
disk is fine) for a Dell 2650 for 2.5.6anything kindly send me a copy? 
Off-list is probably best -  I'm trying to get this patch going, but am 
having an unbeliveable amount of difficulty getting this system booted.
Thanks, Shaheed
