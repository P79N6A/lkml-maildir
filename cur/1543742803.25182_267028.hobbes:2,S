In your case, it's a bug which needs to be fixed. It hasn't got anything to
do with usb-storage or SCSI. But I'm still trying to find an approach which
works well. The basic problem is a combination of:
1. failure to start the device before calling add_disk
2. calling check_disk_change for all opens
3. returning a failure from media_present
If any of these conditions is removed, you will not see the problem.
I tried #1 for so-called "Key Distributed on Kernel Summit", but this
is not general enough, in particular your device appears resilient to that.
#2 would require distinguishing opens coming from user level from opens
called by the partition reading code, called indirectly from do_open.
I do not see how I can do that smoothly.
#3 causes the boolean logics on flags to become too involved.
