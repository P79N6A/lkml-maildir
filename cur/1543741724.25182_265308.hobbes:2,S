hi all,
i hope this is the right place to ask question... anyway, it goes like this:
how can i invalidate the read cache for a file system?
the reason i'm asking this question is:
i'm mounting this ntfs partition to my linux box r/o, which i also
used by "another os" running under vmware r/w.
so when this partition gets updated under vmware, linux does not get
the changes until i umount / mount the partition again.
the problem is, i cant do this when the partiton is busy so i'm stuck
with invalid directory entries etc...
so, is there a way to disable or invalidate the read cache for this partition?
thanks in advance.
