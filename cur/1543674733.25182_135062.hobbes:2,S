For nmi_watchdog=1 the NMI watchdog uses the programmable interval timer
to trigger interrupt events via the IOAPIC. with nmi_watchdog=2 we use the 
performance counters on the processor to trigger these events. IOAPICs 
are generally found on SMP motherboards (but there are UP boards with 
them, it's chipset dependent). Generally i686+ (save some Athlons and a 
few other processors) will work with nmi_watchdog=2.
