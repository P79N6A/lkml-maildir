Yes, if you really need it to be so... Or you can use LD_PRELOAD approach...

I had.

Looks like you just can not remember few words said only two dais ago.
-- cut --
        a) breaking mmap() semantics.
        b) breaking lseek() semantics.
        c) breaking write() semantics.
        d) being bloody slow, painful and kludgy.
        e) making FAT support with the new page cache hard.
        f) confusing the hell of unaware victims^Wusers.
        g) bringing the list of magical filename extensions into the kernel.
        h) belonging to userland *and* being already implemented there.

Looks like for you only g) is a problem and all other problems are just a
breeze. If so then can you cook up a patch ?

How DOS filesystem sematic require CRLF usage ? I use unix-style text-files in
Windows usually (internal editore of FAR handle them just fine) if at all...
If you'll convert CRLF's in WinWord file it'll just made it completely
unreadable...
