I've also had problems with 2.5.17 (haven't tested 2.5.18) and a USB
  ZIP drive (Zip 250 USB-powered).  It looks like a write operation times
  out, and the drive keeps getting reassigned new USB device numbers.  I
  can provide more info if anyone's interested.  I *do* recall that it's
  something like bulk_write, and it fails with error -110.
