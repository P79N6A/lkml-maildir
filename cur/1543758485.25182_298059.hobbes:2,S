Subject: status of the USB w9968cf.c driver in kernel 2.6?

I noticed the following regarding the drivers/usb/media/ov511.c driver:
- it's not updated compared to upstream:
- there's no w9968cf-vpp module in the kernel sources
Are there any reasons why the upstream driver can't be resynced with the
kernel?
