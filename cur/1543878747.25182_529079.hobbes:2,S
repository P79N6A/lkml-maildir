As far as my understanding goes, the four underscore version is for 
aligning members/elements within a data structure, and the two underscore 
version is for aligning statically defined variables.
The dual underscore version places the variable in a separate section meant
for cacheline aligned variables, so that there is no false sharing on the
cacheline with a consecutive datum.  For regular statically defined data
structures, the latter has to be used, but since your patch uses per-cpu data, 
which is already in a separate section, you had to use the former I guess.

Yes.  But the wastage depends on the data structure now being aligned rather
than the structure that happened to be there before.  You cannot not lose
memory while padding I guess :).  But padding for per-cpu data seems a bit 
odd and I am not sure if it is worth it for 0.5% gain.
Thanks,
