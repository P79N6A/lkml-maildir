Hi there,
I want to get cloop-1.02 work on a Linux-2.4.21 box. I downloaded the source, 
compiled it and everthing seems OK. But when I tried "insmod ./cloop.o", 
there would be unresolved symbols. Could anyone provide expertise on this? I 
did have got cloop work on another Linux 2.6 box, rewriting the Makefile 
myself with kbuild. I thought the original Makefile provided by author should 
just work for 2.4, but I am out of luck:(
./cloop.o: unresolved symbol fput_R041e9ef0
./cloop.o: unresolved symbol irq_stat_R62a76ef0
./cloop.o: unresolved symbol create_bounce_R94ac00b1
./cloop.o: unresolved symbol blk_dev_R78f5967e
./cloop.o: unresolved symbol filp_close_R253c57bb
./cloop.o: unresolved symbol mem_map_Ra2dbbaa3
./cloop.o: unresolved symbol kmap_high_Rc804a874
./cloop.o: unresolved symbol blk_queue_make_request_R12d995a1
./cloop.o: unresolved symbol fget_R46e88355
./cloop.o: unresolved symbol highmem_start_page_R259972b3
./cloop.o: unresolved symbol register_disk_R6cbd4195
./cloop.o: unresolved symbol register_blkdev_Re7b627eb
./cloop.o: unresolved symbol __do_generic_file_read_R95bf9295
./cloop.o: unresolved symbol filp_open_Rec737d70
BTW, the maintainers of this project seems to be very very irresponsible. I am 
wondering if anyone still works on that.
TIA!
Lei
