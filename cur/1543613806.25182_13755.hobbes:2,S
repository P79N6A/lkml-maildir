Dear friends,
I'd like to apologize for the apparently sad state of kernel.org recently.
 We have been experiencing repeated hardware problems with the old server,
and it's pretty clear that it's no longer reliable.
The good news is that we're already in the process of provisioning a new
server, generously donated by Compaq.  Until that gets installed, though,
I'm afraid kernel.org is probably going to be rather flaky.  Please bear
with us...
