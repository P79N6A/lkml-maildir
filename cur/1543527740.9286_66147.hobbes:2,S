theone should join to discussions on linux-fbdev@vuser.vu.union.edu,
there are some thoughs about 32 VT per physical output device...
Anyway, that is not why I'm writting. I digged around and 
revealed enhandced vga16fb driver, which knows how to do
VGA 4bpp, cfb8 and text mode, you can download patch from
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/vga-2.3.48-pre2.gz.
  It uses only standard VGA registers, so you are limited with
640x480x4 (vga4), 320x200x8 (cfb8), 360x480x8 (vga8) and
90x60 (text with VGA8x8 font).
  It does not support font 9xX, hardware cursor and non-VGA
pixclock.
  You must enable VGA attribute&character support, VGA16 color planes
and 8bpp cfb to get full power. As patch name signals, patch can be used
with 2.3.48-pre2. I have to download real 2.3.48 yet, but I believe
that it will apply too, it was trivial to port it from 2.3.15...
