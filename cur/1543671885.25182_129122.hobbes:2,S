Older versions of word used to embed random bits of memory into the doc
file that word couldn't see.  I'm not sure of the versions that did it but
I once found an essay on the mark of the beast embedded in the
unreadable portions of woman's resume that didn't show until I used
catdoc.  She was most upset when I showed her.  That sort of error could
be catastrophic during contract negotiations if it happened to embed some
data that you didn't want to see such as opposing bids or something.
