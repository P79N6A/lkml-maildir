Subject: [PATCH] ramfs needs to update directory m/ctime on symlink

Hi.
Attached is a patch which addresses a problem in ramfs where it neglects
to update the directory mtime and ctime fields when creating a new symbolic
link.  Ramfs was modified in 2.6.15 to update these fields when other types
of entries are created.  The symlink support is separate from that other
support, so that change did not cover quite all of the possibilities.
All of the directory content manipulation entry points now seem to be
covered with respect to these time field updates.
    Thanx...
       ps
