I had a user report a bug against the Fedora kernel where
his Matrox G400 wouldn't work with the matrox framebuffer
driver any more.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=195825
It turned out to be caused by the fact that the matrox_w1
one-wire driver had loaded first.  Moving that driver
out of the way so that it didn't get loaded would allow
the framebuffer driver to load.
There are a number of similar cases like this which seem
to be coming out of the woodwork lately.  I've also heard
as-yet unconfirmed rumours that agp-intel and one of the
watchdog drivers suffers the same "first to load wins" problem.
What's the correct way to fix this ?
