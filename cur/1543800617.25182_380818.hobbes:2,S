Er... yeah. I must have been off my nut when I wrote that comment.
A more apt comment should perhaps have been "dev_kfree_skb shouldn't be
used with interrupts disabled". Forgive my noobness, I'm a kernel patch virgin.
My logs were starting to fill with messages exatcly like that mentioned here:
http://patchwork.netfilter.org/netfilter-devel/patch.pl?id=2840
In any event, the patch at the end of that link was never applied (it doesn't
fix the other call to dev_kfree_skb). After applying my patch, I've not had any
more messages in the logs.
