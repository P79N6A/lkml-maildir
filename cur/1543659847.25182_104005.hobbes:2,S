The old version was 22.1. Now I have upgraded to 22.3.2, and it works:
karpfen:/home/dreher # lilo
Warning: Kernel & BIOS return differing head/sector geometries for device 
0x80
    Kernel: 14120 cylinders, 16 heads, 63 sectors
      BIOS: 1024 cylinders, 255 heads, 63 sectors
Added testing *

Added failsafe
Added linux-2.5.56
Added linux-2.5.50

Very good. Thank you very much for your quick help.
