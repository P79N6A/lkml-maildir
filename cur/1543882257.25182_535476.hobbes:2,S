Without someone holding Linus feet to the fire the next release may be a 
real POS. I think you have done the perfect job, identifying the show 
stoppers, quantifying the obscure and minor regressions, and serving to 
give testing targets as purported fixes are applied.
I don't think you should judge your work by leaving some targets for 
-stable and 2.6.22, but rather from the number of problems you detected, 
documented, and caused to be addressed.
If it were my week to be God, I would insist that the rcN to final step 
was regressions-only, and that all regressions be classified as (a) 
acceptable results of changes to fix other problems, (b) must be fixed 
before release, or (c) obscure enough to tolerate for a short time, must 
be fixed in stable and mainline before N+1 release.
Measuring releases or your own value against perfection is thankless!
