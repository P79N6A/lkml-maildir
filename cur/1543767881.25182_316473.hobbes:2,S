I posted a script which produces output along the lines of rev-tree's,
but which lists only commits relevant to a given file. However it lacked
correct information about the _branchpoint_ when branches were taken.
You could track the merges but not the full graph.
To do it properly would involve a modified version of rev-tree which
marks the 'interesting' commits and then prunes the uninteresting parts
before dumping what's left. I haven't got as far as _implementing_ that
yet.
