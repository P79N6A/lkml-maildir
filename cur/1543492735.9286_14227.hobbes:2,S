Ok.  This time I used 2.2.5-ac6 with the 0.5.2 patches and the new
mount from Apr 12th.  In the following log, morse is a Sun Ultra 60
(no users, only export is to me) with 100Mb Switched Ethernet.  Todi
is a 450Mhz Pentium II with 100Mb Switched Ethernet with above kernel.
[root@todi /tmp]# mount -o rw,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,nfsvers=3 morse:/xtmp /mnt

As you can see, Write performance is perfect.  Read performance is
still suffering.  For comparison, here are the results with NFSv2
on the same machine.  (Writes a bit faster than I recall, maybe the
32k wsize which I had heard was a tad unsafe with V2 NFS)
[root@todi /tmp]# mount -o rw,rsize=32768,wsize=32768 morse:/xtmp /mnt
[root@todi /tmp]# dd if=/dev/zero of=testfile count=8192
8192+0 records in
8192+0 records out
[root@todi /tmp]# ls -l testfile
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root      4194304 Apr 13 09:50 testfile
[root@todi /tmp]# time cp testfile /mnt
0.000u 0.100s 0:02.63 3.8%      0+0k 0+0io 1103pf+0w
[root@todi /tmp]# ls -l /mnt/test1
ls: /mnt/test1: No such file or directory
[root@todi /tmp]# ls -l /mnt/test1
-rw-------   1 root     bin       4194304 Apr 13 09:50 /mnt/test1
[root@todi /tmp]# time cp /mnt/test1 .

So, V2 NFS reads REAL fast, just writes slow.  V3 Writes REAL fast, 
just reads slow.  Let me know if there is anything I can try to
isolate this further.
