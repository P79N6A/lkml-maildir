They're extra.  As in "can be optimised away".

The buffer_head is not an IO container.  It is the kernel's core
representation of a disk block.  Usually (but not always) it is backed by
some memory which is in pagecache.  We can feed buffer_heads into IO
containers via submit_bh(), but that's far from the only thing we use
buffer_heads for.  We should have done s/buffer_head/block/g years ago.
JBD implements physical block-based journalling, so it is 100% appropriate
that JBD deal with these disk blocks using their buffer_head
representation.
That being said, ordered-data mode isn't really part of the JBD journalling
system at all (the data doesn't get journalled!) - ordered-mode is an
add-on to the JBD journal to make the metadata which we're about to journal
point at more-likely-to-be-correct data.
JBD's ordered-mode writeback is just a sync and I see no conceptual
problems with killing its old buffer_head based sync and moving it into the
21st century.

The ordered-data mode flush: sure.  The rest of JBD's use of buffer_heads
is quite appropriate.

I thought I fixed the performance problem?
Somewhat nastily, but as ext3 directories are metadata it is appropriate
that modifications to them be done in terms of buffer_heads (ie: blocks).

nfs_set_page_dirty() and reiserfs_set_page_dirty() should now bail if
PageDirty() to avoid needless work.

In this context ext3's "ordered" mode means "sync the file contents before
journalling the metadata which points at it".

No.  Setting a page (or bh, or inode) dirty means "this is known to have
been modified".  ie: this cached entity is now out of sync with backing
store.
Ho hum.  I don't care much, really.  But then, I understand how all this
stuff works.  Try explaining to someone the relationship between
pte-dirtiness, page-dirtiness, radix-tree-dirtiness and
buffer_head-dirtiness.
