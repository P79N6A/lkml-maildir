Your right Steven doesn't need to convince me. He requested comments and
I gave them, if he or you want to ignore them that's your prerogative.
How can you say I didn't read the answers .. I said "I read this 5
times" ! It doesn't get much more explicit than that .. In fact, my
response was mainly cause I thought his explanation was confusing.. How
can you fault _me_ for that, it's the medium we're using.
It seems like you assume all my emails are "demanding" and "aggressive",
where I'm just asking questions and making comments .. Who am I to be
making demands of anyone ?

I DEMAND you do what I say! You better do it or else! I'll force Linus
to ignore you, so you better do it.
