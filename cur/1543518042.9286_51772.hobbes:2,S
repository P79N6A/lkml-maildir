Hello!

Yes, IPv6 never was unloadable.
> The latest 2.3 kernels behave exactly the same...
Yes. It should have module use counts balanced now.
It is progress, but: counting total balance, 2.3 is still regress
in this area. The problem became more complicated, because
even virtual possibility to _unload_ some part of code
is followed by crowds of locks eating resources uselessly.
Existing destructors were written taking into account this,
but they were never debugged. It is thing to debug.
Also, evident flaw is that it has some evident things not counted and
good load of required destructors are missing. It is not thing
to debug, but thing to work on.
We need anyone, who is ready to work on the problem carefully,
patiently, be ready to accept fisco painlessly and be optimistic 8)8)8)
