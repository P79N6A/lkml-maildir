Actually, we'd have to keep at least the GRANT definition as well, since
that is used from avc_has_perm_noaudit() for the permissive mode case,
and I suppose we might as well leave the others alone and not disturb
the avc_update_node() code.  So the only changes I'd suggest are
removing the security_member_sid diffs (as it is now used) and including
your follow-up diff for making avtab_insert static.
