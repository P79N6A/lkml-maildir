It came with the 80 cable and I'm using it now with the exact
same results.  My BIOS says UDMA/82 for the one drive and UDMA/66
for the other.
Same speed result though.

[Favorite quotes of Linus Torvalds - Sept 6, 2000]
I'm a bastard. I have absolutely no clue why people can ever think
otherwise. Yet they do. People think I'm a nice guy, and the fact is that
I'm a scheming, conniving bastard who doesn't care for any hurt feelings
or lost hours of work if it just results in what I consider to be a better
system.  And I'm not just saying that. I'm really not a very nice person. 
I can say "I don't care" with a straight face, and really mean it.
