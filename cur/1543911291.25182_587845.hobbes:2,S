Yes that is what we expected. We need more information to figure out why 
the kmalloc_node fails there. It should walk through all nodes to find 
memory.
I see that you have 4 cpus and 16 nodes. How are the cpus assigned to 
nodes? If a cpu would be assigned to a nonexisting node then this could be 
the result.
Could you post the full boot log?
