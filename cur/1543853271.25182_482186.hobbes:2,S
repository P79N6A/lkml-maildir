Hi all
I noticed a slowdown (3%) on a io micro-benchmark on my machine with 
2.6.19-rc5-mm2
It appears time-uninline-jiffiesh.patch is sub-optimal at least for current 
compilers (tested gcc-4.0.4 here)
May I suggest :
1) make sure jiffies_to_usecs() is defined before being used in 
timespec_trunc() : Compiler will just optimize away not *needed* code.
OR :
2) Revert to inline versions of four functions jiffies_to_msecs(), 
jiffies_to_usecs(), msecs_to_jiffies() and usecs_to_jiffies() .
IMHO there is litle gain to call a function just to perform so basic 
arithmetics, that sometime compiler can perform at compilation time.
OR 
3) replace
	(jiffies_to_usecs(1) * 1000)
by
	(NSEC_PER_SEC / HZ)
With current patch, timespec_trunc() is not anymore a tail function.
struct timespec timespec_trunc(struct timespec t, unsigned gran)
{
        if (gran <= jiffies_to_usecs(1) * 1000) {
Much better here to have :
	if (gran < SOME_CONSTANT) 
Thank you
Eric
