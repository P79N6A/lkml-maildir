Hello,
I know this is off-topic, but I need help desperately (or else I'll lose
almost 2 weeks of work in kernel drivers).
One of my HD partitions has crashed, and I'd like to know if there is a
way I could try to recover the data on it. The first partition (/dev/hda1)
is working fine, but the second one (/dev/hda2) is not even mounting -ro.
When I try to run e2fsck manually (in single mode), it tells me:
# e2fsck /dev/hda2
e2fsck 1.10 24-Apr-97 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
e2fsck: Filesystem revision too high while trying to open /dev/hda2
Get a newer version of e2fsck!
#
I think this is probably due to the partition corruption, not because my
filesystem rev. is too new ...
If anyone could help me with this, I would _REALLY_ appreciate it.
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Ivan
