I played around with various settings on my notebook and noticed that
setting the link to 10BaseT-HD gave me a troughput of ~900KB/s.
No error messages in syslog, but ifconfig is still showing lots of errors
and collisions.

          inet addr:192.168.0.147  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0

I got this after copying 20 MB from the gateway to the notebook.
