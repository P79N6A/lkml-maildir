I have a plan to use it for something that no-one knows about yet..
I was going to use it for doing a DRM packet debug logger... to try
and trace hangs in the system, using printk doesn't really help as
guess what it slows the machine down so much that your races don't
happen... I wrote some basic code for this already.. and I'm hoping to
use some work time to get it finished at some stage...
Dave.
