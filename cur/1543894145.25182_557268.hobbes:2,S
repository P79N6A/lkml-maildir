Hi Jeff,
Is there a patch in particular I can maybe apply? I see you made a
couple of commits ... my problem is this is also happening on one of my
production boxes which has a few other patches applied, I'm a bit scared
of conflicts ... I don't really want to break anything by upgrading the
kernel.
Kind Regards
Nigel
