The pixel clock (and thus both H and V sync) will be slower than
requested, so if you set the minimum allowed the display may not
sync. In case of really old CRT display it could theoretically
damage it.
I'm using it with PAL TV (using RGB input - SCART connector) and
the bug prevented it from working at all (TV requirements are more
strict and made the bug visible).
I think 2.6.22 would be overkill, .23 - not sure.
