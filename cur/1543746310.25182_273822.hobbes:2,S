Thanks for the suggestion.. I'm doing a burn-in right now with 8k
stacks, and so far, so good.
I'm building this system with stability and flexibility foremost in
mind. Am I foolish in using all of these technologies with a new-ish
version of 2.6? Is there a particular version that would be better
suited for my application? Any other suggestions you (or anyone else
on the list) could give regarding stability would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
