The modules rewrite highlighted a *lot* of bugs, which had nothing
to do with modules whatsoever. It was unfortunate for Rusty that his
work got merged the same time as a lot of other changes went in
which broke a lot of stuff (The cli/sti stuff springs to mind).
It also highlighted another bunch of bugs which were *real problems*
like using code marked __init after it was freed.
The "This doesn't compile, Rusty sucks" brigade then appeared,
not taking a second to realise that said driver was fscked regardless
of Rusty's code being merged.
Sure the modules rewrite wasn't painless, and like everything that
gets merged, there were bugs, but give the guy a break already.[1]
If there are still problems with modules, let Rusty know about it.
If not, please STFU already, its getting tiring hearing the same
old FUD.
