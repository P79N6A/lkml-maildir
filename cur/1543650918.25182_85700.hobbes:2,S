Well, I had to pick something and using the first is easier to implement, 
it's just different to cml1, which used the last definition.
BTW xconfig is a nice way to see how the config back end works, you can 
enable "Show All Options" and above entry will also be visible and you can 
watch how the value changes depending on the inputs.
BTW2 in the future above can be simplified into
config FS_MBCACHE
	tristate
	depends on EXT2_FS_XATTR || EXT3_FS_XATTR
	default EXT2_FS || EXT3_FS
bye, Roman
