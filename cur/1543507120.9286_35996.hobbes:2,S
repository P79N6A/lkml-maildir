What really is this feature ?(stupid question)
The problem for me is that when compiling this ( in 2.3.15 but I think
that this should happen the same in 2.3.14, I didn't try ) mthe kernel
won't boot.
After saying:
Found PIIX4 ACPI device at xxxx
stops with 
VFS: Cannot mount root filesystem on (03:04)
The system is a RH6 on a Mendocino 333 / TekramBX MB with
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xf000-0xf007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xf008-0xf00f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
hda: QUANTUM FIREBALLP KA9.1, ATA DISK drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
hda: QUANTUM FIREBALLP KA9.1, 8809MB w/371kB Cache, CHS=1123/255/63,UDMA(33)
Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077
Partition check:
 hda: hda1 hda2 < hda5 hda6 > hda3 hda4
After removing the PIIX4 ACPI thing from Misc Devices the system boots up
ok. (well, kind off, but it's working right now)
Also a strange thing is this :
[root@neruro /proc]# cat /proc/pci
cat: /proc/pci: Bad file descriptor
