Just to say that the patch (including added 4) fixed the "card reports no 
resources" messages for me. - Looking at my logs the messages appeared once 
every 10-40 minutes. - Now the box is up for more than 5 hours with the 
patch and test12-pre7 and not a single no resources message logged so far. 
(Note, I upgraded the kernel at the same time as adding the patch so it is 
actually possible that test12-pre7 vanilla is fixed as well.)
My card is an Ether Express Pro 100, lcpci says: Intel Corporation 82557 
[Ethernet Pro 100] (rev 04) and lspci -n gives: class 0200: 10b7:9004
Just my 2p.
