Ok, that bno (16777216) is a definite sign of corruption
caused by the 2.6.17.x (x <=6) kernels.

I wasn't suggesting that you use this kernel - that could cause more
corruption to occur.  What I was asking is if you have run a kernel
of this version in the past (i.e. before you upgraded to 2.6.18.3)?
Regardless, I suggest you get the latest xfsprogs and run xfs_repair
on your filesystems to fix the problem.
Cheers,
Dave.
