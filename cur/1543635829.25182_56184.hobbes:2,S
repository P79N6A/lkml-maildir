oprofile gives access to cpu performance counters on x86.
I ran oprofile with the individual lmbench tests to get
data from several of the counters.  This "hot kernel 
function" and counter info may be useful.  A web page with the
results from 5 of the performance counters for each
lmbench test is at:
http://home.earthlink.net/~rwhron/kernel/lmbench_oprofile.html
I'll add the rest of the counter data over the next few days.
Comments/caveats on how to make the information more useful are
welcome.
The target kernel was 2.4.19rc1aa1 on an Athlon 1333.
