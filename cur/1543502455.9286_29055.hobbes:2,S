This will not work. You can't use the filehandle, since it is not
unique to the inode (consider hard links).
The reason why I didn't go for a hashing scheme (but, for the moment,
allow aliasing of inode number) is because you cannot map a 64-bit
value uniquely onto 32-bits. Hashing will force you to alias inode
numbers at least as often as a direct map (it will probably occur more
often if the server is using 32-bit fileid values).
My current NFSv3 patches therefore rely on the 128-bit fsid+fileid to
identify the file on the NFS server side, and the pointer to the inode
structure to label it on the Linux side.
The inode number cannot be guaranteed to identify files uniquely on
NFSv3 until we make it a 64-bit value. I haven't done that since it
would entail a lot more work in maintaining patches, and would break
libc et al...
Cheers,
