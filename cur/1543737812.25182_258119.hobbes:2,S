The warning is caused by calling enable_irq()
when the interrupt enable depth is already 0
(interrupt is already enabled).
A couple of people, including me, have reported
this warning. The adapter continues to work.
My understanding of the problem is that it
is a warning only.
Do you see the interrupt count from /proc/interrupts
for the e100 increasing?
