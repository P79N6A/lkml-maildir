AIX select() allows you to wait on message queues as well as FDs.
One thing that I have always thought would be useful is some kind of
`serialise_access()', this would allow one process after another to lock
some shared resource -- in the order that they joined the queue.  Part
of the purpose is to remove the wake_everything_up approach that leads
to the ``thundering herds'', but also means that it is possible that
something waits a *very* long time before it gets it's turn on a popular
resouce.
