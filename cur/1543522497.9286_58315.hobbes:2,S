Oops, I'm being dense here.
For unsigned int, the compiler may write `a & 0x0fffffff'.  The standard
is precise.  It talks about powers of two and modulo arithmetic.
For signed int, the compiler also has that option: Non-negative signed
values less than a certain value as left shifted and right shifted just
as the unsigned quantities.  For left shift, negative values and values
large enough to overflow after shifting gives undefined behaviour.
(E.g. an overflow trap is possible)  For right shift, negative values
gives implementation defined behaviour.
For the case that started this thread, the behaviour is well defined on
all ISO C compilers, and even more so with GCC.  When `u32' is narrower
than `unsigned int', the top bit is not cleared, otherwise it is.
