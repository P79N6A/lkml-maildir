  i was wondering if anyone had seen this error when employing the BusLogic
  BT-958 PCI SCSI using driver version 2.0.14, the disk is an IBM Ultra Star
  18XP ( non-SCA ), and the kernel is 2.0.35.
  the error text is:
  17:37:08 master kernel: SCSI disk error : host 0 channel 0 id 6 lun 0 return code = 28000002 
  17:37:08 master kernel: extra data not valid Current error sd08:10: sense key Hardware Error 
  17:37:08 master kernel: Additional sense indicates Internal target failure 
  17:37:08 master kernel: scsidisk I/O error: dev 08:10, sector 2, absolute sector 2
The Hardware Error / Internal Target Failure is a report from the disk drive
itself, so I would think this has to be an issue with the drive, not the host
adapter.  I suggest you inquire of IBM what this might mean.
