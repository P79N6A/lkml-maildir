A popup hardly ever makes sense - popups generally are a
bad user interface. The user will have to dismiss the popup -
every time - whether he needs the warning or not.
But feel free to print a warning somewhere, such as a
status line. The warning itself is useful, but not something
we will have to dismiss in order to go on with the job.
