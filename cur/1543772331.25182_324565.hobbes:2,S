Hi,
I have intermittent kernel lockups (happensabout once a week).
It happens with all kernels I have on the machine  (fedora
kernels 2.6.9... through 2.6.11). Once it happens I can only reboot 
the computer using Alt-SysRq key.
I happened to be in the terminal window during one of the lockups, and
kernel gave out some info, but most of it scrolled off the screen
(nothing went to /var/log/messages). Similarly, trying to get info with
Alt-SysRq does not help because most of the info is off the screen.
I do not have an easy way to redirect this output somewhere through the
serial
port.
I would appreciate any help in either capturing the output of Alt-SysRq
or more generally diagnosing the problem. I will recompile the kernel
if needed for diagnostics.
Please cc the answer to shirman@lanl.gov
Thanks,
Yuri Shirman
