-	  Say Y here if you want to attach PCMCIA- or PC-cards to your FR-V
-	  board.  These are credit-card size devices such as network cards,
-	  modems or hard drives often used with laptops computers.  There are
-	  actually two varieties of these cards: the older 16 bit PCMCIA cards
-	  and the newer 32 bit CardBus cards.  If you want to use CardBus
-	  cards, you need to say Y here and also to "CardBus support" below.
-
-	  To use your PC-cards, you will need supporting software from David
-	  Hinds pcmcia-cs package (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
-	  for location).  Please also read the PCMCIA-HOWTO, available from
-	  <
http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.
-
-	  To compile this driver as modules, choose M here: the
-	  modules will be called pcmcia_core and ds.
