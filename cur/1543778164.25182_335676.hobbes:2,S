One easier way of doing development, particularly for people doing
filesystem work, is to compile the kernel with the test filesystem
code using user-mode linux (UML) architecture.  This significantly
shortens your edit-compile-debug cycle time, and it makes it easier to
run your filesystem code under a debugger.  That way you also don't
have to worry about your filesystem changes toasting your system,
either.  This technique doesn't work all that well for people doing
architecture-specific code or for device drivers, but for filesystems,
it's ideal.
