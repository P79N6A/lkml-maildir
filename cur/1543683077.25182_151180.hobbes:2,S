I know damn well that 2.6.0-test1 is not running r578 of the ohci1394
driver. In fact, that's 10 months old.
Try sending some of this info to linux1394-devel@lists.sf.net. I'm
running current code with 2.4.22-pre's and 2.6.0-test. SBP2 and eth1394
or working well. Haven't tried DV inawhile, but I know the stack is
working.
