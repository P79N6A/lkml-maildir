I am not running this crap (at least for a 24x7 server :)
I am almost sure it is the race condition already solved in pre-4 
mentioned by Linus some threads ago and also by Ingo in a reply to my
message.
I couldn't reproduce the lock yet, even doing many make -j xx over the
kernel source. I am scared the server will die when I'm doing some
physiological activities..., should I try other tests?
