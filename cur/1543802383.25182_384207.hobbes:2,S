By "die", I didn't mean "delete it from kernel sources".
It is very probable that over time, the "winning" stack will contain 
most drivers for the most common hardware, and the "losing" one just a 
few obscure ones. The "losing" one will still be available for people 
using hardware only supported by that stack.
Like the OSS/Alsa or XFree3.x/XFree4.x situations.
