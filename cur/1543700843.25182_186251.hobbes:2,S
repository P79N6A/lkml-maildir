I know it isn't the recommended compiler, heck it isn't even released
yet, but I was messing around with a GCC 3.4 snapshot, and figured I'd
give compiling the 2.6.0 kernel a shot.
Other than the constant barrage of warnings about the use of compound
expressions as lvalues being deprecated* (mostly because of lines 114,
116, and 117 of rcupdate.h, which is included everywhere), the build
goes very well.
It isn't until the final link that I get an error.  It seems that
something goes funny with the ACPI's use of strcpy.  I get undefined
references to strcpy in:  acpi_bus_generate_event (twice),
acpi_power_add, acpi_thermal_add, and acpi_bus_add.  There may be
additional different locations, but the error output stops there.
As I said, I'm just messing around, and figured I'd let everyone know
what's in the pipeline.  But if it is a simple fix, I'll give any
changes anyone wants to try a shot.
*It also doesn't like cast or conditional expressions as lvalues.
