Can be. But does something sensible without it.

Not sure what you mean. Load kernel, load xmms. hit play. Sound comes out.
Goodness.

Yeah. But the default options now do something non-confusing.

Umm. This discussion is exactly about the end-user experience.
And it's not a transient default ... it's the initial default.

So we can fix it in userspace, and decided a sensible non-zero default
there, but are somehow incapable of doing that *inside* the kernel? Sorry,
I don't buy that. 
There is a middle ground between "clueless newbie" and "geek who spends
their whole life configuring Linux, and is happy to change 2000 settings on
every install" ... something like "person who just wants to get on with it,
and not fiddle endlessly with things that should just work".

The old "document the bugs" arguement. I've been there before - Dynix/PTX.
We ended up with 1000 pages of utter crap for users to wade through as
"release notes". I got into the habit of taking a printed out copy to
meetings and whenever anyone uttered the phrase "but it's documented in the
release notes" I could thump the monster down on the table and say "find
it". They never could by the end of the meeting.
Bugs should be fixed, not documented.
