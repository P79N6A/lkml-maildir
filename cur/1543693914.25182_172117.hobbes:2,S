Subject: non-modular 2.6 ppc kernels miscompiled by gcc-3.3.1?

When I compile a non-modular 2.6 kernel for ppc with gcc-3.3.1,
it oopses in __copy_tofrom_user() [copy_mount_options()] in
user-space's first mount /proc call. User-space limps along
for a while, oopsing in every mount call, and then hangs.
This occurs with 2.6.0-test5, test6, and the test7-based
linuxppc-2.5 tree (rsync:ed today).
Enabling CONFIG_MODULES=y but still keeping everything built-in
prevents the oopses.
With gcc-3.2.3 there are no problems.
I don't have a serial console to the ppc box (weird mac serial
port), but I can try to manually type down and decode the first
oops if necessary.
