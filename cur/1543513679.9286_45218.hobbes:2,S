Here is a script that reproduces the problem for me.
I don't know if it requires you to have a double mount (an NFS mount
under another NFS mount), but it seems to work perfectly in my setup
here.
Put this script in the exported directory on the server and run it on the
server:
--- growfile.sh (or whatever) ---
#!/bin/bash
head -c1m /dev/zero > growfile
while true ; do
   head -c12 /dev/zero >> growfile
done
---
On the client, cat or cp growfile to /dev/null.  Viola.  I'm testing this
over 100 Mbit ethernet with the userspace NFS daemon.  The first time I
tried the "cp", ^C worked after a few seconds.  The second time, it
blocked completely and still hasn't unblocked.  "ps l" shows
"wait_on_page", and "echo 0 > /proc/sys/sunrpc/rpc_debug" shows similar
output as before.
My mount options are:
foo:/ on /foo type nfs (rw,soft,intr,nolock,timeo=8,retrans=8,rsize=4096,wsize=4096,addr=192.168.143.1)
foo:/d1 on /foo/d1 type nfs (rw,soft,intr,nolock,timeo=8,retrans=8,rsize=4096,wsize=4096,addr=192.168.143.1)
(I was testing in the directory /foo/d1/ ...)
