On different architectures, we have the following values for 
COMMAND_LINE_SIZE:
- 256
- 512
- 896
- 1024
- 4096
What should be the common value?
4096?
And I have a rough memory of some dependencies of COMMAND_LINE_SIZE and 
boot loaders. What exactly must be taken care of when increasing 
COMMAND_LINE_SIZE?
