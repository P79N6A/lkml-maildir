this was a bug in the critical-section-latency measurement code of x64.  
The timer irq is the one that leaves userspace running for the longest 
time, between two kernel calls.
I have fixed these bugs in -rc4-rt1, could you try it? It should report 
much lower latencies, regardless of PM settings.
