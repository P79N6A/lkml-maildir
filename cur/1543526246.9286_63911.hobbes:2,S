Two things I have thought about doing...
CONFIG_EMBEDDED -- turn on options which help you slim down the system a
lot.  Lets you disable devrandom, make drivers read-only (ditch write
support for space), etc.
CONFIG_DEBUGGING -- so many drivers have debug options, and some put
them into Config.in switches.  Hide these with CONFIG_DEBUGGING...
