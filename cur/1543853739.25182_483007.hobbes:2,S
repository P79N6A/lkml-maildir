When I started sending patches about all this, I proposed a whitelist
for PCI bridges and a blacklist for PCIe bridges, but Greg was against
whitelisting.
Now, reading this thread, I am very disturbed with the idea of disabling
MSI on all non-Intel bridges. Blacklisting correctly shouldn't be that
hard. From my point of view, there are several non-Intel bridges that
seem to support MSI very well (especially some HT<->PCIe bridges). And
apart from being required for ipath, MSI improves the performance of
network drivers a bit, so I'd rather keep it enabled on trusted bridges...
