According to Andi Kleen:

no, the counters you see with ifconfig eth0 are set to zero
for rx and to 1 for tx.
So it's trying to send out data but somehow it doesn't work.
Since the driver version is the same (althoud the output is
slihtly different which seems odd) i suspect the PCI
probing to be folded somewhere.
How could i provide people with more info ?
Thanks,
Danny
