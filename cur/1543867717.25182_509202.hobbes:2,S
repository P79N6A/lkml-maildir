Right, this means we can simply for ppc version down to:
+static __inline__ int local_add_return(int a, local_t *l)
+{
+	int t;
+
+	__asm__ __volatile__(
+"1:	PPC_LLARX	%0,0,%2		# local_add_return\n\
+	add	%0,%1,%0\n"
+	PPC405_ERR77(0,%2)
+"	PPC_STLCX	%0,0,%2 \n\
+	bne-	1b"
+	: "=&r" (t)
+	: "r" (a), "r" (&(l->a.counter))
+	: "cc", "memory");
+
+	return t;
+}
and that should work for both ppc32 & ppc64 and removes the  
duplication between the two.
