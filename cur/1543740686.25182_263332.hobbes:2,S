Can you explain me how you do this? call_usermodehelper() doesn't work for me 
at resume time.
BTW, I had a look at the radeon card's resume code at 0xc000:3 and attempted 
to implement it in a kernel module. The code is pretty simple, but it's quite 
long. My module isn't finished, it only turns off the display and resets the 
memory. I had to stop because I've a lot of things to do for school now.
Ole Rohne meant that the code is potentially dangerous because it pokes around 
with undocumented PLL registers, so I will not send it to the list: I will 
send it only to those who explicitly ask for it.
