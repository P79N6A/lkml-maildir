We could do something more efficient, but I thought that half the point
was that they didn't carry any of this extra memory, and they could be
really fast to set up at the expense of efficiency elsewhere.

If we fix the race in the linear mappings, then we can just do the full
msync for nonlinear vmas, and the fast noop version for everyone else.
I don't see it being a big deal. I doubt anybody is writing out huge
amounts of data via nonlinear mappings.
