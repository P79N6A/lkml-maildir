The solution is:
	Get a COMPLETE linux-2.6.0-test3.tar.bz2
and 
	DO NOT USE patch
I patched up the kernel from 2.5.20 or something and there seemed to be
an error somewhere on the way up. Getting a *clean* kernel tar file,
compile with the same .config, running.
This is the use of patches!
Best wishes
Norbert
