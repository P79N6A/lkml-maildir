Well, I don't know what happened but at least I can not reproduce
it any more. Very strange. Plain 2.2.9 is back to full speed again :)
Maybe something else caused this slowdown. I don't know. Maybe it
has something to do with my SMC Etherpower II cards. Sometimes I get
ping times of up to 20 seconds(!) while normaly ping times are ~0.3ms.
If this happens I have to reboot either my server or my client. 
What can I do to debug this if it happens again?
