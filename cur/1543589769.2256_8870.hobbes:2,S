Its a CompactPCI system from Ziatech. We have 2 computers in it. 1 Master
(host) and 1 Slave (local). The master one is a Ziatech 5502 and the slave
is a Ziatech 5541.
The slave computer is isolated from the pci bus with a non-transparent
pci-to-pci bridge : INTEL (DEC) 21554
Basicly I have to transmit data between the host and the local system by the
pci bus.
