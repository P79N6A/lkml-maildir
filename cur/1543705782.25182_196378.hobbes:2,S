(sigh) Just last night I had to reboot into 2.4 to use my new USB
scanner.
I tried for a while to get it working under 2.6.  I'm not exactly a
beginner at this stuff either.  
With 2.4 it took less than 30 seconds and worked perfectly, following
the SANE documentation instructions.  My user space is Fedora Core 1
with all available updates.
So, what are you all using / recommending for user space configuration
and control of a USB scanner under 2.6? 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/docs/post-halloween-2.6.txt
 doesn't say a
word about USB scanners, and I havn't seen the issue mentioned anywhere
else either.
