I have to say honestly that it is much easier to work in the i386 arch
directories than the x86_64. But that may be my own feelings.  You seem to
have a nice style that you like and think that it is cleaner. But it
doesn't really seem much cleaner to me. Somethings I like better with the
x86_64 code, and there's somethings I like better with the i386 code. But
from a comfort level, I have to go with worknig with the i386 code.

I think it helps a lot of people. Especially those that are trying to add
things to _both_ i386 and x86_64.

Not sure what you mean here?  I would think that we have this "double
maintence" anyway.  Fixes that are done in x86_64 probably should also be
done in i386.  Why have it in two places?

hehe, I'm seeing a bunch of bugs and quirks appear.  It's just that
x86_64 isn't as old as i386 to have as many of them. But give it time.

That was not the point of this patch. This patch was to unify the two so
that we can get started on the unification.

Did you read what tglx wrote?  The point of this patch was to keep
everything the _same_.  The fact that not a single line less code
duplication is a feature.  A great starting point where we can easily
trace things back to the current arch separation, as well as move forward
in merging the two.
