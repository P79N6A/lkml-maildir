Hi,
i already use 2.4 for some time. the thing that bugs me is the 'used' figures 
go up, and no processes actually use that memory (not the buffered/cached, 
well, they go up , but thats normal) , so it seems the memory is 'lost' 
somewhere, and i don't see any processes using it up, and 200 meg ram in 70 
seconds is a lot ...
So or i am misinterpreting something, or i am completely clueless, or there 
is a leak somewhere..
greetings,
Frank
