beats me.  just FYI, it's not like this would be a massive change --
here's the entire collection of candidates for conversion over to
__get_dma_pages():
$ grep -r "get_free.*GFP_DMA" *
arch/s390/kernel/smp.c:                 __get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL | GFP_DMA,
drivers/net/arm/ep93xx_eth.c:           page = (void *)__get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL | GFP_DMA);
drivers/net/arm/ep93xx_eth.c:           page = (void *)__get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL | GFP_DMA);
drivers/s390/net/qeth_main.c:                   ptr = (void *) __get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL|GFP_DMA);
drivers/s390/net/claw.c:                        (void *)__get_free_pages(__GFP_DMA,
drivers/s390/net/claw.c:                        (void *)__get_free_pages(__GFP_DMA,
drivers/s390/net/claw.c:                   p_buff=(void *)__get_free_pages(__GFP_DMA,
drivers/s390/net/claw.c:                        (void *)__get_free_pages(__GFP_DMA,
drivers/s390/net/claw.c:                        p_buff = (void *)__get_free_pages(__GFP_DMA,
drivers/s390/block/dasd.c:      device->ccw_mem = (void *) __get_free_pages(GFP_ATOMIC | GFP_DMA, 1);
drivers/s390/char/tty3270.c:                    __get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL|GFP_DMA, 0);
drivers/s390/char/sclp_cpi.c:   sccb = (struct cpi_sccb *) __get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL | GFP_DMA);
drivers/s390/cio/cmf.c:         mem = (void*)__get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL | GFP_DMA,
lib/swiotlb.c:          io_tlb_start = (char *)__get_free_pages(GFP_DMA | __GFP_NOWARN,
lib/swiotlb.c:  io_tlb_overflow_buffer = (void *)__get_free_pages(GFP_DMA,
sound/oss/sscape.c:             start_addr = (char *) __get_free_pages(GFP_ATOMIC|GFP_DMA, sz);
sound/oss/hal2.c:       codec->buffer = (unsigned char *)__get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL | GFP_DMA,
sound/oss/dmabuf.c:             start_addr = (char *) __get_free_pages(GFP_ATOMIC|GFP_DMA|__GFP_NOWARN, sz);
  and, obviously, it's not worth doing anything under sound/.  so
we're not talking enormous cleanup or anything.
