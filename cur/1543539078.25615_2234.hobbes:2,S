For some time now (haven't tested with the latest) my tulip chip works with
the de4x5 driver but not the tulip driver.  But if I compile in both, the tulip
driver claims the chip.
I think I have a DEC 21143 chip.
The screwy thing is the tulip driver did work sometime in the past when I pulled
a development version off the author's web page and put it in a 2.2.13 kernel.
Whatever did work doesn't work anymore.
It's not that big a problem because I can use the other driver.  But it is
confusing, because the tulip driver which doesn't work says it should work for
my chip.
