Dear diary, on Tue, Apr 12, 2005 at 10:39:40AM CEST, I got a letter

Well, yes, but the last merge point search may not be so simple:
A --1---2----6---7
B    \   `-4-.  /
C     `-3-----5'
Now, when at 7, your last merge point is not 1, but 2.
What I have proposed at the git mailing list was to have simple merging
tracking - merges/branch1/branch2 directory structure which would store
merges from branch2 to branch1. Then, when merging say to branch3, you
traverse all of them and if any of the branch1/* commits is newer than
branch3/*, you update it.
The disadvantage is that you now need to strictly use gitmerge.sh to do
the merges - Linus' revtree solution is nicer in the regard that it
works without any explicit bookkeeping, and tracks any merges properly
recorded with commit-file; it is more complex and more expensive,
though.

98% of the time I am right. Why worry about the other 3%.
