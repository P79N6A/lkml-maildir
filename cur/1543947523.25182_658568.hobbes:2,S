Take a look at git-new-workdir in git's contrib directory. I'm using it a
lot now. It makes it possible to set up as many workdirs as you want, sharing
the same repo. It's very dangerous if you're not rigorous, but it saves a lot
of time when you work on several branches at a time, which is even more true
for a project's documentation. The real thing to care about is not to have
the same branch checked out at several places.
