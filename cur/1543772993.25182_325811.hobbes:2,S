A long, long time ago, Crispin defined LSM's purpose as:

Since IMA provides support for a new type of security policy,
specifically remote system integrity verification, I don't see
where LSM shouldn't necessarily be used.
I'm also curious about the current kernel development approach:
On the one hand, when filesystem auditing was introduced, Christoph
asked whether inotify and audit should be merged because they hook
some of the same places.  Can someone reconcile these points of view
for me, please?  If Reiner goes ahead and moves the IMA code straight
into the kernel, does anyone doubt that he'll be asked to merge it
with LSM?
I'm not pushing one way or the other - I don't care whether IMA is
an LSM or not :)  I just don't understand the current climate.
thanks,
