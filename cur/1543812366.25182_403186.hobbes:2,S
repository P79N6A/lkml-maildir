Since my HP notebook has some unrecognized keys, I have to use setkeycodes to
make the kernel recognise them. However, many of the basic (<=255) KEY's from
input.h are not suitable, but newer ones (>=0x100) woule be perfect.
Any idea how to map scancodes to keycodes >=0x100 when setkeycodes won't
accept hex input nor anything greater than 255?
Regards,
Ian Morgan
