Especially since patches in question had been written by Jens Axboe (who
has nothing to RH) and announced (many times) on l-k.
I've fixed several races in Jens' patch and fed them back to him. His patch
+ these fixes were the only loop-related patches in RH tree[1]. Until fixes got
merged into Jens' loop-6 which, in turn, was merged into -ac and into
the main tree, that is.
I don't give a flying fsck through the rolling doughnut for "their" track
record (whatever "their" means), but I'm somewhat partial to mine. Care to
grep through l-k archives, check your facts and STFU?

[1] there's also changeloop patch - adds an ioctl for switching the underlying
file under opened /dev/loop; API is ugly and thing has so limited use that
IMO it should die. Completely unrelated to the problems in question, anyway.
