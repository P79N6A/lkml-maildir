OK ... you're right ;-) This is bad, especially for distribution
kernels. So I just need something to stop the NUMA-Q crashing.
Can I have the appended? Please, please, please? ;-)
It just adds an if switch to irq_balance which the compiler
optimises away anyway. Not a whiff of a config option. 
Tested on 2.5.31.
