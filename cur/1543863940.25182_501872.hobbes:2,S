Does it actually need to use the _safe variant?  That's only needed if the
body of the loop can do list_del() and afaict that doesn't happen here.

That's not exactly a thing of beauty, sorry ;)
Given that the code is single-threaded here, there's nothing to race
against and I don't think we strictly need any locking at all.  But
consistency is OK.  Given the locking here I'm not sure that the code would
be safe against concurrent removes anyway.
A more idiomatic implementation would do:
	while (!list_empty(&efivar_list)) {
		struct efivar_entry *entry = list_entry(...);
		list_del(...)
	}
Anyway.  Stuff to think about on a rainy day...
