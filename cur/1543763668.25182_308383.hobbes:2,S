For benchmarks like these, the issue isn't the storage capacity, but
rather the ability to have lots of heads seeking concurrently to
access the many database tables.  At one large site I used to work at,
the database ran on hundreds of 1, 2, and 4GB disks long after they
could be replaced by many fewer, larger disks...
