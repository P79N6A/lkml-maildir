That's interesting, albeit non-scientific, I think it is quite informative.
There are two basic problems with the current code: speed is down by  
around and order of magnitude compared to a non-synced write and the fact  
that the code is hammering the FAT.  The two are obviously related.
Viewing the system globally rather than considering the details of the  
techniques used, it would seem that any algorithm that does not  
drastically reduce write times, at least on the one large file test , is  
missing the mark and presumably repeating the problem in a slightly  
different way.
Not knocking the efforts Chris has put in , it's great to see this is  
getting some attention, but I think viewing overall performance times as  
shown above gives a touchstone as to whether any particular proto is  
effective.
The fact that flush can be almost 40% slower in some cases is worrying.
Thanks for the info.
