Cool! very welcome.
Can you do me a favor and submit a diff of all the tulip changes
you have at this point back to lkml (and whatever other lists are cc'd)?
jgarzik might accept your bits and ignore the parts that have been
submitted/rejected before.  But whatever you post will get archived
with this thread for others to find in the future.
thanks,
grant
