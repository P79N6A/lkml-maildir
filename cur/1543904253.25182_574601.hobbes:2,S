What is "this problem"? People have an updatedb problem that is solved
by swap prefetching which I want to fix in a different way.
There would be a different problem of "run something that uses heaps of
memory and swap everything else out, then quit it, wait for a while, and
swap prefetching helps". OK, definitely swap prefetching would help there.
How much? I don't know. I'd be slightly surprised if it was like an order
of magnitude, because not only swap but everything else has been thrown
out too.

And yet despite my repeated pleas, none of those people has yet spent a
bit of time with me to help analyse what is happening.

I don't think any further proof is needed that the patch does "some"
good. Rig up a test case and you could see some seconds shaved off it.
Maybe you want to know "how to get this patch merged"? And I don't know
that one. I do know that it is fuzzy, and probably doesn't include
demanding things of Andrew or Linus.
BTW. If you find out the answer to that one, let me know because I have
this lockless pagecache patch that has also been around for years, is
also just a few hundred lines in the VM, and does do some good too. I'm
sure the buffered AIO people and many others would also like to know.
