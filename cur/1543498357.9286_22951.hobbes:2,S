    However, with devfs you can definately avoid the lookups into the
    major tables. Right now that's fast because they're simple arrays. If
    we go to 12 bit majors (or more), we're going to want to set them up
    as lists of some kind. And that means some kind of searching/hashing.
    And that's all for the benefit of finding our fops. Devfs completely
    avoids this overhead.
No. A kdev_t is a pointer to a structure that has various fields.
Not:
	blksize[MAJOR(dev)]
but
	dev->major->blksize
