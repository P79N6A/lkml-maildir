Comments:
1) Interrupt handler should use the much-less-expensive spin_lock(). 
spin_lock_irqsave() is only used where two separate interrupts (legacy 
IDE irqs 14 & 15) could be sharing the same interrupt handler.
2) Don't pass the hotplug register offset as an argument to a function. 
  Add the offset as a member of struct pdc_port_priv.
This eliminates the need to split up the interrupt handler as you have done.
3) Don't comment out ATA_FLAG_SATA, it is a SATA controller :)

P.S.  Watch for the SiI hotplug email I'm about to send, too...
