Given a trace including :
- Swapfiles initially used
- multiple swapon/swapoff
- swap in/out events
We would like to be able to tell which swap file the information has
been written to/read from at any given time during the trace.
Therefore, I dump the swap file information at the beginning of the
trace (see the ltt_dump_swap_files function) and also follow each
swapon/swapoff.
The minimal information that has to be saved at each swap read/write
seems to be the struct file * that is used by the operation. We can then
map back to the file used by knowing the mapping between struct file *
and associated file names (dump/swapon/swapoff instrumentation).
The swp_entry_t->type does not seem to map to any specific information
in /proc/swaps ? (or I may have missed a detail) Even if it does, it is
limited to a specific point in time and does not follow swapon/swapoff
events.
You are talking about ordering in /proc/swaps : I wonder what happens if
we add/remove swap files from the array : I guess the swp_entry_t
ordering may become mixed up with the order of the /proc/swaps output,
since it is based on the swap_info array which will fill empty spots
upon swapon (again, unless I missed a clever detail).
