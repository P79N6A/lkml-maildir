Disabling support in the kernel at compile time makes any difference ?
Unfortunately I don't have any SMP hardware to try to reproduce this
problem.

This is important. The driver has some differences between the two
versions, but none of them is releated to SMP. I'll chack again, but if
someone with some more smp-karma than me wants to join, he is most
welcome...
So I'm leaning towards blaming a problem outside the sis900 driver
itself.
Thanks.
