If your 3C509B is in PNP mode then you should use isapnp to configure the
card.  Furthermore you should reserve the IRQ in the BIOS so that it is not
assigned to a PCI device, as far as I know Linux doesn't automatically
reassign PCI devices' IRQs to make room for PNP isa cards like Win9x does.
You best option though is to configure you 3C509B in ISA mode, as this mode
is fully compatable with Linux without the need to use isapnp and will work
equally well in Win9x as well.
