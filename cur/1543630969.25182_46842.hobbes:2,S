If read always returns the amount read (ignoring any copy_to_user
errors), then you can repeat it by seeking backwards[1] and redoing the
read.
So copy_to_user can simply deliver a SIGSEGV and return "success", and
everything will work (except sockets, pipes, etc).
Is this satisfactory?  I'd really like to get rid of 5,500 code paths
in the kernel...
BTW, SuSv3/POSIX.1.2001 says it's OK,
Rusty.
[1] No, this won't work on pipes & sockets, but the whole idea won't
work on many devices anyway...
