Actually, we're changing policy on Feb 15.  Our lawyer adviced us to
give some space between filing the paperwork and letting it take
effect.
The biggest issue in the new U.S. regulations is the "foreign
government" provision.  I intend to file a comment recommending that
this provision be removed, since it is inherently unworkable.  This
provision prohibits someone in the U.S. from "knowingly" export to a
foreign government end-user (*any* foreign government, not just T-7.)
This is of course idiotic, since it just takes someone *else* in that
country downloading the stuff and giving to their government -- or the
government getting an ISP account making them look like someone else.
Whomever does that would be breaking U.S. law, but that's meaningless
since they're outside U.S. jurisdiction.
[N.B.: I'm not a lawyer.  Thanks God.]
