That's already taken care of with David's first patch.  There's no
reason we can't have an afsctlfs like the nfsctlfs.  But anyway,
please list the prototypes and usages of the subcalls here, maybe
some of them are generally usefull.
This kind of "I need a stuff fr a random syscall multiplexer"
requests are silly. APIs need review or you'll get the syssgi syndrome
really soon..
