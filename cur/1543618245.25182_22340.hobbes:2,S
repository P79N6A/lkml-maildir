Subject: [patch] amd athlon cooling on kt266/266a chipset
hi there!
a few month ago someone has posted a patch for enabling the disconneect
on STPGND detect function in the kt133/kt133a chipset. for those who
don't
know what this does: it sets a bit in a register of the northbridge of
the
chipset to enable the power saving modes of the athlon/duron/athlon xp
prozessors.
i did not found any patch which enables this function on an kt266/kt266a
board. so i modified this patch (
http://groups.google.com/groups?q=via_disconnect&hl=en&selm=linux.kernel
.20010903002855.A645%40gondor.com&rnum=1
)
to support the kt266 and kt266a chipset to.
now i am looking for people to test the patch and repord, whether it
works
allright on other computers than my computer (i tested this patch on an
epox 8kha+ whith an xp1600+).
if you want to test this patch:
1. first apply the patch
2. enable generel-setup -> acpi , acpi-bus-maager , prozessor
   in the kernel config
3. add to the "append" line in /etc/lilo.conf the "amd_disconnect=yes"
statemand (or after reboot enter at the kernel-boot-prompt
"amd_disconnect=yes")
4. build a knew kernel
5. report to me, whether you have problems ...
if the patch gets a good feedback, maybe it is something for the
official
kernel tree ?
