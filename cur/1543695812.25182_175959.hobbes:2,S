John,
It does not appear that the kernel(s) will support the root fs on
tmpfs.  Looking through the init kernel code:  It boils down to a block
device with real major and minor number or NFS.
Could you set up a ramdisk to do the same thing as /dev/shm?  Also,
you'll have to tell the kernel where root is, either a boot parameter
(root=xxx) or with the rdev command.
