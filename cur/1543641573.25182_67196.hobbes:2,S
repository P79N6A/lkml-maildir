You will NOT.
The page_table_lock protects against page stealing of the VM and
concurrent page-faults, nothing else.  There is no way you can get
contention on it under any reasonable load that doesn't involve heavy
out-of-memory behaviour, simply because
 - the lock is per-mm
 - all "regular" paths that care about this also get the mmap semaphore
In short, that spinlock has _zero_ scalability impact.  You can
theoretically get contention on it without memory pressure only by
having hundreds of threads page-faulting at the same time (getting a
read-lock on the mmap semaphore), but by then your performance has
nothing to do with the spinlock, and everything to do with the page
faults themselves. 
(In fact, I can almost guarantee that most of the long hold-times are
for exit(), not for munmap().  And in that case the spinlock cannot get
any non-pagestealer contention at all, since nobody else is using the
MM)
