Subject: cs46xx doesn't play sounds correctly (was Re: Linux 2.2.17pre12)

I've installed 2.2.17pre13 on an HP Kayak XU800. Loading the cs46xx
reports the following:
Crystal 4280/461x + AC97 Audio, version 0.01, 22:14:49 Jul 24 2000
PCI: Enabling bus mastering for device 01:28
cs461x: Card found at  0xfd7fd000 and 0xfd600000, IRQ 9
ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, vendor id1: 0x4352, id2: 0x5903 (Cirrus
Logic CS4297)
cs461x: Found 1 audio device(s).
  The PCI BIOS has not enabled the device at 1/88!  Updating PCI
command 0113->0117.
This is on RH6.1, with the following alias in conf.modules:
	alias sound cs46xx
Unfortunately, it doesn't always play sounds correctly (e.g. the
Windows login fanfare under VMware). The sound is but is typically
distorted/choppy and possibly skewed towards the higher frequencies.
The following message is logged after some sample sounds:
  cs461x: drain_dac, dma timeout?
The kernel was configured with "CONFIG_SOUND_FUSION=m".
lspci -v gives:
01:05.0 Multimedia audio controller: Cirrus Logic CS 4614 (rev 01)
	Subsystem: Unknown device 1013:4280
	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 56, IRQ 9
	Memory at fd7fd000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
	Memory at fd600000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
	Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 2
A colleague has working sound on one of these machines using the
ALSA driver installation, but that is a complexity we'd rather
avoid for distribution to our end-users.
Any suggestions to make this work correctly?
Thanks,
	Barrie
