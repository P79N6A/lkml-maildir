For what it's worth I'll chime in with my own info on this subject.
I also see the 
   spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
messages from time to time. Actually I got one just a little while ago : 
   $ dmesg | grep spurious
   [18994.222451] spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
The system seems to be in good shape - it has never caused me any
actual trouble.
As for the via irq fixup I see this :
   $ dmesg | grep -i fixup
   [   74.629393] PCI: Via PIC IRQ fixup for 0000:00:09.0, from 255 to 3
The hardware is a ASUS A7M266 mobo with a AMD Athlon (t-bird) 1.4GHz CPU.
The kernel is 2.6.12-rc4-mm2 : 
   $ uname -a
   Linux dragon 2.6.12-rc4-mm2 #2 Mon May 16 18:14:13 CEST 2005 i686
unknown unknown GNU/Linux
I've seen some references to APIC for this issue, so here are the APIC
related settings in my .config :
   juhl@dragon:~/download/kernel/linux-2.6.12-rc4-mm2$ grep -i APIC .config
   CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC=y
   # CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC is not set
