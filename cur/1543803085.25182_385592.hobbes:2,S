Hi Matt,
I wasn't trying to make it sound like this was an apples to apples
comparison, what I am saying is simply that locks aren't free.
You are totally right that fork/exec should be called a lot less
frequently, but the delay account data collection points will be in far
more places than that and they will all go for the lock.

I don't have a 512-way to play with at the moment, but again I don't
think it makes sense to benchmark things which aren't matching what we
are looking at. If we can avoid the locks in the first place then
there's really no reason for not doing that.

Yup, I was curious about that. I haven't had a chance to look at it
carefully yet.
Cheers,
Jes
