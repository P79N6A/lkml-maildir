But this is not true at all. This function doesn't come anywhere
on the panic codepath.

So I'd say we do need a:
WARN_ON(irqs_disabled() || in_interrupt());
or something right about here ...

And oh, by the way, you can safely go ahead and put that warning
in smp_call_function() *also*.
Note that panic() -> smp_send_stop() -> calls into the lower-level
__smp_call_function() directly.
So neither smp_call_function() nor smp_call_function_single() come
in the panic codepath -- the warnings there would be okay.
