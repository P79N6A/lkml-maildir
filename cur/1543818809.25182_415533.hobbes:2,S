The problem is not memory consumption but complexity of code/data structures.
Keeping information in two places is usually a good cue that something 
is wrong. This code is also fragile and hard to test.

I think i386 SRAT NUMA should be just removed at some point - it never
worked all that well and is quite complicated. That leaves IA64, x86-64
and ppc64.  I suspect keeping the code there near their low level
data structures is better.

For x86-64/i386. I haven't read the other architectures.

e.g. a generic size_zones(). Possibly some others.
