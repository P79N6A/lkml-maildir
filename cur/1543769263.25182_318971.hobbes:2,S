Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Proper MMC command classes support

The MMC block layer currently contains an if-clause which only seems to
serve the purpose of killing forward compatibility:
	if (card->csd.cmdclass & ~0x1ff)
		return -ENODEV;
This checks for (what I presume) command classes that were undefined
when this code was written. Since these are now starting to be used,
this code is causing a lot of problems. The following two patches tries
to make a more sane check of the command classes.
(Note. The new command class is for high speed cards to allow higher
transfer rates than normal)
