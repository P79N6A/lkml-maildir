The ACPI code's CPU-enumeration-only config option does what acpitable.[ch]
did. This has been in 2.5 for a long time, so this would unify the 2.4 and
2.5 approaches.
Is your concern with the code, or the cmdline option? We could certainly
keep the same cmdline option "acpismp=force" if that is the issue, but that
always seemed like kind of a strange name for the option, to me.
