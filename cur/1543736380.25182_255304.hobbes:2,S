I have recently purchased book "Linux Device Drivers"
By Alessandro Rubini. I am very keen to learn the
Kernel Programming and this is my step towards Kernel
Programming.
I request you to all to guide me whenever I get stuyck
up in my learning process. 
I was facing problem in loading a module example
hello.o in my Red Hat Linux Kernel 2.4.20-6.
It gives me an error that module has been compiled for
Kernel 2.4.20 and you are trying to run it on Kernel
2.4.20-6 [which is a kernel comes with Red Hat 9.0]
Please guide me over this issue so that I can proceed
further in learning process.
Thanks & Regards
Dinesh
