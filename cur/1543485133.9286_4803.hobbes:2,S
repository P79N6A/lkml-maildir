That'll do.   Some documentation would be nice, BTW - I pretty much
had to feel my way around Brian's contributions to figure out how they
worked, and then grovel through the Linux kernel source to figure out
some things he'd done in out-of-date ways.   I don't know if I got it
right by doing that, either.   Sigh.
