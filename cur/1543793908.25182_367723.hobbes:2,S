ftruncate64 works with O_DIRECT
ftruncate64 works w/o O_DIRECT
pwrite64 FAILS with O_DIRECT at ~4GB
pwrite64 works w/o O_DIRECT.
I am re-running these tests to confirm (could take a minute).
All opens are with O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_LARGEFILE.
All test over GbE w/ jumbo frames (8160 mtu) to a netapp filer (via x-over cable).
