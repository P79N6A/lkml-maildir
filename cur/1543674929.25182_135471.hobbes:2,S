Although I don't run the -bkXX releases, as far as I can see this is not
related to anything in Coda bug, but probably a missing change to slab.c.
A flag was added to the slabcache to identify reclaimable slabs. I can
see how this BUG would get triggered if your kernel was linked with an
old version of slab.o or is missing the SLAB_RECLAIM_ACCOUNT related
changes in slab.c.
Maybe "make clean ; make bzImage modules" will fix it?
