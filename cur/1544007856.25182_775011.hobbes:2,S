If it's configurable at all for tmpreaper (or similar), it should work
the same for tmpreaper in virtual machine containers.  (Same as,
e.g. utsname is different in containers).  If not now, someone will
have to patch it later.  Each VM runs it's own tmpreaper, configured
usually by separate people.
It's probably simpler to make it per-mountpoint than a virtualised global.
I don't see why there is an objection to per-mountpoint.
Andrew Morton's syntax: mount /dev/foo /mnt/bar -o relatime=86400
looks natural to me.
