I can look into the slowdown.  Could you please tell me exactly how you are
invoking the benchmark?  Show me what commands you're using, so I can do
exactly the same thing.

I have a bad feeling I won't be able to reproduce this.  If you could
capture the output from a sysrq-T (or "echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger") then
that would help a lot.
It could be a hole in the new dynamic request allocation code, or a driver
problem.  Or something else.
