Unfortunately it wasn't a simple "replace global irq with spinlocks" - some
code also got moved around so its not clear that the problem was fixed by
the spinlocks or the code reordering.  I'd rather know which it was.
In addition, holding a spinlock while calling request_irq is asking for
trouble.
