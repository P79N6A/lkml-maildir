Pardon me for asking a dumb and possibly impertinent question, but why 
keep it around at all?
In 2.6 it just seems like it's causing more problems than it's worth.  I 
mean, replacing ide-scsi with a simple 4-line driver would suffice...
int init_module(void)
{
	printk(KERN_INFO "fix your app to use SG_IO\n");
}
Since the major app, cdrecord, has already been fixed, that just leaves 
a few IMO minor apps out there that (a) should be using SG IO and (b) 
are depending on an unmaintained and perpetually broken driver anyway.

P.S. Yes, libata will probably (not definite) use the SCSI layer to 
drive ATAPI devices... but that's a long way off, and will not be using 
the ide-scsi code.  ide-scsi is basically a glue driver specifically for 
drivers/ide.
