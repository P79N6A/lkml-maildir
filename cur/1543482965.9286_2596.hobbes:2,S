hi-
 A buddy and I have noticed that network IP aliasing seems to have
disappeared in 2.2.
 The Tk kernel config script and master .config files still reference
this very important feature (CONFIG_IP_ALIAS and CONFIG_NET_ALIAS), but
ip_alias.c is gone from the source and makefiles.
 Is this intentional?  IP aliasing is a vital feature for machines such
as our plant gateway/nameserver, life would be -very- awkward without
this networking option...
