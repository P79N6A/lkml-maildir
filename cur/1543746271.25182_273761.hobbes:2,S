The lockup was caused by the mutex wakeup being done under the PI lock,
and if a new critical-section latency is reported within try_to_wake_up
then the trylock done there deadlocked. The NMI watchdog triggered but
the printks done there deadlocked as well.
I fixed both the deadlock scenario, and made the NMI printout path more
robust to get the messages out to the console in even such a case. 
The fixes are in the latest (-30-4) patch which can be found at the
usual place:
