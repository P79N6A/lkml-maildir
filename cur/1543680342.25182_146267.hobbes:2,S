I might be totally wrong, as I can only speak
for 2.4 (which has no ongoing/forgotten smalldevfs 
efford ;), but devfs has definitely divided the
users into two groups (think religion/war) ...
the group using devfs, usually doesn't care about
the 'compatibility' issue, the other doesn't care
at all ... so this isn't an issue at all ...

I'm hoping too, and I would like to see it on
2.6 as well as 2.4 ...
using 2.4 I'm currently bound to devfs, as I'm
one of the pro-devfs guys, and I think Richard
Gooch did a great work with it ... (maybe a 
little too much work actually ;)
best,
Herbert
