So i would prefer to leave this turned off. Infact i was hoping to take it
off for the final code submission. If you insist, it could be left there
and enabled during compile. There could be better ways to do it but
experimentation is required.
It will definetely help in the case of low and high speed devices.

IPV4 as well. In the case of V6 and V4 it is called ECN. causing
quiet a bit of havoc right now ;->
I can see the netif_rx() feedback clearly fitting in the 'receive
busy/not-ready' details you talked about earlier. I dont see the CN fit
clearly.
Maybe one way is to set the Frame Relay FECN bit after you return from
netif_rx()? callbacks? nah, too complicated...

Good idea.
There is some mapping e.g.
NET_RX_SUCCESS maps to BLG_CNG_NONE
NET_RX_DROP maps to BLG_CNG_DROP
NET_*_POLICED and NET_*_BYPASS have no proper mapping in the receive
path but we could define them as well
Only difference i see are that we will need several NET_RX_CN defines
because we have BLG_CNG_LOW, BLG_CNG_MOD and BLG_CNG_HIGH
so a NET_RX_CN_LOW, NET_RX_CN_MOD and NET_RX_CN_HIGH would complete it.

Doesnt sound like a bad idea. Maybe Davem and/or Alexey and/or Andi can
comment.

I think the initial idea with the transmit path (not sure how alive the
idea is) was to propagate the return codes from the link layer all the way
to the protocol layer. For example it would help TCP to know of 
NET_TXMIT_DROP to maybe doing something smarter than go into a FR or an
RTO.

What kind of Linux conference gives you no access to the internet? ;->
