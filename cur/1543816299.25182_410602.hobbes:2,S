There are reasons for zeroing indirect blocks on truncate: 
      * There are limits to the size of a single journal transaction
        (1/4 of the journal size). When truncating a large fragmented
        file, it may require modifying so many block bitmaps and group
        descriptors that it forces a journal transaction to close out,
        stalling the unlink operation.
      * Because of this per-transaction limit, truncate needs to zero
        the [dt]indirect blocks starting from the end of the file, in
        case it needs to start a new transaction in the middle of the
        truncate (ext3 guarantees that a partially-completed truncate
        will be consistent/completed after a crash).
      * The read/write of the file's [dt]indirect blocks from the end of
        the file to the beginning can take a lot of time, as it does
        this in single-block chunks and the blocks are not contiguous.
