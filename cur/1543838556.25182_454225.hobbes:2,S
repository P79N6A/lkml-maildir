True, but not all users of the slab caches are similar lifetime objects. e.g.
bufferheads, dentries, inodes, filps, radix tree nodes, etc all have effectively
random lifetimes. i'd say that most linux slab objects don't have that
property....

*nod*
Just look at how badly the inode and dentry slabs can fragment....

Yes, but you don't tend to get the same worst case behaviour
that you get with single use slabs. With multiple use slabs, long
lifetime objects tend to accumulate on the same pages as different
objects come and go from the pages. IOWs, you waste less pages
in a fragmented multi-object cache that you do in N fragmented
single use caches.

I've never seen the kmalloc slabs show anywhere near the levels of
fragmentation I've seen from the inode and dentry slabs.....
Cheers,
