The next time I can get my machine into that state, sure, I'll try it.
I used to be able to reproduce it using normal laptop usage patterns
(Lotus notes running under wine, kernel builds, apt-get upgrade's,
openoffice, firefox, etc.)  about twice a week with 2.6.13-rc5, but
with 2.6.13, it happened once or twice, but since then I haven't been
able to trigger it.  (Predictably, not after I posted about it on
LKML.  :-/)
I've been trying a few things in the hopes of deliberately triggering
it, but so far, no luck.  Maybe I should go back to 2.6.13-rc5 and see
if I have an easier time of reproducing the failure case.
