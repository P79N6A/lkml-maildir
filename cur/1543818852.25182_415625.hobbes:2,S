It would do the trick for airport cards in G5s.. a little bit of OF
walking to find the card.
It won't help with cardbus broadcom's but then, there is currently no G5
with a cardbus adaptor that I know of :) It's possible I suppose to get
a pci<->cardbus adapter but I suppose in that case, we can ignore it ...
