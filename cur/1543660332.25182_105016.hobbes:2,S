Hi All,
The new common definition of RODATA for linker scripts
(in include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h) is causing me some
amount of pain, at least on the m68knommu architecture.
The problem is that on the m68knommu arch linker script
it fundamentaly groups everything into 2 memory regions,
one for flash and one for ram. Each section is then
directed to the appropriate memory region, eg:
         .text : {
             *(.text)
         } > flash
With the way the RODATA define is setup I cannot do this.
It contains definitions for a number of complete sections.
Anyone got any ideas on the best way to fix this?
Regards
Greg
