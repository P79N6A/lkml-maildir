It's this change, I know it is, because Linus sees the same problem
on his workstation.
You wouldn't happen to be seeing this problem on a PPC box would
you?  Since Linus's machine is a PPC machine too, that would support
my theory that this could be a compiler issue on that platform.
Damn, wait, Patrick, I think I know what's happening.  The iptables
IPT_* verdicts are dependant upon the NF_* values, and they don't
cope with Bart's changes I bet.  Can you figure out what the exact
error would be?  This kind of issue would explain the looping inside
of ipt_do_table(), wouldn't it?
