Subject: [PATCH 0/1] 2.6.17-rc5 patch for HPET operation on NVIDIA platforms
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/1/132

This patch fixes a kernel panic during boot that occurs on NVIDIA
platforms that have
HPET enabled. When HPET is enabled, the standard timer IRQ is routed to
IOAPIC pin 2
and is advertised as such in the ACPI APIC table - but an earlier
workaround in the
kernel was ignoring this override. The fix is to honor timer IRQ
overrides from ACPI
when HPET is detected on an NVIDIA platform.
64-bit kernel patch:
