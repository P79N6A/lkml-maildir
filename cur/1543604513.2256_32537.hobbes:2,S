Absolutely.  module.h detects how the code is being compiled and most
of the macros become noops.  In 2.5 MODULE_PARM will have meaning even
for code built into the kernel, so we get a consistent method of
setting parameters without adding boot line parsing code to every
object.
Always include module.h, never condition MODULE_xxx on CONFIG_MODULES,
init and exit functions should be defined as __init and __exit and
referenced via module_init() and module_exit().  init.h and module.h
will do whatever is necessary, depending on how the code is compiled.
