Thanks very much; this is really helpful.
I looked at 56 of these oops messages in try_to_free_buffers, from 10
machines.  50 messages (4 machines) have %eax=80000000, and 6 messages
(6 machines) have %eax=40000000.  Is this consistent with the single-bit
memory error, or not?  If it's purely a hardware problem, should I be
seeing 20000000 and 10000000 and other one-bit patterns?  And should I
be seeing one-bit differences from valid nonzero pointers?  Or is it the
case that only memory errors in the top two bits will trigger this oops,
and other memory errors might remain undetected, and that the great
majority of entries will be zero so that all of the errors are likely to
occur on those pages?
