tiobench.pl --size 2048 --numruns 3 --threads 128  # 384 MB ram in machine
The ssh session running vmstat no longer updates.  Console won't
give a new "login" prompt with <Enter>.  <sysrq T> prints a 
trace (which I haven't captured - it's really long with > 128 processes).
Does <sysrq T> need any post processing to convert addresses to
something more useful?  I'll save it on 2.5.22 if it happens.
