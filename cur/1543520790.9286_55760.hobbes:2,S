Hi,
An Oops we're getting doesn't save anything to the files, but a
quick scribble from the screen shows these areas in the `Call' list:
memcpy_toiovec
kfree_skbmem
__kfree_skb
skb_free_datagram
packet_recvmsg
sock_recvmsg
sys_recvfrom
...
This happens within seconds of me starting a tcpdump on my ippp0
ISDN interface (HiSax driver for Teles 16.3 card), as I watch for
packets on port 1180 which I'm trying to divert with ipnatctl to a
local Windows machine.
If this isn't enough to be getting on with, I'll gladly force the
crash again and try for a more detailed Oops readout on the serial
console.
Other than that, 2.3.36-pre1 hasn't gone belly-up yet for me.
Thanks for reading this,
John Hayward-Warburton
