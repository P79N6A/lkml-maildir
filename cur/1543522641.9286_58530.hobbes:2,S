Not really, telephony devices come with now up to 240 ports while
winmodems come with 1.
You put E1/T1 circuits (or sometimes many analogue lines) into these
telephony devices, but put 1 analogue line into a winmodem.  This means a
PC can only take x ports with a winmodem (x being number of card slots).
