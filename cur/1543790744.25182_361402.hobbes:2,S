OK, but I was just adding a fix that was closest to what was already
there.  I can play around with other fixes, and try that out too. The
change I made was just like the current method, but it allowed for all
files to be copied instead of just the non-dot ones.
Also, have you looked at the addition to the version_info for alternate
urls.  I think that this can even be added to do multiple urls, as well
as testing for different filenames in all urls first. ie. .bz2 or .gz,
etc.
