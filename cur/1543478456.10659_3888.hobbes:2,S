I've seen similar posts to this one, but no good responses.
Since going from 2.0.36 to 2.2.0pre6 (to get parport features), when my
rc.local sets up my fourth serial port for the attached text terminal:
/bin/setserial -v /dev/ttyS3 irq 11
I get the famous "device or resource busy" message.  Worse, if my PPP
connection dies, it cannot restart because attempts to get at /dev/modem
(/dev/ttyS1) suddenly receive the same message.
So far all I can do to free up the modem port is to restart.  When I do,
prior to the shutdown, /dev/modem somehow becomes available again and
the modem begins dialing.  I'd like to figure out what process is being
killed that suddenly makes the modem available.  Better, I'd like to
figure out what it is about this kernel that is making it so hard to 
configure and use my serial ports.
