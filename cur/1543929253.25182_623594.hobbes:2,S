"pretty bad" as in "a few people see warnings in their dmesg" ?
And TASK_KILLABLE is hopefully about to get merged anyway.
We really need to get better diagnostics for the
bad-kernel-behavior-that-is-seen-as-bug cases. If we ever want to get
to the scenario where we have a more or less robust measure of kernel
quality (and we're not all that far off for several cases), one thing
we need keep doing is have the kernel detect bad cases as much as
possible. This patch is a step in the right direction there, by quite a
lot.
I really don't understand what your objection is to this patch... is it
that an enterprise distro can't ship with it on? (Which is fine btw)
