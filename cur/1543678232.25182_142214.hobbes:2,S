Version 0.4 of the libivykis event handling library is available.
libivykis is a thin wrapper over various OS'es implementation of
I/O readiness notification facilities (such as poll(2), kqueue(2))
and is mainly intended for writing portable high-performance network
servers.
The main change in this release is the addition of infrastructure for
proper support for level-triggered poll methods, and implementations
for /dev/poll (Solaris), poll(2), select(2), kqueue(2) in level-triggered
mode, and sys_epoll in level-triggered mode.  libivykis now supports
both edge-triggered and level-triggered poll methods.
The list of supported poll methods is now:
- /dev/epoll (linux)
- /dev/poll (Solaris)
- kqueue (*BSD)
- kqueue level-triggered (*BSD)
- poll(2)
- realtime signals (linux)
- select(2)
- sys_epoll (linux)
- sys_epoll level-triggered (linux)
