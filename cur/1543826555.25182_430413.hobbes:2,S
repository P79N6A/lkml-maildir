Ok, if someone really wants to have this patch in mainline.
Signed-off-by: Michael Buesch <mb@bu3sch.de>
But the whole purpose of this patch is really questionable.
* This code is only compiled for the OpenWRT Router kernel.
  This kernel does not use softmac, but dscape stack.
  So nobody will ever actually use this code.
  One could even argue, if the code should be removed from
  the softmac driver, but I think openwrt people use it for
  some kind of hacking, testing, whatever.
  It's not so much code, so I don't care. It does not add
  maintainance work.
* Do we really need to increment some reference counters?
  I mean, we are asking for a bus here. This bus is not
  hotpluggable or something and will never go away. Either it
  is soldered on the board or not. That is what we test here.
So, Jiri, if you really want to have this patch upstream, you
have my Signed-off-by. If nobody else cares, it will get lost
in the deep black netdev hole. ;)
