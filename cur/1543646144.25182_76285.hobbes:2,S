1.  CONFIG_LBD is defined only for IA32 and PPC32.
2.  The exports are temporary until other stuff in the RAID code is
cleaned up.
3.  They're only used by the RAID code, and would be the same for all
architectures that use gcc, assuming that CONFIG_LBD were to be turned
on for those architectures.

I'd rather remove them entirely, and am working on that.  In the
meantime, they'll stay (probably until Neil Brown gets back from
holiday next week and can help with my RAID problems)
