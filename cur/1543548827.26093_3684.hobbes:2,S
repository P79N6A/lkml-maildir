	You still have a window when i_blocks is out of sync with 
dquot. If your nice, non-blocking, etc. switch happens in that window - we
are toast, right? It means that we can't change i_blocks before dquot -
currently dquot_{alloc,free}_block() can block. Now, consider the
following:
				dquot_transfer()
					....
					switched
					dqput()	****BLOCKED
dquot_alloc_block()
	dqduplicate()
	dquot_lock() **** BLOCKED
					dquot_unlock()
					dqput()
					....
				finished
	....
	updated the thing *** WINDOW OPENED
	dquot_unlock()
	dqput() **** BLOCKED
				another dquot_transfer()
					....
					switched
					....
				finished
finished
updated i_blocks *** WINDOW CLOSED
The second switch happens in the window. QED.
