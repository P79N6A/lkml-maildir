i agree.  but a number of people have already suggested that that
lower-level menu
  "Configure standard kernel features (for small systems)" --->
is not well-designed.  and the very people you're talking about will
see that and not be quite sure what it represents.  and they
*certainly* won't realize that *not* selecting it will have
consequences in other menus.
that particular menu is confusing for a number of reasons:
1) it's badly named
2) it has no help to explain it
3) even if you don't select it, it will still have some sub-menu
entries, which is non-intuitive
4) it's not at all clear that, if you don't select it, other possible
config entries all over the source tree won't be available.

i'm betting even embedded people might not understand what's going on
there.  it's particularly confusing since, if you choose that option,
you will suddenly see a number of additional "small system" features
you can turn off, but there's no indication that options all over the
tree are suddenly becoming visible.
note:  i have no problem with some kind of overall, top-level option
that does this sort of thing.  i just don't think the current
technique is the right way.  in fact, i think it's awful, and i'd love
to see it made more obvious.
