Well, you explain where the f*** module "cfi" is located.  It took me a
few hours to figure out what module is, in fact, "cfi".

The question becomes, what section of the rom should not be erased?  If I
erase the entire 128k and then reset the system before getting a good image
back in there, I'm betting it'll disappear from the bus.  It's already
screwed up to the point it no longer shows up in PCI space as itself -- which
was entertaining to see the bad BIOS post and then not find itself :-)

I'm sure the HPT users of the world will love me if I manage to flash the
SOB from linux.
