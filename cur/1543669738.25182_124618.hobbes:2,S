Um, I thought he is our device numbering czar and names are still picked 
by the driver authors?
Further this mail http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=101540151714636&w=2
only mentions Alan and Marcelo, will these device numbers be valid for 
2.6? Has Linus changed his mind in the meantime?
