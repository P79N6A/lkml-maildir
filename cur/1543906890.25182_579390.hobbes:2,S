ok, i misunderstood your "very few realise its more than a fraction of a 
percent" sentence, i thought you were saying it's a fraction of a 
percent.
Measurements show that noatime helps 20-30% on regular desktop 
workloads, easily 50% for kernel builds and much more than that (in 
excess of 100%) for file-read-intense workloads. We cannot just walk 
past such a _huge_ performance impact so easily without even reacting to 
the performance arguments, and i'm happy Ubuntu picked up 
noatime,nodiratime and is whipping up the floor with Fedora on the 
desktop.
just look at the spontaneous feedback this thread prompted:

much of the hard performance work we put into the kernel and into 
userspace is basically masked by the atime stupidity. How many man-years 
did it take to implement prelink? It has less of an impact than noatime! 
How much effort did we put into smart readahead and bootup 
optimizations? It has less of an impact than noatime.
