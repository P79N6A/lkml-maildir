  Then your telnetd needs 'fixing'.  This works fine, with /dev/pts on
my Debian stable/Woody system:
20:56:57 0$ w athan
USER     TTY      FROM              LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU  WHAT
athan    pts/26   XXXXXXXXXXXXXX   20:56    1:04   0.09s  0.09s  -bash
That's a telnet login just started.
  This is specifically using the 'telnetd-ssl' package in Debian.
