Greetings,
After running just fine for most of the day, my PIII/500 coughed up 
attached fur-ball as I tried to start my ancient (au) sound 
server.  Subsequent repeated starting and stopping of same did not induce a 
repeat (but then all zillion sound modules were loaded).  If any other info 
is needed, just holler.
