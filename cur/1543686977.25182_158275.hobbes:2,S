 IIRC, OSF/1 running on later Alphas with a PS/2 keyboard interface
(earlier oned had an LK201 one) uses mode #3.  I can't comment on the VMS.

 Since the 8042+keyboard combo supports a PC/XT compatibility mode there
was no incentive -- why bother modifying software if the hardware works
with the old one?  Even if that sucks.

 For mode #3 explicit handling for hot-plugging would be required -- I
guess the change would be much too intrusive.  And untranslated mode #2 is
nearly the same as an emulated PC/XT keyboard: codes are different and the
release bit is replaced by the release code, but the multibyte mess for
PS/2-specific keys remains -- no gain at all.
