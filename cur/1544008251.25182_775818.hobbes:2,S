Or maybe a generic lro_check_header() that can be called from
everybody's get_frag_header()/get_skb_header().  I guess what
bothers me is the division of checks between the get_*_header()
routine and lro_tcp_ip_checks() and the inevitable code
duplication in the get_*_header routines.
I still don't understand why an unneeded check for fragmentation
in case (3) is any more objectionable than the existing tcp
flags checks in lro_tcp_ip_check(), many of which are surely
not needed in case (3) either.
