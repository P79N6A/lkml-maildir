The class - objects are used just for display use.. your patch should
apply (sans offsets) without problems.. I don't think that the two
different algorithms would be displayed in sysfs as i use the cra_name
as directory name (which should be aes for aes and aes-i586).

good one.
If there are lots of different implementation for a given algorithm it
could be worthwhile to create a algorithm and a implementation -
directory e.g.
ls /sysfs/class/crypto/implementations would list:
aes-i586 aes-c4 md5 sha1 sha256-c4
and: ls /sysfs/class/crypto/algorithms
aes
with ls /sysfs/class/crypto/algorithms/aes
name type implementations
where implementations is a directory with links to the given
implementations in /sysfs/class/crypto/implementations.
Seems like a lot of work if there are only few implementations (like aes
and aes-i586).
the same could be done without the implementations - directory. If a new
algorithm tries to register itself with a already registered name (and
the module name isn't known) it is added to the
/sysfs/class/crypto/<cra-name>/implementations - directory as
<module-name>. All Algorithm - specific data would be displayed in the
<cra-name> directory, the rest in the implementations/<module-name> -
directory.
I'm moving to vienna the day after tomorrow so don't expect too fast
response times from me.
