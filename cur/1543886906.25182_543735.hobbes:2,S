hm, yeah.
We could put a cpumask in percpu_counter, initialise it to
cpu_possible_map.  Then, those callsites which have hotplug notifiers can
call into new percpu_counter functions which clear and set bits in that
cpumask and which drain percpu_counter.counts[cpu] into
percpu_counter.count.
And percpu_counter_sum() gets taught to do for_each_cpu_mask(fbc->cpumask).
