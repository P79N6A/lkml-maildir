If we really want it disambiguated then we should call it something 
like 'bitwise-negated' or 'ones-complemented'. 'Complemented' alone is 
worse than 'negated' imo, since negation is at least the usual name for 
the tilde operator in C while complementation is an ambiguous term 
unless you know the base/radix.
