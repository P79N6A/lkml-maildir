	Yes, it's the common problem with all kernel-mode faults. The
problem being: you don't know *who* had set the lock/spinlock/semaphore,
increased the usage counter, etc. and which resources were held by dying
process. Any attempt to store this information (i.e. do equivalent of
destructors) will have a nasty side-effect - we'll slow down a lot of
stuff on nearly every time-critical path ;-/ So the current behaviour is 
least of two evils - after all, it doesn't punish correct code.
