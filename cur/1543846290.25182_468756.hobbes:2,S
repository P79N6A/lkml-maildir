I think it's still slightly defective, or at least suffering from a
disjoint between what is going on - the numbers reported in /proc/stats
add up to the total number of timer interrupts, but that's not necessarily
representative of what happened...

And the deltas between the sums for cpu0 are equal to the difference of
the first intr (where the timer is) - ticking along at about 446/sec over
that 15 second timeframe. And sure enough, the 'user' field is about 1/3 of
the total interrupts.
The breakage is that userspace tools like gkrellm and vmstat and top are quite
happy in saying "oh, we averaged 446 ticks/sec over the last N seconds? That's
odd, but I can deal..." but unfortunately, treating all of them the same
"width" - and the idle ones are probably twice as wide if not wider.  I'm not
sure how to fix that.
(The "thought experiment" for this - imagine over a 10 second period, an idle
machine takes 100 short timeslices for a running process, and 100 very long
sleeps 10 times as long as the first 100.  What should /proc/stats report at
that point?)
