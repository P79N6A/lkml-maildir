Yes, what you describe (or my reading of it :) would simplify the
implementation, and solve the capability problem.
So in general, when you mount something, the mount is owned by you.
To mount something as you, either the mountpoint's mount is owned by
you, or you have some capability, maybe CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
So, before any non-root user can do a mount, root must mount an ancestor
mount in the name of that user.  This would be a new mount flag, so
	mount -o user=some_user /share/$USER/home/$USER /share/$USER/home/$USER
as root.  Mount does not change the fsuid, it simply passes the user=
flag into do_loopback(), which sets the mnt->user flag.  And now, even
though i have /share as chmod 000, root didn't have to setfsuid so we
have the necessary caps.
(clearly, -o user requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN or something)
