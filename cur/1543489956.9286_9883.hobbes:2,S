If the tsc goes as hell gettimeofday will die too, and the TSC is
explicity declared from Intel as a really safely trustable thing, so if
the TSC will die I expect many other part of the CPU to die too.

And maybe somebody may really intentionally take the cpu clied for more
than 10msec for some strange usage.

Since we'll printk a message anyway and so we have just increased the
complexity of the code anyway, so why not to also recover the lost tick in
a slow path as I do?

I am not fixing the symptom, I am recovering the bug at runtime kprinting
the useful information as in your patch but with the difference that then
I am allowing the machine to run fine until the problem will get fixed
(and to get it fixed you may need to wait some time like in the scsi
code).
