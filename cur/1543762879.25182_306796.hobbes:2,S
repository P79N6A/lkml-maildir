It is not the case that *all* the cachelines of a page are going to be
used right after zeroing. For the page fault case it is only guaranteed that
*one* cacheline will be used. In the PTE/PMD/PUD page allocation cases it
is likely that only a single cacheline is used.
There are some cases in the code (apart from the fault handler)
where zeroed pages are allocated with no guarantee of use (f.e. the
allocations for buffers for shared memory or pipes).

If the time is short then hot cleaning is the right way to go and then
prezeroing is of no benefit. Prezeroing can only be of benefit if there is
sufficient time between the zeroing and the use of the data. It must be
sufficiently long to cause the the cachelines to no longer be in
in the caches. Then the loading of these cachelines may be avoided which
yields the performance benefit.
