CFQ passes the req's on directly until there is enough load... In the
load case it builds queues. Just like SFQ (but sfq can drop packets
afair).
This way, we wouldn't have the initial
'can-we-merge-this-with-other-data-coming' delay when not needed.
If as could be attached to the 'queue build up' then AS would only be
doing what it's good at, throughput and minimizing head movements.
Also patches that move prioritized data (data for processes with high
pri) would fit right in there since you'd only be doing it during actual
load.
(note: load as in disk load)
