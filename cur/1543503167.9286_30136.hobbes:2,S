This sounds like a Good Idea(tm). 
It's also a lot more straightforward as a concept than is the notion of
CLONE_PID, which never got really implemented because it has a ton of
subtle issues (I think that CLONE_PID will basically always just remain
useful for the initial kernel threads, and what pthreads needs in
addition to the CLONE_SIBLING flag is a CLONE_SIGNALS thing).
