_Exactly_ ;).

I think some real-world swap-performance can give us some number about
this issue. I believe there will be no need to further change kswapd in
real-world since with 4giga of ram the swap performances won't be
critical. It's true that a swap_out() may stall for some long time if
there is a big chunk of bigmem allocated in the user-MM though. But again
I don't consider this a major problem.
If it would been safe I would just do something like:
	do_try_to_free_pages(GFP_KSWAPD | (nr_bigmem_pages ? 0 : GFP_BIGMEM));
but it's not safe because you _can't_ know for sure what the system really
needs (the bigmem pages may be all allocated in userspace and you may want
regular pages and not bigmem pages).
And in general taking lots of regular pages free is a good thing. We won't
have VM pressure if there aren't bigmem pages free.

Yes. I think the more interesting issue is swap_out that may run for some
long time without go to sleep (I think exactly what just happens with
GFP_DMA).

Yes, that was exactly my point ;).
