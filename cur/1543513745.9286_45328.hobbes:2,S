FWIW, 2.2.23-pre5 locks on mine shortly after the fsck...
On the first occasion it was in apmd, but turning that off did not help.
This isn't the same computer that needs mem=63M for 2.3.22, but I'm
going to try mem=something on this one later in case that makes it
work.  I didn't spot any great looking fix for the e820 problem in pre5.
