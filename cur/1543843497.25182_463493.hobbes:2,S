Ok,
here are more informations, and i believe now this is not a software problem 
of any kind...
3 things i remarked : 
1/ when changing cables, i still had problems with ata1 : for me, this would 
sound like the controller "ata1" has maybe issues, as ata2 worked before...
2/ when swapping cables, I had problems with ata2 too : this would mean the 
cable had also some issues...
3/ maybe, (but i'm not sure...) the drive needs its own power cable : I mean, 
when the power cable , which contains a "sata plug" and a "ide plug" is 
connected to sata alone, it seems to work better than when the cable is 
connected to both a ide and a sata drive , or the graphic card and the sata 
drive....
since I got a 430 W True Power PSU from Antec, i don't really believe the 
problem is a power problem, but maybe it was too much on one cable??
I'll stop at it, since it seems to work fine, with a config like "1drive -  
ata2 - own power cable". If I go into more troubles, i will try more tests 
and if I arrive to any kind of conclusion, i will let you know about it!
thanks again for the help,
Philippe
