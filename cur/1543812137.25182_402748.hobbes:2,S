e.g. consider a simple RAID-1. It will always map the requests twice so the 
normal case is 2 times as much IOMMU space needed. Or even more with bigger 
raids.
But you're right of course that only waiting for one user would be likely
sufficient. e.g. even if it misses some freeing events the "current" device
should eventually free some space too.
On the other hand it would seem cleaner to me to solve it globally
instead of trying to hack around it in the higher layers.

__wake_up takes the spinlock even when nobody waits.
