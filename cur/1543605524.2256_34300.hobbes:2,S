No the CPU is not important (at this stage anyway).
Tell us:  kernel version, glibc version, compiler version, stdlibc++ version.
And send the code too. (If you can't or won't, or if the code is lenghty, write
up a small program to reproduce the error and send the code for that one
instead).
It's probably a stdlibc++ bug.  If it's a glibc bug or a kernel bug, the same
error can be reproduced in C too - can it ?
