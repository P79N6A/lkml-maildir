Supporting portable binary modules adds a lot of work, and slows down
your driver.  If you strongly believe in your case:  show us the code.
I am confident that a solution to support binary loadable modules will
be accepted by Linus and Alan -- if it does not add overhead to the
kernel.
Further, I don't think you'll get very far arguing against open source
device drivers.  
You imply it is bad that the current nature of the kernel practically
forces vendors to open source their drivers.  Most of us believe just
the opposite... open sourcing the driver means that you can fix problems
that the vendor can't or won't take care of in a reasonable amount of
time.  It means a volunteer can update the driver for a new kernel
version, without having to wait for the vendor.
There are so many reasons why we should strongly encourage open source
drivers.
