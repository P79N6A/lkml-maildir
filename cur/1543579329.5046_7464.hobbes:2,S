Hello!
> It's about direct i/o from/to pages,
Yes. Formally, there are no problems to send to tcp directly from io space.
But could someone explain me one thing. Does bus-mastering
from io really work? And if it does, is it enough fast?
At least, looking at my book on pci, I do not understand
how such transfers are able to use bursts. MRM is banned for them...
