Ok, thanks for the OMAP stuff.  I think I can understand now.
Why not have GPIO numbers refer to unique combinations of GPIO+pin?  If 
the GPIO line is tied to a piece of external hardware, that connection 
is surely through a specific pin.  So it seems like you'd need GPIO+pin 
every time there was an option.

Yikes!  :)
Explain to me why having GPIO enumerations map to unique GPIO+pin 
combinations would be a bad idea in this case?  It seems like the point 
here is to help a driver find and assert their GPIO _pin_ so that the 
driver can can talk to the attached external hardware.  Having an 
enumeration "GPIO62M7" would be a handy way to do that.  Maybe the 
enumeration is actually defined as ((0x400 << 16) | (14 << 8) | 4), or 
some other encoding that makes it easy in the implementation of 
gpio_XXX() to find the right registers and get the routing set up 
correctly.  It's just an opaque, magic number to the driver after all.
And since GPIOs are arch/mach/board-specific anyway, who would care if 
OMAP was the only system that had an enumeration called "GPIO62M7"?  
When other boards set up their platform_struct, they'd use the 
enumerations available for that platform.  "GPIOA1" in systems where 
that GPIO line could only go to one pin per the datasheet, for example.
