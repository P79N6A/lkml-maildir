netdev could be better mailing list for this kind of issue. Anyway, it
looks like something managed to set the last packet number to very high
number which will make all future frames dropped as replays.

Are you using wpa_supplicant to take care of the WPA2 handshake? If yes,
it would be interesting to see debug log from it for the key handshake
that happened just prior to this replay issue occurring.

This is not normal behavior, i.e., something is indeed broken
(driver/supplicant/AP). Though, the those messages could be disabled by
default if there were a useful counter for detecting this kind of issues
easily. Anyway, these debug messages are quite useful in figuring out
what could have caused the "replays".
