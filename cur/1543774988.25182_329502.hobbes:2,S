The only thing that is blocked by having no swap is swapping. The only
things that go to swap are things that can't go anywhere else (because
swap is comparatievly slow). As far as I know, the only things that land
in swap are modified private writable file-backed mappings
(e.g. relocations in text sections of programs), and allocated anonymous
mappings (what most people think of as `data'). (Data allocated via
brk() is of the latter type.)
So if swap is turned off, the kernel can still acquire more memory when
short by discarding file-backed pages from the page cache --- this
includes non-modified text pages of programs and modified non-private
file mappings, as well as data read/written via read() and write().
That is, with no swapfile, the kernel can't swap. It can still *page*,
pushing stuff out to files if modified, throwing them out of memory if
not, and reloading them from their original file when needed.

Yeah, it's a 2.6 thing.
