I've not investigated this yet, but it would be really nice if you
could build up traffic shaping rules in teh same way as the ipchains
rules. e.g. I would like to be able to restrict certain IPs on my
network to a certain amount of bandwidth.
Beyond that I would like to be able to use dynamic sharing in that if
only 1 person is doing stuff that goes outside the LAN they will get
full bandwidth, but as more people join in the bandwidth will be
shared out equally. This would prevent the problem where one person
sets a huge download going and no-one else can get decent response
times anywhere.
