That's stretching it quite a bit.  So you are saying that the owner is
the first swapper task, from the booting CPU?  Well, you better have
that same process unlock that mutex, since a mutex has a owner and the
owner _must_ be the one to unlock it.  And in lots of these cases, it's
some other thread that releases the lock.
With mutexs, the owner is not a state, but a task.
