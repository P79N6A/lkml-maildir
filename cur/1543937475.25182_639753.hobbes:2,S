If you find yourself wanting to perform computations like finding
maxima, or responding right there as opposed to later during userspace
trace data extraction, then you're trending toward a tool like
systemtap.

Yes, more self-contained marker events are necessary for meaningful
in-situ processing.  That needs to be balanced by the increased cost
for computing and passing the extra parameters, multiplied the event
occurrence rate.
In this case, the prev/next pointers are sufficient to compute the
other values.  For particularly performance-critical markers, it may
not be unreasonable to expect the callback functions to dereference
such pointers for pretty-printing or other processing.

This \0 hack is perhaps too clever.  Much of the cost of the extra
parameters is already paid by the time that a simpleminded tracing
callback function starts going through the string.  Also, I believe
the systemtap marker interface would break if the format strings were
not singly terminated ordinary strings.
