It is also impossible for me to go this way because there is no way
to put 20+ events between 226 and 240...

That's what I thought too. However, it seems to work only when the
keysym associated with the modifier is a well known key (Control_L,
Control_R, Alt_L etc).
If I do (214 is the keycode generated by my Fn key):
	keycode 214 = Control_L
	clear mod3
	add mod3 = Control_L
then Fn + F1 will generate Mod3 + F1 (but Control_L will not work as 
a Control modifier anymore).
But if I do:
	keycode 214 = function
	clear mod3
	add mod3 = function
then (at least) WindowMaker does not see the modifier anymore (only
a 'function' single key press is received).
