A good trick which the help output doesn't mention is that % and $ are
special in input, so you can do:
0:mon> di %pc
disassemble instructions at address pointed to by register PC
Other regs are eg: %lr, %r1, %r12.
And it works with di, d and other commands.
Also:
0:mon> di $.xmon_register_spus
disassemble instructions at address of symbol .xmon_register_spus.
cheers
