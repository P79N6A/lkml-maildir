thanks for the fix, i've queued it up. The breakage was introduced via:
  commit 7d851c8d3db0f79b92c8b14361779ede8acd2488

    x86: add framework to disable CPUID bits on the command line
    There are already various options to disable specific cpuid bits
    on the command line. They all use their own variable. Add a generic
    mask to make this easier in the future.
