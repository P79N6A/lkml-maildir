No you are not correct, must be caused by something else. Just building
CFQ into the kernel doesn't enable it, you need to boot with
elevator=cfq for that to happen. So whether CONFIG_IOSCHED_CFQ is set or
not cannot make a difference by itself.
The performance difference must be caused by some other change between
test8-mm1 and -test9.
