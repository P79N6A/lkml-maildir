It isn't being intelligent, its being dumb. I've not seen a smart
PCMCIA<->CF convertor. USB ones yes but not PCMCIA.

Don't think so - and just tested - we don't. Its totally [select an
expletive]ed if I do that. the /proc/ide identify data and the dumped
ident data directly from ide are different.

We generate hot plug events when scanning the partition tables each
time. So you'd get the same loops - or am I misunderstanding something
here about what you mean by "correctly" ?
So in fact its not a case of ->removable but that IDE wants to seperate
->removable and ->mightgoaway. That lets us fix the broken cache flush
behaviour with modern media monitoring tools.
ie change idedisk_release to do
    if(drive->mightgoaway||drive->usage==1) ide_cacheflush_p(drive)
then
    if(drive->doorlocking && drive->usage == 1)
Syquests (real removable IDE disk) will have drive->doorlocking = 1 set
PCMCIA will have drive->mightgoaway set so will flush
(and M/O disks are ide-scsi or ide-cd so not affected)
The first change is needed because currently several control apps may
hold the disk open for media change detection, SMART and the like and if
they do so the user perceived "close" - end of a raw I/O access or
umount return will not media flush.
