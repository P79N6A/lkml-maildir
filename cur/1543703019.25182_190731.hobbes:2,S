I have tested 2.6.x on 3 systems.  Only one of those exibit this problem. 
The system is a dual pIII 1ghz with 1024mb ram (kernel configured for 4gb
support).  The board is a supermicro p3tdde.  the other 2 systems are hp
compaq d220 pc and an MSI MS6163.  I am using the builtin ports on all
systems.
The p3dde works flawlessly with 2.4.23.
The one thing I see is the fact that the p3tdde uses a via chipset instead
of intel like the other 2 (and has more memory and 2 cpus)
