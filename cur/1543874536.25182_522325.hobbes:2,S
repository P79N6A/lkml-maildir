Just a note for readers of lkml:  git-ieee1394.patch is steadily growing
thanks to Kristian Høgsberg's work on his new alternative FireWire
drivers.  Recently Kristian posted preliminary patches to the popular
low-level FireWire libraries libraw1394 and libdc1394, making them
interoperable with his newly designed kernel--userspace ABI.  (Mainline
Linux' IEEE 1394 subsystem features a slightly unfortunate variety of
userspace ABIs, some of them abstracted by the mentioned libraries, some
directly used.)  I heard Kristian also already worked on integration
with HAL, i.e. there are now more and more pieces of the puzzle coming
together.
