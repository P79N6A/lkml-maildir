Eh?  Yes it is.  Try again, this time remembering the elementary logic
that I'm sure you're good at! You are forgetting the zero case. Both
"I don't care where you live [and therefore I don't have any opinion
on the matter]" and "I think you live in greece" are covered by "I
will send postcards to where I think you live", not by "I will send
postcards to where you really live". That was the distinction I was
making.

Both of those are (2). I.e. the specified trigger is that the  code thinks
the condition is true. It just so happens that under the "I won't look"
policy, the code will never think the condition is true. But both
situations are covered by the "thinks it's true" description. That's
all I was saying.

Block the return until there are no relinkings underway.

Yes. What happens if one renames elements of the path under the feet of
a process in unix, btw? I asssume the process ends up with an invalid cwd
and starts having a lot of trouble going anywhere.

True. There is clearly an information leak caused by the linux
path cacheing mechanism there. But the process has no way of knowing if
its information is still current.
I almost feel that a process should die if it loses the right to be
where it is, through renaming or re-perming of components of the 
path to its current directory.

It probably should never have known (the absolute path to) its directory.
It was none of its business.
I suspect that removing the whole idea of absolute paths would solve the
chroot problem and others once and for all.  You should only be able to
see daughter directories, and you should indeed (as in classical unix)
be forced to beg for information about your ancestry.
That would require every user home to have symlinks to /usr and /bin
and /lib :-).
