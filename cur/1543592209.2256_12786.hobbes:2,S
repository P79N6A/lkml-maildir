All drives with voice coils for head movement do auto park on power off
by design. Only really old drives with stepper motors (Seagate ST225
and friends, over 15 years old) don't do it, but the capacity of those
drives don't make it worthwile supporting anyway.

It's so easy that it should be done from the init scripts instead of
from kernel. "hdparm -Y device" forces the drive to sleep mode.

That's a silly argument. Why should the OS leave the system clean? It's
the boot code's task to set up the system in a proper way.
