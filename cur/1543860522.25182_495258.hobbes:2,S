RAID-0 swap is not the thing to run if reliability is a must, clearly. 
Interestingly, after a long fight with poor RAID-5 write speed, I moved 
my swap to RAID-10, only to find that recovery disks don't know how to 
use it. Tried Fedora and then a live CD (puppy, I think).
Detail on the RAID-5 performance thing in the linux-raid archives, won't 
rehash here.
