We want to rewrite more things than only pcmcia. Current modules
system has problem: if driver is in kernel, one driver handles two
devices. HOWEVER if driver is module, two drivers are required for two
devices.
This seems ugly.
Many laptops with pcmcia are out there, and hot pluggable pci has
became reality. Current kernel does not support hot-plugging.
This has to change.
Parameter passing is very different in modular / nonmodular versions.
This should be unified.
So maybe it is time for major changes around devices. Than changes
should bring hotplugging into normal kernel. And it seems to me like
rather good time for bringing PCMCIA support in. I would really like
to boot up monolitic kernel on my laptop and _still_ use pcmcia ne2k.
