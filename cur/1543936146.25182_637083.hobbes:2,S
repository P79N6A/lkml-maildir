END() is fine too since it contains .size too:
#ifndef END
#define END(name) \
  .size name, .-name
#endif

I don't think these change makes sense given the definition of END()
shown above.
The only change that would make sense is adding END() (or ENDPROC()) 
to a function that doesn't have either of them yet.
Since you seem to do nop changes something is wrong with your
testing procedure?
