Well, unfortunately TICK_NSEC just gives the *current* tick length as
requested by ntpd. So it won't work over an long interval of jiffies
where TICK_NSEC might have changed.

Indeed you are correct. Since timer interrupts are not precisely or
accurately delivered, a timer interrupt counter (jiffies), cannot be
used as a reliable time source (except where there is not other time
source). The problem is that it is difficult to discern where jiffies is
just being used as a timer subsystem counter, or where its being used as
a time of day time source.
Even worse, this is a userspace visible usage of jiffies as a time
stamp, so in this case we have to preserve the interface and find a way
to emulate it. So proc_pid_stats() may need to do the reverse of what
procps is doing.

Yep, I've been working like crazy on just this (well, when my work isn't
swamping me). Unfortunately it is a major overhaul and causes cascading
changes (removal of xtime), so its not going as quickly as I'd like.
However I feel the design is quite good and I will attach a copy of it
and the first pass of the code in a reply to this email.
thanks
