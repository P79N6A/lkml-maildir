I really think that Evgeniy's kevent is a good event notification
mechanism for anything, including AIO.
Events are events, applications want a centralized way to receive and
process them.
It's already implemented, and if there are tangible problems with it,
Evgeniy has been excellent at responding to criticism and implementing
suggested changes to the interfaces.
