Yes. A number of achitectures use something like
	strlcpy(saved_command_line, cmd_line, sizeof(saved_command_line));
and that "sizeof()" would require the full declaration.
However, I don't see any reason why we couldn't make that sizeof be
COMMAND_LINE_SIZE instead, if somebody is willing to grep and do the
conversion and make sure everybody who now uses it has <asm/setup.h>
included.
Hmm?
