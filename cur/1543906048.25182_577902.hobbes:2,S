The memory area mapping must be changed before time_init, where the
first EFI runtime serivce (efi_get_time) is called. But
"change_page_attr" can not be used there, because "alloc_pages" is used
by "change_page_attr".
Should I change "change_page_attr" to make it work before "mem_init"? Or
Should I change "init_memory_mapping" to make it can be used to change
mapping attributes? Which one is better?

Yes. I just want to remove _NX for some areas.
