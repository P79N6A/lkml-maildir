OK, here is a little more divergence from common practice, but please
don't throw too many stones (at least not large ones).  The following
style was invoked by Linus recently in the first of the zlib
conversions. 
Here is a snippet of a patch from arch/ppc/xmon/ppc-opc.c:
@@ -420,19 +420,19 @@
    same.  */
/*ARGSUSED*/
-static unsigned long
-insert_bba (insn, value, errmsg)
-     unsigned long insn;
-     long value;
-     const char **errmsg;
+static unsigned long insert_bba(
+       unsigned long insn,
+       long value,
+       const char **errmsg
+)
{
   return insn | (((insn >> 16) & 0x1f) << 11);
}
One added bonus of the above style is that it leaves the line count
unchanged. ;)
