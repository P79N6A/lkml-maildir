----- Original message -----
Hi,
just wanted to remark that I never liked that bzip was replaced by bzip2 
(were there license issues?) since bzip's compression was/is often 
stronger:
39843104 Mar 28 09:33 linux-2.6.15.7.tar.bz2
39423739 Mar 28 09:33 linux-2.6.15.7.tar.bz
Not a big difference in this case but still a step back. I for once am 
keeping my bzip binary.. does anyone know where the source can still be 
found?
