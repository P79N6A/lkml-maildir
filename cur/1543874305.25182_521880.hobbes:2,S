IOW, we can (afaics) do
	static struct sighand_struct *signalfd_get_sighand(struct signalfd_ctx *ctx,
							   unsigned long *flags)
	{
		struct sighand_struct *sighand = NULL;
		struct tsak_struct *tsk;
		rcu_read_lock();
		tsk = rcu_dereference(ctx->tsk);  // not needed, just a documentation
		if (tsk != NULL)
			sighand = lock_task_sighand(tsk, flags);
		rcu_read_unlock();
		if (sighand && !ctx->tsk)) {
			unlock_task_sighand(tsk, flags);
			sighand = NULL;
		}
		return sighand;
	}
If signalfd_get_sighand() succeeds, ctx->tsk is pinned.
Oleg.
