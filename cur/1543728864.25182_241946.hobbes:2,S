| Did a quick hack on this.
| When choosing help on "HCI BlueFRITZ! USB driver" menuconfig now displays:
| 
| -------------------------------------------------
| Depends on (select to enable this option):
| BT & USB
| Selects (will be enabled by this option): 
| FW_LOADER
| 
| CONFIG_BT_HCIBFUSB
| 
| Bluetooth HCI BlueFRITZ! USB driver.
| ....
| -------------------------------------------------
| 
| To simplify things I just malloc'ed 'enough' memory for the help screen.
| Just a quick hack, but something to play with - and no lxdialog hacking :-)
Hi Sam,
I started on this yesterday also, but you are ahead of me.
Looking pretty good, but for menu items in the EMBEDDED menu,
it misses entries like this one:
config FUTEX
	bool "Enable futex support" if EMBEDDED
It doesn't list any Depends data, but it actually depends on EMBEDDED.
I'll look at it more later.  Got other stuff to do now.
