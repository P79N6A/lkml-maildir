That's their NetStream 2000 DVD (mpeg/ac3) decoder.
There are reverse engineered (GPL) drivers for the Hollywood Plus.
As a side note, there are currently 4 misc minor numbers allocated to
the em8300 drivers (according to Documentation/devices.txt).  That's
fine for one card but the driver support up to 4 cards so we'd need 16
devices in that case.  Currently we're using major number 121.  Does
anyone have suggestions for moving over to official device numbers?
