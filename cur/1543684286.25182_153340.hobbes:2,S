I hate email sometimes.  My attitude is "some things you really can't
cut out".  I really am all for trying to cut things out, it's just that
some things are tied in rather well (like sysfs and root device as
opposed to the static table before).

Power Management, sysfs plays / will play a role in finding out the order
in which devices get powered down.  This is important on some types of
embedded devices (and arguably important everywhere).
