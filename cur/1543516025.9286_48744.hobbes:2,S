Hi!
Sorry, for reporting these so late, but time...
i) in init/main.c:
   if CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD is set, then the variable 'memory_start' is
   not defined/declared (i think, since 2.3.24 ?); hopefully the last
   INITRD memory_start/end bug...
ii) in fs/hpfs/file.c:
   in 'hpfs_write_partial_page' gcc does not like the entry offset in
   'struct page'...
iii) in drivers/net/net_init.c:
   if CONFIG_TR is set, then 'ARPHRD_IEEE802_TR' is not defined/declared
   (i think, new in 2.3.28); maybe typo: 'ARPHRD_IEEE802' is enough!(?)
