Thanks for doing this work.
But it would make a lot more sense to add
compat_setsockopt and compat_getsockopt socket
operations, call down into there, and then implement
these translations inside of netfilter itself.
This would avoid an enormous amount of copying
and munging, and also would keep netfilter internals
outside of the generic socket compat layer code.
Thanks.
