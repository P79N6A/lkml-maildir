I'll try and get my patch ready for testing soon.  It got sidetracked by 
the compute_creds race (erm... and my inability to fix it right the 
first time).
Before I clean it up and rediff it, here's a question:
I would like to make the inheritable mask mean "these are the only 
capabilities that this process or its children may ever hold."  That 
means tweaking setuid to disable itself if the inheritable mask is not 
full to avoid auditing every setuid program ever written..  The benefit 
is that cap_bset can be removed and securelevel can done sanely (by 
adding a sysctl that means "setuid needs this set of capabilities").  It 
also means that servers could drop inheritable caps, so, if they are 
hacked, the attacker can't try to exploit setpcap / setuid / 
(eventually) vfs caps.  The downside is added complexity.
If I don't do that, I'm not quite sure what to do with the inheritable 
mask.  It seems to be only marginally useful.
Thoughts?
