Wow.  Why?
or did you want this applied only to the 2.6.16.* stable kernel?

--------------------------
Patching file kernel/sched.c using Plan A...
Hunk #1 succeeded at 5032 with fuzz 2 (offset 430 lines).
Hmm...  Ignoring the trailing garbage.
done
<me checks>
I'm surprised that none of Documentation/SubmittingPatches or
The Perfect Patch (
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt
)
or Jeff Garzik's patch-format page (
http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html
)
(AFAICT) mention that patches should be made against "current" or
"recent" or "head of tree" or some such words.
I'll "fix" Doc/SubmittingPatches... and/or Doc/SubmitChecklist.
