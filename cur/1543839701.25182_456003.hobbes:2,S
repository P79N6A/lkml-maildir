first, please notice, that this thread is not about user memory.
we can discuss it later when about to control user memory. And
I still need to notice, that different models of user memory control
can exist. With and without reclamation.

where? in UBC? in UBC _there_ are guarentees, even in regard to OOM killer.

controllers do not modify interfaces nor core. They just add
themself to the list of resources and setup default limits.
do you think it is worth creating infrastructure for these
2 one-line-changes?
