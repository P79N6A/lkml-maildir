We could do it that way.  But don't you think it's more reliable to
save and restore around the event we know will be what clobbers the
PCI config space on us? :-)
Other things might happen between ->resume() and ->open() that could
modify PCI config space, and we could overwrite such changes if we do
the PCI restore in ->open().
One thing that's interesting to me is that, essentially, every PCI
driver with very few if any exceptions needs to do this sequence on
suspend and resume.  It would be nice if there was a way to get this
to happen transparently by default, with some reasonable override
mechanism, for PCI device drivers.
Anyways, once your patch is tested feel free to send me the bnx2
one too.
Thanks!
