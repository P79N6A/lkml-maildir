    Also remember to upgrade your binutils package (for as/ld/nm and company)
    if necessary. For more information, refer to ./Documentation/Changes.

 The recommended compiler for the kernel is gcc 2.95.x (x >= 3), and it

+should be used when you need absolute stability. You may use gcc 3.x
 instead if you wish, although it may cause problems. Later versions of gcc 
 have not received much testing for Linux kernel compilation, and there are 
 almost certainly bugs (mainly, but not exclusively, in the kernel) that
 will need to be fixed in order to use these compilers. In any case, using
 pgcc instead of plain gcc is just asking for trouble.
 
-gcc 2.91.66 (egcs-1.1.2) continues to be supported for SPARC64 requirements.

 The Red Hat gcc 2.96 compiler subtree can also be used to build this tree.
 You should ensure you use gcc-2.96-74 or later. gcc-2.96-54 will not build
 the kernel correctly.
