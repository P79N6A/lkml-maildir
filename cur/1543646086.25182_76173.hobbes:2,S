Your initramfs patches will enable this to happen :)

All devices that have a "struct device" (which should be about
everything these days, if not, please let me know), cause a
/sbin/hotplug event to happen.  This event says what type of device was
added or removed, and includes the location of the device in the
driverfs tree so that userspace can then determine what it wants to do
with this device.
I'm working on adding a call to /sbin/hotplug when classes are
registered with the kernel (like disk and other things that live in the
class driverfs tree).
Is this enough information to do what you need?
thanks,
