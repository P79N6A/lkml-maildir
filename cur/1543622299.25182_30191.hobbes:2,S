Yes right. But first please really really think again what ST509 and MFM
controllers are ;-). And after all I have already heard some time
before some real complains from real users around me about the
particular behaviour currently present, which tried to use software raid 
on ATA disks. And after all please have a look at the note from Andires 
inside the patch, which has been there for a long time now.
Hmm I will perhaps have just to check what distro-backed-kernels do
here... Becouse if my memmory is right, they are removing this 
particular function too already...
If you have any objections please *point me* at a particular system
where this would really break things.
