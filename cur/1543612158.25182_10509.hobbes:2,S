I'm not sure if I was understood here.  On both Mandrake 8.0 and Red
Hat 7.1 I'm running the 2.4.16 kernel with the same .confg file, and
built on there respective kernel.  And I'm getting the below different
memory usage patterns with the same processes running.  Seems
something external to the kernel is causing the differences.
As of this morning, December 5th, the Mandrake systems has run longer
then the same kernel ever did on Red Hat.  I say again, with the same
kernel source and same .confg file.
