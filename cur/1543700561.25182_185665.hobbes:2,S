Subject: 2.6.0 modules don't link properly

I tried building 2.6.0-final on a new whitebox-3.0-final install, and
the modules_install produced thousands of unresolved symbols. This built
on another machine I've been running and updating since the 2.5.3x days,
so there might be something I've missed, but I don't quite see what it
would be.
Whitebox is built from RH-ES-3.0 source, so the only things I updated
were the procps and modutils, using the last tar which didn't have "pre"
in the name. I see that there is a new tar, out nearly ten hours so it
must be stable, which has jumped from 0.9.15 to 3.0.15-pre1, but I'm
happily using something months old on other systems.
Can someone toss me a clue? Has anyone had a working build with
RH-ES-3.0? Yes, I know other things need to be done before I can
actually run the kernel, but being able to build would be nice, since I
got a new test system just for 2.6 test/demo use.
