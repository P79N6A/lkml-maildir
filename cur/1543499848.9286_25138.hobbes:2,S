Hi,
yet again, I have found two possible bugs in the 2.3.x tcp
stack:
- outgoing data isn't being sent over a ppp link. The connection
  seemingly stalls forever and eventually bleeds to death -- this
  only occurs on _outgoing_ connections.
  When I decrease /proc/sys/net/core/[rw]mem* to 8192, the data
  is sent out slightly faster (at about one packet every 30 secs),
  but still at an unacceptably slow pace.
  Small transfers work great. tcp_timestamps is turned off.
- as soon as the program is terminated and the connection reaches
  FIN_WAIT1 state, the data _is_ sent out about three times as fast
  as in ESTABLISHED state, but it's still intolerable.
There is about 1% packet loss on my connection. This is a situation
out of my control so some software workaround will have to be found.
"Fix the link" is _not_ an option in my case -- I can't control the
occasional electric leakage of radio channels on the local phone
lines...
regards,
