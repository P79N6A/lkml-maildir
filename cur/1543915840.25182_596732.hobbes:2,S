So I thing this is an example how chroot would not be really used. For 
DSO loading there is many better ways to load own DSO. Though is this 
feature described in chroot() manpage, I have not noticed that any 
serious project uses it.  But ok, this is a ferature of chroot(). Also 
FreeBSD does not support escaping chroot AFAIK. So this feature is very 
badly portable.
