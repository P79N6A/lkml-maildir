Hi Sam.
A bunch of us were discussing an issue this morning, and came across the 
problem that selects don't seem to be enforced in choice menus. To give a 
concrete example, a couple of us tried to make CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND select 
CONFIG_X86_GENERICARCH. After enabling SOFTWARE_SUSPEND, we want back to the 
subarchitecture menu, and could still select other subarches. Is this by 
design?
Regards,
Nigel
