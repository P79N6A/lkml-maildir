Alan,
 thanks for replying. Which 2.4.4-ac would you recommend? BUT, I
actually think that the pcmcia stuff broke already in the 2.4.3-ac
series at 9 or 10. At that point, I was to busy reporting it :-( Doing
new kernels on my notebook is kind of low priority... I had the
impression that either the rwsem or the pnpbios stuff was involved. As I
said, I did not follow up at that time.
