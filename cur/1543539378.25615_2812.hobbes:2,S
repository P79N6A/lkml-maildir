Ok, I'll bite...
Only one of i_rdev and i_size are needed at a time, so we could union
them.
i_zombie is only needed on diretories. i_flock is (I suspect) not
needed on directories, so we can union them.  They can be in the same
union as i_pipe and i_bdev I suspect (hmmm. can you lock range of a
block device?)
i_blksize is constant across filesystems, so it can be moved to the
superblock (I suspect that I am actualy wrong here. There is probably
a good reason for it to be in the inode, but I cannot pick it).
i_state is a long, and has 4 bits defined!  We should make it a char
and put it next to i_sock. Would save 7 bytes on an alpha.
Of the 356 bytes in struct inode (on i386) 132 are in the union at the
end.
The largest few components of these are:
  nfs_i  132
  ext2_i 116
  efs_i  104
  affs_i 104
  ufs_i  100
For people not using client-nfs, being able to compile witout it would
save 16 bytes per inode, 4%.
Turning our attention to ext2, as ext2 doesn't actually do
fragmentation of blocks, i_frag_no and i_frag_size could be removed
saving 2 bytes. not_used_1 could be removed (PLEASE!!) saving 4
bytes. 
All up, I suspect we could trim 10% off the inode size which might
almost be considered to be significant????
