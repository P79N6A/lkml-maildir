you are fundamentally wrong. In the end KVM is a fundamental and complex 
infrastructure that enables Linux to provide full hardware capabilities 
to another OS via the resources of this OS. This concept justifies a 
system call and a place in linux/kernel/. It's not fundamentally limited 
to x86 either. Full virtualization (and paravirtualization) makes sense 
on any platform. And there's no reason KVM be limited to full 
virtualization alone - both paravirtualization and accelerated guest 
drivers need a sane hypercall API.

you can expose everything as character drivers and ioctls, but that 
doesnt make it the right solution. It might /start out/ as a driver, 
because that's an easy to hack model, but the moment something becomes 
important enough (and virtualization certainly is such a model) it 
demands a system call.
Just like inotify started out as an ioctl hack, but then was 
(rightfully) moved to the system-call space. [ Which btw. was on your 
request ;-) ]
