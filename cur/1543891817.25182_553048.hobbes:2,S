Hi Paul,
I've got two problems working with this patchset:
1. A task can't join a cpuset unless 'cpus' and 'mems' are set.  These
don't seem to automatically inherit the parent's values.  So when I do
	mount -t container -o ns,cpuset nsproxy /containers
	(unshare a namespace)
the unshare fails because container_clone() created a new cpuset
container but the task couldn't automatically enter that new cpuset.
2. I can't delete containers because of the files they contain, and
am not allowed to delete those files by hand.
thanks,
-serge
