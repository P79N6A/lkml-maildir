As opposed to adding special cases to the kernel which are unswappable and
stand to tangle up bits of the generic vfs - eg we would have a vma with
a vm_file but that file would not be in the dcache ?
Is it really worth it. For temporary files unix has never adopted a tmpfile()
syscall because nobody has ever found mkstemp() a paticularly critical path
that justified it
