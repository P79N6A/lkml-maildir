It's a nice idea.  I was planning to alter the logic behind that nested
"if" anyway, and I'll keep your recommendation in mind when I do it.

I'm not sure exactly what the ffffffff value means -- maximum utilization?
Anyway, a UHCI host controller is a bus master and it can generate a lot
of activity depending on what USB devices are plugged in.  If no USB
devices are plugged, the controller will be suspended after 1 second.  
Of course then it shouldn't be accessing the PCI bus at all.
There is one exception to this.  Some manufacturers try to disable unused
USB ports on their motherboards by tying the overcurrent input permanently
high.  (This seems to be particularly common among laptops.)  With some
Intel controllers this strategy generates "device-connected" interrupts,
so the driver doesn't try to suspend the controller.  There's a patch to
fix this behavior currently being tested.
