Well, -mm1 didn't quite agree with my savage gfx drivers. But I'm 
booting with psmouse.proto=exps now, and it's working the way I'm used 
to now.
The Aspire 1300-series is quite different from the 1350 ones.. The 
touchpad on the 1300 will work like a charm without the synaptics driver 
(but no fancy stuff is supported, I guess). Before you could boot and be 
happy without the synaptics driver, now you probably have to install the 
synaptics driver to be happy.. Maybe that's not so good. :)
Could this touchpad use the "exps" proto as default and then you could 
reconfigure if you want to use the ALPS driver..?
