Low-latency patch was not accepted as a patched patch -- put in to the
kernel.  I were talking about a separate patch file kept out of kernel
but distributed with the kernel. But thanks for notifying it increases
the maintaining. 
Well, I suggest we audio people maintain a separate patch against some
up-to-date kernel. The rule "if it works, don't fix it" seems to apply
perfectly to the Ingo's original patch. Now the latency jumped from 2.3 ms
to 7 ms, and unless the situation doesn't change, we better move to
the original patch.
