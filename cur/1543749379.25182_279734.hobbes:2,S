Unless I'm mistaken, it won't work in all cases. Example:
    #define foo(...) { ... /* nefarious macro stuff here */ ... }
    if (some_condition)
        foo();
    else
        // do something nifty
The above would expand to:
    if (some_condition) {
        /* nefarious macro stuff here */
    };
    else
        // do something nifty
And that's not quite right.
