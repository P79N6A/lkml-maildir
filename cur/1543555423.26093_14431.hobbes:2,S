Something appears to be broken.  One of my servers is going through
seemingly random spontaneous reboots with nothing to indicate why.

It's a VIA Technologies chipset.  I had no problems with it on test8, it
ran happily for 29 days before the upgrade.  I build the kernel on the
same machine (nec versa lx) that I build with for all my other software.
boot dmesg is at 
http://stuph.org/dmesg-lastboot,
 I don't have anything
else to go on at the moment, consider this a heads up that something is
broken.
