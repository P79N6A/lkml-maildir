My patch should not make any difference here, since
balance_pgdat() already scans the zones from high to
low and sets an end_zone variable that determines the
highest zone to scan.
All my patch does is make sure that we do not try to
reclaim excessive amounts of dma or low memory when
a higher zone is full.
