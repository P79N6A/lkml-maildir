Hello again,
I have already mentionned that twice, but got no sign of interest ;-)
The NFS server is running its own NIS server, and, so, is bound to itself.
Sometimes (quite frequently in fact), when a NFS client attempts to
mount a partition of the server, both ypserv and rpc.kmountd loop
scanning some files (/etc/hosts.allow, /etc/hosts.deny, the NIS domainname
/var/yp/<nis domaine> directory for ypserver, and /var/yp/binding/<nis dom>
and /etc/hosts, with connections to the yp server for rpc.kmountd).
Both consume a lot of CPU, and do not reply. So, the mount requests fail.
The situation can last for a couple of minutes. Have I done something
wrong in setting a local NIS server on the machine ?
Secondly, we have still a veeeeeery long time spent by rpc.kstatd in
the rc script when the system reboots (showmount -a shows around 100
connected machines). It lasts sometimes 10 minutes, which is too long
for a server.
Still no advice ?
Thanks in advance, because these NFS problems are really showstoppers
to use 2.2.x as servers in our network.
A+
