Excellent -- I've been meaning to do this (and occasionally hacking on
it half-heartedly before getting distracted by something else shiny) for

It looks good in general.

Why? Those header files shouldn't be included from anywhere _but_ the

instead of living in include/linux/foo_fs.h. 
And please, _never_ make anything dependent on CONFIG_foo_MODULE.
