Which is not an improvement at all.

Nice chunk to demonstrate.
Before one could write this like:
	smp_wmb();			smp_wmb();
	next->prev = new;	or	prev->next = new;
	prev->next = new;		next->prev = new;
And both examples aren't buggy.
After, you can't write:
	next->prev = new;
	rcu_assign_pointer(prev->next, new);
Guess why?
This barrier is related not only to next assignment, but to the whole
group of assignments.
