Well, yes, except that we use the in-kernel resource address for the
actual ioremap() _anyway_ in the routine that calls this, so if X has
remapped the ROM somewhere else, that wouldn't work in the first place.
I'm sure X plays games with this register (I suspect that's why the Matrox 
thing broke in the first place), but I don't think it should do so while 
the kernel uses it. 
I don't think we have much choice anyway. See above.
