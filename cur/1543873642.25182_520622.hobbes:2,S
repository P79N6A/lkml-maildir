Congratulations.  Sometimes these problems have easy solutions.  :-)

There's no warning because the driver doesn't know anything is wrong.  
Even though it may not find any devices to manage when it first gets 
loaded, there's nothing to prevent you adding, for example, a PC-card with 
a USB controller on it at some later time.
That's true in general for most Linux drivers.  (The ones that aren't
platform-specific, anyway.)  They don't look for devices to manage at load
time; instead the driver core calls their probe() routine later on.  
Consequently drivers can't tell at load time whether there will be any
useful work for them to do.
