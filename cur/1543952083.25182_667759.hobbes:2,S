Ext3's journal probably hides a huge number of problems.  I'd try
something with a lot more parallel modifications to metadata.  Say
postmark with a large number of threads.  It would be interesting
actually to get some controlled results of exactly how busy a
filesystem has to be before you get filesystem corruption (which I
would check explicitly running "e2fsck -f" e2fsck after pulling the
plug on the drive).
