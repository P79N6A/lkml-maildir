One 32 bit word per evicted page that we keep track of.

At this point, when we see that a refaulted page is more
active than the coldest page on the active list, we can
also immediately shrink the active list.  That gives the
next inactive page a better chance to get promoted before
it gets evicted.

The problem is that most of the distro patches are
kludges, which we would rather not see again in
future kernels.  They tend to work around the problem,
instead of being a proper fix, since reorganizing the
VM in the middle of a release is not an option.
However, incremental small-to-medium changes might
be an option for the upstream kernel, if you are
interested.

Few objections, but sadly also very few people interested in
actually reviewing the design :(
If you can find holes in

please let me know :)
