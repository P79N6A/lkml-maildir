yes - but there are a couple of early udelays, which would thus be 
affected.

i dont think this should matter: old systems that truly _need_ the ISA 
delay will be slow enough to not trip up. (nor are they really affected 
by these early delays - the delays were more for crappy ISA devices that 
get initialized later down, when the delay loop is already calibrated)
modern systems learned to depend on the PCI write posting side-effects 
of port 0x80 activities - those wont be helped by this initialization 
change either. That is a far more serious concern.
