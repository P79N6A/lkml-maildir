Al is proposing doing the same thing directly in the VFS instead of 
using a magic filesystem as I've described in the document.

What do you mean by this?  Something that doesn't show up in 
/proc/mounts?  I don't see this as much of an issue..  On any decently 
large machine, there are so many entries anyway that /etc/mtab and 
/proc/mounts become humanly unparseable anyhow.

Yup.  But still, one of the nice things about a full automounter 
solution is accessing a netapp with hundreds of exports through /net in 
a reasonably fast way.

Could be.  Either way, on a system with a thousand NFS shares 
automounted, I'm not really concerned about what the mounttable looks 
like.  It won't be human parseable anyway.

No, you're module doesn't use vfsmount_lock.  At least the module in 
autofs4-2.4-module-20031201.tar.gz doesn't.

This isn't lazy mounting per se.  If you are talking about autofs4's use 
of AUTOFS_INF_EXPIRING, it's there to prevent somebody from walking into 
a multimount while it is expiring.

The underlying autofs filesystem?  Sure.
