I'm aware of the init problem, what I described was the core problem,
which prevents any further cleanup.
The usecount is optional, the only important question a module must be
able to answer is: Are there any objects/references belonging to the
module? It's a simple yes/no question. If a module can't answer that, it
likely has more problem than just module unloading.
How that interface is exactly done is open for discussion and needs to be
specified.

I don't see your problem, if someone looks up a module, he gets a
reference to the module structure, if a reference count goes to zero the
module must be completely freed. State changes are protected with a
separate lock, if a module is loaded/unloaded an extra reference is used
to prevent module removal.
