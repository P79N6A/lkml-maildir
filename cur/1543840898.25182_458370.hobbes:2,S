grepping for `ioctl' gives:
ioctl(9, SIOCGIWNAME, 0xbfe38d8c)                 = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
ioctl(9, SIOCETHTOOL, 0xbfe38d2c)                 = 0
ioctl(11, SIOCGIFHWADDR, {ifr_name="eth0", ???})  = -1 ENODEV (No such device)
ioctl(11, SIOCGIFFLAGS, {ifr_name="eth0", ???})   = -1 ENODEV (No such device)
Perhaps you could generate the strace output for 2.6.18-rc5, grep that for
ioctl, look for differences?  That initial SIOCGIWNAME failure is fishy.
