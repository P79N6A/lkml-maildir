Grr.. My ia64 compiler is way too slow.  It just told me I had some
trivial bugs in the altix portion of what I posted.   Sorry I forgot
to mention all I can do is compile test ia64.
So here comes a second time with code that actually compiles :)
Darn this code that is so ugly that you have to test the cleanup on
multiple architectures!
