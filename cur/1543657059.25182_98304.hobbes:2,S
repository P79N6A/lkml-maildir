Well actually I ordered a complete replacement system - identical in every
way.  So I am getting that on saturday, and presumably that will just be
the big hammer that makes every problem go away.
I am just posting to get a head start on the issue if, for some crazy
reason I replace all hardware and the problem continues.  Sounds like that
is a slim to none chance, since I am dealing with good hardware (dell) and
it looks like this is a faulty component at work.
Basically I am just moving the disks from one machine to another on
saturday, and I suspect the problems just disappear when I do that.
Comments on the possibility that the problems continue after moving the
disks to different (but identical) hardware ?
thanks!
