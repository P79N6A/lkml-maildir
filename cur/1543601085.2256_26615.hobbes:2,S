I bet that's the same problem I had booting a zImage directly from an
El-Torito CD.  The problem was the autoprobing for the floppy type
performed by the boot loader.  It detected a 2.88 drive and issued
corresponding read requests (track x, 36 blocks; track x+1, 36 blocks;
...).  The bios performs these request, but it emulates a 1.44 disk so
the last 18 blocks of track x are actually the blocks from track x+1.
In my case I did not even got a crc error but an immediate reboot.
I removed the autoprobing from bootsect.S and fixed it to 1.44MB format
et voila, it worked perfectly.
Ciao, ET.
PS: Maybe that's the same problem lilo has on some systems with the
linear option...
