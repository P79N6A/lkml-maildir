You do realize what "evolution" means? I'm not talking about the bugs
in implementation. I'm talking about botched design. _That_ never gets
fixed. Show me one example when that would happen and I might consider
taking such possibility seriously.

No. The larger it is - the harder it is to redesign. And both GNOME and
KDE are _way_ past the size*severity_of_misdesign threshold. IOW, I simply
don't believe that either project has sufficient manpower to fix their stuff.
And that's orders of magnitude insufficient. As far as I can see they are
also way past "it's easier to do from scratch than to fix" threshold. The
same reason why I don't believe that NT will ever become decent OS, even
if the full source would become available, yodda, yodda.
Feel free to prove me wrong, but I would be very surprised to see it. And
yes, the fact that UNIX was conceptually simple and relatively small helped
it _big_ way. Small beasts adapt and propagate. Huge ones tend to become
dead-ends. So much for evolution...
