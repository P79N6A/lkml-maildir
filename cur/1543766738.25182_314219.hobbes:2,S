Have you ever looked at what "make tags" gives you?
Run  make tags  in the kernel source dir, then open up a source file in 
vim, place the cursor over some struct name or function name and press 
CTRL+] and you'll be taken to the definition, you can drill down several 
levels like that, and if you want to go back up one level to where you 
were you simply press CTRL+t  very useful when navigating the source.
