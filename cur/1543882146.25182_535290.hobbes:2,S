No disagreement there. It's really hard to pick good
hardware other than remembering the odd kernel hacker
comments , or grepping for expletives in the source
and piping through wc :)

Thanks for the comments. After running cyclictest it definitely looks
like the average jitter is really low, around 7-8 . The max is really
high , >100
If I am interpreting this correctly for the most part the jitter is
pretty low, but something horrible is happening that blows up the
max value.
