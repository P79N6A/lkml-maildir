Unfortunately I can not myself comment on the feature at this point,
however the code is pretty obvious :).
I'll go ahead and change it so that it returns the result of
sierra_set_ms_mode.
Also, I realized that the second patch (02/02) fixes a bug in the first
patch (01/02), particularly the dev_dbg messages are implemented
incorrectly in the first patch. I'll move that fix up to the first
patch.
I'll wait another day for other comments and then resubmit with those
changes.

Is this some type of CD-ROM simulation to provide drivers?

This is not a good idea in the long run. If you don't return an error
here,
disconnect() will be called for your driver and will have to deal with a
semiinitialized device.
