Well, it's zone->temp_priority, which was set to DEF_PRIORITY at the
top of the function, though I suppose something else might have
changed it since.

Yes, but it's not. We fall off the bottom of the loop, and set it
back to temp_priority. At best, the code is unclear.
I suppose shrink_zones() might in theory knock temp_priority down
as it goes, so it might come out right. But given that it's a global
(per zone), not per-reclaimer, I fail to see how that's really safe.
Supposing someone else has just started reclaim, and is still at
prio 12?
Moreover, whilst try_to_free_pages calls shrink_zones, balance_pgdat
does not. Nothing else I can see sets temp_priority.

You think it's doing something wrong? Or just unnecessary?
I'm inclined to think the whole concept of temp_priority and
prev_priority are pretty broken. This may not fix the whole thing,
but it seems to me to make it better than it was before.

Google production workload. Multiple reclaimers operating - one is
down to priority 0 on the reclaim, but distress is still set to 0,
thanks to prev_priority being borked. Hence we don't reclaim mapped
pages, the reclaim fails, OOM killer kicks in.
Forward ported from an earlier version of 2.6 ... but I don't see
why we need extra heuristics here, it seems like a clear and fairly
simple bug. We're in deep crap with reclaim, and we go set the
global indicator back to "oh no, everything's fine". Not a good plan.
