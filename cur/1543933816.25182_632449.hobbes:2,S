Hello.
I was interested in getting dynticks to work on my compaq presario v6000
to help with the 1 hour thirty minutes battery time, but after this
discussion I lost interest.
I too had the early boot time hang, and found it was udev triggering the
bug.
Changing the /etc/init.d/udev script so that the line containing
/sbin/udevtrigger
to
/sbin/udevtrigger --subsystem-nomatch="*misc*"
seemed to fix things.
the hang is triggered specifically by 
echo add > /sys/class/misc/rtc/uevent
after inserting rtc.ko
Also using hwclock to set the rtc , will cause a hard hang, if you are
using 64bit linux. Disable the init scripts that set the time, or use
the 32bit binary, as suggested here :

I hope this helps. But your hardware is slightly different though.
