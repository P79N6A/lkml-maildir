Yeah, I think it's useful to have ID's for each VM as well as for each
task. There are some things that make sense on a task level and other
things that make sense on a VM level.

If there is the ability to identify the VM with an ID, then it would
make sense to follow POSIX semantics for signal delivery if you did
this. If you send a signal to the task ID, then it would make sense to
follow pthread_kill() semantics as closely as possible (pthread_kill()
doesn't work with threads outside your VM, so this would be more
sophisticated --and perhaps slower?).

I think perhaps there needs to be a different ID from the "kernel pid"
which is shared only if CLONE_VM is used. Does this make sense?

Yes, I like this concept a lot. It might even be possible to push a
lot of that into userspace with some minimal hooks in the kernel.
