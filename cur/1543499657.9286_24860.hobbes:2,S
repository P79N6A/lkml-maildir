If a driver is going to allocate random resources, what could we
possibly do about it?  Next to the infinite number of more painful
ways that a rogue driver could mess things up, why should we even be
concerned about this?  If we can't count on drivers to know what
resources their devices use, what should we count on, instead?

I don't know what you mean by "arbitrate" here.  Can you give an
example where this would be useful?  When would we ever want two
drivers to share the same device address space?
