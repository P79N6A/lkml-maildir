Iv'e seen this on a system with 36" IDE ata/100 cables.  I have the same 
exact system using 24" IDE ultra ata/100 cables and I get no such 
errors.  These two systems are exactly the same and are using the same 
drivers, same hardware.
The only difference is the type of cable used.  Could this be due to bad 
cables as well?  (I know tha CRC errors are caused by bad cables, but this 
is the only difference in the two boxes that I have).
Keep the cables as short as possible, 18" is supposed to be the limit.
And please post again if you successfully troubleshoot this problem.
Jasmeet.
