bte_crb_error_handler() is called from hubiio_crb_error_handler()
in arch/ia64/sn/io/sn2/shuberror.c.  That's why bte_error.c is
in the same directory as shuberror.c (and not in arch/ia64/sn/kernel
with bte.c).
If bte_error.c is merged, wouldn't it make more sense to
merge it with shuberror.c?
Thanks,
