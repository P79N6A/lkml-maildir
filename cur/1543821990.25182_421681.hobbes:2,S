bzImage has some real mode code that gets information from the BIOS
and passes it to the vmlinux (see Documentation/i386/zero-page.txt)
grub would need to pass this information first before it could execute
vmlinux directly.
There are also some more complications on x86-64: vmlinux currently
assumes it starts in 32bit protected mode, not 64bit.
