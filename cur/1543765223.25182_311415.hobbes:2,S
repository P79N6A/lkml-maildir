With the last few kernels I haven't had a chance to retest the problem
that pushed us in the direction of using mlock. I will go back and do
so with the latest kernel. Below I've given a quick description of the
issue.

The driver did use get_user_pages() to elevated the refcount on all the
pages it was going to use for IO, as well as call set_page_dirty() since
the pages were going to have data written to them from the device.
The problem we were seeing is that the minor fault by the app resulted
in a new physical page getting mapped for the application. The page that
had the elevated refcount was still waiting for the data to be written
to by the driver at the time that the app accessed the page causing the
minor fault. Obviously since the app had a new mapping the data written
by the driver was lost.
It looks like code was added to try_to_unmap_one() to address this, so
hopefully it's no longer an issue...
