One way around this is to not mount the card.  Use mtools instead.
You will need to edit /etc/mtools.conf to assign a drive letter to
the card.  Since it may vary, you can have /etc/pcmcia/fixed.opts
call a script which edits the file to set a given drive letter to
the newly inserted card.  It it all very straight-forward, but is
left as an exercise for the reader.
