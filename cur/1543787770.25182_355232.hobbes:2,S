 hi, christoph,
 i assume that your global world-wide distribution of this message
 was a mistake on your part.  but, seeing as it _has_ gone out to
 literally thousands of extremely busy people, i can only apologise
 to them on your behalf for the mistake of wasting their valuable
 time.
 let's also hope that people who believe that comments such as the one
 that you have made are useful and productive also think about the
 consequences of doing so, bear in mind that internet archives are
 forever, and also that they check whether the person that they are
 criticising drinks at _all_.
 personally, my average consumption of alcohol can be measured
 as approx 1 bottle per decade.  and i'm not talking meths.
 if you don't like what i have to say, and don't want to listen,
 even with a pinch of salt to me rambling, learn how to set
 up a killfile, and use it.  and think more before hitting the
 reply-to-all button.  key.  whatever.
 l.
