two comments regarding the right of an author to freely choose under 
which license(s) he wants to make his patch available:
If a submitter wants to allow you to use his patch under both licenses 
he's already able to allow you to do so.
You can't forbid people to send GPL-only patches, so if a person doesn't
want his patch under your looser license you can't enforce that he also
releases it under your looser license.
