OK, I've begun the BK process again.
This driver is now in BK at
bk://linux-scsi.bkbits.net/scsi-qla2xxx-2.6
I didn't see any comments about Christoph's patches, so is it OK if I
apply them?
I plan to let it mature in it's own tree for a short while with the
object being to get it into the right shape for a 2.6 inclusion
candidate.
The two items we still need to do something about are:
- Multi Pathing.  This really doesn't belong in the kernel
- The odd ioctl set to the qla device...I'd much rather see something
more standard that all FC drivers can use.
