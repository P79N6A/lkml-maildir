strace that, and see how many times close() gets called.  If it gets
called once, it's a kernel bug.  If it gets called once for each open
file, it's a userspace bug.
For bonus points, how did you verify that all the open files were closed?
(Hint - what does that fp->_chain = stderr *really* do? ;)
