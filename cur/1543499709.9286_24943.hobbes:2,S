Hi,
This question comes up occansionally.
As a rule (AFAIK), LBA does not work/is not supported on the
secondary controller chain.
By fdisking it as a primary first, the partition table will
have the LBA geomtery but it is still using the normal geometry.
Linux simply sees the difference and compensates.
DOS still won't see past 1024 *real* cylinders on that disk on
the secondary chain. Basically, I always put my harddisks on the
primary chain and my cdroms on my secondary.
Hope this helps...
Martijn
