Hi,
It looks like the CMOS clock gets corrupted during the suspend to disk
on i386.  I've observed this on 2 different boxes.  Moreover, one of them is
AMD64-based and the x86_64 kernel doesn't have this problem on it.
Also, I've done some tests that indicate the corruption doesn't occur before
saving the suspend image.  It rather happens when the box is powered off
or rebooted (tested both cases).
Unfortunately, I have no more time to debug it further right now.
Greetings,
Rafael
