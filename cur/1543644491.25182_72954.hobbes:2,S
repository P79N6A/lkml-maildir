Justin,
One thing I notice is at least one PCI posting bug.  When using MMIO 
(write[bwlq] under Linux), you _must_ use a read[bwlq] to flush the 
write to PCI, if you wish to ensure the write posts at a certain point 
in the code.
Here is the example PCI posting bug, in ahc_clear_critical_section:
>                 ahc_outb(ahc, HCNTRL, ahc->unpause);

>                 } while (!ahc_is_paused(ahc));
As you can see, there is no read before the udelay(), which is very 
wrong on modern CPUs with write posting...  that's definitely a driver 
bug that will bite you on modern x86 motherboards [and is totally broken 
on ia64 and other platforms].
Please let me know if you have further questions on PCI write posting...
