You've mentioned that you also tried 2.5 and you don't see any difference 
there. I am very interrested to hear what version of 2.5 you tried.
I am using 2.5.69 + some patches and it does not suck or behave brain dead 
like 2.4 does. For me I've quit with 2.4 from now on.
2.5 still has many things to do / to fix but 2.5 is _active_ developed and 
fixes _are_ going into 2.5 where 2.4 does not accept real bug fixes.
If you want to give 2.5.69 a try, please apply the attached patch if you want 
to use it for your desktop. It gives you more interactivity.
