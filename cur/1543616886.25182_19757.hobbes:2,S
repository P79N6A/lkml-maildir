I don't doubt that, but would you seriously consider the ll patch for
inclusion into the main kernel?
It's a useful patch for anyone, who needs good latencies now, but it's
still a quick&dirty solution. Preempt offers a clean solution for a
certain part of the problem, as it's possible to cleanly localize the
needed changes for preemption (at least for UP). That means the ll patch
becomes smaller and future work on ll becomes simpler, since a certain
type of latency problems is handled automatically (and transparently),
so you do gain something by it.
The remaining places pointed out in the ll patch are worth a closer look
as well, as mostly now we hold a spinlock for too long. These should be
fixed as well, as they mean possible contention problems on SMP.

The possibility of priority inversion problems are not new, it was
already discussed before. It was considered not a serious problem, since
all processes will still make progress. Preempt now increases the
likeliness such a situation occurs, but nonetheless the processes will
still make progress. In the past I can't remember any report that
indicated a problem caused by priority inversion and so I simply can't
believe it should become a massive problem now with preempt.

Please let me rephrase, I just don't expect terrible good latency
numbers with non dma hardware.
