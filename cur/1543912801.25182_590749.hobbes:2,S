As Adrian already commented it is fixed in kbuild.git.
It happes bacause genksyms did not know __extension__ and error recovery
in the parser were bad. I only managed to add support for __extension__ but
the error receovery are not fixed :-(
kbuild.git is not part of this -mm due to me fucking up the above fix.
That is corrected now so it will be in next -mm.
