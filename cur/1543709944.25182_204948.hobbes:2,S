Ok, it's pretty harmful. I was just telling Andrew last week that I
wanted to add sense checking for whether we should fall back to pio or
not. Probably something as simple as checking for sense key 0x04 or 0x0b
and then skipping dma completely, all others keep going.
Thanks for testing, I'm pretty happy with the results you got. They are
just a bit too conservative, rather that than throwing up.
