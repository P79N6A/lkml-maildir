We always did that.  Before the patch the code segment looked like the
following.
	/* Final destruction now noone is using it. */
	if (mod->exit != NULL) {
		mutex_unlock(&module_mutex);
		mod->exit();
		mutex_lock(&module_mutex);
	}

I think this sort of temporary unload blocking would be useful for other
cases like this.
