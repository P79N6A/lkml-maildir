The pgd slab is not fully removable in the PAE case because a dedicated
slab is the only way to enforce alignment for allocations as small as
PAE PGD's.

That, not to mention the total lack of verification of the pageattr.c

Yes, another reason why it shouldn't have been posted as-is. It was not
intended to for anything more than comparative benchmarking on systems
without graphics running on the bare metal as opposed to Xen/etc. guests.
