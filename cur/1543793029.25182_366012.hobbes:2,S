in memory it'll look something like this
0                 2                   4                         6
-- kernel text -- + -- kernel text -- + --- k. text-- rodata -- + --    
normally the range from 0 to 6 is covered with 2Mb tlb's.
Now to make rodata read only, the hugetlb entry covering 4-6 Mb range
needs to be split into 4Kb entries, so that the rodata portion can have
different permissions than the rest of that range.
