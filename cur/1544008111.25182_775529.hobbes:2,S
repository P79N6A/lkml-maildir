Please file a bug so we can track this issue.
By "reload" do you mean reflash the BIOS? Can you be more specific about the symptoms?

The NVM corruption issue that was resolved (I presume this is what you meant) was root caused to CONFIG_FTRACE being enabled in the kernel and only on ia32 arch. If you're seeing this problem on x86_64 then it is most likely unrelated.
I also presume that you are using e1000e that ships with OpenSUSE 11.1. Have you tried using the latest e1000e from sourceforge?
Thanks,
