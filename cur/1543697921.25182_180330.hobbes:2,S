That actually does seem to have done the job. I thought subtree_check
only affected exports that aren't entire filesystems, but I guess it
does something to the filehandles anyway. Thank you, at least now I
have something to fall back upon if no other solution presents itself.

I see... I thought it would try to get a new filehandle to the same
file somehow.

I'll do my best, but I don't know how long it will take me. It is
extremely hard to predict when it will happen, so tracing the actual
fault won't be easy.
I'll post again when (and if) I manage to get a good trace.
