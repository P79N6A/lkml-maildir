I believe I have hit this as well, by starting 500kbps streams on 500
vlans at once.  My machine locks so hard that I have not been able to
get any info out of it...but the realtek driver shows and error message
about not being able to allocate any buffers if I ping it....
I was using kernel 2.4.21 or so, and had tcp buffers turned up
quite high.  I have seen this on P-IV and AMD (single Athlon) systems,
as well as a VIA C3.
