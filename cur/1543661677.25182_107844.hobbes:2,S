From the GPL version 2:
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  [...]
The critical part being, of course, "You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.".  But
this is offtopic.  MFT and Reply-To: set.
