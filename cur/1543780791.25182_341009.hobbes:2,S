No, I had thought it was possible to get into a situation where
one queue could be very loaded but not have anyone to pull from
it if total_load <= total_pwr.
I see that shouldn't happen though.
I have a variation on the 2nd part of your patch which I think
I would prefer. IMO it kind of generalises the current imbalance
calculation to handle this case rather than introducing a new
special case.
Untested as yet, but I'll queue it to send to Andrew after it
gets some testing - unless you have any objections that is.
Thanks,
Nick

Don't pull tasks from a group if that would cause the
group's total load to drop below its total cpu_power
(ie. cause the group to start going idle).
