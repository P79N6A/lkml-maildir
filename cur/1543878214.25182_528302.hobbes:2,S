Oh yes, your patch had nothing to do with it.
It was a more general, "do we want to allow multithreaded probing at
all" type question.  Some suggested that we allow it only by letting the
individual busses handle it (like we prototyped in the USB core),
instead of having the driver core do it.

Yes, it would be the same.

Ok, I'll keep the patch then and send it to Linus for 2.6.22, I didn't
realize your stuff would work well with it.
