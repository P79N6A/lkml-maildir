Did you monitor CPU usage during these tests?
I did some throughput comparing a DLink RTL8139 based card to a 3C905C-TX card on a K6-2 450.  
Both managed to fully saturate 100Mbps.  However, the DLink used up ~90% CPU, and the 3Com 
only used about 50% CPU.  This was on 2.4.5, with the 8139too driver from 2.4.3.
