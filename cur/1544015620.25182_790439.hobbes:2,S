My mistake. However,
http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/blob_plain/HEAD
:/hints/linux.sh
still has the issue, specifically:
if test -L /lib/libc.so.6; then
    libc=`ls -l /lib/libc.so.6 | awk '{print $NF}'`
    libc=/lib/$libc
fi
So, my version was incorrect, yet the problem still exists. I've got a
patch, need to submit it, yet Perl *does not compile* on a uclibc
target *as is*.
And this is why we should avoid adding new tools to build the kernel,
because they introduce yet more break points, as such.
Thanks.
