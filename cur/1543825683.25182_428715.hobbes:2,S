Subject: [PATCH] don't automatically drop packets from 0.0.0.0/8
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

For some reason linux drops all incoming packets which have a source
address in the 0.0.0.0/8 range, although these are valid addresses. The
attached patch fixes this. (It still drops packets coming from 0.0.0.0
since that's a special address.)
