that might be an accounting error in the oom killing then (even that
should be corrected in my tree or in the stock 8.1 SuSE kernel).
the reason normally oom accounting errors never showup, is that when the
amount of free-swap is >0, the oom-killer is never invoked (that's a
magic that probably avoids those situations to normally arise in the
stock kernel).
so maybe you had no swap, if you had no swap that would explain it.
and of course if you have 4G of ram and you know you've more than enough
ram then you'd be right using 0 swap (just the stock kernel oom killer
may malfunction, but that's not going to happen with the kernels I
suggested you to try, they'll be fine with 0 swap)
hope this helps ;)
