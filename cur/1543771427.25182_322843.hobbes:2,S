This looks like a Message-ID of my original email you're replied to.
Why you set up Reply-To header this way? :)

Both ways solves this problem for me.  Now I can insmod/rmmod
parport_pc as many times as I want:
parport: PnPBIOS parport detected.
parport0: PC-style at 0x378, irq 7 [PCSPP]
pnp: Device 00:0b disabled.
pnp: Device 00:0b activated.
parport: PnPBIOS parport detected.
parport0: PC-style at 0x378, irq 7 [PCSPP]
pnp: Device 00:0b disabled.
pnp: Device 00:0b activated.
parport: PnPBIOS parport detected.
parport0: PC-style at 0x378, irq 7 [PCSPP]
....
BTW, how "stable" pnpacpi=off is?  I mean, is it supposed to
work on more hardware than current default acpi-aware method?

Well, I figured this much ;)

I haven't seen any probs with acpi or bios or other things on
those boxen yet -- pretty good ones.  It's HP ProLiant ML150
machine (not G2).  There are other HP machines out here which
also shows the same problem - eg HP ProLiant ML310 G1.

Which patch was that?  I can try it here, but can't seem to be able
to find it...

The DSDTs are at 
http://www.corpit.ru/mjt/hpml150.dsdt
and 
http://www.corpit.ru/mjt/hpml310.dsdt
 (that's a
(binary) copy from /proc/acpi/dsdt -- is there a way
to decode it into some text form?)
Thank you for your time.  At least I now know I'm not
alone with this prob.. ;)
