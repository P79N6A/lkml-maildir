I'd actually be very interested in making this more generic, although
I'm unsure how. You have a very platform specific change to the linker
scripts, then a userspace implementation of that platforms gettimeofday.
Any suggestions as to what part could be generalized?  
As for the TSC, while its very true that the TSC can cause problems on
some systems, most systems still use it as a valid time source in
do_gettimeoffset(). Alternative time sources (cyclone, HPET) could be
mapped in and used as well on those systems that cannot use the TSC
reliably.  
thanks for the feedback!
