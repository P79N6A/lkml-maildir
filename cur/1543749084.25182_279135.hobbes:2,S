This sounds better and more general than my proposed ..../structure
file. So could you explain this in a bit more detail?
Would for instance the simplest (and default?) glueing code in your
bar/..../source file be
cat *
which just concatenates all the subcomponents in no particular order?

How would you do it?

Sounds really interesting.
