I'm wondering: Can these ratelimits be used to tell real forkbombs from
normal oops-i-hit-the-limits? I imagine if you have your private ratelimit,
that might just do the trick.
Beware: I have no idea on how much such an extra ratelimit would cost, and if
having that ratelimit-based detector would actually be a gain.
