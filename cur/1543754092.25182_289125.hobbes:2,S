Hi,
I have a great problem with the kernel 2.6.10
(www.kernel.org) and my usb-modem ELSA Microlink ISDN
Office. To surf in internet, I use wvdial (version 1.54.0).
The idle-time ist set to 300 sec.  This works very fine, but
the modem reaches the idle-time independet of traffic. 
For example: I get my mails and the modem hangs up after 300
sec with no error:
/var/log/message
pppd[9913]: Terminating connection due to lack of activity.
I hope, you can help me. TX
