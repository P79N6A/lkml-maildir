Interesting; I still have one such machine set aside for testing purposes,
so I can give that a try; in my limited testing, ADMA didn't exhibit the
same long latencies.
I'm just rolling up a 2.6.17 kernel patchset, so I'll pull in Jeff's
sata_nv branch and give it a try; the patch queue is long though, so
it will probably be sometime next week.

My workaround has been to just use John Stultz's new timekeeping
code (actually the variant in Thomas Gleixner's hrtimers rollup --
http://tglx.de/projects/hrtimers/
).  Our PostgreSQL servers now maintain
sub-millisecond NTP offsets, whereas previously they would drift 100+ms away,
lose sync, and require an NTP restart every day or so.
John wrote the other day:
   With the current code in -mm I can run a test app that disables
   interrupts for 2 seconds at a time over and over and I'm still keeping
   synched w/ an NTP server within 30 microseconds.
The patches in -mm are set to be merged in 2.6.18-rc1, so I have no qualms
about including them in my internal 2.6.17 patchset.
Kudos to John, Thomas, Ingo, and others who have worked on the new
timekeeping code.  This is yet another area where work on the -rt kernel
benefits everyone in a measurable way.
