Just adding explicit all over the place is really the worst solution. 
Check if you can adjust data types/function prototypes.
Lots of the signed stuff was added as a warning fix for Solaris, I'd 
rather drop that than adding casts all over the place. So you also may 
want to check the file history, why certain constructs were added.
