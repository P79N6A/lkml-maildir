Indeed, that is quite significant to know here.

Since Intel doesn't list any other device codes, I suppose there are none.
But of course, it's not entirely impossible that there are others, but I
wouldn't want to relax the already weak check; I'd rather want to add
other device codes if we have proof that these are valid.
