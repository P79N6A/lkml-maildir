OK.
Interestingly enough, the drive wasn't being used at all during the timeframe
when the messages show up - at least, not explictly. Perhaps some random process
was polling the drive....
Alan, I tried 2.4.20rc4-ac1 but while the patch took, it wouldn't compile. I'll
try again later and fwd where the error was. (I don't have access to that machine
at the moment)
