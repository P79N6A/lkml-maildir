although this certainly appears to be the case in general, it hasn't
been true of latency. Not only is 2.4.0-anything worse than 2.2, but
Linux is probably the slowest of any OS that anyone I know has looked
into when it comes to return-from-interrupt-driven scheduling. it
could be that this is because nobody has bothered to pay much
attention to this issue. if so, i just hope that these exchanges will
do something to change that.
in fact, over the last 2-3 years that i've been following
linux-kernel, the only time that *general* concerns about scheduling
latencies have come up seem to have been at the instigation of someone
doing audio or video work. there's been a lot of attention paid to the
minutae of schedule(), but vastly less to the basic question of when or
how often it gets called. this is my impression, at least.

historically, they *have* been ignored, at least as a practical
matter. i doubt that anyone was trying to ignore them, but the result
has been incredibly long delays in scheduling under many common
situations. we're not talking about mindcraft/finessable differences
here, but factors of 5-100.

No, I was just using it as a demonstration of another way to fix the
problem. I wasn't arguing that Linux should do that.

I wasn't referring to anything he said about Linux. I was referring to
his willingness to take up some heresay about BeOS that came with no
numbers, no description, just a vague claim that "its getting
slower". In terms of its ability to get the equivalent of SCHED_FIFO
threads back on the processor after an interrupt makes them runnable,
this is not, AFAIK, true.
