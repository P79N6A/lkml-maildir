Thats not the problem (I still checked it though)
The problem is that screen that is showed will fit 1024x773 and not 
1024x768. Everything that I open starts at the very top of my screen but 
ends 3 or 4 pixels below. This does not happen with older kernels and 
with X and it is _not_ a monitor problem.
