I got fed up of telling people to reconfigure their MUAs a long time
ago and ended up with this in my .procmailrc
:0fw
| /usr/bin/perl -pe 's/^(Content-Type: .*)format=flowed/\1format=flawed/'
It doesn't solve all the worlds problems, but it least makes that crap
readable in _my_ MUA.  Sadly, if it's a patch that I have to apply
then chances are I'll have to get them to resend it with something
else anyway, as it's inevitably buggered in some other way because
thunderbird really is that dire.
I'm convinced there's some contest to see who can make the worst
graphical mail client for Linux. I'm not sure what the prize is,
or who's winning, but the entries so far are horrific.
