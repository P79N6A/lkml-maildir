I have just checked, but I still get the errors, although the patch looks fine
at first glance. I wondered whether I was doing something wrong, so I rechecked
and it compiles cleanly with 2.4.21, and does not since 2.4.22. Unfortunately,
I'm too tired to investigate more, so I should do it tomorrow. Here is the
compilation output, just in case it helps David. Please ask for .config if
needed, but I don't think so.
Cheers,
Willy
