After reading the posts about the MODULE_LICENSE macro, I am in disbelief. I 
was under the impression that one could write a "closed-source" module and 
distribute it in binary form, and be in compliance. Please tell me I am 
wrong? We use Linux as a platform for some data acquisition, and we are 
currently distributing ( in very limited quantity to people who would already 
have signed an NDA ) modules that currently have no official license as yet.
We are researching which license to use, but according to these post's we 
have almost no choice, Open Source or not at all!
