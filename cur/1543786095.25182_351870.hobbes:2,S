Dear diary, on Tue, Sep 20, 2005 at 01:15:38AM CEST, I got a letter
where Pavel Machek <pavel@suse.cz> told me that...

yes, I want to retain it. I'm not 100% decided yet whether to actually
use the pull term for anything in Cogito. Previous usage reportedly
confused some, the new usage actually confuses me and apparently some
other people. So I might just avoid the 'pull' term in the future
altogether. Not decided yet, though, and opinions obviously welcomed.

AIUI, that's what makes it a pull for *cough* some people. ;-)
