Ok I checked my system with one swap partition, no swap partitions and a 
swap file. One partition resulted in a crash but after a longer duration 
(two or three times as long. I cannot understand this). A swap file acted 
in a similar way to the single swap. After removing all swap the system 
was as stable as linux is rightly reputed to be.
The kernel does produce an oops when i crash it but for some reason the 
screen blacks out a few minutes later and i am unnable to finish recording 
the sym-debug stuff and cannot get useful information from it. It is not 
logged by klogd and I don't get much further then the registers. The 
message It gives me is unnable to handle kernel paging request at virtual 
address 00015e00 although of course this adress changes.
Is there anything else I can do?
