It will take a while to finish looking over those logs, but are you using ipv6? If not, please 
blacklist the ipv6 module to prevent it from loading - add the line 'blacklist ipv6' to file 
/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist. In some cases, ipv6 can cause timeouts even though you do not have any 
ipv6 routers.
