Same here. Just one of the discs that has stopped during the last month
has any entries in the log at all. Those errors are attached.
The funny thing is that the machine stops responding after the
dma_timer_expiry.. Why doesn't just the kernel (or the controller for
that matter) disable DMA and then the problem would be solved, if the
problem is related to DMA, right? Sure, the speed (or lack of it) would
be painful but I wouldn't need to sit 60km from home and wondering why
my box just stopped responding. ;/
