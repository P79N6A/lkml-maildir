You mean our fast path for flush_dcache_page
static inline void flush_dcache_page(struct page *page)
{
        struct address_space *mapping = page_mapping(page);
        if (mapping && !mapping_mapped(mapping)) {
                set_bit(PG_dcache_dirty, &page->flags);
        } else {
                __flush_dcache_page(page);
        }
}
Yes, that's the culprit...I suppose we could uninline it.
