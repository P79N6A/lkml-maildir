Sometimes someone comes with "I have this code NOW and if we just merge
it I'll fix it up properly". It's rejected, stating "come back when
you've fixed it up".
We don't even have that here. We have "I have this code NOW and when
it's merged I have no intention of fixing it up properly".
In my eyes I'd rather take the first one than the second, there at least
there's the INTENTION of fixing it up.
Oh and btw, I'm not pro- or against- reiserfs in any way. I haven't
tried reiserfs4 but I hear it's good so don't take this is a statement
of my like or dislike of it, I'm just stating something worth thinking
about.
