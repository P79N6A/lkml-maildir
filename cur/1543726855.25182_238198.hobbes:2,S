How does this differ from any other subsystem that supports
cards with features that may not be present in another model ?
Other subsystems have dealt with this problem without the need
to introduce horrors like the abstractions in DRM.

And among other horrors, crap like typedef's that magically change their
type completely depending on which file they are #include'd into.
Overuse of typedefs is one thing, but what goes on with stuff like
DRIVER_BUF_PRIV_T is bordering on obscene.
If this kind of abuse wasn't so widespread, abstracting this code
out into shared sections and driver specific parts would be a lot
simpler. Sadly, this is the tip of the iceberg.

Depends on which direction you're looking at things.
From the view of many kernel developers, anything would be
better than the trainwreck of wrappers/macros/preprocessor abuse
that's there right now.  I'd put money on a lot more people being
prepared to hack on DRM's kernel code if it were more readable.
To give an example of just how bad some folks view on this code is:
An actual conversation at OLS last week..
"I found it easier to look at the C preprocessor output than the
 actual source code to find the types of the variables I was looking at".

I don't maintain upstream DRM, but I have a fair amount of responsibility
regarding the Fedora kernel, and I'll state publically that looking at
bugs in drivers/char/drm is right up there on my list of
"things I'd rather not do after lunch". Maintainability goes much
further than 'the guy that wrote the code can grok it'.
People trying to pick up 3d driver programming on Linux have a huge
hurdle in their place, as that code resembles *NO OTHER* driver code
in the tree.

I spent 2-3 days a few months back attempting to clean up some of the
goo, by peeling away the layers of abstraction.  After the 3rd day,
I'd estimate I wasn't even a fraction of the way through, and I lost
the will to keep fighting.

ISTR SiS has some memory management code too, though I've not looked
too closely at that for a long time.
