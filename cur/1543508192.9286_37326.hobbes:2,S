Mind if I repeat your comment as quoted above:
 >>> There is only one date on a file on a VFAT partition...
Can I also point out that as far as backup programs are concerned,
they will consider a file as being a candidate for inclusion in an
incremental backup if the MODIFICATION time is more recent than the
timestamp the previous backup that it's incremental to. From their
perspective, the ctime is irrelevant.
Remember that under MSDOS, the purpose of the archive bit is to state
that the file has not been backed up since it was last modified, and
thus that the modification time is more recent than the last backup.

If you think about the semantics, you'll realise that's wrong. First,
let's remind ourselves what the various timestamps are:
 1. ctime is the time when the file was first created.
 2. mtime is the time when the file was last modified.
 3. atime is the time when the file was last accessed.
Therefore, the following relationship MUST hold...
	ctime <= mtime <= atime
...since a file can be neither modified nor accessed before it is
created, and modifying a file also constitutes accessing it.
I would therefore see something like...
	ctime = dos_time
	mtime = archivable ? now : ctime
	atime = mtime
...as being the correct semantics.
 > But how do you reset the Arch bit ?
I can see the following options:
 1. Have the code check whether a file is accessed sequentially
    from start to finish without missing anything out or reading
    anything twice, and without being modified, and if so, assume
    the program doing so just created a backup of the file, so
    reset the archivable bit when the file is closed.
 2. Have a special flag to be applied by the backup program when
    opening a file it wishes to back up, which indicates that it
    is backing up the file.
 3. Ignore the problem completely.
None of them particularly appeals to me, as I can see serious problems
with both, but I can't see anything better either...
Best wishes from Riley.
