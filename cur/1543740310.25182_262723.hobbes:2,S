i dont this this patch is correct, because it changes semantics by
pushing a security-subsystem failure back into userspace. There's
nothing wrong with two tasks trying to change a third task's policy in
parallel - our API allows that.
I agree that this is a very special case of lock dependency and that the
security subsystem should not be burdened with double-buffering messages
just to avoid the runqueue lock on syslogd wakeup. Only this single
scheduling-related system-call is affected by this problem.
i think the right solution would be to retry the permission check if the
policy has changed (an unlikely event). It is livelockable the same way
seqlocks are livelockable so i'd not worry about it too much. It is also
preemptible with PREEMPT so not a big issue. Also, the check & repeat
code should possibly be #ifdef CONFIG_SECURITY.
