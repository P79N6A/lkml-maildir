Okay, the faulting instruction is the following:
c0383360:       0f 1f 40 00             nopl   0x0(%eax)
The Crusoe code morphing software apparently doesn't recognize these 
"long noops", and (presumably) the rest of the hinting NOOP group.  gcc 
didn't use to generate them, and Crusoe/Efficeon generally do not 
benefit from code alignment anyway.  I suspect the best thing to do is 
to use either a 586 kernel or build a dedicated Crusoe kernel without 
code alignment.
