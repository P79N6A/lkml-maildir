both things, I learnt it later, but it's also because the anon-vma
pretty much "forced" me not to be lazy about the inodes ;). It's
something I planned already when I changed the mmap mering to handle
inodes too  and submitted to Andrew that merged it in 2.5 mainline, the
only reason I didn't do it at that time, is that it was originally
developed for 2.4, and the less changes the better, so at that time I
only fixed the showstopper inode-merging for mmap and not mprotect.
At 2.4 time I also planned eventually to add the vma merging to mlock
but it didn't happen yet ;).

Sure.
