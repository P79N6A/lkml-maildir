OK. Steve's audit_log_d_path() change, which I pulled in because it had
the side-effect of NUL-terminating the buffer, is now using GFP_KERNEL
where previously it was not. 
We could make it use GFP_ATOMIC, but I suspect the better answer if at
all possible would be to make sure that avc_audit doesn't call it with
spinlocks held. Or maybe to make avc_audit() pass a gfp_mask to it, but
I don't like that much.
