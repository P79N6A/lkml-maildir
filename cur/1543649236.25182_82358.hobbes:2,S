It's not too bad since the data can be reclaimed easily.
The problem in your case is that the dentry and inode cache
didn't get reclaimed. Maybe there is a leak so they can't get
reclaimed at all or maybe they just don't get reclaimed fast
enough.
I'm looking into the "can't be reclaimed fast enough" problem
right now. First on 2.4-rmap, but if it works I'll forward-port
the thing to 2.5 soon (before Linus returns from holidays).
regards,
Rik
