Here, it's possible to workaround the pipefs issue... with another kernel
bugfix.  uname -r is available in /proc/sys/kernel/version, but the problem
is that reading almost any file in /proc with shell, which does read by a
single byte, returns only first byte of of the file being read.  The bug
has been addressed by Andrew recently, but I don't remember if the fix is
in 2.6.20 or 2.6.19.x yet.  I discovered it exactly because of this very
issue - hit pipefs bug and tried to work around it by replacing the above
construct with
   read version < /proc/sys/kernel/version
   ... /lib/modules/$version/modules.dep ...
wich results in $version being set to.. "2" (from "2.6...." :)
But sure, the usage is wrong, albiet ok for some minimal debugging.

Not as I know of.  It has been discussed, but seems to be of low priority.
At least, reading /proc file is fixed... somewhere... :)  So it's now possible
to work around it, at least in some places (because sometimes pipe is really
useful anyway and difficult to substitute with something ;)
