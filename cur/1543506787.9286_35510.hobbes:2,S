Lots of complaints about multiple definitions in uart401.o,
opl3.o, and adlib_card.o.
Your problem is this:
>CONFIG_SOUND_ADLIB=y
>CONFIG_SOUND_YM3812=y
Check the Makefile: these two options cause the same set of
.o files to be included in the target set. This used to work,
but not anymore. Keep YM3812 and remove ADLIB. (They're not
entirely equivalent, YM3812 controls some stuff in dev_table.)
