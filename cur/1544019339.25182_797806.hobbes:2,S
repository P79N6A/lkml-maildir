Even in the 64-bit-integer on 32-bit-CPU case, you still end up with
the lower 32-bits in a standard integer GPR, and it's trivial to just
ignore the "upper" register.  You also would not need to do any kind
of bit-shift, so long as your inline assembly initializes both GPRs
and puts the halves of the result where they belong.
