Subject: Bug: Status/Summary of slashdot leap-second crash on new years 2008-2009

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Slashdot reported a story of Linux machines crashing on New years eve.
http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/01/01/1930202
Below follows a summary of the reported crashes. I'm ignoring the
zillions of "mine didn't crash" reports, or the "you're a paranoid
conspiracy theorist, its random chance" reports.
So far, 31 users reported 53 hard crashes at/near midnight, new years.
Symptoms are:
-- hard hang (systems not pingable)
-- irq's not serviced (if disk was active at time of crash,
   the disk activity light stays lit)
-- cold reboot (poweroff) required
-- systems work normally after reboot
-- no messages in syslog, no kernel oops, no core file crash dumps
-- not reproducible (simply setting the clock back is not enough
   to reproduce; guessing that a simulation of stratum 0 ntp server
   is needed to force the leap-second.)
-- The affected machines seem to be running either 2.6.21, 2.6.26 or 2.6.27
Suspect its an kernel race condition triggered by ntp bumping the second.
-- its the leap second, since this doesn't happen other years,
-- its a race condition, since some identically configured machines
   didn't go down, while others did.
-- its a race condition, since majority of systems were not affected.
-- its a race condition, since affected systems seem to have been
   mostly non-idle servers, or some non-idle desktops/ tv set-tops.
-- ntpd is the only service that monkeys with time adjustments.
There is a "well-known" deadlock in 2.6.21 kernels that caused this:

Here's the synopsis of individual reports.  Most folks left very little
info, nor did they leave a way to contact them.
