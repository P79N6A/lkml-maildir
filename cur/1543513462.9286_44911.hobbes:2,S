Subject: Patch to file compile fail with fdomain when DO_DETECT set to true

This patch fixes a compile problem when compiling the fdomain driver with
the DO_DETECT feature turned on.  Without this patch the compile fails
because two local variables weren't declared.  While the DO_DETECT feature
isn't turned on by default, at least my setup needs it as probably many
others do as without this turned on only 3 of 4 or 3 of 5 SCSI drives are
detected by the driver.
