I updated to 2.0.37 pre9 and suddenly wmifs stopped working. I
get the following message:
X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window
parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  62 (X_CopyArea)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  64
  Current serial number in output stream:  76
Wenn I boot back into 2.0.36 everything works fine.
Regards
Martin
