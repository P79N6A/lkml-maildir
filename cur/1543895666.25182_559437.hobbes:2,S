Yeah, extended attributes are typically used for exactly that:  
"attributes" like labels, permissions, encoding, cached file-type,  
DOS/Windows/Mac metadata, etc.  Sometimes people suggest sticking  
icons in there, but that's probably a bad idea.  At most stick an  
"icon label" attribute which refers to a file "/usr/share/icons/ 
by_attr/$ICON_LABEL.png".  If you're trying to put more than 256  
bytes of data in an extended attribute then you're probably doing  
something wrong.  They're very good for cached attributes (like file- 
type) where you don't care if the data is lost by "tar", and they're  
reasonable for security-related attributes where you don't want  
attribute-unaware programs trying to save and restore them (like  
SELinux labels).
