You can do even more than this -- I dunno what I/O interface these
embedded system generally uses (the mtd stuff?). Provided you provide a
direct make_request_fn entry into these instead of using the queue, you
can basically cut all of ll_rw_blk.c and elevator.c. ll_rw_block,
submit_bh, and generic_make_request would be all that is left.
That should reclaim quite a lot of space. If there's any interest in
this (has it already been done?), I can help out getting it done.
