OK, so are doing two kmem_cache_allocs for every new_inode.  With the 
unbork.fs patch you could save 50% of the kmem_cache_allocs by 
rewriting as follows:
    static inline ntfs_inode *NTFS_I(struct inode *inode)
    {
            /* should bug-check to be sure it's really one of ours */
            return (ntfs_inode *) &(inode->u);
    }
And you just fill in the inode_size field of the file_system_type 
declaration.  The vfs will then handle all the details of allocating/freeing 
inodes and the inode slab cache.  (Note that Al seems to think this is the 
wrong way of doing it, but hasn't said why he thinks that yet.)
For superblocks - are you sure you want a dedicated slab cache for those?  It 
seems to me that kmalloc is perfectly appropriate for this, and saves the 
code needed to set up, keep track of, and tear down the slab cache.
