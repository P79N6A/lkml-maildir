I submitted it for review 15 months ago. Since then I've been working to apply 
the suggestions, clean things up more and finish the last few bits of missing 
functionality. Contrary to what Sebas implied earlier, I'm not paid to work 
on Suspend2 on a full time basis. I work on it up to 20% of work hours 
(thanks, Cyclades), and the remainder of the work is done in my own time. 
This often means that things move more slowly than I'd like, but my wife will 
happily testify that I still spend too much time on it :)
Regards,
Nigel
