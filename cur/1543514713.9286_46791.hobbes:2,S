Check what happens if you get different pathes to the same place.
Consider the following picture:
a->b ->c ->d
 ->b'->c'->d'
Now, remove d. shrink_dcache_parent will not help here. Moreover, 
there are problems with inconsistent dcache state - stale dentries and all
such. It's simply not supposed to work that way.
The real fix will include the dcache changes, but that affect many
filesystems and some are pretty sensible. Yup, NFS is one of them.
