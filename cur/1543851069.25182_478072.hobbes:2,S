I'm working on making good use of this information:
--------------- 8< --------------
3.3.8.2 Concrete Inlined Instances
Each inline expansion of an inlinable subroutine is represented by a
debugging information entry with the tag DW_TAG_inlined_subroutine.
Each such entry should be a direct child of the entry that represents
the scope with in which the inlining occurs.
--------------- 8< --------------
To write this tool:
<Ralf> So imagine a tool which says function x was inlined y times
bloating the code by z bytes :)
