But they have to tell it to unplug the CPU, don't they? So if they ask
to unplug it but don't want it to unplug, then the kernel can only do
so much.
Or do we automatically unplug in response to some exceptions nowadays?
In that case, it might be better to have a sysctl that can cause it to
do some other behaviour than unplug.

Yes, then they'll be able to be migrated without changing their cpumask.
So what's the problem?

I don't quite understand you here... the kernel doesn't need to enforce
anything but a dumb fallback policy where userspace is otherwise capable
of handling it themselves.
