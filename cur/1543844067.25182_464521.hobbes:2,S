Depends how often you're inserting/removing probes, I guess.
Aren't these being done manually, in which case it really can't
be that many? Still doesn't fix the problem Matieu just pointed
out though. Humpf.

It's not exactly elegant or simple, but I guess it'd work if we have
to go to that extent. Seems like a lot of complexity though, I'd
rather get rid of the int3 trap if we can.
