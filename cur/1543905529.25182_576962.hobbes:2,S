Yes, but we need to use spin_lock_irqsave() from interrupt context to
synchronize between two hard irq contexts themselves.

Yup, this would avoid races, but then we will lose events. Why is that
acceptable, when better alternative (above) exists?
Seriously, your aversion to implement good, safe locking is amazing! :-)

The proper way to do this is to use a kernel buffer to do all kernel-side
work (you acquire/release lock during that work) and then copy_to_user()
later, at the end. [ And something opposite for the set_xxx syscall, i.e.
first off copy_from_user() to a kernel buffer up front, before doing
anything else itself, and then do all the work in the kernel on that. ]
BTW your syscall implementations totally lack any kind of security checks
whatsoever ...

Amazing. On the one hand, you want to use spin_trylock() in the hard irq
handler and spin_lock() (not irq safe) in the process context, because
you "don't care about losing some events". And now you want to avoid
"disabling irqs in user context to minimize possibility to delay events
recording"?
Anyway, any such requirement you're talking about is just bogus, IMHO.
You're just disabling interrupts to access a data structure, for Gods'
sakes, how many nanoseconds do you imagine would you be "delaying"?

Umm, I don't think the RFC supposes/assumes this anywhere.

Of course. BTW time_pps_findpath/findsource do not have to be kernel
implemented syscalls in the first place. The best, simplest and most
straightforward place to implement them is in userspace -- the RFC
mentions this as well.

A solution I can think of is to create a mapping at the time of
pps_register_source() between the PPS source (physically) and the special
char device. Userspace open(2)'s the special char device corresponding to
the PPS source, and then issues the time_pps_create() syscall. Here, we
lookup the mapping previously created and return handle to the PPS source
based on the special device's fd that's passed to us in time_pps_create().

Ok, I'll take a look, thanks :-)

open(PPSfilename, O_RDWR) doesn't sound like that at all. If the device
for the serial port / parport was intended, it wouldn't be called
"PPSfilename", would it?

The physical port/device through which a PPS source is connected is
immaterial. Anyway, I'll take a look at the NTPD/userspace code you are
mentioning as well. [ again, could you point me to URL of source code? ]

Sure, I'll get to implementing what I have in mind here -- will be glad
to be of any help, thanks.
