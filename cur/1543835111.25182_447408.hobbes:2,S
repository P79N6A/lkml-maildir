IMHO #3 sucks more, it's not as easy to spot when glossing over the
code, the underscores make it quite ugly (think _r________) and it's
less "greppable". If I know that there's something that sets S_ISUID, I
can easily search for that, compare that to [_cpdbl]{1}[r_]{1}[w_]{1}s...
And those S_I* things aren't that hard to parse actually. It starts with
the affected modes and then the "target user". So your example reads
like:
S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR:
Read - User Group Other | Write - User
It took me some time to realize that, but once you got it, it's easy.
