Hrm... this is a a pristine 2.6.16 without any patch applied ? Also,
what video chip revision do you have exactly ? (lspci will tell you)

Interesting... I suspect there is an endian bug in the new font code
that hits odd sized fonts (or non-multiple-of-8 fonts). Can you try
enabling 8x8 and 8x16 instead of 6x11 and 7x14 fonts and tell me if
those work ?
Tony: If my suspition is confirmed, I think that's your call :)
Cheers,
Ben.
