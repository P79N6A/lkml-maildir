Quite frankly, I'd much rather have something more like this:
	clear_pcix_errors(dev);
	..
	x = readX_check(dev, offset);	/* Maybe several ones, maybe in a loop */
	..
	error = read_pcix_errors(dev);
	if (error)
		take_pcix_offline(dev);
in other words, I'd rather _not_ see the "readX_check()" code itself have 
the retry logic and error value handling.
Why? Because on a number of architectures it is entirely possible that the 
error comes as a _asynchronous_ machine exception or similar. So I'd much 
rather have the interfaces be designed for that. Also, it's likely to 
perform a lot better, and result in much clearer code this way (ie you can 
try to set up the whole command before reading the error just once).
It is _also_ going to be a hell of a lot easier to disable the code if you 
want to, with just a
	#ifndef CONFIG_PCI_RECOVERY
	  #define clear_pcix_errors(dev) do { } while (0)
	  #define read_pcix_errors(dev)  (0)
	  #define take_pcix_offline(dev) do { } while (0)
	#endif
in a header file for architectures that don't support it.
Does anybody see any downsides to something like this?
