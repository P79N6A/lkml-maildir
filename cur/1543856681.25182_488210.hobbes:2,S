Fedora has a bug covering this:

If I recall correctly, it was pulled because there was some question as
to if it was actually needed (x86_64 didn't need it) and it slows down
the boot time (although not by much). 
I'm fine just re-adding it. Although if the number of affected systems
are small we could just blacklist it (Ian, mind sending dmidecode
output?).
Andi, your thoughts?
