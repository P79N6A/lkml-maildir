Just as an FYI - this is "in the pipes" for ext2/ext3 also, which the
(very basic) support for variable-sized inodes that Ted has already
submitted is the groundwork for (among other things).  We will then have
space to add usec timestamps to ext2/ext3 inodes for people who choose to
have larger inodes (new filesystems only, to start with), and when we get
more efficient EA storage we will also be able to store the "large inode
fields" into EAs for existing filesystems.
Cheers, Andreas
