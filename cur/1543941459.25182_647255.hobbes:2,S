Thanks for your information.

Thank you for your attention, Andi.
Oh, what do I mean is "I/O xAPIC", but not the "local xAPIC" or xAPIC
interrupt architecture introduced by Intel Pentium4 CPU.   It seems
that the "I/O xAPIC" hasn't been well documented yet, but some other
document do have some description about it.  Some Intel guys gave me
an URL for the document:
http://download.intel.com/technology/computing/vptech/Intel
(r)_VT_for_Direct_IO.pdf
Section 5 and section 9.5 describe 'I/OxAPIC'. I'm not sure if it is
already supported by Linux, I guess it is not.
