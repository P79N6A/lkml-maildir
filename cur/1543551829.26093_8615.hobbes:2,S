Subject: fairly hard XFree86 related crash in 2.4.0-test8+

My main question is how do I go about debugging a problem which locks
up my system? (or at least the video card) I would like to be able to
get some more info so I can really tell you what is going on. Anyway
here is the problem:
I have had some crashes when using XFree86 4.0.1 and kernel
2.4.0-test8 and 2.4.0-test10-pre3 (I have not tried others). First of
all this is not a X server crash leaving me at the console. The X
server freezes leaving the video card in graphics mode. Some times
the kernel will respond to Alt-PrScr requests, but not always. Also I
cannot predict the crashes. They seem to happen at times of hi system
load but do not always happen when doing the same thing. Sometimes I'm
switching virtual desktops, sometimes I'm trying to load a page in
netscape.
The problem seems to have been worse in test8 but I'm not at all
sure. One thing that is sure is that it never happened in test1 at
all. That is at least somewhere to start. 
My system is: Pentium 133, Voodoo3 2000 PCI (using DRI/DRM for 3D),
64M RAM, Debian 2.2 (woody) and the XF86 4 phase2 debs.
As I said at the beginning: tell me what is the best way to debug this
kind of problem and I'll be glad to help. Thanks for all your time.

PS: I did not post this to the XFree86 list because since the problem
is kernel version dependent and not XFree version dependent so the
problem is almost surely in the kernel. But tell me if you think I
should post it there.
