Hmmm...  So your thought is that __rcu_offline_cpu() moves nxtlist and
curlist, but not donelist, but then returns to rcu_offline_cpu(), which
might well do the tasklet_kill_immediate() before the tasklet completed
processing all of donelist.
Seems plausible to me.  If true, your patch adding the following statement
to the ed of __rcu_offline_cpu seems like a reasonable fix:
	rcu_move_batch(this_rdp, rdp->donelist, rdp->donetail);
Vatsa, is there something that Oleg and I are missing?

Sounds good!
