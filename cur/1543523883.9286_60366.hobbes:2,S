It's really 1122 :)
MAH>             IP addresses are not permitted to have the value 0 or -1 for
MAH>             any of the <Host-number>, <Network-number>, or <Subnet-

MAH>             This implies that each of these fields will be at least two
MAH>             bits long.
MAH> I interpret the above as meaning that it is not legal to have a
MAH> network like this:
MAH> 192.168.0.0/24   or 23.0.0.0/24
MAH> with hosts 192.168.0.1 through 192.168.0.254 or with hosts
MAH> 23.0.0.1 through 23.0.0.254.
Why? 192.168.0.0 is a C class address, so it has the network number
192.168.0 which is not 0. As 23.0 is not equal to 0. So they are
allowed.
