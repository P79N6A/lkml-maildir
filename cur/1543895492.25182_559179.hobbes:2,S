I think the check in idle_balance needs to be modified.
If the domain *does not* have SD_BALANCE_NEWIDLE set then
next_balance must still be set right. Does this patch fix it?
Scheduler: Fix next_interval determination in idle_balance().
The intervals of domains that do not have SD_BALANCE_NEWIDLE must
be considered for the calculation of the time of the next balance. 
Otherwise we may defer rebalancing forever.
