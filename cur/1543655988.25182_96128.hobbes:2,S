I've also noticed that algorithms like the recursive one I run which
simulates solving the Tower of Hanoi problem are most likely very hard
to do branch prediction on.  Both the code and data no doubt fit
entirely in the L2 cache.  The AMD processor below is a much lower
cost and significantly lower clock rate (and on a machine with only a
100Mhz Memory bus) than the Xeon, yet dramatically outperforms it with
the same executable, compiled with gcc -march=i686 -O3.  Maybe with a
better Pentium 4 optimizing compiler the P4 and Xeon could improve a
few percent, but I doubt it'll ever see the AMD numbers.
