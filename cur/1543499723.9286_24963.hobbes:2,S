One client I contracted for last year did a lot of traffic, allow me; with kernel
2.0.x, ip accounting overflowed every thirty minutes on average.  We reduced logging
to a bare minimum and rotated several times a day and fiddled up a few little c
programs to handle the rollovers.  When you're forced to deal with industrial
strength issues, your research leads to several neat solutions.  After all...this is
Linux isn't it?  :)
