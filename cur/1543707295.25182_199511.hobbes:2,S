If the user never sees a name, it doesn't matter. However the user actually sees
and reads the filenames in /home, portable media, networks devices and lots of
places. However, when a user has named a component those characters are those
that are important to the user because those form an "image" (since you introduced
the term) or "sound" that the user remembers and associates with the content. A 
character is the simplest form of image so it should always look the same.
