I can't think of a case that doesn't fit my model. So, if you're
saying that it's simple, that's good.
          dev1      +----------+        dev2
           |        |  CPU /   |         |
   --------+--------+  BRIDGE  +---------+--------
           |        |  ---->   |         |
          mem1      +----------+        mem2
If for example, there are two PCI busses, and a memory controller on
both of them, but no DMA cpability in one direction through the PCI 
bridge (embedded CPU) then there should be two memory pools. 
In the picture above: dev1 can reach mem2, but dev2 can't reach mem1.
PCI devices on the restricted PCI bus (dev2) will have to pass a 
memory allocation descriptor that describes just the memory on 
that PCI bus,  the other one (dev1) can pass a descriptor that 
prefers the non-shared memory, (leaving as much as possible for 
the devices on the other bus (bus2)), but
reverts to the memory that the other devices can handle as well. 
But if we end up "reading" from dev1, and writing the same data
to dev2 we're better off DMAing it to "mem2". So, how to tell
the dev1 driver that allocing off the allocation descriptor 
"mem1, then mem2", is not a good a good idea, and that it should
use "mem2, then mem1" is a problem that remains to be solved... 
But if I'm missing a case that can't be modelled, please enlighten
me as to what I'm missing....
