Hmm.. That should be possible. I wanted to do the simplest possible code 
sequence, but yeah, I guess there's nothing wrong with allowing the code 
to dirty the page.
Somebody want to send me a proper patch? Also, I haven't actually heard 
from whoever actually noticed the problem in the first place (Robin?) 
whether the fix does fix it. It "obviously does", but testing is always 
good ;)
