Dear folks,
I use rsync to transfer my mail (including this list) from work to home
over ppp ussing OpenSSH 2.3.0.  I have no problem transfering  hundreds
of megabytes of my babies' photos from a non-raid partition (going to
work), but I get:
nsmail/Inbox
Write failed: Cannot allocate memory
unexpected EOF in read_timeout
about 19 times out of 20 (1 success so far)
Kernel: 2.4.0, no patches
PIII 450MHz, 256MB RAM, Acus P3B-F motherboard (Intel 440BX)
Mail going to Raid 1 device
The file Inbox is only 2.9MB
OS = Red Hat 7 with all updates, both home and work.
Same with ppp 2.3.x and ppp 2.4.0
Same whether work machine runs 2.2.16 or 2.4.0 kernel.
Any suggestions on where to begin to look for the problem?  I really
need my email.
