Perhaps Ulrich and Jakub should join this discussion, as the whole
thing sounds like a rehash of the userland ld.so + glibc versioned ABI.
glibc has weathered 64-bit LFS changes to open(), SYSENTER, and vdso.
Isn't this discussion entirely analogous (except for the patching of
performance critical sections, perhaps) to taking a binary compiled
against glibc-2.0 back on Linux-2.2 and running it on glibc-2.4 + 2.6.17?
Or OpenSolaris, for that matter?
