It isn't written down anywhere - this is one of the major problems here.
If you ask Linus, Linus will say "sure, it's fine to have binary-only
modules", but it's not explicitly documented in the license document
and as such everyone who contributes code to the kernel doesn't have
to agree to this.
Unfortunately, putting it into the license now could be construed as a
change of terms, which would require everyone whose code is exported via
EXPORT_SYMBOL to agree (and there's little chance of that happening...)
