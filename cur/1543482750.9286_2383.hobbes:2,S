Differences with `Kernelver':
o	I discovered and fixed some minutes ago the mmget/mmput race
	that was causing process in D state and many crazy Oops from procfs
	or filemap_nopage() in clean 2.2.0.
o	my latest VM with nr_freeable_pages balance. It should work very
	well on low memory and the system should run smoothly also under
	intensive swap operations.
o	My new update_shared_mappings() code. This will greatly improve
	performance while handling shared mmaped files from different contexts.
o	irq_state array is PII cache aligned (32byte to decrease bus traffic
	under intense irq activities in SMP)
o	getname buffer caching
o	dynamic buffer hash table size (big improvement for high memory
	machines, and saved memory for low memory machines)
o	final fix for the disable/enable_bh I fixed some weeks ago
	This patch fix also a possible not critical race in remove_bh(),
	btw note the wmb() to take care of SMP ;).
o	new IEEE1284 parport code from Tim Waugh. Incidentally this code
	broke with the new recursive semaphore (ask for details).
	Is in fix in progress state. Here works though, even if maybe a
	bit more crazy ;). If you want to be rock solid better that you
	don't use the printer with 2.2.0_arca-3 though...
o	get_wchan() moved in arch specific section and CTRL+SCROLL-LOCK
	use get_wchan() to get the PC filed information.
o	fixed page bound limits and the case of a new forked not
	scheduled yet process in get_wchan()
o	some still pending (not yet merged from Alan) jiffies wrap update
o	reimplemented hopefully completly wrap compliant time
	to jiffies/msec (and reverse) functions
o	little vmalloc fix + vmalloc SMP thread safety
o	bttv doesn't generate 50 irq per sec even if not used
o	some other thing
