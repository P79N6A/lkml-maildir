However it'd be done, it'd be an essential part, and it was missing.  In fact,
your getpages() didn't have a way to return the dma_addr_t values, and your
freepages() didn't provide it as an input.  (But it did pass mem_flags in, as
I had at some point suggested should be done with dma_alloc_coherent.)

I think the patch I posted "easily and safely" does that, appropriate for 2.5,
even though some platforms can't yet collect that win.
I'd agree that morphing drivers/pci/pool.c into drivers/base/pool.c (or whatever)
would be appropriate, but I haven't heard any arguments to justify using that
allocator on systems where the the slab code can be used (more cheaply).
