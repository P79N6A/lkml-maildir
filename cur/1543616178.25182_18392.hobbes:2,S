It only has to wait if locks are held and then only until the locks are
dropped.  Otherwise it will preempt on the next return from interrupt.
Future work would be to look into long-held locks and see what we can
do.
Without preempt-kernel, we have none of this: either run until
completion or explicit scheduling points.
