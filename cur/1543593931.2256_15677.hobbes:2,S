Nah, just a misconception (NB: the whole scc driver initialization is crap
anyway -- but that part was written before we even had procfs; the next 
version will use procfs, but I'm not quite convinced that my current 
approach for the rewrite is correct. Fact is that the driver has to support 
far too many different parameters). The next version will also use
the ISR of your z85230 HDLC driver, the z8530 seems to occasionally 
overwrite it's interrupt vector register with new status information
before the old one was read.

They won't assign IRQs above 15 for ISA cards, will they?
I gravely hope that nobody gets the idea to design a PCI card
for the Z8530 without bus master DMA...
>or non x86
Granted. But I've no reports that anyone actually tried that,
especially as the (unmodified) driver is only useful for packet radio
purposes.
>Both fixed
How? ;-)
