There is a known bug in the visor driver that can happen when the visor
is done syncing and then disconnects, while the pilot-link connection
(which is what jpilot uses) is still open.  Can you load the visor
driver with "debug=1" and see if this oops still happens (and if so, can
you send me the kernel debug log?)
