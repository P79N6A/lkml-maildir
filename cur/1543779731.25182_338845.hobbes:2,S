Go tell the dimwits not trimming their posts to control themselves, 
I'm generating minimal traffic with this project.  Certainly far 
less traffic then that imbecile arguing for _his_ default setting.

Starting somewhere, I'll settle :)  It is this feedback I need at 
start -- sorts of things to exclude.  I'll not get any feedback 
without reporting stuff to the list.

I looked at that AmlCode error source file and grepping for a match 
failed for entire source tree, so did not understand it.

Killfile me.  I'm posting far less noise to lkml per month than 
your daily line count of repetitive, non-informational space 
wasting dot_sig.
Thanks,
