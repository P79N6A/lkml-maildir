Yes, there should be page->flags to indicate hard and soft memory errors,
such as PG_hard_error and PG_soft_error.  The dump code could look at those 
flags.
include/linux/page-flags.h has PG_error for indicating I/O errors, which 
is close but not quite what we need, given the way it is used.  
CCing linux-kernel since the flags are not ia64 specific.
