Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Version 9 (2.6.24-rc1) Smack: Simplified Mandatory Access Control Kernel
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/24/676

The Smack patch and Paul Moore's netlabel API patch,
together for 2.6.24-rc1. Paul's changes are identical
to the previous posting, but it's been a while so they're
here again.
The sole intent of change has been to address locking
and/or list processing issues. Please don't hesitate to
point out any problems that you might see or suggest
alternatives where things might not be to your liking.
This version is aimed at 2.6.24, and has been tested
against 2.6.24-rc1.
Thank you again.
