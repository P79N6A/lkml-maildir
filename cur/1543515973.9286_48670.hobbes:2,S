OK, I _really need_ USB SCSI.  I have lost all access to Linux at
work.  My only hope of not being bannished to MS-Windows is USB
SCSI.  Without USB SCSI mass storage working, I only have tiny-term to 
our AIX box.  There are about 5 guys waiting on me to bring in a USB hard disk
with Linux installed.

If you could take a half hour to an hour and explain what USB SCSI was 
doing, doing wrong, and should do I would be most appreciative.  I am
a fairly competent C programmer, but a novice kernel hacker.  I have
time allocated (an indefinite amount until the usb hard disk is
working) towards this.  I have been experimenting with usb scsi, but
am really just gropping around.

Does this mean that the SCSI code _can't_ be fixed until the procfs
code is fixed or that you two can't do both at the same time?  I'm
begging you, tell me how to help!

Did I mention that I have a USB hard disk? LaCie 10GB.
