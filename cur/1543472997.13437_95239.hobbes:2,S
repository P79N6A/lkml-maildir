Hi!
I resently resized my root partition with partitionmagic, which was
obviously a mistake. It reported success but afterwards e2fsck
reported hundreds of errors on that partition, bad/duplicate blocks
mostly. I now have ~3000 files in lost+found, presumably the new
inodes  created from enlarging the partition since they are all in the
upper range, 1.4-1.5 million (the partition is ~6 gig). Fsck reports
the same bad/duplicate block errors each time run and doesn't fix
it. The errors concern the files in /lost+found, all files previously
on the partition seems intact since my system is up and running fine.
I think there is no hardware error involved as this is a disk that has
held my root partition without problems for almost a year. The kernel
is 2.1.132.
The files look like

etc. 
There are a few directories and when trying to remove them I get a
kernel panic about directories with holes in them. The files listed
above are also unremvoable (Operation not permitted/File to large).
If I have left out important information, tell me. How do I go about
getting rid of these files. I have done a chattr -i * in /lost+found
but since mose of the files are special that didn't fo any good.
