I think that the point was, that switching from userspace to kernelspace 
then to userspace again and back to kernelspace in order to do something, 
that could have been done directly in the userspace, and though could save 
those two unnecessary switches, is an unnecessary overhead, which may not 
necessarily be that insignificant if it's done so often (which for 
streaming audio is the case). Why doing things complicated when there is 
no evident gain from it, or is there?
