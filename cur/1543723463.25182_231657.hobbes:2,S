On a multi-user machine this may result in undesirable behaviour, since 
each thread seems to compete for resources and the machine may get VERY 
slow if someone deos something anti-social. There is a Mandelbrot 
drawing program which allows use of threads, it will do very bad things 
to system performance to have 8 CPU bound threads generating graphics so 
X is doing a lot of work as well. Student claimed it was part of his 
math homework...
