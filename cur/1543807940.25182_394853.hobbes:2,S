Yeah, I've been flip-flopping on CONFIG_SMP.  I just don't have strong
opinion one way or the other. Having said that, I don't think we should
mix the CONFIG_IA64_GENERIC, which is defined to select platform type
with smp/processor type etc.
But for the bit that this thread started, which disables CONFIG_MCKINLEY
for CONFIG_IA64_GENERIC, it is totally wrong and is the "over my dead
body" type of thing.
