I'm on thin ice here, but I think the error is caused by programs trying
to access a long that is not aligned on a /8 memory-adress. I believe
the kernel automagicly avoids the problem some how - and that the
messages are just warnings telling you you should fix the program.
Anyways - we had lots of unaligned trap messages on our Alpha-linux
(from all kinds of programs), and it didn't cause any problems.
However, we have had the "wrong byte #8" problem on several machines,
running different kernel-versions(2.2.5 and 2.2.9), with different
network-cards (3com 509, 3com 905 and Intel) in different locations. 
The only common factor is that they are all running linux. 
According to some documentation "wrong byte #8" is hardware problem in
network card, switch or something. However, I find that highly
improbably in our case because it happens lots of different machines
(and in different nets).
Once in a while all network activity stops, and if we try ping we get
the "wrong byte #8" on all packets. The problem remains for a long time,
unless we do (ifconfig eth0 down; ifconfig eth0 up) - then the problem
stops. Tis leads me to believe the problem is software related.
My hunch is that some hardware problem cause the linux-kernel to get in
the wrong "state", so that the problem remains until the interface is
taken down and up again. 
Does anyone have suggestions for debugging I can do?
