Subject: Strange virtual/physical address of global data

I wrote a little module to test virt_to_phys:
unsigned long test_data;
int init_module(void)
{
    void *virt = &test_data;
    unsigned long phys = virt_to_phys(virt);
When I run this and check the valur of virt and phys, it appears that phys is
outside the range of physical memory!  That is, if I have 512MB of RAM, then
phys is equal to about 520M.  However, if I make test_data a local variable:
int init_module(void)
{
    unsigned long test_data;
    void *virt = &test_data;
    unsigned long phys = virt_to_phys(virt);
Then I get a number which makes sense (less than 512M)
Could someone explain this to me?
