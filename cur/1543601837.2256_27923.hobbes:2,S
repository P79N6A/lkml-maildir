I think that's very harsh, because while the kernel can't predict the
future, in many cases the sysadmin can, and some of the tools used to act
on that information are not gone due to "enhancement." Most particularly,
the free pages are now not settable, leaving the admin to diddle with
*unrelated* things trying to get correct function, instead of setting the
free required and letting the kernel do a balance between buffes, cache,
etc. So if I know I have an application which will need 12MB suddenly to
maintain good response, I have lost my tool to just tell the system that
much free is needed. And honestly the fact that the kernel makes good
overall choices pales when the worst case is to blatently bad.

It reflects poor decisions in the kernel. To balance program and i/o pages
the kernel should track the i/o rate while increasing the cache used. When
the i/o rate stops getting better, the kernel should assume that the
program is not reusing the data pages at this time. Obviously this need
hysterisis to keep the program vs. data ratio from changing too fast after
some good initial setting, but having a file copy or CD rip push programs
out of memory shows that the kernel is not making optimal use of the
information it has.

Sorry, I think the problem is that the existing logic is just not working.
When you trade a small gain in overall performance for a really bad worst
case you are balancing a gain which is measured rather than felt with a
loss which is instantly painful.
Please rethink, the use-once is elegant, but it just doesn't work, and
until the kernel makes some effort to avoid paging out text for data when
it doesn't help performance you will have these ugly pauses. I will note
that we were doing just this type of balance of space in 1968 in GECOS (as
in the arcane GECOS password field).
Hopefully you will find this criticism constructive...
