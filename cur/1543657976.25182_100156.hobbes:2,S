I'm sorry. Really.
But I reverted the whole patchset and then applied again:
patching file drivers/char/agp/frontend.c
patch: **** unexpected end of file in patch
I guess I somehow missed it the first time I applied it.
I'm dowloading again the patch...
There was a problem with the patch on kernel.org or is 
_totaly_ my fault ? I guess the latter...
Ciao,
          Paolo
