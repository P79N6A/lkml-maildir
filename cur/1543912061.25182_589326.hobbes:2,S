Hello everyone,
i am trying to run linux on realview_eb_mpcore.
I read some articles about how to port linux and uboot to a new board,
according to the article, when I am porting the uboot, i should modify
a file called lowlevel_init.c , which is in the fold
board/realview_eb. this file describes the memory partition of the
board. but in the realview_eb , this file doesn't do this job.
anyone can tell me , where is it done?
without doing this, the file system can be booted or not?
any comments are appreciated.
regards,
yang
