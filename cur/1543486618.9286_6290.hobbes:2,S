Hello everybody,
I'm trying to find my way through 2.2.1 kernel sources. As i am _very_ 
far of being a hardware expert i have a question about about freeing
IRQs in 2.2.1. AFAIG each PIC is described by a "struct hw_interrupt_type", 
e.g. the 8259 by "i8259A_irq_type". And whenever a driver frees an IRQ
and there's nobody else having interest in this IRQ (no hooked
"irqaction"s) we just mark it as IRQ_DISABLED and we call the PIC
specific "shutdown" for this IRQ to disable this IRQ in the future.
Can somebody ACK if this is right ?
Many thanks in advance,
Florian.
