AIX implements something akin to this. When memory is running low, it
sends SIGDANGER to all processes. Those who doesn't trap it, dies. Those
who trap it can shut down gracefully or, if they are important daemons,
stay alive.
I suggest we make some research on how they have implemented it. It might
be the best solution. The only drawback is that we need all important
userspace programs (the ones that must survive or shut down properly) to
trap SIGDANGER. But this is an issue for v2.5 anyway, so...
