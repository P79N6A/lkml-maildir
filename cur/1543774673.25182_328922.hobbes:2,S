Did all the 64CPUs write to the same file?
Then update_atime was just the messenger - it is the first function
to read the inode so it eats the cache miss overhead.
Maybe adding a prefetch for it at the beginning of sys_read() 
might help, but then with 64CPUs writing to parts of the inode
it will always thrash no matter how many prefetches.
