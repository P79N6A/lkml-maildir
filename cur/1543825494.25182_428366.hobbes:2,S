Looks like one of the magic numbers ("0xfee1dead", "0xfeedbeef", 
0xfeedface"), but that's not it.

No, d_splice_alias() is a different kind of splicing: it splices a dentry 
entry into the alias list. Nothing to do with the new splice() system 
call, except that the naming comes from the same english word ("splice: to 
join two ropes by interweaving strands").
I don't see anything suspicious anywhere, and this doesn't ring a bell. 
It is probably a good idea to open a bugzilla entry on it, so that it 
doesn't get lost. And perhaps cc the reiserfs people (there's been a few 
reiserfs changes since 2.6.16, but none of them looks suspicious to me: 
however, maybe this makes somebody else go "Aaah!").
Try Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>, Jeff Mahoney <jeffm@suse.com> and 
Alexander Zarochentzev <zam@namesys.com>.
