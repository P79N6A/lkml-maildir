   Which of the following is more readable:
   
   /* try atomic lock inline, if that fails, spin out of line */
   	"\tbtsl $1,%0\n"
It's only gross because you decided to make it so, try:
   	"btsl $1,%0\n\t"
Which is what I use just about everywhere now and I'm prefectly
fine with it.
Franks a lot,
