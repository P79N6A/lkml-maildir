I have one machine for testing which is running X, and a kexec reboot
glitches the video system when initiated from runlevel 5.  Kexec works fine
from runlevel 3.
I was not able to test this until now, due to the "crash on leaving X"
bug which has been fixed in 2.5.69.
The symptoms are a blank screen for the 35 seconds that it takes this
box to do a kexec boot following do-kexec.sh /boot/vmlinuz-2.5.69-mm1
Then, if I had "id:3:initdefault:" in /etc/inittab, I just get a blank screen
at the console, but I can ssh into the box since it does come up fine otherwise.
If I had runlevel 5 instead in the above, then X starts OK (after a blank screen
startup) and all is well.
