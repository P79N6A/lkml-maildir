Perhaps, I'm not getting the latest patch?  It skipped measuring because
migration cost array is non-zero (initialized to -1LL):
        [00]    [01]    [02]    [03]
[00]:     -     0.0(0)  0.0(0)  0.0(0)
[01]:   0.0(0)    -     0.0(0)  0.0(0)
[02]:   0.0(0)  0.0(0)    -     0.0(0)
[03]:   0.0(0)  0.0(0)  0.0(0)    -
--------------------------------
| cacheflush times [1]: 0.0 (-1)
| calibration delay: 0 seconds
--------------------------------
Need this change?  I bet you had that in your tree already.

Also, the cost calculation in measure_one() looks fishy to me in this version.

Typo here ??
