Hey Robert,
Thanks for the names. Between the list, private replies, and creative
googling, the list is down to 14 addresses:
antoine hat ausone.whoknows
dmitri hat users.sourceforge.net
jackson hat realtek.com.tw
kafai0928 hat yahoo.com
linux-m68k.org hat mandrakesoft.com
patch hat luckynet.dynu.com
redbliss hat libero.it
rfjak hat eircom.net
rgcrettol hat datacomm.ch
sam hat minnie.(none)
sawa hat yamamoto.gr.jp
suse.cz hat mastika.lnxw.com
taral hat taral.net
thchou hat ali.com.tw
I suspect at least 6 or 7 of those are actual people or organizations who
wouldn't mind being found.
Be well,
Zack
