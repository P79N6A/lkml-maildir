that's fair enough. I don't see the need for the macro abstractions
though; a current->pid and current->user_pid (or visible_pid or any
other good name) split makes sense. no need for macro abstractions at
all, just add ->user_pid in patch 1, in patch 2 assign it default to
->pid as well and patch 3 converts the places where ->pid is now given
to userspace ;)
again the DRM layer needs an audit, I'm not entirely sure if it doesn't
get pids from userspace. THe rest of the kernel mostly ought to cope
just fine.
