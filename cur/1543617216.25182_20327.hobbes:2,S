You don't know that.  Maybe she installed it herself.

*You can't know that.*  
And your belief that you *can* know it is a key part of the elitist
developer psychology and implicit assumptions that keeps Linux mostly
inaccessible to the Aunt Tillies of the world.

According to the National Crime Survey administered by the Bureau of
the Census and the National Institute of Justice, it was found that
only 12 percent of those who use a gun to resist assault are injured,
as are 17 percent of those who use a gun to resist robbery. These
percentages are 27 and 25 percent, respectively, if they passively
comply with the felon's demands. Three times as many were injured if
they used other means of resistance.
