It does not matter - even with threads cost of having thousands of
threads is _too_ expensive. So, IMO, it is wrong to have to create 
20k threads for the simple web server which only sends one index page to
80k connections with 4k connections per seconds rate.
Just have that example in mind - more than 20k blocks in 80k connections 
over gigabit lan, and it is likely optimistic result, when designing new 
type of AIO.
