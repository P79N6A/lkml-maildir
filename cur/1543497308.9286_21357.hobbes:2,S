I am experiencing this problem in all 2.2 series kernel
and even in 2.3.2 kernel too.
i.e my system date is wrong after system wakeup from apm suspend.
Before apm suspend, time is 12.05 am (GMT +8 zone), if I wake-up
the system within few minutes date shows correct time, but if I
wake-up after  more-than 30 minutes, system time goes back to
20:40 approximately. 
Could anyone explain me what is going wrong?
I am not storing the time in cmos in GMT format.
I tried GMT+0 format but still the problem shows-up.
Date & time are not sync using any time server, just a
standalone PC.
Thank you in advance
Brdgs
