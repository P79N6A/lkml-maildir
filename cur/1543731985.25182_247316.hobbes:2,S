ok, I gues I might try without a netfilter, I've also seen similiar
messages about kjournald allocation, but next line would say stack
pointer is garbage, not printing. Would it be some leftover after
netfilter problems during the run or should I try to reproduce that
behaviour and wait for some meaningful output ?
