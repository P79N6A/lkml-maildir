Building a mirror may be just moving data around. But the interesting
issues in raid1 are more about maintaining a mirror:  read balancing,
retry on error, hot spares, etc.

But is this something that you would *want* to do???
To my mind, the raid1/raid5 almost always lives below any LVM or
partitioning scheme.  You use raid1/raid5 to combine drives (real,
physical drives) into virtual drives that are more reliable, and then
you partition them or whatever you want to do.  raid1 and raid5 on top
of LVM bits just doesn't make sense to me.
I say 'almost' above because there is one situation where something
else makes sense.  That is when you have a small number of drives in a
machine (3 to 5) and you really want RAID5 for all of these, but
booting only really works for RAID1.  So you partition the drives, use
RAID1 for the first partitions, and RAID5 for the rest.
put boot (or maybe root) on the RAID1 bit and all your interesting data
on the RAID5 bit.
[[ I just had this really sick idea of creating a raid level that did
data duplication (aka mirroring) for the first N stripes, and
stripe/parity (aka raid5) for the remaining stripes.  Then you just
combine your set of drives together with this level, and depending on
your choice of N, you get all raid1, all raid5, or a mixture which
allows booting off the early sectors....]]

I would probably need a more concrete proposal before I had something
to agree with :-)
I really think the raid1/raid5 parts of MD are distinctly different
from DM, and they should remain separate.  However I am quite happy to
improve the interfaces so that seamless connections can be presented
by user-space tools.
For example,  md currently gets its 'super-block' information by
reading the device directly.  Soon it will have two separate routines
that get the super-block info, one for each super-block format.  I
would be quite happy for there to be a way for DM to give a device to
MD along with some routine that provided super-block info by getting
it out of some near-by LVM superblock rather than out of the device
itself.
Similarly, if an API could be designed for MD to provide higher levels
with access to the spare parts of it's superblock, e.g. for partition
table information, then that might make sense.
To summarise:  If you want tigher integration between MD and DM, do it
by defining useful interfaces, not by trying to tie them both together
into one big lump.
