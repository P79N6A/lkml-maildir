In suspend2, it's in arch/i386/power/suspend2.c, involved via code near
the start of kernel/power/process.c. The bulk of it is not in assembly,
and doesn't need to be. If you get the latest version from
softwaresuspend.berlios.de, you'll see that I've separated the secondary
processors support out and tidied it a bit. It works perfectly for me.

I'll try to start producing patches asap. (Within the constraints I have
by having a real job as well :>).
