Thanks for the response.  However, apart from Ralph, Paul and yourself,
it seems none of the other architecture maintainers care about this
patch - the original mail was BCC'd to the architecture list.  Maybe
that's an implicit acceptance of this patch, I don't know.
I do know that page_to_pfn() will generate code on some platforms which
don't require it due to them declaring flush_cache_page() as a function.
However, I assert that if they don't need this overhead, that's for them
to fix up.  I don't know all their quirks so it isn't something I can
tackle.
In other words, unless I actually receive some real help from the other
architecture maintainers on this to address your concerns, ARM version 6
CPUs with aliasing L1 caches (== >16K) will remain a dead dodo with
mainline Linux kernels.
(This mail BCC'd to the architecture list again in the vain hope that
someone will offer assistance.)
