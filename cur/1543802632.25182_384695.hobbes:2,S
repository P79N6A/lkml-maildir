I believe the accounting our customers require needs to be turned on
system-wide.  In fact, I recall getting problems reports if there are
some processes not 'accounted' for.  If you do it on a task basis,
and accounting gets turned on, you'd have to have a fool-proof way
of tracking down all the tasks in a system and turn on their accounting.
I would expect sites either want accounting on all the time for
everything, or not at all.
