The big question is : are containers/RG allowed to use *upto* their
limit always? In other words, will you typically setup limits such that
sum of all limits = max resource capacity? 
If it is setup like that, then what you are considering as limit is
actually guar no?
If it wont be setup like that, then I dont see how one can provide QoS.
