The requirements are comes from Network Equipment Providers, Telecom 
Carriers, and Hardware Vendors,
You can see the attendee from below link;

GDB based approach seems not fit to our requirements. GDB(ptrace) based 
functions are basically need to be done when target process is stopping.
In addition to that current PTRACE_PEEK/POKE* allows us to copy only a 
*word* size...
 From our experience, sometimes patches became to dozens to hundreds at 
one patching, and in this case GDB based approach cause target process's 
availability descent.
