Well, it is obvious an "are we in a sleep-ok state?" query that works in any
case is desired by a lot of code.
I certainly don't want to punt every thinkpad LED write to a workqueue,
because that would mean less time with the CPU in C3 in the bottom line,
even if there are some benefits to always doing it the workqueue way (the
workqueue helper colapses attempts to change the LED state too often).
Can we add "in_scheduleable()", or maybe "can_schedule()", that returns
in_atomic() if CONFIG_PREEMT, or 0 if there is no way to know?   To my
limited knowledge of how that part of the kernel works, it would do the
right thing.
