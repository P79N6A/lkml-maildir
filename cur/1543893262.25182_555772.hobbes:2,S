Btw, to extend a bit on this: there actually *is* a "list with a head" 
implementation in <linux/list.h>, called "hlist".
Now, the "h" actually historically stands for "hash", but if you prefer, 
you can think of it as standing for "head", and be happy.
And if you want a head, you really do want to use "hlist", since the head 
is smaller than a list entry (a single pointer rather than two).
And yes, I'm sure we could change some "struct list" users to "struct 
hlist" if you wanted to.
