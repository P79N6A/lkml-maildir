Ah and then there is the heart attack inducing 
trick we played on a new systems programmer back
in the days of RSX-11m. I think we created a couple
exectable scripts such that he ran one and it appeared
to do the RSX equivalent of rm -rf *, ie pip *.*;*/DE
except that we had also substituted pip in his 
search path so it actually moved all his work safely
(and quietly) elsewhere first....
Hey, so now you know what a real BOFH was like as a 
kid :-)
