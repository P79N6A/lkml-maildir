Previously we had a popf which for the CPU unpredictable
restoring of most of its state. I would assume the unpredicted jump
is cheaper than that.
I might be wrong. Benchmarks will tell when I try it.
But I think it might be worth a try at least.

I meant they don't care about any other flags. Of course you need
a test + conditional jump first to handle the nested lock case.

I bet near all cases where restore_flags() are used to restore something
else than IF are actually bugs or performance issues of some sort
This doesn't include the context switch of course, but that one 
doesn't use restore_flags().
(I think I have a few legitimate cases of save_flags though. They probably
should be using a different macro for clarity.)
