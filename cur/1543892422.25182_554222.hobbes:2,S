Just as a side note: I think retaining code to do byte-by-byte access
also is worth it, such as:
+ #ifdef UNALIGNED_OK
+		if (get_unaligned((const unsigned short *)m_pos) ==
+				get_unaligned((const unsigned short *)ip)) {
+#else
+		if (m_pos[0] != ip[0] || m_pos[1] != ip[1]) {
+#endif
Since on archs where unaligned access is slower than byte-by-byte
access (e.g. where unaligned access dirty work is done in s/w), we do
not want to use get_unaligned() - instead simply byte-by-byte access
is better.
