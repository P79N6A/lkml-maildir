Umm... In the final variant of patch all interaction is done by
alloc_vfsmnt() and set_devname() on one side and kill_super(),
do_kern_mount() and do_remount_sb() on another. That is, aside
of the currently public functions (actually, some of them are
gone - kern_umount is #defined to mntput and kern_mount became
a trivial inlined wrapper around do_kern_mount, change_root is
gone, etc.).
In my variant it was called fs/namespace.c, basically since I prefer
the names along the line "what does it deal with" (answer: user-visible
namespace) to "what action is done here" ones, especially since mount(2)
is not the only syscall exported (pivot_root(2) and umount(2) are also
handled here).
After all, inode.c, dcache.c, buffer.c, locks.c, devices.c, etc. are named
that way. OTOH, open.c and namei.c are not, so... Up to you - my preference
would be a noun and namespace looks better than next contender (mntcache),
but that's your call - filenames in core kernel...
