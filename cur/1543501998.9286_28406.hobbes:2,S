Subject: 2.2.10ac7: How to make NFS server work?

Hi
In vanilla 2.2.x I used user space server rpc.nfsd/rpc.mound as packaged
by Red Hat 6.0.
In 2.2.10ac7 rpc.nfsd doesn't load, it says: nfssvc function is not
implemented.
I failed also to make the kernel nfsd work.
I do not like to revert to vanilla 2.2.10 because of better APM in
ac5-7.
What to do?
Thank you in advance
Alexander
