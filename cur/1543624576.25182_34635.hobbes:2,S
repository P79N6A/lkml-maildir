As you may have gathered from my last email, this is a bit annoying when 
trying to find and stabalize a driver for a card you just got :)

Does that mean orinoco updates are coming for 2.5.x?
Any idea if the other drivers are getting updates too, like airo?

My standard rule of thumb is turning out to be, deploy something 
2.4.x-worthy in 2.5.x, wait a while, and then deploy it in 2.4.x.  I 
have no particular opinion about whether your patch should go in -right 
now- but it seems like a fair patch for 2.4.x sooner or later.
