Two good solutions come to mind:
a. substitute the zero page
b. make the mapping private and touch it as if C-O-W happened
Other concerns:
Optionally excluding the current UID/TGID/TID would be good.
(some flags) A revokeat() call seems to be required. Be sure
to handle working directories. The controlling tty is special.
Flag processes with revoked ttys in /proc/*/stat please, so
that ps can report it properly without opening another file.
BTW, it is wonderful to see this happening.
