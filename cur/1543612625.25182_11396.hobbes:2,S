No it's much better to just have one machine running one instance of
the OS so that it can't get out of sync with itself.

No, I want my password file management to be in a one file for the whole
machine. Where it is now. Without requiring syncronisation. If we put the 
complexity in the kernel to make the system scale running one OS we 
don't have the problem that you're creating at all.

If you don't chop the OS up into multiple instances, you don't have these
problems. If you create the problems, I expect you to solve them. 
You're not making the system as a whole scale, you're just pushing the
problems out somewhere else.
