O.K, looks like you are agreeing that we need a buffering mechanism in 
the kernel to implement speculative tracing, right. Once we have the 
buffering mechanism we need to create an efficient API for producers of 
the data to write to that buffering scheme. To my knowledge there is no 
such generic buffering mechanism already in the kernel, Relayfs 
implements that buffering scheme and an efficient API to write to it.  
Isn't that a good reason to have Relayfs merged?
Once the data in the buffer is decided to be committed you need a 
mechanism to get that data from the kernel to userspace. If you don't 
like Relayfs transfer mechanism, what do you suggest using?
