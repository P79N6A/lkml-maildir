Unlikely - if you mean just resetting one PCI device, it's likely 
electrically impossible on many, if not most machines as the RST lines 
will be tied together on all slots.
The BIOS might possibly have the ability to issue a PCI bus reset 
independent of resetting the CPU, chipset, etc. but I don't think 
there's any standardized way to trigger this, even so.
In any case, I don't think - or at least would hope - that a PCI device 
going so far into the weeds that it can't be recovered without a RST 
would be a rare situation.
