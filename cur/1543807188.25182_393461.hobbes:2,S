Solving all the load balancing issues that occur under all-pinned case is
tricy... For example, even with this patch, at a particular sched domain,
load balance might still be disabled for the cpus which belong to the same 
sched group as the all-pinned "busiest CPU"

A simple change to find_busiest_queue() can avoid that addition to the
runqueue struct.
