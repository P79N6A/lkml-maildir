I've just noticed that the priority and nice values listed in
/proc/<pid>/stat aren't very useful for SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR tasks.
I'd like to be able to distinguish tasks with these policies from
SCHED_OTHER tasks, and to view task->rt_priority.
Am I correct that this information is not currently available through
/proc?
Here is one way to expose this information that should be compatible
with existing tools like top and ps.  For SCHED_OTHER, the values are
unchanged.  For SCHED_RR and SCHED_FIFO, the priority value displayed is
(20 + task->rt_priority), which distinguishes them for SCHED_OTHER
priorities which can't be greater than 20.  And SCHED_FIFO tasks, whose
nice value is ignored by the scheduler, are distinguished from SCHED_RR
tasks by begin displayed with a nice value of -99.

Can anyone think of a better way of doing this?
