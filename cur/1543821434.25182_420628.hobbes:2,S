Then we're back to the discussion on why RDMA is a fundamentally flawed
approach, but we already knew that.  The usual workaround is to only
allow RDMA operations to registered memory windows for which we can use
the normal dma operation.  There's also the *dac* pci dma operations that
can avoid iommu overhead if you support 64bit addressing.  But for all this
to work dma mapping fundamentally needs to be handled by the low level driver.
