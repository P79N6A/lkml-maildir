I didn't realize there was change afoot in this area, sorry.
I was just striving for consistency with current practice.
If Andrew suggested to use weak, that's fine, but it's kind
of erroneous for something like lib/string.c because that
gets built into a library lib.a file, which resolves any
unresolved references.
When the kernel is linked, lib.a implementations only get brought in
if they are not already resolved by definitions present in the other
objects of the kernel image.
Weak makes more sense when dealing with object files, not archives.
