No, both the new cables I put in and my old ones were 18" cables.

Perhaps I have not explained myself clearly enough, or perhaps my
understanding of what Andre's 2.2.x IDE patch is, is incorrect.
I am not using stock 2.2.  I am using 2.2 plus Andre Hedrick's IDE
backport patch.  I thought that the whole point of this patch was to
backport the enhanced IDE functionality from 2.4 back to 2.2.
Without Andre's patch, I wouldn't be able to send you the output of
/proc/ide/pdc202xx, because it wouldn't exist, because (as you point
out) there would be no code in the kernel specific to that chipset.
With the patch, there *is* code in the kernel specific to that
chipset.

This is all Greek to me.  Could you translate a bit for the
kernel-internals-impaired?  What should I be looking at/for, exactly?

But the settings are the same as those used by 2.2.19+IDE, with which
I'm not having any problems.  Here's /proc/ide/pdc202xx when I'm
running 2.2.19+IDE:
                                PDC20262 Chipset.
