My machine running 2.2.12 (RH 6.1) for about 23 days (coincidentally about
32768 minutes...) just stopped.  At the time I left the machine I was
running nothing and came back about 30 minutes later to a non-responnsive
computer.  The monitor was in power saving mode.  I could not wake it up.
Pinging was also fruitless.  I didn't get any corruption on the disk
and do not suspect a hardware problem.  The machine is a 2-way pentium MMX
166.  Has anyone else had a similar problem?  Any suggestions to prevent
this again?
