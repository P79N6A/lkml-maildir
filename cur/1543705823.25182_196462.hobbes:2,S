So the drive ought to report media changed if it knowingly over wrote
the table of contents, for instance.
I still think this is to be expected when mucking in undefined teritory.
Reload the media, it's not hard... Sure you can get around this with
snooping if you really wanted to, but IMO it's wasted effort. Add -eject
to cdrecord command line of default config, how you want so solve it is
not my problem.
