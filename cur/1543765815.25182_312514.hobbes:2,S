Hi. The promise wasn't made to me, but I'm hoping you will find a nice
and clean solution:
  Every so often there is bug in the kernel, by patching the
  syscall-table I have been able to fix bugs in ioperm and fsync without
  rebooting the box. 
  What do I do the next time I need to do something like this?
