I got this answer from Andrew, maybe he also picked up the patch
from cpufreq list?:
____________
This generates 100% rejects against the current cpufreq tree.  I'd suggest
that you prepare patches against latest -mm, which includes
git-cpufreq.patch.
Please also include the required Signed-off-by: tags, as per section 11 of
Documentation/SubmittingPatches.
____________
The patch needs a (!policy->cur) check for some cpufreq drivers, shall I resend
the whole patch with this one added or is the "ontop" patch I answered to 
avuton@gmail.com (Subject: Re: [PATCH 2/2] Re: 2.6.16-rc1-mm4) enough?
