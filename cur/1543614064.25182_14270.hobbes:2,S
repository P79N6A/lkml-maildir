Hello Dave,
In light of some of the earlier comments in the various threads, I'd like to
start feeding postings from linux-mm and linux-aio back into linux-kernel 
to encourage more widespread distribution of highly specific mumblings to the 
community at large.  Along this lines, I also would like a couple of more 
specific mailing lists to be added: linux-kernel-core and linux-kernel-bugs 
to help readers in classifying the traffic.  Thoughts?
