Well ttyS0 is connected to the rest of the machine using a UART.
This means that you can't control TxD directly. I suggest that
you use the parallel printer-port. This port allows you to set
individual bits and they remain <forever> in the last state set.
An ordinary (old-fashioned) printer-port allows you to set or
reset 8 data bits plus three control bits. The newer ones allow
you to read and write up to 16 bits.
Now, if you really need the +/- 12 volts that you think you
will get out of a UART, please measure it first. Many new computers
use I/O chips that only provide +/- 5 volts! Anyway, you can use the
modem-control bits if you need that kind of voltage swing. You can
set/reset modem control bits using the TIOCMGET/TIOCMSET ioctl()
calls. You probably want to disable the SIGHUP signal before
you muck with those bits. Some versions of Linux will send the
hangup signal to the TTY owner even though it's not the controlling
terminal for the process. This could cause your program to exit
for "unknown" reasons; signal(SIGHUP, SIG_IGN) prevents such problems.
