It seems to be the hardware. The machine has rebooted with both older 
Xorg and kernels back to 2.6.14 so the software that worked doesn't work 
anymore. Additionally it has rebooted with just rtorrent+lynx with no 
console activity at all, and other new situations, so it really looks 
it's the hardware (probably the capacitors).
