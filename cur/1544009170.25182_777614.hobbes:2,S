Changes to individual pages
---------------------------
accept.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify details when returned address is truncated
            If the returned address is truncated, the 'addrlen' argument
            indicates the actual size of the address, rather than a count
            of the number of bytes in the truncated buffer.
            Also clarify that if 'addr' argument is NULL, then 'addrlen'
            should is unused, and should also be NULL.
mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Loosen language around how 'addr' hint is interpreted
            Mel Gorman reported that in Linux 2.6.27, 'addr' is rounded
            down to a page boundary.
            Before kernel 2.6.26, if 'addr' was taken as a hint, it was
            rounded up to the next page boundary.  Since Linux 2.6.24,
            it is rounded down.  Therefore, loosen the description of
            this point to say that the address is rounded to "a nearby
            page boundary".
recv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify details when returned address is truncated
            If the recvfrom() returned address is truncated, the 'fromlen'
            argument indicates the actual size of the address, rather than
            a count of the number of bytes in the truncated buffer.
            Also clarify that the 'from' argument can be NULL, in which
            case 'fromlen' should is unused, and should also be NULL.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Internet datagram and netlink sockets support MSG_TRUNC for recv(2)
            Internet datagram (since Linux 2.4.27/2.6.8),
            and netlink (since Linux 2.6.22) sockets support
            the MSG_TRUNC flag for recv(2).
tcp.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that MSG_PEEK can be used on out-of-band data
