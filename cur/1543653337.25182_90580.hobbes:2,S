I know.

"The distributed lock"? Are you talking about scsi-level locks?
No, there is no link between the locks on the lower levels and NFS.

Yes, it's simular to having two network interfaces on one server. If it
works on solaris then clearly it can be make to work on linux as well.
Older versions of nfs-utils used only the IP from
gethostbyname(gethostname); Clearly that didn't work for setups like
this.
I wrote a patch that made it possible to change the IP-address to a
"service-IP". That allowed us to do failover like described in an
earlier mail. 
Later that feature has been extended and modified by others. It is
possible that it now allows multiple IP-addresses. If that's the case,
then half the problem is solved. 
The other half remains though.
