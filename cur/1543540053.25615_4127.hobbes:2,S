Just put it in fs/dcache.c, then dcache_init() can be static. And move
filescache_init() there too from kernel/fork.c (and files_cachep should
probably be declared somewhere in a header file). The kernel/fork.c
location happens to be where it is allocated/de-allocated, but
conceptually it's a VFS data structure. Oh, and file_table_init() and
dquot_init_hash should be there too..
The vma_init/buffer_init/page_cache_init/kiobuf_setup/ipc_init stuff
should probably be done as a "mm_init()" or something.
And fork_init/signals_init is probably kernel/fork.c, as "process_init()".
So that init/main.c looks a bit cleaner.
(init/main.c already looks a lot better than it _used_ to look. But if
people are changing it anyway, I'd rather change it a bit more to clean it
up further, than to just let it start expanding again..)
