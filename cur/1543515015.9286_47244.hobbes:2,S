One ploys used is to let someone violate your patent, then when sufficient
monies are involved nail them.  I know of a case in which the patent
holder knew a company was infringing and just waited until they became
big enough to make it worthwhile.  They won the suit and took over the
offending company in the process.
This was before the word stealth was in common use.
