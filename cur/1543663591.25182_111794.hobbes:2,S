Linux has a key feature that most other OS's lack:  It can (easily, and by all)
be recompiled for a particular architecture.  So, there is no particular reason why
optimizing for a high-end system has to kill performance on uni-processor
machines.
For instance, don't locks simply get compiled away to nothing on
uni-processor machines?
