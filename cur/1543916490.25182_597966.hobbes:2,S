where can I get this driver? I have a bunch of SDIO WiFi cards that
might contain Libertas chip.

The driver name will be btsdio and I will merge the initial version
within the 2.4.24 merge window. However this driver will go in via the
Bluetooth subsystem. My only request is that we can do the MMC merge
really early in the merge window.
