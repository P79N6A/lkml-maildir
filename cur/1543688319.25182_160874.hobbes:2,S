Subject: [PATCH] [2.4] /proc/ioports overrun for long device names
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

We've seen some memory corruption on systems where we have long device
names, since the last entry when you cat /proc/ioports might run over into
the next page. The check is only to make sure there's room for 80
characters, when there's more than that (i.e. 64-bit addresses + long
device names), there can be an overrun.
2.5 obviously doesn't have this because of seq_file.
Below patch will take the length of the name into consideration.
