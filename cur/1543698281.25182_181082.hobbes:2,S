Smells like a bio stacking problem in raid/dm then. I'll take a quick
look and see if anything obvious pops up, otherwise the maintainers of
those areas should take a closer look.

That might be a good idea, although it's not very likely to be an XFS
problem as it happens further down the io stack. It should trigger just
