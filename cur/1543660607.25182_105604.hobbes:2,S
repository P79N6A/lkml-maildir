Right. Alpha is way ahead, as usual. ;-)

I don't understand the issue, really. The config register says:
"MSIs are enabled". Which means: "My platform is *really* going to
use MSI". Why do you want to ignore that?
In the case when firmware has MSI enabled by mistake and it's known
that this platform cannot support MSI, we'll have a quirk that
fixes the config register. No?
