i do express discontent over yet another procfs bloat. What if procfs is
not mounted in a high security installation? Are affinities suddenly
unavailable? Such kind of dependencies are unacceptable IMO - if we want
to export the setting of affinities to user-space, then it should be a
system call.
(Also procfs is visibly slower than a system-call - i can well imagine
this to be an issue in some sort of threaded environment that creates and
destroys threads at a high rate, and wants to have a different affinity
for every new thread.)

this was a red herring - see chaff.c.

uhm, what check? A nonexistent system call does not have to be checked
for.
(so far no legitimate technical point has been made against the
syscall-based setting of affinities.)
