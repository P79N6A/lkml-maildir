Thanks for testing it. Indeed skipping the ticks alone does not really save 
any significant amount of power. The real chance for power savings comes from 
using this period for smarter C state programming. The other thing as you've 
noticed is that timers need to be curbed or minimised to get the maximum 
benefit and the ondemand governor alone, which unfortunately shows up as 
something not obvious in timertop, polls at 140HZ itself - fiddling with 
ondemand/ settings in sys can drop this but slows the rate at which it 
adapts.
I've basically stopped doing any development on dynticks at this time because 
I simply do not know enough about the interaction between the IO Apic and 
what is happening on SMP. The code to handle SMP seems sane, but I'll need 
outside help to cope with whatever the IO APIC is doing. UP is working fine, 
but it won't be long before truckloads of SMP laptops are here.
Cheers,
Con
