Thank you very much ;) Maybe i must use XSLT with 0.99 kernel, or
what?
I'm talking about patch posted here:

I've just noticed, that things on lines 5 and 6 may be optimized.
t7=`printf "%lu" $(( 0x$t4 - 0x$t5 ))`
No tr, no bc, no pipes -- magic!
Better know and use our *fine shell*.
And if you jouined us, Tim, maybe can share your experience and test
patch above and this one, please?

It's just my optimization hint. I have no bc, and i'm sure
things, like that will cause silent misinformation.
Anyway, what is so bad in `sh'?
Thanks.

GFDL. Enough of that bull, even Documentation/ is *free* from it.
Good bye.
