Welcome back everyone. Hope everyone had a happy holiday.

Nice. This could be very handy for embedded systems. A few notes as I was
looking over your code. Your driver does two things. One it does clipping
and has blit code etc. Now a new internal API for fbdev has been developed
for 2.3.X. In the new API instead of having fbcon-cfbX with a bunch of
console functions you have a fbcon-accel.c which has a console structure
that wraps around 3 video cards hardware accels, FillRect, CopyArea,
ImageBlt. With this you can seperate console code out of the fbdev drivers. 
Making fbdev driver writing easier. It also reduces the amount of
code. The biggest thing is since the console functions use accels this
removes the latency problems people have been having. It just takes to
long to do the above accel functions pixel by pixel. These accel functions
will be in the fbdev drivers so you could easily hook into them. Also I
have written some incomplete code that does blit, fillrect, copyarea in
software. The patch is at
http://imperial.edgeglobal.com/~jsimmons/linux-2.3.25-fb-0.8.patch.gz
Sorry I haven't kept it up to date but pieces of it have been going into
2.3.X. 
Note 2:
  As for handling input. Vojtech is making a universal input driver
suite. It has a /dev/event device that acts as a input queue shared
between userland and the kernel. Patch is at
http://www.suse.cz/development/input/
See about having your event packets to this device.
Just some helpful advice.
