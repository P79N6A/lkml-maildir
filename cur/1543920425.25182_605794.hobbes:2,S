Really, it sounds more like you want a custom driver that "owns" that 
region of memory so it's marked as used and this driver is the gate 
keeper.  I wonder if the console frame buffer driver for the mips ip32 
arch might be a good example for you as it swallows a several meg chunk of 
memory for the display.
