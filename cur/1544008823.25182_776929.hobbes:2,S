So would I. Unfortunately the regex is tightly coupled to turning on or 
off the function. This needs all functions enabled because we do not
know which functions the flagged one will call.
I could reuse the regex code if I add a call back to handle what to do on 
a match.  This is a bit more work, and will take some time to do.
If someone else has the time to do it, I would offer suggestions and 
review the code. Right now I do not have the time myself.

Ah, I did not see the '>>' that might be easier to do. I think you first
suggested this with a "!sched*" > set_ftrace_filter where the '>' would
truncate. But doing it with append '>>', might work.

Yep, agreed, A function is traced if the following conditions are true:
- function tracing is enabled
- the function is set to trace (not in set_ftrace_notrace)
- the pid filter is on and the current task has its trace bit set
 or the pid filter is off.
- the function filter is on and the function is in the trace array
 or the function filter is off

Hmm, that is starting to get quite complex, just to use. This is something 
we need to experiment with to find the best solution. I'd like to know use 
cases first. Currently I have a simple program that forks, traces itself 
and execs code to trace. It is exectued like:
  ./trace-func ls -ltr
to trace "ls -lrt",  this code would become a little more complex with the 
above methods.  But I'm not set in stone in any of these options. I just 
do not want to spend the days coding this to find out no one uses any of 
it but what is already there.
