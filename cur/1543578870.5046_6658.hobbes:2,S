Good job.

Actually, with the 4M pages, it's not a question of luck any more - they
just don't _have_ this bug, because on a machine with 4M pages the
"cpu_has_pse" case handles this all and the buggy code is never actually
entered.
Which explains why you'd only see this on a 386 (and I suspect your TLB
size explanation is what saved some i486-class machines, although later
i486 machines will have PSE as well).
