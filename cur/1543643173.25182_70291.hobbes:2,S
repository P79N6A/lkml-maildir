Sorry, I meant we should be wary about what is moved from being development code to non-development code in the stable kernel.

Exactly, I think we should.
The distributions will 'mirror' that, by including support, but not making it obvious unless you poke around looking for it - so it gets the new feature out to the more users, but doesn't present it as just another option for newbies to select without realising what they are doing.

But Linux doesn't crash...  :-)
