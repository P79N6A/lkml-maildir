I'd like it to be merged upstream too.
It may have problems, rough edges, whatever, but keeping out of tree
is more or less a guarantee that none of us will look & fix them ;)
If it gets upstream, I'll gladly finish the pmac support for it that
I quickly hacked recently for pmdisk as a proof of concept and help
figure out some of the remaining problems. I don't feel like doing
that with an out-of-tree project.
