The best and most portable (and efficient) way is to do write() or
send() with a large buffer (the bigger the better, modulo RAM
constraints).  TCP will do PMTU discovery for you and set the MSS as
large as possible.  If you're sending a real file (rather than
dynamically generated data) you can mmap() the file, which keeps you
from having to explicitly read it into memory, then call send() on the 
mmap()'ed buffer.
Is there some reason you need to send one packet at a time?  It's
horrendously inefficient--the goal is to minimize the number of
syscalls you make, and one per packet is a very large overhead.
