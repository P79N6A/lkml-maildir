yeah, something like that sounds sensible.
The principle is this: as long as it's an add-on attribute with a default 
value of zero, so that normal usage does not need to care about it, it's a 
reasonable extension. What we want to avoid is burdening the normal case 
with the weird cases. (and none of the things you mentioned seem to be in 
that category so we are fine.)
