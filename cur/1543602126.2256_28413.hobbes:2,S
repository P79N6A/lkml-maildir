Kinda OT, but ext3 is often treated more like a new file system than
an extension of ext2. I'm wondering if this is a good thing. On the
machines where I use it I have to compile both ext3 and ext2 (because
it would be foolish to not have ext2 support) into the kernel.
Theoretically, is there any reason why the codebases can't be
integrated, allowing you mount ext2 FS' without journalling using only
the ext3 code, and not requring a copy of its ancestor ext2 in the
kernel? Or is there a way already?
