Ours can only be sent to a specific processor.

And that's our problem.  The total number of hardware sources of interrupts
is N IO nodes * 6 buses per node * 2 slots per bus = 12N sources of
IO interrupts.  N can be anywhere between 1 and 256.  How big N is depends
entirely on how much money the customer wants to spend.  Some of our
customers have LOTS of money.  So, the IRQ space is sparse for small values
of N, with the density increasing with N.  It doesn't take long before
an interrupt vector is overloaded, so it only makes sense to try and
differentiate between interrupt vector x sent to processor y and 
interrupt vector x sent to processor z.

There are lots of alternatives.  However, most of them require deviating
significantly from what David has in the IA64 Linux patch.
However, we made the design decision that
we would try to co-exist peacefully with the IA64 Linux patch.  So far,
we have been able to do that.  We are THIS close (imagine finger and thumb
nearly touching) to living within the IA64 Linux code.  We just need
this small patch.  We want ALL of the code we develop for Linux and IA64
to live in some "official" (meaning, non-SGI) release.  Right now, I think
we're something under 100 lines of code different.  We want that to be
zero.

Still crazy, after all these years.
