Lastly, an app can still issue multiple sys_readaheads and still get
seek protection -- it isn't like disks have suddenly got faster than
CPUs overnight.
as-iosched.c can handle the case where a request goes out to disk, and
later a new one comes in nearby (deadline IIRC isn't good at this
unfortunately, nor does it seek backwards)
OTOH, if you're using as-iosched.c, you explicitly get a good amount of
seek protection anyway.
