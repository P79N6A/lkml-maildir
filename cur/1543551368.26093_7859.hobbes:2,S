one more finding -- deleting the strange 64M mtrr entry enabled the second
eepro100 interface!
# cat /proc/mtrr
reg00: base=0x00100000000 (    4096MB), size=    2048MB: write-combining,
count=1
reg02: base=0xfc000000 (4032MB), size=  64MB: uncachable, count=1
# 
# echo "disable=2" > /proc/mtrr 
# cat /proc/mtrr
reg00: base=0x00100000000 (    4096MB), size=    2048MB: write-combining,
count=1
(now down and up the interface and it works. Both eepro100 work)
but the machine is still intolerably slow. Where did this 64M entry come
from? (I don't have agp or drm support enabled or anything like that, I
don't even have an agp bus!) It would be nice if /proc/mtrr showed eip of
the caller who set up the entry :)
