Many thanks, Ruurd, for mailing me, too! - I'm not reading
linux-kernel completely and looked only for 'aci' is subjects...
First, I've put up a new patch, so don't use this old one. Please read
my post to linux-kernel:
http://boudicca.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/latest/0133.html
Second, the described problem is solved: the functions don't exists
anymore... (:
Third, my patch still has the same problem. <-:  As noted, try my
patch only when aci and radio-pcm20 is selected as module.
I will work on this issue.
And I have a request to everyone owning a miroSOUND (or Cardinal
Technologies) card:
Please try my patch and send me the version line. Mine looks like:
<ACI 0x07, id 6d/43 "m/C", (PCM20 radio)> at 0x344
The patch has some enhancements over the original; read more in my
first post:
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0009.2/0260.html
The plans for the future are a well done support of the RDS functions
for the "PCM20 radio" and maybe an ALSA driver. This would help me to
support the equalizer in the "PCM20 radio" better.
Thanks,
	Robert
