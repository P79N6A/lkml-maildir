Yes I was wrong on this one, but after looking at the acenic I think
the current solution is not very nice to driver authors.

It's more a generic problem with PCI DMA API, acenic just happens to
be the clearest victim of it @)

How about a new function (pci_nonrepresentable_address() or whatever) 
that returns true when page cache contains pages that are not representable
physically as void *. On IA32 it would return true only if CONFIG_PAE is 
true and there is memory >4GB. 
Then the network driver could do
	if (!pci_nonrepresentable_address()) 
		dev->features |= NETIF_F_HIGHDMA;
[in theory it would be possible to push it up into dev.c to avoid
bounces for highmem memory <4GB, but I don't want to teach such details
to the generic layer]
DAC support would be the next step, not necessarily one for 2.4, but perhaps
one that could be backported from 2.5 at some point.
