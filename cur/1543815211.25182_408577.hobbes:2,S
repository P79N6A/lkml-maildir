There's a UML filesystem for which the nodev-implies-no-fsck behavior
is inconvenient.  It stores its files as files on the host, where the
file metadata is stored separately from the file data.  If the two
fall out of sync after a crash, we need to fsck it.  In this case,
fsck would do a hostfs mount of the data and metadata (where the files
are available as they exist on the host) and fix things up.
So, in this case, the thing being fscked is a directory hierarchy on
the host.
