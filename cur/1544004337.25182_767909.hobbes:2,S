Subject: [PATCH] [BUGFIX]cgroup: fix potential deadlock in pre_destroy.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Balbir, Paul, Li, How about this ?
=
As Balbir pointed out, memcg's pre_destroy handler has potential deadlock.
It has following lock sequence.
	cgroup_mutex (cgroup_rmdir)
	    -> pre_destroy
		-> mem_cgroup_pre_destroy
			-> force_empty
			   -> lru_add_drain_all->
			      -> schedule_work_on_all_cpus
                                 -> get_online_cpus -> cpuhotplug.lock.
But, cpuset has following.
	cpu_hotplug.lock (call notifier)
		-> cgroup_mutex. (within notifier)
Then, this lock sequence should be fixed.
Considering how pre_destroy works, it's not necessary to holding
cgroup_mutex() while calling it. 
As side effect, we don't have to wait at this mutex while memcg's force_empty
works.(it can be long when there are tons of pages.)
Note: memcg is an only user of pre_destroy, now.
