Hello,
I installed RH 6.1 on my Sony F190, and unfortunatelly when I run sndconfig
the program just stops! It asks me if I have a Dell Ispiron, and if I want
to continue.  I say YES, but nothing happens.  I went to the RH website, and
in the 'gotcha' session it says that I should download the latest sndconfig
rpm.  However it looks like the latest sndconfig is the one I already have.
Did anyone have the sameproblem?
Thanks and Marry Christmas!
Guido
