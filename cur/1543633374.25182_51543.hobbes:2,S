When the number of runnable processes exceeds the number of CPUs
in an SMP system, and subsets of the runnable processes share data
(pipes, sockets, shared memory, etc.), minimizing the cache invalidate
effects of the subset by scheduling them on the same CPU (with some
level of cache-affinity, or stickiness) can increase throughput
dramatically.  Oracle Apps and BAAN are two application sets that have
this kind of behavior which benefited from having these subsets of
related processes "tied at the wrists" when they were scheduled.
Figure 1000 runnable process, in sets of two or even sets of ten.
The subsets should be scheduled together if possible, but still
smeared across all processors.  No one is suggesting that a UP machine
will always outperform an SMP machine.  ;-)
As was mentioned in another aspect of this thread, this is different
from explicit user-specified CPU affinity in that there are more processes
than a user wants to allocate explicitly to CPUs.  Instead, the scheduler
can do load balancing by moving/migrating sets of processes from an
overloaded CPU to a less loaded CPU.  However, the cache effects can
make a difference of something like 20-50% of overall throughput in
a fairly intensive data sharing workload like this.

This is an SMP thing, which also benefits NUMA pretty dramatically.
And this is about how processes are scheduled, and how hints can
be provided to the scheduler.  It also relates to the overhead of
cache invalidation, the size of CPU caches, etc.  Sequent's hardware
might have seen a bigger improvement from this type of change than
other types of hardware might.  Or vice versa.
