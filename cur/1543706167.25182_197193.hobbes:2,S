Hello,
on IBM Thinkpads R31 this is also easiliy to reproduce:
For 2.6. one only needs to read from /proc/apm or /proc/acpic/...
and the mouse becomes crazy and one gets the throwing 2 bytes away
messages in the log files. By fast reading in an endless loop even
input from the keyboard is ignored.
For 2.4. this only happens on reading from /proc/apm, somehow acpi is not
affected in 2.4. kernel versions.
Well, for R31's it is said that it is the bad bios, but maybe its
related? Any ideas why it doesn't happen with acpi and 2.4.? 
My knowlege of the kernel interals is quite low and pretty much limited
to the basic vfs area, so could you please give me some good advises how to
debug this?
Thanks,
	Bernd
