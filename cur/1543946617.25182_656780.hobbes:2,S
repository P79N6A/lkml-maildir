We do not need to do any allocation in the messaging layer, all
structures used for messaging are allocated at module load time.
The allocation discussions we had early on were about trying to
rearrange you notifiers to allow a seperate worker thread to do the
invalidate and then the main thread would spin waiting for the worker to
complete.  That was canned by the moving your notifier to before the
lock was grabbed which led us to the point of needing a _begin and _end.

So, fundamentally, how would they be different?  Would we be required to
add another notifier list to the mm and have two seperate callout
points?  Reduction would end up with the same half-registered
half-not-registered situation you point out above.  Then further
reduction would lead to the elimination of the callouts you have just
proposed and using the _begin/_end callouts and we are back to
Christoph's current patch.
