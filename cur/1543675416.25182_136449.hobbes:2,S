clear_queue_congested() is doing an opportunistic check for list_empty()
without taking a lock. The patch basically changes list_empty() to look
at elements of the list instead of just pieces of the head. As opposed
to auditing for this, could you remove the __list_head_check() from
list_empty() and try again?
Thanks.
