Changing licenses is not like changing software code, re-licensing is
a major hassle so "release early, release often" is not a viable
strategy.
That means GPL v3 is not a nice localised incremental patch but a huge
patchset on all the issues that have accumulated since GPLv2 was
written (and one can discuss the correctness of parts of this
patchset)
