This is a bit off-topic for linux-kernel as the Euro symbol is a userland
issue.
However visit:
http://www.ispo.cec.be/y2keuro/euroit.htm
This page has a link to a pdf file which contains the official :-
 Recommendation for the placement of the euro sign on computer
 keyboards and similar information processing equipment (PDF),
 European Commission, 19 June 1998 .
The key used for the Euro varies amongst the various national keyboards,
the most common are AGr-4 and Agr-e.
