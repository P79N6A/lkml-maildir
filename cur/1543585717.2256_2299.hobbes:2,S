I would be more than happy to fix the problem properly if I knew the first
thing about the vm subsystem, but I don't.

While my post didn't give an exact formula, I was quite clear on the fact that
the system is allowing the caches to overrun memory and cause oom problems. 
I'm more than happy to test patches, and I would even be willing to suggest
