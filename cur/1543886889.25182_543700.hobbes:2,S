Actually, I'm not the author of this workaround.  And looking at it 
closer, the current workaround is utterly buggy as it completely inhibit 
CRC error reporting for everything but the listed commands when the MSB 
of the response is a zero.

Indeed.
Please apply the following patch.  It is compile tested only as I don't 
have PXA27x hardware with MMC at the moment, but it just cannot be worse 
than the current code even when it was compiling.

Subject: fix PXA27x MMC workaround for bad CRC on R2 response erratum
