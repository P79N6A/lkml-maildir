It is correct by definition, the existing part of an ABI may not change.

Sure you can add new functionality in a defined way.  You can add to
the ABI.  You may not modify an existing definition.  But that has
no implications for existing working code.

But since the older interface still remains you don't have to change
klibc, uclibc, dietlibc, and whatever else does not care.  Making
it easy to change an existing ABI is simply wrong.
If you were to increment the syscall numbers by one no amount of automation
in the world would make that a kernel that would be usable on a production
box.  The only way it could even work is if you were to declare that
kernel uses a new ABI.

If things must be maintained in concert it is a bug.  
With a fixed ABI people take advantage of new features as they
care for them.  And in general to use new features requires new code.
If people are adding and changing ioctls/sysctls/prctls left and right,
and that is what is causing the maintenance problem, then that is the
problem.  And that is where the problem needs to be reigned in at.

Agreed.
Calling it documentation simply makes it clear what the headers are,
and suggest that the machine readable for does not need to be C source
code.
