_I_ wouldn't need that since I'm not interested in internal business of
either of these filesystems (BTW, iso9660 is perfectly capable of supporting
symlinks - google for rockridge or just take a look at any "live fs" ISO
image from damn next to any distro).
And no, this stuff will stay on fs level.  There will be no magic flag
saying "this fs has funny symlinks implementation".  Consider that one
vetoed - and I _really_ doubt that going directly to Linus will give
you anything but LARTing in that case.  Severe LARTing, judging by
the precedents...
If modifications for vfat and ntfs will happen to have common functions -
just put them into a library and use them in both filesystems.  _If_ you
manage to convince the maintainers of VFAT and NTFS resp. that it's worth
the trouble, in the first place.
