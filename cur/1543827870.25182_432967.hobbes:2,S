We are looking into how this can be best accomplished, given the
requirements of the various stackable filesystems out there.

We will work on fixes for any such issues brought to our attention. Up
to this point, we have provided fixes for all but two of the items
Christoph brought up in his initial analysis of eCryptfs. The
setlk/getlk code is redundant with the existing VFS implementations,
and so we are working on a fix for that.

We would appreciate any suggestions folks in the community could give
on this.
Until then, is this patch a reasonable approach to address the problem
of just replacing the vfsmount and dentry in the existing nameidata
struct?

Don't muck with the existing nameidata structures.
