What is the difference?  `gcc' implements standard C.  For some of the
standard C requirements it relies on libc, for some it has its own ways
of providing them.  One such way is to generate assembler code from its 
parse trees, another is through linking to libgcc.a.  Thus libgcc.a is
in one sense not really a library so much as just part of the compiler.
Horst is right.  `ld' is very good at extracting a single object file
out of a library, and libgcc.a is (like any good library) compiled one
function per object file.  Why do this work by hand?
