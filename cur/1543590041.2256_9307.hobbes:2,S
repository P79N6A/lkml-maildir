Hi there,
I think there is a bug in the 2.4 icmp code regarding PMTU discovery.
It seems to be inconsistent between reboots: at one boot echo replies always
have the DF bit set, while after another boot they don't, indicating that
this is caused by an uninitialized parameter.
Even 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc' doesn't change this
behaviour.
I can't think of any legitimate reasons for doing PMTU discovery on ICMP
packets, and since it actually in some situations breaks ping in combination
with FreeS/WAN (I can elaborate, if anyone is interested), I would suggest
to turn it off in a consistent manner.
The patch below (against 2.4.4) should accomplish this.
