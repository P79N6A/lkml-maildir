No.
It's a locking issue. In __alloc_pages we may be
holding some IO locks (gfp_mask & __GFP_IO == 0),
then we wait on kswapd and schedule out. The result is that
kswapd will be spinning on a lock it can never get.
The fix for this was included in the patch I sent to Linus
for 2.4.0-tes9-pre2, but unfortunately not included.
Ia'll send it agani soon.
There is anathor, more subtle, case like this in
buffer.c, which I have also fixed in my local tree here.
The patch for this will be online on my home paeg
soon. (connectivity isn't that great as you can see from mytyping)
cheers,
Rik
