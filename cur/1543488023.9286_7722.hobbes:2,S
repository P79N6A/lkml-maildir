Hi!
I'm running a vanilla 2.2.2 kernel which, if I leave it alone for a while,
will stop responding to pings from off the current subnet.  It responds
correctly to a ping from the local subnet, however.  And I know it's not
the network -- I can ping a 2.0.36 box sitting next to it but not the
2.2.2 box.  I've upgraded net-tools and the rest.  I'm going to try to
switch back to 2.2.1, but if anyone has any ideas, I'd be happy to try.
In all cases, I'm using a 3Com EtherLink III (3C509).
Thanks,
Jim
