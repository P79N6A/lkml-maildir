I like, although I am not hot on the name, but that is just taste.
One minor nit: it is not preempt-safe.  But then again, neither is any
code that calls it without disabling preemption first.  Maybe put a
comment above it like:
	/*
	 * is_current_cpu() - are we running on the given processor?
	 *
	 * Note this is not preempt-safe: you need to explicitly
	 * disable preemption before calling this if you care
	 * about any consistency in the result
	 */
The problem is not so much the call itself, but the use of the results. 
Anywhere you care that 'cpu' is the current processor, kernel preemption
needs to remain disabled.
