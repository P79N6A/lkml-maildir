Ok, if you want some practice with "real" merges, feel free to merge from
the following two trees whenever you are ready:
	kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/aoe-2.6.git/
for 11 aoe bugfix patches, and:
	kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
for 13 driver core, sysfs, and debugfs fixes.
The diffstats are:

No rush, but they should be good test for your merge speeds, as they are
based off of an older HEAD than your current one :)

That would be very nice to have.
