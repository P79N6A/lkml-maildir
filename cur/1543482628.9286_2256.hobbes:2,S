Subject: RealAudio failure in 2.2.0?

I've read about RA failing in 2.1.x in the past, but I just ran
RA 5.0 in 2.2.0 and it appeared to go fine for quite a while.  I
went to the following URL
http://www.zdnet.com/zdtv/screensavers/supergeek/story/0,3656,2189367,00.html
where you'll find a dumb Linux quiz, however on the second or
third question is a realaudio link to an interview with Linus
which I thought would be very interesting.  The interview died
just about near the end and realaudio said that an error had
occured and told me to go check some error thing on their site
(to which I've got no intention of doing), but when I quit RA,
Netscape reported:  
**** audio: write error: 898 bytes errno:11
in a small infowindow entitled "subprocess diagnostics
stderr/stdout".
I dunno if it is a kernel thing or not, but it's the first
failure I've had with real audio, and I tried it in 2.0.36 and
the thing played through ok.
Take care.
