  Yeah, that's right as long as userland pthread_mutexes are used, but
currently, pthread_condvars do not use PI-futexes. Therefore when we
have some threads sleeping on a condvar and the condvar is broadcasted,
those blocked threads are woken up through futex_requeue() in the order
they were put to sleep and not in their priority order.
  Maybe the pthread_cond_*() function should be made to use the
PI-futexes support in glibc.

  Right, I will try to quantify the impact for SCHED_OTHER tasks. Any
pointers to such a benchmark?
  Thanks,
