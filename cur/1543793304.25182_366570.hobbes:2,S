there was [anticipatory] selected.
ORIGINAL:
tiger:~#  grep . /sys/block/*/queue/scheduler
/sys/block/fd0/queue/scheduler:noop [anticipatory] deadline cfq
/sys/block/hdd/queue/scheduler:noop [anticipatory] deadline cfq
/sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler:noop [anticipatory] deadline cfq
/sys/block/sdb/queue/scheduler:noop [anticipatory] deadline cfq
NEW:
tiger:~#  grep . /sys/block/*/queue/scheduler
/sys/block/fd0/queue/scheduler:noop anticipatory deadline [cfq]
/sys/block/hdd/queue/scheduler:noop anticipatory deadline [cfq]
/sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler:noop anticipatory deadline [cfq]
/sys/block/sdb/queue/scheduler:noop anticipatory deadline [cfq]
System seems to work, but I need some testing time to check that
behaviour. (Any suggestion of a testing tool to generate disk
traffic and reporting response-times and throughput?)
Which is the right way / position on bootup to set this field
permanent to this value and what exactly did I change with this
modification? (Performance issues?)
I'm using debian..
I also need to check this on the other (identical) machines.
Thanks! Miro Dietiker

Can you check which IO scheduler the drives are using, try different
schedulers, and see if it makes a different.
     grep . /sys/block/*/queue/scheduler
will show you (the one in [brackets] is active). 
Then just echo a new value out to each file.
I've had one report that [anticipatory] causes this problem and [cfq]
removes it.  Could you confirm that?
Thanks,
