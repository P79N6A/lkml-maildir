This is a genuine dead-lock.  The police lock can be taken
for reading with softirqs on.  If a second CPU tries to take
the police lock for writing, while holding the ingress lock,
then a softirq on the first CPU can dead-lock when it tries
to get the ingress lock.
The minimal fix would be to make sure that we disable BH on
the first CPU.  Jamal, could you take a look at this please?
Thanks,
