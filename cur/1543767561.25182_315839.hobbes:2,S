I retested with my tree and everything works for me as expected.
Well actually there is a problem with the core mappings,
but not on dual core, but on single core (more cosmetic than real)
It is possible that some patch is missing again in mainline.
I will sync up my patchkit next week and double check then
that mainline is in the same state as mine.
