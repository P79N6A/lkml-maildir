I compiled 2.4.3-pre6 and 2.4.2-ac21 and noticed, that aviplay works
much worse than before. Avifile benchmark told me:
Average video output speed: 20.566223 Mb/s
On 2.2.18 and earlier 2.4.2-ac* it gives 50-55Mb/s.
mtrr is enabled:
[jp@darkwood jp]$ cat /proc/mtrr
reg00: base=0xe8000000 (3712MB), size=  32MB: write-combining, count=2
My hardware: K6-2 500, VIA MVP3, Voodoo3
