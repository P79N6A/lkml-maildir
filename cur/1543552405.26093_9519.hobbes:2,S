Subject: [PATCH] fs/nls/Config.in -- Again
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/10/23/181

This is the suggestion that Petr made and was approved by the maintainer.
Can we get this in 2.4.0-test10-pre6 please?  Without this patch, if
you have CONFIG_INET turned off, you have to go through the CONFIG_NLS
stuffs.
