Hi,
The bug causing problems with the evolution address book is fixed in
2.5.56. I don't know if it was fixed in 2.5.55 or 2.5.56 but it was
broken in 2.5.54.
This bug(#112) is listed as RESOLVED at bugme.osdl.org. Should it be
moved to CLOSED?
Also how would one find out what the resolution was at bugme.osdl.org?
Is there a pointer to patch or cset that I missed somewhere there?
Regards,
Shane
