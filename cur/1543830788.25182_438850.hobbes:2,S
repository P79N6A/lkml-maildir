They have to because if there was another interrupt it would execute
IRET and then clear the NMI flag in the hardware and allow nested NMIs 
which would cause all sorts of problems.
The only reason to change it would be complex callbacks in the
current handlers using notifier chains. Maybe if they're that complex they 
should become simpler?
