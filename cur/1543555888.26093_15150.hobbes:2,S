slow !! end-user want to install a distribution fast !!! 
it need a lot to be friendly the compilation (ie: we cannot do only
launch of make xconfig, not everyone now which options to select),
what we can do is a detection of the module and recompile a kernel
with the detected module for recompilation but there is too much error
case that could not be handle.
