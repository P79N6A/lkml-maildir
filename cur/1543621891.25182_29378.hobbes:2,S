In my opinion the idea of cset -x (while usefull) is fundamentally
broken.  The result of this is that ideas like blacklist need to be
considered.  I would propose instead an undo -x, that would
generate a cset to reverse the one following the -x.  This might
lead to conflicts - these would be resolved the normal bk fashion.
If bk handled ¯bad¯ csets in this manner there would be no need for
blacklists - it is more robust in that you can always used undo -x.
Comments?
