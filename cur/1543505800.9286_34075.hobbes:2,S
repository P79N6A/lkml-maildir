Just to add to the amount of gathered data about mouse problems:
I have a Logitech Mouseman+ Wheel.  This is the FOUR button one
with the button on the side and the middle button is also a
wheel.  RedHat 6.0 sets it as "pnp" for the type with GPM,
however my /var/log/messages file gets gpm errors printed in it
all day long.  Some times it says "message repeated 238 times"
and stuff like that.
The mouse WORKS fine.  No noticeable problems, but the errors in
the log make the log grow fast.  Note that there are bootleg
mice like this, and I know mine is NOT a bootleg.  It is an
official Logitech mouse (just so nobody tells me my mouse is
broken and a clone bootleg).
If anyone thinks that this might also be related to the problems
with mice, I would be glad to send syslog chunks, and any other
debugging info I can to aide in this matter.  I'm also willing to
muck with my mouse driver, etc... if something needs to be
tested.
