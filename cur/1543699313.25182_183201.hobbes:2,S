Which is?  How is it that you can spend a page of text saying a judge doesn't
care about technicalities and then base the rest of your argument on the
distinction between a "plugin" and a "kernel module"?
    "Yes, your honor, I know you don't care about technicalities but let
    me explain how a kernel model, which is a wad of code that may be
    plugged into a program called the kernel and which provides some
    additional functionality or feature, is legally different than a
    plugin, which is a wad of code that may be plugged into some other
    program not called the kernel and which provides some additional
    functionality or feature.  These are not all the same things, your
    honor, you see that, right?"
Gimme a break, Linus.  You can't have it both ways.

You need to reread your own postings on the topic over the years.  There are
documents all the web citing you as saying that binary drivers and modules 
are fine.
