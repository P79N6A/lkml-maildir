Addendum, amanda finished early, it seems tar thought every level was a 
level 0, so it ran out of storage after only 3 dle's were processed and 
backed up.  There are about 25 dle's.  It tried to put 11GB on an 8GB 
vtape, which because it was a vtape, it could do.
So it appears something in the ext3 filesystem is sadly miss-informing tar 
when it does the estimate scan vs doing the real file reading.  Or the 
scan is updating the ctime?
I'm back on 2.6.20-ck1 & everything is copacetic again.  I'll find out if 
the filesystem is damaged tomorrow night cause if the ctimes are all 
screwed up, amanda will effectively be starting from scratch.  That is 
not exactly a Good Thing(TM).
I did find the ls -lt command, and the filesystem looks ok timewise when 
rebooted now.  I have no more ready clues without your able questions to 
guide me on this.
