but drm_lock() doesn't even try to block SIGKILL?
However, I think that block_all_signals() and its usage are broken
in many ways. To name a few,
1. It can't work for multithread programs. dequeue_signal() checks
   current->notifier, but this is per thread, not per process.
2. We can't block the "pseudo signals" (freezer).
3. If we want to block SIGKILL, we should also block at least all
   sig_kernel_coredump() signals. But this is not easy to do for
   multithread programms, all sub-threads except ->group_exit_task
   go to sleep in TASK_STOPPED state without doing dequeue_signal()
   at all.
4. What about other sig_fatal() signals?
5. drm_lock() blocks SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU. Suppose
   that (say) SIGTSTP is pending. In that case we in fact block
   _all_ signals whose numeric value > SIGTSTP. This is somewhat
   strange.
Probably something else... Actually, the whole idea looks broken to
me, but yes, it is very easy to blame somebody else's code and I
don't even remotely understand what drm is.
I tried to google for the patch which introduced this interface
but failed. Looks like this is very old thing.
Actually, I can't understand the explanation above. What if the
task which holds the hardware lock doesn't recieve SIGSTOP, but
instead does something like "for (;;) ;" ?
