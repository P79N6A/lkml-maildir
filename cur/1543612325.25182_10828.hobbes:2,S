Hi Guys,
A friend of mine is having a problem connecting to Blueyonder's SMTP
server with a 2.4.16 Kernel.  He has helpfully provided the following
information to illustrate the problem.  Is this a known issue with 2.4.16?
 Can anyone help?  If so, what more information do you need (tcpdump
output, .config file, ...?)
# telnet smtp.blueyonder.co.uk 25 
Connection refused
# ping smtp.blueyonder.co.uk
Replied normally
# telnet <any other mail server including Telewest's inbound one> 25
Worked fine
# nmap -sS -P 25 smtp.blueyonder.co.uk
Showed the port as open
# nmap -sT -P 25 smtp.blueyonder.co.uk
Showed the port as closed
After this, he rebooted back in to the RedHat 2.4.9 Kernel (RedHat 7.2
with updates applied) and it was all fine.  Unfortunately he had already
fired off a nasty email to Blueyonder's tech support (but it serves them
right for running a Microsoft server).
Cheers,
--
