Subject: Stability of 2.6.17-rc3?

Was hoping 2.6.17 would be out within one week, doesn't look like it
is going to happen.
My thesis defense is coming up, need to merge my patches against some kernel
(requiring 2.6.16.1 looks weird).
On a machine that 2.6.16.1 runs bug-free, is it sane to assume
2.6.17-rc3 will as well?
If it fails outright, I can revert, but if it is unstable I'm going to
have some problems.
(You would be surprised how long it took me to discover a mistake that
sys_rename(on any filesystem) -> deadlock with my custom patch).
