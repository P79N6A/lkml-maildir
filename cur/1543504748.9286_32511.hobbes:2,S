Yes, I did say it had problems...

But there are some truly evil hw schemes out there, and it could get
worse.
This decoupling allows transparent access to buses/resources which are
paged/addressed in very small lumps (sometimes just address/data
registers) into the CPUs visible address region, at the expense of
speed. 
Normally I would leave this in the specific drivers, but I seem to be
hearing more about these sort of things, and wonder whether a generic
interface so the drivers can be easily layered makes sense.
It is cumbersome, it is in many ways ugly as I said, but it depends on
what you are trying to do - the importance of the layering property is a
point to consider, however I merely mentioned it in case someone
elsewhere saw merit in it.
