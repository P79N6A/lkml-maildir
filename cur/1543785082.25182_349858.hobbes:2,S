Their code doesn't scale well to current needs at all.  Please look
at the freebsd-scsi list and all the problems they have with things
like FC or iSCSI.  Or no support for REPORT_LUNs at all.  While I
wouldn't say we have the best thing since slided bread it's certainly
not as bad as some people would like to make it.

That's not true at all.  Neither is 100% mandatory in the
scsi level.  As Luben's code shows you can just call scsi_add_device
and do everything yourself.  That is nice for LLDDs that don't
fit into SAM at all like integrated RAID HBAs.  Besides that we
support a library function to do the "l" part that can be used by
transport classes or drivers.  There's a library function to do
the "i" part brute-force for SPI and modelled after SPI devices that
is still in scsi_mod.ko but isn't integrated with the core code
in any way.  Before 2.6 the predessor to this function
"scsi_scan_host" was called for every registered host, but we
fortunately got rid of that.
