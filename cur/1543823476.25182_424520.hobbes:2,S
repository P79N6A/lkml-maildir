The code was not added to the bitkeeper repository, but to a CVS
mirror of it.  It was spotted quickly thanks to rigorous checksumming
done by the CVS exporter in BK.
One of the current trends in version control software is toward
cryptographically signed changesets, meaning that sneaking something
in without access to a trusted private key is about as close to
impossible as you can get.
There is still the question of who you can *really* trust of course.
After all, how do we know that Dave Miller (who was "credited" for the
mentioned backdoor attempt) isn't really a bad guy?
