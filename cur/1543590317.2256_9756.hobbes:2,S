int fd = open (name, O_RDWR);
char* adr = (char*) mmap (0, len, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
/* write to *adr through *(ard+len-1) */
/* Try adding here: msync (adr, len, MS_SYNC); */
munmap (adr, len);
close (fd);
The code works on files on local harddisks and on NFS volumes on a 2.2
kernel, but breaks on NFS drives on a 2.4.4 kernel.
msync() works around the bug.
Andrea's patch did help as well.
