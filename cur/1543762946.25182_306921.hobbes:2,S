Wow. Great point. I completely missed that possibility. In fact I didn't
know that the compiler could possibly alter the order of the
instructions. For one thing, I thought it was simply not allowed to. For
another, I didn't know that it had been made so aware that it could
actually figure out how to do this kind of things. What a mess. Let's
just hope that the gcc folks know their business :)
I'll try to remember this next time I debug something. Do not assume
that instructions are run in the order seen in the source. Irk.

Interesting. Then wouldn't it be worth attempting such compilations at
times, and see if we get additional oops? Doesn't gcc have a flag to
specifically forbid this family of optimizations?
Thanks,
