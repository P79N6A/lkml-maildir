Where what is visible to userspace? If you mean the bit about 
"the interface it presents to the world", I meant Linux in 
general, not this feature. The whole point is that this is 
invisble to userspace (apart from performance and a lack of
architectural restrictions you might have been expecting) 
therefore it's irrelevant to whether it's "Unix" like or not.
