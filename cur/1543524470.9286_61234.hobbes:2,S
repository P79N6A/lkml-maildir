According to. Evan Langlois :
| I've been having the exact same problems, also with an AMD K6 (K6-II to
| be exact).  It also says "Unable to handle kernel paging request).  I
| just assumed I had done something wrong, or that there was a compiler
| bug, or one of my MANY modules had a bug or was outdated and  needed a
| recompile.
I made two changes since .. and upgraded the kernel to .42
My latest kernel 2.3.42 -- i compiled it with K6-II/III processor
(CONFIG_MK6) setting in .config -- it has not crashed yet. probably it helped.
I also had ulimit setting for virtual memory (==swap size=4xmain-meory) -- 
raising it to unlimited also may have helped stop the OOPS. {all oops were 
in free pages code...}
