The linux/list.h implementation is a bit weird at first (at least I
found it so) but is perfectly adequate and very neat once you get used
to it. Here is your example program rewritten to use linux/list.h
(modulo insertion/traversal order - easily changeable):
------------------------ <list.c> ------------------------
#include <stdio.h>
#include "list.h"
struct node {
	int data;
	struct list_head list;
};
int main(void)
{
	struct list_head queue, *tmp;
	struct node n1, n2, n3;
	n1.data = 1;
	n2.data = 2;
	n3.data = 3;
	INIT_LIST_HEAD(&queue);
	list_add(&n1.list, &queue);
	list_add(&n2.list, &queue);
	list_add(&n3.list, &queue);
	tmp = queue.next;
	while(tmp != &queue) {
		struct node *n = list_entry(tmp, struct node, list);
		printf("%d\n", n->data);
		tmp = tmp->next;
	}
	list_del(&n2.list);
	list_del(&n1.list);
	list_del(&n3.list);
}
------------------------ </list.c> -----------------------

Borislav
