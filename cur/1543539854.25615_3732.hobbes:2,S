As with some of the Intel CPU bugs, the problem is NOT "invalid ATA
commands" - it's a matter of VALID commands which are dangerous. FDIV on
early Pentiums isn't an invalid instruction - it just produces the wrong
results at times. So the SOFTWARE must do something to avoid this - either
that, or you need to replace the hardware, which isn't desirable. You do
something in the OS to prevent these problem commands being used.
