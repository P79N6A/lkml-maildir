20 kbytes per disk+filesystem seems reasonable.
The "Buffers" will be the superblock (4k) and the group descriptor blocks
(256 bytes per gigabyte of disk).  These are pinned memory.
And the ext2 superblock got bigger in -mm due to the recent scalability
patches.
What is using the "size-8192" allocation there?  It could be the ext2 superblock
if you have NR_CPUS=32.
