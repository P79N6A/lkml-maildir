Note:  that same bug exists/existed on i386 back when NO_HZ was
introduced (2.6.21?).  I still see it from time to time on my Quad core
system (very rare), but not any more on my Duo notebook where it used
to happen about 1 in n boots (n < 10).
AFAICT no fix was ever released for it.

I *still* get very slow resume-from-RAM quite often here
(new in 2.6.22 kernel, wasn't there in early 2.6.23-rc*).
Something eventually times out after a minute or so
and it comes back.  Cannot make it happen reliably,
unless I'm in a hurry to get something done.  :)
I suspect USB here, probably the same loopy bug that
we added a "loop limit failsafe" for back in 2.6.21(?).
