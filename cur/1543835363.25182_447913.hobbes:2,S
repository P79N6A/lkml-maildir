IMO the right way here would be to have a nice GUI for configuring udev
included with the distro, that'd let you browse the sysfs tree and
point'n'click to create the rule you need.

The reason behind this was to force people NOT use sysfs directly when
interfacing to the OS. ;)
Because sysfs wasn't intended to be an API you can rely on, one that's
fixed in stone and cannot be changed for compatibility reasons. I
believe it failed in that respect.

Sure. It was just one of the points raised there.

You want the frequent readouts even for slow changes of the direction of
gravity there, that's what I wanted to say.
