i dont think we disagree. What i was referring to was the 'original' Unix
idea, the 30 years old one, which did not include sendfile() :-) We never
claimed that sendfile() first came up in Linux [that would be a blatant
lie] - and the Linux API itself was indeed influenced by existing
sendfile()/copyfile() interfaces. (at the time Linus implemented
sendfile() there already existed several similar interfaces.)

good move :-) [honestly.]

:-) I think sendfile() should also have its logical extensions:
receivefile(). I dont know how the HPUX implementation works, but in
Linux, right now it's only possible to sendfile() from a file to a socket.
The logical extension of this is to allow socket->file IO and file->file,
socket->socket IO as well. (the later one could be interesting for things
like web proxies.)
