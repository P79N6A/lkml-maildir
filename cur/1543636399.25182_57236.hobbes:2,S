Maybe I wasn't very clear, but if I disable the 'return -1', the mouse
will work, and the debugging data is like in:
	...
	i8042.c: 08 <- i8042 (interrupt, aux, 12) [627526]
	i8042.c: 03 <- i8042 (interrupt, aux, 12) [627527]
	i8042.c: 00 <- i8042 (interrupt, aux, 12) [627528]
	...
If I do not disable the 'return -1', the mouse will not be found at
all, and moving it will get no messages in the logs...
