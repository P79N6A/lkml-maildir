Friends,
    I have written a kernel Virtual file system which merges different
filesystem directories. For this I am using a VFS function
inode_dir_notify() function to notify the parent inodes. Now I want my
virtual file system to be converted as a module. I am facing problems
while inserting the module. When I do a insmod it is giving
Unresolved symbol inode_dir_notify even though it is defined in the kernel
VFS. It is working in case of statically linked version.
Can somebody please suggest me why this is happening?
Please CC the reply to san@cse.iitkgp.dhs.org
Thanks and regards,
sathya
