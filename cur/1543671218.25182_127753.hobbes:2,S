For that, refer to my other bug: 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622
During window-switching activities in X, ALSA sound is interrupted. It 
is quite annoying. For this reason, I have actually gone back to using a 
2.4 kernel with OSS, though I hear my problem would not exist if I use 
deprecated OSS in 2.5.x.
This is on a fairly popular AC97 i810 chipset.
