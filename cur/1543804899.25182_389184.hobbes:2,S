glibc needs to be able to find out if a certain address is writable. (eg
mapped "w"). The only way available for that is... reading the maps
file.

for this 0400 isn't enough; because you can open this file, send the fd
over a unix socket, and then exec. The process you sent the fd to can
then read the setuid's program maps file. 
This thing is all a bit more complex than just the file mode ;(
