No, it shouldn't.  There must of been a bug in the new sysrq code merged
in.  Personally, I would just enable sysrq support for now.

Btw, this isn't the preemption patches fault, although I would recommend
you use the patches I make explicitly for Alan's tree. 2.4.9-ac14 will
apply cleanly and is at

I am not familar with the code, but either apm.c needs to wrap its sysrq
calls with ifdefs or the sysrq code needs to optimize away via defines
its various sysrq functions if it is not enabled.
The maintainer (Crutcher?) should see this.
