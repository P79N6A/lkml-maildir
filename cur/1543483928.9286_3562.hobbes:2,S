Since installing 2.2.1, I am having a strange problem.
I have the glibc2 version of Communicator 4.5 and when I hit the "new
msg" button in the Messenger, it freezes and must be kill -9'd.  It is
strange to me that there have been no updates to 4.5 since the initial
release in October..
Is anyone else having this problem?  I'm on Red Hat 5.2, BTW, nothing
fancy.
Mark
