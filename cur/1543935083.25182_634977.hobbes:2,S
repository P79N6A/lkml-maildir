what seems to happen (and this is based on seeing this on my own devel laptop, as well
as several other reports; Mark is by far not the only one) is something hardware
related, it's been seen on lots of different kernel versions.
It seems to mostly (but not 100%) happen with TI cardbus bridges, where for some reason,
once the yenta driver is loaded (unloading it later makes no difference), once in a while
we get into a mode where the CPU always immediately goes out of the C-state again.
On a hardware level, there are only a few things that cause a CPU to exit a C-state,
and one of them is a pending interrupt of some kind, which is the most likely thing going on here;
some device or apic being stuck with interrupt high, but somehow the CPU isn't actually
seeing the interrupt itself (or has it blocked!)
To call this a 2.6.24 regression is a mistake (as I've said before), it's not new to .24
by any means.
