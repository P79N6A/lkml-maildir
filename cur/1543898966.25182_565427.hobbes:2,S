Under certain loads HT can reduce performance, I have had serious
performance problems on windows terminal servers with HT enabled, and
I now disable it on all servers, no matter what OS they run.
Why?

I cant offer any advice there, but is raid-5 really the best choice
for your needs? I would not choose raid-5 for a system that is
regularly performing lots of large writes at the same time, dont
forget that each write can require several reads to recalculate the
partity.
Does the raid card have much cache ram?
If you can afford to loose some space raid-10 would probably perform better.
