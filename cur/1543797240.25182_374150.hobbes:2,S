If you can figure out a way to detect this please share.
The ACPI designers unfortunately didn't think that far
(they did it right for memory hotplug, but not for CPU) 
I invented an ACPI extensin for it, but it's non standard
so the half of CPUs is used as a default unless overwritten
(additional_cpus=NUM) 
Anyways I changed it earlier to 1 additional CPU by default.

It is a big improvement in fact. Previously with NR_CPUS==128 
(default on some distros) and CPU_HOTPLUG enabled it would
always allocate several hundred KB of just standard 
per cpu data unnecessarily.
