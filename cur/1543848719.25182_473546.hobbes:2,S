Currently I'm using ETH_P_ALL on the socket call. If I understand your proposal correctly you suggest to pass 0 on the socket call, so dev_add_pack is not called, and afterwards use a sockaddr_ll with bind to set the sll_protocol to whatever value (ETH_P_ALL in my case). Correct?

Ok, I see... I guess if mmap has not been issued by the time setsockopt is called then po->mapped == 0 and the code you point out is triggered, specifically skb_queue_purge.
> How did you verify that the receive queue still contains packets?
You are totally right! non-block recv to the descriptor returns EAGAIN, so the queues are empty. After further instrumentation of the ring code, I'm suspecting of an issue with the ring read index at the user-space app...
Nevertheless the whole ring communication between kernel and user-space seems to be based on marking pkts via a flag in each pkt slot in the ring (tp_status). I guess it works fine because the assignments are atomic (like the one on af_packet.c:671). Correct?
BTW what's the purpose of mb() and why is it exactly needed in that position in the code?
Thx again!
Salu2,
