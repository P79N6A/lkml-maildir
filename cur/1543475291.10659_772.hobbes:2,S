   Is this change intentional?  Should I fix my application, or does the
   kernel need fixing?
Your application needs to be fixed, it should sink all read data
remaining on the socket before closing.  If data is unread, TCP does
not know if this was intentional and assumes that data integrity has
been lost (because transfered bytes did not make it to the receiving
application), and thus the RST response to indicate this.
