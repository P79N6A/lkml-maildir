here's Rui's setup:
| Note: all tests were carried out running jackd -v -dalsa -dhw:0 
| -r44100 -p128 -n2 -S -P, loaded with 9 (nine) fluidsynth instances,
| on a P4@2.533Ghz laptop, against the onboard sound device

i suspect this means there was playback only, no capture, and thus the 
capture/playback interrupt interaction cannot be the case, right?
