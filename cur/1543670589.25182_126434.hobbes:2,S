Read throughput has definitely taken a hit.  I don't know why.  Perhaps
the elevator needs to have a little more relaxed definition of
contiguous requests.  Right now it only puts requests together if they
are perfectly contiguous (the first sector in one request is the next
after the last sector of another).  I'll try to test that.
Any other theories?
