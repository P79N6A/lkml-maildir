I've seen a few messages like this. Usually, the problem occurs when
some idiot sets their .forward to include a non-existant address, and
they've subscribed to some mailing list.
The problem is that the software doing the bouncing CORRECTLY replies
to the FROM address on the email it's bouncing, as that's the only
originating address it has available.
My solution is to bounce the error message to the list owner of the
mailing list I posted to that caused the bounce, and most list owners
promptly delete the offender's subscription...
Best wishes from Riley.
