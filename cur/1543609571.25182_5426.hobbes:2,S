I'm working on a game engine and there's a bug (actually, more than one
;) causing seg faults within different functions in the C/C++ libraries
(e.g. - stdlib). I installed all the development stuff from the Red Hat
CD's, do I need to get the gcc source or something in order to get these
files?
Thanks,
PGA
