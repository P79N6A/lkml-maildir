As somebody also stated, there are problems with sensors:
werewolf:~# service lm_sensors start
Loading sensors modules: 
w83781d-isa-0290: Can't access procfs/sysfs file for writing;
Run as root?
Starting sensord:                                               [  OK  ]
I _was_ root. And initscripts are run as root ?
Perhaps this is a more generic problem with sysfs :(.
TIA
