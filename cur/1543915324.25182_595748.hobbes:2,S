It seems useful to me to keep jbd_kmalloc/jbd_free. They are central
places to handle memory (de)allocation(<page size) via kmalloc/kfree, so
in the future if we need to change memory allocation in jbd(e.g. not
using kmalloc or using different flag), we don't need to touch every
place in the jbd code calling jbd_kmalloc.
