this tulip driver breaks on my dec 21041 card.  i can't get the
interface to come up.  in my logs, i see the tulip driver posting a
message about 21143 having a good link beat.  i don't have a 21143.  i
don't get any joy.  (i've posted about it in linux-kernel and
tulip-bug lists.)
fwiw version 0.89h (the driver in 2.2.13) works fine and version 0.91
(no letter) from donald becker's site, does too.  i cannot find
versions a through f, hence i am having trouble regressing to find
where it breaks.
since the site advertises that 0.91 is the stable version and that
0.91g is a development version, perhaps we should follow the hint and
use 0.91 in the stable series kernel instead?  i know we need to test
things, but is the production series the place to do it?
