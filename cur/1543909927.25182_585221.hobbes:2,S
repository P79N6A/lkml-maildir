What do I have to look for?  atomic_read after another read or write
access to the same variable, in the same function scope?  Or in the sum
of scopes of functions that could be merged by function inlining?
One example was discussed here earlier:  The for (;;) loop in
nodemgr_host_thread.  There an msleep_interruptible implicitly acted as
barrier (at the moment because it's in a different translation unit; if
it were the same, then because it hopefully has own barriers).  So that
happens to work, although such an implicit barrier is bad style:  Better
enforce the desired behaviour (== guaranteed load operation) *explicitly*.
