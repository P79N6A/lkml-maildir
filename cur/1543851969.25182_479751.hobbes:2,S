I have the rest of the patches, so you just need to resend a fixed
version of this one.  BTW see my previous response about
kmem_cache_zalloc() -- I think that's the best way to fix this.
In the future though if you can make a patch-sending script or
something that lets you avoid the attachments that would be great.
