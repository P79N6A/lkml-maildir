Valdis,
	Numerous people have had problems with the 4191 driver...me included. 
Instead of here I'd suggest going back to the NVidia site and go to the
driver download page.  There is a forum regarding the drivers and their
effects/sideeffects.  That might help shed some light on the issue.
HTH,
  Steve
