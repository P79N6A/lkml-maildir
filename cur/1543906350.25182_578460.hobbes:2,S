Some arguments against that:
  - You cannot tell a customer: Wait for the kernel in half a year.
    This is the time it at least needs until a laptop got sold, the
    problem is found, a patch is written and checked in and finally
    hits the distribution.
  - You can also not backport fixes as ACPI patches mostly have the
    potential to break other machines/BIOSes
  - There also exist the policy to not fix up/workaround totally broken
    AML BIOS implementations
  - We do not need to and never will be able to copy or do the same
    Windows is doing

What the hell is so wrong with:
Let the user override the trip points. If he does so, ignore
thermal trip point updates from BIOS. Don't care for hysteresis
BIOS implementations (these are the BIOS trip point updates).
If user changes them, it's his fault, he doesn't need to...
Make sure that trip points can only be lowered, compared to the
initially fetched one from BIOS.
This is neither confusing, nor dangerous in any way (beside the fact
that the critical trip point might get dynamically lowered by BIOS,
which is totally insane).
