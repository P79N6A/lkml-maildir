I believe there are instances where ARM fails if CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE
is not set.  Luckily we have assertions in the generated assembly to
flag these as assembly errors when they happen, rather than silently
continuing to build.
Maybe CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE should be:
	bool "..." if BROKEN || (!ARM && !SPARC64)
? 8)
Note also that the help text:
          WARNING: some versions of gcc may generate incorrect code with this
          option.  If problems are observed, a gcc upgrade may be needed.
is reversed for the situation we have with ARM.  Hence, I propose we
change this to something like:
	  WARNING: some versions of gcc may generate incorrect code if this
	  option is changed form the platform default.  If problems are
	  observed, either a gcc upgrade may be needed or alternatively
	  the platform default should be selected (=y for ARM and Sparc64,
	  n for others.)
