Yeah, but until I do, I can't even run 'make oldconfig'.
(This isn't about me - I will probably always build on Linux, with gcc
- it's about weird environments like cross-compiling from Solaris,
which I'm told was often done in the earlier stages of SPARC Linux.)
I suggest that *at least* the built-in targets should link libkconfig
statically - either via libkconfig.a or just the list of .o files.
