More precisely, "preferred source".

This is what setting the "arp_filter" sysctl on a device does
if you've setup the preferred source on your routes correctly.
If we would use that IP address to speak to the destination in
the ARP, we respond, else we do not.
I've quoted the 'arp_filter' entry in Documentation/sysctl/ip-sysctl.txt
please give it a read.
