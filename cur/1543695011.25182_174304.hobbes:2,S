2.6.0-test8 + this patch boots perfectly here:
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-260test8fb root=/dev/md3 video=matroxfb:xres:1600,yres:1360,depth:16,pixclock:4116,left:304,right:64,upper:46,lower:1,hslen:192,vslen:3,fv:90,hwcursor=off hdd=scsi atkbd_softrepeat=1
This configuration didn't boot in 2.6.0-test8-mm1 (screen stayed in
80x25 VGA mode and it crashed before the mode-switch).
HTH,
Jurriaan
