It's an API that provides *necessary* functionality for those
filesystems that wish to override the standard flock(). It was very
recently introduced by a third party, so we haven't had time to code up
an NFS flock yet.
Removing it now will just mean that we have to reintroduce it in a month
or so when NFS and the other filesystems start to catch up.
Cheers,
  Trond
