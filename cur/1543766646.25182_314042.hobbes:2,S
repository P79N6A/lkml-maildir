Ok, so for each driver we have either ->suspend & ->resume or
->change_state, ->halt and ->continue, right?
Is it safe to assume that these later methods would get called from the
same places in device_suspend and device_resume that ->suspend &
->resume are called from at the moment? That would seem to me to be the
cleanest way of addressing ordering ... but then I find myself asking,
why not just do one or the other?
I have to admit that I've never liked ->suspend & ->resume. They imply
too much knowledge in the caller about what start the device was in. I'd
like, instead, to see all of the decision making as to what state to
actually be in exist in the driver and the helpers it uses. Then the
semantics becomes requests and notifications of system/child/parent
state changes rather than _commands_ to suspend/resume. This should be a
lot cleaner in the context of runtime power management as well.

Now you're confusing me...
if (driver->suspend | driver->resume)
	driver->suspend|resume
elseif (driver->change_state)
	driver->change_state
elseif (driver->halt | driver->continue)
	driver->halt|continue
else
	printk("Urgh. No driver power management methods for %s.\n");

I do like this idea. Especially if we can say "I'm rebooting rather than
powering off."

That looks like a good idea too. But it also sounds like an abuse of
suspend|resume. Perhaps it implies the need/desire for more genericness
to pm_message_t (sounds familiar!).
