The length of the runqueue isn't really the issue, if you have a lot of
interractive processes they may only run a ms or less each. My suggestion
is that the time between dispatches (time spent waiting on the runqueue)
was a better indicator, and that timeslices could be sized based on how
long a process waited for a CPU. And ordering would also be subject to
priority effects, of course.
My thought is that this would tune the system based on current overall
behaviour, and also adjust for CPU clock speed changes, not as rare as
they once were.
