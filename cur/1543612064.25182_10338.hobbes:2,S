Yes, from a CS point of view. 
But practically cramfs is created once to contain some kind of
ROM for embedded devices. So if we never modify these data again,
why not creating it in the required byte order? 
Why wasting kernel cycles for le<->be conversion? Just because
it's more general? For writable general purpose file systems it
makes sense, but to none of romfs, cramfs etc.
So I would prefer the given patch.
