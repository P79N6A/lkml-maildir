Subject: vhangup when the console is serial

  I'm experiencing a problem on an embedded system with 2.4.23-pre2 or
later, and in 2.4.22-ac4. The system has a serial console, and I see a
call to the driver's hangup routine in the middle of the login sequence
(after login:, before password:).
  I've traced this to do_tty_hangup() (called from sys_vhangup), and I
see
that it attempts to avoid calling the driver's hangup() routine for the
console device. The test for the console doesn't account for serial
console.
  A change like the one below resolves this problem for me. However, I
don't understand why the problem doesn't occur on earlier kernels. I
hope someone more familiar with this code can comment on it.
  I've searched the archives of this list for any discussion of this
problem, without any luck. I am not subscribed to this list, and would
appreciate being CC-ed on any replies.
thanks,
