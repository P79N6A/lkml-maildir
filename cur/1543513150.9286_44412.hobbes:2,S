Your vendor made a mistake. They shipped the wrong binary. They picked
wrong compile options - but its a beta thats why you put betas out - to
find bugs.

This may be true for the Alpha cases because unlike FPU you probably don't
get clusters of byte operations.

Which is a text book reason for putting emulation in user space.
