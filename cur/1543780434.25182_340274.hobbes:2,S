The "dev->current_state = 4" is what prompted the ">= D3hot" in the
first place... :-)
I had seen a patch from earlier this year that changed the probing
code to actually get the power state from the device (and added a
pci_get_power_state API).  I don't know why that never got merged,
but since it didn't I had to account for the case of the power state
being unknown (i.e dev->current_state == 4).
So, w/ Dave's patch for Sparc64 to use setup-res.c, does the patch
stay?  Is there anything else I need to do?
Thanks,
John
