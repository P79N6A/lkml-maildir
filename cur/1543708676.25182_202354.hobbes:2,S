John,
This is the other place I found "start_time" being used.  It is at about line 
340 in kernel/acct.c.  The same sort of math should be done here:
	elapsed = get_jiffies_64() - current->start_time;
	ac.ac_etime = encode_comp_t(elapsed < (unsigned long) -1l ?
	                       (unsigned long) elapsed : (unsigned long) -1l);
	do_div(elapsed, HZ);
-g
