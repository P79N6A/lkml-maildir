Most criminals are dumb. That means a boot screen that says 
"Property of Dave Miller, if found please leave anywhere in Tahoe"
"Password:"
and a boot/bios password will defeat them and may get the laptop dumped
back where it can be recovered.
Thus don't rule out the value of the deterrent It isnt appropriate if
you leave national secrets on the train like all our finest government
employees keep doing obviously.

This threat level is why secure systems people use smartcards for the
encryption keys and related processing. Just don't leave the smartcard
on the train!
