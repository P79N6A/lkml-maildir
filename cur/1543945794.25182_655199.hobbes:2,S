I've been seeing similar attempts to map 0xf0 but so far I was the only
one (although that made no sense to me). Does the patch below help at
all? The problem seems to be that the kernel is trying to map pages at
0xf0000 but these are not reserved in the guest E820 map so they could
contain a page table page etc.
A useful tip for getting a backtrace out of a crashed Xen guest is to
set "on_crash=preserve" in your domain config. Then once the crash has
happened you can use "/usr/lib/xen/bin/xenctx -s System.map <domid>"
where System.map is the guest kernel System.map.
