I spent some time thinking about this one.  The original code is ok if
led_out is always either 0x01 or 0x00.  But what if it is eg 0xc0?  Then
the negation amounts to the negation of a nonzero number, so the result is
0.  So the result of the bit and is 0.  So the last bit is not flipped.
But I don't know what is the range of led_out.  If it is always 1 or 0,
then why bother with the bit and?
