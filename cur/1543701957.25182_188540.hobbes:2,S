Here's an updated version against 2.6.1-rc1.  Small comment fix (there 
are actually up to (MAX_NUMNODES * MAX_NR_ZONES) possible zones total, 
not log2(MAX_NUMNODES * MAX_NR_ZONES) as your comment stated.  That is 
the number of bits necessary to index every possible zone.
After this goes in, we (I) can convert a number of places that are doing 
several pointer dereferences/arithmetic and other things to determine 
which node/zone a page belongs to simply calling 
page_nodenum()/page_zonenum().
Cheers!
