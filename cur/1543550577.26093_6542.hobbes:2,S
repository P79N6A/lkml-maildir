Hi Petkan,
Thanks for your comment.

Since I don't explictly sleep anywhere, I'm not sure which code fragment
would be useful... (net_tx_action is part of the networking layers). Which
network functions can sleep (netif_rx, netif_stop_queue, netif_wake_queue,
...) ?
After reading the softnet HOWTO, and some of the network drivers, I
was unsure about the netif_stop_queue and netif_wake_queue functions. The
howto indicated that these two should be protected from concurrent
execution by a private lock. Not all the drivers seem to do this. In my
case (although I'm running UP at the moment), I've used a driver global
spinlock, for example:
  spinlock_t driver_lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;
  int scc72_hard_xmit (struct sk_buff *skb, struct net_device *dev) 
  {  
    unsigned long flags;
    /* ... */
  
    spin_lock_irqsave (&driver_lock, flags);
    netif_stop_queue (dev);
    spin_unlock_irqrestore (&driver_lock, flags);
    /* ... */ 
  }
  /* Example timer callback, to wake the queue */
  void scc72_interframewait (unsigned long channel)
  {
    unsigned long flags;
    struct scc72_channel *scc = (struct scc72_channel *) channel;
    /* ... */
    spin_lock_irqsave (&driver_lock, flags);
    /* ... */
 
    if (netif_queue_stopped (scc->dev))
      netif_wake_queue (scc->dev);
    spin_unlock_irqrestore (&driver_lock, flags);
  }
I've just checked my driver, and below is the list of all the external
functions called. Any idea which of these could be trying to sleep?
  dev_kfree_skb_any     (called from both hard IRQ and non IRQ context)
  dev_alloc_skb         (called from both hard IRQ and non IRQ context)
  del_timer             (called from both hard IRQ and non IRQ context)
  add_timer             (called from both hard IRQ and non IRQ context)
  netif_rx              (called from IRQ context) 
  netif_start_queue     (called from non hard IRQ context, ex: dev_open)
  netif_stop_queue      (called from non hard IRQ context, ex: hard_start_xmit)
  netif_wake_queue      (called from non hard IRQ context, ex: timer callbacks)
  netif_queue_stopped   (called from non hard IRQ context, ex: timer callbacks)
  skb_queue_tail        (called from non hard IRQ context, ex: hard_start_xmit)
  skb_dequeue           (called from both hard IRQ and non IRQ context)
  skb_queue_head_init   (called from non hard IRQ context, ex: dev_open)
and the standard functions dev_init_buffers, register_netdevice, 
   copy_from_user, unregister_netdev, etc. called in the standard places.
skb_queue_tail, skb_dequeue and skb_queue_head_init are used to manage
an internal queue of outgoing skb's.
Thanks.
