I've been using 2.96 for the last couple of kernel compiles, and it's
been working fine (pasting warnings and all).  This is the 2nd-to-latest
update from RH 7.0.  The only issue I have is the very occasional Signal
11--but I had those with kgcc, as well, so I don't reckon those are
compiler-related.
Right now, I have test12.  This is on my desktop machine, doing normal
desktop stuff (finances, StarOffice, Netscape, Java development, etc). 
Seems to be working well, and test12 runs *much* faster than previous
kernels...
