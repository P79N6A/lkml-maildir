Umm... That assumes that we actually can keep state.  Neither /proc/mounts
nor /proc/ksyms can do that (well, /proc/mounts can - at the price of really
dirty trick; we can insert a dummy element into vfsmntlist and use it as a
cursor, but I'd rather Not Go There(tm)).
However, having ->seek() (with default being a loop) makes sense.  I'll
play with that area and try to get a decent API - I understand what you
want, but there are several other issues I'd like to deal with.  I suspect
that ->start() semantics needs to be changed a bit...
