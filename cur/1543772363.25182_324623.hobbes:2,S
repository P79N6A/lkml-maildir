Well, as a dude that hangs with the LynxOS engineering staff in cubicals
next to me, I can say that development here is really no different than
any other kernel community that I've run into, open or closed. We're all
kernel engineers except with maybe a difference in emphasis on what is
important at any given time.

But it already has. This RT group doesn't need the whole community to jump
on it. We can do it ourselves and submit the changes to an upstream trees
where relevant.

Yeah, but that's just you and folks that have been friendly to this effort.
The rest is another story altogether.
