But that local or global allocation policy depends on what task is 
accessing the data at what time. A simple grep should not result in 
interleaving. A big application accessing the same data from multiple 
processes should have interleaving for shared data. Both may not be active 
at the same time.

Well these weird effects are then at least expected since there was a 
cpuset set up for applications to activate this effect and the 
processes running in that cpuset will behave in the weird way we want.
The mountpoint option means that reading the contents of a file in some 
filesystems is slower than in others because some files spread their pages 
all over the system while others are node local. Again if the process is 
single threaded the node local is always the right approach. These single 
threaded processes will no longer be able to run with full pagecache 
speed. Memory will be used in other nodes that may have been reserved for 
other purposes by the user.
