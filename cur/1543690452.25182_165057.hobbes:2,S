My understanding is that it will never be fixed on the K7 (current Athlons),
And these will be with us for a long time; more or less forever, just like
the f00f bug :-)
I would agree with you if the patch had some bad impact on common
paths, but I don't think that's the case here. It merely adds a cheap check
to an already slow path.
On the other hand the errata is so unlikely that I doubt it will be frequently
hit anyways. 2.6 kernel hitting it was just very very unlucky, and it
only did so very infrequently.
Just to fix the kernel we could have chosen a different workaround, like
adding an exception table entry to each prefetch and jumping back
(I did that on the x86-64 port originally). But this way is also not that bad
and it fixes hypothetical user space programs that could maybe hit it too.
Of course they may want to also fix it in a different way to run on older
kernels (e.g. handling the signal in user space or avoiding the conditions).
But doing it centrally in the kernel is a bit cleaner and at some point
people have to update their kernels anyways.
