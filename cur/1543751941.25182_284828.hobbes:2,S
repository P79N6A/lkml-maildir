Subject: Kernel panic Attempted to kill init while intercepting close syscall

Hello linux-experts,
    I am intercepting syscall in kernel 2.4.28. While,
I was intercepting close() syscall, I got the
following message:
   Kernel panic: Attempted to kill init !
  I have also attached the code here. What could be
the problem? I am storing files opened in a hash table
and then while a particular file descriptor is closed,
I am calling find_pipe_fd to clean the associated
structure in my hash table.
Thanks,
selva
----------------
void find_pipe_fd(unsigned int fd)
{
	unsigned long tfd, tinode, hashkey;
	unsigned int taccess;
	struct list_head *p, *taskp;
	struct resource *my;
	struct my_process *my_task;
	tfd = (long) fd;
	tinode = getinode(tfd);
	taccess = READACCESS;
	//Evaluate for read access resource descriptor
	hashkey = eval_hashkey(tfd, tinode, taccess);
	printk("\nHash key evaluated..[%ld]",hashkey);
        /* Clean the memory using kmalloc */
}
static int my_sys_close(unsigned int fd)
{
	int ret,err;
	unsigned int tfd = fd;
	MOD_INC_USE_COUNT;
	ret = sys_close_saved(tfd);
	/*Upon successful close find and delete the file
descriptor resource from the hash table */
	
	if (ret == 0)
		find_pipe_fd(tfd);
	
	MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT;
	return ret;
}
