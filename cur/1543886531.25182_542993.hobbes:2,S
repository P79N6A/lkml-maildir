I need to fix this up a bit. I'll point out the issues in the sequel.
So now quicklist semantics vs. TLB flushing are the motive behind the
odd flush_tlb_mm() affair. The real trick with it is that flushing
must never occur until the TLB flush. Any change to the core quicklist
code that retires pages back to the page allocator earlier (e.g. based
on some limit) will break things badly.

This is wrong; pgd's are smaller than PAGE_SIZE on PAE. Burning lowmem
like this is very, very bad for such systems. pmd_cache is rather
trivial to convert to quicklists, since all it does is zero pages. I
still don't approve of even the !SHARED_KERNEL_PMD case using PAGE_SIZE
-sized pgd's. Xen should really be fixed to avoid requiring guests to
have recursive pagetables or whatever it's doing.

This comment deletion is bogus, as the locking scheme has not changed.
