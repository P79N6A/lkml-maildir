I'm running a patch on one of my computers right now that introduces a
new design for kernel timekeeping.  Right now, one of the main problems
is that we use the 8253 counter 0 for coarse timing, and the TSC for
fine timing -- keeping the two accurately synchronized is not easy, and
probably not possible in practice using the current method.
The patch I've written modularizes the timers, and eliminates the counter
0 dependency.  	It also makes lost_ticks irrelevant.  I'd like to use a
ntp-like PLL to synchronize the TSC to the 8253 timer in the case where
there is no external timing source.  Synchronizing to the RTC is another
good option.
The patch is a little bit rough right now, since it doesn't synchronize
to anything, thus the kernel time diverges due to the inaccuracy of cpu_hz.
It's obviously not a 2.4 thing, but I'd like to see it added to 2.5.
Right now, I either need to learn more about NTP, or find an NTP expert.
