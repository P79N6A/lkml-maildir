Hi,
the answer is a bit complex; I'll try to break it down in steps ...
step 1) the text database as used by lspci
This is quite easy, just go to 
http://pciids.sourceforge.net/
 and add
your pci ids to the database
step 2) the drivers
this is a bit more work, basically this is about teaching individual
drivers that support your hardware about your new IDs.
for example the i810-like audio driver has a table like this:
 static struct pci_device_id snd_intel8x0_ids[] __devinitdata = {
        { 0x8086, 0x2415, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, DEVICE_INTEL }, /* 82801AA */
        { 0x8086, 0x2425, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, DEVICE_INTEL }, /* 82901AB */
        { 0x8086, 0x2445, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, DEVICE_INTEL }, /* 82801BA */
        { 0x8086, 0x2485, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, DEVICE_INTEL }, /* ICH3 */
if your hw is compatible, just add your ID, test the new river (since
you have the hardware) and send a patch to the driver mainter and/or the
lkml mailing list
Does this answer your question?
Greetings,
