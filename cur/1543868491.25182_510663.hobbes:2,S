First of all, you are writing kernel code for programmers, not end-users.
Secondly, and this is a big issue, you haven't specified which "units"
are exporting interfaces that will be used outside of UBI, and which
are being used only internally inside UBI.  Interfaces which will be
used outside of UBI have to be carefully controlled.  Interfaces only
used inside UBI are private interfaces which can be easily changed.
Also, if you are going to use this horrible, theoretical, pendantic
Computer Science coding stlye, at the very least you should have
included a module dependency diagram so it was easy to understand what
the heck was going on.  This would make it easier to make specific
suggestions, because after I looked at it for a while, I decided it
was too hard to figure out the overall architecture, and not worth my
time, and so I gave up on the review.  Not that my opinion is the only
one you need to pay attention to, but if everyone is telling you that
need to simplify the number of interfaces, you may want to listen
since your code is going to need adequate review if you want to get it
into mainline.
