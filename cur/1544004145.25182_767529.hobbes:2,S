Oops, I am wrong (after a small investigation).
"1490 Any atomic operation that modifies some state in memory and
returns information
1491 about the state (old or new) implies an SMP-conditional general
memory barrier
1492 (smp_mb()) on each side of the actual operation (with the exception of
1493 explicit lock operations, described later).  These include:
1494
...
1503         atomic_dec_and_test();"
Won't fix the problem at hand, but maybe something like this would be
nice for future generations :-)
