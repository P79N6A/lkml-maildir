I just want to rectify a detail: local_t uses type "long", which is 32
bits on x86_32 and 64 bits on x86_64.
Using a cmpxchg8b on i386 seems to require the LOCK prefix to be taken,
so it may degrate performances too much. Therefore, you may prefer to
stay with cli/sti on i386, but using a local cmpxchg would make sense on
x86_64.
A side-note: I really dislike the new cmpxchg behavior when a too
large value is passed to it. If we pass a uint64_t * as first argument
to cmpxchg or cmpxchg_local on i386, it just fails silently. Before, a
linker error was produced, which required the kernel to be compiled with
-O2 as side-effect, but at least there wasn't any silent failure...
