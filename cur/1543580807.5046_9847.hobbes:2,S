I suspect it is a reiserfs problem, and that you are using lilo older than
21.6.  Are you mounting /boot with -o notail?
Regardless, I'm willing to bet upgrading to lilo 21.6 will solve this.  It
calls an ioctl reiserfs provides to unpack small files, and I've seen it
fix this exact problem on one of my devel boxes (no lilo prompt, append
lines in lilo.conf ignored).
