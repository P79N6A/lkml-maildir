Ah. I see. In the call itself. Sneaky :)
Would you consider modifying that bit so it doesn't confuse others in the 
future?
Oh, and while we're on the topic, if only part of a page is NVS, what's the 
right behaviour? My e820 table has:
BIOS-e820: 000000003dff0000 - 000000003dffffc0 (ACPI data)
BIOS-e820: 000000003dffffc0 - 000000003e000000 (ACPI NVS)
