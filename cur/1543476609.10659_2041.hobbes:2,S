Hi!
I'm using an 2.0.36 kernel on a RH5.x distribution.
Now I'm getting the following curious state, without explicable causes
(say a big process terminating):
[andreas@lifesaver andreas]$ uptime
  8:08pm  up 18 days, 18:23, 30 users,  load average: 0.18, 0.16, 0.10
[andreas@lifesaver andreas]$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        126532      69404      57128      13264       7384       7868
-/+ buffers/cache:      54152      72380
Swap:       128516      49404      79112
[andreas@lifesaver andreas]$ uname -a
Linux lifesaver.mtg.co.at 2.0.36 #3 Sun Dec 20 16:06:19 CET 1998 i586 unknown
The box at the same time starts to swap very activly, as far as to freeze
my XFree mousepointer for some time.
swapoff/swapon help the situation for some time, but afterwards the same
state returns.
