The idea was that people who have multi-IO cards but don't know what
modules are can have things Just Work: parport_serial gets loaded
automagically and detects their cards for them.  But yes, the flip
side is that people who _don't_ have multi-IO cards are going to get
that error.
There are three ways out, I think:
- change parport_pc so that it doesn't request parport_serial at
  init.  In this case, how will parport_serial get loaded at all?
  Perhaps with some recommended /etc/modules.conf lines (perhaps
  parport_lowlevel{1,2,3,...})?
- people who get the error and don't like it can put 'alias
  parport_serial off' in /etc/modules.conf.  Not especially pleasant,
  I guess.
- parport_serial could be made to initialise successfully even if it
  doesn't see any devices that it can drive.
What do people think?
Tim.
