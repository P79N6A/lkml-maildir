It still has trouble with the x/gforce vs two niced encoders scenario.
The previously reported choppiness is still present.  
I suspect that x/gforce landing in the expired array is the trouble, and
that this will never be smooth without some kind of exemption.  I added
some targeted unfairness to .30, and it didn't help much at all.
Priorities going all the way to 1 were a surprise.
