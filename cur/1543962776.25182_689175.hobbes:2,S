Yes.

I agree. Got confused/uneasy about the difference myself looking at the 
dynamic code.

It does. Ofcourse, you can than also not reuse _UNSET resources as you did 
previously but that's for the best anyway.
In trying to come up with problems I'm only finding a difference in an added 
failure mode with respect to the static array if we run out of memory at a 
bad time and this is quite unserious.
Yes, I'd say to just do that. It might appear a bit clumsy from an 
implementation standpoint but the only thing this stuff should be doing is 
enable inane amounts of possible resources for one device without forcing 
them on all.
