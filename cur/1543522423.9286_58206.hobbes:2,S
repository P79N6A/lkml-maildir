Does anyone know if you have to call free_bootmem() for mem
obtained via alloc_bootmem() or does the kernel's call to
free_all_bootmem() do this for you?  I noted that something
simple like:
bmem_test() {
	p=alloc_bootmem(SIZE);
	free_bootmem(p, SIZE)
}
__setup(test, bmem_test);
even fails to work.  I ask because I was trying to use the bootmem 
interface (to temporarily store the ether= info supplied at boot until 
the dev layer is ready to use it) and everything works fine until I 
try to free_bootmem() which triggers a BUG() in bootmem.c at 102.
Line 102 of bootmem.c is in free_bootmem_core:
        if (end > bdata->node_low_pfn)
                BUG();
 
Unfortunately there arent (m)any other users of the bootmem stuff that
I can use to compare to/learn from.
Paul.
