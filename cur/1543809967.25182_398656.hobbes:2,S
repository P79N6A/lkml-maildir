Greg - related to this I have thought a bit on __devinit versus __init.
With HOTPLUG enabled __devinit becomes empty and thus violate any checks
for illegal references to .init.text.
Would it make sense to create a specific set of sections for __devinit
and frinds so we could check that __devinit sections are not referenced from .text.
This is another way to do the current __init checks but with HOTPLUG
enabled and I like the result to be consistent with and without HOTPLUG
enabled.
Also I see __devinit being used in different ways. See sound/oss/mad16
for instance.
Only a few functions are marked __devinit nad I wonder if any should be
marked __devinit at all in that file. But due to references to
__initdata current checks discovered a potential bug here already today.
