Linus & the gang,
I got another oops tonight. The dysfunctional SCSI drive has been removed,
so I guess it's not a suspect. Sorry, I didn't get the oops, it was larger
than my screen and KMSGDUMP hasn't been working so far.
The new kernel that I am currently running has MTRR support and the coma
bug workarround disabled. If I have any more oopsen, I'll let you know and
go back to 2.2.1 and see if that fixes it (unless anyone has any other
ideas).
Thanks.
