Distro's are struggling to catch up with the flood of new drivers since 2.6.18rc that 
support these new chipsets.
You'll probably install just fine on IDE first and switch to a manually compiled kernel 
(2.6.18 recommended) afterwards. Once the distro's catch up you'll have forgotten all 
the pain :)
