Solaris (and possibly the upcoming BSD threads support)
will map threads onto kernel threads as needed. Provides
better scaling. But it's really a glibc issue. LinuxThreads
author Xavier Leroy (I think) decided to do a 1:1 mapping.
LinuxThreads became the glibc pthreads implementation.
End of story.
Standardized light weight threads would be nice. Does the 
kernel evenhave to provide any additional support to make 
them possible? Or can the glibc guys just bang them out?
