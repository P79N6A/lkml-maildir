I just want to let people know that IEEE 1394 development is going on
rapidly. I have made a patch available at the project's homepage
http://eclipt.uni-klu.ac.at/ieee1394
that reflects the current status (Code is from Andreas Bombe, Sebastien
Rougeaux and me). That effectively means, my codebase was merged with
Andreas', I used my university holidays also for the raw device and 
Sebastien came quite far in a short time with the OHCI driver.
* New core module
* Texas Instruments PCI-Lynx driver
* Adaptec AIC-5800 driver
* OHCI (Open Host Controller Interface)
* RAW 1394 I/O driver
From this website you can also download a user-space library which allows
communication via the raw device.
Note that this patch compiles when applied to 2.2.10. But that's the only
thing that's sure here :-) 
It's still developer-only!
Best regards,
Emanuel
