Hi there.

I can't comment on the original S3 ViRGE as I've never had one, but
neither the S3 ViRGE/DX nor the S3 ViRGE/GX cards have ever caused me
any problems, so don't mix them up...

Also, it wasn't me having the problem, but the person I was replying
to - you've basically echoed what I said...
Best wishes from Riley.
