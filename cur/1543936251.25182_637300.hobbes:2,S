Anyone remember the patch / patches done for the 2.6 series that related 
to top reporting > 100% CPU usage?
I remember there was a series of patches addressing several clock 
related issues; but, don't remember the exact one for this issue.
I'm going to have to get a memory upgrade and stop putting useful 
tidbits in temporary storage!
