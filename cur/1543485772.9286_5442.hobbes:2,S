Andreas, I had tested it only on 5.6 and there it gives the same result on
(a) NFS, (b) tmpfs, (c) local disk (UFS). Moreover, from the manpage for
rmdir(2) from 5.5.1:
rmdir(2)                                                 rmdir(2)
NAME
       rmdir - remove a directory
[snip]
ERRORS
       The named directory is removed unless one or more  of  the
       following are true:
[snip]
       EINVAL              The  directory  to  be  removed is the
                           current directory.
       EINVAL              The final component of path is  ``.''.
[snip]
                            4 Dec 1991                          2
So that actually predates 5.5.
