Actually, it turns out I'm really not well positioned to do this,
because the ia64 agp patch for 2.4 looks very different from the 2.5
and your tree looks rather different from the DRM stuff that's in the
official Linux tree (correct me if I'm wrong here).
Anyhow, this should get you close to compiling (and working,
hopefully), modulo vmap/vunmap:
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2,5,0)
# define pte_offset_kernel(dir, address)	pte_offset(dir, address)
# define pte_pfn(pte)				(pte_page(pte) - mem_map)
# define flush_tlb_kernel_range(s,e)		flush_tlb_all()
#endif
The above definition of pte_pfn() is not truly platform-independent,
but I believe it works on all platforms that support AGP.  The problem
is that we can't just use page_address(), because the physical address
in the PTE may not be a valid memory address (it could be an I/O
address).
