The 4giga-patch should be included into the next 2.3.x releases. In the
meantime you can download it from my ftp area, it's against 2.3.15-pre1:
	
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/andrea/kernel-patches/pending-2.3.x/bigmem-2.3.15-pre1-P
You only need to apply it, set CONFIG_BIGMEM to y, recompile and reboot ;).
