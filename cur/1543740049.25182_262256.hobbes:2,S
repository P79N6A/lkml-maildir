Hrm... Okay, maybe, but I'd rather keep it disabled for now on ppc and
ppc64, there is simply no case there where the interrupt informations
are incorrect :) And the way PCMCIA uses it is a bit nasty imho, besides
the current interface passing in a mask isn't really useable when your
max interrupt number goes beyond the size of a long.
Note that the reason why it dies on ppc atm is that it calls the irq
desc functions like shutdown() without testing if they exist in the
first place...
Looking at the code, it seems that I need to add startup() & shutdown()
callbacks to all my irq controllers so they do the equivalent of enable
and disable at least ...
Ben.
