Like you said, not all debugging aids should be merged. I don't think
function and line number is enough an argument to justify putting your
own printk() in. That's my thinking anyway.

Do you really need it? Wouldn't it be better if you figured out which
debug printk() statements make sense and leave those in with KERN_DEBUG?
