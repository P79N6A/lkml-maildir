I am not sure how to classify this bug properly. 
First, the driver correctly follows the behaviour described by Greg KH: it
should load successfully even if there is no corresonding hardware. Then
(in already-loaded state) it should generate hotplug events when the
hardware says it's present (and that's slow). Greg KH says that in hotplug
world (i.e., in reality) nothing else is possible. From this viewpoint, the
bug is in the linuxrc script provided by RedHat. It should really either
poll and sleep and wait or use udev to get notification when the disk is
really accessible.
Second, a similar problem has been discussed on LKML in September, under the
title "udev is too slow creating devices". While originally concerned with
asynchronicity due to udev itself, this therad also touches the idea that
udev doesn't really add asynchronicity, since PCI devices are really
hot-pluggable and the bus is already asynchronous. The thread starts here:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/9/14/298
and continues here:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/9/18/89
In this thread, there were the following words by Benjamin Herrenschmidt:

However, we _do_ need this synchronicity, and therefore _have_ to live with
major bloatage either in the kernel (currently that's not there) or in the
userspace (your "sleep for a magic number of seconds" here and there in
linuxrc and bootscripts). My opinion is that the needed userspace bloatage
is not centralized, also it's hard to audit, and therefore the issue of
supporting the statement "This piece of hardware must be there, it's not
really hotpluggable" must be dealt with.
P.S.: FreeBSD explicitly sleeps 15 seconds for SCSI devices to settle.
