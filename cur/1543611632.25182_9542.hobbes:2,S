If you want a high quality, tested supported kernel which has been through
extensive QA then use kernel for a reputable vendor, or do the QA work
yourself or with other people. We have kernel janitors, so why not kernel QA
projects ?
However you'll need a lot of time, a lot of hardware and a lot of attention
to procedure
