I am trying to make use of the usbfs USBDEVFS_DISCONNECT ioctl, and
I am failing. Here is the code:
  struct usb_device *dev;
  [...]
  sprintf(path, "/proc/bus/usb/%s/%s", dev->bus->dirname, dev->filename);
  int fd = open(path);
  struct usbdevfs_ioctl command = { 0, USBDEVFS_DISCONNECT, 0 };
  ioctl (fd, USBDEVFS_IOCTL, &command) < 0
However, the ioctl always fails. I am not sure whether I am using
the right values for the file descriptor passed to ioctl(), or what
the interface number (first parameter of usbdevfs_ioctl) is.
Maybe someone could offer me some advice or tell me to RTFM (but
please specify TM to FR).
Thanks,
