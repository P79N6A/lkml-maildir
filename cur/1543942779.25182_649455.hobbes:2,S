Nope.
But I tested it on mainline, and mainline exhibits the never-powers-off
symptom, whereas ed50d6cbc394cd0966469d3e249353c9dd1d38b9 demonstrates the
powers-off-after-20-seconds symptom.  
So we _may_ be dealing with two bugs here, and your patch might have fixed
the first, but that success is obscured by the second.  I guess I need to
prepare a tree which has ed50d6cbc394cd0966469d3e249353c9dd1d38b9 at its
tip.  (Wonders how to do that).  
btw, mainline (plus this patch, not that it changed anything) prints
<stopping disk stuff>
Disabling non-boot CPUs
CPU 1 is now offline
and that's it.   This machine has eight cpus.  Might be a hint?
