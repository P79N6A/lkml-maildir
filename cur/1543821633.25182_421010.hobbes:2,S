Just for completeness, windows vista will include a enhanced prefetcher
called (sic) SuperFetch. The idea behind it seems to be to analyze I/O
patterns and then "mirror" the most frequently used disk blocks into
the USB flash drive; so if when the usb flash drive is plugged in
the system will read those blocks from it as it was the hard drive
the next time you run the app
