this is my experience with my brothers laptop, its an asus, i cant
remember model off hand, it has a sempron 3000+ cpu, and some sis
chipset.
i installed linux on it due to him having excessive windows problems..
the xorg log told me i couldnt get dri, because of some hardware
problem, then it gave me a link, which i cant remember either, which
explained much more in detail about this.. and the thing about the video
overlay i do remember, it was something about some shared memory it uses
for the card which made the video overlay not work good, in both windows
and linux as far as i remember.. and it was true, video did sometimes
stutter and such.. and there is no dri..
i will contact my brother to get some more info..
