You may be able to use the third argument to the signal handler:
given a handler declared as (int n, siginfo_t *info,struct ucontext *context),
look at context->uc_mcontext.sc_traparg_a0 
SBCL has been doing this for a few months now and nobody has yet
complained that it's broken for them.  Look for arch_get_bad_addr
