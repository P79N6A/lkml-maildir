Why not just WARN if it is already blocked as well? Presumably if the
driver needs nested blocking, it is going to have to carry some state
to know when to do the final unblock anyway, so it may as well just
not do these redundant blocks either.
** or ** just do a counting block/unblock to properly support nesting
them. That is, go one way or the other, and do it properly.
