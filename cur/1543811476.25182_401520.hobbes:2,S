As Ryan observes in his bug, the keyboard and mouse were both plugged into the 
ps2 ports.  Same keyboard, both amd64, both with both the mouse and keyboard 
plugged into the ps2 ports, both with a dead keyboard before rc1. As he says, 
evidence suggests it is indeed the same bug.  Also, we're both on Gentoo, but 
that could simply be due to the fact that Gentoo folks are probably more 
likely to be running rc or even git kernels than most, due to the type of 
distribution it is and GregKH's recently adding mainline git snapshots to the 
package tree to encourage quicker testing.
One discrepancy so far: Ryan mentions git10, implying it failed for him, while 
git10 works here but git11 fails.  My guess is that the USB error he 
originally keyed in on, that turned out to be happening with working kernels 
too, sent him down the wrong path, and git10 will end up working for him.  
Either that or the root issue is something that changed in git10, and then 
again in git11, killing his one day and mine the next, due to the mobo 
differences or something.
