I didn't realise you were assuming UP, sorry.  On SMP there are N values
of `current' and up to N user-mode tasks executing simultaneously.

A reasonable, though never guaranteed assumption.  It particularly tends
to fail under memory pressure if the shared memory is pageable: even
soft faults can take a relatively long time.

This is the case for user space SMP.  Each processor is executing a
different user process, at the same time.  So instruction-by-instruction
effects are important.  The sharing can be due to explicit shared
memory, or good old threads.

And if the atomicity is extended to SMP-atomicity, i.e. by using the
lock prefix, that same code works on SMP systems too.
