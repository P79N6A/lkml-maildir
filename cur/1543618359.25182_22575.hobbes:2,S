Richard,  that's just completely over the top.  Antti is quite
justified in reporting a problem against the stable kernel,
particularly when it has a version number as late as 2.4.17.
We want *more* bug reports, not less.  And if some of them
are dupes, then we should just roll with it and be polite.
It's not reasonable to send everyone away to trawl the archives,
read the prerelease changelogs, etc.  That's just shooting
ourselves in the feet.
