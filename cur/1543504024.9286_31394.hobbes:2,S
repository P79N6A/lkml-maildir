Perhaps.  I've watched Corel closely however, and they are taking
part in Open Source projects as well such as Wine.  I'll be the
first to admit that Wine will benefit them, but nonetheless, they
are spending money on developing Wine, and the side effect of
that is that we get WINE working sooner.  They seem very open to
the Linux community IMHO.  I was at their booth at COMDEX as
well, and they were quite friendly, and ready to answer Linux
questions.  Even if they are proprietary, they are friendly
towards the Linux community in a big way, and I think that they
deserve credit for that.  The Wordperfect free download is
certainly another point in favor for them.

Me.  I've got Corel Draw for Linux as well.

Well, I hope that it works well for you if you go with it.  I'm
sure that Andre's work will not fail you, so from that standpoint
you should be ok.  But personally, I still have my own
reservations (although I still want my UPS to breath life
again)...  Talk about stuck between a rock and a lightening
storm...  ;o)
