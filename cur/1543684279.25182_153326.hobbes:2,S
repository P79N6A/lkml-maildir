You could do what we do with our path sandbox - basically you
use a wrapper that setup the environment (prob not needed in
your case), and then spawn bash with our sandbox lib preloaded,
which then calls whatever should be 'path sandboxed'.
Should work with what you do as well, as bash/whatever do not use
c++ code, and when it execute the actual program, your lib should
have hooked into whatever that needs be.
