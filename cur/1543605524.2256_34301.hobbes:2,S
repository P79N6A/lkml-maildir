I may only judge from information you provide, not from information you hide.

1.10 is outdated too, please read

I cannot prevent you from broken Linux installations!
The linux kernel people still have propblems with interfaces and make thanges that
break binary compatibility when going to more recent Linux versions.
Why do you believe that a cdrecord that has been compiled on 2.4 will run on 2.2?
Linux needed close to 10 years to finally support mmap() (ther OS like SunOS
did this since 1987). Cdrecord's outoconf chooses the best interfaces of the OS.
SVS shared mem is outdated and badly implemented on Linux (too many restrictions).
mmap is the modern method to get shared memory but Linux didn't support is before
November 2000.
