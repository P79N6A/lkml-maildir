I'm on a x86 (P4) hi-mem machine, plenty of onboard PCI (audio, LAN, bonus IDE
controller, etc.), and it has sped up my boot process.  Between the USB and PCI
multithread probing, my dmesg is a bit out of order from its ordinary sequence,
but the only things that stall it now are my MD-RAID partitions getting set up.
As far as my mileage, it does speed up performance, but I'm bog-standard and
boring as far as x86 hardware goes.  Obviously, not for everybody.
Thanks!
