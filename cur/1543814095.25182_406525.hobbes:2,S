You've got to have /var checked and mounted to be able to do that log 
write, if the buffer overflows before that, then the head end of the 
dmesg dump to the /var/log/dmesg file is lost forever.
There is a line that can be changed, in xconfig or by hand, to control 
the memory allocated for this ring buffer.
Finally found it in the xconfig display, left panel line=kernel hacking, 
right panel its under kernel debugging and shows only if thats checked, 
double click on the line that says : kernel log buffer size and enter a 
one digit increment from whats there now, maybe 2, I have mine set for 
16.  Your default may be as low as 14, why I have NDI because 16k sure 
as heck isn't enough if something gets chatty.
