You're using the word "community" in a quite abstract way here.
Please document how the linuxtv community behaves behind the
lines, and I would even like that those people who discussed several
things would start to write about their other personal issues with
that project which I'm not part of.

people talk alot, in the end only the result counts. So if you've seen
any binary driver from my side point out to it. To be honest
I think if I would have gone the same way as Avermedia from the
beginning on to release binary drivers it would have saved months
of development and the main distros could already have _full_
support for all the features.
The driver as it is now is not perfect either it requires quite some
more work to get all features work flawlessly around the globe for
all the users.

well people see if they compare the code what you took from the existing

If you look at my current implementation and even the implementation
which I had a year ago many problems are solved there.
I don't mind if you don't want to use the userspace tuner API, it's not
a replacement for the inkernel version, it makes it just easy to
implement it.
The current and upcoming em28xx devices will use it, just to avoid
that I have to redo all the work hundret times for no real reason.

I don't even want to use that existing driver in future (as I wrote earlier
already). The newer module will be a dropin userspace replacement for
what's available. I got around 70 devices work with it at the moment,
although I don't even want to reinvent the wheel so I'll take what I've
received from some companies. That way all I have to do is to use
the provided API of those silicon sample drivers.

That for I wrote the RFCs which didn't get discussed properly and where
2 people of that "community" told me to use something which won't work
out at all.
And hey, why didn't those guys do what they told me to do in the end?
Because they wanted to do it by themself only. Although it's the base
of the driver without a proper base it just screams for more work in the
end.

You don't have to use it if you don't like it, and I get around those
restrictions and I'm able to fix up and extend the features for the
upcoming devices without interfering your work.
