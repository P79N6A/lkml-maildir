The problem did not go away with this patch.
I did some stress test:
I downloaded latest kdeextragear-3 package from CVS and
ran ./configure script many times.
Directly after booting the script runs fine.
But as the uptime increases (I'm now at 15 minutes, when
the script is stuck completely for the first time),
my problem gets worse.
At the very beginning, there was no problem running the script,
but over time problems increased with uptime.
on 5 till 10 minutes of uptime, the configure began to
stuck for 3 or 4 seconds on several (reproducable!) places.#
(you can see these places as nice "holes" in the CPU graph
of gkrellm)
Now (15 min) it's completely stuck and doesn't get a timeslice.
Now another "problem":
Maybe it's because I'm tired, but it seems like
your fix-patch made moving windows in X11 is less smooth.
I wanted to mention it, just in case there's some other
person, who sees this behaviour, too. In case I'm the
only one seeing it, you may forget it. ;)
