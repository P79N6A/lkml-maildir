Yes, it is exactly how block device, not crypto layer, may operate,
but it has very limited usage for block devices in given model,
when it only encrypts storage.
Above setup may be implemeted for the userspace/kernelspace application,
which requires continuous access to the key material from 
the both sides, but asynchronous block device
(and existing cryptoloop and dm-crypt) use diferent model, when
controlling userspace application only one time provides 
required key material(using ioctl) and exits, but key material
remains in kernelspace in device's private area.
