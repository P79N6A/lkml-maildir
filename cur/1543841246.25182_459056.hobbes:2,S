It currently does not provide this, but if you know how your card works,
I'm pretty sure you can get this working without such an interface.
If you wish to add this functionality, to make it easier, that would be
great.

It's not focused on industrial controls at all, that just happens to be
the name of it right now, as that is why it was written.  It is much
more generic than that.
"USD" is a bit too close to "USB" for a name.  Any other ideas?

His posted example should show you how this all works together.
