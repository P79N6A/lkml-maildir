This whole SCO thing is overrated.  I worked on the Unixware code base
at Novell, and it's 
putrid in comparison to Linux.  It's got a lot of good apps, but so does
Linux.  This kind of tripe propaganda is what the "cult" followers of
Unixware are good at.  They lost @ $ 38,000,000 dollars each year at
Novell ramming UnixWare down our throats and pissing of our customers --
Novell finally cut rheir losses and sold it.  Don't get me wrong, it's
decent Unix stuff, but Linux is tons better as a general purpose PC
Unix.  Just remember, Caldera is a LINUX company -- they will take the
best of both, and use it to improve Linux ....
