Although there can be cases where it looks much more like an
optimisation (eg. where the branch and increment occurs much
more often), but it would still be a bug. Granted they are
rather constructed cases, but I don't think you want to rely on
the fact that most of the time it's OK.

Marking volatile I think is out of the question. To start with,
volatile creates really poor code (and most of the time we actually
do want the code in critical sections to be as tight as possible).
But also because I don't think these bugs are just going to be
found easily.

Hard to know how to do it. If you can, then it would be interesting.
