For the specific x86 swab code, that would certainly be the simplest
way, user space should not be using those inline assemblies either
way.
I think the more interesting question is whether we want to export
*any* inline helpers that are not part of the ABI to user space.
We already killed most of them (spinlocks, atomics, ...) and what
remains is basically just the byteorder code. All that is required
for the ABI is the information whether the system is big- or
little-endian, but not all the rest.
