You have to take in to account that by creating a new kernel image
you are storing it sometimes after a long long time at perhaps maybe
another block group far away.  This is becouse ext2 suddenly may feel
like doing so...And surprisingly you have to teach lilo about the new
far away sectors becouse basic C/H/S addressing can't reach them
anylonger. Been there seen that frequently enough.
It would be maybe informative if you could actually provide the
first sector address used by the inode corresponding to vmlinuz.
At least this way one could resolve the issue definitively.

I have told you :-).
BTW.> Please don't consider RH lilo "fairly standard" it *is* messing
with the geometry issues, since in esp. limbo.
