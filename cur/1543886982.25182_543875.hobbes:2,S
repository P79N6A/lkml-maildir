Hi,
if I'm not mistaken, despite the PCI_MULTITHREAD_PROBE removal,
Cornelia Huck wanted to keep driver-core-per-subsystem-multithreaded-probing.patch:

Yes, it would be the same.

However, device_probe_drivers() remains temporarily unused, so we either
suppress the compiler warning or remove the whole function altogether. The
following patch does the first.

This patch shuts the following warning:
drivers/base/dd.c:211: warning: 'device_probe_drivers' defined but not used
