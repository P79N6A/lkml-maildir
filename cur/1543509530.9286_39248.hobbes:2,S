No, we should keep the kernel stable just so this character can get _his_
favorite patch in. That this means that development stands still isn't an
issue, as he sees this as a way to _speed up_ development. Plus splinter
the develoment into a thousand branches, so everybody has his own, and get
Linus to bless some of them. But blessing only some, not all, is probably
not transparent enough, so... And the head hackers also have to do the work
to join all these gratuituous branches, and go hunting for worthwhile
pieces to integrate!
Add the arrogance to talk about "accountability", as if the Linux community
at large owes him something.
I think this is just a very well done troll.
