Not really. Cpufreq can look at all the CPUs in affected_cpus and call
new_target() only for CPUs that are online. Or it can call for every CPU
and the actual implementation in driver can do something like
set_cpus_allowed(requested_processor_mask)
If (get_cpu() != requested_cpu) {
	/* CPU offline and nothing can be done */
	put_cpu();
	return 0;
}
This is what I did for new cpufreq interface I added for getavg().
It was easy to ensure the atomic driver call as only one driver is
using it today :-)

That is the reason I don't have a patch for this now.. :-) There are
more
than 10 or so drivers that need to change for new interface. I haven't
checked
whether it is possible to do this without sleeping in all those drivers.

Yes. I was thinking about it. One possible solution is to move 
create_workqueue()/destroy_workqueue() as in attached patch.
Thanks,

Not fully tested at the moment.
Remove callbacks using workqueue callbacks in governor start and stop.
And move those call back to module init and exit time.
