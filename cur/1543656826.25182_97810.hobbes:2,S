Supposing I wanted to try out the latest aic7xxx driver?
These are they, right?
    
http://people.freebsd.org/~gibbs/linux/SRC/aic79xx-linux-2.4-20021220.bksend.gz
I'm looking at it, and I don't know what it is, bit it sure 
isn't anything I recognize as usable.
    $ file aic79xx-linux-2.4-20021220.bksend 
    aic79xx-linux-2.4-20021220.bksend: ASCII English text
Is the latest aic7xxx driver available as, say, a unified diff,
or a tarball, or some similar usable format?
