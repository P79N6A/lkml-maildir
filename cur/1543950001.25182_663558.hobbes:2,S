Subject: [GIT PATCH] driver core fixes against 2.6.25-rc3 git
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/4/518

Here are a few driver core fixes against your current git tree that fix some
more problems that have cropped up:
	- suspend/resume bugfixes
	- ksets were not getting properly initialized
	- CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED was catching people with old userspace
	  versions of LVM now that the block core is changed to use
	  struct device.
	- other driver core bugs on error paths.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
Patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
greg k-h
