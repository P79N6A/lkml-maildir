Some of the later seems to be related to the lack of CONFIG_PM .. it's
not much a lavish maintainership issue than the fact that nobody every
builds the powermac drivers without CONFIG_PM :-) I'll look into fixing

As for the ps3 bits, it's a known problem, the ps3 support is still very
much a work in progress.
