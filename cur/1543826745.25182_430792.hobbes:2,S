Okay, I see that.
Someone should probably alert the Solaris folks that they might have a 
bug in
their NFS clients.  I suspect that they are only sending over the size 
element
in some of the over the wire SETATTR calls when they really should be 
sending
the size and mtime elements.  This might head off a potential customer issue
where they blaim Linux instead of Solaris.
    Thanx...
