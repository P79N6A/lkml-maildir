You mean like the power management people want?  :)

Ick, no.  Use the power interface for this.  If you aren't already on
the new linux-pm mailing list (hosted by osdl.org) you might want to be,
as people are discussing this there.

But now that module paramaters are able to be passed as command line
arguments, doesn't that solve the issue?  :)
Anyway, I think people are working on making those kind of values
persistant in a way, see the patches on lkml for something like this
(from what I can tell, I haven't really been paying attention though...)

You are forcing the user to do too much work in order for their devices
to start working :)
I understand the issue you are trying to solve, but what about something
like the "persistant device tree" issue that we've all been talking
about over the past few years?  That would let systems where we can not
probe for devices to be created all at once (like on most embedded
systems) and I think would solve your resource issues too, right?
thanks,
