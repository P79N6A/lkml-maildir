Thanks for picking up the sata_mv development, Jeff!
I can confirm your results on a 5041 controller:
sata_mv 0000:02:08.0: version 0.25
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:02:08.0[A] -> GSI 26 (level, low) -> IRQ 177
sata_mv 0000:02:08.0: 32 slots 4 ports SCSI mode IRQ via MSI
ata11: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0x0 ctl 0xF8C22120 bmdma 0x0 irq 177
ata12: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0x0 ctl 0xF8C24120 bmdma 0x0 irq 177
ata13: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0x0 ctl 0xF8C26120 bmdma 0x0 irq 177
ata14: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0x0 ctl 0xF8C28120 bmdma 0x0 irq 177
ATA: abnormal status 0x80 on port 0xF8C2211C
ata11: dev 0 cfg 49:2f00 82:74eb 83:7feb 84:4123 85:74e9 86:3c03 87:4123 88:007f
ata11: dev 0 ATA-7, max UDMA/133, 781422768 sectors: LBA48
(there is a 400GB Hitachi disk attached to the first port)
However, when running 'insmod ./sata_mv.ko' with a disk attched, 
insmod doesn't return, it gets blocked into "D" state (gdb says 
"ptrace: Operation not permitted." while strace attaches but doesn't 
show anything and cannot be detached). This is with the 2.6.15-rc1 
based FC devel kernel (2.6.14-1.1665), using up-to-date FC4 user 
space, if that helps... This is not an one-off, I was able to 
reproduce it three times out of three :-(
Another thing that I noticed and don't know if it's normal is that the 
ataXX ports remain "allocated" even after rmmod; I have two ICH6 ports 
(ata1 and 2) and then insmod-ed the sata_mv driver 2 times without 
disks attached (which took ata3-6 and ata7-10) and then the insmod 
shown above.
Thanks again!
