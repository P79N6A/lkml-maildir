Hi Riley,
WRT 2.2.5-22....I apologize for the silly question, but I'm confused.  I've 
installed 2.2.5-15 on two separate systems both with the aic7xxx driver 
installed.  One's an SMP system(Dell PowerEdge 2300 2x450MHz with aic7890 & 
a couple of AHA-2944UW's, 256MB, 2x 4.3GB)and the other is a UP system (NEC 
ExpressServer 5800 120Ra2 500MHz with 128MB, 8.7GB SCSI drive, ncr53x896 & 
3 AHA-2944UW).  I need to at least attempt to use 2.2.5 of some flavor for 
a test I'm doing.
What pieces of the 2.2.5-22 do I need?  Do I need the smp (for the SMP 
system obviously), source, and kernel-2.2.5-22.i686.rpm or just one of 
those pieces?
Please let me know if you need more information and TIA.
Heather
