It does, see my reply to Maynard.  Not sure what I was thinking
when I wrote this, possibly I was thinking of the inaccuracies.

Actually, I was trying to cover issues such as anonymous
memory.   If the kernel doesn't generate dcookies for
the load segments the information is not recoverable once
the task exits.  This would also allow the loader to create
an artifical elf header that covered both the base executable
and a dynamicly linked one.
Other alternatives exist, such as a structure for context-id
that would have its own identifing magic and an array of elf
header pointers.

Yes, which means it needs to parse the header (or libpse
be enhanced to write the monitor info to a spufs file).

It allows the user space to know when the sample was taken
and  be aware of the ambiguity.   If the sample rate is
high enough in relation to the overlay switch rate, user space
could decide to discard the ambiguous samples.

Actually, It could check all load segments, and only report
those where the dcookie changes (as opposed to the offset).

It definitely is overhead.  Which means it would have to be
optional, like gprof.
