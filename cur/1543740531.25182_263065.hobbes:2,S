Yes. I tried Ole's patch. That helped on one of my laptops. But, on 
the other one it doesn't work. It goes into real mode but never returns.
Both systems had Radeom 9000M cards, but one with older version of the 
firmware (didn't work) and one with newer version.
IIRC, even Stefan had similar problems with Ole's patch.
Thanks,
Venki
