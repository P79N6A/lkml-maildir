 Chandra, Dave's suggestions for the memory controller makes a lot of
 sense.  Can you post the current code, ported to the patch set that
 I just posted, to linux-mm for comment?

 You can access the various current controllers via the ckrm-tech
 archives from sf.net/projects/ckrm today.
 However, if there are additional changes to the core, I'd like to
 see them as patches built on top of this core set.  Resending the
 modified core each time makes it hard for people to see what has
 changed from release to release, where individual patches will help
 track modifications better.
