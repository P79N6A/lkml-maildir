Many bugs have been fixed in netfilter code since 2.4.31, you should
really upgrade, either to 2.4.33-rc2, or to 2.4.31-hf32.6 which contains
adds to 2.4.31 all relevant fixes till two weeks ago. You can find it
here :

If the problem is new, it can indicate a hardware problem, or someone
succeeding in exploiting one of those old bugs.
Regards,
Willy
