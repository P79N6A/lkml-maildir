heh.  I *am* an ass.  That is indeed /proc/bus/pci, not /proc/bus/usb.
  Ewps.  lsusb *does* segv, although the fact that I was in the wrong
  directory is intriguing.  Maybe I'll get the same problem as I got
  with lsusb when trying lspci.  Hmm.
To my knowledge, there is no oops data.  I'll send more data when I get a
  chance to reboot into that kernel.
