Is there any way that this can be triggered remotely? I frequently get
into situations with a particular machine where 'reboot' or 'reboot -f'
just plain won't work, and would like to be able do a 'filesystem clean'
forcible reboot, but don't particularly care about services being shut
down cleanly. Of course, the key is, I'm not at the keyboard of the
server in question.
I figured there may be some way to have a module do this, but if anyone
has any ideas, I'd appreciate it. I did see the example sent not too
long ago about triggering a panic, but that won't cleanly unmount the
filesystems.
