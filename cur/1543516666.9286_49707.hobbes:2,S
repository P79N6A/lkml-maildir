The Fn-D key combination doesn't work on the newer VAIO 505 notebooks,
such as my PCG-N505VE. It only works in Windows. The only user-mode screen
blanking program I'm aware of is the KDE DPMS stuff.

Perhaps it is -- can anyone tell me how the Fn+<key> combinations are
reported to the OS? I tried showkey but it doesn't display anything for
these combinations. (I admit I don't know the Linux keyboard driver
though, so maybe I'm just confused.)
Perhaps a kernel module could trap the special function key combinations
and export the information to a daemon.
I don't care so much about display blanking -- right now I have no LCD
brightness or sound volume control, and the system idle doesn't work
either. Suspend-to-RAM works, but not suspend-to-disk (which is a BIOS
call, unlike most of the other non-functional features).
