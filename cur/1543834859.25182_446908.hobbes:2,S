Essentially I don't think there is much you can do about this on this 
board. The memory space starting at around 3.2GB is being used by the 
memory-mapped IO regions for the PCI and PCI Express devices and 
motherboard resources and therefore "covers up" the RAM in that part of 
the address space. The solution to this is for the system to remap the 
affected memory above the 4GB mark, which is possible with Athlon 
64/Opteron CPUs and on some of the Intel server chipsets. However, I 
don't think any Intel desktop chipsets support this for some 
unfathomable reason.
