I am happy to leave the situation as is since it does not affect SGI. 
We have a memory mapped timer that does not need this jitter compensation.
Other IA64 vendors will see that their timer performance drops 
significantly after the new timer subsystem is in. IBM no longer 
has IA64 systems that rely on ITC?
