WAAIITTT!!!!!!!
You need to get this off the linux.kernel.org
I have the onstream code integrated.
It may be their product, but I am responsible in the kernel.

Grab 2.2.14 and its patch and then raise question.
Next bring it to my attention and Gadi or I will address Onstream about
the issue.

These are DGD (Don't Giva Darn) messages but do need to be cleaned up.
Onstream,
I saw ide-tape.c v1.16e1 but I have v1.16f.
What have you added that neither Gadi or I know about?
