Not this time. I had written that in in the first version of the email
but then scrapped that and rewrote and forgot to put it in.
Basically the complaint was that tmpfs was being registered in cached
memory but it wasn't really cache. Now that I'm a bit more awake I
see that as not being that big a deal.

Yes. :) But I would've hit problems anyway as I completely forgot about 
tmpfs when I was trying to figure out why the oom killer was kicking in
and free was reporting high cache usage which would mean that that
ram is available for more permanent use rather then being used by something
that already has it allocated more or less permanently.

I wouldn't think so. If I haven't used something in my tmpfs mounts
for a while it should be gone to swap as I'd much rather the memory
be used for active caching and other more immediately useful bits.

Well the above isn't a complaint but rathe rmore of a thought. ;) I
do some unimportant logging to tmpfs so that it's there when I need
it but doesn't actually need to survive a reboot. Chucking that to
swap sooner rather then later would be a good thing for me I reckon.
