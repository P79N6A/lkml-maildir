Perhaps the solution is to have shorter development cycles. Say 6
months before feature freeze, then a planned 3 month shakedown
(extended only if there are reliability problems). Part of the problem
is that so many new things get piled into each development series. Cut
back on the number of significant things per cycle (say just one or
two).

Yeah, but things will always be changing, so we have to live with
it. Otherwise we can end up waiting for the perfect kernel before it
gets released. Next we'll be investing in an organ.
