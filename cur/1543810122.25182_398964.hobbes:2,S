Well, I would more like a technical based discussion instead of
flamming. As I said previously, why not have both swsusp and suspend 2
in mainline, as they can coexists without any problem.

Maybe I will, but my current setup does not allow this. When Fedora Core
5 comes out in some weeks I will give it a try. But as said, what I want
is a stable and reliable suspend, not something that works in "most of
the cases". Suspend 2 has proved to me and others that is stable.
(BTW: in the last 200 cycles I did with various Suspend 2 versions I had
exactly 1 (_one_) "failure" (Xorg crashed on resume and I had to restart
my windowmanager). That "failure" was not even Suspend 2 related, but a
small bug in Xorg which got already fixed in the meantime.

You are welcome.

No, I do not think so. I do not know about SuSE (although I think you
are right there), but Fedora does _not_ ship swsusp. It was rejected for
a long time because it was considered too dangerous. Recent rawhide as
enabled it, but I doubt there are as many testers for it as there are
for Suspend 2 (on Fedora). That might change with Core 5 (which is
scheduled to be released in March), but I think we have to wait for
that.

OK, I will give it a try in some weeks.

So why is that? From what I see, most of the code is completly independ
of the rest of the kernel, and just does not affect if it is disabled.
It won't do any harm to the kernel, and again, Nigel is constantly
improving that situation, so for sure, that is no _big_ con.

Why would it hurt? See above, I cannot see how Suspend 2 would affect
the rest of the kernel and hurt people who are just not using it.

These "big changes" is something I have a problem with, since it means
to delay a working suspend/resume in Linux for another "short-term" (so
what does it mean: 1 month? six? twelve?). It is painful to get these
things to work reliable, I have followed this for nearly 1.5 years. And
again: today there is a working implementation, so why not merge it and
have something today, and then start working on the other things.
I would think that this would help both sides, as it would give us a
working implementation now, and in some time (I would like to believe
you, but sill think that it will take at least one year, maybe two,
until you have uswsusp work stable) the new implementation (and then we
can look which one works better, and maybe deprecate the other).
