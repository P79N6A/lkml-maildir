Depends on the customer, and how critical the operation is to the
customer. I'm working on a backup plan for a company now, to satisfy
their "smoking hole" disaster recovery plan. You don't do that unless
your company survival depends on it, but I've helped put backup in other
countries (for a bank in Ireland), etc.

And power failure, loss of ISP connectivity, loss of phone service...
As said originally, reliability is *hard* and *expensive* to do right.

For totally redundant equipment the probability of having some failure
goes up, the probability of total failure (unavailability) goes down.
"You pays your money and you takes your choice."
Actually we were talking about HT, or so it seems looking at the past
items, and if you get a failure of one sibling I have to believe that
other CPUs on the same chip are more likely to fail than those not
sharing the same cooling, power supply, cache memory, and die. I bet
you don't have numbers either, feel free to share if you do.
This would be a good topic for comp.arch, it's getting a bit OT here.
