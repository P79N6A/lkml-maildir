It might not be.  We could come up with some dopey per-process flag,
inherited across fork which means "invalidate each file's pagecache when I
close it".  get/set that flag with a new syscall, or sys_prctl().  That
way, people could do:
	/bin/run-cache-friendly tar cf /dev/tape /huge-filesystem
and not have their pagecache trodden all over.  Extra points for nuking
dentries and inodes too.
It's not particularly pretty, but it would be effective for the most
commonly complained about scenarios.
