Okay. It works on 2.4.21, the code is identical to 2.4.20 which also
works. On 2.4.22, bad CRC errors which terminate the read, don't
always result in a bad return code. Some just return 0, which
is treated like EOF in user-mode code. Application software
has to add a call to fstat() to see if the bytes read were equal
to the file size as a work-around. This step should not be required.
Cheers,
