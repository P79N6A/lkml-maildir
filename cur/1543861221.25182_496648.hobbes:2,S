Much does. But I did some debugging (when trying to figure out the VM 
corruption), and certainly not all of it does. And when I looked at some 
of the code-paths, I was not at all sure that we could always get the 
lock easily.

No, it still happens as frequently as before - because the page must STAY 
dirty while it's writable. So it's still dirty when unmapped.
What the dirty mmap tracking patches do is that if a _lot_ of pages are 
dirty, we'll do the balancing, and at that point, if we end up doing IO, 
we mark them clean in the page tables again. 
But don't think that they aren't dirty in the page tables, and that 
zap-page range doesn't do stuff. I made that thinko myself at some point, 
but it's wrong.

Well, this is what the dirty mmap tracking should finally have fixed. We 
know we have only a _limited_ number of dirty pages, in a way that we 
never knew before.
But afaik, it wasn't just zap_pte_range(), it was something else too that 
didn't have the page lock.  Maybe I remember wrongly, though.
Anyway, the fundamental issue doesn't go away: the page lock isn't 
actually the worst of the dirty bit handling.
