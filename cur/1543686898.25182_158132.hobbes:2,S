Some time ago, I reported problem WRT resource leakage in kernel_thread. 
(2.4.20) To demonstrate it, I submitted program that uses /proc file to 
display some info and to start/stop kernel thread. I don't want to 
re-post this code again.
Finally, I found that resource leak present only if you create 
kernel_thread as non-root. With my previous example, do "insmod" as 
root, while perform actual thread creation/destruction (echo "+" 
 >/proc/kthread etc.) as non-root.
To demonstrate it better, I added to /proc 'read' procedure content of 
"struct user_struct" (current->user).
It makes clear, that in this case current->user->processes do not 
decremented when thread destroyed, and eventually reaches user limit 
(usually 4k processes). At this point, this user can do nothing.
Problem leaves in "reparent_to_init" code in kernel/sched.c; there 
current->user is simply changed to point to INIT_USER without proper 
resource management.
Does it worth inclusion in 2.4.22?
Following patch fixes this bug. I verified that with this patch applied, 
kernel_thread behaves properly.
