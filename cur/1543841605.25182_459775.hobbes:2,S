What are the performance implications?  Do they completely erase any
performance gains that these patches might have given in the first
place?  Has there been any evaluation of these other two alternatives?
As I understand it, carrying out this performance analysis would be very
difficult for most of the kernel community to perform.
Keeping a nice count of the number of writable PTEs sounds like
something that might be generally useful.  Could we split
page->_mapcount to keep track of r/o and r/w ptes separately?  Or,
perhaps a single bit in it can be utilized to replace PG_writable,
instead.
