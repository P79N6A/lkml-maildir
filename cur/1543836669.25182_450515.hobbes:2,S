So, just to be sure - we're fine with atime being lost due to crashes,
errors, etc?
I don't see why not, but I figure it'd be good to make sure there's some
concensus on that.
If that is in fact the case, OCFS2 could do the same thing as XFS and
update disk only when we're going there for some other reason. The only
thing that we would have to add on top of that is a disk write when we're
dropping a cluster lock and the inode is still 'atime-dirty'.
