Are there any such examples known of such drivers? It doesn't seem to 
make much sense.. PCI IO writes are not posted on any known system (the 
spec allows them to be posted in the host bus bridge, but if they were 
they could only be flushed by a read, not a write) and PCI MMIO writes 
are only guaranteed to flush by doing a read from that device, not by 
other random port accesses. I suppose using the _p versions of port 
accesses might happen to mask such problems on certain machines..
