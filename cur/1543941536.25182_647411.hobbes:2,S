Sorry for asking this question here in kernel mailing list but I
thought this would be the best place for my problem. I thought the
problem is related with the kernel and not with my distribution.
I even asked the same question at two user mailing lists but didn't
got any solution from them yet.
May be I need to wait for few more days for any solution. :-(
Thanks,
