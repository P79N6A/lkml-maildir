Yes, I did this as a test and was impressed that the performance was comparable
to what I get in NT.  I expected the Unix domain sockets I was using to cost
a lot more time than they did.  Even so the code complexity was unwelcome.
Look at any GUI.  They all multiplex the keyboard, mouse and window events
so you read just one input source.  To duplicate what I do with WaitForMultipleObjects
in NT I would need 13 threads in just one of my processes.  All of those threads
would probably just grab a process wide lock as soon as they come unblocked
to save me from analyzing all of the potential concurrency.
