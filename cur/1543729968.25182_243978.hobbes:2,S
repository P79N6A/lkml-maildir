Yes:
# blkid
...
/dev/sda4: LABEL="ZIP-100" UUID="34D8-1C07" TYPE="msdos"
/dev/sda1: UUID="1ac5969c-8fdf-4f69-934a-c6103d93c05d" TYPE="ext2" 
/dev/sdb4: LABEL="ZIP-100" UUID="34D8-1C07" TYPE="msdos" 
...
# blkid /dev/sda1
# blkid /dev/sdb4
# blkid
...
/dev/sda4: LABEL="ZIP-100" UUID="34D8-1C07" TYPE="msdos"
/dev/sda1: UUID="1ac5969c-8fdf-4f69-934a-c6103d93c05d" TYPE="ext2"
/dev/sdb4: LABEL="ZIP-100" UUID="34D8-1C07" TYPE="msdos"
...

So, the cache file is not updated.
Moreover, the cache file has never been correct - there is only
one ZIP drive here and it is /dev/sda. The disk inside has only
one nonempty partition, and it is /dev/sda4.
The command # blkid -c /dev/null does not list these two bogus
entries, and a new /etc/blkid.tab is written, but a subsequent
command # blkid again lists the bogus entries.
Doing # rm /etc/blkid.tab* by hand helps.
