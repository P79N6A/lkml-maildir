Did I really say something that bad? I would be actually surprised, if
Victor wouldn't act in the best interest of his company. The other
possibility is that Victor must have had such a terrible experience with
IRIX, so that he thinks any attempts to add better soft realtime or even
hard realtime capabilities (not just as addon) must be doomed to fail.

Preemption doesn't solve of course every problem. It's mainly useful to
get an event as fast as possible from kernel to user space. This can be
the mouse click or the buffer your process is waiting for. Latencies can
quickly sum up here to be sensible.
