Subject: [patch] fix atm/iphase.c .text.exit error

The function ia_remove_one in drivers/atm/iphase.c is __devexit but the
pointer to it doesn't use __devexit_p resulting in a .text.exit error if
!CONFIG_HOTPLUG.
The following patch is needed:
--- linux-2.4.21-pre6-full-nohotplug/drivers/atm/iphase.c.old	2003-03-27 22:45:31.000000000 +0100
+++ linux-2.4.21-pre6-full-nohotplug/drivers/atm/iphase.c	2003-03-27 22:46:28.000000000 +0100

This patch applies against 2.4.21-pre6 and 2.5.66. I've tested the 
compilation with 2.4.21-pre6.
Please apply
