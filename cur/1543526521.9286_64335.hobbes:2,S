I've always thought the floppy disk drive had a bad design flaw. It should
have had the ability to lock the drive (much like CD-ROMs do) to prevent
the user from ejecting when not flushed. It might have saved much grief
for millions of humans over the last 20 years!
Does the LS120 floppy drive locks the drive? 
Cheers, 
Alex
