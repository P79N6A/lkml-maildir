If I understand you correctly, you seem to think that this work
of identifying every piece of code which can end up unused under
specific combination of CONFIGs, and #ifdef'ing it out,
should be done by people, not machines.
I disagree.
Allyesconfig kernel has ~1700 unused functions/data objects,
and it is only *one* of possible .configs.
There is more than 2900 CONFIG options in kernel, giving you
about 3^2000 possible permutations.
If you find it interesting to work on making them
to not have unused functions, more power to you,
and good luck convincing people to accept tons
of additional #ifdefs.
