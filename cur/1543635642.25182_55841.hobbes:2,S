(whilst on the subject of affs, and whilst I remember..)
btw, affs has been failing fsx runs again for the last few kernels.
truncating to largest ever: 0x13e76
domapwrite: mmap: Invalid argument
LOG DUMP (4 total operations):
1(1 mod 256): TRUNCATE UP   from 0x0 to 0x13e76
2(2 mod 256): WRITE 0x17098 thru 0x26857    (0xf7c0 bytes) HOLE
3(3 mod 256): READ  0xc73e thru 0x1b801 (0xf0c4 bytes)
4(4 mod 256): MAPWRITE 0x32e00 thru 0x331fc (0x3fd bytes)
fsx: save_buffer: short write, 0x30ba8 bytes instead of 0x331fd
This is on an affs image mounted over loopback.
Before/After copies of the image available on request..
