Sounds like Jean isn't very excited about this idea..

I have to say no on this one. The device tree is not supposed to know
about how linux uses devices, there are firmwares out there that don't
use DTS for thier device trees, etc.

In my opinion this is an OK solution since the same information has to
be added somewhere already anyway -- eiither to the drivers or to this
translation table. It should of course be an abstacted shared table,
preferrably contained under the i2c source directories since several
platforms and architectures might share them.
