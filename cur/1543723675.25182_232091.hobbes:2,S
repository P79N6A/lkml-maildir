I'm using Debian testing.
I looked at keymap definition. For ScrLock there is this:
keycode 70 = Scroll_Lock Show_Memory Show_Registers
control keycode 70 = Show_State
alt keycode 70 = Scroll_Lock
If I want the same behavior as with english keymap, I should either
use Alt-ScrLock or rewrite the keymap.
Thanks for your time.
