/proc/beep is a kernel tweak that sends beep "signals" to a userspace
process reading the /proc/beep file.  There are one or two of these
modules you can find on the Internet.  In order to support them the
kernel needs to export kd_mksound.
Would a /proc/beep module be accepted into the main tree?  From the
ones I've found, I can understand why they might not be accepted.  But
I'm willing to do the [small amount of] work required to get one looking
like other kernel modules.
If not, could at least kd_mksound be exported by default anyway?  This 
would allow homegrown /proc/beep's to not require any kernel mods.
thx
