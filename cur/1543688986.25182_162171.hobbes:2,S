You're right. You can't no matter what all the "network experts"
around here say. It's either placing a shaper at the ISP or getting a
second line.
I still don't understand why you don't simply co-lo the bkbits.net
box. There should be plenty of housing centers in the Bay Area within
a 30 minute drive of your office. ;-)
