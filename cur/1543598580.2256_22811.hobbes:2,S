Only because if not, this argument is irrelevant, in that if SHA-1
is not broken and can never be, then there is no point in the entropy
measurement and blocking behaviour at all, and in this case, Robert's
patch does no harm whatsoever.

Perhaps I'm missing something, but /dev/urandom is only weaker than
/dev/random NOW if SHA-1 is cracked (if not, the two are identical
in 'strength'). And, in the extremely theoretical case that
SHA-1 is crackable (perhaps with an attack that takes many days),
then wanting to have gathered entropy before reading is useful.
As you point out (above), and as did David, SHA-1 being cracked
is a remote possibility in the extreme. But this scenario is the
only one where Robert's patch could make a conceivable difference.
If SHA-1 is invulnerable, then why argue against Robert's patch
which merely stops some applications from not working on some machines.
But people obviously do have concerns about the reversibility of SHA-1,
even if only at a very theoretical level, or they wouldn't be
spending all this time arguing about the importance of metering entropy.
Adding entropy from the network and not accounting for it is probably
better than nothing (as it makes the seeding problem better).

I propose not using Jiffies on machines other than some i386's, and
not exposing /proc/interrupts 644 which reduces the attack space
hugely.

IF you can observe packets, and IF you turn the config option
on against advice [1] THEN the strength of /dev/random
will be tainted IF and ONLY IF SHA-1 is breakable (in which
case, as you point out, all sorts of other things break anyway).
I consider this an acceptable risk.
[1] against the advice of a config option which should read
'DO NOT SWITCH THIS ON IF YOU BELIEVE THERE IS ANY CHANCE OF
YOUR NETWORK PACKETS BEING OBSERVABLE AND YOU ARE WORRIED
ABOUT THE SECURITY OF SHA-1' (but the same applies btw using k/b
interrupts with wireless keyboards).
