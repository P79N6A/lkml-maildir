MODULE_MAINTAINER() was discussed a while ago but embedding information into 
the binary has the problem you can't ever change deployed systems, meaning 
it lags by design. If a maintainer changes, people would still be using the 
information from their old binaries, meaning a replaced maintainer might get 
contacted for potentially years still (and the new one not).
(you could avoid that by placing not a name/address in the maintainer tag 
but a pointer to somewhere else but at that point this gets to be about 
solving something else).
Keeping it in the source alone is fine. C files could just embed their 
MAINTAINERS entry as a header:
/*
  * P: Maintainer
  * M: Mail patches to
  * L: Mailing list that is relevant to this area
  * W: Web-page with status/info
  * T: SCM tree type and location.  Type is one of: git, hg, quilt.
  * S: Status, one of the following:
  */
And probably adding fields:
  * I: Info/Summary (for index files and the like)
  * A: Author
  * G: License
and such. Yes, while we're at it, we can pick better letters or full word 
tags ;-)
