if one thread set its current->flag with PF_NOFREEZE, then it means
this thread is unfreezable,does this mean, when the system entered
into a suspended state, even though all the other threads have already
gone sleep, this thread still keeps awaken?
One thing I am very confused is, if all the other threads goes to
sleep,can this only one thread(assume only one thread marked itself as
unfreezable.) still works well?
Regards
Jason
