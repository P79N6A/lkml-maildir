just an FYI:
i just built and installed 2.2.0-pre6 on my home PC this afternoon.
while running Netscape Communicator to access some complicated
web applications, similar stuff was spewed into my /var/log/messages
file, and Communicator started spinning for minutes at a time.
excerpt from /var/log/messages:
Jan 10 18:56:34 slamburger kernel: Process: netscape (stack=c17b7f94,
task=c17b6000)
Jan 10 18:56:34 slamburger kernel: [<c0109b23>] [<c01089f5>] 
Jan 10 18:56:34 slamburger kernel: Process: netscape (stack=c17b7eec,
task=c17b6000)
Jan 10 18:56:34 slamburger kernel: [<c010864d>] [<c01ac96c>] [<c0109935>]
[<c010fb53>] [<c0109b23>] [<c0108954>] 
Jan 10 18:56:34 slamburger kernel: Process: netscape (stack=c17b7f84,
task=c17b6000)
Jan 10 18:56:34 slamburger kernel: [<c010bb91>] [<c010897d>]
i've since rebuilt and rebooted the kernel for other reasons, and now
the problem is no longer recurring.  this didn't look like anything
specific (like an Ooops.) so i didn't think anything of it until i
saw chris's note.
