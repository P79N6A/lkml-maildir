Can I do a syscalls from a bash script?
But in any case, I am not going to suggest any
solution against a script-loader - the mmap change
doesn't prevent that too.
Instead I'd like to evaluate a few ideas about an
ld.so problem. One of which is to _enforce_ the "noexec",
just as you asked for. :)
Please have a look at this patch:

The primary goal is to make access() to respect the "noexec".
