I'm in France at the moment, and am therefore not really able to
follow up on this thread for the moment. I'll try to clarify the above
though:
2 reasons why rpciod cannot block:
  1) Doing so will slow down I/O for *all* NFS users.
  2) There's a minefield of possible deadlock situations: waiting on a
     locked page is the main no-no since rpciod itself is the process
     that needs to complete the read I/O and unlock the page.
Cheers,
