What might make the code a lot clearer, easier to audit, and easier to
fix in the future is to declare new types for fs block offsets and group
block offsets.  Something like "ext3_fsblk" and "ext3_grblk".  That way,
we can declare ext3_fsblk as "unsigned long" and "ext3_grblk" as "unsigned
int", and we could optionally change ext3_fsblk to be "unsigned long long"
later to support 64-bit filesystems without having to re-patch all of the
code.
It would be more clear what type of block offset a function is handling
(fs-wide or group-relative).  If we wanted to be able to overload the
block number with an error code we could use ERR_PTR and PTR_ERR like
macros, and just restrict the filesystem to 2^32 - 1024 blocks until we
extend it to 64 bits.
Cheers, Andreas
