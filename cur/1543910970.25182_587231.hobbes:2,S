If you were running 2.6.26-rc3, that's quite possibly because you didn't
have the follow-up patch that fixed my original patch... it wasn't in
2.6.26-rc3
(
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-usb-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg56
523.html).  It fixed a bug with my patch that wasn't necessary with
Broadcom, but was with nVidia (and Intel, I believe).
That could definitely cause mouse lock-ups.  Sorry, that should have
occurred to me yesterday when you mentioned the problem your kids were
seeing, but it didn't for some reason.
