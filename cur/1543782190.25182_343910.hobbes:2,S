I fixed this one with the patch below.

This one needs more care.  We can't drop the lock, because
the destroy actions need to be protected by that lock, but
we can't release the lock after rose_destroy_socket() because
the object may not even exist any longer.
The problem there, at the core, is that the timer doesn't
grab a reference to the socket, which would make the solution
to this bug very straight forward.
Someone should work on that :-)
