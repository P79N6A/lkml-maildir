Hi, all!
    I'm reading O'Reilly's <<Understanding Linux Network Internals>>
while reading some kernel codes, I've got a question.
    Linux provide QoS using Traffic Control, and I think mostly QoS is
not enabled(right?). When QoS is disabled, does Traffic Control works?
The correspoding kernel code:
int dev_queue_xmit(struct sk_buff *skb){
...
if (q->enqueue) {...
	}
...
}
    I think by default(without QoS support), q->enqueue should be true
except for the no queue devices(software devices), is it right? If so,
is the schedule policy of the queue FIFO?
    I'm just not sure about this...
best regards
Leonid
