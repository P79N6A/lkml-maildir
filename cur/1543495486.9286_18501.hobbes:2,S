	Under 2.2.8 with various Yggdrasil changes, the kernel
crashes while uncompressing its initial ~2MB romfs ramdisk.  At
first, I thought this was a side effect of changing the default
ramdisk block size from 1024 bytes to 512 bytes, but rebuilding
the kernel with the pristine 2.2.7 version of drivers/block/rd.c
did not eliminate the problem.
	I am still investigating this, but I thought I should mention
it now, just in case other people are experiencing the same thing.
