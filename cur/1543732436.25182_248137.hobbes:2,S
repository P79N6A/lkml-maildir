I've had linux-2.6.9-rc1-bk8-Q7 lock up on me this morning not long
after starting a glibc compile resulting from: emerge -uo gnome
although it did survive a make World on xorg-cvs.
Could this have been caused by the bug under discussion?
Unfortunatly I don't have much testing time before I go on hollidays,
so for now I went back to linux-2.6.9-rc1-bk6-Q5 which on my machine is
rock solid.
