Hi,
  couple of peoples asked for G400 support for 2.2.x kernels... I thought
that I'll wait until dualhead G400 arrives to me and after I solve
problems with upper 16MB of videoram, but because of I found new toy,
af_ipx.c, I'm releasing what I have just now.
  So everyone interested in G400 matroxfb driver has two choices:
  (1) There is 
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/matroxfb.gz.
      It contains minimum patch (it was for 2.2.10, June 4). It can drive
      only 8MB of G400 and when I wrote that, I did not have real G400
      in hand... But maybe it works (maybe not).
  (2) Or current driver backported to 2.2.11. There is patch at
      
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/2.2.11.matrox.gz.
      This driver has this limitations:
       (i) Only 16MB is supported. I can display from upper 16MB, but
           I can paint into that area only directly - YBOT register is
           probably only 24 bits, as documentation says, and not 25, as I
           thought... So upper 16MB are reserved for future second head.
      (ii) G400 dualhead is not supported, G200+G400 TVOut/LCD are not
           supported too. I do not have such hardware and there is no doc
           (AFAIK).
     (iii) If you have multiple videocards in the box, G400 must be primary
           (driver is not able to initalize G400 from scratch yet). This
           also means that PPC G400 support probably does not work.
  There are following three issues which must be resolved before I send it
to Alan Cox for inclusion in next 2.2.x:
(a) I have one report that 2.3.13 driver does not work on Mystique 220.
    I do have access to Millennium I, Productiva G100, Millennium G200 and 
    (basic) G400. Could someone confirm that driver works on
    Millennium II, Mystique 180 and Mystique 220?
(b) I cannot check, whether new OpenFirmware code works well under 2.2.11 as
    my Motorola does not have OpenFirmware. If someone can check that and 
    report results to me - there are new matroxfb parameters 'vmode' & 'cmode' 
    - if you have OpenFirmware, you should know better than me, what they 
    mean :-)
(c) I did not test, whether matroxfb on G400 survives XFree, as I do not
    have G400 capable XFree yet.
    						Best regards,

P.S.: Except some glitches happened on driver merge into 2.3.13 (patch
posted today on linux-kernel was almost correct; new syntax for
setup is int __init matroxfb_setup(char*) and for init it is
int __init matroxfb_init(void)), due to stupid bug on my side driver defaults
to resolution 0x0 :-( You can add parameter 'video=matrox:vesa:0x101' to
your boot command line or apply following patch (and recompile kernel, of 
course) to get back 2.3.12 behavior.
