I'd like to be able to override a prompt.
The reason is that in general it's nice for the arch-specific Kconfig
file to include various other Kconfig files (using `source'), but
sometimes an option that usually makes sense as user-definable -- and
thus has a prompt -- _doesn't_ make sense on that particular
architecture.
Currently it seems as if the arch-specific Kconfig can do several things
in this case:
  (1) Inline the more general Kconfig into the arch-specific Kconfig
      (with the offending option removed, and omit the `source').  This
      is undesirable for all the usual reasons (code duplication causes
      bit-rot etc).
  (2) Document somewhere that users shouldn't ever set option FOO, even
      though it asks the question.  This is confusing for users.
  (3) Add a dependency on ARCH_BLAH or something to the definition of
      FOO.  This is probably the cleanest solution, but tends to result in
      arch-specific knowledge being littered all over the place (though
      this is already a general problem with the config system).
It would nice if I could just say in my arch-specific Kconfig:
   option FOO
           bool
           set n
which would force FOO to `n' regardless of any later declarations.
