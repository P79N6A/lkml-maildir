	So, as you've seen, when the kernel needs memory, it can easily throw its
cached data away and gain as much free memory as it needs.

	All true, all good. No matter how much RAM you have available, odds are you
are moving more dat to and from disk then you have RAM. So it sometimes
makes sense to swap stuff to make room for more cache.

	More typically, it contains copies of data that was written to or read from
disk in case it is requested (again).

	If you don't want the computer to use the RAM, take the RAM out of the
computer. The computer will use all of the RAM you give it. Why shouldn't
it?
