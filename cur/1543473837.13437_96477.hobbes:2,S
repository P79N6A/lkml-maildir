When I try to use "smbmount //machine/public /mnt/net/ -c venus", it just
returns 
mount error: Invalid argument
Please look at smbmount's manual page for possible reasons
	the smbmount's manual page suggests recompiling with the new
kernel installed, but this didn't help (I grabbed the rawhide SRPM from
ftp.rge.com and did a --rebuild). smbmount works fine for me under
kernel 2.0.36.
Anyone else having problems with smbfs and kernel 2.2?
