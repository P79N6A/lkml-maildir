Because we have another allocation of very small size for every slot here.
struct dummy_slot has a size of 4 pointers, that's 16 byte for 32 bit 
architectures. Putting 8 byte of additional storage here would save a 
complete allocation on 32 bit platforms. For 64 bit platforms the memory 
usage is the same but we do less allocations (i.e. less points to fail) and 
less memory fragmentation.
Btw: your code lacks a check if kmalloc() returns NULL.
