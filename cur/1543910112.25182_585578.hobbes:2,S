Because they should be thinking about them in terms of barriers, over
which the compiler / CPU is not to reorder accesses or cache memory
operations, rather than "special" "volatile" accesses. Linux's whole
memory ordering and locking model is completely geared around the
former.

That's not the point, because as I also mentioned, the logical extention
to Linux's barrier API to handle this is the order(x) macro. Again, not
special volatile accessors.
