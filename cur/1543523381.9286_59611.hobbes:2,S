I explain myself..
I'm trying to promote myself to a kernel developer.. OK just for my
pleasure,.
I read a lot of books, a lot of docs.. a lot of ALL.. I have a
good foundation in C programing and in UNIX environment, also a good
knowlege in the basis of OS's..
Now I'm doing the first REAL work.. to read the kernel code... the REAL
BOOK.
Of course theres a lot of things I understand at the first glance, but _of
course again_ still there are a lot for I need help..
I understand this is not a list to learn how the kernel code works but a
list to develop kernel code.. so please. Wouldn't be a goog idea to create
a list for this propouse?
It could be linux-kernel-learning of something like that... 
Please I need a list like that and like me I suppose a lot of people too.
Give your opinion please.
Thank you very much indeed..
Saludos!
