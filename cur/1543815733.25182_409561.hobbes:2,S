No, it's actually significant.  The ability to compose initramfs 
contents from multiple sources is one of the major improvements over initrd.
For example, people has asked that kinit should be able to be called 
from user-provided (initrd-loaded) initramfs code.  The easiest way to 
do that is to have the in-kernel module have:
	/init -> /kinit
	/kinit
... and allow /init to be overwritten.
