Ok, the VIA stuff is happy, and enables the irq routing. The fact that the
irq's don't actually seem to ever actually appear means that the enable
sequence is probably slightly buggy.
Can you do two things?
 - enable DEBUG in arch/i386/kernel/pci-i386.h. This should make the code
   print out what the pirq table entries are etc.
 - add the line "eisa_set_level_irq(irq);" to pirq_via_set() just before
   the "return 1;"
Jeff, you had complete VIA docs, right? Can you check that whatever 
Tobias' ends up having output from the debug stuff looks sane?
