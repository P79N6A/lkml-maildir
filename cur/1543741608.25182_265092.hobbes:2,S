This is only a partial solution - __sysrq_trylock_table() is exported to
modules which do who know what with it and they don't know how to handle
locking failures - they'll just go ahead and do a spin_unlock() of an
unlocked lock and mayhem will ensue.
What we need to do is to move all those inlined functions out of sysrq.h,
into sysrq.c then withdraw all those exported-to-modules helper functions
then remove __sysrq_trylock_table() altogether and then use
spin_lock_irqsave() in the appropriate places.
