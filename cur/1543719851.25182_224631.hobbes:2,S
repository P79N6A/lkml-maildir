Okay, vmstat show me the cs according to current load, what is the Maximum
tick rate? 
A process requests a 1 microseconds sleep, or even 500 nanoseconds, how long
does it actually sleep, that is why I need to know max tick rate for context
switch for a given CPU.

The context switch tick rate depends on many things:
- any time an interrupt is triggered, there is a ctx switch,
- schedule() performs a context switch if it finds a suitable process,
- schedule() is called on every blocking io that a process calls for,
so the rate is quite changing ;)
if you want to know the current ctx switch rate, use vmstat
vmstat 1 will gives a line per second on system info:
process statistics, io stats, memory stats, and cpu stats
the one you want is denoted "cs"
