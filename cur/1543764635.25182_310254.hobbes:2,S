Ok, this was literally screaming for a rebuttal! :-)

(Note that here you take a stab at the Arch design fundamentals, but                                 
actually fail to substantiate it later)

[ UI issues snipped, not really core design ]                                                        
Yes, some people perceive that there _are_ UI issues in Arch.                                        
However, as strange as it may sound, some don`t feel so.

This is called modularity and code reuse.                                                            
And given that patch and diff are installed by default on all of the                                 
relevant developer machines i fail to see as to why it is by any                                     
measure a derogatory.                                                                                
(and the rest you speak about is tar and gzip)

Sure, you should`ve had come up with something more based than that! :-)                             
Now to the real design issues...                                                                     
Globally unique, meaningful, symbolic revision names -- the core of the                              
Arch namespace.                                                                                      
"Stone simple" on-disk format to store things -- a hierarchy                                         
of directories with textual files and tarballs.                                                      
No smart server -- any sftp, ftp, webdav (or just http for read-only access)                         
server is exactly up to the task.                                                                    
O(0) branching -- a branch is simply a tag, a continuation from some                                 
point of development. A network-capable-symlink if you would like.                                   
It is actually made possible due to the global Arch namespace.                                       
Revision ancestry graph, of course. Enables smart merging.                                           
Now, to the features:                                                                                
Archives/revisions are trivially crypto-signed -- thanks to the "stone-simple"                       
on-disk format.                                                                                      
                                                                                                     
Trivial push/pull mirroring -- a mirror is exactly a read-only archive,                              
and can be turned into a full-blown archive by removal of a single                                   
file.                                                                                                
                                                                                                     
Revision libraries as client-side operation speedup mechanism with partially                         
automated updates.                                                                                   
                                                                                                     
Cached revisions as server-side speedup.                                                             
Possibility for hardlinked checkouts for local archives. This requires that                          
your text editor is smart and deletes the original file when it writes                               
changes.                                                                                             
Various pre/post/whatever-commit hooks.
That much for starters... :-)
