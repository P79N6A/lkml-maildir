Again...  Just like I said to you in private email...
Show us that you're able to write a 1 for 1 functional correspondance
between CML1 and CML2 and propose that for inclusion into 2.5.  This will
already have the advantage of using a common engine to parse the config
language regardless of the frontend used, along with the readability and
compactness of CML2.  This should not cause a too big cultural change.
Wait for a month or two while developers get used to it.  Then and only then
could you start discussion about advanced CML2 possibilities and features.  
REmember that Linux development only works like a car that you propose
individual parts individually and let people comment on them.  Providing the
whole car already assembled with a "turn key"  package simply doesn't work
with most car hackers.
As a bonus to further stimulate acceptance of CML2, make it work with the
tools that most people already have i.e. Python 1.5.
