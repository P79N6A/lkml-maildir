I agree with Alan. The old NFS code is broken, and the new code doesn't
(as far as anyone knows?) break anything that now works. It's a bug fix. 
It should get into 2.2, but it's now too late IMO for 2.2.13.

How about 2.2.14pre1 or in the ac series for a while and then
2.2.15pre1 or 2.2.16pre1?  Is it even in 2.3 yet?
