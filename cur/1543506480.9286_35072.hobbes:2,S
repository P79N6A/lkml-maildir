I've got very similar problems with my setup here and this with two 
devices! Sometimes Linux get this errors on a IBM DHEA (6.4GB) 
and sometimes it takes the Maxtor 10,8GB. At first I took a guess 
that these devices are too hot and I installed another fan into my 
case. This made it a bit better, but after some time, the old stuff 
appeared :-(
In my case, any appearance of these messages caused a hangup 
of Linux - even SysRq did not work :-( Did you check whether your 
drives are running hot?
