Your approach is "make an incompatible change and see what breaks, then
scramble to fix it".  My approach is "get ready for this change so we
can have a clean cutover".  Also EXPORT_NO_SYMBOLS is the only way to
clean up 2.4 and 2.2 kernels, there is no option to make an
incompatible change to modutils there.
