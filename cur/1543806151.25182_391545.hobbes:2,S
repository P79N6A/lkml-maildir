thanks again. BTW, out of curiosity why do you work on this?

By "live lock" I mean the situation when you are "locked" in 
shrink_dcache_parent() due to wait_on_prunes() always returns 1.
We used shrinker list with a reference to dentry specially to avoid this 
as much as possible. I'm not sure how real such live lock can be 
created, but I can think it over.
>>BTW, what kernel is it for? 2.6.15 or 2.6.16-X?
