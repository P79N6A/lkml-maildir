Though the rescheduling can happen any time.  I'm not sure how is tcache
going to track rescheduling deterministically.  In theory there are
always going to be those pathological cases which will be very difficult
to get right (with or without tcache).

I think I probably read your patch wrong or an earlier version where
user was sending the tcache down to vsyscall.  Is user sending the
tcache parameter containing the last jiffies down to vsyscall in your
latest patch?  Could you please point me to latest patch.
I think the system call is going to come with caveat that the
information provided by vgetcpu could be stale as the process could have
moved to different CPU before returning information.

I agree and that is why I don't think we should export anything relating
to jiffies to external world (may be my smiley selection wasn't right).
This goes back to my understanding that tcache is user visible.
