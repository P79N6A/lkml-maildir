I assume you didn't change anything of the (previously
working) setup?

Are both boxes located in the same room?
Maybe they're getting too hot now for some reason (ambient air
temperature too high, cooler and/or fan not working right)?
Also check your mains power supply. If it's unstable (e.g. voltage
too low), it could cause such effects, too (but this is usually
less likely than overheating).
