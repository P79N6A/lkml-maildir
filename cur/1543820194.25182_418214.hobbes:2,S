welcome to X have a nice day :-)
X is horribly horribly broken in this area, if you remove the 
pci_enable_device from drivers/char/drm/drm_stub.c
and restart everything does it still happen?
The problem is that X uses the fact that the pci bars are disabled to 
decide whether to POST the card using the BIOS, however the card isn't 
actually posted but pci_enable_device enables the BARs...
however not doing pci_enable_device causes interrupts to not work on the 
cards in a lot of circumstances..
Dave.
