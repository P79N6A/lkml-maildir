If you actually want a "devlist.h" file, 2.6.11 has a program 
gen-devlist.c that generates it (and "classlist.h") from pci.ids. The 
kernel source hasn't come with a devlist.h file since before the dawn of 
time (i.e., the beginning of the git repository). The only recent change 
is not including a pci.ids or generating a devlist.h from it.
