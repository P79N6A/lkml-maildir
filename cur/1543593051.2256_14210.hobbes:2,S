Looks interesting. Seemingly literate use of spinlocks.
Off-hand I see old style initialization. Is it right for new driver?
i2c framework is not used, I wonder why. Someone thought that
it was too heavy perhaps? If so, I disagree.
Also, I am curious
if any alignment with lm-sensors is possible, for the sake of
common userland tools? If we managed that, PSARC would eat their
hearts out - they tried to do it since E-250 shipped.
lcd_read bounces reads with -EINVAL when another read is in
progress. Gross.
Nitpicking:
1.:
	p = head;
	while (p) {
		p = p->next;
	}
It is what for(;;) does.
2. Spaces and tabs are mixed in funny ways, makes to cute effects
when quoting diffs.
