Hi...  This patch is flawed.  If we use it, it'll reintroduce the crappy
interactive response when interactive jobs compete with non-niced
CPU-hogs.  This is the one I fixed recently by making
PROC_CHANGE_PENALTY smaller than DEF_PRIORITY (changed from 20 to 15 in
other words).  (And yes, I think it was only relevant to i386.)
If you want to use this type of approach (and it does seem sensible,
though I haven't given it a huge amount of thought), try something like:
    weight += MIN(PROC_CHANGE_PENALTY,p->priority);
(assuming we have a MIN macro - but you get the picture).
cheers
