Me too, and I wonder if we should've dropped a bunch of CCs...

Well, as far as I know adding the following to your xorg.conf should be enough:
Section "Extensions"
        Option  "Composite"     "enable"
EndSection
and then to enable it at runtime start a composite manager.
Reading the mga manpage it seems you need to add
Option "AccelMethod" "EXA"
to the driver section. (Though it says EXA is possibly unstable.)
Run "xdpyinfo | grep Composite" to see if it works or not.
But as you said, getting off-topic, so if the above doesn't work sent a
private mail, or go to the xorg mailinglist.
Greetings,
Indan
