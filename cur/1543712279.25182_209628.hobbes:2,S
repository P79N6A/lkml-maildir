A host driver "USB PTP Storage" would be really nice too.  First
as a generic camera interface, second to access a gadget with the
PTP interface.
(Please embarrass me by saying there already is one, I'll be so happy
I won't care :-) ).
I have a PTP camera and would certainly be happy to test such a driver.
Time to write it is a different matter.
