the thing is, we are not 'making these available to non-GPL modules'. 
The _GPL postfix does not turn the other normal exports from grey into 
white. The _GPL postfix turns exports into almost-black for non-GPL 
modules. The rest is still grey.
in this case, i'd only make local_irq_*() available to modules (of any 
type), not the other paravirt ops. Exporting the whole of paravirt_ops 
was a mistake, and this has to be fixed before 2.6.20. I'll cook up a 
patch.

yep - i've changed this in my tree.
