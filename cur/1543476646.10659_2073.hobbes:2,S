I read the digest version and I am getting hurt by digest latency.
People send in an xconfig bug report or a patch and I don't even see it
for two days.
Here is an idea: change the subscription mechanism so that all new
subscribers get subscribed automatically to linux-kernel-digest rather
than linux-kernel.  Limit un-digestified access to people who really
need it (yeah I know that means a human gets involved somehow).  That
would reduce everybody's latency, digest and non-digest.
