I believe what you are asking here is why can't the
cell_spu_pc_collection() function put the data in to the samples array
for a given node, in the loop that then processes the samples array for
that node.  Yes, I believe that this can be done.  The only restriction
is that cell_spu_pc_collection() will have to extract the SPU program
counter data for all SPUs on that node.  This is due to the fact the
data for the 8 SPUs are all stored in a single entry of the hardware
trace buffer.  Once the hardware trace buffer is read, the hardware
advances the read pointer so there is no way to go back and re-read the
entry.

An LFSR sequence is similar to a pseudo random number sequence. For a 24
bit LFSR sequence each number between 0 and 2^24 will occur once in the
sequence but not in a normal counting order.  The hardware uses the LFSR
sequence to count to since it is much simpler to implement in hardware
then a normal counter.  Unfortunately, the only way we know how to
figure out what the LFSR value that corresponds to the number in the
sequence that is N before the last value (0xFFFFFF) is to calculate the
previous value N times.  It is like trying to ask what is the pseudo
random number that is N before this pseudo random number?
I will add a short comment to the code that will summarize the above
paragraph.
