Subject: [PATCH 2.4] asus vt8235 router buggy bios workaround
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Marcelo,
  Here is backport to 2.4 for fix to
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5235.
Similar problem has been reported before here:
http://groups.google.com/group/linux.kernel/browse_thread/thread/def4ca1
9dbc3cd4/5cffbf349f2c87a4?tvc=2&q=Aleksey+Gorelov&hl=en#5cffbf349f2c87a4
and was related to bug in BIOS reporting 82C686 router compatible to
586.
I suspect BIOS on this board has similar issue: reports VT8235 router to
be
compatible with 586 one - which is obviously not true.  Patch from the
link
above has already incorporated in both 2.6 & 2.4 series, but might not
work
in this particular case.
