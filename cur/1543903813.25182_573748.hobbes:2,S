Hey Andi,
	I've not been able to review the new vdso code very carefully yet, but
I noticed one thing right off: the offset calculation is not masked, so
its possible w/ counters less then 64bits wide to have wrapping issues.
It seems something like the following would be needed.
diff --git a/arch/x86_64/vdso/vclock_gettime.c b/arch/x86_64/vdso/vclock_gettime.c
index 17f6a00..9570f8e 100644
--- a/arch/x86_64/vdso/vclock_gettime.c
+++ b/arch/x86_64/vdso/vclock_gettime.c
@@ -36,8 +36,8 @@ static inline long vgetns(void)

 	cycles_t (*vread)(void);
 	vread = gtod->clock.vread;

 }

Or am I just missing something? 
thanks
