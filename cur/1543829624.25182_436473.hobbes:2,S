Greetings...........
This letter may seem strange I can provide 
irrefutable proof about all I have written. Read this with an open 
mind, verify what I have written independently if you wish and get 
back 
to me.
I am Mr. Brian Benjamin the manager of Auditing and 
Accounting 
department of Fidelity bank of Africa. In my department, we 
discovered 
an abandoned sum of US$60 Million dollars (sixty million 
dollars in an 
account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Mr.
Andrean 
schranner of Munich, Germany) who died along with his entire 
family and 
son in-law and family in July 2000 in a plane crash. For 
more 
information about the crash visit this site

I need someone with a foreign account 
to be able to receive this money, even an empty account can serve to 
claim this money. Should you be willing to complete this transaction, 
send to me your private telephone for easy and effective communication 
and location.
Upon receipt of your reply, I will give you more details 
on this transaction
Yours Faithfully
Mr. Brian Benjamin
