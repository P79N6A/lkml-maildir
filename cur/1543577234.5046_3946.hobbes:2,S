Just add these options to the fb_find_mode() parser in modedb.c, and they'll
work on all fbdev drivers that use modedb. There's no reason to duplicate that
code in each fbdev.
Since matroxfb has the richest set of features (even more than atyfb ;-),
you're actually in the right position to do this :-)
