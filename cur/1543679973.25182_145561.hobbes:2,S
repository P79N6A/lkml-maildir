Updated device-mapper tools (dmsetup + libdevmapper) are now 
available for testing at:
  
ftp://ftp.sistina.com/pub/LVM2/device-mapper/device-mapper-testing-new-version4-interface.tgz
This tarball also includes the complete device-mapper patches 
for 2.4.20 and 2.4.21, also available outside the tarball at:
  
ftp://ftp.sistina.com/pub/LVM2/device-mapper/patches/combined
*
Updated LVM2 tools to work alongside the above are at:
  
ftp://ftp.sistina.com/pub/LVM2/tools/LVM2.0-testing.tgz
If the new tools detect the old version 1 driver, they try to
fall back and use the version 1 API, so you shouldn't
need to keep two sets of tools around if you're regularly
swapping kernels.  [But this hasn't been thoroughly tested.]
