It's a neat trick. It just replaces some 'C' runtime library functions
with do-nothing functions that return success for the user. It could
even replace file I/O stuff so the user changes directory, but what
`ls` shows, never changes (or is blank). A nice preload object library
could be created that could make a good April-fool joke. You've got
about 1/2 year to work on it! Install it in /lib, and when you want
to cause havoc, modify the target's ~/.bashrc file.
Cheers,

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
