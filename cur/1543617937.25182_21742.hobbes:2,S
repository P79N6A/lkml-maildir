I think I know what Andre is referring to (Andre please correct me if I am 
wrong) and if I am correct than you are still safe to use the currently 
existing big patch (as long as you do NOT tamper with it in any way - I 
mean that, a one line change is sufficient to destroy your data). If you 
split it up, there is a _very_ high chance broken code will be executed 
which will destroy your data on first time a PIO transfer occurs...
Best regards,
Anton
