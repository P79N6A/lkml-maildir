It's not slower for me. For me, lmbench shows open/close as being pretty 
stable at least since 2.6.12.
Are you sure that your dentry cache tests haven't just filled up the 
dentry lists so much that when you compare open/close performance after 
the dentry tests, they seem much slower than your numbers from before?
If you run something that fills up the dentry cache, open/close will be 
slower just because the open part will have to traverse longer hash 
chains.
