Asking a question is not bad, but if we can avoid making a situation
that will generate questions I would say that's a worthwhile goal.
x.y.z - if y is odd it's development, if y is even it's stable.
Easy.
z+1 is always newer than z and hence z+1 should contain a bugfix that
z might not. Also pretty simple. x.y.z+1 pre/rc q does not contain
something that x.y.z pre/rc r has is NOT easy. We both know that
me and you will have no problem whatsoever with this scheme. So it's
not about me and you. I just think it will confuse some people that's
all.
