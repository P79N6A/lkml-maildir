There is no such thing as "volatile-qualified access" defined
anywhere; there only is the concept of a "volatile-qualified
*object*".

There is a quite convincing argument that such an access _is_ an
access to a volatile object; see GCC PR21568 comment #9.  This
probably isn't the last word on the matter though...
