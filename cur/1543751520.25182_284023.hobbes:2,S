GENHD_FL_REMOVABLE is set by a number of drivers (floppy, CDROM, ...).
It is used in two places:
(1) to fill the file /sys/block/*/removable
(2) in genhd to suppress listing a nonpartitioned removable device
in /proc/partitions.
In other words, it is for user space only, precisely as Pierre Ossman said.
