Hi Gabor
I just tried compiling a 2.2.10 UP kernel to look at the code, however
I do not get valid code at merge_segments+25 - what compiler did you
use to compile the kernel?
Do you have the vmlinux (not vmlinuz file) somewhere?
I seem to remember that I have seen someone else reports crashes in
merge_segments() a little while ago but I cannot find any trace of it
in the l-k archives ;-(
