That is no measure of stability.
If, say, I merge a large patch in order to support ARM SMP and Linus
takes that, let's say for the sake of argument that's a 10MB diff.
It doesn't touch anything other than files which are solely built or
used for the ARM architecture.
Are you going to claim that the kernel is, therefore, unstable on
x86?
So, by your very comment above, if all the updates to non-x86
architectures were prevented from happening in mainline, you'd have
a much more stable kernel.
Uh huh.  There's a saying about comparing apples and oranges which
springs to mind here - did you miss that lesson?

read replies from the mailing list, thanks.)
