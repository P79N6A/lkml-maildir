Oops!  That patch is wrong.  The +1 should be applied to the initial 
interval _only_.  We KNOW when the repeating intervals start (i.e. at 
the jiffie edge) and don't need to adjust them.  The patch, however, 
incorrectly, rolls them all into one.  The attach patch should fix the 
problem.  Warnning, it compiles and boots, but I have not tested it.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/high-res-timers/
Source: MontaVista Software, Inc. <george@mvista.com>
Type: Defect Fix
Disposition: 
Description:
This changes setitimer as follows:
1. The repeating timer is figured using the requested time 
	(not +1 as we know where we are in the jiffie).
2. The tests for interval too large are left to the time_val to jiffie code.
