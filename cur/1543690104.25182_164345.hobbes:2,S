Subject: [PATCH][2.4.23-pre3] fix networking hangs at suspend/resume

Since upgrading my laptop from 2.4.23-pre2 to -pre3 it started
hanging hard in conjunction with APM suspend or resume. Typically
the hang occurs after 2-3 suspend/resume cycles.
After two days of working through the 2.4.23-pre2 -> 2.4.23-pre3
patch piece by piece, I traced it to this change:
 > Jeff Garzik:
 >   o [NET] move netif_* helpers from tg3 driver to linux/netdevice.h
A while-test_bit in net/core/dev.c was replaced (indirectly via a
new inline function) by a while-test_and_set_bit. This is not correct
in general, and in this code triggers semi-random hangs at suspend
or resume. I've not seen any hangs at other times, however.
This patch reverts the broken part of the cleanup.
