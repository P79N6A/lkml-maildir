Hi,
I just came across a motherboard from SuperMicro (Super P6DGH, at
http://www.supermicro.com/PRODUCT/MotherBoards/440GX/P6DGH.htm
), and was
wondering how operational such a beast would be under Linux. It's a dual
Xeon board, AGP, I2O.
Here's the main feature rundown, and my current level of knowledge about
it:
- "I2O" (on-board i960, with it's own bank of 64M): does the work that
  Alan Cox is doing in the -ac series cover this? Is it functional? Will
  the system even function without that kind of support?
- 9 PCI slots (5 primary, 4 secondary): Will Linux cope with this (I
  don't see why not, but can't hurt to ask)?
- AIC-7896: no problems except for Murphy's Law, far as I know.
- ARO 1130-CA2 RAIDPort III: I know that the adaptec SCSI driver won't
  deal with this at all; are there any projects in the pipe to support
  this controller?
- IR port: I found the drivers/net/irda stuff, and the IrDA project at
  
http://www.cs.uit.no/linux-irda/
 . Looks basically usable...anyone have
  comments? (I don't have any more technical information on the specifics
  of the IR hardware, unfortunately.)
- USB: found 
http://peloncho.fis.ucm.es/~inaky/uusbd-www
 , looks like it
  basically works, but all references seem to be to PPC...anyone using
  this on x86?
- Voltage monitors for CPU, fan status monitors, temperature control,
  overheat alarm, chassis intrusion detection: how accessable would this
  stuff be (I'm especially liking the chassis intrusion detection ;-)?
  I'm assuming most of this, if supported, would appear via /proc?
Just trying to get a feel for how usable this board would be right now,
for someone not afraid to burn themselves a bit with alpha-release
patches. So far, my impression is that it's a tres cool board. ;-)
(I'll happily take pointers to similar-calibre x86 boards too.)
