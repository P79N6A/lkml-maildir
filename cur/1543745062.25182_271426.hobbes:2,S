Changed. FWIW it's been running happily for hours without a single oom, 
including the normally guaranteed build UML test. I'll leave it running 
and see how it goes. The daily cron run is a usually a popular time for 
killing off a few essential daemons (ntpd, sshd &c), in fact I think the 
OOM Killer actually looks forward to it :)
