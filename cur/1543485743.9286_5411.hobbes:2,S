Yes, I've been getting them for far too long too.

That is basically what I meant.  Unsubscribe necon.se users.

Windows Nice Try?  Yeah... Sorry... I *assume* UNIX when someone
refers to a server that is on the net, as anything else, by
definition - is a workstation.  NT server is just a glorified
workstation, and even that is giving it too much credit.
Now that it is clear that it is an NT box, it is also clear the
intelligence level of the sysadmin, and the quality of the
software running on the box, not to mention the business that
owns the computer, their families, and bloodlines...
Anyone know what necon.se is?  I think that maybe they need a
taste of the "slashdot effect".  I'm sure I can find something on
their servers of interest to /. users... lets givem a taste of
"Goodbye server that was on slashdot blues"...

Can someone send me a procmail rule for autoreplying to specific
posts based on subject/poster/domain/etc?  I believe Richard
Gooch has such a wonderful script (that many disagree with, but
which does have its merits.)
