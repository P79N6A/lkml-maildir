That's fine.

I still don't understand why you want to add these sentances.  Why are
they needed?  Are people thinking that the kernel developers just
randomly change things just because they are bored and have nothing else
to do at the moment?  Do people think that our changes are gratuitous?
Even so, I don't think this needs to be added, we have already stated
many good reasons why changing apis are necessary and good.  Do need to
add another one?
