There are almost certainly better people to answer locking questions, but here 
is my take on it ... If you are accessing data both in a bottom half and 
elsewhere you need to make sure you disable bottom halfs from running before 
you access the data outside the bottom half (spin_lock_bh()).  If you are 
accessing data both in an interrupt handler and elsewhere you need to make 
sure you disable interrupts when accessing data outside the irq handler 
(spin_lock_irqsave()).

From my experience the community disapproves of approaches which go through 
the entire TCP handshake and then terminate the connection, which is what 
allowing security_socket_post_accept() to fail would do.
