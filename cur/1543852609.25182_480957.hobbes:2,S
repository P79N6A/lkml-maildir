I don't know exactly where the problem lies, but I have narrowed it down.
In drivers/scsi/sd.c:sd_probe(), the call to add_disk() increases the 
device's refcount by 1.  However in sd_remove(), the call to del_gendisk() 
decreases the device's refcount by 2.  Consequently the structure is 
deallocated too early, causing the oops.
Somebody who knows more than I do about add_disk() and del_gendisk() will 
have to figure what's going wrong.
