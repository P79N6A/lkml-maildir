Hi,
I'm running an openswan gateway for quite a long time now.
I have used 2.4.X and 2.6.X kernels without any problem until i decided 
to upgrade to 2.6.16 kernel.
Summary of problem:
Under 2.6.15 everything is fine
Under 2.6.16 my tunnels establish well, but i can't even ping a single 
computer located on the other end of the tunnel when the firewall is up.
Disabling the firewall solves the problem (but is not an option for me).
$ cat ip_conntrack | grep 192.168.10
icmp     1 8 src=192.168.0.192 dst=192.168.10.1 type=8 code=0 id=793 
packets=4 bytes=116 [UNREPLIED] src=192.168.10.1 dst=XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX 
type=0 code=0 id=793 packets=0 bytes=0 mark=0 use=1
192.168.0.0/24 is my lan subnet (natted so that lan computers can access 
the internet through the public ip address)
192.168.0.192 is a workstation on my lan
192.168.10.0/24 is the other subnet
XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX is my public ip address
If i disable the nat of 192.168.0.0/24, i can ping the other end.
Re-enabling the nat however disables the ability to ping the other end.
Seems iptables is trying to nat packets the wrong way :$, or that I 
missed a major change in 2.6.16.
Do anyone have any clue about this weiredness?
Thanks
Laurent
