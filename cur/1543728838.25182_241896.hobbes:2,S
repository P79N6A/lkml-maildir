The transition from 2.6.8-rc3-mm1 to 2.6.8-rc4-mm1 changes both the
point outlined above and the 8139too driver.
You may:
1 - try the "pci=routeirq" argument at startup on your 2.6.8-rc4-mm1 if you
    have not done so;
2 - apply to your 2.6.8-rc4-mm1 tree:
    
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/linux/kernel/2.6.x/2.6.8-rc4-mm1/8139too-mm-revert.patch
3 - apply to your 2.6.8-rc4-mm1 tree:
    
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/linux/kernel/2.6.x/2.6.8-rc4-mm1/8139too-mm-revert.patch
    
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/linux/kernel/2.6.x/2.6.8-rc4-mm1/8139too-10.patch
    
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/linux/kernel/2.6.x/2.6.8-rc4-mm1/8139too-20.patch
Feedback on points 1, 2 and 3 will be welcome.
Please add netdev@oss.sgi.com to the Cc: list as it is probably/almost
surely related to the driver itself.
