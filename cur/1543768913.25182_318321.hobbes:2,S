There is a bug somewhere that makes it sometimes expire faster.
I found only one bug so far - touch_nmi_watchdog has a race
(fixed now in -mm*).  You can try if it still happens with the next -mm.
Somehow i doubt it is the race though because it should
be too unlikely to trigger this. Could be some other bug
too.
