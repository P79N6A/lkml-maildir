Sorry,
I probably shouldn't have brought my driver up,
its just confusing things. =)
Greg C is not running any of my out-of-tree drivers,
or even using one of our (Digi) boards.
I just saw his warning/error, and noticed it was the same as what I saw
back when 2.6.18 was released, so I figured I would hop in and
explain what I did to fix the problem in my driver...
(BTW, the error turns up a few times in a google of...
"don't try to register things with the same name in the same directory."
I wonder if all the "tty" ones are all related...)
In Greg C's case, he turned on *all* the serial options in "make config",
because he wasn't sure which serial card he had...
Turns out that the driver/char/isicom.c driver claimed his board, and then
tried to register the ttyM0 name, which apparently someone else
in the kernel did already...
You have a good point tho, we probably should actually look at /dev/ttyM0
on his system, and see who is actually claiming it already...
