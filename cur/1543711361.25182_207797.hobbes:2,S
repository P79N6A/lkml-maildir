Yes, and no. USB keyboard/mouse emulation is simply broken in most
BIOSes. It's even more broken on AMD64 BIOSes, because usually noone
tests its interaction with 64-bit longmode. And thus when it is invoked
in 64-bit longmode, it crashes the machine.
On x86 it just causes problems with PS/2 mouse and keyboard.
So it's caused by the same thing, but these are two different problems.
