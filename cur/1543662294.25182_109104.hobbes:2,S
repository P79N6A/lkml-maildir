Ahh, ok. That sounds quite doable, and all my complaints go away.
It still leaves the debug exception and NMI issue.
The debug exception case is easy to trigger: use gdb to single-step
through the user-lebel fast system call code, and you _will_ get a debug
exception on the very first kernel instruction (which is also the one
that doesn't have a valid stack). 
So anybody want to actually try to implement this?
