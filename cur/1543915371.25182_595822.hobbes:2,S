Can we please stop this *idiotic* thread.
Nick, you and some others seem to be arguing based on a totally flawed 
base, namely:
 - we can guarantee anything at all in the VM
 - we even care about the 16kB blocksize
 - second-class citizenry is "bad"
The fact is, *none* of those things are true. The VM doesn't guarantee 
anything, and is already very much about statistics in many places. You 
seem to be arguing as if Christoph was introducing something new and 
unacceptable, when it's largely just more of the same.
And the fact is, nobody but SGI customers would ever want the 16kB 
blocksize. IOW - NONE OF THIS MATTERS!
Can you guys stop this inane thread already, or at least take it private 
between you guys, instead of forcing everybody else to listen in on your 
flamefest.
