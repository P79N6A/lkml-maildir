Hmm, I'm not sure what you are referring to here.

This is also strange, as when I use patch to apply a patch to files not
checked out, patch asks me if I should check them out in write mode
(which I do, of course).
Of course, if you are using patch to apply changes to a BK tree it isn't
really BK in the end.  What I was referring to was importing a changeset
would probably get the target files correct 100% of the time, unlike the
situation you are describing with patch.
Cheers, Andreas
