It does show up under /proc/163, for whatever that's worth.
Going through the list of processes dumped by SysRq-t, here are the
ones I didn't knowingly start myself:
aio/0
ata/0
ata_aux
ent:md1.
events/0
ib_addr
ib_cm/0
ib_mcast
iw_cm_wq
kacpid
kblockd/0
kcryptd/0
khelper
khpsbpkt
kmirrord
kmpathd/0
kprefetchd
kpsmoused
kseriod
ksnapd
ksuspend_usbd
kswapd0
kthread
ktxnmgrd:md1:
ktxnmgrd:sda1
md2_raid1
pdflush
rdma_cm
reiserfs/0
scsi_eh_0 
watchdog/0
And khubd is still showing up as a major CPU consumer.  Interestingly,
ent:sda1! is also absent from the SysRq-t listing, though present (and
using lost of CPU) according to 'top' (ps, oddly, hangs in 'D' state
after listing some processes).
