I have searched which patch is the culprit.
I appears that the 2.6.17.3 kernel is OK and the 2.6.17.4 is showing the
problem..

                                break;
                        }
I've checked and this is really the culprit.
Recompiling the 2.6.17.7 whith the patch reversed got the kernel on
track again.
I can't figure why this cause the problem.
Can you have an explanation for this ?
