We use rsync to do our backups. I've been getting lines in my backup
server kernel and dmesg like this:
TCP: Treason uncloaked! Peer 10.1.1.40:37859/873 shrinks window
2430745930:2430747378. Repaired.
TCP: Treason uncloaked! Peer 10.1.1.40:37859/873 shrinks window
2430745930:2430747378. Repaired.
I was able to successfully reproduce this error in a test setup, but not
the crashes. I'm curious if maybe I just start up too many instances of
rsync and see what happens.
Any particular method or size of files, etc, in reproducing this would
be greatly beneficial. TIA
