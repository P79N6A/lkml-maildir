I use assembler when I need to do things 'C' doesn't want
to do.. like:
.section .init.data
.global foo
.type foo,@object
.size foo,11
foo: .string	"1234567890"
This will work for ".sections" like .data, etc,. but the
object file in empty when I use .init.data. This is probably
because gas treats .string specially. I know you can do this
with ".byte". You don't have to make the assembly by hand.
I do something like:
#ifdef THIS_WILL_NEVER_BE_DEFINED
char foo[]="This is the string..."
#else
extern char foo[];
#endif
I write a 'C' program that looks for "THIS_WILL_NEVER_BE_DEFINED"
and writes gas assembly for the strings up to the "#else".
I do this in an embedded system to put many/most/all strings
in NVRAM PROM.
