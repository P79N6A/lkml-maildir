 <<pty_close-race-fix.patch>> There is a race condition int pty.c 
when pty_close wakes up waiter on its pair device before set
TTY_OTHER_CLOSED flag.
It is possible on SMP or preempt kernel, waiter wakes up too early that
it will not get TTY_OTHER_CLOSED flag then fall into sleep again.
Lu hong jiu report this bug will hang some expect scripts on SMP
machines.
