Hello all
Tonight I finally got around to compiling 2.3.7, after being unable to
boot 2.3.6.  Booted fine, Gnome loaded fine, looking good.  I decided to
run bonnie with a test size of 130M IIRC (I have 128M physical, equal
swap).   During the test I was getting literally thousands of lines like
the two below (the exact numbers varied a bit):
Jun 21 22:17:38 spiritwalk kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device 
Jun 21 22:17:38 spiritwalk kernel: 03:06: rw=0, want=50462977, limit=514048 
Bonnie quit with a segfault (no core dump), so I restarted it, promptly
getting a bus error and an oops in the logs, which follows below.  I
attempted to exit X and only received many oopsen in response (one oops
for every window running, it seems).  These are available upon request, I
didn't want to clutter this message.  Magic-SysRq worked and I was able to
reboot cleanly, but decided to boot with a root floppy and fsck.  Lo and
behold I had quite a few problems on my root partition, and a few on
another.
System is a PII-350, 128M ram, drive is an IBM-DTTA-371010 (IDE).
Please cc me as I am not on the list.  
Thank you
Jamie
