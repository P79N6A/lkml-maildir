Look at the definition of __{start,stop}__ksymtab and recall C pointer 
arithmetics ;) (i.e. if I understood your comment right)

Yes, I think at some point I should take a look at patching genksyms so 
that the post-processing above is not necessary anymore. However, it 
doesn't hurt much, performance-wise.

Sure, send a patch ;)

It's not really necessary, but it still gives a hint that we're building
.o files. It should reallyyyy be %.o: $(%-objs), only that make doesn't
like that.

No, cmd_link_module links single- and multi-part modules (.o->.ko) now, 
that's why it got the more generic name.
