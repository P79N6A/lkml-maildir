<HTML><BODY BGCOLOR="#408080"></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B>93% WHO RESPOND TO MY AD DON'T MAKE THE CUT!<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Only highly motivated people should call)<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>I'm dead serious! Now let me tell you why...<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Most people don't have <U>drive</U>! They sit around waiting for something to happen.<BR>
They see that other people have nice homes, new cars, and MONEY, but why can't they?<BR>
They basically feel sorry for themselves, and I can't help these people!<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Another reason people are not qualified...<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>They are skeptical. BUT, the truth is, they are skeptical of themselves!<BR>
They don't have the <U>courage</U> to break their routine.<BR>
They are comfortable with their set hours, their set pay, and their set future.<BR>
I was not comfortable with someone controlling my future,<BR>
and I'm not comfortable working with people who are!</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11>STOP</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>If you are anything like the above, we won't be able to work together!<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11>WHAT DO THE 7% WHO DO MAKE THE CUT DISCOVER?!<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>People I select through an "interview like" process are forever changed!<BR>
They are opened to a world around them that they didn't know existed.<BR>
In fact, it's a world that has existed <U>around</U> them their whole lives,<BR>
but was purposely hidden from them!</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>How would you like to...<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- Drastically <U>reduce</U> personal, business and capital gains taxes?<BR>
- Protect <U>all</U> assets from any form of seizure, liens, or judgments?<BR>
- Create a <U>six figure</U> income every 4 months?<BR>
<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>How about...<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Restoring and preserving complete personal and financial<U> privacy</U>?<BR>
Amassing personal <U>wealth</U>, multiplying it and protecting it?<BR>
Realizing a 3 to 6 times <U>greater return</U> on your money?<BR>
<U>Legally</U> making yourself and your assets completely judgment-proof,<BR>
lien-proof, divorce-proof, attorney-proof, IRS-proof?<BR>
I could go on...</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT YOUR LIFE<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Do you think you are paid what you are worth?<BR>
Will you be set to retire in the next few years?<BR>
Do you control the course of your day? ...your life?<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>The fact is we have many people in our enterprise that earn over 50K per month<BR>
from the privacy of their own homes, and are retiring in 2 to 3 years (wealthy)<BR>
and have total freedom - both personal and financial!<BR>
<BR>
Many have been <U>conditioned</U> to believe it must be illegal, immoral or unethical<BR>
to ever earn any real profits from our efforts.<BR>
<BR>
The <U>sad truth</U> is, it's been designed that way by the ultra-rich<BR>
and ultra-powerful since before any of us were born!</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Who am I?<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>I'm a BIG thinker, a BIG dreamer, and I believe that I deserve the best that life has to offer.<BR>
I answered an ad much like the one you are reading now,<BR>
and was eager to hear what it was about.<BR>
<BR>
I knew that I couldn't invest only a few bucks and spend an hour or two<BR>
per week to achieve the results I was looking for.  I found the right information<BR>
and now I control my own destiny!<BR>
<BR>
If you are interested in radically changing your thoughts and your financial future,<BR>
I invite you to call TOLL FREE:</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11>1 800 707 4817<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>My name is Krystina, and I look forward to working with some of you!<BR>
<BR>
* REMEMBER *<BR>
<BR>
I can't do it for you, but I can show you exactly how I do it.<BR>
It's as simple as that!</B></P></HTML>
