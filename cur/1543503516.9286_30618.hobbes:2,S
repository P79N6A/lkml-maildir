Subject: [2.2.x] Obscure framebuffer bug

I can't reproduce this on command but it originally happened
with the TGA framebuffer code and I went digging to see where
this bug was popping up but nothing obvious showed up.
I kept it in the back of my mind and then it happened on my
main x86 box with the matrox framebuffer (w/ g200).
Basic rundown of how to try to reproduce it:
Top of the screen is fairly empty.
You are typing in bash, a line that is longer that the width
of the screen (you are one line above or on the bottom of the
screen).
Instead of using backspace, you use your arrow keys to go from
the bottom line to the line above it. When this happens, the
line in question gets redrawn at a random position on the bottom
of the screen.
This has happened since 2.2.0 if I remember right.
