patches often isn't a problem, the kernel seems to handle that just fine
:)

Hm, probably.  I'll add that also, I think it is good to point to the
real trees, as people do want to know that at times and this information
isn't listed anywhere (as evident by the ammount of digging I had to do
to find these trees...)

I'm not meaning to duplicate anything, as we don't have "location of
development git/quilt tree" entry in the MAINTAINERS file.  Hm, that
does sound like the proper place for such an entry, doesn't it?  Anyone
want to propose that addition?
