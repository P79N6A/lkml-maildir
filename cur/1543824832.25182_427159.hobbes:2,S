I respectfully disagree with that logic.  If its a key hot path -- which 
it is, every modern network or disk I/O runs through these paths -- then 
it deserves at least _some_ consideration before adding more CPU cycles.

As the author noted, it was only used in early platform bring-up.  And 
simply reviewing the patch... it is clear that screwing up the 
parameters would cause massive, noticeable problems immediately -- such 
as on EM64T with swiotlb.
