a) Limit the number of open files.
b) Don't do that then.

Therefore you should purposely increase the mess up to the point where the
system is guaranteed not to work? IMO you should rather put the other issues
onto the TODO list.
BTW: I'm not sure a hard limit is the right thing to do for mmu systems,
I'd rather implement high and low watermarks; if one pool is larger than
it's high watermark, it will be next get it's pages evicted, and it won't
lose pages if it's at the lower watermark.

Preallocating the page cache (and maybe the slab space?) may very well be
the right thing to do for nommu systems. It worked quite well in DOS times
and on old MACs.
