Subject: Cannot compile 2.4.2-ac23 kernel

Hello anybody.
Today i applied A.COX's patch 2.4.2-ac23 on 2.4.0 kernel previsiously patched
with 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 patches.
Before everything used to compile well, but with this patch i get this
error message:
setup.c: In function `identify_cpu':
setup.c:2280: `tsc_disable' undeclared (first use in this function)
setup.c:2280: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
setup.c:2280: for each function it appears in.)
and compilation stops.
Did i do wrong, if i patched ac23 over clean 2.4.2, or should i have to patch
ac23 directly over 2.4.1 (2.4.0 ?). I tried both, but got lots of error
messages.
My current gcc:   2.95.3
           make:  3.79.1
           as:    2.10.90
CPU:       Intel P1 166 MMX
Can somebody help me, what did i do wrong ?
Thanks                                                                   B.
