Given that there is already some charter that says KS attendees vote...
isn't it best to retain that? Directives from above aside, you need
specifications on how to change voting procedure before changing it, no?
If those don't exist, then something vaguely similar in my country would
require a referendum I think.
Hasn't the KS committee / TAB board vote rigging conspiracy theory been
raised yet? Given they're not running a country, it would be great fun
to see the board getting corrupted and go off the rails ;) I'd vote for
them because if Ted has anything to do with it, I *know* we'll be having
KS in Hawaii ;)
