I have a fundamental problem with that: you don't validate a higher
reliability information against a lower one.  The chipset registers
are high reliability.  Modulo unknown hardware erratas and bugs in the
code (and accepting f0000000 is in practice a bug in the code, the
docs are starting to catch up with it too), the chipset *will* decode
mmconfig at the looked up address no matter what.  On the other side,
the ACPI data is bios generated, and that is well known to be horribly
unreliable.  Hell, if it was reliable we could just use the MFCG ACPI
table without questions.
So you can check the ACPI stuff for coherency (MFCG vs. the rest), you
can validate the ACPI stuff against the results of the lookup if you
want, but validating the lookup against ACPI is nonsensical.
  OG.
