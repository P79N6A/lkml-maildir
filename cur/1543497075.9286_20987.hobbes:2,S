Is direct device-to-device I/O always bad?  Many SCSI devices support
the SCSI "copy" command, which allows them to copy a range of blocks from
one SCSI device to another SCSI device.  It could be interesting to tell
a disk to back itself up to the tape drive, or to implement mirroring
by letting the disk do it.
