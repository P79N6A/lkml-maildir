I hastily responded to this with some invective of my own.
I wish to publicly apologize because I was just a bit hasty.
Dr. Reed is a principle contributer to networking as we
know it now, in particular, UDP. He is also known for
"Reed's Law," which points out a problem with the
scalability of large networks.
Of course, none of this means that he is right or wrong
about port 0x80 on these crappy Wintel machines.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
