The kernel (at least 2.0.x) recognizes also magic escape strings,
when echoed to screen, change the palette. I don't remember exactly the
sequence but something like "<esc>[RRGGBBP" where RR, GG and BB
are the primary colors (0x0..0xff) in hex. Possibly [ is actually ] (?).
The original palette can be restored with "<esc>[R". (This too 
is from my faulty memory...)
