^^^ Very first thing to do is try it without the nvidia module loaded and 
then reproduce the problem and post the same info from your logs again.
As long as the nvidia module is loaded most people will disregard the 
bugreport since the source for the module is not available so if it has 
anything to do with the problem at all it is more or less un-debugable. If 
the problem can be reproduced without the nvidia module loaded then the 
info is more useful.
