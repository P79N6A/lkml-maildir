I think I know why Andi is so much against backtraces: he has some log
filter listening on netconsole mailing him with suspicious log messages.
Apparently, that log filter is much too stupid to discern an
OOPS or OOM from softlockup and other informative backtraces even when
given a clear hint what it is.
Or maybe he's just underestimating user's ability to read. ;)
