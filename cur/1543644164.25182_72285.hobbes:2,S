Hello !!!
As Kevin, we also use the generic HDLC by patch. Moreover the PC300 driver is 
a patch too (it was oficially patched to the kernel just in the 2.5 serie). 
It would very good to have the new generic HDLC in the kernel 2.4 as most of 
our customers uses the 2.4 serie and most of them have no idea what is a 
patch. I don't see problems with the configuration utility because our 
customers install it from the sources provided by us and it is just a matter 
of change the sources.
kind regards
