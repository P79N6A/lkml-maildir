OK, I tried your .config and the same happened here - no console output and
huge amounts of disk I/O as the system was booting.  No filesystem problems
on reboot, however.
I couldn't immediately see the reason for this.  You have your whole input
layer configured as a module, perhaps that has upset things.
I suggest that you work on the config settings and find out what it is that
is causing the tty layer to not come up.
