I am working with an HP Pavilion a1210n the mother board is
an ASUS A8AE-LE, which has an ATI IXP SB440 and a Realtek
ethernet controller. The processor is an AMD Athlon 64 3500+.
The USB controllers will not function unless ACPI is enabled
in the kernel.
If ACPI is enabled in the kernel the realtek ethernet is not
usable. If I do a ping to a working device on the same net,
I can see ARP requests going out and replies coming back.
However I get "host unreachable" error messages.
When looking at the interrupts in each case it appears to me
that there is an IRQ assignment problem. (my guess is the
Realtek driver) or is there something I am doing wrong??
Below are the contents of /proc/interrupts:
