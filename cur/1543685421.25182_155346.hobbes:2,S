I tried using it on pmac, but it causes hell with XFree. I'm not sure
what's up yet, I suspect it may be XFree still doing things after
calling the RELDISP ioctl but I'm not completely sure yet.
The setup XFree + DRI is working without switching to suspend console
(with only the apm_bios emulation for XFree to suspend/restore itself)
but not when switching to suspend console right before doing the apm
emulation callbacks (which should be ignored by X since it's no longer
the frontmost process at this point).
For some reason, it seems that after we have switched to the suspend
console, we race with the X server on accel engine, and on resume, the X
server just crashes.
Ben.
