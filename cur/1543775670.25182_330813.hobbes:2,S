Current git tip (2.6.12-rc1-git5) still does not compile for me:
  LD      usr/built-in.o
  AS      arch/xtensa/kernel/align.o
  AS      arch/xtensa/kernel/entry.o
/usr/src/ctest/git/kernel/arch/xtensa/kernel/entry.S: Assembler messages:
/usr/src/ctest/git/kernel/arch/xtensa/kernel/entry.S:1612: Error: invalid register number (83) for 'rsr' instruction
make[2]: *** [arch/xtensa/kernel/entry.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [arch/xtensa/kernel] Error 2
make: *** [_all] Error 2
I guess I'm using the wrong binutils version (2.15.94.0.2.2). Which is the
recommended gcc/binutils pair which is supposed to compile the kernel?
Reading specs from /usr/cc/xtensa/lib/gcc/xtensa-linux/3.4.4/specs
Configured with: ../configure --prefix=/usr/cc --exec-prefix=/usr/cc/xtensa
  --target=xtensa-linux --disable-shared --disable-werror --disable-nls
  --disable-threads --disable-werror --disable-libmudflap --with-newlib
  --with-gnu-as --with-gnu-ld --enable-languages=c
Thread model: single
gcc version 3.4.4 20050513 (prerelease)
GNU ld version 2.15.94.0.2.2 20041220
Thanks,
