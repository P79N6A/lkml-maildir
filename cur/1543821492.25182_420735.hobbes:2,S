When the u<n> things were done, uint<n>_t wasn't at all common.

That's not irrelevant. Usually you want to have stuff in header files that 
you use in source code. You want the two to visually look similar. It's a 
hell of a lot less confusing to use "u32" (in source) and "__u32" (in the 
header file), than it is to mix "uint32_t" (in source) and some random 
other thing (in header file).

And that wasn't what I objected to. 
What I objected to was that other part, which said that "uint32_t" was 
somehow more standard.
IN THE KERNEL IT IS _LESS_ STANDARD.
And outside the kernel, that documentation is not exactly relevant.
