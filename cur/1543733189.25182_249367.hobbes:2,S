APM must be fixed, too, since it does the same trick. Patch attached (adding 
comments to explain the synchronize_kernel() call).

Both APM and ACPI set pm_idle, and both can be modular. It seems, however, 
they are the only such ones. And since they APM and ACPI refuse to be both 
loaded, we cannot have (actually) two modules which override pm_idle. So 
you're right.

Add the synchronize_kernel() call, to let the idle thread see the newly set
value of pm_idle before the module is unloaded.
Also explain this both here and in drivers/acpi/processor.c with a comment.
