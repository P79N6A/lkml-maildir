Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Sorry I forgot to send this fix in with the 2 patches I submitted
yesterday. We found a bug in the ASIC used on the 64xx Smart Array
controllers. When prefetching from host memory we grab an extra 750 or
so bytes of data. If this occurs on a memory boundary the machine will crash.
This is primarily an issue on IPF and Alpha systems although it could happen
on other platforms. Proliant systems are not affected by this bug because
memory is contiguous and the top 4k of memory is masked off by the system
firmware. The solution to the problem is to disable SCSI prefetch in the
controller firmware. This results in a performance hit on x86 during RAID1
operations. This patch turns on prefetch for x86 based systems only.
Please consider this patch for inclusion in the 2.4.24 kernel.
This patch should be applied after the 2 I submitted yesterday. It will
patch into a fresh tree with offsets.
Thanks,
mikem
