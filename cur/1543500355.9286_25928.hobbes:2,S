Did you also stop to think that the interface was broke *intentionally*.
With the pagecache changes, filesystems were intentionally broken to
prevent them from compiling and corrupting filesystems far and wide. ext2
worked of course as that is what most people are using.  And like with the
dcache changes in the 2.1.x kernels ext2 was the model for other
filesytems.

To tell you the truth I don't think Linus really cares too much about FAT
filesytems.  Hence the reason why FAT isn't really a speed daemon under
Linux.(Is FAT a speed daemon under anything?)  Seriously the whole reason
why they broke the filesystems is so that people can *FIX* them.
Either fix it or quit your whining and wait for somebody else to do it.

Do you really expect your bean counter to be running a development kernel?
Probably not.  He's going to be running the stock kernel for whatever
distribution he bought.
