You have greatly misunderstood the purpose of access control.
It is simply a way for the programmer to *express* himself more fully
on the subject of what should be touched when.  Expressiveness is good
-- especially expressiveness that can be checked mechanically (i.e. as
part of the language).
It's not about trust.  It's about making onesself clear.
