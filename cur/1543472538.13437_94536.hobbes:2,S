Hi there.
For reference, now that the winter term has finished here at the
University of Aberdeen, I've started reconstructing missing kernel
tarballs, and the ones I have reconstructed so far are included in the
latest version of my Linux Kernel Version History webpage.
However, due to Monolith shutting up shop, the URL for this page has
now moved, and the new URL is as follows:
 Q> 
http://ps.cus.umist.ac.uk/pub/rhw/kernel.versions.html
Note that with the kernels reconstructed so far, there is a complete
collection from kernel 1.1.70 to date, and earlier kernels will be
added as and when I reconstruct them...
My aim is to obtain and list a complete set of kernels from 0.01 to
date, but that won't be for a few days yet...
Best wishes from Riley.
