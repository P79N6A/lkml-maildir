Subject: [PATCH 1/8] driver core: fix up Kconfig text for CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/4/521

As things get moved into this config option, the hard date of 2006 does
not work anymore, so update the text to be more descriptive.
