Well.  Bear in mind that the dentry used to be 256 bytes on a 128 byte
boundary so there was really nothing to improve, unless you were using a
PIII or something.
But I just made it 160 bytes on a 16-byte boundary, so some dentries will
now stradddle cachelines.  We need to identify the used fields on the
lookup path and try to scrunch them into a 16-byte-aligned 16-byte chunk. 
I'll have a go at that.
