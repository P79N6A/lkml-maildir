I've been playing with different approaches, (still all hot cache
though), and inspecting the generated code. It's not that the gcc
generated code is always better for the normal case. But since it sees
more and everything is not hidden in asm, it can optimise what is being
used, and how it's used.

Well, I never said I was a test benchmark writer :-).  If you know of a
better way to benchmark these, then let me know.  I also thought that
having all in a hot cache could help with showing the differences.  But
I guess I would need to test this in other ways.

I've just finished a version of find_first_zero_bit too.  It has the
same comparisons as the find_first_bit but not as drastic. Do you want
this too, and if so, as a separate patch on top of the first one, or
against 2.6.12.2 (that's the kernel I'm working with right now) or do
you want me to submit a new patch with both changes?
