many people don't have better ways to do accounting than this.
in the case of Squid and Linux, they're typically using it because its 
open-source and "free".
they want to use HTTP Caching to save bandwidth (and therefore save money), 
but they also live in a regime of volume-based billing.  (not everywhere on 
the planet is fixed-$/month for DSL).
the unfortunate solution is to use HTTP Transaction logs, which count 
payload at layer-7, not payload+headers+retransmissions at layer-3.

i don't need it because i already have it in my kernel.
but thats where it ends -- its destined to forever be a private patch.
