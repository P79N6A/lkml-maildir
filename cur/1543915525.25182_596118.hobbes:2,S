Just a though - what about allowing secondary addresses with the same
address as main one? I.e. change bit of the core code to allow creating
aliases with the same address as main device, so that you would be able
to create ':iw' alias during rdma device initialization?
If this solution is not acceptible, then I belive your alias change is
the way to go.
