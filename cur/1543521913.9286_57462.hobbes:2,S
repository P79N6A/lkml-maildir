Same here. While on the subject of the client, has anybody else 
experienced any of these (minor) bugs/irritants?
(1) Occasional register dumps when nntpserver (not ANU) has problems 
    (presumably corrupt spool/history list etc.)
(2) Sometimes fails to mark as read a crossposted article encountered
    later in another group in a news reading session. Articles are
    genuinely crossposted (ie. Identical Message-ID). 
(3) Won't do a read/topic or read/identifier - says article was not found.
    This has something to do with a bug in INN2.2 which my server runs,
    which does not return the article number from the head command. Eg.
    For read/identifier ANU news sends the command, 
HEAD <message-id>
and gets back the response,
221 0 head <message-id>
and then attempts to look up ARTICLE number 0 which of course does not 
exist.
The thing I cannot remember, is whether read/topic worked with previous 
versions of INN on which read/identifer did work...
Tom.
