Jamie, doing that is not a real problem. The fact is that sys_epoll aimed
to solve issues where scalability on huge number of fds is involved. By
covering sockets ( network connections ) and pipes ( cgi execution ) you
have a pretty wide scalability addressing. Usually you know from where and
fd born, so you're typically able to handle it correctly. Those reasons,
togheter with the fact that I did not want to introduce revolutions in the
kernel, drove me to limit the sys_epoll coverage to sockets and pipes.
