Will fix that in next patch. My focus was on the concept when I did the
patch but it is dead easy to fix for ll archs at once.

Good suggestion - will use these.

I need to play a little with this before I make up my mind.
I do not like the concpet of hiding the const too much - it will
be non-obvious why the compiler complains if the only thing that
distingush const from non-const is a small capital 'c' within
__cpucinitdata (versus __cpuinitdata).
It can always be an incremental patch as my concpet does not prevent
it and we have only a few const __initdata variables.
