2.2.12 sees only 64 of 128mb ram.
i updated the bios on an abit be6 motherboard and the kernel only
saw 64 of 128mb ram in the box. the bios and other OS still saw all
of the memory. backing out the bios update fixe[ds] the problem.
kernel 2.0.36 ha[ds] same symptom. 
this is reproducible behavior. could it indicate a problem in mm/init?
or did abit just release a bunk bios? i have no clue where to start 
debugging this. i'll provide any info to assist in hunting this down.
