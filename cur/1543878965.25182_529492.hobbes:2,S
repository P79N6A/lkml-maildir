We're tracking it here (bug 12010 on our internal bugzilla), and it's on 
my list to get done "soon".  I'm currently in the middle of some other 
bug fixes, but when I get to a good stopping point, I'll get this fixed. 
  Shouldn't be too difficult.
If you'd like to track it yourself, feel free to open an OpenFabrics 
bug.  I'll update the bug when I get a patch done.
Regards,
  Robert.
