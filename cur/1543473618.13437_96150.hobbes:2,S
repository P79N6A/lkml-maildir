First try passing the idex= and hdx= parameters to the kernel.
If this works then you know the ide-driver will at least attempt to
work with your new toy.
If it is a pci add-on card, then edit-n-add to ./drivers/block/ide-pci.c
an identifier like.......
#define DEVID_DOC2000 ((ide_pci_devid_t){vender_id_number,device_id_number})
static ide_pci_device_t ide_pci_chipsets[] __initdata = {
/* snip */
  {DEVID_DOC2000, "DOC2000", NULL, {{0x00,0x00,0x00},{0x00,0x00,0x00}}, 
    OFF_BOARD, 0 },
/* snip */
Otherwise start hacking..........
