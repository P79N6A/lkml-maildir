You still kept Venki's redundant 32bit reference count change for 32bit.
The code handled that already by doing reserved bits check.
IMHO it would have been cleaner to also do that for the 64bit version
instead of abusing the reference counting for this (like my
"CPA Handle 4K split pages at boot on 64bit" patch did).

Ok I'll redo it. Thank you for your support.
Probably in larger chunks now though -- with your somewhat
random patching applying methology larger small grained series are just too 
painful for me.
First priority will be gbpages on top of it.
I would appreciate if you could either prevent or warn against further
wide scale changes on these files before .26 then -- otherwise I'll have
again play catch up with a relatively large patchkit.

They seem to be all independent from a quick look.

Yes I'll do a patch later. I had wanted to fix it over the weekend, but
was fighting instead with all the other problems that were in git-x86 
at that time.
