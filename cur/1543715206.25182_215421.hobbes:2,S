By the way, until the atkbd.c / keyboard.c interaction is fixed, using setkeycodes might 
*not* make the keys known *properly*. (example: try setkeycodes e001 129: you'll notice 
that a key whose raw code is 0x81 will not produce keycode 129, because the raw mode 
emulation will actually turn the 0x81 in a 0x85.)
(See also the temporary patch I posted recently).
