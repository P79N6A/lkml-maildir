I usually without the == in these cases:
  if (pointer)  // test for non-0.
  if (condition)
  if (condition-valued-variable)
but not in these (although I am not very consistent):
  if (integer != 0)
  if (char != 0)
When using bool, I'm happy to write "if (X)" where X is a truth value
indicating a condition that has been tested, but if X were used as an
enumeration of truth values e.g. as in a theorem prover or a logic
simulator, I would tend to write ==, for example:
  if (X == true && ptr && *ptr > 1)
The point being to illustrate the intent of the test (i.e. is it a
boolean test or a comparison against a point in a range of values), not
simply for it to be semantically correct.
Just to break that rule, however, if p were a pointer and x were an
integer, I would write:
  x = (p != 0);
rather than
  x = p;
:-)
