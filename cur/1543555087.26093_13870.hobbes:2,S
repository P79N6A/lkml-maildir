Interestingly enough, I get it on a VIA MVP3 with 2.2.18pre + bkz's patch.
Since it's eaten two filesystems by now, I'm not overly eager to play
with it again... On a second thought though, I'd rather play with it now
in a controlled environment, so feel free to send the patch my way.
If you want details, just ask.
Thanks,
Ion
