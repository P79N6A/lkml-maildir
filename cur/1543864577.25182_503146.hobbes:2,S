Well, Usenix has offerred to provide logistical support for some
mini-summits if anyoen wants to take them up on it.  Using some of the
sponsorship money from last year, we've proposed to make some hotel
conference rooms right before OLS available if anyone wants to do a
10-30 person mini-summit in Ottawa.
Is there any interest?
