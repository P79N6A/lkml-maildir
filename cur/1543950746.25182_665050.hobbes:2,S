Well, with or without shock protection it can't get any worse by then,
can it? But in all those cases where the system manages to get the heads
of the platter in time, the owner may be greatful for this feature.

A starting point it is then.

This business of aborting commands is exactly what I haven't a clue
about. At first I thought I could do something similar to
ata_do_link_abort but I obviously want to avoid the need for a soft
reset before issuing idle immediate. How am I to go about it?

Basic queue freezing certainly will. But we'll need attributes specific
to ATA so the user can determine whether
1. idle immediate should be issued (if supported) on queue freeze
   events;
2. idle immediate is supported on this particular device even though
   dev->id doesn't say so;
3. idle immediate is malfunctioning and should be avoided even though
   dev->id reports support for that feature;
4. (perhaps we should drop that): use standby immediate if idle
   immediate isn't supported for some reason.
I'm going to send a first draft of a patch series in reply to this
email. It is a stripped down version intended to get the general idea
across. The first of these four patches will eventually need to be
modified to actually abort in flight commands and clear up the mess
afterwards. However, first and foremost I'd like to draw your attention
to the use of REQ_TYPE_LINUX_BLOCK requests as demonstrated in the other
three patches. The question is whether the underlying concept is right.
Although the question how to handle REQ_TYPE_LINUX_BLOCK requests in the
scsi subsystem has been raised on the linux-scsi ml, it has never been
answered really because this request type was deemed unsuitable for the
application in question. See, for instance, the thread starting at [1].
My patch approach has been partly inspired by the patch discussed there.
Before I raise this issue yet again, I'd like to know whether
REQ_TYPE_LINUX_BLOCK is the right choice for my application in your
opinion or whether another mechanism might be more suitable as James
suggested a while ago (see [2]).

Elias
