"a config option" is a cop-out. By proposing a config option you even
admit it's not essential for userspace. The last thing this should be is
a config option; it either is needed and important, and should be there
always, or it's redundant and should be done in userspace. "A config
option" is just admitting that it is the later, but that you need to
justify the time you spent on the kernel patch somewhere ;-)
