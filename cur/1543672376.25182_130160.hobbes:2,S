# hdparm -v /dev/hdc
/dev/hdc:
 HDIO_GET_MULTCOUNT failed: Invalid argument
 IO_support   =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 BLKRAGET failed: Invalid argument
 HDIO_GETGEO failed: Invalid argument
using_dma means it's using dma for transfer, right?
