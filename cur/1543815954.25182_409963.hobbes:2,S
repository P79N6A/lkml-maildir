Hello,
Below, I've forwarded change from 2.6.16 which I think may causes 
problems for applications that use setsockopt with SO_RCVBUF. We are 
using an implementation of an iSCSI target and according to network 
sniffs it seems that during data transfer the receive window 
unjustifyingly shrinks to a very low size (180 bytes). I can guess
that the code below indirectly affects the receive window size, but 
I'm not sure how it the logic works here, a clarification could be
helpful.
It's worth to mention that we have sysctl_tcp_moderate_rcvbuf=1, but 
I don't think it should interfere with applications that request to 
have a fixed receive buffer by the means of setsockopt(). I can also 
tell by experiment that reverting the change below makes the problem 
go away.
