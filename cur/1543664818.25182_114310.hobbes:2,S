Hi,
     while browsing through fs/select.c file of 2.4.19, I came across two 
DIFFERENT ways of changing the state of the current task in do_select(): 
            set_current_state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
     AND    current->state = TASK_RUNNING; 
I am curious to know if the second line of code doesn't cause any problem in 
SMP systems.  I also see the same situation in do_poll(). 
Please cc to my id since I am not subscribed to the mailing list. 
Thanks
Prashanth
