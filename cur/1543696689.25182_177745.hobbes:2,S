This is what  I thought, too.
Why did it work with serio_rescan() or serio_reconnect() but not with 
the one above?
But on second thought, I didn't know how the kernel works, not then. Not 
now. So when it works for me, my lazy brain, said. That's enough.  ;-)

Nope. At least, I didn't wait that long. (I hate seeing lots of "lost 
sync" messages in my console forever, so I always reboot. And in X, you 
just get un-moveable mouse.)

Personally, I don't think it makes any sense.
If something is broken. Why do I need to see lots of funny messages 
(which I didn't even know what it means) if then it could be fixed. Or 
is it has something to do with other serio devices?

I thought so, too.
But how do you pass to modprobe something that does not available as 
Module in menuconfig?
