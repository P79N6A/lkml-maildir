A couple of days ago, I was thinking about a common hash table
implementation, ala include/linux/list.h. Then I came across
include/linux/ghash.h, and thought that someone's already done it.
After that I noticed the copyright line said 1997, and a quick check
in cscope showed that nobody's including it.
Does anyone know if this file is worth studying and working with? I
have to wonder if nobody's using it after four years.
Does anyone see a problem with a common hash table implementation?
I've implemented a few hash tables from scratch for our clustering
work, and it's starting to get a little old. Something easy to use
like list.h would be a lot nicer.
