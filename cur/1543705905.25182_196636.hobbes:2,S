Thank you.

OK.
The benefit is simple.
Before applying your patch, the system became hardly responsive
under a certain situation (that is no free swap space, running page cache
intensive applications).
The system time went up 80-100% for long time (30 minutes to hours).
After applying your patch, under the same situation, the responsiveness
of the system does not get worse.
The system time goes up high for a few seconds, but it goes down soon.

I feel your approach is better than mine to keep the current semantics.
Best regards.
