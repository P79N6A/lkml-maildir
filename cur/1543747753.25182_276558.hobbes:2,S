Hello Dimitri,
thanks for your check. As I understand the code (it took me
5 hours eh eh) only relative sizes of cpu_power within one
domain matter. Thus in isolated domain one can use any nonzero
value. Also SCHED_LOAD_SCALE is probably ok in principle because
the value means "power of one typical CPU" AFAIK.
I'm not sure who is official maintainer of the scheduler and
whether he will see/integrate the patch ...
