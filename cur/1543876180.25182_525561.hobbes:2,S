eventfd_signal() assumes that the passed in file* refers to an eventfd
file.  So if a caller passes in a file* for /etc/passwd, the kernel will go
splat.
I guess that's caveat emptor, and any violations of that will show up
quickly in testing.  My main concern would be that there might be some way
for a naughty user to force the kernel to pass a non-eventfd file* into
this function.  That depends upon as-yet-unwritten code - is there a risk
of this happening, and how do we prevent it?

spose so.  I think architectures _should_ implement 64-bit get_user() and
put_user() nowadays.  So you could leave the code as-is and inform the arch
maintainers, if you're feeling keen.
If all this code has its own Kconfig options then the architectures won't
break until their maintainers come along to enable the new features, so
they'll implement 64-bit get_user() at that time and things will all unfold
in a nicely non-chaotic fashion.
