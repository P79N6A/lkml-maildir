I'm currenly porting the OpenMoko patchset to 2.6.23-rc8. We are using
psplash and kdrive. When booting, I got an error from psplash about
being unable to switch consoles. Strangely, it was possible to start
kdrive manually. So i set up qemu for kernel debugging, set some
interesting breakpoints and then saw that it was scheduling away
directly after the kill_pid. Then it was quite obvious.
It was triggering every time, on the device and in qemu identically.
Most people testing the RCs probably don't run psplash (or any other
program which sets vt_mode.mode to VT_PROCESS), so it wasn't noticed
earlier.
