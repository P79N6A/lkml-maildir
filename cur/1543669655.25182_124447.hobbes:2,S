I do wonder how we're going to run the 46KW of power (Assuming these
drives pull similar to the drive i just checked) down the line.
Should we use solid copper bars in a bus setup?  You'll be pulling 2000
amps off the 5v, and 3000 off the 12V.  We may wish to rethink the method
of hooking up our 46000 watt power supply.  I suspect a bus may be a
better way, and probably easier to setup and maintain.
And much more fun when you drop a screwdriver across it.
