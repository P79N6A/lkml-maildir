Until the kernel delete/add route code gets fixed so there are
not duplicate routes necessitating duplicate deletes until they
are finally gone, here is a patch to net-tools `route`. This will
help administrators who have large numbers of machines and don't
want to have to rewrite a lot of scripts.
This is against net-tools 1.47
Route 1.94
