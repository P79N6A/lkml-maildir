vfat is a proprietary windows-only format. Why are we supporting it?
If we do then lets make it as easy to use as possible including symlinks.

No one cannot untar a source tarball with symlinks in a vfat fs without
the patch. We cannot live with foo.lnk. Its insane not to carry over the
semantics as much as possible.

vfat is the only fs that can be shared between microsoft oses and linux.
umsdos mangles filenames and does other ugly things. umsdos is an example
of what not to do with a fs. umsdos is a hack. vfat+symlinks is the
completion of an implementation.
