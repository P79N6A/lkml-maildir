Since Linux is starting to be used in many 'strange' non-desktop
environments, maybe it's time to provide a hook to reserve the
top N kilobytes of RAM for strange buffers. Like:
	append="..,reserve=2M".
Upon startup, a pointer, valid when using the kernel DS, could be
initialized to point to the beginning of this area. This is essentially
zero overhead for the kernel because it just points to one longword
greater than the RAM the kernel will use.
In the event that this is too much work, then an additional entry could
be made in the GDT to address this area, and the resulting segment
number could be included in a kernel header file. To access it, code
would do:
	push	ds
	movl	$RESERVE_MEM, %eax
	movl	%eax,ds
	.....
	DS:[0] now points to its beginning.
	pop	ds
This 'free' area could be used for all kinds of stuff including helping
to relocate/debug come complex things.
The cost to performance is zero. A GDT entry on Intel is 8 bytes.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
