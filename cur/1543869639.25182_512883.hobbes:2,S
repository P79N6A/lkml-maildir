But it would probably be tuned specifically to its use case, which would mean 
inherently better performance.

Think of the kernel scheduler as a default fallback scheduler, for procs that 
are randomly queued.  Anytime you can identify a group of procs/threads that 
behave in a similar way, it's almost always best to do specific/private 
scheduling, for performance reasons.

Ok.  But what you are proposing here is a dynamically plugable scheduler that 
is extensible on top of that.
Sounds Great!
Thanks!
