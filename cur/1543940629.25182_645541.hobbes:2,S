Ok, I didn't bother to check the specs, as I think your main argument
is that these options vary from controller to controller, so we need to
make this extensible.
Not all options are specific to DMA slave transfers either, although
most of them are probably more important in this context.
Descriptor-based vs. register-based transfers sounds like something the
DMA engine driver is free to decide on its own.

Is it enough to set these options on a per-channel basis, or do they
have to be per-transfer?

Yes, but I still think it's worthwhile to have a common interface to
common functionality. Drivers for hardware that does proper flow
control won't need to mess with priority and arbitration settings
anyway, although they could do it in order to tweak performance. So a
plain "write this memory block to the TX register of this slave"
interface will be useful in many cases.

Well, I can imagine copying scatterlists may be useful too. Also, some
controllers support "stride" (or "scatter-gather", as Synopsys calls
it), which can be useful for framebuffer bitblt acceleration, for
example.

I mostly agree, but I think providing basic DMA slave transfers only
through extensions will cause maintenance nightmares for the drivers
using it. But I suppose we could have something along the lines of
"core plus standard subclasses plus SOC-specific subclasses"...
We already have something along those lines through the capabilities
mask, taking care of the "standard subclasses" part. How about we add
some kind of type ID to struct dma_device so that a driver can use
container_of() to get at the extended bits if it recognizes the type?
