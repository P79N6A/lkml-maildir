Actually, you need to follow them a little closer if you want anyone to
help you. Perhaps you missed this paragraph in REPORTING-BUGS:
     If the failure includes an "OOPS:" type message in your log or on screen
     please read "Documentation/oops-tracing.txt" before posting your bug
     report. This explains what you should do with the "Oops" information to
     make it useful to the recipient.

What proprietary modules did you have loaded when this BUG() was hit? nVidia,
perhaps? Reproduce the problem from a cold boot without ever having loaded the
closed-source module(s). If you can't, go talk to whomever made the module; the
community cannot help you solve a problem when we can't see the code.
