Rik,
I remember Linus had a reasoning for the "scan _ALL_ ptes until success"
behaviour.
Linus, was that due to zone-specific (eg DMA shortage on bigmem machine)
shortages or ?
That _is_ one good argument (I'm still seeing the network driver not being
able to allocate memory from the DMA zone on the 16GB boxen), I think.
However, the current code breaks badly as I've tested on the 16GB boxen.
