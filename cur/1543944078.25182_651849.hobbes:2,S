I'm still showing occurrences in:
./Documentation/RCU/NMI-RCU.txt
./Documentation/kprobes.txt
./Documentation/uml/UserModeLinux-HOWTO.txt
./kernel/rcupdate.c
The last one is interesting:
/* FASTCALL no longer exists, this wrapper may no longer be needed */
static void wakeme_after_rcu(struct rcu_head  *head)
{
        struct rcu_synchronize *rcu;
        rcu = container_of(head, struct rcu_synchronize, head);
        complete(&rcu->completion);
}
The comment is rather ungrammatical/meaningless.  Perhaps it is trying
to tell us that we can remove this function now?
