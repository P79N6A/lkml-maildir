  I had some intial issues with my v3 mounts, but it appears that it was
related to hitting the ulimit on a make -j 16.  (It's nice to work for a
hardware company, and have access to an 8-way.)  In case since upping my
ulimit on the client kernel builds seem to work just with a server power
off in the middle.
  I generally run everything v2, and don't have the issue of non-linux
clients.  So I'm not sure how much help I can be.  I seem to remember
someone (you?) talking about v3 issues with SGI boxes under 2.4 on the
nfs list.  I didn't much pay much attention as it wasn't an issue I
could help with.
