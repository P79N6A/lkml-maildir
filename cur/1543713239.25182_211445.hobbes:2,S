- There's a ton of idle time there.
- The CPU scheduler is hurting.  Nick and Ingo are patching up a storm to
  fix a similar problem which Jeremy Higdon is observing at 200,000
  IOs/sec.  This will get better.
- That 60-disk LVM array is costing us in the new unplug and congestion
  code.  Jens, didn't you have a tune-up for that in the works?
- I'm surprised that you didn't see big gains from ext3-fsync-speedup,
  even though it appears that the test uses fdatasync().
