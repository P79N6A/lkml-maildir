Hi Chris
I understand you are looking for a generic iterator to operate on a set
of ptes within a given address range.
Unfortunately just about every iteration in the kernel now varies slightly
(usually at the pte directory level) in such a way that abstracting out
each iteration into generic iterators becomes somewhat problematic.
I classify them into read, build and dual iterators.
READ iterators: read a page table within a range and operate on the ptes
eg: unmap_page_range, change protection, msync ...
BUILD iterators: build a page table in a range while operating on the 
ptes.
eg: vmap_pte_range, remap_pfn_range, ...
DUAL iterators: read and build a page table within a range and operate on 
the ptes.
eg: copy_page_range (src and dst page tables different)
eg: mremap iterator (src and dst page tables the same)
A little over a year ago it was possible to abstract the iterators
into these classes because they were relatively untailored.  During the
last year a fair bit of customisation has occured on many iterators and
some additional iterations added.  Some of these iterators are performance
critical and their tailoring necessary.  The ones that are less important
would need to be tidied up so that abstraction to generic iterators can 
occur.
Because of the continual divergence of the iterators I have removed the
generic iterators where I would pass it a function across the interface
because they became too unweildy.
One possible solution is to have a set of critical and non critical 
iterators. The non critical iterators would comprise a generic read and 
build iterator.
However at this stage the Linux community seems relatively content to
access the page table data structure in an open fashion with tailored cut
and paste iterators.  This method does have its advantages but it makes
changing the page table implementation more difficult.
Cheers
Paul Davies
