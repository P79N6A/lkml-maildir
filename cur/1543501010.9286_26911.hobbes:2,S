there are two choices that can be made at kernel
compile time (at the moment) :
   - dump blindly the raw 16 kbytes at the beginning
     of the disk. This can be retrieved simply by
     "dd if=/dev/fd0 bs=512 count=32"
   - creating a tiny FAT12 on the disk and dump the
     data in a file named "messages.txt". Easier to
     read.
Any of the two methods DESTROY disk contents, but only
require one track. It can be easy to find a diskette
with useless contents. Even a damaged diskette can be
used if its first track is good.
The dump code is the same, it simply looks at a bit
in some flags to know if it must write a FAT or not.

yes and no ...
Pavel Machek told me that people might think that if
this system can use a FAT, then their disk contents
won't be lost, which is false of course. I think he's
right with this. That's the reason why I let the user
choose. Personnaly, I use FAT because I find it easier
to use, and I do know that my diskette contents will
be lost after each dump.
An improvement could be to dump messages each one after
the other so that we could have a diskette full of
kernel messages ... This implies to be able to read
FAT !
