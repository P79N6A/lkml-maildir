sys_call_table isn't an exported symbol.

The flaw is in attempting to modify the sys_call_table
with a module.

Even sys_mknod() should not work from a module; Who's
context did you steal to create that device-file? What
happens next to that poor sucker? Who's data-space
did you corrupt for the file-name string? I note that,
from the names, it's likely that you intend to do this
dastardly deed from a timer-queue!!!
File operations require a process context. The kernel doesn't
have one. All file operations should (read must) be done
from user space. The kernel is designed to do things
on behalf of user-space callers. Executing sys_* from
a module will result in somebody saying; "See, you are
wrong... It works fine!". Later on mysterious errors
occur which are un-trackable.
