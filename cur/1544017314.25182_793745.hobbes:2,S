what happens when you download the source?
then once unpacked issue ./firefox
just to see what happens without any plugins/apps.
over here I have the beta no apps
basically as light as possible just flash
(since all web sites use that.)
I did have a crash though,
but was due to me not allowing
an allow rule for SELinux(too lazy at the moment);
but besides any allow rules I'm not having any issues.
(knock on wood).
you can also try renaming gnome2 gconf  and
.mozilla just to see
