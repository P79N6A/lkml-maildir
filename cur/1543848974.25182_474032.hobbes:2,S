Thanks. However, before I throw it properly at Andrew for 2.6.20, what
do you think of a different approach: removing those 2 function pointers
and replacing them with a notifier ?
I find that with my refactoring of the DMA ops, I actually have various
bits of code (the pci layer, some platform bus code, etc...) that need
to "hook" there to create my auxilliary data structure depending, among
other, on the bus type, and I'd like to keep those functions well
separated in different files without inter-links.
Thus I'd rather have the interested bits be able to just register a
notifier and get called on device add and remove. Does it look like
something you could use too ?
Cheers,
Ben.
