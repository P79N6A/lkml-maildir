Shifting policy to userspace and the daemons involved. Which is where it should
be. The whole point of the mss option originally was to allow users to drop
the MSS of a path for better performance.

Correct. But think about transport mode

Its not breaking IP. 
To do IPSEC with DF does require a little kernel tweaking because the 
slack space for the crypto headers needs to be factored into the path mtu
computation. That can wait until after the basic solution
