i've written a prog interface for my logger utility to make it easy
to transport my logging information from kernel to userspace using
shell commands. now i want to use tail -f /prog/<mylogfile>. what
do i have to do for that to work. when using tail my loginfo gets
read form my ringbuffer, but nothing gets printed in the terminal.
