Ha -- I'd missed that because I hadn't spotted the addition of
devmem_is_allowed to /arch/i386/mm/init.c
I'm really rather pleased to see this attempt at disambiguating
what /dev/mem can be used for. What's nice from our POV is it now
explicitly prevents the cases that we couldn't easily support in
Xen.  We'd observed that nothing seemed to break, so presumed
they weren't very common.
The next logical step with that patch would be to have mmap_mem
call io_remap_page_range rather than remap_pfn_range, at which
point it would solve our problem. I'm not sure what this would
mean for architectures other than i386.
