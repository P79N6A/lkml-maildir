By optimal you seem to mean "generate fewer CPU cycles by risking use of 
an obsolete value," while by the same term I mean read the correct and 
current value from the memory location without the overhead of locks. If 
your logic doesn't require the correct value, why read it at all? And if 
it does, how fewer cycles and cache impact can anything have than a 
single register load from memory?
Locks are useful when the value will be changed by a thread, or when the 
value must not be changed briefly. That's not always the case.
