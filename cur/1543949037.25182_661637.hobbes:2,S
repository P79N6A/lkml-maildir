But the GPL only applies to derivative works.  Given that ndiswrapper 
loads binaries designed for another OS, doesn't that mean that it is 
unlikely that the binaries would be impacted by the GPL?
So the portion that is a derivative work (ndiswrapper itself) is GPL, 
and it loads something that is clearly not a derivative work.  From a 
licensing standpoint how is this different than an open-source driver 
loading a proprietary firmware?
Once ndiswrapper loads the binary blob the kernel should be considered 
tainted from a debuggability standpoint, but I have some sympathy for an 
argument suggesting that ndiswrapper should be able to use GPLONLY symbols.
