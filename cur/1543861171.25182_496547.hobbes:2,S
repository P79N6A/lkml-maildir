Another alternative is for the cq-index u32 memory to be allocated by
the kernel and mapped into the user process.  So the lib can read/write
it, and the kernel can read it directly.  This is the fastest way
perfwise, but I didn't want to do it because of the page granularity of
mapping.  IE it would require a page of address space (and backing
memory I guess) just for 1 u32.  The CQ element array memory is already
allocated this way (and its DMA coherent too), but I didn't want to
overload that memory with this extra variable either.  Mapping just
seemed ugly and wasteful to me. 
So given 3 approaches:
1) allow user data to be passed into ib_req_notify_cq() via the standard
uverbs mechanisms.
2) hide this in the chelsio driver and have the driver copyin the info
directly.
3) allocate the memory for this in the kernel and map it to the user
process.
I chose 1 because it seemed the cleanest from an architecture point of
view and I didn't think it would impact performance much.
Steve.
