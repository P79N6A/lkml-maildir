 There _is_ an exploit: 
http://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0013-mremap.txt
"Since no special privileges are required to use the mremap(2) system
call any process may misuse its unexpected behavior to disrupt the kernel
memory management subsystem. Proper exploitation of this vulnerability may
lead to local privilege escalation including execution of  arbitrary code
with kernel level access. Proof-of-concept exploit code has been created 
and successfully tested giving UID 0 shell on vulnerable systems."
Cheers,
