Good point.  If so, it probably makes most sense to split pad1 into two 
one-byte fields; one for ID and one for version.  The bootloader_type 
will have to continue to be (ID << 4)+basic_version; we can presumably 
add a bootloader_version file which can report a bigger ID.
Either that or we can expose the raw pad1 field as bootloader_exttype 
and force any users to be aware of the field splits.
