I had this problem, and I resolved it for me like this: In the
NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-5336-pkg?.run archive from Nvidia are multiple make
files. By default, my distro was using the make file "makefile" and it
stopped working. I switched to using "Makefile.kbuild", which is
oriented to 2.6 kernels, and it works again. Comments within
Makefile.kbuild touch on changes to module handling in 2.6 compared to
2.4.
