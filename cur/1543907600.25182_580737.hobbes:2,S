Yes, The timer set failed, but I think the problem maybe caused by my
wrong lpj command line parameter. If this is true, please just excuse
me for noise.
before the warning:
MP-BIOS bug : 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
trying to setup timer(IRQ0) through the 8259A ... failed
trying to setup timer as Virtual Wire IRQ ... failed
trying to setup timer as ExtINT IRQ
after the warning:
failed :
kernel panic - not syncing:
IO-APIC + timer doesn't work!
