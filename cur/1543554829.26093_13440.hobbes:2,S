If Alan wants to back-port it into 2.2.x, the lazy tlb won't work.
But yes, on 2.4.x the cost of threads is fairly low. The biggest cost by
far is probably the locking needed for the scheduler etc, and there the
best rule of thumb is probably to see whether the driver really ends up
being noticeably simpler.
The event stuff that we are discussing for pcmcia may make all of this
moot, maybe media selection is the perfect example of how to do the very
same thing. I'll forward Jeff the emails on that.
