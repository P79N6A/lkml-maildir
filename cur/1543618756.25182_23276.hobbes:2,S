Fortunately he was citing a legitimate purpose: to workaround ACPI table
bugs.  Perhaps some judges favour legitimacy while other ones favour
corruption; choose your judges wisely :-)

Except that because we can change the tables, or detect certain access
sequences, we have the possibility to _not_ hit the chipset ports to
trap into SMM mode.  It's much harder to do this with BIOS routines (but
not impossible, just harder).
Until they reduce all the AML to single port accesses which do nothing
except call SMM mode.  That takes us right back to the APM problems ;-)
