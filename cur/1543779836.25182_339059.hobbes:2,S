Cool! Definitely want this on x86-64 too.
Can we perhaps get rid of the PUSHF/POPF in the SYSENTER syscall path too?
iirc they were only for single stepping. But SYSENTER doesn't disable
single stepping, so the debug handler could detect this and set
some magic flag that restores it on syscall exit.
