Subject: Although CONFIG_IRQBALANCE is enabled IRQ's don't seem to be balanced very well

I enabled CONFIG_IRQBALANCE with 2.6.15 and 2.6.15-mm2 (which the
numbers below are from), and had expected that to evenly (or at least
close to evenly) balance IRQ's across the two CPU cores of my Athlon
X2 4400+. But as you can see below, CPU0 seems to be heavily favoured
- what's the reason for that and is it something I can improve upon?
Is it due to this being a Dual Core CPU and not two physically sepperate CPU's?
Do I need any userspace tools in addition to CONFIG_IRQBALANCE?
