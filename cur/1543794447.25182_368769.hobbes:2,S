I just had the same problem (first time ever) with 2.6.14.2.
The patched find says:
find: WARNING: Hard link count (5) is wrong for /proc/bus: this may be a bug 
in your filesystem driver.  Automatically turning on find's -noleaf option.  
Earlier results may have failed to include directories that should have been 
searched.
My /proc/bus/ contains this:
# ls -al /proc/bus/
total 0
dr-xr-xr-x    5 root root 0 Nov 18 01:45 ./
dr-xr-xr-x  199 root root 0 Nov 18 02:45 ../
dr-xr-xr-x    2 root root 0 Nov 20 15:16 input/
dr-xr-xr-x    2 root root 0 Nov 20 15:16 pccard/
dr-xr-xr-x    5 root root 0 Nov 20 10:45 pci/
drwxr-xr-x    6 root root 0 Nov 18 01:45 usb/
I checked on a few machines I have with the same kernel version, but this 
happens only on my notebook. Is there any other test I can do to help 
pinpoint the problem?
