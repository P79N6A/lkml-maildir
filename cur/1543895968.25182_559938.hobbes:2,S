Subject: [patch 0/2] HFS+: custom dentry hash and comparison operations
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/19/494

The HFS+ filesystem is case-insensitive and does automatic unicode
decomposition by default, but does not provide custom dentry
operations. This can lead to multiple dentries being cached for lookups
on a filename with varying case and/or character (de)composition.
These patches add custom dentry hash and comparison operations for
case-sensitive and/or automatically decomposing HFS+ filesystems.
Unicode decomposition and case-folding are performed as required to
ensure equivalent filenames are hashed to the same values and compare
as equal.
Tested on i386, x86_64 and PPC.

Cheers,
Duane Griffin.
