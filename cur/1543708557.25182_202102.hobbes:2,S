Well.....   we should be moving away from ioctls for this.
For addressing raid arrays, inject REQ_SPECIAL requests directly into 
the request_queue.
For addressing elements above raid array level (such as when creating 
new arrays, etc.) there should be a character device that talks to the 
host driver.
And please let's not bring that godawful SNIA API into the kernel ;-)
