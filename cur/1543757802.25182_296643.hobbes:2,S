It's disappointing that this paper appears to be available only
through subscription sources. If I'm mistaken, please post a URL. 
By comparison, papers on Reno, Vegas, Westwood, BicTCP, not to mention
just about every other contribution to the field of open Internet
protocols has been readily available on the net since the birth of FTP
servers.
