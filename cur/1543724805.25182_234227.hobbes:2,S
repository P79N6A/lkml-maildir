What I'm doing is basically to replace all might_sleep with cond_resched
and then I add might_sleep in cond_resched. I also merged all
new might_sleep in Ingo's patch (converted to cond_resched). We'll see
what happens then when I try to boot such a thing (the sti and
sched_yield already given me some troubles).
I was considering adding a cond_resched_costly but I didn't see anything
really that costly to need a CONFIG_LOW_RESCHED_OVERHEAD.
btw, cond_resched should only be defined as might_sleep with PREEMPT
enabled, otherwise it's pointless to check need_resched at almost every
spin_unlock and to do it during cond_resched too. if might_sleep doesn't
BUG it means we didn't need to check need_resched in the first place if
preempt is enabled.
cond_resched_lock is another story of course.
