I wonder why we even have things like <linux/string.h>, it's something
that's defined in libc.
Why are we implementing things in the kernel while we could use someone
elses? I'm sure they're just as good.
I saw that some of the headers in /usr/include/linux did include
<asm/xxx.h>, and define some things that are defined in libc. Why don't
they just include <asm/xxx.h> and <xxx.h> in there .c files? Or even
include <xxx.h> in <linux/xxx.h> instead.
