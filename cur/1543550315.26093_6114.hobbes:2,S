This was the sort of objection I was hoping to receive :-)
When debugging this kind of problem, you're not interested in the
non-conflicting locks, only the ones which are blocked waiting for
another lock, right?
If so, then we need that structure around anyway for doing the crappy
POSIX deadlock detection.  And I don't have a problem with exposing that
to userspace.
If you did want all locks, we could walk all inodes in core and print
out all the locks held on them :-)  That might even be more scalable than
the current approach...
