I have tried to reproduce it locally, but my gcc barfed out
in namei.c with an internal error :-(
I can explain why you see recompiles though.
asm-offsets.c has a dependency on asm-offsets.h
So in the cases where asm-offsets.c is build just before asm-offsets.h
then no recompile happens - at least not if they get same timestamp.
But in the cases where there is a command or two in betweem the two
the timestamps differ so next time you execute 'make' it will see that
asm-offsets.h is newe than asm-offsets.c and thus it will rebuild the
asm-offsets.h file.
But again this does not expalin why it sometimes goes bad, sometimes
goes well. I need some compile output for good and bad cases to dig more
into it.
There is no chance this is unrealted to the asm-offsets changes?
