Hardware flow control *is* a race, and always will be. The remote end has
a delay in signalling 'stop' there is a propogation delay and a response
delay. This is why most implementations assert stop a bit *before* they
run out.
Given the size of transfers and the internal buffering one would hope the
USB devices do their own flow control if told to properly.
