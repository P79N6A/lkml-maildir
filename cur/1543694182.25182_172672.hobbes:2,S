What Valdis said.
I have several nvidia cards in some of the machines I support.
Some pointers:
1} 2.4.20 is absolutely rock solid with the 4496 driver. If 
stability is required, I strongly suggest 2.4.20.
2} If you want to play with 2.4.22 or 2.6, then set up multiple 
kernels. That way you can switch between running stably and 
experimenting at boot time. I use GRUB. Note that you'll need to 
compile a version of the nvidia 4496 drivers for each kernel. To 
prevent different versions of the nvidia driver from being 
deleted, do # touch /lib/modules/2.X.Y-whatever/video/nvidia.o 
after compiling each version.
3} Different mobos/chipsets and nvidia GPU combinations seem to be 
more stable than others. My least stable combination of the 
machines I have access to is the nforce chipset with the builtin 
GeForce 2 graphics engine. I don't know if nvidia is responsible 
for this irony or ASUS.
The drivers and patches indicated by Valdis work. On many 
machines, you'll get "badness in pci_subsys_init in search.c" 
messages. It's my opinion that this is something that nVidia 
needs to fix. In 2.6.0-test7-bk3, APIC and ACPI seems reasonably 
solid.
