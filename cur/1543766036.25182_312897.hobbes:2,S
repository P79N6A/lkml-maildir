Hi Andi,
   What is your comment on this patch?
Here is another example bug this patch will fix.
The following piece of code will get a success mmap even if compiled
with -m32. 
   int *p;
   p = mmap((void *)(0xFFFFE000UL), 0x10000UL, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
                MAP_FIXED|MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANON, 0, 0);
I believe there are other kind of corner case bugs around mm and fs. 
e.g in mremap and munmap.
Those bugs will be fixed by this patch.
