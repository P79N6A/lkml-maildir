It cannot handle even pure FIN in this state. :-( I bring apologies,
it is my fault. Thank you.
Well, you can just add one line to tcp_input.c to repair this.
                }
                /* Fall through */
+       case TCP_LAST_ACK:
        case TCP_ESTABLISHED:
                tcp_data_queue(sk, skb);
Dave, "official" patch will follow later. I must think about
some marginal effect in TCP_CLOSE_WAIT and TCP_CLOSING, which can break
out of switch too. Duh, do specs say something about segments with seqs
above fin? I do not remember.
