	On the second thought, I should apply that advice myself.  It's true
that they start aging only after they hit the unused list, but they are born
old.  Hrm...
	OK, it kills that variant and it really looks like there's no way
around dirtying dentry first time we find it on d_lookup().  Which means
that we probably want to put that |= under if - without any ifdefs...
