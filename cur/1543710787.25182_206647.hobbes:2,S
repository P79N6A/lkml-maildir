Agreed, the scenario applies.  However, I don't see how a
global LRU would fix it in eg. the case of an AMD64 NUMA
system...
And once we fix it right for those NUMA systems, we can
use the same code to take care of balancing between zones
on normal PCs, giving us the scalability benefits of the
per-zone lists and locks.

That's probably the nicest solution.  Though you will want
to cap it at a certain high water mark (2 * pages_high?) so
you don't end up freeing all of highmem on a burst of lowmem
pressure.

How about AMD64 NUMA systems ?
What evens out the LRU pressure there in 2.4 ?
