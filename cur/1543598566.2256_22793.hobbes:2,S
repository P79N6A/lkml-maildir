Nothing in a usable state.  It needs a few days of work, but the general
design is done.  Having high resolution timers would help, but it's not
essential.  Most of the work was in tracking down all the docs for the
keyboard and ps/2 mouse ports to get an overview of what the code was
trying to coax the hardware into doing.  Armed with docs I was able to see
just why our code is completely wrong for handling things like the ps/2
mouse being removed at runtime.
