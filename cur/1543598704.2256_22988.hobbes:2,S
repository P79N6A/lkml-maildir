Subject: [PATCH] Bug in sendto() causes OOPS when using RAW sockets

Hi,
Studying the implementation of raw IPv4 sockets I found that calling
sendto() on a raw socket with a NULL socket address generates a kernel
OOPS.
I checked this on kernel 2.4.3, but I also checked the sources in CVS on
vger -- the bug is still there.
The problem is that raw_sendmsg() in net/ipv4/raw.c blindly assumes that
msg_name is valid if msg_namelen is non-zero. I found that sys_sendto()
doesn't  correctly build the msghdr structure if the socket address is
NULL.
I attached a small patch to fix this issue, a C program for testing the
problem and my OOPS log.
Best Regards,
