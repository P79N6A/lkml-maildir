Known behaviour, I investigated (and solved) the problem in 2.1.130.
The disappearance of the route is caused by ipppd, which subtly changes
the configuration of the ippp0 device. If you supply ALL the information
in your ISDN startup script, this will cease to happen. I believe it
was the absence of the netmask that caused it for me.
The relevant lines in my script are:
ifconfig $DEVICE $LOCAL_IP pointopoint $REMOTE_IP
ifconfig $DEVICE -arp -broadcast netmask 255.255.255.0
After completing the configuration, I believe you will find that your
default-route will stick around.

I really thank Microsoft(TM) for encouraging manufacturers to label their
