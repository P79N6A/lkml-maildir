Not a bad idea.

Yes, that looks feasible and nice. But I remember making this change for
some subtle reason which I cannot recollect now.

Well, in this case this is not racy. Remember, we're doing a
thaw_process(p) in CPU_DEAD where p *is* frozen for cpu hotplug. So
the where we might call a freeze_process(p) after we do a thaw_process
doesn't seem to be feasible.
But I agree, we should definitely all thaw_process within kthread_stop.

Why the check kthread_should_stop() refrigerator() ?
As vatsa mentioned, we would be doing 
task_lock(p);
freezer_exempt(p, FE_ALL); /* Doesn't exist as of now, but we can work
				it out */
thaw_process(p);
task_unlock(p);
wait_for_completion();
So we are serializing the whole thing with task_lock() right?

This needs an extra field! We're supposed to be miserly when it comes to
adding new fields to task_struct, now aren't we :-)
