     The web server crashed, this is also a 4-CPU SS-10, equipped with Ross
RTK-625 Hypersparc CPU's, 384MB of RAM, CGSIX video, no other additional
hardware. 
     This machine is running completely stock Linux 2.2.13, which is to say I
have not applied ANY patches to this kernel at all. 
     It was compiled with:
gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-redhat-linux/egcs-2.90.29/specs
gcc version egcs-2.90.29 980515 (egcs-1.0.3 release)
     After running approximately 9 hours, it crashed with the following on the
console:
spin_lock_irqsave(eeb2066c) CPU#0 stuck at f00cb048, owner PC(00000000):CPU(1)
spin_lock(f0153994) CPU#1 stuck at f002dea4, owner PC(f004a44c):CPU(0)
[...repeat same two lines....]
     Relevant addresses:
     First line:
	eeb2066c Nothing close in System.map:
00000000 A ___s_user_ptrs_per_pgd
effff000 A ___h_stack_top__btset_0xeffff000
f0000000 A ___h_page_offset__btset_0xf0000000
     Perhaps this was something on the stack?
	f00cb0048 Between the following two:
f00cb018 T rpc_clnt_sigunmask
f00cb0ac T rpc_do_call
     ... would this mean something in function rpc_clnt_sigunmask()?
     And then why is PC(00000000) all zeros?
     Second line:
	f0153994 Between the following two:
f0153908 D smp_proc_in_lock
f0153988 D boot_cpu_id
	f002dea4 Between the following two:
f002de08 T patchme_store_new_current
f002e150 T __wake_up
	f004a44c Between these two:
f004a428 T sys_writev
f004a560 T sys_pread
