The code is a minimum and puring it may be difficult. I think we need to
try to minimize it as much as possible.
The reason the UHCI driver uses inline assembly is because UHCI uses a
concurrent DMA engine and could be in a r/m/w cycle when we change some
pointers. Our changes them become overwritten by the old value which is
bad.
I think that the code can be minimized to one place and reuse that. I
wish I had better understanding of alpha and powerpc assembly. I guess
this is the time to learn :)
