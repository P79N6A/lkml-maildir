you're right if we need a make clean it's because the buildsystem is
broken. However one thing that happens all the time to me, is that I
change an header like mm.h or sched.h and ~everything needs to be
rebuilt then. And since I cannot trust the current buildsystem I need to
`make clean` first just in case somebody is getting mm.h included
implicitly and fastdep so cannot notice it has to rebuild such object
too. But in such case make clean doesn't hurt much because almost
everything needs to be rebuilt anyways. Now the only regression I can
see is that kbuild was quite slower in compiling the kernel from scrach
(so I suspect that for me after editing mm.h it would take more time
with kbuild2.5 to reach the vmlinux generation than it took with the old
buildsystem after the make clean) Is that the case, or did you improved
the performance of kbuild recently?
Said that I look forward to avoid touching those .h so it becomes
possible to do parallel developement from two hardlinked trees.  Also
the ability of compile out of the tree is very clean feature, even if
it's a secondary need for me at least.
