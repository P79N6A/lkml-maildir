What is the difference between the VIA686A kernel distribution audio driver 
and the VIA686a module provided by ALSA (which works fine)?  It seems like 
ALSA provides a fully functioning VIA686a module.  Why the duplication of 
effort/re-coding?  I suppose there is some major difference that I don't 
understand?
