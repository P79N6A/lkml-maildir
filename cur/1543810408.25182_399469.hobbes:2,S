I did provide the details, but it is obvious that you need some basic knowledge
in order to contribute useful work.
You did look different than the trolls on this list, but now it seemd that
you also start parroting the FUD from the trolls on this list.
Note that this discussion did take many hours and it may be that it is more 
efficient for me to immediately stop replying because ther is no hope that this
discussion would result in any result that is worh the effort.

Sorry, I will not fix code that is maintained by people who have mo clean and 
forseable rules for integration. This discussion has become a waste of time
and any time I spend working on Linux is definitely a waste of time as long 
as decisions are comming from the belly instead of the head.
Write down a constitution for Linux, create clean rules, start making is 
possible to have useful discussions on LKML and it may become different. 
For now, Linux is scaring off people who know what they are doing.
