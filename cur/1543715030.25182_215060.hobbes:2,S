Looks like dm_ioctl() has a free form untyped buffer at the end of the
dm_ioctl struct, which makes it rough to figure the appropriate max for
data_size, esp, those that can be a list.  It's protected by capable(),
not clear if there's a good fix, and I don't see an overflow just a way
to vmalloc() a large bit of memory.  Perhaps there's a case where one
could rename to a name larger than DM_NAME_LEN, then no longer be able to
lookup based on ->name (only ->uuid).
thanks,
