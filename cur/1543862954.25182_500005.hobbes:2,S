+Our current recommendation is to use Inferno (
http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno
)
+as the 9p server.  You can start a 9p server under Inferno by issuing the 
+following command:
+   ; styxlisten -A tcp!*!564 export '#U*'
+
+The -A specifies an unauthenticated export.  The 564 is the port # (you may
+have to choose a higher port number if running as a normal user).  The '#U*'
+specifies exporting the root of the Linux name space.  You may specify a 
+subset of the namespace by extending the path: '#U*'/tmp would just export
+/tmp.  For more information, see the Inferno manual pages covering styxlisten
+and export.

+A Linux version of the 9p server is now maintained under the npfs project

+more stable single-threaded version of the server (named spfs) available from 
+the same CVS repository.
 
 There are user and developer mailing lists available through the v9fs project
