Hi
I tried 2.4.4-ac11, plain kernel for booting custom installer, and loading an
initrd image from a secondary floppydisk, using syslinux 1.62 to boot the kernel.
These parameters were used:
ramdisk_start=0 load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ramdisk=1 ramdisk_size=12288 root=/dev/fd/0
This resulted in hanged keyboard, no response. But screenblanking obviously
worked as the screen blacked out after some time.
But the keyboard no response, not even Ctrl + Alt + Del worked.
The same kernel configuration on vanilla 2.4.4 worked fine.
So... something is terribly wrong here.
