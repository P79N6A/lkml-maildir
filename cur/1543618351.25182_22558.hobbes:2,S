I don't know if this is related to the "Athlon PSE/AGP Bug" thread since that seems to be openGL related.
I recently built an Athlon 1700+, 1GB DDR, GeForce2 MX-400 AGP system on a Soyo SY-K7V Dragon for a customer.  Slack 8 installed without a hitch but once I got the system up and running 2.4.17 the system would randomly freeze.  The freezes often happen during kernel compiles but they have also happened under no load at all.
I thought it sounded like a hardware problem but I installed W2k on it the other night and now it has been up for 2 days with no problems.
I really don't have much to offer for diagnostics but I am willing to try anything that is suggested.
The freezes seem to be fairly repeatable and happen on 8/10 kernel compiles.  I have tried compiling in init 3 and with no modules loaded but it still freezes.
Thanks for any help,
