I.e. map skb's data to userspace? Not a good idea especially with it's
tricky lifetime and unability for userspace to inform kernel when it
finished and skb can be freed (without additional syscall).
I did it with af_tlb zero-copy sniffer (but I substitute mapped pages
with physical skb->data pages), and it was not very good.

Ah, I see.
Well, I think preallocate some buffers and use that in AIO setup is a
plus, since in that case user does not care about when it is possible to
reuse the same buffer - when appropriate kevent is completed, that means
that provided buffer is no longer in use by kernel, and user can reuse
it.
