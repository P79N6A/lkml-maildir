That would be the Enlightenment Sound Daemon (esd), which is a user
space sound mixer. It's part of Gnome at this point (ftp.gnome.org), and
the original devel site would be www.enlightenment.org.
I believe that apps have to be written to take advantage of esd. 
Another option would be to look at ALSA, which is getting into late
alpha. ALSA is an OSS replacement that does mixing at the device level. 
http://alsa.jcu.cz
