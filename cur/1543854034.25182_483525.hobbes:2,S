i've released the 2.6.18-rc6-rt3 tree, which can be downloaded from the 
usual place:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
the -rt YUM repository for Fedora Core 6 can be activated via:
   cd /etc/yum.repos.d
   wget 
http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/rt.repo
   yum update kernel
lots of fixes since -rt0. The latency tracer got more modularized, now 
event tracing, function tracing and latency timing/tracing can be 
selected independently as well.
to build a 2.6.19-rc6-rt3 tree, the following patches should be applied:
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.18.tar.bz2
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.19-rc6.bz2
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/patch-2.6.19-rc6-rt3
as usual, bugreports, fixes and suggestions are welcome,
	Ingo
