As I say, it sounds dumb, but I'm sure you can make it work ;)
The main person it affects is yours truly:
bix:/usr/src/25> grep fix series | wc -l 
    162
And fixes which are 2.6.x.y material need to go mm->linux_release->linus. 
I drop them when they turn up in Linus's tree.
That works as long as I don't have non-linux_release patches which depend
upon earlier fixes.  If that happens I have to wait until linux-release
merges up.
Again, it's manageable, but complex.
