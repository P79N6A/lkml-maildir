Having said that and typically of situations in which one asks for advice,
I realised the solution of using -mrelocatable-lib and something similar
to reloc_got2. Either I am missing some documentation somewhere or I could
perhaps write this down at some point to help the next guy decipher it.
I knew what the got2 section was and why it needed to be relocated but not
how to generate it! :-) Anyway it works with gcc3 and so I am happy.
Cheers,
Jon.
