Great we agree on that... because "save whole pagecache" is the only
feature that is not possible with current uswsusp code.

Currently it depends on libc, and optionaly at liblzf. We'll probably
add libssl dependency later.
BUT NONE OF THIS MATTERS. suspend.sf.net is only one implementation,
you are welcome to do different one. If we cared about userland
dependencies, we could simply include all the libraries into
suspend.sf.net's CVS.
