First of all, I have nothing against suspend2, and I think the relevant people
should judge it fairly. I don't understand however why people in this thread 
keep implying that uswsusp doesn't work. On all three machines I tested it on, 
it worked fine.
It is true maybe that it is less feature complete, but the only major drawback
that the current uswsusp implementation has at the moment (IMHO) is that it only 
supports writing to swap.
I think one important reason why people have good experiences with suspend2, is 
because it comes with a nice hibernate script, which has a module blacklist.
This list will hide the fact that some drivers will make your system hang, and
that is independent of the suspend2 or uswsusp.
The CVS version of the hibernate script has some support for uswsusp btw.
