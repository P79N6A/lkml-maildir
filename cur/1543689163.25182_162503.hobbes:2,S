As far as I can say (as a lowly 2.6 Via user) for 2.5/2.6 the relevant
bug is :
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=845
Just tell your users to open a new bug (with system info, dmesg,
interrupts, dmidecode,  acpidmp, etc) and make it block bug #845
resolution.
(btw the first registered via acpi bug is november 2002 bug #10, it just
got an initial fix that also worked for another #845 child bug. So
crossing fingers all this will be resolved soonish)
Cheers,
