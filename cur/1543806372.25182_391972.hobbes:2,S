I'm sorry, I think I don't understand.  My weakness.  Can you please explain?
Presumably you will want access to more data than you have RAM,
because RAM is still limited to a few GB these days, whereas a typical
personal data store is a few 100s of GB.
64-bit architecture doesn't change this mismatch.  So how do you
propose to avoid swapping to/from a disk, with all the time delays and
I/O scheduling algorithms that needs?
