I haven't been crazy with most of the changes in the new standard of C++
either, actually I oppose many of them, but just because they are there
doesn't mean I'll be forced to use them either.

The abstraction is to prevent you from making a mistake or from accessing
something that cannot be allowed to be randomly changed for any reason.
Furthermore it allows one to prevent oneself from making a stupid mistake.
Besides, you would have the source so if you want to allow access that isn't
a problem.

Well C also allows you to do letal things.

The abstraction bounderies are there to help you prevent bugs from popping
up not because C++ mistrusts you as a programmer.
