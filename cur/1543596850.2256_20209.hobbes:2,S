Doug,
Would it be possible to recognize & filter the specific errors output by
SANE and cdrecord rather than removing all sg sense errors?  Or to ignore
all but certain sense codes unless SG_SET_DEBUG is set?
What I'm most concerned about is to make sure that any media problems on
fixed disks (03/11/00, etc.) don't get missed.  
Perhaps something like: 
if (CHECK_CONDITION ...) {
  if ((type == disk && (key == MEDIUM_ERROR || key == HARDWARE_ERROR))
     || (sdp->sgdebug > 0))
        print_req_sense(...)
  }
How about that?
Andy
