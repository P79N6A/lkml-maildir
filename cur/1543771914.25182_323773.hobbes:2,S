The semaphore is initialised with the limit level, so once it has been
down()ed more than `limit' times, processes will block until someone does
up().

yup.  The semaphore will prevent more than `limit' pages being allocated at
any point in time.

Oh bugger.

Perhaps the newer kernel has writeback thresholding fixes so it's not
possible to dirty as much memory with write().
You can probably trigger the same problem if the memory is instead dirtied
with mmap(MAP_SHARED).
