As Andi mentioned, it might not be a big issue since the page cache is
not scanned.

Looking at these collisions in more detail, from the above 90 only
about 40 are real collisions that introduce new aliases. The others
are container_of() usages on other members (task_struct has about 4
different aliases).

Since the linker seems to be smart enough to eliminate string
duplicates, a "const char *" can be used as a unique id (assuming that
the container_of is always called with the type name and not
"typeof").

That's an interesting approach and it would work even with "typeof()"
constructs.
Anyway, in both the incoming and outgoing pointers case, the type
information needs to be associated with the allocated memory block.
This would mean that all the kmalloc/kmem_cache_alloc etc. calls in
the kernel have to be modified to pass the type information. Would
such a (big) patch be acceptable for the kernel? The sizeof is the
only information that could get close to type identification and is
passed to these functions, though it has its risks.
Is it also worth the effort? With the large number of platforms Linux
runs on, a leak would be spotted sooner or later.
