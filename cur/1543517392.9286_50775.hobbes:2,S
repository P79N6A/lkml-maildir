the point is that we _cannot_ change this. The IOAPIC pins are often
directly connected to respective PCI-bus interrupt pins. If the card sends
an INT#D then there is no way we can ever change this. This is a physical
property. Unless every Linux distribution includes a tiny remote
controllable robot equipped with a screwdriver and a soldering iron, i
doubt the kernel could ever get around this.
