    first of all, I'm not subscribed to the list, so please CC me the answers.
    I'm being forced by my distro to use UUDIs to specify the boot device by
UUID. the problem is I don't know how to add UUID support to the kernl, that is,
I don't know which option I should enable.
    some might say «go fix your distro», some might say «change your distro».
yes, those are options, but for me is more interesting to know what part in the
kernel is responsible for this.
    so, thanks in advance for any answer.
