In page_alloc.c:__alloc_pages() the minimum is calculated for each memory
zone as (1UL << order) plus z->pages_low for each zone scanned whilst
looking for memory. Various scans are done, but z->pages_min is the key
number from which the limits are calculated.
It appears that z->pages_min is initialized in 
page_alloc.c:free_area_init_core() to the real size of the zone divided
by zone_balance_ratio[] (set to 128 by default) for that zone and clamped to 
zone_balance_max[] (set to 255 by default) and zone_balance_min[] (set to 20
by default).
It appears that the memfrac= command line option should allow tweeking
of zone_balance_ratio[] but if you've got more than approx 128M of memory it
would appear (if I've understood this correctly) that you'll have the
maximum of 255 pages for z->pages_min.
Steve.
