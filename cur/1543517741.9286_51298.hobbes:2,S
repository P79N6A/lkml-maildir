That's not a helpful response. Firstly, AFAIK, gcc 2.95.x is still
suspect (it's not had the rigorous testing that gcc 2.7.3.x has
had). Secondly, gcc 2.7.3.x is the recommended compiler in
Documentation/Changes.
Finally, "mainstream" == "middle of the road" -> roadkill :-)
Who wants to be a sheep, anyway?
