Your thinking is correct. No new features after halloween, but
obviously code *fixing* those that made it before the cut-off
will still be taken right up to 2.6.0
I have visions of pre-freeze October as everyone goes mad rushing
to get their last minute features in, and then post-freeze November
the endless.  "No really, it's just a fix!" mails.
Fun times lie ahead.
