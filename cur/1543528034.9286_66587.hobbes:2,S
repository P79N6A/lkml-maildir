Marc,
Thanks for the valuable suggestion!  However, passing parameters to the
driver will not do the work for me.  Basically what I am trying to do is to
set up persistent binding environment for Linux.  This happens to Fibre
Channel world when new device plugged into the loop or Fibric, the existing
device address could change which leads to target id changes.  The persisten
binding is to preserve all existing device target id unchanged.  This
requires to put existing target id and the coresponding device world wide
name pair somewhere in a file (or ROM), and be a refernece for the system
next boot. 
If Linux has some system calls to allow driver access from a file during the
loading process, the solution will be obvious.

No, however you can define module variables which will be passed to the
driver.
Example (for 2.2.x):
/* Module parameters */
int unacceptable_mask = 0; /* You can use this to bypass detection
                            * of the boards. E.g. setting to 4
                            * will skip the 3rd board.
                            */
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(2,2,0)
MODULE_PARM(unacceptable_mask, "i");
#endif /* >= 2.2.0 */
Use:
   insmod driver.o unacceptable_mask=1
Used in conjunction with on-demand loading (/etc/conf.modules) or with
startup scripts, you get mostly similar functionnality.
