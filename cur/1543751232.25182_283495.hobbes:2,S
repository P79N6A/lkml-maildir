You must have a wild number of requests configured in the queue.  Is this
CFQ?
I've done testing with "all of memory under writeback" before and it went
OK.  It's certainly a design objective to handle this well.  But that
testing was before we broke it.

It's misnamed.  We don't "wait for the queue to come out of congestion". 
We simply throttle until a write completes, or, rarely, timeout.
The bug which you fixed would cause the VM to scan itself to death without
throttling.  Did the fix fix things?
