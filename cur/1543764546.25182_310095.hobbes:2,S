Some times NFS is unavoidable.
In the best case (see previous email wrt to only stat'ing the parent
directories when you can) for a current kernel though you can get away
with 894 stats --- over NFS that would probably be tolerable.
After claiming such an optimization is probably not worth while I'm
now thinking for network filesystems it might be.
