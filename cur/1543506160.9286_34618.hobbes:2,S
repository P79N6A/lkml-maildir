Gee, Alan.  Now who's sleighting the contributions of other kernel
contributors, eh?
You maintained the code _at_one_point_.  There was networking code before
you started maintaining it, bucko.
Sure, you've done a lot for Linux, but not even Linus has done enough to
justifiably cop the attitude that you're spewing right now.  I suggest
you take some valium and a deep breath.
