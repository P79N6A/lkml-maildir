Brute-force merge to 2.5.70. Contains the pagetable fragmentation fixes,
but a new regression appears to have been introduced where active pages
are found on the inactive queue. Under investigation.
Unified anonymizing fault handling is on hold until this is worked out.
Once merged that should further reduce internal fragmentation of
anonymous memory and handle fragmentation on COW faults.
