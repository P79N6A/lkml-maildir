Hello, everyone, I want to make some specific .ver
archives for my module. I use the following command.
gcc -E -D__GENKSYMS__ main.c | genksyms -k 2.4.7 >
main.ver
I can create the main.ver file. But when I build my
module with this .ver file I couldn't load the module
into the kernel using the insmod command. It said that
the there are some unresolved symbols in my module. I
think it is a problem of kernel version confliction.
My linux is RedHat Linux 7.2 and the kernel version is
2.4.7-10. How can I specify this kernel function in
the genksyms command line?
Thank you very much.
