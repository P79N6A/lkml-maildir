Hi!
When I unplug pcmcia ne2k (without  stopping card, just uplug), it
oopses. In earlier kernels, it gave few error messages but more or
less worked.
I get 
invalid operand 0000
fault is in __wake_up
stack trace contains
c027... (bogus)
c0279978 (bogus)
c01a5e08 ei_receive
c0115994 process_timeout
c01ef18a cs_sleep
c01ef4fa do_shutdown
