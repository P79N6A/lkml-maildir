My system is running with an epoch_t of 50 years, it has 5 NFS mounted
file systems on 5 different machines, each running with their own value
of epoch_t.  What does stat() do on an NFS file?  What does localtime
do on the results of stat()?  What happens when I mirror files and the
master machine changes its epoch_t but my machine is using an old epoch_t?
What do I do with the timestamps for files on backup and read only media
when I change the epoch_t on a machine?
I'm not saying don't use an offset but it has a lot of side effects and
problems to be fixed first.
