I disagree. I think the current implementation changes the balancing according 
to nice much more effectively than previously where by their very nature, low 
priority tasks were balanced more frequently and ended up getting their own 
cpu. No it does not provide firm 'nice' handling that we can achieve on UP 
configurations but it is also free in throughput terms and miles better than 
without it. I would like to see your more robust (and nicer code) solution 
incorporated but I also want to see it cost us as little as possible. We 
haven't confirmed anything just yet...
Cheers,
Con
