I've been using the 2.5 series for a long time now, but I have vague
memories of not needing to use 'ide=nodma' before this patch was added:

I don't recall which kernel brought this change, and I can't swear that
this recollection is correct.
I'd received mail from another person stating that the ALi DMA is broken
from many old chips, but that it is only the UDMA stuff that is broken,
and the MW_DMA stuff works. Also the notes about the 2.6 transition
indicate ali15x3 and DMA don't always play nicely together. Still,
if the MW_DMA stuff works, some hdparm trickery like ...
# hdparm -d1 -X34 /dev/hda
... would supposedly activate working DMA. I really screwed up my
machine once by fooling around with hdparm so I'm very hesitant to go in
and start trying hdparm commands without some expert guidance.
