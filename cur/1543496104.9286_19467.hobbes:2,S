EFS is the filesystem that non-ISO9660 IRIX CDROMs are using.  It's also
being used for harddisks but has in IRIX 6.x been replaced by XFS - which
we would be way cooler to have for Linux.  The current EFS implementation
seems to be stable but is unfortunately just r/o.  Dunno if the current
maintainer of EFS, Al Smith intends to make it r/w which would be way
cooler for Linux / IRIX interoperability than FAT.
