Does anyone know what port does Windows use? I'm pretty sure that it isn't 80h 
as I run Windows 98 often with port 80h debug card inserted. The last POST 
code set by BIOS usually remains on the display and only changes when BIOS 
does something like suspend/resume. IIRC, there was a program that was able 
to display temperature from onboard sensors on the port 80h display that's 
integrated on some mainboards.
