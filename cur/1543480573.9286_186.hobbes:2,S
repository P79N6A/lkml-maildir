| Hello Friends,
| I'm puzzled by the returned data of the 'readdir' call. The dirent
| structure has a d_reclen entry. If I run a small C program under 2.0.36
| which returns the d_reclen of the root directory entries I get:
+--->8
d_reclen != d_namelen
d_reclen is the size of the directory entry.  This includes the size of the 
inode number and potentially any unused space after the entry (from removed 
entries).  It's there so directory entries can be read efficiently by 
skipping the unused entries.
You're probably looking for the d_namelen stuff that BSD directory entries 
had but POSIX did not pick up.  It's not there.  Anyone using d_reclen to 
mean the same thing is broken.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
