As expected.
Note that ->nivcsw/->nvcsw doesn't change. There is no "spare time"
on CPU 1, "vrsx" monopolizes CPU. events/1->cache_reap() was preempted
by vrsx, it had no chance to run since then. Note that jobs == 7974
doesn't change too. I forgot to print cwq->thread->state, but it should
be TASK_RUNNING. It would not be possible to kill vrsx if cache_reap()
stalled.
I don't think this is a kernel problem, vrsx breaks flush_workqueue().
Ingo can answer authoritatively, but I think SCHED_RR/SCHED_FIFO were
not designed to be 100% cpu-bound.
That said, I think it makes sense to get rid of flush_scheduled_work()
in floppy.c.
Thanks!
Oleg.
