Check the archives of this list.  A while back there was a discussion of
chroot, and many ways to get out of a chroot'ed environment were listed.
I seem to recall that the conclusion was that chroot is not meant to be,
and cannot be made into, a secure environment.  It is really just a safety
net that will catch accidental goofs, but won't stop anyone trying to get
around it.
