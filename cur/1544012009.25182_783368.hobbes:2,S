Yes, sorry, I misread the description of that patch to indicate that
you planned to include a newly-generated cookie in all fsevents.
Re-reading the patch I see that you are still only generating cookies
for renames.  But yeah, better cookie generation will help scalability
if you plan to use them more broadly in fanotify.
