Hi Ronnie,
did you receive any answer?
Do you use 10Base2 (aka cheaper net)?
I do and after upgrading to 2.4.3 (I think) I had to force the driver to
use the BNC connector though the card was configured (via the little config
program supplied by 3com) to always use the BNC connector...
This way I lost several hours to figure out why it wasn't working anymore and
to discover that I have to build it as a module instead of having it compiled
into the kernel because I couldn't make it work with kernel options - only
with driver options...
Any suggestions?
Juri
