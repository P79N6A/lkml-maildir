Alacritech says, the hardware solution would make it very easy for the
application, because _every_ application would gain, without considering
the hardware it runs on itself. These are things which CEO's like to hear
- because they think, they could save time and money during development of
the application.
I don't think that it must be a problem, that on the hardware TCP stack
doesn't run any filter or other additional functions, because machines
(often clusters) with high workloads usually run on dedicated servers with
other dedicated firewall machines in front of.
I think it would be good to support this hardware, because the user can
decide afterwards (after testing), which is the best choice for his
specific application and workload.
Kind regards,
