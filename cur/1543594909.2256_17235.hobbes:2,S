It depends on device type. Good designed ones does not raises a new
interrupt until an explicit acknowledge by I/O from [user space] driver
will be received.
Access to device's ports and IRQs from user space is subject
of system admistration policy so direct access to a dangerous devices
should not be allowed.
Lastly an IRQ kernel module can disable_irq() from interrupt handler
and enable it again only on explicit acknowledge from user.
