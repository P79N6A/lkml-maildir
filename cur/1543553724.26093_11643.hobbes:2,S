I just wrote a tool that does re-sending and address-rewriting
of the first packet from user space. If the bug is that ip_dynaddr fails
to re-send the first packet, the tool should work around this and thus
be a good diagnostic aid. (And BTW, it also works around other
`first packet lost' problems that are not handled by ip_dynaddr like
lost DNS lookup). See
