While being a small patch, 16.2-16.3 was a large change. It removed the very 
aggressive starvation avoidance of spin on wait waker/wakee in 16.2, which 
clearly helped your issue.

Pretty sure we have another spinner. A reniced -11 batch run of top -d 1 and 
vmstat during the spinning, and a kernel profile for that time will be 
helpful.
