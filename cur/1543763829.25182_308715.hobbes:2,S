Yeah, that is step 3, i mailed LKML, because maybe you would have some useful
coment, or some of you who wrote said code may have contacts or something with
the copyright holders, or some other insight. I also didn't want this to cause
a problem if i blundered in some tense relationship or whatever.
For example, the tg3 driver says : 
 * tg3.c: Broadcom Tigon3 ethernet driver.

 * Copyright (C) 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 David S. Miller (davem@redhat.com)
 * Copyright (C) 2001, 2002, 2003 Jeff Garzik (jgarzik@pobox.com)
 * Copyright (C) 2004 Sun Microsystems Inc.
 *
 * Firmware is:
 *      Copyright (C) 2000-2003 Broadcom Corporation.
There is no contact for either sun or broadcom, but i believe that Jeff or
David may know where this firmware blob may (or not) come from.
Friendly,
