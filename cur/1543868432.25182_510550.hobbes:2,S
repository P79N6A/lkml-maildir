And SuperIO precludes PNP support?  I guess that's one of the Mysteries.
Well, as I said, "non-legacy" configs.  One must start somewhere, and
I have no (working) legacy hardware to even try!

Preventing that oopsing, while letting me have a single patch to work with.

Certainly could; that's one of the comments I expected. 
But someone who knows PNP better than I do should confirm that part is
correct; I'm not sure a 24bit mask is correct for *all* PNP devices.
(And while it shouldn't hurt for devices that don't support DMA, it might
still be better not to set DMA masks for such devices...)

Yes, removal of class_device and friends from the SPI stack.  That's a
case where a "struct class" adds no value.

Good!  Did you happen to try parport printing, with DMA?

Lower would be better, if there's going to be such a warning; the issue
isn't specific to parport_pc.  This version doesn't add such a warning.

Smaller is better.  ;)

I didn't want to make that call for the I2C stack, certainly not as
part of this patch!  The goal here wasn't "fix everything"; rather
to start the fixing, by providing the API and making the most common
cases behave.

I admire your enthusiasm.  :)

Yes, a platform_driver ... and ideally, moving all that hardware probing
and scanning code into a separate file.  Probe/scan steps shouldn't really
be part of *any* driver.
There are probably good reasons (== deep hardware braindamage on older
systems that are now hard to find) for the strange init sequencing in
that code, but I can't see why they should prevent splitting out
	(a) device discovery via probing, PNP, or whatever; from
	(b) the driver itself, getting handed a device node that's
	    pre-configured with the resources reported by discovery.
Maybe the maintainers of the parport stack will have comments.  Though
the info in MAINTAINERS seems dated, if not obsolete.
