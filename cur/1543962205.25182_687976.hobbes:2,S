in general you are correct, however I don't think that it's the general 
bugs that end up delaying the releases, think it's the nasty, hard to 
identify and understand bugs that delay the releases, and I don't think 
that the debugging of those will speed up much.

Ok, I guess I don't understand what you are proposing then.
I thought that you were proposing going from 2 week merge + 6 week 
stabilize = release to 1 week merge half + 3 week stabilize = release
it now sounds as if you are saying 1 week merge + x week stabilize + 1 
week merge + x week stabilize = release
can you clarify?

if merging fewer catagoies of stuff doesn't speed up the release cycle 
then you are right, it would just slow things down. however I thought you 
were arguing that if we merged fewer catagories of stuff each cycle we 
could speed up the cycle. I'm saying that maintainers can choose to test 
this experimentally and see if it works. if it works we can shift to doing 
more of it, if it doesn't they only delay things by a couple of months one 
time.
you would need to have several maintainers decide to participate in the 
experiment or the difference in cycle time may not be noticable.
