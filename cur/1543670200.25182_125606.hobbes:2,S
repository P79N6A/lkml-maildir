Actually i just realized after checking - we are using 6.04 also (standard
- not failover). The error and abort messages in my previous were from
the 6.04 driver.
Happens on 2 different machines that do around 200 IOs/sec during the day.
We are beginning to suspect heat from a e1000 in a slot next door.
All the crashes occur when our thermostat switches to one aircon instead
of two although the ambient temp is around 25 celcius which is still
relatively cool. Sometimes after the failure, the card will fail to
re-initialise after a cold boot but works after leaving the machine
off for about 20 minutes.
