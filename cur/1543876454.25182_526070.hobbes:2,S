We must not have a great intersect of radeon and such systems..

It currently is required to be in a big 8MB chunk as it gets chopped
up by the X server not the kernel, so kernel needs to allocate pages
to back it when X inits, yes this is ugly, no it can't be fixed
without time-travelling and fixing deployed X servers...
Really we probably only need the ring buffer to be in coherent memory,
the rest of the stuff is used for DMA buffers which are mainly filled
by the CPU and read by the GPU. However I cannot change this without
breaking X, the solution is really to use TTM for this sort of
stuff.... I'm a bit worried as the AGP driver now uses vmalloc_32
which really is a meaningless interface on 64-bit systems..
Dave.
