Patch Generally looks ok.  Comments:
1) This code is weird:
>                if (copy_to_user(buffer, dmabuf->rawbuf + swptr, cnt)) {
>-                       if (!ret) ret = -EFAULT;
>-                       return ret;
>+                       if (!ret)
>+                               ret = -EFAULT;
>+                       break;
>                }
If you have an error condition (ret != 0), then you should not attempt
the copy_to_user at all.
If you do not have an error condition, you should unconditionally assign
-EFAULT to 'ret'.
There is code like this around calls to copy_{to,from}_user and
signal_pending that I see at a quick glance.
2) this patch enabled cs_mmap, and removes a check for vma->vm_offset !=
0.  Also that is clearly 2.2.x code, simply removing the check is
wrong.  You should replace the check with one that checks vma->vm_pgoff
!= 0.
3) is there method or madness to the delay changes?  they are not
explained, just changed...
4) cs_probe is marked __init but cs_remove is marked __devexit.  on
hotplug, cs_probe simply doesn't exist in the kernel anymore... boom.
5) there is no need to appear zeroes to the end of these cs_pci_tbl
entries.  Just end each with "PCI_ANY_ID,"...
+       { PCI_VENDOR_ID_CIRRUS, 0x6001, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, 0
},
+       { PCI_VENDOR_ID_CIRRUS, 0x6003, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, 0
},
+       { PCI_VENDOR_ID_CIRRUS, 0x6004, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, 0
},
6) remove check for pci_present(), redundant
7) use pci_module_init for hotplug. quite simply:
	init_module() { return pci_module_init(&my_driver); }
of course for cs46xx, you will want to keep the version printk...
8) xxx_MODULE_NAME was a dumb and overly-lengthy creation of mine.  Use
instead MODNAME.
