With some new (working) ram in the box, and root on hda; sata_sil
gave pretty consistent 29 MB/sec as an auxiliary sda disk, mounted,
remounted, unmounted, verified 29.50 +/- .40 MB/sec, consistently.
However, when I boot with root on sda, I get better performance (?), up
to 41MB/sec and consistently in the 30s; with x and many daemons (but
unloaded)...
 Timing buffered disk reads:  100 MB in  3.05 seconds =  32.74 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  112 MB in  3.04 seconds =  36.84 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  114 MB in  3.01 seconds =  37.82 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  104 MB in  3.02 seconds =  34.48 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  110 MB in  3.00 seconds =  36.64 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   94 MB in  3.01 seconds =  31.19 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   88 MB in  3.01 seconds =  29.25 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   90 MB in  3.06 seconds =  29.37 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   88 MB in  3.01 seconds =  29.23 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  108 MB in  3.03 seconds =  35.70 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  120 MB in  3.04 seconds =  39.47 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   88 MB in  3.00 seconds =  29.30 MB/sec
(more or less random intervals, at least 5 seconds apart), this
is running a bk kernel checked out June 28. I've written up to 200Gb
to this disk and built a workstation on it, no errors.
Thanks!
