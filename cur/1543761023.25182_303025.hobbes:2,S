Subject: enabling IOAPIC on C3 processor?

I have a VIA Epia M10000 board that crashes very badly (and pretty
often, especially when using DMA). I want to fix that.
Serial console + magic SysRQ didn't help so I am going the nmi
watchdog way. But in order to have nmi watchdog I need APIC, right?
The C3 processor seems to support IOAPIC.
(
http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/processors/c3/specs.jsp
)
But:
- I don't see anything in the BIOS related to APIC. 
- grep APIC /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/.config shows me that all
APIC options are 'y'.
- dmesg | grep APIC tells me "no local APIC present or hardware disabled".
- adding lapic kernel parameter doesn't change that. 
- and of course, nmi_watchdog=1 or 2 gives me NMI count 0 in /proc/interrupts.
Did I miss something when it comes to enabling IOAPIC support on C3 processor?
Note: I also see a lot an increasing ERR count in /proc/interrupts,
especially when I put my box in conditions that make it also more
unstable (i.e. sending files on the network while using the PVR-350
using mythtv). Not sure if it is related.
