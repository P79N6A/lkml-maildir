Thanks.  Is there a preferred way of getting the equivalent info
as free(1) did under 2.2?
I've written a script to derive it from /proc/[0-9]*/statm, but that seems
like an awkward approach.  A related question: is the page size stored in
/proc somewhere?
Is there a discussion of this somewhere?  I couldn't find one when I
searched the linux-kernel archives.
