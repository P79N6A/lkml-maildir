IMHO, free and open source software seem to differ on one key point:

The way I understand it, programs licensed under the GPLv3 are *not* open 
source software. FSF is so caught up in their own agenda that they're 
forgetting the whole point - the freedom of choice. The GPLv2 may 
be "conformant with this requirement", but it goes against the ethics of the 
FSF, so we can't expect each new version of the GPL to comply to this right.
Attacking this so-called "tivozation", IMO, finally draws a distinct line 
between "free" and "open source". We, as open source developers, are not 
politicians or philosophers; we write software, and we wish to publish our 
code under a certain set of ten rights.
Yes, the GPL is a legal document, but it was written in order to compliment 
the GNU Manifesto by setting legal parameters for which they could publish 
their code under.
Until now, the GPL (v2) has had the same *legal* paramaters the open source 
developers need in order to do the job we need it to do. We have clearly went 
our separate ways now, so I think it's time to drop the GPL. (See my other 
thread about writing an open source license.)
Anyways, that's my $0.02.
