   Stuart,
   Many thanks for this interesting approach.
   A huge advantage is that it can be implemented as a script.
   But:
   -it still requires the Linux newcomer who wants his modem to work, to
recompile her/his kernel - something which frightens beginners.
   -it implies that when adding a serial device such as an other modem, or
a  serial scanner, the kernel ought again to be recompiled according to
the new hardware configuration.
   -and at each kernel upgrade, often automatic in large organizations,
the kernel must again be tailored to the configuration.
                                         Thanks again - Jacques
