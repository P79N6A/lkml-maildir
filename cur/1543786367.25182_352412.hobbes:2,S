Yes, please: that sounds right.  With macros which dissolve to nothing
when it's off, to avoid #ifdef CONFIG_....s throughout the source.c.
#ifdef around the mm fields themselves?  Probably best that way.
Still need a pointer in the Kconfig to some project that uses these.
Still sceptical that hiwater_vm and hiwater_rss are the magic
missing numbers which bring system accounting into the 21st century:
more to come?
Thanks,
Hugh
