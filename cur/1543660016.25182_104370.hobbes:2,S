Subject: 2.5.59: Input subsystem initialised really late

It appears to be impossible to get a SysRQ-T dump out of a kernel which
has hung during (eg) the SCSI initialisation with 2.5.
Unlike previous 2.4 kernels, the keyboard is no longer initialised until
fairly late - after many of the other drivers have initialised.
Unfortunately, this means that it is quite difficult to debug these hangs
(we'll leave discussion about in-kernel debuggers for another time!)
Can we initialise the input subsystem earlier (eg, after pci bus
initialisation, before disks etc) so that we do have the ability to use
the SysRQ features?
