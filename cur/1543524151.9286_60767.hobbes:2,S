No, but there's a bug which prevents it from working.  Unfortunately the autofs4
patch makes the original autofs kernel module think its also v4, which confuses
things.  I'm working on a fix, but the work around is to use the autofs 4
kernel module, since the autofs 3.1.x daemon will be happy with that..
