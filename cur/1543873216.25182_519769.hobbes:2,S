Subject: [PATCH 06/18] mv kernel/cpu/cpufreq/speedstep-lib.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

OK, this one is a little different.
Move arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/speedstep-lib.h to include/asm-i386.h
This file is used by files in arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq that are not moved.
So we move it into a more global area, to keep the includes from going a bit
crazy.
Note, the moved files that include this file will have the change to
locate it. So it's not just a straight copy.
