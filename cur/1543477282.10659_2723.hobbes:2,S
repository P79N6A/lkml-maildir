I thought sarcasm was internationally understood. :( Can someone mail me
off list with some pointers how I can avoid such a misunderstanding again
(short of actually being clear. :) ).
I ment that "I've seen windows device drivers do some very unnice things,
like call .dll's and I am worried that someone not very versed in
Linux/Unix would produce some very 'wrong' drivers".

They obviously dont care about other arches, we'll be luckey with just
x86. AFIK their product wont even work under Alpha/NT.
