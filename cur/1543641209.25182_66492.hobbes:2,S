You pointed your finger on this exact common problem.
You can use the XOR bonding mode (modprobe bonding mode=2), which uses a
hash of mac addresses to select the outgoing interface. This is interesting
if you have lots of L2 hosts on the same network switch.
Or if you have a few hosts on the same switch, you'd better use the "nexthop"
parameter of "ip route". IIRC, it should be something like :
  ip route add <destination> nexthop dev eth0 nexthop dev eth1
but read the help, I'm not certain.
Cheers,
Willy
