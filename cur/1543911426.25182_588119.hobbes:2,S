That's true -- but bear in mind that most SPI members are inactive, and
don't even vote for SPI leader.  I doubt most existing members could be
bothered to vote for Linux Foundation TAB.

It's hard to join KS.  And it doesn't just 'favour' kernel developers,
it completely limits it to kernel developers.

I think that's a statement of the current position, and not necessarily
where the TAB wants to be.
