Hmmm...
Needed me hours to apply the patches, don't know why, ---
No more bad clicks, no more keypress events --- but still loosing sync 2*n
times at once, most of the times when changing the console, mostly at the
1st byte, the first of the two times occasionally at the 4th...
...New error message: bad data from KBC - timeout every about third sync
loss.
Strange thing is: The sync losses mostly occour half a second after i have
finished using the touchpad, and occasionally when I don't use it at all...
And they occour nearly everytime I switch consoles. (Not using framebuffer,
X or something like this.)
Changing the data rate from the touchpad changes nothing.
Looked at all kernel options... If it is a timer problem --- ho can I find
out this?
Yours,
	Gunter.

The difference between common-sense and paranoia is that common-sense is
thinking everyone is out to get you.  That's normal -- they are.  Paranoia
is thinking that they're conspiring.
