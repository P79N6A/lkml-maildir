Hi,
the kernel already has a full DMI decoder, this module appears to just
try to duplicate it (at least judging on the snippet you pasted). It'd
be a lot better if the module would just use the existing DMI layer...
If it did that then it doesn't need isa_memcpy_fromio() *at all*...
see the drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c file for the linux DMI layer code.
