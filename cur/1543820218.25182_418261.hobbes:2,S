Yes, it's more or less s390 specific.
What happens is the following: synchronize_rcu() enqueues an RCU callback on
cpu 0. Later on cpu 0 handles a bunch of RCU batches, but without handling
this specific request (it's in rdp->curlist). Since this cpu has nothing else
to do it enters cpu_idle() (it's a nohz idle, therefore it might be quite a
long time in idle state).
While cpu 0 is in idle state cpu 2 calls cpu_quiet() which in turn will call
rcu_start_batch(). If cpu 0 would run now, it would notice rdp->curlist moved
to rdp->donelist and that there is something to do. Unfortunately it doesn't
get notified from rcu_start_batch(). That's why I ended up waiting several
seconds until finally some interrupt arrived at cpu 0 which made things go
on finally.
Avoiding this could be done if we look at rdp->curlist before going into
a nohz idle wait, or we could send an interprocessor interrupt to idle
cpus. Sending an interrupt while looking only on nohz_cpu_mask seems to
be a bit racy, since other cpus might have entered cpu idle after
nohz_cpu_mask has been read...
At least the initcall change for inet_init() can go in, since it just
revealed a problem that we have anyway.
