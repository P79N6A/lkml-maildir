I'd like to thank Grant for pointing out to me that this is exactly what
the write immediately above this is doing -- enabling device 8 to
respond to config space cycles.

Here's the patch to implement the above two suggestions:

Subject: [PATCH] Use proper abstractions in quirk_intel_irqbalance
Since we may not have a pci_dev for the device we need to access, we can't
use pci_read_config_word.  But raw_pci_read is an internal implementation
detail; it's better to use the architected pci_bus_read_config_word
interface.  Using PCI_DEVFN instead of a mysterious constant helps
reassure everyone that we really do intend to access device 8.
