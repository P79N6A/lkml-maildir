This is the intro from the first set of patches I sent (I adjusted it
for the additional syscalls):
====
Here is a series of patches which introduce in total 13 new system calls
which take a file descriptor/filename pair instead of a single file
name.  These functions, openat etc, have been discussed on numerous
occasions.  They are needed to implement race-free filesystem traversal,
they are necessary to implement a virtual per-thread current working
directory (think multi-threaded backup software), etc.
We have in glibc today implementations of the interfaces which use the
/proc/self/fd magic.  But this code is rather expensive.  Here are some
results (similar to what Jim Meyering posted before).
The test creates a deep directory hierarchy on a tmpfs filesystem.  Then
rm -fr is used to remove all directories.  Without syscall support I get
this:
real    0m31.921s
user    0m0.688s
sys     0m31.234s
With syscall support the results are much better:
real    0m20.699s
user    0m0.536s
sys     0m20.149s

I'm not sure how you want to handle this.  I don't particularly want to
resent all of them just for this purpose.
