I was not aware of the zisofs patch... I will be looking at it
in these days, and try to compare it to the isocompr patch (that
was also brought to our attention by people on the list quite a long
time ago, but we only ended up fixing it recently :-)).
I will keep you posted on the results (this does not prevent others
from doing the comparison, of course, but I promise to post a result
soon)
