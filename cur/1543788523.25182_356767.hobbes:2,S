I don't want to confuse Andrew, the patch is definitely correct and
needed...
It is more about "cold plug" case, when processors are not present
initially, but physically added to the systen during runtime. The
problem was not to preserve, but not to even allocate per_cpu for all
NR_CPUS, only for physically present processors. Then create per_cpu
with all the allocated data for the newly added processors. But as I
said it is probably too much to ask after all... :)
Thanks,
