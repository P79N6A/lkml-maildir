From this, I infer that you think that the option to "omit" the msglevel arg --
e.g.,
	netdev_err(dev,, "NIC is fried!\n");	/* always logged */
-- is silly.  No big deal.  Its sole purpose is to help keep netdev_* calls terse.

But how do you code a netdev_* call where you ALWAYS want the message (including
netdev_printk-style prefix) logged, regardless of the value of msg_enable?  That's
what NETIF_MSG_ALL is for (and why it might be better called NETIF_MSG_ALWAYS)...
	netdev_err(dev, ALL, "NIC is fried!\n");	/* always logged */
or
	netdev_err(dev, ALWAYS, "NIC is fried!\n");	/* always logged */

Sorry, I'm not sure what you're getting at here.  netdev_* doesn't prevent
people from using the existing netif_msg_* macros; it just provides shorthand
for the (usual) case where "do something" is "printk".
