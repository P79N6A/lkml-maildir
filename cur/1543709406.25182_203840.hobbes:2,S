I have been talking with the gdb folks and I think we are real close to having a 
solution that makes very minimal (if any) changes to gdb.  At this point we can 
write a couple of macros that do almost all that we need.  The only problem 
seems to be the number of lines per thread in the report.  So, the only change 
to gdb would be to suppress a carrage return in a couple of places.
It does require that we implement a new command in the stub, or rather, that we 
change the ThreadExtraInfo command to do the same thing with a different command.
I will keep you posted, or better yet, sign up for the gdb@sources.redhat.com 
mailing list and listen in.
