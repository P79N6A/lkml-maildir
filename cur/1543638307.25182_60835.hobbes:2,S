Normal DOS partition, with 512 byte block size, as this is 512B block
device, at least I believed to it until now. As start=63, it apparently
also handles 1024B requests on odd address (I believe that sfdisk -d dumps
start 0-based).
# partition table of /dev/hdc
unit: sectors
/dev/hdc1 : start=       63, size=12685617, Id=83, bootable
/dev/hdc2 : start=        0, size=       0, Id= 0
/dev/hdc3 : start=        0, size=       0, Id= 0
/dev/hdc4 : start=        0, size=       0, Id= 0
