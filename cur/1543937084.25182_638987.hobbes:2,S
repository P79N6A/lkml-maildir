hm, Neil said
  The first fixes a bug which could make it a candidate for 24-final. 
  However it is a deadlock that seems to occur very rarely, and has been in
  mainline since 2.6.22.  So letting it into one more release shouldn't be
  a big problem.  While the fix is fairly simple, it could have some
  unexpected consequences, so I'd rather go for the next cycle.
