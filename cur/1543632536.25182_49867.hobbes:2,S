Hi,
first of all, I don't know C and I am no expert, so please apologize if 
some of
my questions/comments are stupid.
I have a yamaha based sound card which works with the opl3sa2 driver. 
However,
the isapnp activation of this card fails (this has been broken ever 
since the 2.4 series).
So I did some investigations and eventually found out that the reason is 
the following
check from isapnp_check_dma(..) in isapnp.c:
-------------
    /* Some machines allow DMA 0, but others don't. In fact on some
       boxes DMA 0 is the memory refresh. Play safe */
    if (dma < 1 || dma == 4 || dma > 7)
        return 1;
--------------
However, the opl3sa2 card insists on dma=0,dma2=1. In particular, if I 
change
"(dma < 1 || dma == 4 || dma > 7)" to "(dma < 0 || dma == 4 || dma > 7)" 
everything
works fine.
Now I am wondering what should be done:
1) Make the above change to isapnp.c. According to the above comment 
this will break
some other boxes, so probably this should be configurable via /proc/isapnp.
2) Change opl3sa2.c and force isapnp to use dma=0 (a patch can be found 
at the end of this
message).
What do the experts think is the right way to fix this problem?
A few further remarks concerning my patch:
*) The patch also adds a line "opl3sa2_state[card].activated = 1" which 
is an
obvious omission in the original driver.
*) I have to force the driver to use both dma=0 and dma2=1. From what I
understand dma=0 should be sufficient, but this will not work. Looks like
a bug in isapnp.c to me. However, this should do no harm since according
to /proc/isapnp, the card only offers these values anyway.
Thanks for your comments,
Gerald
