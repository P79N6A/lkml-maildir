This will require the following:
1. a generic text mode framebuffer driver, ie, an fbdev version of vgacon
2. a chipset driver that can fully restore VGA text mode.
The framebuffer layer already has helper functions that will save and restore
the standard VGA registers. It's the save/restore of extended registers that
only the chipset driver know about which is lacking.
 
Once the above 2 are satisfied, the infrastructure is already present that
will do what you want.
