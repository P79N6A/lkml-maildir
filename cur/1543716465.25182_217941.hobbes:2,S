There were some ATAPI device detection problems in some of the earlier
Windows nForce IDE drivers that would cause lockups during boot for some
people depending on what type of devices were attached.  
There's never been any reports of Windows hangs that have been root
caused to C1 disconnects that I'm aware of.
