Actually, yesterday I was too tired to post a followup, but I'll surely 
do this now, since at 7am I think I was able to finally find a solution.
As a last step of my playaround, I took 2.6.14-rc5 and decided to give 
it a go. To my amazement - the box booted up WITH apic, the test raid 
resync went smoothly, and the box lives till this moment! :)
Happy-happy joy-joy. In the notable differences I saw libata going from 
0.10 to 0.12, and sata_nv from 0.6 to 0.9 (actually 0.8 was the version, 
I guess Jeff forgot to bump the version, since comment says "0.9 Fixed 
the bug introduced with MCPxx support", but version defined is still 0.8).
Oh man, I can't believe I'm through with this.
Thanks everyone very very much for bearing with me all this time.
I suppose Bugzilla entry won't be necessary anymore? Or do you still 
want that for statistical purposes?
Regards,
Vladimir
