Agree.
That will also resolve the problem we discussed yesterday. 
I want to unregister my mmu_notifier when a GRU segment is
unmapped. This would not necessarily be at task termination.
However, the mmap_sem is already held for write by the core
VM at the point I would call the unregister function.
Currently, there is no __mmu_notifier_unregister() defined.
Moving to a different lock solves the problem.
