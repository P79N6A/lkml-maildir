Hello,
Disabling sd_resume() gives me a "quick" resume again (few seconds),
though it doesn't get rid of the COMRESET errors:

Doesn't the controller generate an interrupt when it detects a harddisk?
Is it really needed to do polling?
Idea: What about implementing a sata_sil specific .check_status function,
instead of using the generic ata_check_status()? That one could check other
registers to find out what's really going on in the case ENODEV is returned
by ata_check_status(), or something like that.
Greetings,
Indan
