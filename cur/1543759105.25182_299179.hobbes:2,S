The proper fix is to get the cpu_has_feature patch merged up from -mm,
but that's 99% cleanup and 1% bugfix. So here's a more appropriate fix
for the 2.6.11 patch stream. This goes on top of the one that just got
merged there.

Here's a patch that will work for both PPC and PPC64. The proper way to
fix this in mainline is to merge -mm's cpu_has_feature patch, but for
the stable 2.6.11-series, this much less intrusive (i.e. just the pure
bugfix, not the cleanup part).
