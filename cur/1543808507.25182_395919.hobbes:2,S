The Single Unix Spec appears to have a very different interpretation.
See 
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/toc.htm
        When MS_ASYNC is specified, msync() shall return immediately
        once all the write operations are initiated or queued for
        servicing; when MS_SYNC is specified, msync() shall not return
        until all write operations are completed as defined for
        synchronized I/O data integrity completion. Either MS_ASYNC or
        MS_SYNC is specified, but not both.
        When MS_INVALIDATE is specified, msync() shall invalidate all
        cached copies of mapped data that are inconsistent with the
        permanent storage locations such that subsequent references
        shall obtain data that was consistent with the permanent storage
        locations sometime between the call to msync() and the first
        subsequent memory reference to the data.
        If msync() causes any write to a file, the file's st_ctime and
        st_mtime fields shall be marked for update.
Cheers,
  Trond
