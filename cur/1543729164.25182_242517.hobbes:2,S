This is unusual.
MIS is a hardware workaround and should normally be 0.

Yes, ignore it.
This is where that message about 255 came from.
When ACPI failed to find a PCI-routing-table entry
for this device, it looked in PCI config space
and found the 255 you see above.  The only recent
change is that it dosn't try to use an obviously
bogus value.  But in either case, with this device
it is moot as the hardware and the driver are hard-coded.
