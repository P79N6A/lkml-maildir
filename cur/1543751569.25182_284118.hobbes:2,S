I don't think that's quite true.  One repeated recommendation was to
simply generalize the idea so that it applies to all capabilities.
Another, which at this point appears quite workable, was Arjan's
recommendation to make scheduling policy/priority protected by an rlimit
(complicated only by representing the combinations sanely in a single
number).
