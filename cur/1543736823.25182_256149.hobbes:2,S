I wrote it for printk()s and ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT() to log.

The reason why the acpi_walk_namespace() is used here was to
find a container object which is identical to a NUMA node.  My code
was assuming that a container having CPU and/or memory was
NUMA node sinece the current Linux seemed to assume so.

Sorry, that's a stuff that I forgot to remove.  I will remove it.
