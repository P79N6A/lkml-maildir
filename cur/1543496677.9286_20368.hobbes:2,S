Yes, sorry the tcp_packets_in_flight thing was a brain fart.
I still don't like your send queue check.

Erm no, that it required (ack a OOO packet immediately), quick ack is a
heuristic to get the sender quickly out of slow start by not delaying acks.
It would be trivial to extend it to more than one packet after slow start
begin.

With extended quick ack the ACK is not delayed for N (N is a sysctl; according
to David Borman 8 is a good N) packets after slow start.  So it would behave
the same as your in this situation.

Not wrong, but I don't think it is the best way to fix the issue. Currently
the ack send decision check in Linux 2.2 has been grown to be very complex.
This is a bad thing. Your patch makes it much more complex.
Quick ack mode is a existing mechanism that could be extended to fix it 
better.
For an overview of current working IETF papers on TCP see
http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/tcpimpl-charter.html,
 for acks see
RFC2581. The problems we have are quite clearly explained in 4.2 there,
they suggest simply to force an ACK after every two segments. I don't like
that, I would prefer to first try to fix it with quick ack mode.
The problem in Linux is clearly there, the question is only what the best
fix is.
