I'm interested too...  2.2.10 is all that we are using.  We have two
large file servers, using a raid0 (software) partition made up of 4
4.3 gig scsi drives, but we have been running this for a long while
and have seen no problems of any kind, using knfsd and the whole 9
yards...
I did turn off a couple of the "PARANOIA" switches in the nfs source
to reduce the size of our /var/log/messages file, but we haven't seen
a thing.
My quad xeon had 5 9.2 gig ultra-2 scsi drives and gets beat to death
all the time with lots of file I/O, 400% cpu busy, etc..  and I haven't
had any file corruption at all...
