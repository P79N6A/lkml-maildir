Thanks for the info and suggestions ;)
I trust Linus enough to compile a kernel as root... but maybe that's just me ;)
(or maybe I trust that I can fix anything that can fsck up my system
even with root perms ;))
I agree compiling the kernel as a non-root user is perfered but
sometimes it doesn't happen that way...
