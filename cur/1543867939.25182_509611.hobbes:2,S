Hardening a system should include deeper layers, too.

Off cause there are other ways to expose the kernel, but they can be plugged,
too, one by one. You wouldn't leave your door open just because your window
is open, while leaving the window open because the door is open.

You may verify in userspace, but you can't use the result.
OTOH, having 1000 lines of code to verify a module _is_ bloat for this task.
Remove a 0 and it should be plenty (not counting the help text).

It offers security against a class of attacks.

It provides an extra layer of security: If an exploit allows execution of
insmod(userstring), it can't compromise kernel internals.

How large is the userbase _not_ using a distribution? And are they unable to
unselect [X] Signes modules support?

That would work if there was no need for modules. Unfortunately some people
are doomed with external modules, or not experienced enough to customize
their system. Those could benefit from a sysctl(?) saying "unsigned_modules
= taint|disallow".
