Correct.  The quirk itself is a fragile hack.

It does, since it prevents one of the ports from being bound by the 
legacy IDE driver.  But the whole thing is rather hackish to begin with, 
and I prefer this hack to the existing code (in fact, Andrew already 
queued up a patch from me in -mm that looks just like yours).
Ultimately, when libata gets ATAPI support, I think we just have to 
declare libata and legacy IDE to be incompatible for combined mode 
devices and remove the quirk.  Then whichever driver loads first will 
get the whole device, as it should.
