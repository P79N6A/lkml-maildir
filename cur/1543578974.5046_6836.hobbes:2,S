Hi,
I'm new to device driver development under linux and I've a basic question
concerning modules, insmod and multiple object files.
Assume I have two object files "main.o" and "hwaccess.o". 
main.o contains the functions init_module(), cleanup_module() and some other
functions.
hwaccess.o contains some routines to access the hardware. The functions in
main.o depend on the routines existing in hwaccess.o.
main.o was created using language "C": gcc -c main.c -o main.o
and 
hwaccess.o was created using assembler: nasm -f elf hwaccess.asm -o
hwaccess.o
Is there a possibility to combine these two object files, so that I have a
module which is loadable by insmod?
Thanks in advance
Achim
