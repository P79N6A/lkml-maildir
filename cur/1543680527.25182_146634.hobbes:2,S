Subject: PATCH: seq_file interface to provide large data chunks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

seq_file interface, as it exist in last official kernel, never provides 
more then one page for each 'read' call. Old read_proc_t did loop to 
fill more than one page.
Following patch against 2.4.21 fixes seq_file to provide more than one 
page if user requests it.
Many programs do read(large_buffer) once, instead of looping while 
read()>0. They work wrong with seq_file. Also, one may expect read() to 
provide whole information atomically (OK, relatively to other process 
context stuff).
This patch loops over while some space remains in user provided buffer.
I am not subscribed to lkml, thus please cc: me (Vladimir Kondratiev
