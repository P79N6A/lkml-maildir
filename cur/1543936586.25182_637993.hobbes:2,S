Of course we should never die.  That's precisely what I'm trying to work
towards here.
Currently without this patch, various platforms I have here do precisely
that - you ask them to suspend and they shut down the majority of devices
and then die.  The recovery is either system reboot or a power cycle -
especially when the port in question is connected to something other than
an external serial port (eg, a serial port for connection to a non-existent
bluetooth module.)
While we're talking about robustness, since the serial wakeup support has
gone in, another couple of issues have appeared:
1. We no longer suspend ports marked as wakeup sources.  That means we
   never place them into a low power state (which might be required by
   hardware) - we need a flag from the driver or something to indicate
   that.
2. As a direct consequence, we no longer re-initialise the port at resume
   time, resulting in a completely deconfigured but open port.  Such a
   port may be the system console, which will cause any printks may be
   damned slow and the output will be garbage.
(2) is quite a serious problem for ARM platforms - you lose the console
entirely and you also lose control of the system.  Again, recovery from
such events is by either a power cycle or system reboot.
