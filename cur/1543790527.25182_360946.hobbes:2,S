Right, but even after remount seemingly succeeds, an attempt to write to 
  an unwritable media should return an error nevertheless, as the 
corresponding syscall should fail, obviously. And it indeed happens for 
e.g. CDROM or an NFS volume (if you repeat all the steps from my 
original post, "touch" will return an error). Yet for floppy, it 
doesn't. I suspect that a "readonly-ness" is defined at a different 
level for floppy (e.g. status of the device itself, not media). This is 
just a wild guess.
