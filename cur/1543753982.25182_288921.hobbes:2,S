I haven't tested the code, but basically, it's a good step into the
right direction. The DECstations aren't yet really in the 2.6.x world,
but that doesn't degrade your good work :-)  Also, it now seems easier
to me to integrate a different TC bus driver: this will be needed for
Linux' port to VAX computers, which may have TC busses, too.
