The following compile error comes from Linus' tree:
<--  snip  -->
...
  LD      drivers/built-in.o
drivers/pcmcia/built-in.o(.bss+0xf20): multiple definition of `pc_debug'
drivers/net/built-in.o(.data+0x24ae0): first defined here
make[1]: *** [drivers/built-in.o] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
The pc_debug in drivers/pcmcia/ds.c was made non-static in Linus' tree,
but the global definition of a global variable with such a generic name 
in drivers/net/wireless/prism54/islpci_mgt.c seems to be equally wrong.
