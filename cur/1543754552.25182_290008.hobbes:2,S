Ok, I do not insist.

It is not general rule - network stack does not have such mechanism,
which is 
very good, I doubt each block device module increment it's module
reference
when it catch a request...
It is internal structure that has reference counter, not module itself,
and this 
structure may be in use, when module is unloaded, thus unloading must
wait, 
untill all it's structures are freed.
