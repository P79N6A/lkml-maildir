This happened on my S3 Virge video card on a K6 machine.  I stuck a
Matrox Millennium II card in, and all was fine.  (This is just with a
plain VGA console, no framebuffer or anything).  It was annoying, because
it would corrupt text characters and made copying code with GPM rather
difficult.  It wasn't every time, though, and it wouldn't ever get as bad
as making it unreadable.  Often, it would take a string of 4 or 8
characters from one part of the screen and stick it in another.  It was
quite interesting. :)
I'm not sure what the actual problem is, but it seemed like some sort of
memory/bus timing problem... It happened more frequently if I used
SVGATextMode to up the refresh rate.
