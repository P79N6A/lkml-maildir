We rely upon people (such as mgross@linux.intel.com!) to send bug reports.

The alps driver is always broken.  Seems to be a feature.
Please test 2.6.13-rc3 and if it also fails send a comprehensive bug report
to Dmitry Torokhov <dtor_core@ameritech.net> and Vojtech Pavlik
<vojtech@suse.cz>

swsusp also is a problematic feature.  You appear to have chosen two of the
very most problematic parts of the kernel (you missed ACPI) and then
generalised them to the whole.  That isn't valid.
Please test 2.6.13-rc3 and if it also fails send a comprehensive bug report
to Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>
