no. The fix is always to undo the damage ASAP, to keep the window of 
breakage minimized.
Adrian, could you please check whether latest x86.git:
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git
resolves the Sparc build failure you were seeing? All known issues are 
fixed in it. (let me know if you know about more)
