This could mean that the system is trying to access one drive harder, and
not letting the other respond to requests.  This is even more reason to test
the drive...  While you're at it, test both drives.

read-only badblocks will tell you if you have a drive with sectors that are
unreadable.  read-write badblocks will tell you if there are any sectors
that are unwritable.  Be careful, older versions of badblocks will erase all
of your data.  Newer versions have a mode to preserve the data, and still do
a write test, while still keeping the other write mode.  Read the manual page.

Badblocks doesn't care what is on the drive, it just deals with block
devices, that means hard drives, floppy, etc.
I don't know if the new block device in page cache in 2.4.10+ will affect
this, but it looks plausible.  To be sure, use a -ac kernel or 2.4.9 or
older...
