The author of that patch had explained that he was unable to test it.  The patch
was merged into the v4l-dvb master development repository over the weekend, and
Mauro sent a pull request for this patch to go to 2.6.19 a few hours ago.  I 
don't know why this was sent to the 2.6.19 tree without first being tested. :-(
Mauro -- that patch needs fixing / more testing before it goes to mainstream...
Could you please remove that changeset from your git tree before Linus pulls it?
The problem changeset:
git commit 450efcfd2e1d941e302a8c89322fbfcef237be98
