All the threads already synchronize with coredump_wait in __exit_mm.  A
thread reaching that point already has control of the CPU that might be
holding its FPU state.  It seems to me it would be simplest and most
efficient to just do any necessary copy-in there, before
`complete(mm->core_startup_done)'.
