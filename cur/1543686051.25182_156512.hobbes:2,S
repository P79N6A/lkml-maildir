No, regparm(0) means "zero parameters in registers", so everything is to
be found on the stack.
Also, the notion of functions as compiler barriers has nothing to do
with arguments. It has to do with global variables and pointers from
who-knows-where.
All functions are compile barriers, regardless of regparm() magic or the
number of parameters, with the exception of functions with the gcc
'pure' keyword.
Also, sleep_on() is deprecated and bad. Thanks for trolling today.
