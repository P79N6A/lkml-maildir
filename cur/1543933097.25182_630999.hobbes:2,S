The size isn't my favorite thing.  But given how much of a mess sysctl_check.c
has allowed me to clean up and get a handle on I'm not inclined to do
anything that would compromise the checking.
Probably the sanest way to remove table entries is to individually remove and
deprecate parts of the binary sys_sysctl interface so that we don't need the
table entries.
Maybe we could through in a few #ifdefs and #defines so we can reduce
the set of allowed sysctl entries even more base on config options.
I'm not volunteering to do more then is absolutely necessary to keep
sys_sysctl working and correct until we reach a point where everyone
can agree that users of the interface truly have had fair warning and
then I intend to delete all of the code that deals with the binary
sysctl interface.
