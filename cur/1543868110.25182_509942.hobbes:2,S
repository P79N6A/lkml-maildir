I opened a bug report (228979) on bugzilla.redhat.com on this one because
I have the same issue under FC6 2.6.19-1.2895. Here is the link:
    
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=228979
Do you have any more updates on this problem? Is there a way I can help
by providing debug data?
Thanks,
Marcus
