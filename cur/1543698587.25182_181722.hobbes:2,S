I'm messing around on one of my dev machines which has 4 possible
kernels installed.  2.4, 2.4-stable, 2.6, 2.6-stable (stable is the last
known good kernel).  I currently have my System.map files laid out as:
/boot/System.map-2.6.0-test11-bk2
/boot/System.map-2.6.0-test10-bk4
etc.
Would it be possible, necessary, sane to have a lilo.conf similar to
this:
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4
	label=current
	map=System.map-2.4
	read-only
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.stable
	label=stable
	map=System.map-2.4.stable
	read-only
	optional
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.6
	label=2.6
	map=System.map-2.6
	read-only
	optional
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.stable
	label=2.6-stable
	map=System.map-2.6.stable
	read-only
	optional
This way when I install a new kernel I can copy the System.map to
/boot/System.map-2.6 instead of keeping up with all the version numbers?
lilo doesn't seem to like the map= arguements.  Does the kernel need the
System.map in a single place, can it figure out where it's at for a
multiple config?
