I believe this is a misconception.
Udev uses standard rules by default.  If the end-user (or their distro) 
wants to add additional rules or override these rules, they can do that.

Don't you have to explicitly mount /dev as type devfs?  How is this 
different than mounting it as tmpfs?

Udev gives consistant names unless you explicitly override it.

So does udev.
The real gain with devfs is that you don't need to have any userspace 
intervention to get /dev/ populated with a baseline set of device nodes. 
  As long as the udev code is sufficiently robust and compact, I don't 
have a problem with needing a userspace daemon.  Anyone that *really* 
cares about compactness (embedded people, for instance) is going to use 
a static /dev tree pruned down to the bare minimum.  For everyone else, 
the overhead of having udev running should be unnoticeable.
