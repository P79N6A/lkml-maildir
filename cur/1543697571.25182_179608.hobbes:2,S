I'm guessing the scheduling changes are the cause?
Try messing with sched_setscheduler (like:
http://awgn.antifork.org/codes/brute.c
)
Anyone else notice that the packet buffer messes up if
packets are being received while it's being created.
I worked around it here by bringing the interfaces
up AFTER the buffer is created.
