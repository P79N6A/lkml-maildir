We already have vgacon, promcon, sticon, mgacon, newportcon. What
platforms (other than embedded) are not covered by these?
The idea is to use one of these as a temporary console and not print
anything on it except KERN_ERR level messages. Of course if you are a
kernel developer you can change this. A working system would non have
KERN_ERR messages during this phase and the screen would remain blank.
Messages at levels other than KERN_ERR would be queued until
populate_rootfs()/early user space time where they would then get
displayed on the fbcon. fbcon will be a full console with mode setting
capability and other fancy features. It would immediately go into
graphics mode.
