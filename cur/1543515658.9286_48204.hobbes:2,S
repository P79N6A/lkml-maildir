I spent some time last night and merged some code that was sent to me.  This
should make the Rage128 framebuffer driver quite a bit more stable.
I'd like to thank Jeff Garzik and Ani Joshi for the code cleanup and fixes.
I should have a feature/accel patch out this weekend.
Attached is a diff against 2.3.26 (it should work against 2.3.2x).  I'd like
to get feedback from a few people before I send it to get merged with the
tree.
Thanks,
Brad Douglas
