I seriously doubt the same is true for the IO requests (which are 
different anyway, and tend to happen at a much lower frequency than 
high-speed networking).
I also suspect that your timings were very hardware-dependent in the first 
place (and yes, the long-term effect is likely working against that 
"optimization"), and depend a lot on just how sparse the initialization 
can to be.
