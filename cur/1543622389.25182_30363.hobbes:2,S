I have to agree with much of what Hans has written here.
and one of the biggest things that would help in this regard, IMHO,
is to (dare I say "require") provide documentation for kernel
API changes or semantics.  "Read the source" or "Use the source"
doesn't scale well either, when 10K kernel developers are
trying to use a new widget in 2.5.4, but they all ask questions
on lkml about how it's done.
Let's keep Documentation/* stuff up to date.  Whether it's in
text or DocBook format doesn't matter much.
Or have web pages for it if that's preferred by the project or
individual(s).
