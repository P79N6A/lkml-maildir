Maybe it would be worthwhile to set a linux-testing list?  I'm not sure
how to go about getting this set up.  Perhaps RedHat could sponsor it or
it could be added to the lists hosted at Rutgers.  Thoughts? 
Suggestions?
I am thinking it would be helpful to have a place to discuss 
Linux testing systems, projects, methodology, and so on.  
I could put up a website.  It would take a while for me to 
research how it would all work and get the thing running, 
but I have do web development experience and I have a lot 
of good contacts at Amazon.com.  I envision starting out 
small, where folks could submit project white papers 
outlining the systems they'd like to create or have created 
for them.  Then, as development moves forward, releases
would be posted.  Documentation would be there, too.
For development kernel testing, there would be pointers 
to gdb references and info on setting up a machine for 
kernel debugging.
Anyhow, it's a thought (albeit, sketchy).
I don't want to clutter up the linux-kernel list with a more 
of off-topic messages (sorry for the current deluge).
