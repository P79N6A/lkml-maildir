Yes, he's wrong about that.  In the normal case, the CONFIG_PARAVIRT 
case will continue to use the ticket-lock algorithm.

Probably nothing.  Xen has its own optimised spinlock implementation, 
and so doesn't use the plain byte locks.  But ticket locks are awesomely 
bad for any virtual environment which doesn't gang schedule VCPUs, so 
the kvm folks would do well to at least consider using them.
