Hi Randy,
The format seems to have changed rather a lot since that was written.  All I 
get is:
Aug 17 11:25:13 codewave kernel: MCE: The hardware reports a non fatal, 
correctable incident occurred on CPU 0.
Aug 17 11:25:13 codewave kernel: Bank 0: dc0000000000050b
...but what parsemce seems to be expecting is:
 Sample kernel output..
 Sep  4 21:43:41 hamlet kernel: CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: 
0000000000000004
Sep  4 21:43:41 hamlet kernel: Bank 1: f600200000000152 at 7600200000000152
Sep  4 21:43:41 hamlet kernel: Bank 2: d40040000000017a at 540040000000017a
Sep  4 21:43:41 hamlet kernel: Kernel panic: CPU context corrupt
As a result, I'm still no more enlightened.  I can't quite figure out from 
reading the parser what values to put where, as it seems to expect a few 
more than I have.  Any tips?
Ta,
Matt
