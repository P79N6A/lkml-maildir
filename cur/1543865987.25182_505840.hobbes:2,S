Honestly, no.  But it is better and more accurate to do it.

We can calibrate CPU frequency pretty accurately, despite being in a VM 
where time does not operate in the normal way.  Many other hypervisors 
won't be able to do such a good job, or might not implement the required 
hardware.
Adding this hook allows everyone to just re-use all the frequency 
scaling / recalibration code in tsc.c.
The primary justification is allowing code re-use, which is why I 
allowed myself to add a hook.  I also want paravirt-ops to be as minimal 
as possible.
