this particular testbox has seen *thousands* of development kernels of all
sizes, and i often have filled up the complete /boot partition. It is very
unlikely that this harmless (and not too big) 2.5.29 kernel would have
been the first one to trigger a 'wrong' CHS combination. Especially since
2.4 kernels with exactly the *same* bzImage (and same lilo) work just
fine.
