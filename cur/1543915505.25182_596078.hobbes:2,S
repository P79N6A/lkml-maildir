Hmm, I don't like returning array which someone allocated in past and forgot.
And, area->page[] array under vmalloc() is allocated as following (in -rc6-mm1)
==
       if (array_size > PAGE_SIZE) {
                pages = __vmalloc_node(array_size, gfp_mask | __GFP_ZERO,
                                        PAGE_KERNEL, node);
                area->flags |= VM_VPAGES;
        } else {
                pages = kmalloc_node(array_size,
                                (gfp_mask & GFP_RECLAIM_MASK) | __GFP_ZERO,
                                node);
        }

A bit complicating.
At least, please add comments "How to free page-array returned by vummap"
Thanks,
