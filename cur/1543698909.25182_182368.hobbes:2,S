No, or possibly that might be another way around that bush too.  It 
turned out that there was a missing call in my bash install, and the 
bash from fedora had it.  Installing the same bash from fedora fixed 
it all right up.  Compile options difference.

Latest bug/security-fix glibc is installed.  Dunno about nptl, or even 
what that puppy does.
FWIW, my other amanda problem wherein it wouldn't load and search the 
tape magazine it it wasn't already loaded seems to have been fixed by 
adding a define in my configdir/chg-scsi.conf, nameing the 
SCSItapedev = /dev/sg0, where the robot is sg1 at LUN 1, same device 
addr.  Normally the drive is /dev/nst0, but for that query, it has to 
come through /dev/sg0 for some reason.  2.4 kernels didn't have a 
problem with that, 2.6.0-test11 at least did.  And there hadn't been 
any changes to the chg-scsi stuff in amanda since 2001 so that cannot 
be blamed on "newer versionitis". :)
So there are apparently two solutions to the first problem, and at 
least one to the second above.
