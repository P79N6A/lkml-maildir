With or without your suggestion, people have to do something
different.
This doesn't even address all the problems there are with
the hidden patch.  It does things that belong on the netfilter
level and not on the ARP/routing level.
Again, I'd like you to read all the discussions that have happened on
this topic in the past, in particular those made by Alexey Kuznetsov
on this topic.  He gives very clear and concise reasons why the
"hidden" patch is logically doing things in the wrong part of the
kernel, and therefore won't ever be put into the tree.
