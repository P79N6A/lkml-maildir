Subject: tcp_hashinfo exported or not?

I'm having some slight issues with using tcp_hashinfo in 2.4.19.  It
appears to be exported (net/netsyms.c), appears in the System.map
generated, but when I try to load a module that makes use of it, insmod
claims it isn't there (and isn't listed in /proc/ksyms either,
explaining why insmod complains).
Is there any voodoo that I have to do to make use of this symbol in a
module?
thanks,
shaya
