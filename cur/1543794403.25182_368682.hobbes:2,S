The "Firmware error detected" message occurs regularly - fortunately, on
my system they cause no significant performance problem. If I understand
the code correctly, writes to the wrong memory location only happen at
the first firmware restart. (Unless certain debugging flags are set,
which isn't the case here.) So, basically, it happens exactly once after
each reboot, after a few minutes of network activity.
It's difficult to know the exact time when the filesystem corruption
happened, as it usually isn't noticed immediately.
