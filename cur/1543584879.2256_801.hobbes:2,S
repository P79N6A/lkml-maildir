I have uploaded the first working version of a patch for Linux-2.4.2 to
ftp://ftp.kernel.org
:/pub/linux/daemons/ntp/PPS/PPS-2.4.2-pre5.diff.bz2
The patch is mostly equivalent to PPSkit-1.0.3, execpt lacking support
for CIOGETEV. Actually it seems that ATOM won't work without CIOGETEV,
but I'll have to re-investigate...
I would appreciate any feedback (see /usr/src/linux/CREDITS for EMail address)
Regards,
Ulrich
