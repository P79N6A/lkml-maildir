I think I used one of those systems once (or at least another one with
.snapshot feature).  It managed to completely avoid user space problems
by never actually showing .snapshot in directory listings, but you could
always cd to it or refer to it explicitly.  You never risked having tar
or find or anything else accidentally pick it up.  Very nice interface.
