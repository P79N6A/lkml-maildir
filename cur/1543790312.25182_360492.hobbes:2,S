But that makes no sense.  /proc/*/mounts changes when mount tree changes.
Which is obviously not an event happening to block devices.  Moreover,
changes of mount tree may involve no changes in the set of active filesystems
or be separated in time from such changes by arbitrary intervals.
Looks like seriously wrong assumptions in userland code working with these
events...  _IF_ you want to keep track of /proc/*/mounts changes, the obvious
solution would be to implement ->poll() for them.  However, if you are
really interested in block devices, keep in mind that
	* getting them claimed happens before your event is generated
	* eventually the filesystem claiming them becomes active (or doesn't,
if mount fails)
	* eventually an active fs may (or may not) become visible in mount
tree.
	* not every umount leads to deactivation
	* deactivation can happen long after the fs is no longer present in
mount tree
	* fs may become visible in mount tree again without being deactivated
and activated again - (mount /dev/foo /mnt; exec </mnt/bar; umount -l /mnt;
sleep 100; mount /dev/foo /tmp/barf) in case of block filesystem will do just
that; fs gets activated, mounted, unmounted and mounted again 100 seconds
later.
	* deactivated fs gives up its claim on device(s).  Incidentally,
your UMOUNT event is triggered before either thing happens; any amount of
IO on the device(s) can happen after it.
Oh, and there are things other than filesystems that can (and do) claim
block devices.
So what's really going on?  If you want to know when device gets busy, you
need events in fs/block_dev.c and no expectation regarding /proc/mounts.
If you want to know when mount tree changes, you need events on attach_mnt/
detach_mnt (and I would seriously suggest ->poll() rather than wanking with
events).  If you want something more complex, you might or might not be
SOL, depending on what you are trying to achieve.
