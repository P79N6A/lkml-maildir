We have a patch that we haven't submitted yet (out of mostlyt cowardice)
that makes this fully dynamic.  task->groups is dynamically allocated and
handled, and can grow up to a sysctl() defined maximum.
It has been working wonderfully for 10,000+ groups.  Does this patch have a
chance in hell of going standard?? (don't have the patch on hand, or I'd post
it).
