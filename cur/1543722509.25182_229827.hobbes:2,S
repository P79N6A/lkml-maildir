This looks cool, but I have some aesthetic nits about it:

If that's dead code, why not remove it?

Could you name those something more explicit, like swsusp_smp_freeze(),
etc, so you don't have potential namespace conflicts?

What is this? It looks completely gratuitous.

This also looks completely gratuitous and confusing - if you're not doing
anything else but calling the __function, then why even create __function?

And, why are they exported in the first place?

Were there more files to the patch? Some of the ones listed here were not
in the email?
BTW, nice work.
