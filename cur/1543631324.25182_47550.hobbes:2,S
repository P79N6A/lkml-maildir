Where the *hell* - did I say that the above program was supposed
to be ANSI C ?#$@#! It's in my own
advanced/object oriented/intuitive/component/virtual machine
based mdcki-c-alike-python commercial closed source language
I'm developing to provide a replacement base for the next
generation of Rudy102 distro configuration utilities if you ask. OK?

have scheduled it for the first public release.
Any questions remaining?
