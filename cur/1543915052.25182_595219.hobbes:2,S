It should be mostly possible to ifdef a nopage() handler, which is
just a wrapper function to translate arguments then call your new
->fault() handler. With luck, fault would mostly inline into nopage,
and do some constant folding to make it cheaper...
I'm planning to go through and convert the rest of the in-tree users
at some point soon, so if you do get a chance to convert your
upstream code before I try, it would nice ;)
Thanks,
Nick
