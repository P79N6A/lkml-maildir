They're living a lie :)  A readiness event does not guarantee future
operations, it provides a hint of the status of things at the time the
event was generated.  Networking events can happen that change the status
of sockets from when readiness events come in and when the app tries to
react to them..
	- kernel gets ack, freeing tx queue space
	- the kernel wakes up the task with some POLL_OUT event
	- a packet comes in from the wire that resets the socket
	- the app sees poll_out and tries to write, and is surprised
there are many more situations like this.  readiness is _always_ only
a hint, and the app has to deal with this.
