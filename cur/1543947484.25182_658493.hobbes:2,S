Yup, but you cut the CONTEXT where I said:
"for very large SMP systems"
Specifically, what I mean, is an SMP system, where I have enough CPUs to
do this:
let (t_Tcs) be the time to lock, transition and unlock an un-contended
critical section (i.e. the one that I am the pending waiter for).
let (t_W) be the time to wake up a sleeping task.
and let (t_W > t_Tcs)
Then, "for very large SMP systems"
if 
S = (t_W / t_Tcs), 
then S designates the number of tasks to transition a critical section
before the first sleeper would wake up.
and the number of CPUs > S.
The time for an arbitrary number of tasks N > S which are all competing
for lock L, to transition a critical section (T_N_cs), approaches:
T_N_cs = (N * t_W) 
if you have only 1 task spinning.
but if you can have 
N tasks spinning, (T_N_cs) approaches:
T_N_cs = (N * t_Tcs)
and with the premise, that t_W > t_Tcs, you should see a dramatic
throughput improvement when running PREEMPT_RT on VERY LARGE SMP
systems.
I want to disclaim, that the math above is very much simplified, but I
hope its sufficient to demonstrate the concept.
I have to acknowledge Ingo's comments, that this is all suspect until
proven to make a positive difference in "non-marketing" workloads.
I personally *think* we are past that already, and the adaptive concept
can and will be extended and scaled as M-socket and N-core based SMP
proliferates into to larger grid-based systems. But there is plenty more
to do to prove it.
(someone send me a 1024 CPU box and a wind-powered-generator)
