So you are still advocating for a KConfig enhancement?
Could you try to describe the layout of a KConfig file that you
have in mind.
I gave it a shot:
It must specify - 
a) Objects file used for the driver
b) module name of the driver
c) optional object files used by that driver
d) data used by the driver, for example PCI Data?
e) other stuff?
driver MAXTOR_SATA "SATA for Maxtor IDE"
	depends on LIB_SATA
	kbuild
	  obj-$(MAXTOR_SATA)  := maxtorsata.o
	  maxtorsata-y := libsata.o smaxtor.o
	  maxtorsata-$(VERBOSE_LOGGING) += maxtorlog.o
	data
	  PCIDEVICE(X,Y)
Not complete - and no dought with some missing pieces.
Primarly to try to find out what you have in mind.
