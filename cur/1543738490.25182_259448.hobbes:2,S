The problem is: trying enable some local apic's (for example on via
mother boards on my laptop), cause many problem, like hang on boot (with
ACPI), hang on Fn-F3 (video switch), power-off fails, etc. and no one
knows how resolved the problem.  
So keep it disable if BIOS vendors say so, can be reasonable idea.
