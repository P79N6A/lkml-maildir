Hello,
 I've recently added a second drive to my workstation and since then I'm
getting the following error from time to time:
  Apr 25 20:42:06 beowulf kernel: hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x64
  Apr 25 20:42:06 beowulf kernel: hda: lost interrupt
  Apr 25 20:42:06 beowulf kernel: hda: dma_intr: bad DMA status (dma_stat=70)
  Apr 25 20:42:06 beowulf kernel: hda: dma_intr: status=0x50 { DriveReady 
   SeekComplete }
Both drives are new Maxtors (60 and 40GB) on the VIA KT266 chipset (the mobo
is MSI K7T266 Pro2-A mobo):

  Of course, when the above happens, all disk I/O freezes. The above happens
only when there's simultaneous activity on both devices. It doesn't happen
when the devices are on different IDE interfaces. The transfer is always
retried and completed successfully, so it's not a bad hdd and I can only
guess the problem is somewhere in the DMA/IRQ handling by the IDE driver. If
there's not enough information to diagnose/solve the problem, I can do more
tests (run with 2.4 for a while, run with the generic IDE drive etc.).
TIA,
marek
