  But with which lock you'd like to lock-around i_size update? Note that
you have to make sure you won't race even with read path which currently
doesn't take any locks at all (except for page lock) if I'm right... So,
e.g. NFS, would have to wrap generic_file_aio_read() in some lock to
prevent inode updates while generic_file_aio_read() runs. That doesn't
sound too appealing to me.
