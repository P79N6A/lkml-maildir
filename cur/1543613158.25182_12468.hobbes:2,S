That's why these boundary limitations need to be known by the layer
build the requests for you.

First of all, virt_to_bus just cannot work on some archetectures that
are just slightly more advanced than x86. I'm quite sure Davem is ready
to lecture you on this.
Second, you are misunderstanding the need of a page/offset instead of
virtua_address model. It's _not_ for > 4GB machines, it's for machines
with highmem. You'll need this on the standard kernel to I/O above
860MB, that that is definitely a much bigger part of the market. Heck,
lots of home users have 1GB or more with the RAM prices these days.
