bind9 actually sets inheritable, but I don't see it doing any exec in
the whole package, so it should be safe. I'll look for other large
common packages using capabilities.
I don't think this necessarily is 2.7 material, but otoh if it has
waited this long there doesn't appear to be that kind of rush to get it
in.

However I never saw any real clean solution for the problem and I would
call this better and more general for this kind of problems.

Thanks, I'll have a look at this.
