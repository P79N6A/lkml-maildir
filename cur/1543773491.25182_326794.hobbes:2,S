No, see, when you hot-add /dev/nbd1, the kernel md resync thread
begins processing the resync.  The resync operation on two nbds
involves:
   1) Send data request packet from nbd0
   2) Wait for response
   3) Send data packet to nbd1
   4) Wait for response
   5) Repeat until done
On a normal net device, the "Send data request packet" causes the
system to drop the packet on the wire and go away to do other stuff
for a while, whereas on the loopback, it can schedule immediately
to the process receiving the packet, which is the kernel itself.
The kernel then processes the packet and returns the result, over
the loopback.  It then sends the response to the other server over
a real net connection.  During most of this time, the kernel is
taking big locks and turning interrupts off and on and such, causing
massive hangs until resync finishes.  Since you mentioned bad write
performance with your RAID controller, I suspect its driver may also
turn off interrupts, take excessive locks, or do other madness,
further worsening system responsiveness.

make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the  
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious  
deficiencies.
