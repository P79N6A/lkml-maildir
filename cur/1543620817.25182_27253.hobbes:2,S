Hey all.  I am not-so new to Linux, but I haven't had to recompile my kernel before.  We are taking the leap into Samba Fileserving an thus, I need to add ACL functionality to my kernel.  I have opted to go with 2.4.17 and have had some success so far.  I am, however, stuck at one point.
I am trying to make my .img file to support my RAID devices.  When I run:
/sbin/mkinitrd /boot/initrd-2.4.17-021102.img 2.4.17-021102
I get the message:
All of your loopback devices are in use!
I don't really understand why this is preventing me from creatingthe .img file.  But then again, I have little experience in this area.  I was hoping somebody on this list could len a hand.  Thanks alot guys (and the occasional gal).
