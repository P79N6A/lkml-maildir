Those have been problematic in the past.  I am just wondering if this
will be a latency regression, or if changes elsewhere in your patch
negate the effect.
I'm just concerned because it was a lot of work over ~2 years to get 2.6
to perform decently in this area, and we have regressed since 2.6.14 (VM
issue).
