No there are not, at least not for the libc which everybody uses.  FC
comes with three versions.  They each have increasing kernel
requirements.  The normally used version assumes a recent kernel (2.4.20
in FC1, hopefully 2.6.x in FC2) which allows to eliminate all
compatibility with older kernels.  This cuts out almost all of the
cruft.  The other libcs are for various degrees of backward
compatibility for apps which do not follow the API rules and depend on
non-guaranteed behavior of one sort or another.
Anyway, if you add the d_type field after the string and we do the
memmove that already much better than what we have to do today.
