Hi,
instantly after switching from 2.4.21-pre6 to 2.4.22-ac1 I get loads of
that in logs:
fh_verify: no root_squashed access at my-dir
where my-dir is a subdirectory of parent which is exported to
several machines, and is also remounted locally for some reason ;-)
what has changed?
thanks in advence, Pawel
