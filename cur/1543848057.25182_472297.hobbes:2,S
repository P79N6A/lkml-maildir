Well, there is no fancy iommu mapping ... yet.
It's been implemented and is coming after we put together some
workarounds for various other spider hardware issues that trigger when
using it (bogus prefetches and bogus pci ordering).
I think the hypervisor based platforms will be happy with that patch
too.
