Hi Ulrich,
I just now quickly tried to with klibc-1.5 on i386 with the 
PIE-randomization patched kernel, and it seems to load static libraries 
fine.
I just downloaded klibc-1.5, built it, and executed a few of the programs 
in usr/utils/static, all of them worked. Does this also work for you and 
you are experiencing the problems solely when the binaries are being run 
from initramfs during boot?
I will test more shortly (on x86_64, directly from initramfs) in order to 
reproduce.
Thanks,
