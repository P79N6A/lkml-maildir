The wrong time (for me anyway) is when/or around the time in which kernel 
is auto-detecting arrays/udev starts, when I put it there I get OOPSES all 
over the screen and it gets really nasty.  Basically the best time appears 
to be right after the system has started up but I/O hasn't started hitting 
the array yet.  Tricky, I know.
