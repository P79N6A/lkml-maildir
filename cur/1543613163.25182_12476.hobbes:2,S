Andrea,
I disabled ntfs and as you suspected my problem went away. This worked
for both 2.4.16 and 2.4.17pre4aa1.
Thanks a lot,

|   In short there are three solutions avaialble:
| 
|   1) don't use ntfs
|   2) fix ntfs
|   3) enlarge vmalloc address space with the above patch, but this won't be
|      a final solution because you'll overflow again the vmalloc address
|      space by adding the double of files in your fs
| 
|   So I'd redirect this report to Anton Altaparmakov <aia21@cam.ac.uk> and
|   I still have no VM bugreport pending from my part.
