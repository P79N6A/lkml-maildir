Hi,
This is my first kernel patch, so please go easy on me :)
What it does is conditionally enable -march=k6-2 and -march=k6-3, and provide options for each in the Processor Type and Features menu.
This is conditional on the compiler supporting it; as of this writing only GCC 3.1 does. I compiled this kernel successfully with this patch on my K6-III and am presently running this kernel.
It also enables 3DNow in the case of the K6-III; I wasn't sure if 3DNow might imply the extended Athlon 3DNow instructions, so I only enabled it for the K6-III, which I know supports it.
Anyhow, that's all.
David Bronaugh
ps: This is pretty trivial to apply for other CPUs too; as I understand it several different CPU types gained their own architecture strings with GCC 3.1
