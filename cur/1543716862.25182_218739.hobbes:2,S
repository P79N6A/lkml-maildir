That's actually what ppc64 does.  But, they do it via /proc (not even
from inside the kernel).  I'm not very fond of that solution :)

We'll probably end up having to lock down hotplug around the time that
someone *needs* persistent information about memory layout from
userspace.  Think crashdump...

That's a good point.  Some of the happy consumers of this should be
things like crashdump and kexec.  They might want a choice to either
dump only the memory that Linux is currently using, or to know about all
of the memory that is present.

There can be some pretty generic (although asynchronous) events given
via /sbin/hotplug.  I'm currently planning on having the memory hotplug
"drivers" get the hot-added memory ready, but keep it offline.  It then
creates some kobjects, which generate hotplug events, and *then* the
decision can be made in the hotplug scripts about what to do with it.
