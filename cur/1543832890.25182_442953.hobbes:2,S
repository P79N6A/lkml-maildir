agree. should I prepare a patch?

Yeah, I also noticed these nasty loops but was too lazy to bother :)
Too much crap for my nerves :)
Your logic looks fine for me. Do we have already round_up_pow_of_two() function or
should we create it as something like:
unsinged long round_up_pow_of_two(unsigned long x)
{
  unsigned long res = 1 << BITS_PER_LONG;
  while (res > x)
    res >>= 1;
  }
  return res << 1;
}
or maybe using:
n = find_first_bit(x);
return res = 1 << n;
(though it depends on endianness IMHO)
?
Thanks,
Kirill
