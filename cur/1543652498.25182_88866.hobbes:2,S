   Still running 2.5.46, put more memory in this machine (I need it
anyway, 256mb for what I do is truly masochistic) and now I have 384Mb.
 This time when pressuring memory (ever setup KDevelop for the first
time and index your documentation? not pretty) things got a bit
sluggish, then I tuned vm.swappiness to 50 (from 0).  About a minute
later it began swapping a bit
more, and things are much better.  When vm.swappiness was at 0, 1300 bytes
were swapped.  As I'm writing this, (vm.swappiness at 100) 39448 bytes are
swapped, after less than five minutes.
