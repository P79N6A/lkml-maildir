Maybe its best then to restrict this definition to glibc? Glibc can muck
around with these bits and then call either
clock_gettime(clocktype,&timespec)
or
clock_process_gettimer(pid, type/clocktype,&timespec)
That way the glibc guys have full control and the kernel does not have
to deal with the bit mongering.

How will you provide the necessary hardware interface for the kernel
clocks?

Ok then we might best follow my above suggestion. Put the timer stuff
into a separate .c file as you have already done. Rename it to something
like process_clocks.c. posix-timers.c will then only be an interface to a
variety of hardware clocks that glibc may use at will.
