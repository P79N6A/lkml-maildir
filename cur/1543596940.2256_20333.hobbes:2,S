Sometime memory ordering pays off by avoiding locks, but this isn't the
case ;).

It certainly isn't overkill in respect of doing get_bh in an implicitly
sychronized points where we submit the I/O (that was my second argument
and that was plain wrong).
My first arguments about "overkill" were for async I/O and kiobufs, where
the race cannot trigger. Mainly for the kiobufs I/O I'm still not very
convinced.

yes, agreed.
