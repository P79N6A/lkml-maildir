The explanation has been given several times: the solution used by Linux
solves much more than just CD recorders.
I intentionally say "CD recorders", not "SCSI devices" nor even "CD drives",
because I don't think I can view as a consistent solution anything which
calls the same drive differently depending on whether I want to read or
write a CD.
I repeatedly asked you why do you think we should call the device
differently for different uses and there were no replies.

As you were already told, you can do it by splitting the Linux port
to two, one for Linux 2.4 and older, one for the newer kernels. Some
people even offered help with maintaining the Linux parts of the libscg.
Except for the compatibility problems, I haven't heard any argument
why it "could not be used reliably on Linux".
				Have a nice fortnight
