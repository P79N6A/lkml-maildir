Yes, but the fact is that is really is invalid use of mutex -- because the 
mutex owner could become seriously wrong after fork() or sending the 
filedescriptor through unix socket ... this easily leads to broken 
situation.
This seems to have been introduced in e824290e5d ... Alessandro, could you 
convert this to test_and_set_bit()/clear_bit() semantics instead of a 
mutex please?
Thanks,
