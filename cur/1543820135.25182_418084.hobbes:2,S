Yes, this one looks much better.
The keyboard part of the device is OK, but the multimedia/mouse part is
totally FUBAR. Adding support for any keys that are not making it
through should be trivial, but making it not appear as a crazy joystick
is not realistically possible: The device insists on that it IS a device
from hell with almost all possible valuators defined in the HID spec.
