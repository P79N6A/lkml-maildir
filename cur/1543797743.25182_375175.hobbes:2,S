Actually yes, because something is clearly wrong.
The pci 9200 SE can run tuxracer at 640x480 - not smooth
but playable until it locks the machine after a few minutes.
The AGP matrox G550 is better, it runs 1280x1024 tuxracer
with a unknown but noticeable higher framerate.  According to
people I talked to before, the 9200SE is supposed to outperform
this, even with a pci bus.  But it is not even close and I don't
bother running 3D on it any more due to the hanging.

I don't mind a game crash - I can always find another game.  But it will
at least screw up that card so bad that I need a reboot to get
a working xserver running on that display.  Typically, the
crash ends with a 99% cpu loop in the kernel, a blocked display,
and perhaps the other xserver gets in trouble too.

Nope.  A windows crash isn't any "better", and they are used to
the linux-level of stability anyway.
