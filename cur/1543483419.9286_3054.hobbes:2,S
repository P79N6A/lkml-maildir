    Not to be rude, but the man has already given a df of what he says
    is his largest machine.  If 43mb isn't large enough for a kernel
    built on that machine, it doesn't seem that difficult to grasp the
    concept that he doesn't have enough room to compile the kernel.
    If you want to provide him with a `better machine', give him an
    account on one of your machines and let him build kernels there.
