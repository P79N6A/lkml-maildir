I don't want to put that there. the problem is serial8250_set_mctrl 
called by will clear DTR bit.
uart_set_options==>serial8250_set_termios ==> serial8250_set_mctrl will 
clear DTR bit

static void serial8250_set_mctrl(struct uart_port *port, unsigned int mctrl)
{
struct uart_8250_port *up = (struct uart_8250_port *)port;
unsigned char mcr = 0;
if (mctrl & TIOCM_RTS)
mcr |= UART_MCR_RTS;
