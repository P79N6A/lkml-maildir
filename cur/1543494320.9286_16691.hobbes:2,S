I actually think that you don't need either of those constraints.  What
you *do* need, however, are separate r, w and x permissions on each
page.  Also the instruction set needs to be amenable to these kinds of
scans; most RISCs are.  You only need to keep each page in one of two
states: writable or executable.  When you write to an executable page,
you get a trap, and flip it to the other state; when you execute, you
again get a trap, scan the page, and put it back in the executable
state.
