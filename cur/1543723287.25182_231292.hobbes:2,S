Hang on, the PCI (and DMA) API explicitly states that to call sync on a
dma mapped area, you must do it for the *whole* of the area.  The API's
also transfer ownership of the area (i.e. only the device *or* the
driver may touch it depending on who has the ownership). This is
designedly to get us out of cache line interference problems.
So the particular problem here is an incorrect *abuse* of the API. 
There is a section in the black magic part of the DMA API that allows
you partially to sync a mapped area (dma_sync_single_range).  However,
it's in the experts only section and it explains that if you do this,
you're responsible for preventing cache line interference and provides
another API (dma_get_cache_alignment) explicitly so the driver knows
what the cache line boundaries are.

Precisely, hence the ownership concept.

Clearly the e100 needs fixing.  Either by migrating it to the expert
API. Or, in this case, could we not just pad the structure with
appropriate L1_CACHE_ALIGNMENT tags?
