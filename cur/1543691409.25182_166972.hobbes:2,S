Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.23 Failure to reload partitions past 1TB
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

parted fails when creating partitions > 1TB.
If anyone doesn't like my assumption of 32bit long,
feel free to fix it, or tell me the apropriate method.
 Enough assumptions are made about that in this code
that I don't feel too bad, and no MAXULONG seems
defined in the kernel tree.
Please CC me on replies.
