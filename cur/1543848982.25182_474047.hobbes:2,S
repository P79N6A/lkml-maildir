Version information first: This is 2.6.19-rc1, not mm1.  I apparently
forgot to apply the mm1 patch before compiling it.
I got a BUG, which I could write down by getting X out of the way first.
It is repeatable, just ask if I omitted something cruical. On bootup,
the verbose debugging complains about read errors on sdc,
I guess the kernel tries to get the partition table.  I have no idea
why there is read errors - that shouldn't hang anything though.
To bring it down:
dd if=/dev/sdc of=sdc.dump bs=1M
sd 0:0:0:2 ioctl_internal_command return code: 8000002
 :Current: Sense key: Hardware Error
  Additional Sense: End_of_data detected

<0>Kernel Panic - not syncing fatal exception in interrupt
<0>Rebooting in 300 seconds
It did reboot in 300 seconds, I had to crash twice to get this much written down.
I checked that stuff written down the first time was identical.
Invalid opcode suggest a compiler bug or memory scribble, or possibly
calling a bad function pointer. The crash is trivial to reproduce,
just ask me.
