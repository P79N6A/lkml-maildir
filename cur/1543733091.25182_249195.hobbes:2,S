Some run Linux because it _works_, and also want to play.

How do you know?

How do you know the OOPSes aren't caused (indirectly) by nVidia? Sure, the
incidence seems to have gone down, and perhaps lusers have learnt not to
post OOPSes for tainted kernels...

Now you confuse me... you see _many_ OOPSes with nVidia, but know for
_sure_ nVidia has nothing to do with it?

Try using a 1280x800 screen (wide notebook screen, as on Toshiba M30), nv
says that is incorrect and gives you a (very distorted) 1024x768. Up to
here, the binary module is the only way out for me (and I don't care for 3D
or high-performance 2D).

Right.
