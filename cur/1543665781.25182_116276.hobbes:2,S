This is a big thing. I created a webserver based on MTasker
(ds9a.nl/mtasker) that used select, poll or epoll and it was very hard to
abstract this properly as level and edge semantics differ so wildly.
Most programs will not abandon 'legacy' interfaces like poll and select and
will only want to offer epoll in addition. Right now that is hard to do.
I implemented this by 'relevelling' the edgeness of epoll, which is double
work.

I'd vote for 2.
