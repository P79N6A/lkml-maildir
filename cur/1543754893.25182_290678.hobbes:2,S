Good grief no!
If you're going to try something like this, it needs to be a separate
patch over the scsi-list for one thing.  And to save time:
1) The patch is actually wrong.  There's more than one caching mode page
and not all of them affect current behaviour.
2) We have a current interface to update the WCE bit:  You twiddle all
the disc parameters and then trigger a device rescan via sysfs (I'll
check that this updates the cache bits, I think it does, but if it
doesn't I'll make it).
3) If we think this is a quantity the users would like to see and alter,
then reading and setting it should be exported via sysfs.
4) Snooping SCSI commands is really bad ... it can get you into all
sorts of trouble which is why we prefer asking the device what state
it's in to trying to guess ourselves.
