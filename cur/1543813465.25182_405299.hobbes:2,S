Can not ... because of down_read(s_umount) before checking s_root :(
So what do we do now?
 1. always get the reference counting right outside of dcache_lock
 2. hack around with different paths for prune_dcache() when called from
    shrink_dcache_memory() and shrink_dcache_parent()
I think that we should go for the first.
