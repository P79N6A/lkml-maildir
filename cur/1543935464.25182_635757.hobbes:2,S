Well, I can give you a three liner, and if it stops working, I'll
treat is as a regression, because userland ABI changed...?
Or you can get about 10 lines of C, no problem, but I do not think
that should be merged to Linus.

I do not think TCP would survive "10 seconds sleep, 1 second up". But...

...yes, we should probably play with the routers.

 I expect to stress s2ram way too much ;-).
