You can execute existing static-linked files by having ld.so execute
them. Ld.so "knows" how to execute static-linked files. You just
need to change kernel code to include the static executable magic
number with the dynamic linked magic number as requiring the
preprocessing of the dynamic linker.
The only problem is that 'init' won't start if that loader isn't
available. This not a problem for working systems. It's just a
problem for broken ones. You use an unpatched kernel for maintenance.
