It's a slightly older P3B-F board with Intel IDE. It's not my system, but it 
has been running fine as long as I can remember.

The IDE disk layout is:
IDE pri: HD + HD
IDE sec: CD + HD
The RAID is constructed from IDE primary master + secondary slave. (40 + 30 GB 
disks)

Hm, wherever. ;)  The problem manifested itself right after a reboot. Postfix 
complained at boot about dirs in spool/postfix not owned by postfix and at 
some point the fs was remounted ro. I dunno where to look, maybe it's indeed 
MD RAID + ext3 like Andreas pointed out?
