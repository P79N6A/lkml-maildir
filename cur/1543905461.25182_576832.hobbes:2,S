Please attach the output from acpidump to 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7880
We'll likely be able to tell from it if that patch
has any real effect on your system, or if you test
result was from some unrelated event.
Also, please test with CONFIG_X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ=n
to remove the acpi-cpufreq driver (and thus this patch)
from your kernel.  If it still fails, then we know
that this driver (and this patch) are not related
to the failure.

Hmmm, okay, the "big hammer" works.  Please see
if any of these smaller hammers work:
pnpacpi=off
acpi=noirq
notsc
