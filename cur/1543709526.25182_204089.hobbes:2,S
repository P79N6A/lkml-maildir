This is actually broken at the moment as it won't know how to fetch
stuff from old/ when it's given a non-current bk version. I have a
design assumption that I can go from a version name to a URL without
any lookups, which the snapshot dir purging breaks.
ISTR Jeff maintains the snapshot scripts. Jeff, could you possibly
have it put a copy of the each snapshot in old/ at creation time
rather than moving stuff there at a later point? This will make URLs
pointing to old/ for -bk patches stable but shouldn't break anything
else.

I suppose I could add a 2.6-tip, which will return the greatest of
2.6, 2.6-pre, and 2.6-bk. Like this:
$ kpatchup -s 2.6-tip
2.6.4-rc2
$ kpatchup -u 2.6-tip
