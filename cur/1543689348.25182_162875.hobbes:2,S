Please, this makes no sense. Why do you think IBM and others make large
machines? Stupidity? From my experience they're hard assed "if it don't
make a profit, nor is likely to, then it can piss off" marketeers. Which
often pisses me off, but still ... if it didn't make money, they wouldn't
do it. And no, I can't go get you internal confidential sales figures,
but I'll bet you we're not selling these things at a loss for our own
general self-flagellating amusement.
I don't think you're stupid, but please ... who do you think has better
data on this? IBM market research people? or you? I think I'd bet on IBM.
