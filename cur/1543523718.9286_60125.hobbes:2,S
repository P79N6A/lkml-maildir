A few minutes, when not used, through kmod (2.2.x) or kerneld (2.0.x).

Presumably the tape needs a SCSI reset for some reason (can be because
of a Linux bug).

Do one of:
- force the st module to be loaded at boot time
  On Debian:  echo st >> /etc/modules
  Or add in rc.local or similar:  /sbin/insmod st
  [this will additionnally fix the `not enough buffers' BUG which can
   happen if the st module is loaded and unloaded repetitively and
   memory is very fragmented, leading to performance problems]
- compile the st module in the kernel, not as modules.
