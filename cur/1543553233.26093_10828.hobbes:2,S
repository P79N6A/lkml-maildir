I think one of the "rules" is that the 2.2.x kernel shouldn't require an
upgrade of userspace tools, such as modutils in this case.
So 2.2 would still require the driver scripts if you want to support
dynamic module loading on USB device insertion, but this makes yet
another good reason to move to 2.4 when it is available :)
