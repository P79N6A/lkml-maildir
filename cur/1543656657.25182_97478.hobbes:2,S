The target, i.e., the label 'goto' would be the reserved page for the
system call. The whole purpose was to minimize the number of CPU cycles
necessary to call 0xfffff000 and return. The system call does not have
issue a 'far' return, it can do anything it requires. The page at
0xfffff000 is mapped into every process and is in that process CS space
already.
I have already gotten responses from people who looked at the code
and said it was broken. It is not broken. It does what is expected.
It takes the same number of CPU cycles as:
		pushl	$0xfffff000
		call	*(%esp)
		addl	$4, %esp
... which is the current proposal. It has the advantage that only
the return address is on the stack when the target code is executed.
