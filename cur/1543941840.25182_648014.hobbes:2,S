Hi Bart,
here are the pending ide-tape patches reworked which incorporate all review
points raised so far. Several new patches are appended to the original series
which i thought would be reasonable to sumbit along with the others. Also,
i've applied "ide-tape: dump gcw fields on error in idetape_identify_device()"
which is #12 and which you can simply ignore. Furthermore, #32 from the original
series got split up into the different logical changes it dealt with, as you
requested.
