What's "truth" ? Why do you think I'm need information written on HDD ? I'm not.
What I need in 99% cases is working HDD. Yes, sometimes it's good to have
information directly from HDD (if you'll get not RawCHS != 16383/16/63 for
HDD > 8GiB you can be sure that something is wrong; sometimes serial number
can be needed, etc) but in most cases you are more interested in kernel
imagination about HDD. And IF kernel belives in "truth" that RawCHS is
16383/16/63 (Wichert'scase) you are in trouble. If kernel believes in "lie"
like shown above (my case) you are fine.

It gives you info from kernel. And in most cases it's what you want.
Yes, it's not info from HDD but it's what's needed.
