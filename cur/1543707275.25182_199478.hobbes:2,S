Neat, but it's hard to see the relevance of this to your patch.
I don't see any licensing issues with the patch because the filesystem
which needs it clearly meets Linus's "this is not a derived work" criteria.
And I don't see a technical problem with the export: given that we export
truncate_inode_pages() it makes sense to also export the corresponding
pagetable shootdown function.
Yes, this is a sensitive issue.  Can we please evaluate it strictly
according to technical and licensing considerations?
Having said that, what concerns issues remain with Paul's patch?
Thanks.
