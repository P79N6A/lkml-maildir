Hi All
I have been trying to get ipchains support in the 2.4.10 kernel.
I do a make xconfig and it's greyed out.
Has ipchains support been dropped and is this just an artifact??
Iptables support works but some of the modules have undefineds when they
are loaded.
This symbol problem for iptables seems to come and go in 2.4.x kernels.
I complie support into the kernel and everything else as modules.
John
