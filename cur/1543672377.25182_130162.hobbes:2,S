Hi all,
If this is not the mailing list to ask this question - please let me know
where should I ask it.
I have an executable whose size is almost 2MB, and it uses a shared object
that is almost 2MB.
when I run the process, I see (using "top") that the amount of "used memory"
raises with 4MB. (make sence...). the process seem to share 2MB ("shared"
column).
When the process forks, it seems that the amount of "used memory" raises
with 4MB again.
Does it mean the shared object is not really shared ? That doesn't make
sence...
Help is appreciated.
Please CC me because I am not subscribed.
Thanks,
Nir
