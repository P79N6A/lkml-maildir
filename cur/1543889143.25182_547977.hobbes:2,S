Eww. I don't see where we disable the decode at all while we probe the 
BARs on the device. That seems like a bad thing, especially with the way 
we probe 64-bit BARs (do the low 32 bits first and then the high 32 
bits). This means the base address effectively gets set to 0xfffffff0 
momentarily, which might cause some issues.
I'd try adding some code inside pci_setup_device (drivers/pci/probe.c) 
to disable PCI_COMMAND_IO and PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY on the device when 
probing devices with the standard header type and then restoring the 
previous command bits afterwards, and see what effect that has. It'll be 
  interesting if it does, since obviously it seems to work as it is with 
non-MMCONFIG access methods. Maybe the base address being set like that 
interferes with MMCONFIG access itself somehow?
