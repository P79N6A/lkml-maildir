Hmmm, that explains why this didn't work. :( So if I wanted to do this 
completely from user space using only block_dump data I'd probably have 
to go through all files and find out if they had any blocks in common 
with my preload set -- presuming there is a way to find that out, which 
there probably isn't. That  makes this idea pretty much useless, I'm 
sorry to have bothered you with it.
