Hi,
No fix, but behaviour confirmed ..
	greetings,
	Rob van Nieuwkerk
>   Hi, all. I've finally sat down and looked at a problem that's been
> annoying me for a long time: the es1371 driver in 2.4.x does not allow
> me to set the mic recording gain as high as the 2.2.x driver does.
> 
> With 2.2.20, the mixer channels SOUND_MIXER_MIC (7) and
> SOUND_MIXER_RECLEV (11) can both be adjusted to control the recoding
> level. The default levels are sufficient for my needs, and I can
> adjust them to a much higher level.
> 
> With 2.4.17-rc1, I can only control the recording level with
> SOUND_MIXER_IGAIN (12), and even setting it to the maximum 0x6464
> value does not yield a satisfactory recording level. Changing
> SOUND_MIXER_MIC (7) does not affect the recording level (unlike
> 2.2.x). Further, SOUND_MIXER_RECLEV (11) is not available for reading
> or writing.

> My guess is that the change in 2.3.x to use the ac97_codec driver for
> es1371 is the cause of this damage. Under 2.4.x, the maximum available
> recording level is barely usable for my application. Does anyone have
> a fix for this?
> 
> Note that when I say "recording level", I do mean recording. For later
> processing. I don't mean "gain from mic to headphones".
