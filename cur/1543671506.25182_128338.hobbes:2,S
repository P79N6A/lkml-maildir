What were you measuring? Code size or runtime memory consumption? It
looks a bit large for code size, but _very_ small for runtime.

Sounds interesting as well. Maybe we should add a central compression
library to the kernel. zlib is already central, but at least jffs2 and
ppp also have some other algorithms that could be moved and possibly
reused for other subsystems/drivers.
