Are you sure?  It used to.  Taking just one sample, pgd_none:
extern inline: alpha, parisc, s390
static inline: frv, ppc, sh64
define: arm, arm26, frv, h8300, m68knommu, ppc64, v850
I really don't think it makes any difference.  Such a function (returning
always 0) is always going to be inlined, and the only difference between
static inline and extern inline is what happens when it can't be inlined.
