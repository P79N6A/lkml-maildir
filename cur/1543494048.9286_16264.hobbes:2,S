The drive that is hdc should be put temporarily on hda or hdb and
partitioned there.  Then once it is done, put it back on hdc, and
your trouble should be gone.  I don't recall why this is so, but
I had a very similar problem when I got my new 4.3G Quantum a
ways back, and that was the solution that was given to me, which
worked too.  I now partition ALL hard disks on the primary
interface.
Note that only a first partition need be made like that.  Once a
partition exists on the drive, further partitions can be created
easily and work just fine no matter what interface the drive is
on.  Seems to me someone said it was a problem with LILO, or that
you could fix it by passing the kernel info about the drive that
the BIOS doesn't pass about drives beyond hdb or something...
Anyways, it works for me.  Good luck.
