  The dmesg contains only the following when I remove and insert the card.
<6>imx-mmc imx-mmc.0: card removed
<6>imx-mmc imx-mmc.0: card inserted
   Also I was looking through the code. I found this function for init
of mmc_blk (linux/drivers/mmc/mmc_block.c)
static int __init mmc_blk_init(void)
{
	int res = -ENOMEM;
	res = register_blkdev(major, "mmc");
	if (res < 0) {
		printk(KERN_WARNING "Unable to get major %d for MMC media: %d\n",
		       major, res);
		goto out;
	}
	if (major == 0)
		major = res;
	devfs_mk_dir("mmc");
	return mmc_register_driver(&mmc_driver);
 out:
	return res;
}
    This uses the function devfs_mk_dir() - defined in
linux/fs/devfs/base.c. I don't have devfs enabled in my kernel (kernel
version 2.6.16. In fact I don't even get an option to enable it in
menuconfig.). Can this be the cause of the problem?? I have found the
same code in the original kernel version too (the one from
kernel.org).
Thanks,
Midhun.
