Personally, I would much rather these were changed to "== NULL".
Different people have different preferences on whether to use
    ! foo
or
    foo == NULL
and the person who wrote that code is presumably showing a preference
for the later.  Changing it from "== 0" to "== NULL" is clearly a
valuable improvement.  Changing from "== 0" to "! " is a stylistic
change that should not be made lightly.
I personally often use and prefer the explicit comparison to NULL.
