The -aa patches are usually against the most recent 2.4 kernel (they are
usually only available against one specific kernel), IOW the following are
increasing version numbers:
2.4.18-aa1
2.4.18-pre8-aa1
2.4.19-pre9-aa1
2.4.19-pre9-aa2
2.4.19-rc1-aa1  (rc = "release candidate")
2.4.19-aa1
2.4.20-pre1-aa1
