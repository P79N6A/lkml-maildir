I think you're being too paranoid.  You pushed the performance degradation 
from the PIV to the PIII (because it will tend to hit more cachelines than it 
should) and you won't be able to build a kernel that is optimal for the PIII 
any more.  I'd say that is PIII kernel is *supposed* to suck to some degree 
when run on a PIV, otherwise why bother having the PIV option?
I expect the performance difference you're talking about is marginal anyway.  
Maybe you've measured it?
