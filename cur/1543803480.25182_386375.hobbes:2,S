No problems at this moment, except that the i8xx_tco driver doesn't 
seem to work on ICH6. Apparently Intel changed something after the 
ICH5 chipsets... Still need to look at that...
There is also a SuperMicro update that needs to go in for the 
i8xx_tco driver.
For the rest I have been working on the Berkshire PC-Watchdog ISA card.
Greetings,
Wim.
