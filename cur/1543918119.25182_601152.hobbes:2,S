Subject: get amount of "entropy" in /dev/random ?

From the userlevel, can I get an estimate of  "amount of entropy"
in /dev/random, that is, the estimate of number of bytes
readable until it blocks ? Of course multiple processes
can read bytes and this would not be exact ... but still .. as an upper
boundary estimate ?
Thanks
