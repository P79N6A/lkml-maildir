No, that simply checks tx status, the transmission is done elsewhere.

tx_interrupt is normally triggered on transmission completion, you 
probably want to sample from;
rtl8139_start_xmit {
...
	RTL_W32_F (TxStatus0 + (entry * sizeof (u32)),
		   tp->tx_flag | max(len, (unsigned int)ETH_ZLEN));
...
}
That is when the packet hits the hardware, you could keep per tx 
descriptor start/end timestamps with end being in tx_interrupt.
Hope that gets you somewhere.
