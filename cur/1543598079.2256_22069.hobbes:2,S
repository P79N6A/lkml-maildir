I was wrong. I must have made a mistake when I tried bzImage because now it
works.
Up to 2.2.20pre3 zImage works ok. After that it doesn't work any longer, but
bzImage does.
For example this is a 2.2.19 zImage
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root       476269 Aug 11 23:32 vmlinuz-2.2.19
which reports its size like this
Memory: 47136k/49152k available (832k kernel code, 412k reserved, 728k data, 44k init)
A 2.2.20pre9 built from the same .config doesn't boot from a zImage (tells
Out of memory) but boots up ok from a bzImage. Its size is the same as above:
Memory: 47136k/49152k available (832k kernel code, 412k reserved, 728k data, 44k init)
When I leave almost everything out of .config, I get this minimal kernel:
-rw-r--r--    1 kaukasoi users      261818 Aug 17 20:01 zImage
which reports this
Memory: 47612k/49152k available (428k kernel code, 412k reserved, 668k data, 32k init)
Even then zImage tells 'Out of memory' but bzImage boots up ok. So it seems
that zImages don't work any longer.
