Your argument applies to the SCO case because their code (if there is 
any, which nobody but SCO still believes is the case) did *not* have a 
license attached to it that didn't allow modification, redistribution or 
whatever else the GPL requires; otherwise they wouldn't have trouble 
demonstrating which code it is they're talking about. So any sane person 
would understand that they knowingly released it under the GPL: if 
they'll try to argue that they didn't know the kernel was covered by the 
GPL, I don't think the judge will go for much less than capital 
punishment when he stops laughing.
In this case, if I followed the discussion correctly, there are files 
and binary blobs in the kernel whose license explicitly disallows some 
of the freedoms the GPL grants. So they *have* to get out of the kernel 
proper *now*, period. There is no other choice, legally.
Once those files and stuff are out of the kernel, we can think of a 
solution that works from both a technical and a legal perspective, such 
as loading firmware from external files (which users will have to 
download themselves from vendors' sites -- we can't distribute them in 
any form if they don't change the license). Modules under a non-GPL 
license are a different can of worms: many people believe they are 
violating the GPL even if they remain outside of the kernel proper 
because they are obviously a derivative work of the kernel. So far AFAIK 
nobody sued NVidia, ATI or anyone else for distributing non-GPL modules, 
but they can _not_ stay in the kernel. I wonder how and why they were 
accepted in the first place.
