These calls show up in an strace which I did from a non-failing system,
but which has the same glibc as the failing system:
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 
0) = 0x40018000
old_mmap(NULL, 19184, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, 3, 0) = 0x40018000
The command was the following, with the result "Nothing to pull".
strace bk pull bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5
There were 52 instances of mmap2 or old_mmap in the saved script log.
