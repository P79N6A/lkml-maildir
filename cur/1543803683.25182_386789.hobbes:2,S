Hmm, it appears you are right.  I have never seen a non autosensing
gigabit port, so I thought it was part of the spec.  Given the pairs all
send and receive already it seemed like an obvious part to include in
the spec.
Certainly a cross over cable made for 10/100 mbit won't work.  It needs
the other two pairs swapped to.  Most store bought cross over cables
seem to only have 10/100mbit in mind when they were made.
Proper pinout appears to be:
1 <-> 3
2 <-> 6
4 <-> 7
5 <-> 8
