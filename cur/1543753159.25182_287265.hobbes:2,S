the flow of ioctl in kernel 2.6 .  it handles
for the generic implementations first and if not found then driver
specific (like BLKRRPART).
I am trying a pseudo driver over a block driver which will handle the
generic ioctls.
Is there a way I can handle BLKRRPART from my pseudo driver if I want to ?
Thanks & regards ,
