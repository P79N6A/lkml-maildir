Thanks for asking.  I'm rather surprised why nobody's noticing any of this 
slowdown.  To be fair, it's not really a regression, on the contrary, 2.4 is 
lot worse wrt swapin and swapout, and Rik van Riel even considers a 50% 
swapin slowdown wrt swapout something like better than expected (see thread 
'[RFC] kswapd: Kernel Swapper performance').  He probably meant random 
swapin, which seems to offer a 4x slowdown.
There are two ways to reproduce this:
1. swsusp to disk reports ~44mb/s swapout, and ~25mb/s swapin during resume
2. tmpfs swapout is superfast, whereas swapin is really slow
(see thread '[PATCH] free swap space when (re)activating page')
Here is an excerpt from that thread (note machine config in first line):
============================================
 RAM 512mb , SWAP 1G
 #mount -t tmpfs -o size=1G none /dev/shm
 #time cat /dev/full > /dev/shm/x.dmp
 15sec
 #time cat /dev/shm/x.dmp > /dev/null
 58sec
 #time cat /dev/shm/x.dmp > /dev/null
 72sec
 #time cat /dev/shm/x.dmp > /dev/null
 85sec
 #time cat /dev/shm/x.dmp > /dev/null
 93sec
 #time cat /dev/shm/x.dmp > /dev/null
 99sec
============================================
As you can see, swapout is running full wirespeed, whereas swapin not only is 
4x slower, but increasingly gets the VM tangled up to end at a ~6x slowdown.
So again, I'm really surprised people haven't noticed.
Thanks!
