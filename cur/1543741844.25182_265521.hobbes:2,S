I believe Gobo only has paths such as "/bin" for legacy compatibility
(for example scripts starting with #!/bin/...).  "/dev" is another
case, since that isn't where Gobo puts its devices, but lots of things
are going to assume they can use "/dev/zero" and "/dev/null".

Gobo actually does it in the kernel; whether that's better or worse
depends on your point of view.  There's a command-line tool "GoboHide"
that provides a list of hidden things:

I think all of the things hidden in a normal GoboLinux desktop are
just legacy symlinks, and the real locations they point to are fully
visible.  Unlike MacOS, where the Finder ignores a lot of real
directories and applications (I've been bitten there by "/tmp"
myself).
