Ok, first off I'd like to say, I am on 2.6.12-rc3-mm2, and this issue
is not fixed at all.  Secondly, I'd like to say that I've pinpointed
it a bit more.  It appears only Empty partitions (type 0 in fdisk) do
not create device nodes.
Here is the partition table from fdisk, fdisk does run fine.. its just
the fact this node is not created that threw me off before.
   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sdb1   *           1           2       16033+   0  Empty
/dev/sdb2   *           6        2431    19486845    b  W95 FAT32
/dev/sdb3               3           5       24097+  83  Linux
Notice, /dev/sdb1 is a Empty partition... in /dev I only have sdb,
sdb2, and sdb3.  No sdb1.  Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Joe
