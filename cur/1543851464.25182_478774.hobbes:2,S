I'm OK with that change. You could have submitted the IEEE 1394 part
separately though.
A comment on the patch description: Only the eth1394 driver and the
ieee1394 core driver depend directly on NET. (All other FireWire drivers
depend on ieee1394 of course.) ieee1394's dependency on NET is planned
to be removed by a minor change to its implementation but we don't have
a deadline for this, as usual...
