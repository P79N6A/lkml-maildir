Yes _without_ -test it's stable, with -test it its still testing...

It did not break anything but historic dysfunctional - I know 
because I tested several releases between 2.5.6x and 2.6-test1.

You look at it very black and white. If you like to insist, please 
consider the recall of a tire on some SUV which kept on flipping over
as an example of fixing something in a less than ideal manner. If it
is broken, it must be fixed to protect and satisfy.
Of course, I remember that some people say it wasn't the tire but the 
suspension being too hard which resulted in recommending low-inflation
of the tire. This turned out to be under-inflation in practice, leading 
to the tire to fail due to mechanical over-stress and over-heating... 
Poor tire - other tyres survive this kind of abuse by the typical 
consumer every day. ;)
