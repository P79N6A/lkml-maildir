   A legal perspective.
We have no interest in sending the FBI to go knock down someones
doors, just removing the offending address and fixing the problem,
thats all.
I used to live in New Jersey, where "run out and sue your brother and
neighbour just because you can" was considered quite cool.  I don't
see things that way any more, in fact I think it's kind of lame.
But thanks for your legal perspective anyways. :-)
