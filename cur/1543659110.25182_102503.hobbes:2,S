it has to be fixed for 2.6, no argument.
I took a look at it. I think the easiest strategy would be:
- Make sure all the process context code holds BKL
(most of it does, but not all - sometimes it is buggy like in 
disassociate_tty) 
I have some patches for that for tty_io.c at least
The local_irq_save in there are buggy, they need to take 
a lock.
- Audit the data structures that are touched by interrupts
and add spinlocks.
At least for n_tty.c probably just tty->read_lock needs to be 
extended.
Perhaps some can be just "fixed" by ignoring latency and pushing
softirq functions into keventd
(modern CPUs should be fast enough for that) 
- Possibly disable module unloading for ldiscs (seems to be rather broken,
although Rusty's new unload algorithm may avoid the worst - not completely
sure)
Probably all doable with some concentrated effort.
Anyone interested in helping ?
