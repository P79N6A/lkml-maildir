Sorry, the bug is caused by the returning line:
        return slot;
It should be
        return &slot;
The patch originally applies to
                        void *radix_tree_lookup()
But in -mm the function turns into
                        void **__lookup_slot()
And in my radixtree patch, it is
                        void *radix_tree_lookup_node()
The prototypes changed forth and back, so the problem was never discovered.
