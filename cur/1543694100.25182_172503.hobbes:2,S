I don't think you are aware that the kernel is compressed,
then expanded when installed. It therefore has all the good
attributes of a `tar.gz` file without any of the bad ones.
Also, we have a module loader and unloader that allows modules
to be inserted and removed from a running system. There are
even experimental systems that allow the whole kernel to be
changed without (apparent) re-booting.
A file with a 'tar' header is useful for recovering a
directory tree, intact, as it was initially backed-up.
It has no usefulness in the kernel where the content
of a file (or files) are located into various offsets
in RAM. This is done by the linker and 'helper code'
within the kernel itself.
You can readily run an install-system without any
runtime libraries and/or you can use temporary ones.
This is currently done for every major distribution.
The runtime libraries are not used by the kernel.
Instead they are used by user-mode code.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
