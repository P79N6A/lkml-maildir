Well, in this case HAL behaviour makes sense (default to present == true 
if "present" attribute is missing)

At least looking in ACPI specs, this looks possible. What currently is 
presented as battery object is actually battery bay according to ACPI spec:
Unlike most other devices, when a battery is inserted or removed from the 
system, the device itself (the
battery bay) is still considered to be present in the system.
When battery is inserted/removed, ACPI notifies us and we can check whether 
battery is actually present and update registration accordingly. From the 
sysfs structure POV probably nothing has to be changed; just when and how 
power_supply is registered 
under /sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/device:00/PNP0C0A:0n
Alexey, does it make sense (or doable)?
