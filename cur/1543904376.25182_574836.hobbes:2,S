Hi Ingo,
[ Going off-topic, nothing related to swap/prefetch/etc. Just getting
a hang of how development goes on here ... ]

It's not so easy or clear-cut, see below.

Of course -- that's a given.

This itself may require some "convincing" to do. What if the maintainer
just doesn't recognize the problem? Note that the development model
here is more about the "social" thing than purely a "technical" thing.
People do handwave, possibly due to innocent misunderstandings,
possibly without. Often it's just a case of seeing different reasons behind
the "problematic behaviour". Or it could be a case of all of the above.

Oh yes -- that'll be helpful, but definitely not necessarily a prerequisite
for all issues, and then you can't even expect everybody to write or
test/benchmark with testcases. (oh, btw, this is assuming you do find
consensus on a testcase)

Umm ... well. Should this "dance-with-the-maintainer" and all be really
necessary? What you're saying is easy if a "bug" is simple and objective,
with mathematically few (probably just one) possible correct solutions.
Often (most often, in fact) it's a subjective issue -- could be about APIs,
high level design, tradeoffs, even little implementation nits ... with one
person wanting to do it one way, another thinks there's something hacky
or "band-aidy" about it and a more beautiful/elegant solution exists elsewhere.
I think there's a similar deadlock here (?)

Oh yes. But why "optionally"? This is *precisely* what the spirit of
development in such open / distributed projects is ... unless Linux
wants to die the same, slow, ivory-towered, miserable death that
*BSD have.

Umm, ok ... pretty unlikely Linus or Andrew would take patches for any
kernel subsystem (that isn't obvious/trivial) from anybody just like that,
so you do need to Cc: the ones they trust (maintainer) to ensure they
review/ack your work and pick it up.

Agreed. That's definitely not the way to go.

Umm, well this could depend from problem-to-problem.

Again, agreed -- but people can plausibly see different root causes for
the same symptoms -- and different solutions.

That's the whole point. For non-trivial / non-obvious / subjective issues,
the "process" you laid out above could itself become a problem ...
