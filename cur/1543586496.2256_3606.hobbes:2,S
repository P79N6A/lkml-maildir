Yes, that fixes it. Issuing the first fbset command brings me back 
some sort of display, all fsck'ed up but vaguely readable with 
shimmering bits of text all over it in the wrong places. The second 
fbset gets it back correctly at the right resolution and right refresh
rate. Thanks, a workaround at least.
