It's a decoded version of one of the CPU registers that describes the
ordering model of the memory.  The K6-2 / K6-3 have iirc 3 different
settings here, weak, notsoweak, strong. Weak ordering is faster, but
may show up strange bugs. Which after Andrea pointed out that the
function in the oops was unlikely to erm, oops, I got wondering if
perhaps your BIOS had programmed it too aggressively.
But, this was just a random thought that didn't prove right, so
back to the drawing board.. 8-)
