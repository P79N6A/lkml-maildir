Hi,
I've uploaded my latest lockless pagecache patch for 2.6.17-rc6.
This includes a couple of fixes for lockless radix-tree bugs that
we think the ScaleMP guys ran into (unconfirmed, but they do fix
real bugs). The issue was just that some of the gang lookups
were using the unsafe root->height rather than the lock-free-safe
node->height fields.

Thanks,
Nick
