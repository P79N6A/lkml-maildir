Ok, I'll try to avoid touching that code. In a perfect world, we should
have proper handlers for those firmware interrupts anyway, it's just
that the "spec" says we should call the firmware for any interrupt we
don't handle...
I suppose it should be enough for us to test for desc->action before
calling __do_IRQ() and eventually do the firmware trick then, since I
doubt that if it matters at all, it will happen on shared interrupts...
Ben.
