The list has been created: linux-future@nl.linux.org, if
you want to subscribe to it, please send a message to:
majordomo@nl.linux.org 
	with a body of "subscribe linux-future"
(yes, there were people who got this wrong)
And yes, one of the purposes of this list is to take some
of the load off of linux-kernel. It seems to work rather
well since it's already got 34 subscribers in the first
5 hours of existance...
So, if you've got something offtopic: take it to the other
list!
