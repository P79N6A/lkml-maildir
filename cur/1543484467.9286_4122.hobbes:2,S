I think the answer to a lot of these 'why ...' questions is: because
the system has evolved slowly over a long period of time.  And at each
step of evolution, it continues to be compatible with the tools and
expectations of the user base.
I could ask: 'why does make modules-install sprinkle the modules in
a bunch of target directories with semi-irregular names, with
occassional collisions like misc/pt.o'.  But I've found it's more
productive to ask 'would anyone like to try this patch, it makes
modules-install simpler and cleaner' (sorry I don't have a separate
patch at this time but it's in the Dancing Makefiles).
