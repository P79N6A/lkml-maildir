Most people don't check the source of every program they run - not even
as root. An algorithm that will never kill processes running as root
will be a big problem in the (rare) cases when root processes go crazy.
It's better to kill the processes that actually tries to allocate
memory. (and the page-fault approach sounds even better)

telnetd runs as root no matter who is telneting in. With this approach,
anyone can kill every process running as non-root by making a lot of
telnet-connections. Not good.
