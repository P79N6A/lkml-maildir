The problem is the buffercache/blkdev-pagecache: it simply can't go in
highmem. A similar fix happened recently in 2.6 for the same reasons,
but in 2.6 we allowed it with some logic specific for the
blkdev-pagecache.
nr_free_buffer_pages() was never intended to take highmem into account,
that's why there's the GFP_USER thing already, except we didn't loop
into the zonelist, so I didn't try to make a fix similar to 2.6.
