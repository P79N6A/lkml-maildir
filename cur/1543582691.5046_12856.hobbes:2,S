memcpy() isn't exactly trivial, especially not when we're talking about
disk storage.  Note, too, that we're talking about storage in a
filesystem, and random access a large, growable linear space (i.e. a
file) in a filesystem is O(log n) because of necessary inode indirection.
That's yet another reason I like the idea of using B-trees over hash
values: B-trees are O(log n), but do not need the file inode indirection
to do the job, so what you end up with is very nice and fast.
