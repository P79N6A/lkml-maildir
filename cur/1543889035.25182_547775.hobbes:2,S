Just to be clear, it's fsck that complains:
Checking filesystems  
Checking all file systems.  
[/sbin/fsck.ext3 (1) -- /] fsck.ext3 -a /dev/dasda1   
fsck.ext3: No such device or address while trying to open /dev/dasda1   
Possibly non-existent or swap device?  
[FAILED]   
(so that is after udev has been started and obviously dasda1 could be
accessed)

I currently have the inkling that
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    0 May 22 15:59 block:dasda1-> ../../../class/block/dasda1
in /sys/block/dasda/ is the culprit. In all other versions I've tried
(without CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED, and on an older kernel with and
without CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED), it's always dasda1.
I can continue investigating tomorrow, unless someone has a good idea :)
