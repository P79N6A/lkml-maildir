Exactly the same problems here, on a laptop (Amd64, Mandriva 2006, 
linux-2.6.15) with an:
ALi Corporation M5229 IDE (rev c7)
The cd-writer locks up if the DMA is enabled, as above. But the drive is 
usable if it is disabled.
The only other potential problem I've found is that the UDMA timings for 
the /dev/hda is "???" (see below).

The same situation here. I've seen a few reports about this behaviour 
with the alim15x3 driver before, so I just wanted to report my problems 
too. If someone has any idea what's happening I'd be glad to try out any 
patches. Please CC me, as I am not subscribed to the list.
