Yup.

Most projects inform vendors with enough heads-up time to let them get
their stuff together and out the door.

No, that's pretty similar to CVE allocation.  At one time, there was
little effort even put into allocating CVE entries for local DoS holes.
It's not that they aren't important, but less critical than remote DoS
issues, and way less so than anything priv escalation related.
