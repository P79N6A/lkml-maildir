After four days of running, the EM64T has at last reproduced the same
hang as it did in an hour before: stuck in ext2_try_to_allocate_with_rsv,
repeatedly ext2_rsv_window_add, ext2_try_to_allocate, rsv_window_remove
(perhaps not in that order).
But somehow I've screwed up, and before I'd extracted any new info,
kdb was spinning on its own kdb_printf_lock, and then the box completely
frozen: nothing for it but to reboot.
Grrrr.
Well: at least this resolves the doubt I raised earlier, whether
I'd been testing with the right ext2 patch.  This time was definitely
with your patch not my two-liner: your original patch from Tuesday 14 Nov,
ext2-reservations-bring-ext2-reservations-code-in-line-with-latest-ext3-fix
Various other patches have come into -mm (one gone) since then, but I've
been running just with that: so far as I can see, none of the later ones
should be important in my case - the filesystem is too small for the
difference between int and ext2_fsblk_t to become important, and
neither "ld" nor "as" (the writer this time) does MAP_SHARED pageout.
I'll do a little staring at the code myself: I'm unlikely to notice
anything you've missed, but there's just a chance staring at it will
direct me to some detail I've jotted down from before.
