Eric/Peter,
How about just extending bzImage format to include some info in real mode
kernel header. Say protocol version 2.05. I think if we just include two
more fields, is kernel relocatable and equivalent of ELF memsz, then probably
this information should be enough for kexec bzImage loader to load and run
a relocatable kernel from a different address.
Thanks
Vivek
