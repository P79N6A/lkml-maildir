We did not want to create a hotspot around time sources for HRT and the
scheduler clock, and there really hasn't been enough analyis.
The loop should be calibrated using something similar to
loops_per_jiffy, and it should be in nanoseconds.
It needs to be tunable, because it depends a lot on the workload.
High frequency periodic tasks would need a lower setting - but it also
relates to the number of waiting tasks and the number of CPUs, so there
may be heuristics that tie into lockstat.
For big-SMP systems, it may actually be worth the overhead to track
these stats per-lock (for the hot locks), if we can correlate it all to
performance.

The code actually runs preemptibly, so even before the timeout expires,
the task can pop off the CPU (at which point another state chance
cancels the loop)

True - I looked at something generic, similar to what RT's latency
tracing uses, allowing for other architectures.
