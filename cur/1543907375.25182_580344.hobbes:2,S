I'm not sure I understand your question?  What do you mean by 
"accessible"?  The intention is to _just_ reserve the addr/port.  
The socket struct alloc and bind was a simple way to do this.  I 
assume we'll have to come up with a better way though.  
Namely provide a low level interface to the port space allocator 
allowing both rdma and the host tcp stack to share the space without
requiring a socket struct for rdma connections. 
Or maybe we'll come up a different and better solution to this issue...
Steve.
