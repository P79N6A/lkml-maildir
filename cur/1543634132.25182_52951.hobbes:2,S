Note that the CPU time remained constant.  The wall time went up.
You did more seeking with the dual-thread approach.
I rather depends on what is in /tmp/filelist.  I assume it's
something like the output of `find'.  And I assume you're
using ext2 or ext3?
- ext2/3 will chop the filesystem up into 128-megabyte block groups.
- It attemts to place all the files in a directory into the same
  block group.
- It will explicitly place new directories into a different blockgroup
  from their parent.
And I suspect it's the latter point which has caught you out.  You have
two threads, and probably each thread's list of 100 files is from a
different directory.  And hence it lives in a different block group.
And hence your two threads are competing for the disk head.
Even increasing the elevator read latency won't help you here - we don't
perform inter-file readahead, so as soon as thread 1 blocks on a read,
it has *no* reads queued up and the other thread's requests are then 
serviced.
You'll get best throughput with a single read thread.  There are some
smarter readahead things we could do in there, but it tends to be
that device-level readahead fixes everything up anyway.
