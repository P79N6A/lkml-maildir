Do you mean you have the code already? If it is so, could you please
provide a patch Dmitry and I can give a try to?
If not, I am willing to give it a try, if you provide some guidance. I
think I understand that platform_device_del would be the first half of
platform_device_unregister, but do we then want to rebuild
platform_device_unregister on top of platform_device_del so as to avoid
code duplication, or not?
Thanks,
