I'll try it all.
I don't know if this is related, but my notebook keyboard doesn't emit
numbers with numlock (not even directly Fn+blue number) anymore with
-rc3 (note that LED is flashing when numlock is on). I think -rc2
worked fine (I'm going to check this too). It's Asus M6R, similar
(except wi-fi) to for example yenya's model here:
