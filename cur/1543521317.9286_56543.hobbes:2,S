   I did this patch some time ago. It would be better to kill the
   global cli/sti so fixing the races properly, but I don't have such
   hardware to test the code I am not going to do that. The fixes
   below only fixes the current races. It applyed cleanly to 2.3.36.
I've applied your patches, thanks.
