Adeos is a faily simple code, only aimed at creating the "pipeline" 
abstraction, which is used to dispatch incoming events to the RT 
extension (which provides the co-scheduler) and Linux, according to 
their respective priorities. I'm going to build a stripped down version 
of the Adeos/x86 patch to only keep the core implementation of the 
interrupt pipeline and post it here asap, so that we could further 
discuss on actual code.
