Hello,
Just installed a SB PCI64 card with an es1370 chip as modules, and
recording/mixing works OK, but i'm unable to play sound for some reason.
a `cat file >/dev/dsp` just waits and waits (doesn't work correctly i read
in the docs but i didn't expect such a thing)
Same result with vplay and mpg123, and i noticed the interrupts keep
hangin on zero while trying to play sound, with recording interrupts are
generated.
I tried also the es1371 module to load without succes (i'm pretty sure it
is an 1370 chip)
Relevant info:
* Kernel 2.2.2-ac3, (2.2.2 didn't compile, but i expect it would do the
  same since there is no es1370 code in the ac3 patch)

(I use one config for 2 machines, that's why the SB16 etc is compiled too)
Ideas? Should i load additional modules, perhaps use some mudule options?
Thanks!

Argh!  All right, so how am I supposed to work with Linux when
everything's already been done?!  Can't these people leave some
broken MSDOS like parts so there's problems left to solve!?....
