Please don't -- Ivan has a patch for this, let's get that in instead.
We all acknowledge your patch is a workaround, but this sort of fix does
not belong in the mainstream kernel.  We want to fix it The Right
Way(tm), once.  And since a patch already exists for this...
We need to get IvanK's extended-save-restore-state patch in, too.
Ivan, would you be up for a repost on lkml?
