mmap works -- you just can't do MAP_PRIVATE.  Everything has to be
MAP_SHARED.  There is no fork (though vfork works).  brk doesn't work,
and things like iopl, ioperm are pointless.  etc...
Oh, and when you do malloc something (malloc is mmap based) you
really want to remember to free it, since the system can't clean
up after you,
