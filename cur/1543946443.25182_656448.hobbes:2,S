It's not quite the maximum anymore, is it? More like the minumum
maximum ;). A better name might better document what the test is
actually trying to do.
One question I have is whether the unpatched test is still valuable.
Based on my limited knowledge of the test I suspect it's still a correct
test of message queues. If so, perhaps renaming the old test (so it's
not confused with a performance regression) and adding your patched
version is best?
