In at least 99% of the cases this is OK and the check has found
several bugs where things would not have worked due to different
alignmnet between kernel and userland. Just think about the
issues in a mixed 32/64 bit world.
In this particular case you _could_ be right that it would work
on ARM userland. But the only way to be sure is to pad the
structure so it become 8 byte in size.
Or as was recently done in the m68k case to tell the
compiler to specifically align it to 8 byte boundary.
