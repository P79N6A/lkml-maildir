Calling userspace function from inside kernel (still) possible?
Yes it is.
I wrote a small generic module that sends a SIGCONT signal to a
registered user space process upon an event in the Kernel. The user
space program has to open the /dev/my_generic_module entry point and
provide it its pid number through an ioctl call. Then, the user space
program needs an handler for the SIGCONT (or whatever signal) and goes
into pause() and waits for a signal. Upon a given event in the
Kernel. the module sends a signal to the process with kill_proc(pid,
signal, 0).
In my case, the Kernel event is simply a function of my module being
scheduled every jiffy.  This way of doing is fairly simple and you
don't have to play with any other parts of the Kernel. There are
probably other ways (and probably better) of doing this, but this
works well.
