I'm quite aware of the date and time, thank you. The 'i386 architecture
is the Intel-like stuff that doesn't have all the newer gee-whiz
things that are of little value in the embedded area.
And, ARM is an exploded-cost over-hyped RISC device with poor I/O
capability that assumes that the world is interfaced in 32-bit
chunks. It also can't take advantage of the cost economies that
you get from the devices used in the PC mass-market like
memory-controllers, PCI-IO bridges and etc.
Although these are used in the new "high-definition" TVs I
can assure you that there are many more PC components being
manufactured now than high-definition TV sets. Eventually,
the ARM, or something that supersedes it might make sense.
Right not, forget it.
So, basically, you guys think you can single-handedly
remove Linux from the embedded market and re-do it just
for servers? Or are you going to leave some capability
for desk-tops, too?
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
