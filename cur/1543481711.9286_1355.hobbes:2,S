It's also possible that Linus may choose to use neither, and write his own. =)
But, regardless of what happens, the brainstorming process itself brought out a
lot of good ideas and helped in polishing the two release candidates.  A big
"thank you" to everyone who helped out.
Okay...while we're waiting, we might as well handle the problem that Ed brought
up on his site: that of distribution.  We should probably divide up the (Linux
and mainstream) news organizations into groups each manned by a distributor;
then, have each distributor find a way to reliably transmit the release to his
group of sites.  Eventually, the news will get around anyhow, but a coordinated
effort definitely has its advantages.
There's also another problem: who wants to be the contact for the release?  I
wouldn't presume to speak for Linus, but from the sound of his last email,
I think the last thing he wants is to get flooded with *more* email.
Volunteers...?  Should we have multiple contacts, i.e., each distributor is the
contact for his group?
