This would also be useful for the OLPC project - it's unlikely that 
it'll use ACPI, but a more feature-rich interface than /proc/apm would 
be massively helpful. This is just a matter of speccing out what 
information is needed and what format it should be presented in, and 
then adding a new device class, right?
