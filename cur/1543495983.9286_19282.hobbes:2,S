  The only problem I have with that, is that msg_name=NULL was used in
some my program to indicate that there is no name, and it worked fine on
Linux 2.0.x, Solaris 2.x, FreeBSD 2.x-3.1, AIX 4.x and some others. Since
there was nothing about it in the standards, I assumed that it works in
more or less "natural" way ("NULL means nothing, but the size of
*possible* address can be nonzero, just like NULL can be assigned to the
pointer that is not void"). Even though there was neither memory
corruption, nor failed malloc() in my program, it was broken badly --
communication between two processes stopped working, and instead one
process was constantly getting errors from sendmsg() and going to the next
loop (it was a usual model with nonblocking communication in
select()/poll() loop). Program didn't check for EINVAL with known to be
valid arguments, so it wasn't even detectable without tracing.
  I'm afraid that I was not the only person who did the same thing, and
what was supposed to catch application bugs, caught my possibly wrong but
justifiable guess.

  Maybe for consistency sake, sendmsg() can be made to match this?
