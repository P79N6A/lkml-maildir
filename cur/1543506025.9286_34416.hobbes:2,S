OK, sounds much more reasonable!

It is maintained but not adhered to.

Yes.  Dynamic upper and lower RSS bounds have _lots_ of advantages.  A
lower bound lets tasks like login make progress even during heavy
memory pressure, and making the limit dynamic still allows us to swap
out those logins once they become idle.  An upper dynamic bound lets
you perform swapout on a large memory-bound task without overloading
the entire memory system for other tasks.  
Just as importantly, these limits would give us a mechanism by which
to track the page fault rates for different tasks and to
preferentially swap out specific tasks in response.
