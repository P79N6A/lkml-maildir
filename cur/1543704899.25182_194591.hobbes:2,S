This is spec as hpa saied. So this is right things, and other fat
driver also does, AFAIK.

Thanks.

The above should "goto EODir;". Likewise, another "contiure" of
fat_search_long().

mark_inode_dirty(dir) is not needed, instead of it we should do
mark_buffer_dirty(bh).
And this fat_get_entry() updates bh and de, but it should be point to
allocated bh and de, not free entry. It's needed by msdos_add_entry().
Thanks.
