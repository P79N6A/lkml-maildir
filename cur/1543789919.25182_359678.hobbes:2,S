  At least the problem showed up, so the load on the power supply is not 
a prime concern.
  If you have the patience, first take out one of the 'good' sticks and 
repeat with 2x1GB.  If that works, it's probable the mobo can't drive 
3x1GB, at least with the chip arrangement on those particular sticks. 
OTOH, if it still fails at that address, perhaps that one stick is 
suspect - in that case try swapping it and retesting.
  Of course, if your manual is unclear about which slot maps where, you 
might have to try permutations of 2 sticks on this approach.  And that's 
before messing with obscure and poorly-explained bios options to control 
the memory timing and drive.  Good Luck!
