  Doesn't matter if it is root-only. Ask the admin about the specific
  plugin the user wants. For most other users they can su to root and
  do this on their own computers. Not everyone is using Linux is a
  corporate world.

  That just doesn't do it. I doubt there will be an option to save
  encrypted Word and Excel files and be able to open them in Abiword,
  StarOffice or OpenOffice unless the decryption/encryption is done on
  a lower level.
  Also, eventually there may be a userland interface for loading
  certain modules without root access.?

  To me there are fine and good uses for plugins. Everyone seem to
  think different though.
  Sure many things can perhaps be done by linking and piping lots of
  programs, just to access some data. But that certainly is far from
  user friendly.
