I was running my VLAN test, which creates 4000 VLAN interfaces,
sets their IP/mask, and then later tears them down...
However, my box is seeing 300 processes running and a load
of around 47.00.  Most of these processes are 'ifconfig'
and net.agent.  I am not running ifconfig in my script, so
I assume net.agent is.  Needless to say, my test is running
real slow...
I am wondering if this is a RH only thing, or if it is found
across all 2.4 distributions...
Thanks,
Ben
