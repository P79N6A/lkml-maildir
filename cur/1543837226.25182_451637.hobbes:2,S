I just did something like that:
Similar to 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.18-rc3/2.6.18-rc3-mm2/broken-out/add-probe_kernel_address.patch
Although I'm not sure it's needed for this problem. A getppid() which does
asmlinkage long sys_getppid(void)
{
	int pid;
	read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
	pid = current->group_leader->real_parent->tgid;
	read_unlock(&tasklist_lock);
	return pid;
}
seems like a fine implementation to me ;)
