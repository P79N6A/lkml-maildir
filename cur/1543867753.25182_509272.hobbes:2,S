Actually, the version of DualFS for Linux 2.4.19 implements a cleaner. In 
our case, the cleaner is not really a problem because there is not too 
much to clean (the meta-data device only contains meta-data blocks which 
are 5-6% of the file system blocks; you do not have to move data blocks).
Anyway, thank you for warning me ;-)
Regards,
 	Juan.
