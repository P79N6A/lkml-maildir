Personally, I'd sooner see the mount(8) command accept the timezone
name and perform the translation, simply because of the fact that
different countries have different interpretations of - and + when it
comes to specifying timezone offsets - some specify the offset as
local - GMT and others as GMT - local !!!
However, the actual timezone name would be meaningless in the kernel.

If it was, that would be part of the internal logic of the mount(8)
command, and not part of the kernel itself. Memory says that the
"-o remount" option only tweaks existing values, so if it said...
	mount -o remount,tz=MDT /win95
...then yes, it would be expected to tweak the partition's time offset
field, but if it didn't include such an option, it would have no
reason to do so.
As far as the driver is concerned, it would work as follows:
 1. When a stat() call arrives for a file, it looks up the
    file's details and fills in the stat() structure, then
    tweaks the time fields in that structure by subtracting
    the stored offset from each one.
 2. When it has reason to update a time on the FAT partition,
    it tweaks the stored time by adding the stored offset to
    the value to be stored.
This basically implies that as far as the rest of the kernel is
concerned, the driver always uses and provides GMT, which I believe to
be the assumption that's made at the moment by the rest of the kernel.
It's just that at the moment, the said assumption is flawed.
As far as the driver is concerned, it is handling a drive that stores
times based on whatever time offset the relevant field has when it
writes the file, and the tweaks to implement that shouldnae be hard.
Lemme have a look...

There are reasons other than running MacroHard's OS's on that machine
for using FAT based file systems on floppies, one obvious one being
that the format is common to many different operating systems. As an
example, if I wish to download any large files, I take one or two VFAT
formatted Zip-100's into the local university and download over their
internet links. Since their systems don't run Linux (they dual-boot
either WinNT or Solaris), VFAT makes the best choice.
Best wishes from Riley.
