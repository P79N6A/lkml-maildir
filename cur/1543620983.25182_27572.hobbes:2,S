subterfugue.sf.net can do this. It has ready-to-use timeshift/timemultiply
module.

Why do you need kernel module at all?
BTW syscall rewriting is pretty hard (subterfugue solves that, but it definitely
took more than a day.
Imagine open('/foo/bar')
you rewrite it to open('/funny/bar')
then another thread comes and rewrites it back to '/foo/bar'.
Or imagine open(address in read-only memory).
