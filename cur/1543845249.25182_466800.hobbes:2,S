Right. avr32-implement-kernel_execve.patch, which was flagged as "Will
merge" by Andrew, fixes it by moving the #ifdef __KERNEL__ guard to
cover everything but the __NR_foo definitions. So as long as that
one's still scheduled for inclusion, I think sending a separate patch
to fix this problem will do more harm than good.
But thanks for testing :)
