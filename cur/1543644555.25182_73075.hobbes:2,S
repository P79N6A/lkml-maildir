Bah, who needs define a problem when you have a sexy solution...

I don't see why we need a "make templates" at all in the kernel tarball. 
  This can be totally external to the kernel and still work fine.

If they are compiled into the kernel and modules, this is not needed in 
the kernel tarball either.
It should be straightforward to [re-]generate templates on boot, much 
like module dependencies are [re-]computed on boot when necessary.

doh!  I missed that.  That "no good" example is in use in the kernel 
today, implying that this new API reduces functionality...
