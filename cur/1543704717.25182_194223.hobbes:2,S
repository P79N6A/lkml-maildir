I'm surprised the sense messages don't show that it's a write to a write
protected disc (xx/27/zz, where xx == 0x07 or 0x05). However, it's even
more annoying to _not_ be able to write to a media because the kernel
thinks it knows better. In your fsck case you sort of get what you ask
for, by shooting yourself in the foot :)

Yes please.

Nitpick: sectors_per_frame = queue_hardsect_size(q) >> 9;
That's about, the rest looks fine.
