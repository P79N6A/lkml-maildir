I suspect everything :) It was also a polite way saying (on a completely
configured, etc kernel):
	% make fs/ntfs/inode.S
	make: *** No rule to make target `fs/ntfs/inode.S'.  Stop.
Anyway, considering how bogus the oops was and Randy already had two
oops'es before this NTFS one, I think the NTFS driver was a sufferer
of other trouble(s) than the originator. So unless one can reproduce
something close to this one (or Randy sends his first [two] oops), I
would just trash
