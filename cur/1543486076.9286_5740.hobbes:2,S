However, it defers to the definition of rmdir(2) in Posix 1003.1 for 
conditions and errors.

Both Posix 1003.2 and the Single Unix Specification state
that many commands are implemented in terms of an interface and all restrictions
of the interface apply, XPG4.2 goes on to state:
	(XCU4.2, p. 11)
	... The treatment of errors and intermediate results from 
        the individual functions cited are generally not specified by
        this document. 
	(XCU4.2, p. 615 (rmdir(1)))
	SEE ALSO:
		rm in XCU
		remove(), rmdir() and unlink() in XSH
XCU (commands and utilities) defers to XSH (System Interfaces
and Headers) where appropriate, such as rmdir, and both XSH and
XCU are derived from Posix (posix can be considered a proper 
subset of the SUS/XPG/XSH,XCU,XBD) [see XCU4.2 p 7, section 1.6].

(btw:  Posix also states that opendir(".") after rmdir(".") 
shall fail with ENOENT).
