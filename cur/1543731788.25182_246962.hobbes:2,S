Haruo,
I am not using the combine mode on the sata drives (or at least, I don't 
know about it). I was implying that
when I connect another pure IDE drive to the motherboard, then the 
situation gets better.
Whats wrong here (or ... what feels wrong) is that the system slows down 
noticeably when transferring data
to/from the sata drives. It 'feels' like using an old ide disk with pio 
mode only. I am not saying that the transfer rates
are low though... hdparm -t on the sata drives gives me following:
/dev/sda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  140 MB in  3.01 seconds =  46.46 MB/sec
/dev/sdb:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  164 MB in  3.00 seconds =  54.60 MB/sec
this is not the best, but I think it is acceptable for SATA/PATA drives 
and onboard SATA controller.
It is quite hard to describe what is going wrong here... It might not be 
even related to the sata itself...
One example of the 'slow' system is that when I run 'top -d 1' (top with 
1 second updates), it sometimes
takes ~4 seconds for the screen to update when the disk io is on action.
(on dual processor opteron x86_64 machine :-) .Kernel vanilla 2.6.8.
Best Regards,
Petr
