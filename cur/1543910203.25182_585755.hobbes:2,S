Hello everyone,
I am trying to port kernel 2.6.19 onto my system.so I need the c code
, which can show me where the program is running. I add -g when I
compile it.
after I got the vmlinux( uncompressed) I used arm-none-eabi-objcopy
--change-addresses 0x40000000 to change the start address.
it seems that the debug information is strange. expecially after the
mmu is turned on , it totally disappreared.
anyone knows how to handle this?
thanks in advance.
regards,
yang
