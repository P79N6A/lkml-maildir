Thanks Nick - seems exemplary so far.  No stuttering or swap thrashing 
under the time-honoured UT2004 test, even with some phat desktop apps 
sitting in memory.
I'm still running on 2.6.9-ck1 for now.  Is there anything else you want 
me to try?  Presumably VM scanning work is ongoing for 2.6.10?  I might 
give -rc1 a spin, just for fun....
Cheers
Alastair
