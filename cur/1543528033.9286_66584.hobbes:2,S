Ingo,
I just changed the mapping for the MPU-401 interrupt to IRQ 10.
So far the only system instability I've noticed was a XFree86
3.9.18 crash last night.  When I looked at dmesg, there were 
two new messages at the end:
	spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7
	keyboard: Timeout - AT keyboard not present?
