Pat, you can ignore moving those patches.  I cannot get anywhere close to
a kernel that builds with this.  The first problem I ran into was
a missing arch/ia64/sn/ioif/agp subdir.  I made a patch to ignore that
subdir and am now running into missing .h files.  I am going exploring
for a workarea to see what your tree looks like.
Thanks,
Robin
