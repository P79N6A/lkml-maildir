Is that psets?  If so, no thanks.
I want a simple, clean, quick implementation.  I have seen patches that
do a lot more than what my simple implementation does, and that really
does not interest me and I suspect Ingo and others feel the same way. 
Setting a simple per-task bitmask that is inherited is all we need.
Linux scheduler API is already our own standard.  I'd rather support
that (i.e. add another simple sched_* call) than some evil other
interface - but that is just me.
