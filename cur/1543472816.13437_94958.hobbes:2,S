Hello,
   In 2.1.132 I've found the following patch:
@@ -39,6 +40,9 @@
 if [ "$CONFIG_PCI" = "y" ]; then
   bool '   PCI BIOS support' CONFIG_PCI_BIOS
   bool '   PCI direct access support' CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT
+  if [ "$CONFIG_PCI_BIOS" = "n" -a "$CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT" = "n" ]; then
+    define_bool CONFIG_PCI_BIOS "y"
+  fi
   bool '   PCI quirks' CONFIG_PCI_QUIRKS
   if [ "$CONFIG_PCI_QUIRKS" = "y" -a "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" = "y" ]; then
     bool '   PCI bridge optimization (experimental)' CONFIG_PCI_OPTIMIZE
   I think we should not silently assume we should use the PCI BIOS if the
user has selected neither PCI BIOS nor PCI direct access. If neither
is selected, the PCI driver just refuses to compile and tells the user
he should configure it properly.
				Have a nice fortnight
