I don't want to just send a patch, I want you to understand why your 
approach is wrong.

The correction is incorrect for NO_HZ.
Let's try it the other way around, as my explanation seem to lack 
something.
Please try to explain what this correction actually means and why it 
should be correct for NO_HZ as well.

Above is the key to understanding the problem, if this difference is small 
enough there is no need to correct anything.
This is the original patch which introduced the correction:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/old-2.6-bkcvs.git;a=commitdiff;h=69c1cd9218e4cf3016b0f435d6ef3dffb5a53860
Keep in mind that at that time PIT was used as the base clock (even if the 
tsc was used, it was relative to PIT). So how much of those assumptions 
are still valid today (especially with NO_HZ enabled)?
