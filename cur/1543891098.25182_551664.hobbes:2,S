Interesting but impossible to do for ioctl calls.
When the application does a ioctl(fd_of_mnt_video0,VIDIOC_G_FMT,&arg) 
for example, there is no way for the userspace helper to catch this ioctl.
The application could only open/read from the userspace helper's file 
/mnt/video0.
ioctl would still have to be done on the kernel device driver.
I thought also about a /proc interface for decompression algorithms (a 
helper would listen on a /proc file and write on another /proc file) but 
/proc is not designed for that kind of thing.
A separate library seems to be the simplest solution.
