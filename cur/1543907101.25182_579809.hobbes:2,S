If you don't have an HPET (and most single-processor systems do not) the kernel 
is probably using the PIT to wake the processor from low-power sleep states, 
since the LAPIC timer is disabled in these states.  If your box is mostly idle, 
you might want to use powertop to figure out why it's entering low power states 
so infrequently.
