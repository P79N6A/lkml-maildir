How do you propose to queue pid's? This is space constrained. I don't
believe it's feasible and/or desirable to attempt this, as there are
4 million objects to track independent of machine size. The general
tactic of cyclic order allocation is oriented toward making this rare
and/or hard to trigger by having a reuse period long enough that what
processes there are after a pid wrap are likely to have near-indefinite
lifetimes. i.e. it's the closest feasible approximation of LRU. If you
truly want/need reuse to be gone, 64-bit+ pid's are likely best.
