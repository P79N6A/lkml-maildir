You want to spread the load, but that is hard to do without knowing
which interrupt sources are heavy and which are light.
Dividing them once might end up with keyboard & mouse interrupts
on one cpu and network+disk on another.  This is clearly imbalanced.
An irq balancing utility will fix this, by balancing based
on interrupt count.

Makes sense only if the amounts of interrupt work and other work matches
the division you make.
