Look in drivers/i2c/*
The details depend on what algorithm your interface uses.
For "bitbanging" algorithm for example, timing information
is coded in the last parameters of the struct
i2c_algo_bit_data.
That said, i2c normally automatically slows down at the
speed of the slowest device on the bus, so it may well be
that the 10Khz you see has nothing to do with your kernel
driver.
