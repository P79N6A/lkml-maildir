Chuck was not referring to my original version of that patch.
As that patch's log says:
    This follows on my "x86_64 ia32 syscall restart fix".  This didn't
    matter until that was fixed.
The "x86_64 ia32 syscall restart fix" patch was not merged before the follow-on.
It's in Ingo's x86/for-linux as commit 5813a19cba5735b629cdeb156863dab814759128.
Thanks,
Roland
