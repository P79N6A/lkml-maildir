Cool - I gave up on 2.4 before that. Perhaps it's getting sorted out now
... is the buffer_head stuff fixed now? If 2.4 VM was more or less the same
across distros, that would get rid of a whole bunch of pain.

That wasn't what I meant ... but I think there's a place for a tree
of common vendor 2.4 fixes & features, a separate one for the workstation
and server stuff if you will. All the current duplication of effort seems
rather silly.
