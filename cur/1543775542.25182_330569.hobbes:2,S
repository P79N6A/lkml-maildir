I was wondering why the rawhide gcc (4.0.0 20050622 (Red Hat 4.0.0-13))
blew up whilst trying to compile -rc3 and newer, with this informative
error..
include/asm/mmzone.h:154: error: syntax error before numeric constant
So I dug around, and I've not yet tested my theory, but this
looks just.. wrong.
#if CONFIG_NUMA
extern struct pglist_data *node_data[];
#define NODE_DATA(nid)  (node_data[nid])
#ifdef CONFIG_NUMA
The first #if used to be a #ifdef CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM,
which made a little more sense to me, but I don't fully
understand the recent changes yet.
Anyone have clues ?
