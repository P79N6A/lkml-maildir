Thanks for you recponce!
Yes, it seems possible. At least it continue to run just fine after
oops for 2.4.22pre6aa1.
Btw I've managed to get a hard lockup with 2.4.22pre7aa1 in the same
scenario. It just stops responding to even Alt+SysRq+* from keyboard.

No, I'm not using bigpages.

I doubt it depends on bigpages because they
are not used in my setup. But I can live with that. Rule: do not run
`swapoff -a` under load doesn't sound as impossible in my case (if this
is the only way to trigger this problem).
