So... an RT .mp3 player task that receives asynchronous signals from a
non-RT .mp3 player GUI front-end? So, we assume that the .mp3 data
gets sent from the non-RT file system to the RT task (via the non-RT
GUI front-end) in its entirety before it begins playing...
Other than as a play RT project, seems like a waste of effort to me... :-)
The result will be that your compiler/debugger/editor/etc. will have limited
access to the CPU, and will therefore likely run slower. (The rest of the
processes effectively run as "idle tasks")
