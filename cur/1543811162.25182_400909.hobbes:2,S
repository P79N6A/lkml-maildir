I have tested two SATAII150TX4 (chip PDC40518 id: 105a:3d18 (rev 02)) 
adapters and one SATA300TX4 (chip PDC40718-GP id: 105a:3d17 (rev 02)) 
adapter on three different boards in last several days with exactly the 
same results.
The problem disappears when using the driver form the www.promise.com site.
BIOS, Grub and promise.com driver agree the printed and documented port 
order is correct but the current kernel driver exports (wrong) 3-2-4-1 
port order.
Thanks,
Milan
