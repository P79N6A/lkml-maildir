OK, good.

If they isolate it by setting the cpus_allowed masks of processes
to reflect the way they'd like balancing to be carried out, then
the partition will be made for them.
But an explicit control might be required anyway, and I wouldn't
disagree with it. It might be required to do more than just sched
partitioning (eg. pdflush and other kernel threads should probably
be made to stay off isolated cpus as well, where possible).
