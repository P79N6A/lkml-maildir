IIRC, the way we free pages is basically random shootdown. We don't even 
attempt to free pages in a contiguous block, so it's unsuprising it doesn't
work. Now we have rmap, we should be able to walk through a block, see if
everything in it looks swappable, and then try to shoot it down. If not,
move onto the next one. I think that'd be a damned sight more likely
to free things up for higher order allocs if they do happen.
