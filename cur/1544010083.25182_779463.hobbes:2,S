Well, one thing that does irritate me is that it scares people who can't 
do anything about it, and probably _shouldn't_ do anything about it.
I wonder if we should just change the "Warning" message to "Informational" 
or something. Yes, they are often real bugs. But no, they're not 
_automatically_ bugs. Almost all the time when a warning triggers, it's 
really just a developer who wants to know about it, it's not something 
that a user should really care/worry about.
