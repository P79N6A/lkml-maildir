There is one issue missing in shm fs mm for real tmpfs usage: We
cannot do private writeable mappings. This is probably something we
get when we rework the shm stuff to use the page cache.

Yes read/write, special files and directories are missing.
ftruncate is working but has to be better for write support. This also
should be easy after integration into the page cache.
The directory handling stuff is a bigger task which would be needed
for tmpfs: The shm fs is now directly tied to the SYSV IPC structure
which does not fit for hierarchical file handling.  If we had a real
directory handling we would also win the ability to mount it several
times.

I would imagine a really nice lockup :-)
