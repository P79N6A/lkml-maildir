Hi Linus,
DOSEMU needs to alias memory, for instance to emulate the HMA. A long time
ago this was done using mmaps of /proc/self/mem. This was replaced by
mremap combined with IPC SHM during 2.1 development.
According to DOSEMUs changelog you agreed to allow old_len==0:
            - using _one_ big IPC shm segment and mremap(addr, 0 ...)
              (Linus agreed on keeping shmat()+mremap(,0,..) functionality)
so you agreed on something you have removed after all now!
(comment in DOSEMU source)
  /* The trick is to set old_len = 0,
   * this won't unmap at the old address, but with
   * shared mem the 'nopage' vm_op will map in the right
   * pages.
   */
An example usage is as follows:
shmget(IPC_PRIVATE, 31498240, 0x1c0|0600) = 11337732
shmat(11337732, 0, 0)                   = 0x40299000
shmctl(11337732, IPC_RMID, 0)           = 0
mremap(0x402a9000, 0, 65536, MREMAP_MAYMOVE|MREMAP_FIXED, 0) = 0
mremap(0x402a9000, 0, 65536, MREMAP_MAYMOVE|MREMAP_FIXED, 0x100000) = 0x100000
The security problems only affect the case new_len==0 so I don't see any
reason for not applying this patch.
