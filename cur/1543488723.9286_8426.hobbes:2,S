My own machine is running DNS.  I've got the default caching DNS
setup as provided by redhat, plus I've configured my own DNS for
my local network.  My local domain is private:  red.prv
So all my machines are: something.red.prv
After reading the error message, and then your reply, it makes me
wonder if my own DNS is misconfigured?
I'm getting this error very frequently so I'd like to resolve the
issue if possible.  If this is a local machine issue, can you
help me with this?  Can anyone?  I've just set up the DNS about a
week ago and it was my first time setting up DNS from scratch.
It works, but it certainly may be misconfigured.  It is just a
reserved private network that it is serving so I figured it isn't
going to cause too much trouble.
Thanks,
TTYL
