I put a new version in DRM CVS that uses the symbols directly. It
checks out with AGP compiled in and not in.
You might want to give DRM CVS another look. We are getting ready to
submit the code in the linux-core/shared-core directories to the
kernel.
There are still coding style issues. These are slowly getting fixed
but on the other hand we don't want to break the working code. We can
fix a few more on each round of submissions. Main highlights of this
version are elimination of the DRM() macros and elminination of
inter_module() use for both DRM and AGP.
