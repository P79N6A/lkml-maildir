Does anybody do that? That's a horribly stupid prefetch, and nobody sane
should ever do anything like that, _especially_ if they don't have
cache-coherency at all layers.
Sure, "prefetch for writing" makes sense, but that shouldn't mark them
cacheline dirty, it should just try to get it exclusively. Does anybody
really mark it dirty?
