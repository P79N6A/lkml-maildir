Still not an explanation.  What exact issue is that?  Is is just faster
this way or doesn't it work another way?  Why is ppc64 so different from
other plattforms, e.g. why does ist this set when I boot my (well, if I had
one :)) G5 mac with a 64bit kernel and why not when I boot it with a 32bit
kernel?  As you mention byte ordering why is it not needed for other
big endian system.

No.  The timer should be embedded into the object it's associated with,
and you must call del_timer_sync in the object destructor.  BTW, you have
a lot of timers, more than the other fc drivers counted together.  This
looks slightly fishy.

You have a structure type lpfcDRVR_t but just a single global instance
of it.  Aka the data structure is just obsfucation and each member should
be a driver-wide variable of it's own.

It's really awkward to follow.  See qla1280.c to see how to use 2.6-style
probe/release calls in a 2.4ish enviroment.  Been there, done that.

Dito.  Note that this one is especially awkward because of the brainded
pass index instead of object calling convention.

Ok, braino.  Of course you're right, I was thinking of the mempool.

Still doesn't say why they can't be global.  You'd need to uncomment
mempool_resize in mm/mempool.c for that, though.
