With "kernel-doc" do you mean what explained into
Documentation/kernel-doc-nano-HOWTO.txt file?

No... checkpatch.pl reports everything OK.

I don't understand well what I should do here... I supposed __KERNEL__
define was defined to allow mixing kernel and userland code.

Regarding ldisc support we should ask to Alan which solution he

However I suppose is better having the LinuxPPS's core inclusion and
then solve the serial support issue.

I'll start changing the code ASAP and I'll ask to you if something

Thanks for your help and time,
