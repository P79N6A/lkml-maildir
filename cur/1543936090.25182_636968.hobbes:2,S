no, unfortunately no kernel crash dump on disk ;( (I hope I understood
it right, I'm pretty noobish concerning collection of error data ;) )
I only have the console-output of the hardlock in:
http://kerneloftruth.neucode.org/other/crash_ia32_64/not_tainted/
and a call trace from an earlier crash but I don't know if it's worth anything:

just FYI: the crash also occurs with preemptible rcu disabled (classic
rcu) (just saw that I had it enabled in that kernel ...)
