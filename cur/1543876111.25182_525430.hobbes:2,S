Actually, having thought more about this, I'm beginning to believe
Jiri's original FF_RAW approach could actually be a good option to add
3d effect support to the API. It would be similar to FF_CONSTANT but
instead of angle+magnitude the force is defined as s16 per every axis
(so it could actually be used with current drivers as well).
Alternatively we could define FF_3D_CONSTANT as an usual FF_CONSTANT
with an additional direction value, allowing a 3D force to be described
using 2x direction and magnitude.
Or we could define both ;)
Howewer, if I understood correctly that the 3 values the phantom device
takes are not really magnitudes along X, Y, Z, but some possibly
unaligned motors specific to this device, we cannot really abstract the
device motors into a 3D force effect. We could still add some FF_RAW
type, however, but with the values representing motors instead of axes,
with the exact function (direction) of each motor being left undefined
in the API (unlike the FF_RAW type I was talking a few paragraphs ago,
this type of course wouldn't be used at all by other drivers).

The generic PID driver implements that. I also think implementing the
support in software for the devices not supporting triggers in hw could
be quite easily done in ff-core.c or ff-memless.c.
(I also don't know what the triggers are useful for)

How is this a problem?
