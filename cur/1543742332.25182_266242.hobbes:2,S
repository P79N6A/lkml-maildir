Just confirmed that, by removing that udelay(100) line on ali5451.c, the
result is crappy sound (worst than normally is :) and most relevant to the
subject, I get a nasty jackd XRUN storm, without even blinking an eye.
Useless.
Regarding my test results, maybe this is just a distraction. I was just
comparing the kernels, not the hardware, jackd or the ali5451 alsa driver,
which were kept as constants along the evaluation.
In fact, those tests were only about to confirm, by numbers on-the-field,
that RT-V0 is on par to RT-U3. Don't bother to compare it to your own
setup and/or hardware. These are the kind of things that YMMCV = Your
Mileage Certainly Varies :)
For example, in my own case, if those tests are done with ACPI disabled
(yes, with acpi=off), this laptop of mine just skews the results
completely: vanilla 2.6.9 gets better results, while the RT ones go
slumber. Go figure ;)
OK. I'm really running out of time now. Family's calling for the weekend.
On the next few days I'll take the latency_trace route, as Ingo proposed,
patching ali5451 and jackd to issue a sys_gettimeofday(0, 0) and
gettimeofday(0, 1) trace on/off instrumentation respectively, while using
a proper RT-V0.5.x kernel patch line (or newer).
Bye now.
