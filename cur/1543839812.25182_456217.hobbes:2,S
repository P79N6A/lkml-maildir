Please refer to the code comments in my recent patch. And also the
recent conversations between us about this. My OLS 2005 paper(CMP aware
kernel scheduler) might also help and finally the source code kernel/sched.c

No. It depends on the sched domain, its characteristics and depends
on performance/power-savings policy.

No.

No. That is the case only for some scenarios(for example when power
savings is enabled..). In the default performance policy mode, domain
characteristics will determine this value.
