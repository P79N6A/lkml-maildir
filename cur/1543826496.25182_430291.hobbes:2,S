Generic HDLC support in the synclink drivers is optional.
Should the generic HDLC code be enabled even if it is not used?
Some of our customers would scream if we started forcing
them to compile and load unused code.

If this is the accepted approach, then synclink_cs should be added also.
(drivers/char/pcmcia)
What about select WAN if HDLC instead?
Or does kbuild not propogate the reverse dependency?
(SYNCLINK_HDLC selects HDLC, HDLC selects WAN)
