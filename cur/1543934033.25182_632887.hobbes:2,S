Yes, there is a tradeoff for both.
Example:
16:30 ichi:../net/802 > l fc.o fc.ko 
-rw-r--r-- 1 jengelh users 7961 Dec 27 15:19 fc.ko
-rw-r--r-- 1 jengelh users 2453 Dec 28 23:58 fc.o
(from a recent not-so-complete patch turning CONFIG_FC etc. into =m)
If fc was modular, it might save the 2453 bytes off the core kernel image,
but adds ~5508 bytes to disk.
So one has to pick =y or =m depending on whatever suits his/her situation.
But the choice should be _available_.
