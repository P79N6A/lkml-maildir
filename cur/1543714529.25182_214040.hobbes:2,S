Very interesting!
created partition table,
kos sata # mkfs.ext2 /dev/sda1
[..skipped..]
kos mnt # cd /
kos / # mkdir wd
kos / # mount /dev/sda1 /wd
kos / # hdparm -t -a8192 /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 setting fs readahead to 8192
 readahead    = 8192 (on)
 Timing buffered disk reads:   82 MB in  3.03 seconds =  27.02 MB/sec
kos / # mount | grep sda
/dev/sda1 on /wd type ext2 (rw)
kos / # hdparm -t -a8192 /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 setting fs readahead to 8192
 readahead    = 8192 (on)
 Timing buffered disk reads:  206 MB in  3.02 seconds =  68.15 MB/sec
kos / # hdparm -t -a8192 /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 setting fs readahead to 8192
 readahead    = 8192 (on)
 Timing buffered disk reads:  206 MB in  3.02 seconds =  68.18 MB/sec
So first time it gave the same loosy 27 MB/s and subsequent tests give pretty 
good 68 MB/s! Why?
