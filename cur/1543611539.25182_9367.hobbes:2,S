Yeah, right, Linus.  We should all go home and turn loose the monkeys and
let them pound on the keyboard.  They'll just as good a job, in fact, by
your reasoning they'll get there faster, they aren't so likely to waste
time trying to design it.
I can't believe the crap you are spewing on this one and I don't think you
do either.  If you do, you need a break.  I'm all for letting people explore,
let software evolve, that's all good.  But somebody needs to keep an eye on
it.
If that's not true, Linus, then bow out.   You aren't needed and *you*
just proved it.  You can't have it both ways.  Either you are here
for a reason or you aren't.  So which is it?  You're arguing that you
don't matter.  I personally don't agree, I think Linux would be a pile
of dog doo without you.  If you don't agree, back off and see what happens.
