I suppose eject does the same as `sdparm -C eject`, and yes, it does not 
seem like you can reload an USB stick with the opposite of eject, `sdparm 
-C load` (at least these are the commands that work for CDROM devices).

I cannot close the tray of the CDROM drive with -C start (or -C ready), so 
I doubt the same will be true for USB sticks.
Maybe all of this is a limitation of USB sticks - I got to check it with 
real USB harddisks or hotswap SCA disks.
