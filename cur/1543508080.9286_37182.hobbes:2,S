hi,
		i encountered this doubt when i was reading the linux source code
( ver : 2.0.33)
        in the function shrink_mmap() which is called from
try_to_free_page() some of the pages (text pages) are thrown out of
memory without reflecting the changes in the page tables.
	-----------------------------------------------------------
			 /* is it a page cache page? */
                if (page->inode) {
                    remove_page_from_hash_queue(page);
                    remove_page_from_inode_queue(page);
                    __free_page(page);
                    return 1;
                }
	----------------------------------------------------------------
      	 i think this may create problems , when the thrown pages are
referred afterwards.
        whether i am right ? 
	
		thanks in advance.
