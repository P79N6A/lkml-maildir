Well, killing the fuse process _will_ make the system come back to
life, since then all the dirty pages belonging to the filesystem will
be discarded.

Well, NFS with a network failure has the same problem.  It's not the
userspace that's the problem, it's the non-reliability.

Currently shared writable mappings aren't allowed for non-root by
default in FUSE.  And since non-mmap writes do not dirty pages on the
long run, it's harder to run out of space with them: you need a new
filedescriptor for each page you want to steal, and you will run out
of them sooner than of pages.
So I believe that FUSE is quite secure in this respect.  Please prove
me wrong!
Thanks,
Miklos
