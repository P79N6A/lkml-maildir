Well, I'll be...
I like the seq_ stuff, and the ->read() side of things take care of the 
issues discussed in this thread. What's even nicer is that if I convert to 
that, driver callbacks become something like either:
int driver_show(struct device * dev, struct seq_file * m)
or 
int driver_show(struct device * dev, char * buf)
Have you considered doing write()?
