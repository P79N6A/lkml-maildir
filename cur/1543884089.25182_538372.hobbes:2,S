This is why the reset is being triggered - it's a workaround for a hardware
bug which checks to make sure the hardware is in the state that the
kernel thinks it is is going off.  The code has this explanatory comment:
 * 2) check for sudden death of the NIC:
 *    It seems that a reference set for this chip went out with incorrect info,
 *    and there exist boards that aren't quite right.  An unexpected voltage
 *    drop can cause the PHY to get itself in a weird state (basically reset).
 *    NOTE: this only seems to affect revC chips.
I'd suggest checking your power supply as a first step.
