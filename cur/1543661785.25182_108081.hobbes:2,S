I didn't use them. I was busy checking out where between cset-943 and
cset-944 it stopped booting, when I accidentally removed my .config
file. I recreated it from the one I posted earlier to lkml, and suddenly
all 2.5.59 kernels boot. I don't know if I'm glad it's solved or
irritated that I don't know how it was solved.
Anyway, 2.5.59-mm8 boots here just fine.
Thanks everyone!
