           Summary: ALSA Choppy During Thing Like Window Changes
    Kernel Version: 2.5.68 and 2.5.67
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: bugme-janitors@lists.osdl.org
         Submitter: pat@suwalski.net
Distribution: Gentoo
Hardware Environment: ALSA, 82801AA AC'97 Audio
Software Environment: Gnome
Problem Description:
When there is a short burst of high CPU usage, ALSA tends to skip for up to
a second. This has always worked fine with 2.4.x OSS.
Steps to reproduce:
Open anything that uses OSS-emulation with ALSA. Xine and XMMS are good
examples. Switch to windows that are pretty cpu intensive in drawing, say
Mozilla. The sound chops.
