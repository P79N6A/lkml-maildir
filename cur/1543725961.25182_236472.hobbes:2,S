Looks sane.  Did you really intend that it be buildable for all
architectures?  (There's nothing wrong with this - it's good.  But it's a
bit unusual for this sort of driver).
"IBM multiport serial adapter" seems to be a rather generic description of
this device.  Is this the only multiport serial adapter which IBM has ever,
or will ever make?  If not, then perhaps we could make the description a
little more specific?
