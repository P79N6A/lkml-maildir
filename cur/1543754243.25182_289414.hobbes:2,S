it's within a few percent, yes.  And the figures depend on how good the
I/O card is at it.  I can imagine there are some wildly varying I/O
cards out there.
However, also remember that 1MB of I/O is getting beyond what's sensible
for a disc device anyway.  The cable speed is much faster than the
platter speed, so the device takes the I/O into its cache as it services
it.  If you overrun the cache it will burp (disconnect) and force a
reconnection to get the rest (effectively splitting the I/O up anyway).
This doesn't apply to arrays with huge caches, but it does to pretty
much everything else.  The average disc cache size is only a megabyte or
so.
