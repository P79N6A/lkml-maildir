68020+Sun-3 MMU results attached below (this is for a 3/60, and it's not
suprising that it passes, as there's no real cache in this configuration
(the sun3/2xx did have external cache, but the onboard ethernet in my
3/210 is on the fritz, and it's not booting at the moment).  Note that
this is the newer version of the program which Jamie just posted.
