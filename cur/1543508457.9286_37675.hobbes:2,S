Thanks all,  I found out that it was my init string that the remote server
does not like. It was the &Q6 which apparently was turning off v42bis.
I have had to  change the init string to
ATS95=0 +MS=56 &F&C1&S0&W0, this seems to have fixed error message, and made
it faster as the +MS=56, sets the baud at 56k, and the S95=0 forces it to
lock the port at a specific speed (I set to 115,200).
I guess mindspring needs the v42bis on.
