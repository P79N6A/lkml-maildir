maybe some other things worth noting here would be:
* xfs has working journaling on linux
* xfs has a working repair_xfs (for hw failures etc.)
* xfs will soon have working xfsdump/xfsrestore
* xfs has a (i think) working fs debugger
* xfs will be hopefully soon also working on non x86 platforms
beside all of the other of its nice features (btrees etc.)

p.s.: btw. i'm in no way related to sgi :-)
