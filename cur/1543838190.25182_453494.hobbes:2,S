Subject: stack-protect in conflict with CROSS_COMPILE

Hi Sam,
We've stumbled on a problem with -fno-stack-protector and CROSS_COMPILE:
CFLAGS          := -Wall -Wundef -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs \
                   -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common
# Force gcc to behave correct even for buggy distributions
CFLAGS          += $(call cc-option, -fno-stack-protector)
round about line 310 of Makefile will cause CC to be called before we
get a chance to set CROSS_COMPILE in arch/parisc/Makefile.  For people
who are compiling 64-bit parisc kernels, this means the wrong gcc gets
called, and sometimes the compiler versions are out of sync.
We will have similar problems with:
CFLAGS          += -fno-omit-frame-pointer $(call cc-option,-fno-optimize-sibling-calls,)
Should we include the arch Makefile earlier in the proceedings?
