On the emu10k1 driver we use access_ok(VERIFY_READ) once at the beginning
of the write() routine to check we can access the user buffer. After that 
we always use __copy_from_user() and we trust it not to fail. Is this 
correct, or not?
Basically, where in copy_from_user() is it determined the function cannot
copy the entire user buffer? Is it in access_ok() only or also in 
__constant_copy_user_zeroing()?
