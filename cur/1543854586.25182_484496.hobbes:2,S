I doubt we can really reuse an existing timer, but this seems to be
the cleanest way despite that.  Let's follow the philosophy of builing
from small building blocks for our kernel APIs aswell.
Doing it this way will also ease the transition, we can the new API
that takes a timer first and then once all old queue_delayed_work users
are gone remove that API and the timer from work_struct.
As a second benefit it also makes handling the case of having both delayed
and immediate items on a single workqueue trivial.
