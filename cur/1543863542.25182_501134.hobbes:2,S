Linus,
Please pull 'master' from:
        git://git.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mchehab/v4l-dvb.git 
master. 
The patch fixes an important bug on V4L core. By doing some ioctls on an 
unexpected order, it is possible to hang the machine without needing to be 
root, causing a DoS.
   - Buf_qbuf: fix: videobuf_queue->stream corruption and lockup
This patch should also be applied also at -stable releases.
Cheers,
Mauro.
