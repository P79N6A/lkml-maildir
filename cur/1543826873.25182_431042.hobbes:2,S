	OK, i got it now.  Untested patch that should do it.

	It's custom developed board with using some motorola processor,
and the implementation there is buggy doesn't send the lenght but
this is fixable. So i'll have to fix the state machine after that.
Guy who is developing the board says that he doesn't get the ACK 
after the last byte is read too - one more thing to investigate.
Also i use some pc engines board which has geode cpu on it
and have two access busses one is at 0x820 and the second is at 0x810
but the second is not in the list of probed devices, can it be added?
