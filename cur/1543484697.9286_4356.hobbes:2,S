I've just installed 2.2.1 on my laptop (which is back from servicing -
reason why I couldn't try 2.2.0preX).
It detects my P133MMX (laptop version) as a 67MHz one.
The laptop is an Olivetti Echos, if this can help.
[I've also got some X and IDE-DMA problems, I'll try to fix them using the
documentation before whining.]

D. Monniaux
