This was discussed in this list, previously ...
Problems like this one are known as PRIORITY INVERSION: The process with
higher priority (=lower nice values) waits for a resource (or data) hold by
a low priority process. Now, effectively, the high priority process is
running at the priority of the low prio process. If the low prio process may
never get scheduled (SCHED_IDLE), this is particularily bad, as the process
could be stalled.
I think that's the reason, why the SCHED_IDLE patch (which I like very
much!) didn't go into the kernel.
The solution is PRIORITY INVERSION: If a high prio process is waiting for
something a low prio porcess provides, the low prio process should
temporarily get the high prio.
If the processes are passing data through the kernel or using kernel's
resources, it should be detected by the kernel. If data is passed in memory
(shared mem, e.g.), it's up to the userspace implementation to take care.
