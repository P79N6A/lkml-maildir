I don't know. I really looked hard to see where this was used and i didn't
find any distro using it.

kill_pid() fails.

yes.

oops thanks,

the only parisc i have still runs its native hpux 11. 
do we still need /proc/sys/kernel/cad_pid ? If it is obsolete, i'd send a 
different patch to disable this feature with some warning in dmesg and the
kill_proc(1) would stay as they are.
but may be some small distros for embedded linux use it.  
thanks,
C.
