No. The compiler can only optimize away that loop if spinner is provably 
const. Otherwise, _all_ non-const global variables would need to be 
declared 'volatile' because (as you imply) the compiler could forever assume their 
initial state has not changed.
Try it. Examine the -s. The loop is always present for me, even with -O3. 
Now, you'll notice that without a barrier, the value first loaded into the register
is never reloaded, making an infinite loop. But we know the compiler makes 
such optimizations, which is why we tell the compiler that the value 
should not be cached across the magic (barrier()) line.
