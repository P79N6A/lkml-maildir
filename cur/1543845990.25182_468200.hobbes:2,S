The default ext3 fs was used.

Yes. It is  flock_lock_file_wait.

On which filesystem were the above results obtained if it was not ext2?

All the above results are telling you is that your test involves several
processes contending for the same lock, and so all of them barring the
one process that actually holds the lock are idle.
As for the throughput issue, that really depends on the filesystem you
are measuring. For remote filesystems like NFS, locks can _really_ slow
down performance because they are often required to flush all dirty data
to disk prior to releasing the lock (so that it becomes visible to
processes on other clients that might subsequently obtain the lock).
