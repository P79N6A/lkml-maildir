I guess I missed that message.  What system didn't work right,
and how did it fail?

No, the sticker is for the entire system (HW+SW) as shipped to the customer.
ie. It is possible for the same hardware solution running Windows
to earn a sticker and land a sale, while Linux fails to earn a sticker
and loses the contract.
You're right, not all systems need to earn the sticker.
Indeed, ENERGY STAR is supposed to be a "premium" brand.
However, several governments disqualify bids for large
contracts if they do not meet ENERGY STAR.

Apparently a market for more config options of is alive and well.
Thank you for helping make the future of Linux more clear to me.
