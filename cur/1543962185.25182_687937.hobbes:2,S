That's not what I meant, and I think you know it.
Of course as many people as possible should look at other peoples patches 
and comment on them. But saying so won't _make_ it so.  And it's also 
something that we have done since day #1 _anyway_, so anybody who thinks 
that it would improve code quality from where we already are, should 
explain how he thinks the increase would be caused, and how it would 
happen.
So when we're looking at improvement suggestions, they should be real 
suggestions that have realistic goals, not just wishes. And they 
shouldn't be the things we *already* do, because then they wouldn't 
be improvements.
In other words: do people have realistic ideas for how to make others 
spend _more_ time looking at patches? And not just _wishing_ people did 
that?
