     This error is not an error as such.  It is simply telling you that you 
     had a CRC error on your UDMA transfer.  Linux will resend the request.

Always, bbut reading... linux didn't use it before.

On kernel 2.1.55 (I guess) start the support to UDMA, but it's 
not implemented on TX Pro motherboards yet.  My mootherboard 
belongs to this family, bot more advanced.
Just disabled the autodetect DMA on make config.  May be 
I can play with hdparm.  Whithout autodetect works fine.
     
Thank you anyway.
