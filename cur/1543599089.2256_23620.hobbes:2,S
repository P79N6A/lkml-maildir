There is a patch that does this (for 2.2, and 2.4 I think) called kmsgdump.
It allows you to dump oops messages to a floppy or to a printer.  It also
has a tool to make a special dump floppy which just lets the boot "pass
through" the floppy and boot from the next BIOS device.  This allows you
to leave the dump floppy in the drive all the time, in case of an oops,
but also allows the system to continue booting afterwards.
I don't know where the current kmsgdump patches are, but Google should
find them.
Cheers, Andreas
