The only piece I think they didn't bother with was the target, mainly
because the only wanted the initator upstream.  But the principle is
still the same: projects trying to make their way upstream are welcome
to send patches.

FCoE did the same thing.  Incremental patches are useful in showing
motion towards coding standards and kernel norms ... at least they gave
me the warm feeling that FCoE was heading in the right direction.
As long as the full code is in a repository somewhere anyone whose
curiosity is piqued by the patches can go and look there as well.

Certainly.
