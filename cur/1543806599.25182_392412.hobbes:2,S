It is obvious that you are completely bejond reality.
What is your background for writing lies like this one?
How about trying to find out how reality is?

The original code demonstarates that suid root is not needed
if you run on an operating system that offers the needed features (e.g. 
Solaris).

You get the hardware if you prove that you do _real_ long time work.
You constantly need to prove that you are still doing work and you need to stay 
in contact with the righ people. This is some kind of "social engineering" and 
it seems that many people from this list would have problems to do communicaton 
the right way.....
Wheening: "someboy need to to work on this" is not doing real work.
