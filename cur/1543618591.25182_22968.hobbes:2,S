It was said that code is sufficient, you can read it and ask questions on 
lkml if you will find difficult to swallow parts. You may spot some bugs 
also, that will be very good! Linux kernel needs peer review!
Writing docs wastes developer's time: they will write how they want VM to 
operate or how they think it operates (while some bug can make actual VM 
operate differently) instead of improving/debugging current VM code.
After you got to understand how Linux VM works from source, feel free to 
write docs.
Yes, it is not an easy path to VM doc. :-)
I must say I did not do it (yet?).
