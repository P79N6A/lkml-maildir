Quoting Martin Eriksson <nitrax@giron.wox.org> from ml.linux.kernel:
:What Bios are you running? You should be running the modified RU1.25 Bios,
:and have enabled MPS 1.4. Also disable "Spread Spectrum" and do *not*
:overclock.
I have the RU BIOS, I enabled MPS 1.4.
What is "Spread Spectrum?".
I don't overclock.  I never do.
I remember seeing messages about network lockups on the ABIT BP6, and
there was a patch submitted to the list.  It had to do with a Sysreq patch
that would "do something to the APIC" and re-enable network interrupts.
However, I don't remember who this was, and where the patch is.
Is the older Becker driver for the RTL8139 more robust?  I know it's no longer
maintained, but if I want to try it, how do I proceed?  I don't remember
seeing it offered in the configuration menu.
