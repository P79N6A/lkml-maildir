Ok, that's a good point.
When you brought it up in the context of our vsyscall fla^H^H^Hdebate,
I assumed you meant to use this as a technique to help fixing up more
code pointers at run time, to convert indirect jumps to direct ones.
That does dirty more pages.
Your idea of the reverted pages conveniently containing the right code
to get them patched again is quite clever, imho.
