Ah, I wasn't aware that this patch got merged into mainline. 
That was a bad thing, because it broke the ABI used by libnuma
subtly.
Please whoever merged it revert it.

Yes. I appended a patch. Linus or Andrew, please apply it.
Thanks for catching this.

Fix ABI in set_mempolicy() that got broken by an earlier change.
Add a check for very big input values and prevent excessive
looping in the kernel.
