As you will have seen, Matthias doubted whether his patch would be at the root
of the problem I am seeing. I noticed you posted some patches earlier this week.
Would any combination of those be likely to fix the bug, please? The patch
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/linville/wireless-2.6/upstream/0001-rt61pci-fix-up-merge-damage.patch
applies cleanly to 2.6.24 but the build fails :(
It seems that it may take a little while to get to the bottom of this bug. Should
I raise an incident on bugzilla?
Thanks
Chris
