Subject: NMI watchdog not ticking at the right intervals

As I have been working on my NMI patch, I have noticed that the NMI 
watchdog does not seem to be ticking correctly.  I've tried 2.4 and 2.5 
kernels, and I get the same results.  From my reading of the code, it 
should tick once a second.  However, I have had the time between ticks 
vary from around 33 to over 100 seconds.  Tbe time between ticks is 
different on every boot, but is consistent once booted.  Is there some 
divider register that's not getting initialized?
Here's my cpuinfo:
