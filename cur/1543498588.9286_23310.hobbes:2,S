	As more people have already reported 2.3.6 fails when loading shared
libraries (when trying to load init), it is unable to mmap them. It works 
with 2.3.5-ac1 but fails since 2.3.6pre1 so I suppose it is due to some 
kind of "typo" in the new mmap code ;-)
	One more thing, the new 2.3.6 seems to incorporate the new aic7xxx
5.1.17 driver, I have no oportunity to test it but it's strange that
during boot it reports that it downloads 374 instructions when with 5.1.10
(and with all the previous versions since it works with my AIC-7890) it 
downloaded 409, is this normal??
