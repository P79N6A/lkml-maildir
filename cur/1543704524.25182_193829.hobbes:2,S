It certainly didn't seem to make a difference, after doing a make
mrproper and then putting my .config back in place, it still doesn't
boot.  I'm not doing anything funky in grub, here's my boot options:
    title           2.6.2-rc1-mm3
    root            (hd0,0)
    kernel          /vmlinuz-2.6.2-rc1-mm3 root=/dev/sda2 ro
    savedefault
    boot
I point this out since the last Oops I got on boot said something
about kernel_options, but since I didn't write it down, that's not a
good report.
I'll see about falling back to 2.6.1-mm5 and then to 2.6.2-rc1 and
seeing what happens.  I could even try going back to 2.6.1 plain as
well.  
Any suggestions?  Or any other info I can provide here?
John
