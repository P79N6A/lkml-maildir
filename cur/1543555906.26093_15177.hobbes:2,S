Subject: test-10 tulip "eth0 timed out" (smp, heavy IDE use)

Using 2.4-test10 I got a series of timeout errors on my tulip network
card (Linksys LNE version 4, 00:0d.0 Ethernet controller: Bridgecom,
Inc: Unknown device 0985 (rev 11)). Networking then completely stopped
working. Restarting the interface with ifconfig fixed the problem.
I am using an SMP kernel, compiled with gcc 2.95.2 on an ABit BP6 (dual
celeron 500s, 128mb, PIIX4 using DMA).
[log extract]
Nov 28 04:04:52 twoey kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
Nov 28 04:04:52 twoey kernel: eth0: Transmit timed out, status fc664010,
CSR12 00000000, resetting...
[end]
This has only happenned once so far, I have not been able to repeat the
problem. At the time, I was simultanously using two cd drives to rip
audio cds with DMA turned on, also I was using both processors fully.
