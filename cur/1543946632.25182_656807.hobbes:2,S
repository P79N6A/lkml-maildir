Nope, that was the discussions with the IB folks.  We only use XPC and
both the messages we send and the XPC internals do not need to allocate.

That would be if we needed to support file backed mappings and hugetlbfs
mappings.  Currently (and for the last 6 years), XPMEM has not supported
either of those.  I don't view either as being a realistic possibility,
but it is certainly something we would need to address before either
could be supported.
