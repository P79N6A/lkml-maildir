Hello,
I had the problem with 2.4.22, 2.4.22-ac4, 2.4.23 and 2.4.24-pre1.
The problem is that all the kernel is working "twice the speed".
The command "while true; do date; sleep 1; done;" shows that the date is growing
2 seconds per second... :/
I found a patch for irqbalance for 2.4.23, and now I don't have the problem 
anymore with the clock.
http://www.hardrock.org/kernel/2.4.23/irqbalance-2.4.23-jb.patch
With 2.6.0-test11, I didn't have any problem, but we can't switch to 2.6.0 yet
production.
I think it is a bug with the via chipset, but I'm not able to get deeper in the
kernel code.
Thanks
Miro
