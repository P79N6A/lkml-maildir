No, vmsplice can't help here. ISCSI-SCST is a kernel space driver. But, 
even if it was a user space driver, vmsplice wouldn't change anything 
much. It doesn't have a possibility for a user to know, when 
transmission of the data finished. So, it is intended to be used as: 
vmsplice() buffer -> munmap() the buffer -> mmap() new buffer -> 
vmsplice() it. But on the mmap() stage kernel has to zero all the newly 
mapped pages and zeroing memory isn't much faster, than copying it. 
Hence, there would be no considerable performance increase.
