I'm no expert on the hardware side of things, but from what I know, it's  
really only these hardware devices that are accessing memory while we're  
doing the copyback that are the problem. All processes are stopped and  
we've called device_suspend(). Nothing but us should be using/modifying  
the page tables.

Not so much a flaw in the suspend code as something that needs to be dealt  
with: it's not a bug for pages to have protection, and its not a bug for  
us to need it temporarily removed in order to do the copyback. We just  
need the support in the drivers to achieve that. When we have it (as we do  
in some cases in 2.4), all is well.
Regards,
Nigel
