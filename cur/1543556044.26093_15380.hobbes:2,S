Do you have an ISO C standard to refer to?  I don't, but my guess is
that the standard does not even *mention* discreet data sections.  It
*does* say that globals and statics are implicitly initialized to 0 --
the rest is a mere implementation issue.
So yes, the two statements *are* trivially equivalent, unless I'm wrong
and the standard *does* talk about data sections.

Binary patching?  If you are binary patching something you need to get
the exact location, one way or another.  Whatever tool you use to
extract the location of a symbol in an object file, that same tool
should tell you which section it is in.  If the tool only looks in
'.data', it is flawed.

Some boot targets are not compressed.  And the variables are scattered
through the .data section rather than all in one place, so the 0s may
not compress as well as you'd think.
Anyway, by some estimates 'vmlinux' has gone down by several kilobytes
due to these patches.  Obviously the exact savings depend on .config .
