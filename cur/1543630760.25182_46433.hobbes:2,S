The short answer is the driver currently does not support proper overlap
and release of the bus (channel/hwif).  Until this is committed to code to
support a multi-threaded request to schedule on service priorities, it is
not doable.  Burn-Proof will greatly assist in a solution, as a means to
force the device to spin while doing dual burns.  Thus some means for a
channel/hwif merging queue is needed.  I have a partial whiteboard
solution but it is incomplete.
