Hello!
 I needed to write program similar to loopback device. I.e. I should
 implemented another one crypt algorithm and module should correctly
 work with none-device filesystems (smbfs, nfs, ...). Working with
 none-device fs implemented using f_op -> read() and f_op -> write()
 functions of this filesystems (but in this way we have 2 caches:
 before and after our module) and module correctly works with this fs.
 But for device filesystems I should implement request handler. It
 will practically copied from loop.c, but then I spent more time
 rebooting my computer, because it becomes not responding after
 copying /usr/src/linux on my mounted device. Then I decide change
 major of loopback device from 7 to 110 (this major I use for my
 module) and loopback device also halted my computer!!!! When I have
 changed major from 110 to 7, it was worked againg!
 I don't understand why this is happend??? Or some majors better than
 another? and what major should I use for my module?
 P.S. Please, reply me through CC, because I'm not member of this
 mail-list.
 P.P.S. I'm sorry for my ugly English :)
Bye...
