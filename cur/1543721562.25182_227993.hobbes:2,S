Subject: Use of Moxa serial card with SMP kernels

Moxa serial card option not available when requesting an SMP kernel  (2.6.7)
I was told back when 2.6.4 was new that the selection of a Moxa serial card 
was not possible if an SMP kernel was selected.  I used the work-around of 
not using an SMP kernel.
My question:   Is this a permanent problem which will never be fixed or a 
temporary situation?
Thanks.
