If I have a system that is a Pure64 environment, I try to compile Silo, 
it will not function. Since there is no support for 32 bit, how would I 
be able to use it.
Isn't there a way to compile the programs necessary as 64bit but the 
actual mbr or .b files depending on your architecture be 32 bit. I
In the case of Silo, it compiles, but when you run silo -f, when you 
reboot, it Starts Silo, then gives, Program Terminiated in OBP. Which 
now makes the computer useless, unless you have a 32 bit build of silo 
standing around.
Also in the case of Silo, if you try to compile it on a modern tool 
chain, the .b files it generates don't work, which I have reported 
upstream. Modern toolchain = binutils 2.16.1, gcc 3.4.4, and glibc 2.3.5.
For the Sparc64 builds, I'm starting to look at using OBP to do the booting.
