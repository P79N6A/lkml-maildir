I think this is a result of the "blockdev in pagecache" change added in
2.4.10.  One of the byproducts of this change is that if a block device
is closed (no other openers) then all of the pages from this device are
dropped from the cache.  In the case of a floppy drive, this is very
important, as you don't want to be cacheing data from one floppy after
you have inserted a new floppy.
In contrast, if you mounted the floppy instead of using mtools, it would
probably have good performance for small files as well.
Cheers, Andreas
