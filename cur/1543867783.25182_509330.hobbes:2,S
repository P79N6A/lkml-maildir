The above suggestion would not work if SPU_FS is not defined, since the 
entire config option is ignored if an undefined symbol is used.  So, 
here's what I propose instead: 
    - Leave the existing 'config OPROFILE' unchanged from its current 
form in mainline (shown below)
    - Add the new 'config OPROFILE_CELL' (shown below)
    - In arch/powerpc/configs/cell-defconfig, set CONFIG_OPROFILE=m, to 
correspond to setting for CONFIG_SPU_FS
    - In arch/powerpc/oprofile/Makefile, do the following:
                oprofile-$(CONFIG_OPROFILE_CELL) += op_model_cell.o \
cell/spu_profiler.o cell/vma_map.o cell/spu_task_sync.o
===========
config OPROFILE
        tristate "OProfile system profiling (EXPERIMENTAL)"
        depends on PROFILING
        help
          OProfile is a profiling system capable of profiling the
          whole system, include the kernel, kernel modules, libraries,
          and applications.
          If unsure, say N.
config OPROFILE_CELL
        bool "OProfile for Cell Broadband Engine"
        depends on OPROFILE && SPU_FS
        default y if ((SPU_FS = y && OPROFILE = y) || (SPU_FS = m && 
OPROFILE = m))
        help
          Profiling of Cell BE SPUs requires special support enabled
          by this option.  Both SPU_FS and OPROFILE options must be
          set 'y' or both be set 'm'.
=============
Can anyone see a problem with any of this . . . or perhaps a suggestion 
of a better way?
Thanks.
