but ... i dont just unqueue 'for some reason and then volia'. If we did 
that we'd be losing patches left and right. Every patch we unqueue 
happens in a very predictable protocol that should avoid patches getting 
lost.
( basically we only remove any patch when they are broken but even then
  there's a clear notification. Even a NAK or other fatal review 
  feedback does not actually remove a patch in the typical case when the 
  patch otherwise has practical use, and update is hoped for and the 
  patch does not break things - it just freezes the patch at the "must 
  not go upstream yet" end of the queue. )
if we lose any patches then let us know so we can improve the protocol.

ok, we'll push it upstream via x86.git after some test period.
