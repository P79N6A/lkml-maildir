We can make this even stronger if desired.

We can certainly make the warning louder as Denis suggests, and also
make the wording in the documentation stronger, like so...

If needed, I'd be willing to taint the kernel to reduce the burden
of related bug reports.  I'm a little concerned that tainting conveys
a meaning of GPL conformance questionability, which would not be the
case here. (Just configuration questionability...  ;-)
This is primarily to support embedded systems with known hardware, but
I *DO* see the need to avoid having desktop people experiment with it
and make themselves (and by transitivity kernel developers) unhappy.
This is, admittedly, introducing a gun which one might use to shoot
one's own foot.  However, in my testing these delays accounted
for about 70% of total kernel bootup time, and this is a pretty easy
way to "fix" it.  I know many companies are very willing to bear
the burden of testing this out on their hardware before shipping
products (Sony would), in exchange for the dramatic bootup time
savings.
I'm still considering Jeff's comment, and I'll respond to that separately.
