You know, I finally have a clue again.
The Yenta issue is a complete red herring, and it just so happens that
another change happened to pc_keyb.c at around the same time as the new
cardbus stuff. And I suspect it is a problem only with certain super-IO
chips, and those chips probably tend to be used mostly in laptops, which
is why there seemed to be sucha strong correlation..
Very simple test: in drivers/char/pc_keyb.c, at around line 446, there's a
line line
	/* Ignore error bytes */
	if (!(status & (KBD_STAT_GTO | KBD_STAT_PERR))) {
		...
and people who have the "keyboard and mouse goes away" problem should just
remove that single if-statement completely.
Does that really simply change make your keyboard come to life again?
