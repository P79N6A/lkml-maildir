code.  It would of saved me time if it was there.

+CONFIG_MD_MULTIPATH
+  Multipath-IO is the ability of certain devices to address the same
+  physical disk over multiple 'IO paths'. The code ensures that such
+  paths can be defined and handled at runtime, and ensures that a
+  transparent failover to the backup path(s) happens if a IO errors
+  arrives on the primary path.
