It probably won't be the allocators which generate warnings.  The main
problem will be that newly allocated memory will still be considered
initialized by its previous owner.  Also, if UML allocates memory using
mmap, all memory will be considered to be initialized.

Doing a few base-level allocators first (get_free_page, kmalloc) will
find lots of problems, then you can start refining to the more
specialized allocators.
