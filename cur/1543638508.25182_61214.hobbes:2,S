Prefetch generally means 'bring it into the cache'. On architectures with
non-cache-coherent DMA, doing a prefetch on wild address which happens to be
a DMA buffer for which we've just said 'drop it from the cache' is generally
a bad thing.
Not that I'm necessarily disagreeing with you -- but can you confirm that 
you are including all architectures with non-cache-coherent DMA in the 
'broken hardware' category below, or point out what I'm missing?
