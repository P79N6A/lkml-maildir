a) Print every 4 seconds, this will replace one division by a bit-test:
... int retries = 32 ...
... if (! (retries & 0x3)) /* is a multiple of 4 */ ...
I choose 32 because I saw SCSI controlers taking an enormous amount of time
until detecting all devices. Maybe it's still too low for bus 7 id 15, but
I'd wait for someone to complain.
b) I saw no benefit from using 'short' instead of 'int' when I did a small
test (with uudecoding on i386) some time ago, but I could make the
resulting code be smaller and use less memory accesses by introducing some
temporary ints to hold the chars I was operating upon. Are there contrary
experiences that lead to using 'short' here?
c) This patch will sleep for a second after the last try before it
continues to panic. It's OK for me, but maybe there is a better way of
doing this.
@ Andrew Morton:
The patch with a timeout is needed because the machine might be on a
remote location and rebooted using lilo's once-only feature. An automatic
reset after the panic will bring it back.
