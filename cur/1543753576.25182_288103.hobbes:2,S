Well on my test systems I have pretty good accurate time. But I agree,
PIT is not the best option for interrupt. It should be possible to use
other interrupt sources as well.
It should not matter where the timer interrupt comes from, as long as 
it comes when programmed. Updating time should be separate from timer
interrupts. Currently we have a problem where time is tied to the
timer interrupt.
I'll take a look at your patch again, and check out the APIC part.
Regards,
Tony
