I would be interested also in what's the problem with our current
versions.

Just for reference, SUSE does this already since some time.  There was
one version in the 8.x series that was indeed broken but since then
I'm not aware of any issues.
SUSE Linux 9.1 has:
# cdrecord --version
Cdrecord-Clone-dvd 2.01a27 (x86_64-suse-linux) Copyright (C) 1995-2004 Jörg Schilling
Note: This version is an unofficial (modified) version with DVD support
Note: and therefore may have bugs that are not present in the original.
Note: Please send bug reports or support requests to 
http://www.suse.de/feedback
Note: The author of cdrecord should not be bothered with problems in this version.
Andreas
P.S. Yes, I do work for SUSE.
P.P.S: I think this is getting more and more offtopic for
linux-kernel.  Should we move the discussion somewhere else?
