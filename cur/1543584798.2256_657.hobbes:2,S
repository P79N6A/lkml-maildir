How much point is there to this kind of cleanup in CML1, really?
After the fall LinuxWorld meeting I was under the impression that mec
and the rest of the build team were planning to support switching to
CML2 for the 2.5 series.  If that's not true, someone should clue me
in *now*, before I go misrepresenting anybody's position at the 2.5
kickoff workshop.
But if we're going to push Linus and the kernel crew to switch to
CML2, then why invite the political tsuris of trying to get a large
patch into 2.4 now?  Maybe I'm missing something here, but this doesn't
seem necessary to me.
