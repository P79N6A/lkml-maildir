Yep, I had already made that change locally. I will run it overnight on
several cameras just to be sure, and will send a patch tomorrow.
I also did some more investigation and straightened out my knowledge of
file_operations: release() can never be called while inside a read() or
ioctl(): This would imply that separate threads are in use, and the
driver's release() function is not called until *all* threads have
closed the fd.  In other words I'm now much more confident that this
patch is not removing any necessary locking.
