Hello! I try to modify the sock Structure in sock.h in order to record 
some data!
I just add a unsigned short in the end of the structure. such as:
struct sock {
    /* Socket demultiplex comparisons on incoming packets. */
    __u32            daddr;        /* Foreign IPv4 addr            */
    __u32            rcv_saddr;    /* Bound local IPv4 addr        */
         ...................................................................
        ....................................................................
  void                    (*destruct)(struct sock *sk);
  unsigned short        data;                 /*I put the unsigned short 
here*/
};
 I re-complied the kernel.  The kernel and network functions work 
normally so far.
However, I am a new guy for the kernel programming. I just wonder this 
modification is
safe or not. Is there any side-effect? Or I need to add additional code 
to avoid some unexpected
situation?  Thank you very much!
