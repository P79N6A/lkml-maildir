Here is the error log with reiserfs check mode on + patch applied :
ReiserFS: sda3: found reiserfs format "3.6" with standard journal
ReiserFS: sda3: warning: CONFIG_REISERFS_CHECK is set ON
ReiserFS: sda3: warning: - it is slow mode for debugging.

Kernel panic - not syncing: REISERFS: panic (device Null superblock): 
vs-8025: set_entry_sizes: (mode==c, insert_size==-4958

The partition had just been checked with reiserfsck (2 days before) and 
it was ok. I didnt reboot between the reiserfsck and the crash.
Here was the result of reiserfsck before the crash:
Checking internal tree..finished
Comparing bitmaps..finished
Checking Semantic tree:
finished
No corruptions found
There are on the filesystem:
         Leaves 423085
         Internal nodes 2932
         Directories 1046685
         Other files 8739829
         Data block pointers 75038187 (0 of them are zero)
         Safe links 0

Btw, i forgot to mention the mount options:
noatime,notail,usrquota
I just applied the patch submitted by Jan Kara:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4771#c3
I dont know yet if it solves the problem :)
