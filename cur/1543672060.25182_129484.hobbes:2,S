Acatually, the blacklist is only needed on the SuSE kernel because they are
using a backport of the 2.5 ACPI code.  However a tiny bit of code used to
ID and enable the summit bits sliped through and the quick solution was to
blacklist it until the proper fix is included. 
Right now there are no x440 specific patches pending for Vanilla 2.4 or
Vanilla 2.5. As issues are found and resolved, patches will be submitted
first thing for inclusion into mainline.
thanks
