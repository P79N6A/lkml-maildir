I do know how the Perl interpreter works, but I think it byte-compiles the
code and puts it in the data segment, which also would have a high paging
cost.
The perl source code would be paged in/out before running binaries such as
shells and the window system, but the same thing would happen to binaries
with short life-span, I suppose.  Perhaps cached executables and cached
data files can be classified differently as well.
What I meant to ask with the question above was if it would be hard to
implement the classification in the kernel.
