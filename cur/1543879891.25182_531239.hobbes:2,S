Ok, increasing the number of prio-levels is one thing, but I was more 
thinking of reducing the effective difference between each prio-level. For 
example, this would allow max_tpt_bonus=18, while the effective range would 
be 3, thus reducing granularity.  Would this be easily introduceable?
Thanks!
