Hello all....I'm in a bind and am hoping someone has some advice!  Another
person was working with the host's /proc/scsi files and it entirely hung and
had to be powercycled.  (I'm still not sure what caused the hang - there
weren't any errors whatsoever.)  Once it was rebooting, it came up with an
error of Invalid partition.  The host is Dell 2300 with 2 450MHz cpu's and
an aic78x0 chip on-board running RH v6.0 upgraded to v2.2.11.
I used the boot and rescue disks to try to recover it.  /dev/sda-/dev/sda15
were listed in /dev, but  /dev/sda1 wasn't listed in /etc/fstab so I
inserted the listing for it and tried to mount /dev/sda1.  I get an error
of:
"mount:  the kernel doesn't recognize /dev/sda1 as a block device (maybe
insmod driver?)"
What am I doing wrong??  How can I get my system back up?
Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!
Thanks!
Heather
