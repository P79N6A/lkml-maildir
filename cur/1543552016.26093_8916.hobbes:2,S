Hi,
Are you sure that you used the right System.map?

Here, scsi_dispatch_cmd() isn't that large.. it's only 0x168 in size.
(scsi_dispatch_cmd+0x1c6 is very close to scsi_wait_req():down (&sem))
If you want to try some light troubleshooting, grab kdb..
ftp://oss.sgi.com/www/projects/kdb/download/ix86/kdb-v1.5-2.4.0-test9-pre9.gz
.. and check what both cpus were up to at lock time.  A stack trace of
both cpus might help developers locate the trouble.
