Divide the disk into N buckets.  When queuing requeusts, queue them into the 
appropriate bucket.  When running the disk scheduling algorithm, do a linear 
scan of all items in the current bucket.  Weight the scheduling factor used to 
service a bucket using a heuristic based on three factors:
1) absolute distance from current bucket
2) maximal age of request in the bucket
3) number of requests in the bucket.
This gives you a balance between global fairness and local optimization which 
is tweakable by choosing N.  In a spread access pattern, this would behave 
better than a simple age/distance heuristic, as you get a nice optimization 
from scanning an entire bucket at a time.  In a localized access pattern, any 
"outside" requests get serviced as timely as possible when their age 
contributes to their heuristic function.
Just a suggestion, I'm not aware of whether this has already been tried.
