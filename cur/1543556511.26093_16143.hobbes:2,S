Hello,
In a recent posting Linus Torvalds mentioned
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=97598683318724&w=2) :

uses it anyway, but it would be more polite to just support it).
I was thinking about using mmap for shared mememory in my program, but now I
am reconsidering. 
Is the System V or Posix mechanism for shared memory a better(it will be
supported in 2.4) choice?
