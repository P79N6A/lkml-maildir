Hello,
I've read this thread...
And I want to join this request...
It might be that suspend2 is not the best solution, but 
maybe if you merge it and then work together in order to 
maximize the use of user space at next version, it will be 
slower process but at least the interfaces suspend2 provides 
will be available to users.
I understand the wish to minimize kernel mode usage... But 
first you should support a decent suspend disk/suspend ram 
support in Linux without forcing the user to hack his 
configuration.
At my culture we say: "The enemy of the good is the best"...
Best Regards,
