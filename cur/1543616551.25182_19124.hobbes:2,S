You seem to be using writeout_one_page().  What I was
thinking of was:
- Kill generic_buffer_fdatasync().
- Move writeout_one_page() into fs/buffer.c
- Move waitfor_one_page() into fs/buffer.c.  This is just
  for completeness; I expect this function will have no
  callers soon.  __iodesc_sync_wait_page() could use it though.
OK by you?
