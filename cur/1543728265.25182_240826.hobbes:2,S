Not that it helps at all, but the conditional move instruction was
marked as optional by Intel, hence the 'cmov' capability flag (in the
flags part of /proc/cpuinfo). As you say, the earlier C3 chips (like the
one in my firewall) lack support for this instruction:
model name      : VIA Samuel 2
cpu MHz         : 533.365
flags           : fpu de tsc msr cx8 mtrr pge mmx 3dnow
So, strictly speaking, you shouldn't use cmov for something that's
simply "i686" compatible. Of course, gcc etc. uses it because it's very
nice from the point of view of avoiding having to do branches and the
associated malarky and someone failed to spot that it was optional. So,
yes, it's not OK to use -march=i686 on these chips. Modern gccs know
about -march=c3, which ought to be a good bet for these chips (one would
hope).
