Well, when we're talking inline asms used for locking, the whole point of 
using inline asm is exactly that you cannot do it with regular accesses, 
and have to add architecture-specific barriers. If the user gets that 
wrong, then it's a user problem, not a compiler issue.
So that's not the problem. The problem is if the compiler then does other 
things wrong *despite* the inline asm being correct.
