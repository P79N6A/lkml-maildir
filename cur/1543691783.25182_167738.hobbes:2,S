There are several languages and tools besides Java which can jit code.
Perl6 (using interpreters like Parrot) and Python (using interpreters
like Psycho) are examples of this and it is not yet clear what
interfaces they will provide to allow for JVMPI like functionality.  We
would like to be able to profile applications using these interpreters
(as well as others).  If userspace interpreters, for whatever reason, do
not provide functionality for tracking jitted code, would it not be
useful to provide help in the kernel to allow profilers to be able to
track this? 
Although we understand your belief that a DGC generator that doesn't
provide hooks for determining the DGC information may not be optimal, we
would still like to be able to provide something useful to the users of
those environments.  Perhaps this philosophical discussion is better
handled offline per an earlier suggestion.

From what we can see in the Oprofile driver code, if there is no dcookie
for a corresponding EIP, the EIP information is discarded and the
"oprofile_stats.sample_lost_no_mapping" count is incremented (see
add_us_sample() in drivers/oprofile/buffer_sync.c).  Did we
misunderstand something?  Is a DENTRY (and a corresponding dcookie)
being created somewhere for DGC?

As long as there exists a userspace API similar to the JVMPI for a
particular DGC generator, and as long as the profiling tool is using
that API, then yes, it seems like this method would work.  But this
isn't the case we are worried about.
