This patch contains at least two bugs:
The static inline set_irq_info() is not available 
for CONFIG_GENERIC_PENDING_IRQ=n, resulting in the following warning:
<--  snip  -->
...
  CC      arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.o
arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c: In function `set_ioapic_affinity_irq':
arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:251: warning: implicit declaration of function `set_irq_info'
...
<--  snip  -->
The second bug is that although irq.h defines set_irq_info() as a static 
inline, this patch adds an empty function to kernel/irq/manage.c .
The second bug shadows the first bug, but both have to be fixed.

BTW: This patch is not in anyway x86_64 specific.
