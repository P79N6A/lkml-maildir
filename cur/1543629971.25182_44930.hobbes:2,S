The latter: loads can have "acquire" semantics and stores can have
"release" semantics.  For example, at the assembly level, ld8.acq
would be an 8-byte load with acquire semantics, st8.rel an 8-byte
store with release semantics.  At the C level, acquire/release
semantics is used for all accesses to "volatile" variables.
One way to think of all this is that using .acq/.rel for *all* memory
accesses will give you a memory model that exactly matches that of a
Pentium III.

Yes.

No, the address doesn't matter (data dependencies are always honored).
