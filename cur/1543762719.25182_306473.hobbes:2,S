And then the user want to upgrade the 2.0 kernel that shipped with this 
box although the company that made the hardware went bankrupt some years 
ago.
If the user has the source of the driver, he can port the driver or hire 
someone to port the driver (this "obscure piece of hardware" might also 
be an expensive piece of hardware).
Or if the driver is in the kernel sources, it might have even been 
ported.
