The reason why we don't freeze uninterruptible tasks is that we don't know
why they are in that state.  If one of tasks is uninterruptible for a
relatively long time, that may indicate a non-recoverable error making it
dangerous to put the system into a sleep state.  If the task is killable,
though, the situation is recoverable.
