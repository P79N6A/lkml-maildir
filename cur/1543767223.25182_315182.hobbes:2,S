there is the setarch command that you can use to disable it on a per
process basis.

actually no. 
It just means that half the time the old value was below the current
boundary, and half the time above. Eg half the time it was in free
space.

glibc also has some randomisations in places (for cache performance) as
did kernels before 2.6.11 on p4 hyperthreading machines (granted that
was very small randomisation)
The only reliable ways I can think of is to either take a predetermined
address, or to mmap a big chunk first, then your real chunk and then
free the first chunk. Neither are clean or pretty
