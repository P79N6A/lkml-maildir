Hi,
First, I'm sorry but I cannot afford the huge traffic of messages from
joining the list.  Can you please CC me directly with any response?
TIA.
I upgraded from test7 to test8 via the patch file and I'm now getting
the failure...
rpc.lockd: lockdsvc: Invalid argument
I have tried moving to the latest knfsd-lockd stuff to no avail.  How do
I fix this error?  There doesn't appear to be anything in the Changes on
this.
Thanks,
Sean
