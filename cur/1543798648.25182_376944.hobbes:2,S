You can always manually change THREAD_SIZE using a text editor.
My count of bug reports for problems with in-kernel code with 4k stacks 
after Neil's patch went into -mm is still at 0.
Either there are no problems left or noone pays attention to them since 
disabling 4k stacks "fixed" the problem. And not having an option makes 
it more likely that we get reports for and people interested in fixes 
for the latter.
