I just thought I would remind all the nay-sayers that the *BSD world has
been doing something along this line since at least 1990. While some of
the programs have changed, the functionality has remained largely the
same. 
It can be done.    It will be done.  
You don't have to help, but we could use it.
And we have paid attention to some of the valid differences between CVS
and CVsup.
Just a thought,

Unix is best described as an old, sturdy tree.
It is well structured, always growing, and has passed the test of time.
