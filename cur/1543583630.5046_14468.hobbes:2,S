No, that change won't happen until 2.5
I can only guess:
the other thread keeps working until it causes a page fault - with both
2.4.1 and 2.4.2.
I haven't followed the threads about the mm changes closely, but I
assume that the swapout behaviour changed, and that your worker thread
now runs without causing page faults.
