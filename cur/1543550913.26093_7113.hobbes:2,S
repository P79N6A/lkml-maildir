Hello,
  I've been using ext3 for some time now on an NFS server, with excellent
results (it's crashed once, and I didn't have to wait for fsck! yay!).  
I'm also wanting to upgrade to RAID (in software, since I'm short on
cash).
A few weeks ago Alan Cox mentioned, in reply to someone asking about
building an enourmous RAID array,
"Right now 2.2 doesnt support journalling over software raid so that would
stop you using reiserfs and ext3."

Is this still true? I was going to use 2.2.17, with ext3-0.0.3b, and Ingo
Molnar's 2.2.17 RAID patch:
