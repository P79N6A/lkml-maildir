It would do, if you could stop there and say no more.  But:
  You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
  code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you...give any
  other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the
  Program.  [GPLv2, section 1]
So you have to give recipients the license text from a particular
version of the GPL.  To make that the only version unde which the work
is licensed, you have to add something like "Licensed under the
GPLv2".  Otherwise sec. 9 says that you offer the work under any
version of the GPL, and the licensee can take his or her pick -- even
using v1 (!).
