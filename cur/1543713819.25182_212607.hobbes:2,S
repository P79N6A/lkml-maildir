Very odd. I looked at the dmesg you sent me and it looks like you're
using the ACPI PM timesource. There is an open bug (link below) against
it and I'm not sure if we're dealing with odd hardware or some other
side effect is causing the issue. 
If you disable cpufreq does it go away? You might want to try disabling
the ACPI PM timer code (under the Power Management->ACPI menu) and see
if that resolves it. 
For more details, check this bug:
