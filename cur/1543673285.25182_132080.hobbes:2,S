If this is for the host/channel/id/lun as per your cat /proc/scsi/scsi,
you are specifying id (target) 11, where you should have used 1.
You can also check the result of the write to see if it worked, not sure
if it does anything on 2.4 when the device does not exist, on 2.5 trying to
remove a non-existent device gives me:
[root@elm3b79 root]# echo "scsi remove-single-device 1 2 3 4" > /proc/scsi/scsi
[root@elm3b79 root]# echo $?
1
