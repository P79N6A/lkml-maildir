Next time I make a revision I'll put that in; since we're talking about
x86 here it's, as you say, obvious that it's littleendian.  As such, I
think it can wait.

Given that we have already established littleendian byte order, it's the
same thing.

Valid objection.  It probably should be considered as (major, minor)
bytes, but we haven't had any releases where it hasn't also been valid
BCD.  I would prefer separate bytes myself, so 2.10 = 0x20a instead of
2.10 = 0x210.

Fair enough...

Uh?  That seems more than a little silly.  Yes, I guess formally
speaking we're talking about "NUL-terminated", but the term
"null-terminated" has over 800,000 hits on Google -- 10 times as many as
"NUL-terminated" -- and is hardly an ambiguous term ("NUL-terminated" is
ugly, and "zero-terminated" is ambiguous.)

Probably makes sense.
