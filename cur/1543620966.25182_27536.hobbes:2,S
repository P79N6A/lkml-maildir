We are in violent agreement, I'm not sure where the misunderstanding came from.
Yes, the leading idea is to put it in a module.  In fact a patch exists, though
it may have issues, it's been a while since I looked at it.
Besides that, it's been suggested to stick it only the end of bzImage in a way
that some utility can find it, so that it never gets loaded into memory or does
and is immediately discarded.  Bootfs might be another way to go, or maybe
that's just a way of making the module solution more elegant.  Personally, I
think that making it a module is obviously the right way to go.  The exact
details of how the module would work haven't been hashed out yet, at least,
not recently.  I presume the module should be compressed.  Perhaps it should
only work in conjunction with some user space utility, allowing the config
info to be expressed even more compactly than otherwise possible.  There is a
lot of room for creative compression here - I roughed out a design at one point
that would be able to represent the config information in something like a
couple hundred bytes, when the compile is from a standard tree.  This is cute,
but it's probably more cute than necessary.

OK, my apologies for misinterpreting your position.
