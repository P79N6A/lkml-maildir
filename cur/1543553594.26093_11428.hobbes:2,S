Hey. I'm using an Acer 50X cdrom used with scd & ide-scsi emulation, and
I just noticed that 'df' is reporting size incorrectly:
/dev/scd1                85946     85946         0 100% /mnt/cdrom
Even though du clearly shows there is much more than 85 MB used:
$ du -s /mnt/cdrom
359397	/mnt/cdrom
Is this a known bug?
