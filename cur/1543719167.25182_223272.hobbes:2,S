 Well, if you'd mask, sync, ack (send EOI) in a handler, then the sync
would assure the ack wouldn't be in effect before masking, so no further
interrupt would arrive till unmasking.  It would work for level-triggered
interrupts and the i82093AA, but OTOH for the i82489DX, which uses
level-deassert messages, it wouldn't.
 Too much hassle for an unreliable result...  Just scrap it.
