That's right, and would explain why du may show 32 even if ls -alR
shows nothing at all (what does ls -alR /tmp show?).
But the strange thing is that df's Used does not match du: they should
be identical, though arrived at from different directions.  I've not
seen that, and have no idea what's going on: it's as if a subtree of
/tmp has become detached (a non-empty directory removed).
What usage led up to this?  What does /proc/meminfo show?
How many records out does "dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/zero bs=1k"
manage before /tmp fills up (11620 would fit df's Available,
the remaining 16k being metadata).
