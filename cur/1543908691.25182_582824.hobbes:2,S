I didn't think of heuristics but rather of a style guideline.  Maybe
prepend this metadata line with "Subject: " or so to distinguish it from
data.
What's the difference to 00-INDEX?  It's inline.  Hence,
  - as soon as a majority of files have that header, authors of new
    files will start to provide that header automatically.  Or am I too
    optimistic?
  - it's a little bit faster to create these headers than to add them
    to 00-INDEX:  Just move the existing title to the top.
There could also be "From: " and/or "Cc: " headers for authorship and
maintainership metadata.  (Of course maintainership metadata could also
go into extra files like 00-INDEX or MAINTAINERS.  Authorship metadata
of more recent documentation files is actually available in the source
control system.)

Just to clarify:  I'm *not* one of those who want the date in there.
