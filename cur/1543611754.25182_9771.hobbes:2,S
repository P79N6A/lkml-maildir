In addition to my last problem with -pre2, I went to reboot to send the
mail (pcmcia modem), and when it shut down and went to "Unmouting local
filesystems" it said "/dev/hda7 not mounted" (which is my root filesystem).
And on bootup back to 2.4.16-pre1 it said /dev/hdb7 had not been cleanly
unmounted so it fscked it.
Odd.
