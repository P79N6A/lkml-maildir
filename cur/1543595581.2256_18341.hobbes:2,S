Looking over the merges Im doing from 2.4.6pre I found a couple of suprises
the most dubious of which is the rather bogus hackery on eepro100.c
Someone has done S/CONFIG_EEPRO100_PM/CONFIG_PM/ on the driver and in doing
so permanently enabled the eepro100 pm code which to say the least doesnt work
for a lot of people but gives them weird eepro100 hangs
Since the drivers/net/Config option wasnt removed I can only conclude this was
someones internal hack that leaked out in error
Linus - I think you need to revert that eepro100 change.
