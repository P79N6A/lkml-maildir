I managed to get my hands on a dual athlon box and get it working fairly
well.  I have been unable to get agpgart working however because it is an
unrecognized chipset.  It would be great to get this working and I would
be happy to supply any info or do some testing for the developers.  On a
side note the kernel cannot identify many of the interfaces. For example:
00:00.0 Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD]: Unknown device 700c
(rev 11)
00:01.0 PCI bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD]: Unknown device 700d
00:07.0 ISA bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD]: Unknown device 7410 (rev
02)
00:07.1 IDE interface: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD]: Unknown device 7411
(rev 01)
00:07.3 Bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD]: Unknown device 7413 (rev 01)
00:07.4 USB Controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD]: Unknown device 7414
(rev 07)
00:0a.0 Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs SB Live! EMU10000 (rev
04)
00:0a.1 Input device controller: Creative Labs SB Live! (rev 01)
00:0c.0 SCSI storage controller: Symbios Logic Inc. (formerly NCR) 53c895
(rev 01)
00:0f.0 Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation 3c980-TX 10/100baseTX NIC
[Python-T]
(rev 78)
00:10.0 Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation 3c980-TX 10/100baseTX NIC
[Python-T]
(rev 78)
01:05.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV15 Bladerunner
(Geforce2 GTS) (rev a4)
Though it's not that big of a deal it would make it look more purty.
