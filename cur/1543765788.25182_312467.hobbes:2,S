Hello,
Well, with Mark Adler's help I've realized that extending zlib isn't 
than simple task.

Actually, for JFFS2 we need to leave the uncompressable data 
uncompressed. So if the pcompress interface have only been for JFFS2, 
I'd just return an error rather then expand data. Is such behavior 
acceptable for common Linux's parts pike CryptoAPI ?
And more, frankly, I don't like the "independent" partial compression 
approach in JFFS2 and in JFFS3 (if it will ever happen) I'd make these 
pieces dependent. For this purpose we'd need some deflate-like CryptoAPI 
interface. I'm not going to implement it at the moment, I'm just curious 
- what do you guys think about a generalized deflate-like CryptoAPI 
compression interface?
