Hi,
I am a developer of diskdump.

I hope all current dump functions (diskdump, LKCD, netdump, etc) are
integrated into kdump. I think it is possible if the following two
problems of kdump are solved.
(1) problem of reliability
It seems that kdump has some problems regarding hardware.

I think it is necessary to verify how surely the 2nd kernel can be 
booted.
(2) memory size problem
If memory size is huge, the time for dumping and size of dump file
become serious problem. Diskdump has functions of partial dump and
compression to solve this problem. Kdump does not have such functions
yet.
The 2nd issue (memory size problem) may be solved by exporting
diskdump's functions to kdump.
I hope these issues would be solved at first. (We can wait
for completion of kdump development by operating current
diskdump and/or LKCD.)
