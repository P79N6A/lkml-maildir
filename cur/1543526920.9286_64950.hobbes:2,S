Yes.  I'm looking at adding a F_SETFAST() fcntl, which will do a
F_SETFL, F_SETSIG and F_SETOWN at once on the socket, and return a
poll struct indicating any outstanding IO on the socket so that you
don't have to do a speculative read() to detect data arrived before you
made the fcntl call.

Definitely a good idea --- a lot of other O/Ses already have something
like that.  We can inherit socket options the same way, of course, which
will be useful for a lot of services.

TCP_CORK, linger options, all sorts of others.
