Fine. Each support call starts with: "Please recompile your kernel with
CONFIG_DEVFS=N"

What for? If you want that, hack the kernel so it works that way. Or mount
by label/UUID.

Please explain how moving a disk from one controller to the other being
renamed from c0... to c1... differs from sdb... now being sdg...

Have you looked?

I don't need that. If I wanted to name my SCSI devices that way, I'd fix
the kernels understanding of minors. Sure, that way minors run out even
faster.

OK, I'd suggest we make it a rule that whoever just has insults left as
arguments acknowledges that s/he lost the argument.
