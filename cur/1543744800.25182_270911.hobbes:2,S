static void DAC960_WaitForCommand(DAC960_Controller_T *Controller)
{
  spin_unlock_irq(&Controller->queue_lock);
  __wait_event(Controller->CommandWaitQueue, Controller->FreeCommands);
  spin_lock_irq(&Controller->queue_lock);
}
Looks alright to me, I don't understand your confusion. One thing you
could say is that either the path to DAC960_WaitForCommand should not
save interrupt flags, _or_ it's a bug to use spin_unlock_irq() if
interrutps could already be disabled at that point.
