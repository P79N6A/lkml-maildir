There are no outstanding issues raised on the base subsystem. There are
issues with the lack of features implemented, however. ;) Myself and
others are working on some enhancements for new silicon, MMIO, etc.
Jeff's comments on the rionet driver were the only remaining issues on
the current patches.  Hopefully he can ack/nack these updates to rionet.
