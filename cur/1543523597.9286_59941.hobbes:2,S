Linux Kernel,
The NWFS 2.0 drivers have a level I bug in the LRU for cross volume
copying that could corrupt the directory file in certain
configurations.  We have corrected this bug and completed the second
stage elavator. Performance has been significantly increased.  The LRU
in the previous version (our LRU not the Linux Buffer Cache) had some
performance issues because we had not completed the elevator for
mirroring and second level asynch IO.  This work in now completed. 
We will post the new drivers at www.timpanogas.com(HTTP) and
207.109.151.240(FTP) at 6 p.m. this evening after a day in the test
lab.  Performance on this version is very good.
Also, the NetWare Volume IMAGER for Volume Image/Restore and Archiving
is being released today as well and binaries are free for the linux
versions.
