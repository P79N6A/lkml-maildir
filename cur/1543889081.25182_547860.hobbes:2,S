Hi Bill,
if i've understood correctly the script runs glxgears for 43 seconds and 
in that time generates random numbers in a random number of times 
(processes, fork and forget), is that it?
You find the data, for 2.6.21-{cfs-v13, ck2} in 
http://www.debianpt.org/~elmig/pool/kernel/20070522/
Here's the funny part...
Lets call:
a) to "random number of processes run while glxgears is running", 
gl_fairloops file
b) to "generated frames while running a burst of processes" aka "massive 
and uknown amount of operations in one process", gl_gears file
kernel	2.6.21-cfs-v13	2.6.21-ck2
a)	194464		254669		
b)	54159		124
