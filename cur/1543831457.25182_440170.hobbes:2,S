Btw, this is WRONG.
The whole "ARCH_HAS_XYZZY" is nothing but crap. It's totally unreadable, 
compared to the _much_ simpler
	#ifndef xyzzy
	#define zyzzy() /* empty */
	#endif
which is a hell of a lot more obvious to everybody involved, not to 
mention being a lot easier to "grep" for (try it - "grep xyzzy" ends up 
showing _exactly_ what is going on for cases like this, unlike the 
ARCH_HAS_XYZZY crap).
And no, it does not require implementing xyzzy as a macro AT ALL. 
You can very easily just do
	/*
	 * We have a very complex xyzzy, we don't even want to
	 * inline it!
	 */
	extern void xyxxy(...);
	/* Tell the rest of the world that we do it! */
	#define xyzzy xyzzy
and you're now all set. No need for a new stupid name like ARCH_HAS_XYZZY, 
which adds _nothing_ but unnecessary complexity ("What was the condition 
for using that symbol again?" and ungreppability).
WE SHOULD GET RID OF ARCH_HAS_XYZZY. It's a disease.
