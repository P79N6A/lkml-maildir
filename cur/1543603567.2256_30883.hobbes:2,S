I believe the 'quick and dirty' patches we came up with substantially
increased context switch times for this benchmark (doubled them).
The reason is that you needed to add IPI time to the context switch
time.  Therefore, I did not actively pursue getting these accepted. :)
It appears that something in the 2.2 scheduler did a much better
job of handling this situation.  I haven't looked at the 2.2 code.
Does anyone know what feature of the 2.2 scheduler was more successful
in keeping tasks on the CPUs on which they previously executed?
Also, why was that code removed from 2.4?  I can research, but I
suspect someone here has firsthand knowledge.
