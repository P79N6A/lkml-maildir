Hello list,
Today I discovered I could no longer create files on one of my boxes, which 
still runs 2.4.18 (box is too far away to upgrade right now). It gives me 
'disk full' messages.
The following message is all over my logs since January 3:
vs-2120: add_save_link: insert_item returned -28
I can't seem to find much on this issue, is this a bug in reiserfs (which is 
fixed in a later version)? Is something wrong with the fs itself?
Thanks for answers.
[I'm not subscribed @ reiserfs-list, so please cc me with answers from that 
list]
