Hi all,
I have "fixed" the problem in a very wierd way.Reading
your post I thought maybe when removing the driver
itself it set some bit incorrectly. Then I decided to
do:
Boot with init=/bin/bash  so bypass all other things.
modprobe skge
run ifconfig eth0 ip_num  up
ping  a host
then while pinging hit Ctrl+Alt+Del key to hot reboot
the system.
I still see the light at the hub lits. Now I boot to
winXP and as I expected , it worked!
No I boot 2.6.11 and it worked, so the problem resolve
but I am tooooo scared to run 2613 now :-)
Hope this information helps debuging the driver.
Thanks.
S.KIEU
