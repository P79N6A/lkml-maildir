Which means you miss stuff. Here is an example my tools found yesterday
18 months ago someone with a specific printer reported doing network printing
to it crashed the kernel. Lost in the noise, filed in bugzilla, categorised 
mentally at the time as "weird".
Not long ago a second identical report popped up. Different setup, same
network printing, similar "it reboots" report.
So now I've gone chasing tcpdumps from these.
Its a *different* thing to the kind of patch management you are doing, but its
only possible because of tools like bugzilla
