By the same token any code that's run as/by root is untrastable and it can
destroy the system just as well.

Yes.  We are switching to a VT before snapshotting the system.

I mean it shouldn't read files from such filesystems or write to them.  They
are mounted all the time and should not be unmounted, of course.

Why?  It's quite easy to set up and virtually all distributions use it anyway.

Yes, this may happen if the userland helpers are buggy, but again any
root-equivalent process that is buggy can do the damage just as well.
Your point seem to be "we should implement this in the kernel to protect
the users from irresponsible authors of userland applications
and distributors".  I just don't agree with that.  [Going along this line of
reasoning we should implement fsck in the kernel too. ;-)]

Yes, we are doing that already and we are working on improving it further
(just now :-)).
Still, if you don't like the idea of userland-based suspend, we are not going
to remove the kernel-based suspend, AFAICT.
