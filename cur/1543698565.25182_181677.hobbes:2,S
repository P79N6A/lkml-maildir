	Hi all,
I just tried the latest 2.6.0 (test11) on a Dell 410 (a bi-PIII) and the
SMP flavor of this kernel doesn't work at all. The non-smp one works well
(so I know it's not a case of VT/VGA console missing).
It dies (without any error message) after this:
Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel
I tried disabling APIC in the BIOS but it doesn't make any difference...
Any idea?
