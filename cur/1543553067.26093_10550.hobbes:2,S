FWIW, vmalloc()-allocated pages are definitely pinned-down and
available to interrupts.  However, you should keep in mind that the
vmalloc() call *itself* is quite expensive on SMP machines (have to
interrupt all CPUs and flush their TLBs!!) so if you're using
vmalloc(), be careful with the number of calls you make.  Of course,
this is usually not a problem.
