I don't feel that statement is true in all cases.  It's true in a lot of 
cases yes, but sometimes 'support' is really simply a matter of techinga 
module one more PCI ID.  Or adding in a few lines of code for a different 
PHY in the case of an ethernet adapter/MAC.  You also don't need to change 
say the queue elevator mechanism to support a new SATA chipset.  What the 
complaint is from production systems is the fact that in many many cases 
for new hardware support all that's needed is the little bit of code way 
out on the edge, without changing anything else.  While I am of the opinion 
new hardware support in a maintenance/bugfix/stabel kernel is a gray area, 
I can see where there are many times where it could be done, without 
introducing excessive change.
Right now the most obvious is the udev/devfs problem, at some point you're 
forced to lose that, that's fine, but there's nowhere to go for bugfixes. 
That's *ONE* case.  There WILL be more/others, possibly ones that are more 
disruptive.  Yes distro's/etc should help, but some of us aren't using 
distro's.  Which is why I started the thread is to try to get a community 
based longer lived stable tree.  Hopefully one that distro's would also 
use, and contribute bugfixes and patches to, much the same way as we have 
had in the past, but without directly taking the mainline/core team since 
they've decided (and I don't begrudge them this at all) that it is too much 
work to continue maintaining a stable tree, as well as developing, the 
kernel.
If possible I'd like Sven (even privately) to summarize does not work in a 
little bit clearer way. IE what bits don't work, or does it just completely 
fail to boot?  TIA!  I think he and I are seeing the same problems and are 
on the same page with this overall larger issue.
