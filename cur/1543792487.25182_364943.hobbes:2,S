How do you access FLASH specific functionality otherwise ?
case MEMGETINFO:
....
case OTPLOCK:
It may be useless for you, but I doubt that you represent the majority
of the MTD user base. Using a RAM simulator is a bit different to the
usage of _real_ FLASH.
Look into mtd/utils and figure yourself why it _is_ useful.
The code _is_ ugly and ioctls are out of fashion, but your "remove it"
request is just silly as long as you dont provide a reasonable
alternative access to those bits.
