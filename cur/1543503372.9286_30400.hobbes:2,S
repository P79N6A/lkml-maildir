Sorry, I had it and had typed it in, but they got eaten for some reason by the 
ksymoops program.
For the first one I reported it was:
eax 00001000  ebx 00000003  ecx 00000000  edx cef10000
esi 04000001  edi 0000000e  ebp c0217ed4  esp c0217e48
ds  0018  es  0018  ss  0018
and for the second one I reported it was
eax 00001000  ebx 00000002  ecx 00000000  edx c8656800
esi 04000001  edi 0000000e  ebp c0217ea4  esp c0217e18
ds  0018  es  0018  ss  0018
I have also been pointed at 
http://www.redhat.com/~dledford/aic7xxx.html
which I am going to try as soon as I get time, perhaps next week.
Richard.
