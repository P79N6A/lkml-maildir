While running a 32 bit Java program 2.6.12-rc3 rebooted spontaneously leaving 
a corrupt partition table and disk with errors. There was nothing in dmesg 
(no oops/panic) except some -MARK- entries during the reboot.
No such problems with 2.6.11.  Hardware is a laptop - Compaq presario R3240us 
- Athlon64. It runs solid when running 2.6.11.
