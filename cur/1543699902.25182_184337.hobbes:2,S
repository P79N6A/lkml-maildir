No, it is legal to call wait* when ignoring SIGCHLD--and it is required to
return ECHILD for the dead ones.  For example, using waitpid with WNOHANG
is a valid way to poll for the liveness of a child (though there is no good
reason why an application wouldn't just use kill(,0) for that).  It's not a
method that has anything to recommend it, but it is perfectly valid and the
range of permissible results is well-specified.
