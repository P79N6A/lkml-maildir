"... unmaintained smbfs ..." is not quite right, see

Before removing it now completely, drop
  Jeff Layton <jlayton@redhat.com>
a note.
Afaik, Redhat still has customers which rely on smbfs.
In addition, cifs cannot completely replace smbfs atm.
Even todays sold NAS-boxes (often running anchient 
samba-2.x.x) work only with smbfs on the client side.
Cheers, Günter
