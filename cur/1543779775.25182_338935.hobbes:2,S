Hi Linus,
Please pull from:
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lenb/to-linus.git
I reverted several things to 2.6.12 behaviour
which should result in a higher quality 2.6.13 release:
1. Fixed the PCI Interrupt Link revert you pulled from the list.
2. Put Embedded Controller back into polling mode by default.
3. Set CONFIG_ACPI_HOTKEY to 'n' by default (updated driver too).
4. Lovingly restored the rudely deleted /proc/acpi/button/:-)
thanks,
-Len
p.s.
Latest ACPI plain patch, including stuff waiting for 2.6.14 is available

    [ACPI] CONFIG_ACPI_HOTKEY is now "n" by default
    For 2.6.12 behaviour, this (EXPERIMENTAL) driver
    should not be built.
    
    Update the driver source with latest from Luming.

    [ACPI] PCI interrupt link suspend/resume - revert to 2.6.12
behaviour
    
    This patch disables the PCI Interrupt Link refernece counts,
    which should not co-exist with the 2.6.12 irq_router.resume
    method or else a double acpi_pci_link_set() could result
    on resume.
