Sorry about the delay -- here is the fairly simple patch.  A Tested-by: 
would be appreciated.

error compiling committee.c: too many arguments to function

Subject: [PATCH] KVM: Avoid calling smp_call_function_single() with interrupts disabled
When taking a cpu down, we need to hardware_disable() it.  Unfortunately,
the CPU_DYING notifier is called with interrupts disabled, which means
we can't use smp_call_function_single().  Fortunately, the CPU_DYING notifier
is always called on the dying cpu, so we don't need to use the function at
all and can simply call hardware_disable() directly.
