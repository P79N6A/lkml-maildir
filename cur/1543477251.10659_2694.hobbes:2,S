The OOPS didn't get recorded.  When it happened it said something about it
happening in a handler and that it was not going to sync the disk.  Then
it gave me an Aiee! message that I've forgotton.  :(
I tried to "grep -i oops /var/log/*" and grep gave me a "memory exhausted"
message on my 18MB lastlog file.  I'm assuming this is a grep problem...
Here is the output from `dmesg`:

I haven't tried starting X yet, because I'm pretty sure that if we OOPS
inside of X I won't be able to see anything.  It may have just been a
fluke, but I've never seen a kernel crash so hard & I'm shell-shock now.
Let me know if this helps anyone or not,
Christopher
