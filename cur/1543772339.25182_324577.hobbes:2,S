Take a look at the lock-free ringbuffers in JACK.  No point reinventing
the wheel...
I think it's a bit strange that the disk IO issue comes up so often in
these RT discussions, it's something of a red herring, because there's
rarely an RT constraint in getting the data to disk; the RT constraint
is in getting the data from the device to memory.
