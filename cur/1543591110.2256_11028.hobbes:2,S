Yes, it can be a security trap as well - physically move a card and
your firewall rules end up being applied to the wrong connection.
The 2.4 kernel allows you to rename an interface.  So you can build
a little database of (MAC address/name) pairs. Apply this after booting
and before bringing up the interfaces and everything has the name
you wanted, based on MAC address.
Andi Kleen has an app which does this:
	
ftp://ftp.firstfloor.org/pub/ak/smallsrc/nameif.c
but apparently some additional kernel work is needed to make
this work 100% correctly.  I do not know what the specific
problem is.
