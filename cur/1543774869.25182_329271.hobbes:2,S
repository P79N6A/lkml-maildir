I think for most people on the reiser-fs list, the '...' directory
represents an interface to many things including
- automatic aggregating/tar/untar/compress
- a different interface to stat data
- adding extended attributes/substreams/acls/etc.
- anything else you might imagine
(I think this is your understanding too?  Just double-checking.)
So some of that stuff would be separate from the file.  (Separate in the
sense that it's not generated from the file's binary data.)
Personally, I don't like it all being in one directory, but it's not
that important.

I think those breakages are acceptable.  (IMHO) In other words, I think
it would not occur very often without the user being aware of it, and
should very rarely result in catastrophic effects.
One other minor annoyance is it isn't easy to go backwards from the
... directory to the file.  e.g. if I have a symlink that points to
/attr/fs/2/92036, I don't know what file's attributes that refers to.
Hopefully I'm sane enough to give the symlink a descriptive enough
name...

Agreed.  Ultimately, it's the user's decision where to put it, but
probably 99.99999% of all people will put it in the same place.  Just
like you could put procfs or sysfs somewhere other than /proc or /sys if
you really wanted to, but nobody does that.

One other issue is that the attrfs/metafs needs to communicate with the
other filesystem somehow.  It needs to know if the filesystem can handle
storing of extended attributes/substreams/etc. so that it knows whether
or not to allow those interfaces.  In my
/attr/fs/$(getattrpath /attr/fs/$(getattrpath ~/foo)/thumbnail)/mimetype
example, it needs to be smart enough to store that in ~/foo's
filesystem.  etc.
