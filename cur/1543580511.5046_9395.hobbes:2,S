yea i know. . same mode       i also had a big problem with DMA timeouts on
2.4 so  .. i dont know what's up with 2.4 and my motherboard ...    2.2
hasn't shown a single irq or DMA error yet since going back to it.
currently 2.2.19-pre7 is using UDMA4     i just flashed the bios today so ..
hopefully that should have fixed any problems.  I get 24MB/s each according
to hdparm -t   on my hdd's and both are on the same channel.   This is much
better than i ever got with 2.4 even when only one drive was on a channel.
Right now my k7-2 750 is at 849mhz with a FSB of 114Mhz and PCI at 34Mhz.
my nbench performance under 2.2 is comparable to results for 1Ghz t-bird's so
i'm happy with 2.2.  The only thing that would make me want to upgrade would
be latency patches.  I'm convinced 2.4 has performance issues so i guess i'll
be using 2.2 until 2.5 begins.      Is it really only 1 or 2 people having
this Via corruption problem?   i doubt it's a bios problem because wouldn't
2.2 be effected by a bios bug if 2.4 is?   In either case the changelogs dont
show any  fixes for it.
