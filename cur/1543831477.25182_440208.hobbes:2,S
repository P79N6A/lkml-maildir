Yes, the TSC is a very poor clocksource. Although its high resolution
and very quick access time makes it hard to quit.

Hmmm. Thats an interesting observation. Let me look to see if maybe
something is going oddly in the settimeofday() path.

No bets here, but please let us know if you see any change in behavior.
