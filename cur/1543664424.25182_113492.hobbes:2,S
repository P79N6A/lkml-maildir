With the changes I've made, which I'm starting to merge with Pavel, I
think the two are a lot closer to each other.
With regard to quiescing the system, we need the same things stopped
that you need. We can of course use drivers_suspend when you can't, but
we could probably also use the SMP code you have.
I've got swsusp so that freeing memory is not necessary - the whole
image can be written to disk. There is still an option for the user to
aim for a smaller image (a soft limit can be set), and if there's not
enough swap available, that will also cause some memory to be freed, but
LKCD would run into that problem writing to swap too.

Nigel
