Can you give me a hint as to what I might be able to
do to modify it and fix it?  I'm not an expert in C
coding, but I can mill my way around... I can
understand why such a patch may be left out of the
mainstream kernel, but I wouldn't mind applying it in
my case.
Just for some more info on the problem.  I did some
more reboots last night, and I did get the 'eject sr0'
to work once. I then pressed the CD back in and tried
the eject again, and froze up hard.  no Oops that
time.  So it works intermittently.
Thanks for your prompt reply.
Regards,
Toby
