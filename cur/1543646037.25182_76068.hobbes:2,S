Hi!
i had the same problem with loadlin and kernel 2.5.40. I searched around in 
the web for the sources of loadlin (to add some debug output) and came 
accros:
http://sunsite.ulatina.ac.cr/Unix/Linux/Slackware/slackware-8.1/source/a/loadlin/update-1.6c/
This version of loadlin boots up 2.5.40 very well for me.
cu,
  Emmy
