We simply forget to initialize scb->sg_count in the non use_sg
case, so if the previous usage of that scb has sg_count==AHC_NSEGS
then we'd hit that panic erroneously.  Here is the fix below.
"It can't possibly be my driver, something broke in some Linux
subsystem which is making my driver break", sheesh get over it
