Alas, it does not help :(. I tried 2.5.71-mm1 too, since there has been
ACPI updates - still the same, but I just realised my problem might be
related to the conspicuous drop in size of the initrd image created by
mkinitrd (on Red Hat 9):
2.4.20: 143K
2.5.69-mm8: 288K
2.5.70/1-mmX: 84K
It turns out that the 'insmod' binary is much smaller (down from 300+K
to 100+K), but that should not matter, since modules still load
properly?
Bizarre... anyone else has 2.5.70 and above working on a Centrino
notebook on a Red Hat system? 2.5.71 has a sweet Enhanced SpeedStep
module that finally detects Centrino, now if only I could get it working
properly...
Thanks,
Michel
