what I meant is that cfq_set_request() calls a few inlines that also
take locks so it might be one of those instead

this is fine for lockdep IF and only IF there is no "out lock" held
around this that requires irqs to be off. So if you do
spin_lock_irqsave(lock1, flags);
...
spin_lock_irqsave(lock2, flags);
spin_unlock_irq(lock2)
...
then lockdep WILL complain, and rightfully so, about a violation since
lock1 gets violated here ;)
