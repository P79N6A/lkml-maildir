 	Hello All ,  Has anyone else had an occurance of this hard lockup .
 	last time it was the scsi bus that was the last item on the console this 
time it's  CPU #3 ...
 	Everytime I try & run a bonnie on this system something locks the system 
up hard .  I do not trust this system at this time & need to put it into 
production soon .
 	Anybody any pointers    where to look , ... ?
Kernel: Linux 2.6.21-rc7 ,  unpatched .
