Funny tha you mention this, I just chopped this out yesterday; its cruft
left over from back-when.
The reason I chopped this out is due to a bug regarding the handling 
of multi-function devices with the "new style" firmware interfaces.
With the new interfaces (i.e. those using ibm,get-config-addr-info),
every function on a pci card is labelled as a "partitionable endpoint".
By contrast, the current code assumes a "PE" is associated with a pci
card. As a result of this mismatch, the handling of multi-function
cards on systems with the new-style firmware is flubbed. (In particular,
the setup and use of config-space is muffed, resulting in crashes due
to access of i/o space that wasn't correctly set up). 
I'm trying several different approaches to fixing this.
1) consolidating multiple pci functions (multiple PE's) into a single 
   "pci card" and treating the thing as a unit.
2) Treating each PE as completely distinct, and handling each distinctly.
Each approach seems to have problems. Cross my fingers, hope to have 
something working later today; however, I'm irritated that I even need 
to solve his problem.
