Due to this stall kevent inclusion into lighttpd CVS tree is postponed.
The last version will be released saturday or sunday, and looking into
overhelming flow of feedback comments on this feature, project will not
be released to linux-kernel@, after this I will
complete netchannels support and start kevent based AIO project - mostly
network AIO with new design, which is based on set of entities, which
can describe set of tasks which should be performed
asynchronously (from user point of view, although read and write
obviously must be done after open and before close), for example syscall
which gets as parameter destination socket and local filename (with
optional offset and length fields), which will asynchronously from user
point of view open a file and transfer requested part to the destination
socket and then return opened file descriptor (or it can be closed if
requested). Similar mechanism can be done for read/write calls.
Interested parties will be able to apply patches for theirs own kernels.
