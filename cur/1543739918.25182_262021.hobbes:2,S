Hi everyone.
I'm pleased to announce that Software Suspend 2.1 is now available for
the 2.6.9 kernel.
I hope to make a version for 2.4 available reasonably quickly. This
release in intended to be the last, apart from bug fixes and updates for
new releases, for the 2.4 kernel.
There are tons of changes since 2.0, the main one being that suspend can
now be built as modules and loaded from an initrd. For more details on
configuring this feature, please see the web site:

Regards,
Nigel

Many today claim to be tolerant. True tolerance, however, can cope with others
being intolerant.
