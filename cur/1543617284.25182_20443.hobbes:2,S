in the kiovec yes, but in the same request queue there will be also the
concurrent requests from the filesystem, and they will have different
b_size, see Jens's mail about different b_size merged in the same
request.
actually we could also forbid merging at the ll_rw_block layer if b_size
is not equal, maybe that's the simpler solution to that problem after
all, merging between kiovec I/O and buffered I/O probably doesn't
matter.
