It seems this staircase scheduler has some strange interactions with
networking and PM suspend. I can't suspend my laptop when any program is
using the network and, what's more, after the suspend mechanism fails,
the program that was using the network stays stuck at D state and can't
be killed.
I can trigger this with evolution 1.4.8 using an IMAP mail account, or
simply by launching Konqueror, pointing it to a URL and then try
suspending while Konqueror is retrieving the page from Internet.
I'm open to suggestions.
