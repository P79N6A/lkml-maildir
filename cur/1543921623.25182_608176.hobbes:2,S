Ah, yes. That is probably better. We don't need to do the second pull if
the idle_balance is run. Thanks.

On wakeup, we can wake up several RT tasks (as my test case does) and if
we only push one task, then the other tasks may not migrate over to the
other run queues. I logged this happening in my tests.
The pull happens when we lower our priority in the scheduler. So we only
pull when we lower the priority since the push of rt tasks would not
push to a rq of higher priority. A waiting rt task may be able to run as
soon as we lower our priority. The only reason we pull more than one is
to cover the race between finding the highest prio runqueue, and having
that still be the highest task on the run queue when we go to pull it.
Although, I admit there are still races here. But hopefully the pushes
cover them.
We then again push on finish_task_switch, simply because we may need to
push the previous running task. On wake up and schedule, we can't push a
running task, so a rt task may wake up a higher priority rt task on the
same CPU as it is running, so when the higher priority rt task preempts
the current rt task, we want to push that current rt task off to another
CPU if possible. The first time this is possible is from
finish_task_switch when that current rt task is no longer running.
I'm currently working on getting RT overload logic to use cpusets, for
better NUMA and large CPU handling. So some of this logic will change in
the next series.
