I remember looking at this a while back. I think the corrected information
is only being propagated to the 'vendor' file, and the write_config_word
isn't actually updating the 'config' entry in sysfs.
If you remove the "#if 0" from lib/sysfs.c in pciutils, it should
start reporting the corrected value in base lspci, etc.
