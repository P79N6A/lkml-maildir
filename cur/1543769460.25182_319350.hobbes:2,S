Um... I would think the real fix is to set the UART up to generate the modem 
status interrupt and eliminate the pole loop.  Why can't this be done?  I, for 
one, don't want my cpu looping in the serial driver, even more so with the 
interrupt system off.  This, in my mind, is a real bug in the serial driver and 
should be so handled.
