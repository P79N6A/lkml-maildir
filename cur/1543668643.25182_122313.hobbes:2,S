I don't see that as a big hole at all.  While we're in page_convert_anon,
yes, page_referenced won't find all the ptes and try_to_unmap won't be
able to unmap them all; but there are plenty of other reasons why a page
may be briefly unfreeable even though try_to_unmap succeeded, it'll just
try again later.
I haven't really had my think yet, but the only difficulty I've seen so
far is in maintaining the nr_mapped stats correctly.  page_convert_anon
insert an initial dummy entry (the entry install_page is about to add?)
to make sure page_mapped cannot go false?
(Hmm, is the current page_convert_anon maintaining nr_reverse_maps
correctly?  I would think not, since it's doing nothing about it, and
page_remove_rmap would decrement seeing an Anon.  But perhaps I'm
confused again, a quick test doesn't show the drop I'd expect.)
