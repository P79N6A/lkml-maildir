Thanks: that is consistent with ramfs, seems correct and does no harm.
Though I don't think it affects anything than the fsnotify_inoderemove
i_nlink test in dentry_iput.  I'm a little surprised by that test,
unqualified to say whether that's the right place and way to make an
inoderemove test; but even if it were not, I'd be silly to reject
your fix.  Thanks, I'll sign it off and send it onwards.
