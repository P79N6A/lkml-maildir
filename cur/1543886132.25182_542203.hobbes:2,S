Your device has more than one LED. Do you need to be able to configure
each LED individually or can they all have the same default settings?

"struct timer_list timer" in "struct timer_trig_data" is unused when its
used for a default_trigger_data which is wasted space.

You don't check default_trigger == "timer" before using
default_trigger_data.
Imagine we have:
struct led_classdev landisk_leds = {
       .name = "power",
       .default_trigger = "bitshift",
       .default_trigger_data =&default_bitshift_trig_data,
};
where:
struct bitshift_trig_data {
       unsigned long single_variable;
};
If you then:
echo "timer" > /sys/class/leds/power/trigger
your patch will use random data and possibly oops.
