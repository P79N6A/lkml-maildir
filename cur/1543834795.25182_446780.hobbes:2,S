Oops. Run ran with RT_MUTEX_DEBUG_ON on SMP? I only ran it without 
RT_MUTEX_DEBUG_ON on UP. I did compile it for SMP though, but I don't have 
any SMP machine :-(
I'll merge your compile fix into patch 3 and try again.
I am using quilt and pine to send it with so I wonder why I keep getting 
the white-space damage. Shouldn't emacs fix the 8 space vs tabs things 
when I switch the c-style to linux? You probably don't use emacs....
