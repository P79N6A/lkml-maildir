Got it... I wasn't thinking that clearly, but it is clear that a full
4-tuple collision with only active connections is quite unlikely.  I
guess you would have to make both an offloaded and a non-offloaded
iSCSI connection to the same target and get really unlucky with
ephemeral port allocation.  So in practice I guess it's not an issue
at all with your driver yet.
However, do you have any plans to support iSCSI offload for targets?
Also, looking at the first CNIC patch, I can't help but notice that
you seem to have at least some support for iWARP there.  How does the
CNIC look?  Does it share the same interface/addresses as the
non-offload NIC, or does it create a completely separate netdevice?
I want to make sure that whatever solution we come up with for cxgb3
doesn't cause problems for you.  And of course if you have a better
idea than what Steve has come up with, that would be great :)
