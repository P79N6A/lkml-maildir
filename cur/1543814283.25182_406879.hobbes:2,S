Few problems which I have noticed so far.
- Many printk() warnings. Wherever start and end are being printed,
  the format specifier being used is %lx. Needs to be changed to %Lx.
- Some folks save a pointer of type (unsigned long *) to start and end field
  and then try to operate on it. This pointer type shall have to be changed
  to something like u64*.
	unsigned long *port, *end, *tport, *tend;
	port = &dev->res.port_resource[idx].start;
- Some folks cast "start" to a pointer and then use it. Compiler gives warning. 
	addr_reg = (void __iomem *) addr->start;
