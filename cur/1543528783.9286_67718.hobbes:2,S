I agree it's a good idea to change USB ACM.  Probably the USB serial
driver needs to be changed too.
It's nasty that you have to find this in PPP -- the USB ACM driver is
just a fancy serial driver and shouldn't have to know about PPP to get
right the undocumented details of which functions can be called in which
contexts.
I wouldn't be surprised if there are other serial drivers with the same
bug, but nobody noticed.  Or arguably it's a bug in PPP.  I'd really
whoever designed the tty layer to define what each side of the interface
may assume.
