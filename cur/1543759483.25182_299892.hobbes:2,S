Hi Adrian,
bmcsensors package (reading hardware sensors provided by intel boards
via ipmi) used to work fine with 2.6.10; no longer works with 2.6.11
because of removal of the ipmi_request function (+ exported symbol).
correct fix would be to use ipmi_request_settime with retries=-1 and
retry_time_ms=0?
Thanks, Martin
