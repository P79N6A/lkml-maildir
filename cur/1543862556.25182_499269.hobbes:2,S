Hi,
Tim Ryan has reported the following bug at the Gentoo bugzilla:
https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162199
His home dir is mounted over NFS. 2.6.18 worked OK but 2.6.19 is very 
slow to load the desktop environment. NFS is suspected here as the 
problem does not exist for users with local homedirs. This might not be 
a straightforward performance issue as it does seem to perform OK on the 
console.
The bug still exists in unpatched 2.6.20-rc5.
Is this a known issue? Should we report a new bug on the kernel bugzilla?
Thanks,
Daniel
