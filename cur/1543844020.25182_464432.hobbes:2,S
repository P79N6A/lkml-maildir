Actually, 486 DX had built-in FPU as well. It was missing from 486SX
(486SX + optional 487 FPU = 486DX).
For 386(DX|SX) there were 387(DX|SX) (386SX used 16-bit bus).
Many 32-bit motherboards had a socket for Weitek (3167 for 386DX or 4167
for 486). I think I remember a board with 386DX and 287 socket as well.
486DX2 meant the external clock was half the internal.
