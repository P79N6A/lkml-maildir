Linus.
a = val >> shift 
for 64 bits divides and
a = val >> shift;
b = val - (a << shift) 
for 64 bit modulo operations 
seem to be the cleanest and lowest overhead way for this and these were 
provided by folks on the list in response to this thread.  I have
already incorporated them and the code builds fine.  I have not
disassembled it to see how many instructions this is taking but I only
do 64-bit math infrequently, so it should be minimal.
(Thanks everyone who helped out here).
