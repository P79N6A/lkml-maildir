hmmm, there appears to be a problem with the fat or vfat driver. Im
using Windows 2000 on a different hard drive which is using FAT32 for
the filesystem.
When I rebooted into Win2k the system did not detect a corrupt FAT.
Im going to compile 2.2.19ac3 today and see if this was a known issue or
not.
I dont know what information I can give you other then what the log
shows.
Thanks,
Shawn Starr.
