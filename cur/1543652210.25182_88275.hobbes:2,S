Most PIII Coppermine notebooks only have ACPI 1.x which does not include
"Performance States" - an interface to Intel SpeedStep and other, similar 
technologies. And when there is a working "Performance States" support in
ACPI, this itself registered as cpufreq driver and then there's no need for 
the legacy speedstep driver. So, no, unfortunately your suggestion doesn't 
solve the problem.
