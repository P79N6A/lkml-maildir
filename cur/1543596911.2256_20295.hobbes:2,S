    The bit that I had automated was to essentially fix each and every
low-level SCSI driver such that each low-level driver would be responsible
for it's own locking.  At this point the patches and the tool are on hold -
once the 2.5 kernel series gets underway, I can generate some fairly massive
patchsets.
