Yep, that's where I got the idea for this (seems no-one did the
same for the 2.6 tree). Here's the one-liner..
 
find ${1:-.} -name "*.c"    -type f | xargs grep -En '![a-zA-Z0-9_ ]+(\|[^|]|\&[^&])|([^|]\||[^&]\&) *!' | grep -v SCCS
As well as the misplaced brackets, it also catches if (foo & bar) where && was
probably intended (ditto | instead of ||).
It does miss some cases though. Whereas this..
find ${1:-.} -name "*.c"    -type f | xargs grep -En 'if[\ ]\(' | grep -v SCCS | grep \)[\ ]\[\|\&][\ ]  
turns up a few more, but also a lot more false positives.
And if you think the number of bugs it turned up in the kernel is
unfunny, you should see the results when you run it on a source tree
of an unpacked distro. It's Un-be-lievable how common this problem is.
It's not every week you get to do patches to ~80 projects in 3 days 8-)
I tried coming up with some regexps for other 'stupid errors',
things like
	if (foo);
		bar 
or the likes, I got 1-2 real hits out of zillions of lines of code
as opposed to the few dozen misplaced brackets and '|' instead of '||'
Fun.
