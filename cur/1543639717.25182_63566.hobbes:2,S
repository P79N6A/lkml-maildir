use a procmail scoring filter, case sensitive, and score a la:
* 5^6 ([nN]igeria|[Aa]bacha|[zZ]imbabwe|[mM]ugabe)
* 10^6 (MUGABE|MILLION|DOLLARS|NIGERIA|ABACHA|ZIMBABWE)
most of my mail will start with a default score of at least -50. and
above catches 90ish% of 419 spam to me. no reason why spamassassin
couldnt do this too. (presuming it has weighted scoring like
procmail).
[paul@fogarty tmp]$ wc -l ~/.procspam
    493 /home/paul/.procspam
and i plan to add the multi-k lines nl.linux.org anti-spam regexps to 
it some time too. :)
