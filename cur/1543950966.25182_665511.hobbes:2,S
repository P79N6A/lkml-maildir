Two reasons:
a) the existing macros are (I believe) a right royal pita.  It's very
   hard to remember which order the args are supposed to be in.
   So each time I see a time_foo() when reviewing a patch I have to go
   off and re-read the implementation then have a big think to check that
   they got it right (a sure sign of a poor interface, no)?
   And I'm not the only one - people get this wrong fairly regularly.
b) around 90% of the usages of time_after() are to compare against jiffies!
The macros which Dave is developing aren't just less-error-prone,
easier-to-review transformations - they offer higher-level functionality.
Because time_after() is just a basic comparison operation, whereas
time_now_before() is an *application* of that operation.
Trust me on this - they will lead to easier-to-review code and less bugs.

They are hard to use and hard to review.
