No, you are right, they do not, right now.
Is dir_notify suitable for inotify and your uses?  In the 10 months of
inotify development, I had hoped that a remote filesystem developer
would add support so we could test it.  But there is no rush to get this
hook added, so its okay.
The problem with dir_notify is that the args parameter is dnotify flags.
Those don't map directly to inotify flags.
What I'd like is
	(a) a patch adding the requisite inotify hook (really, 4 lines)
	(b) a filesystem successfully using the hook

It is a system call, now.  ;-)

Nod.
