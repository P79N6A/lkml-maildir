No. The things are much simpler. If socket is on timer,
it means that someone refers to it. Until this someone will release
it (and it can be made only under kernel lock),
timer will not able to destroy it.
Do you understand? Timer is pure gc collector, it
destroys only sockets, which are not referenced by anyone.
If unix_gc was able to find this socket, it is in use
and timer will not destroy it until someone (f.e. unix_gc itself)
will release it.
