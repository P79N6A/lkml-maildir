Hmm, you can garner this from the local_t stats which were flying around.
(see Re: local_add_return from me), or look in the preamble to
http://ozlabs.org/~rusty/kernel/rr-latest/misc

Of course, if you want to be my hero, you could implement "soft" irq
disable for all archs, which would make this cheaper.

Maybe kill local_t and take the name back.  I'll leave it to you...

That would have been cool, but no; first time in 76 years they matched tho.
Thanks,
