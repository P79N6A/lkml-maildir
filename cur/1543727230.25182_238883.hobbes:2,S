It's only if I physically try and create such a test application that I can 
reproduce it. I haven't found any real world load that does that - but of 
course that doesn't mean I should discount it. However, interactive mode off 
doesn't exhibit it and it should be easy enough to fix for interactive mode 
on. Thanks for pointing it out.
