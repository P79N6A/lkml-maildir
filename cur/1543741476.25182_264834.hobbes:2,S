Hello,
You are right. I tried now to install SLES 8 (32bit) and the system 
hangs when initialising CPU0. Our running pre-production sample was 
installed from the same CD and with exactly the same setup.
So something is really broken in the final bios or in the final board 
layout.
The only thing I haven't tried is to flash the pre-production bios on the 
final boards.
Bye,
