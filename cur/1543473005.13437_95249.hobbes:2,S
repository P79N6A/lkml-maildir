Synopsis:  over approximately 6-12 hours, a GRE ipip tunnel decays,
silently failing when transmitting packets.
The two servers for endpoints of the tunnel are james[207.213.0.47] and
midnight[dynamic].
Descriptions:
   james: has two ethernet cards and acts as a simple router for several
          devices to include standard /25 and smaller subnets, a vpn over
          a GRE tunnel, and a vpn over ssh+pppd.
          2.1.131ac11, amdk6-233, 192megs, pgcc-2.91.60
midnight: has one dialup modem and one network card.  acts as the router
          for a subnet sourced from the GRE tunnel, used to employ the
          ssh+pppd solution.
          2.1.131ac11, amdk6-233, 128megs, pgcc-2.91.60
eth0 is the network card going to the world
eth1 is the network card for subnets
gre1 is the GRE IPIP tunnel
ppp0 is the ssh+pppd vpn
the following are routed to james:
 207.213.0.47
 207.213.14.0/24    (lower half tunneled, upper half not used except for endpoints)
 207.213.15.0/25,25 (lower half exists as aliases on eth0, upper half
                     spread on eth1 and vpns)
207.213.15.129 is used for transport endpoints of the tunnels because of
the nature of unreachability of that ip for hosts not on the router.
 [internet] -> james[eth0:207.213.0.47]   -> [eth0:subnet:207.213.15.0/25]
                                          -> [eth1]
                    [eth1:207.213.15.129] -> [eth1:10baseT hub subnets]
                                          -> [eth1:ppp0:207.213.15.241]
                                          -> [gre1:207.213.14.130]
                    [ppp0:207.213.15.241:207.213.15.243]  (ssh works ok,
                                                          just slow and has
                                                          a few peculiarities)
                    [gre1:207.213.14.130(l):207.213.14.131(r)]  carries 14.0/25 subnet
 [internet] -> midnight[ppp0:dynamic]     -> eth0:207.213.14.2, 207.213.14.7]
                                          -> eth0:10baseT subnet:207.213.14.0/25]
                                          -> [gre1]
                    [gre1:207.213.14.131(l):207.213.14.130(r)]  carries 14.0/25 subnet

Timeline:
      reboot of james:  everything works fine
  several hours later: SMTP connections cease to 207.213.14.2, ssh will work.
                       ssh works for a while because it binds to a local
                       socket before attempting to connect.  a telnet to
                       port 25 results in the following:
            connect(3, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(25),
            sin_addr=inet_addr("207.213.14.2")}, 16 <unfinished ...>
                       if i use ssh instead of telnet, the bind happens,
                       then the connect succeeds.  this is ONLY from james
                       to midnight.  connections from midnight will always
                       succeed throughout this entire process.  (this may
                       simply be the number of packets processed by each
                       machine)
   a few hours later:  connect() fails more.  ssh now fails. the bind no
                       longer helps.  all connects silently fail.
    a few more hours:  connect() starts returning out of buffer space
                       errors.

tearing down the GRE tunnel and restablishing it in exactly proper order
appears to fix things.  this procedure is not guaranteed and several
times, james has to be rebooted.
as a side note, with 2.1.132pre4 on james, the GRE tunnel would establish
but would not transfer packets in either direction.  i will attempt
2.1.132 full (and 133+) this evening.  the exact same kernel is being run
on both machines with the only difference being one is using a mylex scsi
card, the other a fireport.  both have tulip cards in them with tulip
version .90.  if GRE tunneling is not employed, networking remains stable.
please let me know what further information is desired.
