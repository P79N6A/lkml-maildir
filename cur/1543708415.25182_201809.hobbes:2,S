I think we were talking about absolute branches when referring to "near 
branches".  For absolute branches, having a 32-bit address restricts you 
to the lower 4G of the address space.
For long mode on AMD64, default operand size for _relative_ branch is 32 
bits.  I get the impression that the size of the relative branch operand 
is handled differently from the "segment default word size".
