As long as you _must_ map the HPET before ioremap() is working,
and you also must have a permanent mapping, then grabbing a fixmap
page is IMO the cleanest solution. This is for example how the
local APIC mapping is handled. boot/bt ioremap are as you noticed
for temporary mappings only.
However, dynamically migrating the timer to HPET after mem_init()
would be even better, since that avoids the problem altogether.
