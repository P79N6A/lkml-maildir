Sorry if the descriptions here are misleading. This is basically an
attempt to have the kernel keep preconstructed pagetables around so
that the bitblitting hits need not be repetitively taken during fork()
and faults, where counterarguments revolve around whether this is
actually a hit at all and whether it's significant. It's not related to
the transparent quasi-ASID/ASN affairs AMD has based on %cr3 contents.
