The problem is it was made implicit long ago.  The design is "optimistic", so
to speak, and I think we have the following choices:
1) Change the design to make the kernel refuse to suspend if there are any
drivers not explicitly flagged as "suspend/resume-safe".  [This looks like a
lot of work to me, but it is generally doable provided that someone has enough
time to do it.  Unfortunately it has to be done in one shot for all of the
known good drivers to avoid user-observable regressions.]
2) Require the authors of new drivers to _either_ ensure that their drivers
will be suspend/resume-safe (and I mean both STR and STD here), _or_ explicitly
flag the drivers as "suspend/resume-unsafe", for example by impelenting
.suspend() routines returning -ENOSYS.  [The existing drivers can be modified
to follow this convention gradually.]
Now IMO 1) has some disadvantages:
- Potential for introducing some regressions (eg. if we omit a known-good
driver)
- Necessity to review a lot of drivers simultaneously
- Problem what to do with drivers that work for some people and don't work
for the others (ie. if we don't flag them as known good, we will break the
setups in which they work)
The advantage of 1), however, is that we can differentiate drivers that are
safe only with respect to the suspend to disk from those that are safe with
respect to the suspend to RAM too (there are some).
I'd prefer 2), because it's simpler to make happen.

Rafael
