I just now tried out *only* "the other SCSI suspend patch",
and by itself it hangs on resume.  Laptop computer, blank screen,
no serial ports, no printk()s visible.
And there's one minor bug in that patch:  it uses GFP_KERNEL to
alloc a buffer, but on resume it really should use GFP_ATOMIC instead,
since the swap device is the same drive we're trying to resume..

That's probably why it hangs when used as-is by itself.
I may do some further testing.
Anyone else out there playing with this yet?
