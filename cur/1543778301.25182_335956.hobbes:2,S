Then we should probably not try to force them into driver model. Have
parent device register struct device and when sub-drivers register
they could attach class devices (like input devices) directly to the
"main" device thus hiding presence of sub-sections of the chip from
sysfs completely. My point is that we should not be using
class_interface here - its purpose is diferent.
