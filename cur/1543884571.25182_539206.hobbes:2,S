No, the timeslice l_i here serves as a granularity control w.r.t 
responsiveness (or latency depends on how you interpret it). As wli said 
it can be express as a function of the priority, as we do for weight 
now. It is not related with the length of each new request. A request 
may be 1 seconds long, but the scheduler may still process it using 10ms 
timeslice. Smaller timeslice leads to more accuracy, i.e. closer to 
ideal case.
However, the maximum of timeslice l_i used by all active tasks 
determines the total responsiveness of the system, which I will explain 
in detail later.

Consider if p3 is a newly started task or waked up task and carries no 
p->wait_runtime.
