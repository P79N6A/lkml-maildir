I have logged this in bugzilla for some times, but didn't had
time to go deeper (

About the "control queue full", Vojtech once made a patch  (I should still have
it somewhere. If you want to test it, tell me so...)
Lastly, the best way to report is still to mail to usd-users and usb-devel
lists. Otherwise, the above mentionned Linux' bugzilla is a good way too.
