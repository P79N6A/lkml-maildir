I'm honestly not sure that using an ASCII string in an xattr is the sane 
way of doing this.  Even a binary byte in an xattr would make more sense 
in some ways.
I think the xattr mechanism is ignored largely because it's painfully 
complex.
A plus with using xattr is that in theory (but of course not in 
practice!) it would let one store a copy of a DOS filesystem on an ext3 
(or xfs, or...) filesystem and have it restored, all using standard (but 
by necessity, xattr-aware) tools.  However, the splitting of xattr into 
namespaces may very well make that impossible, since what's a "system" 
attribute to one filesystem is a "user" attribute to another.  Classic 
design flaw, by the way.
Anyway, I'm going to send out something to the various maintainers of 
DOS-based filesystems (FAT, CIFS, NTFS) and see what they think.
