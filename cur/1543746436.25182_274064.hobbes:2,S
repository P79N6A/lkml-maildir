This is actually not really of topic, so so much for getting shunted.
Anyway:
If you edit the modules part (manuals enough on the internet, watch your 
kernel version, because modules changed a bit between 2.4 and 2.6 kernels), 
you can force the identifier of your card to be matched with a CF device. 
Take the best matching device. 
If you don't have any match at all, you have a problem, i.e. it will not work.
I don't know the Zaurus (except from a nice picture), so I don't know what 
kind of port is used for the CF card (IDE? PCMCIA? other?). If it is an IDE 
port, it should work at once. It does not need any other information.
For the rest it sounds to me like you are doing a hardware hack. 
Regards,
Norbert
