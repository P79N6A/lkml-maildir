The Ext2+ crowd is actively working on preparing for the world of larger 
blocks, so that 64KB blocks will be entirely practical.  This will get us to 
1/4 Petabyte, still with 32 bit block pointers internally.  The main problem 
that has to be solved is internal fragmentation.
Going beyond 64KB blocks with mimimal changes is possible too, basically just 
working around the 16 bit pointers in directory blocks.  However, it's not 
clear it's a pressing need.

Right, there's still a lot more scalability to be squeezed out of good old 32 
bits.  If we do run out of something it's likely to be the 32 bits of inodes, 
after all, who can get by on a mere 4 billion files these days?
