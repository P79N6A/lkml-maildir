[ Clarification: here "module" is not just "the thing you insert with
  insmod". In RTAI it's a mlock'ed user-level thing that has higher
  priority than the kernel, and can thus trivially crash the system.
  Whether it runs in CPL0 or CPL3 is immaterial at that point - a crash is
  a crash, and I'm not interested in systems where I cannot debug the
  thing that caused it ]
