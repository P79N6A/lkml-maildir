It does change things in a substantial way. Namely, the lower address
space boundary doesn't exist in mainline at all, and so its enforcement
requires introduction. Furthermore, mainline must concern itself with
all Linux-supported architectures (not distro-supported architectures),
not just ia32/x86-64, so there is also FIRST_USER_PGD_NR to take into
account as opposed to pulling magic ia32/x86-64 -specific numbers out
of a hat and splattering them all over core code. Not that you had
anything to do with any of this.
