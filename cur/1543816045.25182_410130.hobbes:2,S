If it's considered "low-end" it's because people actually uses that
memory for something and the system starts swapping, not because it's
trendy.
The "powerful machines who never swaps" are always a minority. Being geeks
as we are we try to have the greatest machine possible, but the vast majority
of real users are "underpowered" I'm not talking of pentium 1 stuff, I can bet
there're far more pentium 4 machines with 256 MB out there than with 1 GB.
I know you don't hit those problems because you use expensive machines
with lots of ram ;) But in the _real_ world, lots of the machines are
already wasting most of its ram by running the desktop environment alone.

into swapping easily by using desktop apps and could benefit from
better page replacement policies)
