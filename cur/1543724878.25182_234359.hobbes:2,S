wrong mailing list, sort of.
use google to look up SCHED_FIFO, which will lead you into the
wonderful of soft-RT programming on POSIX operating systems. 
lots of people (including me) do this sort of thing already. but be
warned: linux is not a hard-RT OS, and cannot become so. if you are
doing data acquisition for critical data or systems, you might want to
consider RT-Linux or RTAI or other hard-RT variants.
