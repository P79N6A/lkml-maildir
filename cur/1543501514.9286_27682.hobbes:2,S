It's either non-transparancy _or_ the exclusion of one of
both access methods to non-albod-aware apps.
If we make it non-transparent (maybe with some magic required
from the user), we can at least grant the user the possibility
of accessing the albod as a file _and_ as a directory.
I don't know what you want, but I take flexibility over
newbie-friendlyness every day...
