I'll have to disagree with what you're saying, because:

They are being kept up to date, and aparently have been for some time.

Umm, and the difference between maintaining a set of patches per kernel
version and something using bitkeeper (or heaven forbid, CVS)?  Even
Linus didn't starting using source code management until somewhat
recently.

Have you seen 
http://lkcd.sf.net
 ?  They have that there.   I've
successfully walked through their well-written tutorials and produced
crashdumps from machines that have failed.

Perhaps people are but they're not posting the bugs to the list...

The data is there, perhaps not for Linux, but for other Unixes -
including ones like the BSDs.  Crashdumps are an invaluable resource for
finding bugs that involve things like hardware that doesn't conform
exactly to specs, or deadlocks, or...
