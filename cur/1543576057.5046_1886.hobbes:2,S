'ls -l' is useless, here.  Sure the device files exist, but bash is
telling you that, kernel-side, they are not connected to anything.
- Do you have emu10k1 compiled in, or as a module?
- Does your SBLive appear to have been detected?  (Check 'dmesg')
- If emu10k1 is a module, is the module loaded?  Does it seem to detect
  your SBLive when loaded?  (Again check 'dmesg')
