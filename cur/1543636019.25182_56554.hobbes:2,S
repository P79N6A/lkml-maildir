A small synthesizer is one of the things I am trying to work on.
After reading all the wonderful suggestions I've seen here on this
thread I'm not sure just how I'll fit it all together.  Key tones to
indicate when particular events have taken place with the pc's speaker
could be very useful.  We use the bell character to indicate the lilo
boot prompt currently.  It could be expanded to indicate a lot of
useful events if built-in to the BIOS.
A user space program to give access to the cmos bios settings is
another feature which would be very useful.  Currently there is no way
for a blind person to set up his/her own bios under the other O.S but
it could conceivably be done under Linux.
A few folks have written me suggesting the possibility of using the pc
speaker as the output for a low quality speech synth.  I am skeptical
about the feasability of this but it would give everyone blind or
otherwise useful feedback possibly on systems which are headless.  I
am not exactly sure yet just how small I can get a useable speech
synth.  That is the whole reason for this thread in the first place.

Is there an organized linuxbios project?  If so, could someone give me
a pointer please.
