I have to admit that 2.2.10 is somewhat better, yes.
Incoming connections seem to function properly, with data
coming in almost as fast as my modem allows.
Outgoing connections, though, still don't work the way they
should. At the moment, there's some 25 kb in the send queue
to a remote site and it just doesn't get sent.
That data's been in the queue for about 4 minutes now, without
anything getting sent. I wouldn't be surprised if I had to try
that particular connection up to three times before it succeeds
($$$ here in Europe).
Small outgoing packets to the pop3 server or to smtp servers
seem to work fine though -- it looks like the TCP stack is
only able to do one thing at a time and it processes stuff in
LIFO order (or in this case, FINO).
