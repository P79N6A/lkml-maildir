Not necessarily in that form. A lot of statistics has now become
per-cpu, something we wanted to achieve back then. Automatic
/proc reporting was an idea only tossed around, but /proc is now
deprecated for such things. There may be a need for fast export of 
counters to userspace, but those requirements are not yet clear.
This is different from per-task accounting infrastructure that
people are trying to develop.
Thanks
