while this probably it isnt exactly modest, i'd like to direct your
attention to the following SPEC benchmarks:
	
http://www.spec.org/osg/web99/results/res2000q2/
I cannot see any NetWare (or UnixWare) numbers there. Check out the 'TUX'
webserver at:
	
http://www.redhat.com/~mingo/TUX-patches/
which is an in-kernel webserver. So above you say TUX cannot exist because
it's too tough to debug and because "The entire Linux Network subsystem
needs an overhaul"? Why dont you actually let people decide wether they
want to apply the KDB patch for kernel development?
