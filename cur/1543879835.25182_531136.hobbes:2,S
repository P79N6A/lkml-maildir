Well a single run queue removes the need for load balancing but has 
scalability issues on large systems.  Personally, I think something in 
between would be the best solution i.e. multiple run queues but more 
than one CPU per run queue.  I think that this would be a particularly 
good solution to the problems introduced by hyper threading and multi 
core systems and also NUMA systems.  E.g. if all CPUs in a hyper thread 
package are using the one queue then the case where one CPU is trying to 
run a high priority task and the other a low priority task (i.e. the 
cases that the sleeping dependent mechanism tried to address) is less 
likely to occur.
By the way, I think that it's a very bad idea for the scheduling 
mechanism and the load balancing mechanism to be coupled.  The anomalies 
that will be experienced and the attempts to make ad hoc fixes for them 
will lead to complexity spiralling out of control.

I can't comment here as (as far as I can recall) I never saw your code 
and only became involved when Con posted his version of cpusched.

Yes, pragmatic considerations dictated a change of tack.

Yes, I went with the idea of intra run queue scheduling being orthogonal 
to load balancing for two reasons:
1. I think that coupling them is a bad idea from the complexity POV, and
2. it's enough of a battle fighting for modifications to one bit of the 
code without trying to do it to two simultaneously.

The main commercial plug in scheduler used with the run time loadable 
module scheduler that I mentioned earlier did gang scheduling (at the 
insistence of the Tru64 kernel folks).  As this scheduler was a 
hierarchical "fair share" scheduler: i.e. allocating CPU "fairly" 
("unfairly" really in according to an allocation policy) among higher 
level entities such as users, groups and applications as well as 
processes; it was fairly easy to make it a gang scheduler by modifying 
it to give all of a process's threads the same priority based on the 
process's CPU usage rather than different priorities based on the 
threads' usage rates.  In fact, it would have been possible to select 
between gang and non gang on a per process basis if that was considered 
desirable.
The fact that threads and processes are distinct entities on Tru64 and 
Solaris made this easier to do on them than on Linux.
My experience with this scheduler leads me to believe that to achieve 
gang scheduling and fairness, etc. you need (usage) statistics based 
schedulers.

spa_svr actually does its best work when the system isn't fully loaded 
as the type of improvement it strives to achieve (minimizing on queue 
wait time) hasn't got much room to manoeuvre when the system is fully 
loaded.  Therefore, the fact that it's 1% better even in these 
circumstances is a good result and also indicates that the overhead for 
keeping the scheduling statistics it uses for its decision making is 
well spent.  Especially, when you consider that the total available room 
for improvement on this benchmark is less than 3%.
To elaborate, the motivation for this scheduler was acquired from the 
observation of scheduling statistics (in particular, on queue wait time) 
on systems running at about 30% to 50% load.  Theoretically, at these 
load levels there should be no such waiting but the statistics show that 
there is considerable waiting (sometimes as high as 30% to 50%).  I put 
this down to "lack of serendipity" e.g.  everyone sleeping at the same 
time and then trying to run at the same time would be complete lack of 
serendipity.  On the other hand, if everyone is synced then there would 
be total serendipity.
Obviously, from the POV of a client, time the server task spends waiting 
on the queue adds to the response time for any request that has been 
made so reduction of this time on a server is a good thing(tm).  Equally 
obviously, trying to achieve this synchronization by asking the tasks to 
cooperate with each other is not a feasible solution and some external 
influence needs to be exerted and this is what spa_svr does -- it nudges 
the scheduling order of the tasks in a way that makes them become well 
synced.
Unfortunately, this is not a good scheduler for an interactive system as 
it minimizes the response times for ALL tasks (and the system as a 
whole) and this can result in increased response time for some 
interactive tasks (clunkiness) which annoys interactive users.  When you 
start fiddling with this scheduler to bring back "interactive 
unfairness" you kill a lot of its superior low overall wait time 
performance.
So this is why I think "horses for courses" schedulers are worth while.

If you look at the struct sched_spa_child in the file 
include/linux/sched_spa.h you'll see that the interface for switching 
between the various SPA schedulers is quite small and making them 
runtime switchable would be easy (I haven't done this in cpusched as I 
wanted to keep the same interface for switching schedulers for all 
schedulers: i.e. all run time switchable or none run time switchable; as 
the main aim of plugsched had become a mechanism for evaluating 
different intra queue scheduling designs.)

I'll probably stop looking at this problem as well at least for the time 
being until all this new code has settled.

PS As I no longer read LKML, I haven't yet seen Ingo's or Con's or 
Nick's new schedulers yet so am unable to comment on their technical 
merits with respect to my comments above.
