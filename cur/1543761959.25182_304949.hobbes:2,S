regarding this code:
void synchronize_kernel(void)
{
        long oldbatch;
        smp_mb();
        oldbatch = rcu_ctrlblk.batch;
        schedule_timeout(HZ/GRACE_PERIODS_PER_SEC);
what is the intent of that schedule_timeout() - a fixed-period delay? Is
that acceptable? In any case, it wont do what you think it does, you
should use mdelay(), or do current->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE -
otherwise the call will just return when we are in TASK_RUNNING.
