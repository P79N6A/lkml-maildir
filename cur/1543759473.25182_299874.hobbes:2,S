Sorry, I'm just on the end of this thread but I wanted to put in my 2 bits,
I was maintaining this type of tree for 2.4 before.  It was well received by
those who used it and it was stable (ssssh, I'm still running that puppy on
a couple well hidden 7.2 servers).
The key then was to only put in patches that fixed issues.  If it was a hard
factual solution to a problem then it went into the patch.  BTW, it was just
that, a patch (or set of patches) not actually a seperate tree.  It was
completely focused on stability as that's what I needed for work at the
time.

It was good for 2.4 and I think for 2.6, the legitimacy (coming from the top
down) will be a good thing.  It wasn't as widely received in 2.4 due to it
not being "officially sanctioned"...
BTW, it's not actually that much work.  Watching the list and getting feed
back on what works and what doesn't is all that it takes.  Naturally, there
will be a couple "frell, where was I when I did that" patches but that's
life in the semi-fast lane.
This will be a good thing.
Regards
James
