hi
found another smallish but annoying regression...description/patch below.
@intel: please add signed-off-by lines and forward to Linus before 2.6.18 if you argee.
@akpm: one round or so in -mm?
thanks, rgds

[PATCH] ACPI fix fan/thermal resume
the acpi driver suspend/resume patches that went in recently caused a regression
on my box (toshiba tecra 8000 laptop): after resume from swsusp the fan turns on
keeping blowing cold air out of my notebook. before the patches, the fan was off
and would only make noise when required. it's the same thing described in
bugzilla.kernel.org #5000. the acpi suspend/resume patches or at least parts of
them originate in this bug. now the last patch in the report (attach id 8438)
actually fixes the problem - for me and the reporter. this is a trimmed down
version of that patch.
