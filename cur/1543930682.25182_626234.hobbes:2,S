That is quite correct, even without the redirect the code passed all our 
tests.  Remember, we were testing for deadlock, not every possible 
block IO configuration.

Yes we do.  You appear to have missed the plot entirely.  I suppose I 
should remind you: this is about deadlock in _your_ subsystem that has 
been creating bug reports for years.  Block writeout deadlock.  Caused 
by a deficiency in _your_ subsystem.
Got a plan?  Or does endless, pointless flaming feel more like progress 
to you?
