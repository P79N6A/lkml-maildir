What I'd do is extend alloc_area_pmd, alloc_area_pte and so on to take an 
extra argument to be the page protection value.  The normal vmalloc can pass 
this in as just PAGE_KERNEL, and your new vmalloc_uncached can use some 
appropriate variant.

You *could* do it this way, but I don't think it's such a good idea.

No.  This is always the case with vmalloc.
