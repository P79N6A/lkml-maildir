This is because I nuked a few global variables. Video_font_height and 
video_scan_line where global variables. When you changed fonts it affected
every terminal. Now you might think this is correct behavior but what 
about systems with more than one graphics card. Say for example vgacon and 
fbcon. Now for vgacon you can't change the width of your fonts but for 
fbcon you can. So changing this global variable caused havoc for the VGA 
text mode display.

Hm. I can't seem to reproduce this problem.

I see. Only moving the cursor to the left cause this problem. Moving right 
is okay. Also hitting enter shows this problem. This is strange. It 
appears the flashing is the issue. I will see if a hardware cursor also has
this same issue. Thanks for pointing it out. Softcursor has another 
problem I also discover also so I can include it in my next set of fixes.
P.S
    KDGKBDTYPE.   (Wow, I can't believe we still have this. It should die)
