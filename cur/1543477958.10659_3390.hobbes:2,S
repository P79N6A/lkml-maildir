I've seen some nasty oopses too :(
They show up with some programs and not with others,
typical 'sufferers' are make, sh, su and ksymoops.
Other programs such as pine, ls, ldd, free and df have
no problems at all...
I got about 2 screenfulls of these while trying to run
ksymoops in order to trace the errors :((

I guess the *pde might contain a clue, but for the rest
it looks pretty useless. I only got an actual Oops once,
but that one immediately killed the interrupt handler :((
Nothing in the logs and I have to catch the next bus so
I haven't copied it by hand...
cheers,
