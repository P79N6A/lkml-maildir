Yep, this seems to fix it (usually one thread at least have already hung
at start for evo, now fine after a few mail fetches).
Is this a regression, or as in the other thread an issue with evolution
that should be fixed ?  (Note:  gnome-btdownload also seemed to hang
overnight with -mm[45], but I do not know if its related)
Thanks,
