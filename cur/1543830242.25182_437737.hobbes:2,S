Subject: [PATCH 006 of 12] md: Fix some small races in bitmap plugging in raid5.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/27/142

The comment gives more details, but I didn't quite have the
sequencing write, so there was room for races to leave bits
unset in the on-disk bitmap for short periods of time.

+/*
+ * BITMAP UNPLUGGING:
+ *
+ * The sequencing for updating the bitmap reliably is a little
+ * subtle (and I got it wrong the first time) so it deserves some
+ * explanation.
+ *
+ * We group bitmap updates into batches.  Each batch has a number.
+ * We may write out several batches at once, but that isn't very important.
+ * conf->bm_write is the number of the last batch successfully written.
+ * conf->bm_flush is the number of the last batch that was closed to
+ *    new additions.
+ * When we discover that we will need to write to any block in a stripe
+ * (in add_stripe_bio) we update the in-memory bitmap and record in sh->bm_seq
+ * the number of the batch it will be in. This is bm_flush+1.
+ * When we are ready to do a write, if that batch hasn't been written yet,
+ *   we plug the array and queue the stripe for later.
+ * When an unplug happens, we increment bm_flush, thus closing the current
+ *   batch.
+ * When we notice that bm_flush > bm_write, we write out all pending updates
+ * to the bitmap, and advance bm_write to where bm_flush was.
+ * This may occasionally write a bit out twice, but is sure never to
+ * miss any bits.
