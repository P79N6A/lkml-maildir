I believe that only 2GB or so of the 4GB RAM appears below the 4GB boundary.
The rest is accessed above 4GB, using Intel's 36-bit PAE functionality.
I think what you want to see is /proc/mtrr, annotated below by me:
reg00: base=0x080000000 (2048MB), size=2048MB: uncachable, count=1  I/O space
reg01: base=0x000000000 (   0MB), size=4096MB: write-back, count=1  first 2GB of RAM + I/O space
reg02: base=0x100000000 (4096MB), size=1024MB: write-back, count=1  third GB of RAM
reg03: base=0x140000000 (5120MB), size= 512MB: write-back, count=1  portion of 4th GB of RAM
reg04: base=0x160000000 (5632MB), size= 256MB: write-back, count=1  portion of 4th GB of RAM
reg05: base=0x170000000 (5888MB), size= 128MB: write-back, count=1  portion of 4th GB of RAM
reg06: base=0x178000000 (6016MB), size=  64MB: write-back, count=1  portion of 4th GB of RAM
reg07: base=0x0af800000 (2808MB), size=   8MB: uncachable, count=1  (?) dunno
From that, the visible RAM should be 2048 + 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 = 3968MB.
In /proc/meminfo, it reports MemTotal of 4067260kB, which divided by 1024 gives 3971MB.
The BIOS reports 4024MB.
But the MTRR values above do make it rather clear that nearly half the RAM
requires 33-bit physical addressing for access.
