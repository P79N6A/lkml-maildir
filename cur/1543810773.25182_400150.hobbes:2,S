No, certainly not.
Rafael said something like "being limited is bad, because it makes it
hard to change in-kernel snapshoting code". My reply was something
like "I hope people will stop changing in-kernel swsusp code, and hack
userland instead".
Atomic copy code has to stay with kernel: it needs disabled
interrupts, access to all the RAM, etc. It screams "kernel code".
