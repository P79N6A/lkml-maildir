Wrong place. Really. (And I do not think /sys is a better one either. 
But let others speak up.)

/proc/config,gz?

Reasonable. However, I would prefer that PATCH_COMMENT() evaluates to a 
string that is included in the module only (think MODULE_DESCRIPTION) 
and is not loaded during modprobe. Instead, modinfo your 
/lib/modules/`uname -r` tree and grep for your PATCH_COMMENT lines. Hey, 
that's even in userspace - no memory wasted.

Can you define patch? IMO, if you run a normal, mm, or git kernel, you 
usually find -mm or -git in the `uname -r` output. Of course there is 
also some development going on between -gitA and -gitB, but most people 
seem to keep together what they have patched.
>Seems very easy and has high ROI if you need to track patched kernels locally.
Patched by whom? (Tier-1 kernel developers (mainline, mm and those who 
run a tree on git.kernel.org), or Tier-2+ (Distro vendors))
