hi
can someone point me to the current maintainer of mdacon.c (Hercules console drv)?
i was unable to find it in MAINTAINERS and the header of the driver is not clear about this..
i would like to make some modifications to the code..small updates etc.
if there is no maintainer, is it ok to post the patch(es) to the lkml ? (when i finish them and testing : )
thanks
