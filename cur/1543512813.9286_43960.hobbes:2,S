    It's at least two interfaces. There's the "Something went wrong" keys,
    which covers most of them, and there's the Secure Attention Key.
No, SAK has nothing to do with SysRq. I mean: without SysRq you also have SAK.
    SAK (or an equivalent mechanism) is important for guaranteeing that
    you have a genuine login prompt - it shouldn't be on such an obscure
    key combination; it has a completely different purpose from the other
    SysRq keys.
But you can change the key combination for SAK using loadkeys.
Andries
# loadkeys
shift keycode 2 = SAK
^D
will make ! the SAK key.
