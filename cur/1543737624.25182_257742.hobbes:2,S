Your ata subsytem does not seem happy.
Can you provide:
- a short description of the system;
- the revision of your compiler;
- lspci -vx output;
- /sbin/lsmod output;
- complete dmesg after boot;
- vmstat 1 for a few seconds during network load;
- the content of /proc/interrupts adter a few seconds of network load.
