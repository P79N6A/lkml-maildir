thanks. tried to contact redflag, but they don`t answer. maybe support is 
being on holiday.... !?
linux kernel hackers - there is really no standard way to watch i/o metrics 
(bytes read/written) at process level?
it`s extremly hard for the admin to track down, what process is hogging the 
disk - especially if there is more than one task consuming cpu.
meanwhile i found blktrace and read into the documenation. looks really cool 
and seems to be very powerful tool - but it it`s seems a little bit 
"oversized" and not the right tool for this. seems to be for 
tracing/debugging/analysis
what about 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/12/89
  "with following patch, 
userspace processes/utilities will be able to access per process I/O 
statistics. for example, top like utilites can use this information" which 
has been posted to lkml one year ago ? any update on this ?
