Yeah, this was very consciously done as a "just make it work for now"
naming system.  If we want to stick with this naming, then I suppose we
could do a global bitmap.
But imo this naming is not very convenient - it would be nicer if we
	a) allowed users to specify a name (not sure how that would work
		logistically)
	b) made the namecnt variable for automatically named containers
		be per-directory.  I'd much rather see
		/containers/node1/node1
		/containers/node2
	than
		/containers/node1/node3
		/containers/node2
	(assuming /node2 was created between /node1 and /node1/node1 or
	/node1/node3)
