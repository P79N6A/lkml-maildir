The server will run with an fsuid equal to the user that authenticated,
you're correct.  So if you require krb5 access on an export, then nfs
access to a file on the export should be permitted only on rpc's that
are authenticated using credentials of a user with permission to access
the file.
Trond's pointing out that when you give the client your krb5 credentials
you're trusting it to do only what you tell it to with them.  You have
to trust the client's kernel at the very least, and also root on that
client, for the forseeable future.
