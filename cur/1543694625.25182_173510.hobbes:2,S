Ah, OK, this is interesting, so basically it's not realistic to
produce 'data recovery PCBs' for $5000 each, which allow direct
head-seeks, and raw data extraction etc.  Fair enough.  I'm not really
interested in data recovery at this level, to be honest, something is
very wrong if backups haven't been made, and dieing drives been
detected long before then.

I totally agree - the world outside the drive doesn't even need to
know this, and the drive should be trusted to make the right decision,
and be critical about it, (I.E. use an area previously thought to be
bad, but only if it tests _really_ good now, not marginal requiring
multiple reads and every last bit of error correction possible to get
the data back).
I am not saying that it's a great thing to risk re-using an area that
was previously bad, far from it, but the place to make the decision as
to whether the area is indeed bad or not is inside the drive, based on
all the data it has available, not from the host, based on the
limited, interpreted data available from the drive.

But it is very important, (in my opinion), that it _does_ remap in
that case.  Specifically, I don't think that an unrecoverable read
error should prevent any future writes to that LBA address from
succeeding, unless the drive is out of spare blocks.
Reporting a write failure to the user should never happen on a drive
capable of defect management.

Which attribute is that?  I can't see anything like that in the SMART
output from a Maxtor disk, but it sounds like a useful measurement :-/.
