But what about:
CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV
  This option will be removed soon. Any programs that want to use
  character special nodes like /dev/tap0 or /dev/route (all with major
  number 36) need this option, and need to be rewritten soon to use
  the real netlink socket.
  This is a backward compatibility option, choose Y for now.
IIRC it says "will be removed soon" and "This is a backward
compatibility option" for a long time now (since 2.3?, didn' check). It
is not strange for people not to enable it imho.
