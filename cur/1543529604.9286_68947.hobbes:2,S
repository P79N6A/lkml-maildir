Hi there.

There's one obvious problem with the ver_linux script, which can
be found by doing the following under bash or the equivalent
under csh or the like:
	alias ls='ls -F'
	. ver_linux
Watch the said script give completely crazy results!!! I've had
that alias in my ~/.bashrc for several years now.
Here's the patch that I first submitted for when kernel 2.0.36
was current, which deals with this once and for all without
destroying the user's environment. This patch is against 2.3.51
for reference.

ALAN: Any chance this will get included this time?
