Sorry dave, as I just learned, it isn't.   As reported by Jiri Slaby
<xslaby@fi.muni.cz>, Linus' tree now breaks on i386 :(
Interestingly, on i386:
__alignof__(struct _xt_align)	4
__alignof__(u_int64_t)		8
__alignof__(void *)		4
whereas on ppc:
__alignof__(struct _xt_align)	8
__alignof__(u_int64_t)		8
__alignof__(void *)		4
So your assumption that __alignof__(u_int64_t) == __alignof__(struct xt_align)
doesn't hold true for all archs.
I would therefore recommend applying my unmodified patch, and hope that
it then works on all archs simultaneously.

Our main problem is that we have to stay compatible with old userspace
programs that had a different definition for what has now become
XT_ALIGN().  So independent what might be the best solution from an
alignment point of view, we must match what old userspace thinks.
Yes, this all sucks.  And yes, we will see a new interface this year.
Promised.
Cheers,
	Harald.
