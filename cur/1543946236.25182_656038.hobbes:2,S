AIL = Active Item List
It is a sorted list all the logged metadata objects that have not
yet been written back to disk.  The xfsaild is responsible for tail
pushing the log.  i.e.  writing back objects in the AIL in the most
efficient manner possible.
Why a thread? Because allowing parallelism in tail pushing is a
scalability problem and moving this to it's own thread completely
isolates it from parallelism. Tail pushing only requires a small
amount of CPU time, but it requires a global scope spinlock.
Isolating the pushing to a single CPU means the spinlock is not
contended across every CPU in the machine.
How much did it improve scalability? on a 2048p machine with an
MPI job that did a synchronised close of 12,000 files (6 per CPU),
the close time went from ~5400s without the thread to 9s with the
xfsaild. That's only about 600x faster. ;)

Why not? Got to make use of all those cores machines have these
days. ;)
Fundamentally, threads are cheap and simple. We'll keep adding
threads where it makes sense as long as it improves performance and
scalability.

'git log' is your friend. The commits that introduce the new threads
explain why they are necessary. ;)
Cheers,
Dave.
