Subject: [patch 0/4] ide: Break ide_lock to per-hwgroup lock
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The following patchset breaks down the global ide_lock to per-hwgroup lock.
We have taken the following approach.
1. Move the hwif tuning code from probe_hwif to ideprobe_init, after
hwif_init so that hwgroups are present for all the hwifs when the tune
routines for the hwifs are invoked (patch 1)
2. Change the core ide code to use hwgroup->lock instead of ide_lock.
Deprecate ide_lock (patch 2)
3. Change the host controllers to use hwgroup->lock (patch 3)
4. Change host controller drivers to use per driver lock instead of ide_lock
where needed or hwgroup->lock on case by case basis. This can be done 
incrementally for various controllers and we will have working code between 
patches -- this is done now for piix controller only.  Eventually, 
we can change all controllers to remove ide_lock
Thanks to Bartlomiej for comments and suggestions.
Patchset follows.  Patchset tested on a smp box with a piix controller.
Thanks,
Kiran
