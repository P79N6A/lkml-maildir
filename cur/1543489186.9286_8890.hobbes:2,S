    If you want to be clever, you can do what I did when I did the
    WebShield project for McAfee Associates;  if you have a trusted
    host inside the firewall, you can have the firewall bring up
    one interface at a time and ping for that machine.  The interface
    that gets a reply is the inside interface, and you can go on from
    there.
    I didn't use eth0 or eth1 for either interface.  I defined, in a
    configuration file somewhere, INTERNAL_IF and EXTERNAL_IF, which
    were set by the initialization script that did the pinging (also
    useful if either of the interfaces is going to be a token-ring
    or arcnet interface...)

                   \/                   some of the vagaries of the kernel.
