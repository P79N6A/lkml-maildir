Hi all,
Support for NUMA has been there in Linux Kernel from years. Here comes 
the initial set (long delayed) of NUMA Test-cases from LTP and written 
by sivakumar.c@in.ibm.com. You can download a copy of LTP Suite 
containing NUMA-testcases from:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ltp/ltp-nightly-snapshot_numa.tgz?download
We request you to comment on the effectiveness/coverage of these 
testcases and help us contribute to the same.
Your suggestions/corrections are extremely valuable and immensely welcome.
Regards & Thanks--
Subrata Modak
