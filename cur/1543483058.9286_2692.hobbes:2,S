I have a patch
    
http://www.rano.demon.co.uk/kernel_patch/003
which extends Unicode support to include mouse selection and keyboard
mapping, so I'm inviting anyone who is interested in consolemap.c,
selection.c or keyboard.c in drivers/char to take a look please and
send comments.
There are some explanations at the top of the file.
