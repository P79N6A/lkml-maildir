| This has needed doing for a while.  Reviews welcome.

| As an attachment because it's about 64k "raw".
Some could be fuser errors (with docbook stylesheets etc.)...
a.  uses "gloss-timer" and "gloss-timers": choose one
b.  docbook complained about many unclosed or unmatched instances
    of </sect1>, </chapter>, </listitem>, etc.
c.  docbook complains about some 'C' syntactic items that are
inside <LiteralLayout> or <programlisting>.  E.g.:
- 'cache' in
	list_for_each_entry(i, &cache, list)
- 'obj-' in
	list_del(&obj->list);
- 'cache_lock' in
	down(&cache_lock);
(see the pattern: '&' shouldn't be special inside these blocks,
or at least that's how I think about it, but the software disagrees)
- docbook (at least my version) dislikes these #includes:
 #include <linux/list.h>
 #include <linux/slab.h>
 #include <linux/string.h>
+#include <linux/rcupdate.h>
 #include <asm/semaphore.h>
 #include <asm/errno.h>
I'd read it for content soonish.
Thanks for the update.
