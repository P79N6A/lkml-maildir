It wouldn't work anyway.  There has to be _one_ interrupt stack per
CPU.  When an interrupt happens (or a certain bit is set in an 
exception vector), the CPU saves SP in the USP or KSP register
(user or kernel SP) and loads SP from the ISP register.  USP and 
KSP are considered part of process context and are saved and restored
across context switches.  ISP is not.  
Thinks out loud...
Or maybe we could play tricks with ISP during the context switch...
It would certainly be made simpler by Linux's all-or-nothing approach
to enabling/disabling interrupts.  (In contrast to VMS which makes
extensive use of the VAX's 31 interrupt priority levels.  Process
re-scheduling happens at priority 3, devices interrupt at priority 16-23,
power failure interrupts at 30, for example.)
Or maybe not...  What if a device interrupted at IPL 20.  Another
device could interrupt at IPL 21 in the window before we block 
all interrupts in the first interrupt handler.  Then this second
handler triggers a resched.  If we switch to a different interrupt
stack then we'll destroy the stack context of the first handler.
Unless we either copy around the stack context (ugh) or map the
same physical stack into each task_struct.  Seems a bit wasteful.
I think I'll go for the 'current is in a well-known register'
approach and see how this goes...
Later,
Kenn
