As said above, I'd like to see the messages from modpost deferred or
re-issued at the end of the module building process (i.e. after the
perhaps hundreds of *.mod.c files got compiled and the same number of
*.ko got linked, which on a typical distribution will easily scroll off
the original warnings even with a 1000 line history, as seems to be the
default in many cases).
