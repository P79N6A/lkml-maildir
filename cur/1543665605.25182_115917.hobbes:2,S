No, I already wrote "CIDR" for character devices.
(Will submit it when 2.5.65 appears.)
There is no use for i_cdev or struct char_device today,
and I will not use it for character device registration.
So unless you or someone else decides to start using it,
it can just be thrown out.

[I already submitted the patch throwing it out, but someone,
maybe it was Roman Zippel, complained that that was going
in the wrong direction. In the very long run that may be true
(or not), but for 2.6 I do not see the point of this dead code.]
