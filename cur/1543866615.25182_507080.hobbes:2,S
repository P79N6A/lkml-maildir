crappy name too ;)  At least two filesystems have defined their own
static-scope init_file() and so they'll explode if they somehow maange
to include file.h.
I guess we can cross that bridge when we fall off it, but sometime it might be
prudent to do s/init_file/configfs_init_file/ and ditto sysfs_init_file.
