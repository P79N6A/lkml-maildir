My guess is that kmix is the cuplrit.
kmix tends to turn on all mixer switches uncoditionally, and
saves/restores the mixer config by itself.
Look at /etc/asound.state whether it contains the value of "Headphone
Jack Sense" control true or false.
BTW, the default value of this control switch was fixed for ThinkPads
on ALSA tree since long time ago, but unfortunately the patch wasn't
accepted for 2.6.11...
