That's a little more than half the question.  The other 40% is can users
write good policies.
I think it will, and already has, become easier for selinux.  But in
this case I wonder whether some sort of contest could be beneficial.  We
all know of Russel Coker's open root selinux play machines.  That's a
powerful statement.  Things I'd like to see in addition are
	a. a similar setup with apparmour
	b. a similar setup where "mere mortals" set up the selinux policy
For the first few rounds, rather than judge one way or the other, we
could hopefully publish the results in a way to encourage a flurry of
selinux policy tools - one of which may actually be useful.
Given that AA is a 'targeted' type of setup, I guess it would need to
have a strict sshd policy, and the game would be whether the policy can
keep anyone with the root password from escaping the policy.
