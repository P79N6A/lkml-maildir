Huh? What do you mean? oldconfig still works as before, above only happens 
if you touch .config or a Kconfig file, kconfig tries to automatically 
update .config and will fail if stdio is redirected, but needs user input.
The problem is not a missing fflush, the question is why kconfig couldn't 
detect the pipe.
bye, Roman
