And in the worst style of following up on oneself ..
from my ifconfig eth0
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:A0:24:B5:E3:AB  
          inet addr:136.201.105.3  Bcast:136.201.255.255  Mask:255.255.0.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:17720994 errors:2925 dropped:2925 overruns:3080

          TX packets:8406389 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:6 carrier:6
          collisions:22574 txqueuelen:100 
          Interrupt:10 Base address:0x6100 
Could those errors on RX packets have anything to do with it?
