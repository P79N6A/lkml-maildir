It would still make sense but only if you can write to a pipe on a 
read-only partition which I have always assumed is not possible.
However, now that you queried this, I went and tried it and yes, you can 
write to a named pipe after remounting read-only, so you are right, the 
check does make sense in this case.  One learns something new every day.

Andrew, please do not apply my patch...
