This is going to make the structure huge - not only you have the 32-bit 
variables for every CPU, but you have one global set of 64-bit variables 
(possibly you will need a lock for the 64-bit vars.)
Also another thing to consider is portability across architectures - we don't 
need all this code on 64-bit arches.
On the other hand, per-cpu stats may possibly make up for the extra code - no 
cache bouncing, etc.

Hehe, the thing is, that when 64bits beecome more common you will have this 
huge number of unused x86 computers that people will:
- - throw out
- - donate
- - convert to all sorts of "embedded" systems which need stable OS (read: 
Linux) (these include routers)
So, x86 is here to stay for some time.
Jeff.
