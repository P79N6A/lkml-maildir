As a simple user without much knowledge of kernel internals, much less
so filesystems, couldn't something based on the same principle of
lsof+fam be used to handle these situations? lsof, if I'm not
mistaken, can tell a user if someone (and who) has fd opened on a file
system; and fam can notify other processes that a particular file has
been modified. Unionfs could use something like lsof (or som similar
ad hoc solution) to see if something has anything opened on a
filesystem, and it could use something like fam to detect changes in
the underlying filesystem and flush caches as appropriate.
Of course, this wouldn't solve "concurrent changes" problems, but this
could be made possible by having a system to synchronize locks across
filesystems.
