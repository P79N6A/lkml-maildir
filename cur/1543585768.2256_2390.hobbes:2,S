Hi
would somebody be able to explain to me
when you try to open /dev/tap0 which is a
character device file which has the permissions
File: "tap0"
Size: 0            Filetype: Character Device
Mode: (0666/crw-rw-rw-)
when tried to open
[mistral@linux /dev]$ cat tap0
cat: tap0: Operation not permitted
and strace shows that it gets a permission error
open("tap0", O_RDONLY|0x8000)           = -1 EPERM
is it just me or is this either
a) a bug
b) very misleading
thanks
	James
