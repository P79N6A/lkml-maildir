I really didn't mean to 'force' anyone to use a specific tools or even type of
tool such as an 'SCM' generally. I didn't even suggest it. I just wish to have one
as I'm used to it and IMHO it makes thing easier. Applying is easier (where
'patch -p1 < ../file.patch is not really difficult either), getting back to a
specific date is easier, commenting is easier (check-in descriptions).
Moreover, just _one_ more thing which is most important at least to me:
If one can do a checkout on a daily basis with let's say 3 new patches checked
in, one can test these. The other day there are maybe another 2 new patches
applied which are to be tested. This would just speed up the testing cycle
whereas a 3 MB patch with tons of fixes and testing is just like a kick-down
with the hand-brake pulled. Sometimes I#M really overwhelmed by how many patches
came in with the recent -mm. ACPI, ALSA, VM, various FS stuff, ... It's quite
impossible to me to really test the patches in an effective manner due to having
my 2 eyes focussed on too many things at one. I do test ALSA with various types
of in/out operation while my reiserfs partition is on the way to hell. To me
that doesn't sound like effective testing.
This is just about testing and debugging time effectiveness and not about some
religious thing a la SCM vs. patches.
