   An example of hardware with fully separable user/kernel spaces
   are Motorola 68020-68060 series processors.
   They have those special instructions to choose (in kernel mode)
   what address spaces to use at which data access phase of the
   special moves.  There is some speed penalty, of course..

   That could be the one called "Linux", if a bunch of conditions
   are met -- beginning with suitable hardware.
