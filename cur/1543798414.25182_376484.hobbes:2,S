Why? it's an open source world, what you suggest is more something for a
"must hide behind interfaces" closed world ;)
if done right, the LLDD gets access to the transport class information,
including the array of stats, so the LLDD can update those just fine.
Just the API should be clear about who owns updating which field; a
comment will suffice for that ;)

way way too complex for no reason.
Remember the scsi layer is a layered concept, but also upside down: even
though the transport class layers on top of the LLDD, it's the LLDD that
drives that class, not the other way around. The same could be done with
selected statistics; have the transport layer do the exporting to sysfs
and all that stuff, but have the LLDD keep track of them. (of course
only for those that are relevant in this sense; if the transport class
is the natural place to update, then it should be done there)
