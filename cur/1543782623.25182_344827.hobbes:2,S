If you reduce "all" to whatever would have been done in fork
originially, then you've got a big win in some cases and a minimal
loss in others, and it's easy to argue you've got something better.
Now changng "all" to something even less might be an even bigger win,
but that requires a lot of benchmarking to justify.
