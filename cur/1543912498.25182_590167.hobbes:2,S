There are two disjoint directories. I am wondering why there would be cache
coherency issues in this case? Is this Linus nfs implementation specific or
all other Unix systems all have the same issue?

"working" as in "I can mount the directory and do my work". And there has
never been any problems as far as I know.

Fine. These are all very nice theories, but I just want to report this
regression and hope it won't cause any big problems for any users out there.
In the mean time, I am returning to 2.6.22.
