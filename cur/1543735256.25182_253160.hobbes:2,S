It didn't happen to me, but on 2.6.9-rc1-mm5 I had the problem that 
Ctrl+Alt+Del apparently did not work after "init 5" and Ctrl+Alt+F[1-9].  
Whatever I did, I couldn't reboot the machine this way from any console (of 
course 'reboot" worked as usual).
Now I'm running 2.6.9-rc2-mm1 and it works as expected (w.r.t. Ctrl+Alt+Del at 
least), so I'd suggest you to try this one.
Greets,
