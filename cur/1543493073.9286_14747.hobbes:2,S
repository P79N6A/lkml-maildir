He just said the kernel would be modified. NFS server support isn't
needed. Any support
would be in the client.

The NFS client can't control whether or not the sticky bit is set on the
server, but
it CAN control whether or not it honours the sticky bit from the server.
Honouring the
sticky bit will require CAP_SETFCAP, and a flag. You would only allow it
if you know
that the server is capability-sticky smart. In order to mount any
filesystem capability-aware would require CAP_SETFCAP.

How do you get the executable and it's sticky bit onto the
capability-aware Linux box?
It won't allow the sticky bit to be set when you write the file unless
your shell on
that box has CAP_SETFCAP. If this is the case, you are wasting your
time, you are
already root-equivalent.
