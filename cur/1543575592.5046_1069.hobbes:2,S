 contains patches for kdb
v1.7 against 2.4.0-test11 and 2.4.0-test12.
There is a large amount of internal reorganisation from kdb v1.6 to
v1.7 to make it easier to support multiple architectures.  Most of this
is feedback from the kdb for IA64 work in progress.
The patch against 2.4.0-test11 fixes the boot hang with NMI for UP.
kdb v1.7 contains a new "sections" command.  Primarily intended for
interfacing to external debuggers such as gdb, its output is not very
human readable.
