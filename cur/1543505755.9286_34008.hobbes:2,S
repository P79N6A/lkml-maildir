The select() functionality in the 2.2.9 kernel appears to be broken.  If
there is nothing readable or writable when select() is initially
called, it
will not return until it times out.  The man page says (and the way it
is
normally used) that it will return when something int readfds becomes
readable or something in writefds becomes writable, and that the
timeout is
only an upper boundary.  Our testing indicates that it will not return
until
the timeout expires.  Anyone know of a workaround?  Or has anyone else
noticed this problem yet?
