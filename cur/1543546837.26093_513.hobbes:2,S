The paper that best describes Pike's point of view on threads isn't on line,
but would be
Rob Pike and Dave Presotto and Sean Dorward and Bob Flandrena and Ken
Thompson and Howard Trickey and Phil Winterbottom, Plan 9 from Bell Labs,
Computing Systems, Vol. 8, 3, pp. 221--254, Summer 1995. 
IIRC.
There was a thread around that time in comp.arch or comp.os.research in
which Pike debated threads with others, if you can find an archive going
back that far, it might make his point of view clearer.
clone() is, of course, a subset of 'variable weight processes', an idea that
has been reinvented a half dozen times over the past 25 years.
For a 7 year old take on how to dissect the components of an OS into its
minimual possible set of features, you can read the Brevix design paper at
http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/John_Wilkes/papers/BrevixDesign.1.01.pdf
although I now consider Brevix to have been a waste of time. However, it is
clear in the distinction between persistent objects, name spaces, and
threads-of-control, as well as practically banishing the 'kernel/user'
boundary above the minimal virtual-machine implementation.

This is nothing but word games.
As clone() demonstrates, there are lots of things that you can share  
between tasks; when you actually differentiate between "processes" and  
"threads", the usual definition is that the former don't share VM, whereas  
the latter do.
Can you point me to the text that makes Pike's original point? Google  
certainly wasn't able to help me; I mainly found a recent article about OS  
research that, IMHO, made enough mistakes to be a bad introdouction to  
Pike. (Unless of course the original text is similar.)
