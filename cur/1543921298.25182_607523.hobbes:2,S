Did you try another cable?  DId you try using both the old IDE drivers
and the new PATA libata drivers?  What is the hdd=ide-cd supposed to
do?  Do you have a device present as hdc and if not, then why not?
(Hint: ATA spec requires a master before you can have a slave, even
though it frequently does work with just a slave.  Of course cable
select seems even nicer since then the device at the end of an 80 wire
cable is automatically master, and any additional device added to the
middle connector on the cable becomes slave, and you should not connect
a device to the middle connector without one on the end).
Also make sure the right end of the cable is connected to the mainboard,
just in case that matters.
