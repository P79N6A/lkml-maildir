Hello,
I'm having problems with 2.4.5 and my pppoe connection.
The kernel compiles fine, and works fine too, until I reboot, at which
time it decides it no longer wants to work, and any time I attempt to
call my start-pppoe script, i get:
May 28 15:54:28 rocket pppd[3091]: pppd 2.4.1 started by root, uid 0
May 28 15:54:28 rocket pppd[3091]: Using interface ppp0
May 28 15:54:28 rocket pppd[3091]: Connect: ppp0 <--> /dev/ttyp0
May 28 15:54:43 rocket pppd[3091]: Hangup (SIGHUP)
May 28 15:54:43 rocket pppd[3091]: Modem hangup
May 28 15:54:43 rocket pppd[3091]: Connection terminated.
May 28 15:54:44 rocket pppd[3091]: Exit.
I am assuming that this is because of my eth0, which shows in ifconfig:
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:00:00:00:00:00 (it's using
via-rhine chipset, compiled into kernel, not a module)
This _only_ occurs after I reboot (ie. i can start up the new 2.4.5
kernel and work it perfectly once, then reboot and it doesnt work)
Anybody have any ideas?
Thanks,
Daniel Rose
