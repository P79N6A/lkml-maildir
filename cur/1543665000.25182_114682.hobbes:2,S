Ahh.. Thanks.  I'm still using older versions myself.

Well, the problem is that the replacement function is only valid on
Linux, so I need to have the <OS> test in there anyways.  It may be
"bad style", but the test needs to exist _somewhere_.  Besides, I've
never been one to be convinced to do something purely based on
stylistic arguments.  Give me a real technical reason why it needs to
be different and I'll consider changing it.
