So I assume you were trying to saying that backing out the patches makes
the machine boot, and leaving them in kills it, right?  And does Andi's
"[PATCH] x86_64: Optimize nodemask operations slightly" fix your
problem?  I'm assuming that's what the reference to "Andi understanding
the issue" meant?  Or is there still a problem booting x86_64 with the
numnodes -> node_online_map patches?
