I'm glad to see this piece of crud disappear, but what will replace it?
The problem is that the new 3c59x.o supports both Cardbus and PCI/EISA
NICs.  It is possibly unique in this respect.
The PCMCIA package specifically looks in
/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/pcmcia and by default
it uses insmod, not modprobe.
So we have this single driver sitting in net/3c59x.o, and a package
which expects to find it in pcmcia/3c575_cb.o.
I believe one solution is to
1: make cardmgr use `modprobe 3c575_cb' and
   not `insmod /lib/modules/.../3c575_cb.o'.
   This is done by giving cardmgr the `-d' option.
2: Alias 3c575_cb onto 3c59x via modules.conf.
This is still pretty ugly and I'd be interested in
any suggestions for improvement.
