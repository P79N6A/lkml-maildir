Yes, it has been speculated that some "time warps" were
caused by "someone" reading only one of the two bytes from
the PIT.  It puts the following reads out of sync.  If this
was caused by an interrupt (which, of course, is where the
PIT is read by the kernel) between two reads, it could well
cause the "time warps" that have been observed.
