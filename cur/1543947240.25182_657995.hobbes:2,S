I know you don't like the patch from Jon Smirl and you also explained your reasons.
Fortunately, I2c no longer uses numeric device IDs but names. So what are the alternatives?
1. modify the I2c subsystem to accept OF names additionally to I2c names (proposed by Jon smirl).
2. record the I2c name in the dts tree, either as seperate tag (like linux,i2c-name="<i2c-name>")
   or as additional compatible entry (like compatible="...", "linux,<i2c-name>").
3. use a glue layer with a translation map.
What is the preferred way to do this?
Thanks,
Jochen
