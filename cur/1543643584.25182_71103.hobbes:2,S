Talking about dumping oopsen, would there be any usefulness in outputting crash data to the PC speaker, using a slow, (~300 bps) modulation that would survive being captured on a cassette using a walkman with a microphone, then decoded using a userspace program from a sampled .au file?
Just thought it might be easily implementable, as it doesn't have any pre-requisits, (other than having a PC speaker, which *almost* everybody has).
