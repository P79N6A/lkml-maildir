The advantage of 64 bits is that you can have relatively sparser device
numbers.  [SCSI bus addressing comes to mind as an example where this
would be good.]
I wonder if it might be possible to do something special for NFS, like
maybe make for NFS consumption a special file system where specific 64
bit device numbers are mapped into a 32 bit range...  [And didn't I
already see some posts about device number aliasing?]
It might be good, from a security standpoint, to arrange things so no
devices can be exported over NFS without proper aliases.
