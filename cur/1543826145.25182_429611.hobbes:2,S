Now your arithmetic is failing you.  According to my formula:
1. With one task in group A you give it 10% which is what you get when 
you divide 10% by one.
2. With two tasks in group A you give them each somewhere between 5% 
(which is 10% divided by 2) and 10%.  If they are equally busy you give 
them each 5% and if they are not equally busy you give them you give 
them larger caps.
Another, probably a better but more expensive, formula is to divide the 
10% between them in proportion to their demand.  Being careful not to 
give any of them a zero cap, of course.  I.e. in the two task 10% case 
they each get 5% if they are equally busy but if one is twice as busy as 
the other it gets a 6.6% cap and the other gets 3.3% (approximately).
