i_sem nests outside lock_page, normally.  I guess that can be avoided though.

I did a patch which switched loop to use the file_operations.read/write
about a year ago.  Forget what happened to it.  It always seemed the right

yup, we'd need to create a new handler for writes, or pass `write_access'
into ->nopage.  I think others (dwdm2?) have seen a need for that.

Unpleasant, isn't it.
I guess the path of least resistance is to do it within ntfs for now.
