Side note: it's still usually fairly easy. Especially if you have a known 
fix for the other bug, you can usually just do the equivalent of
	git cherry-pick <fixcommit>
at each point during this bisect (or just have a known patch that you keep 
applying and un-applying), and you're largely done.
Of course, if the area with the fix keeps changing, or if the fix is 
really intrusive and nasty, this gets hairy, but at least in this case the 
patch is fairly trivial and it shouldn't cause any trouble at all to do 
this.
The only real down-side is just the mindless extra work, and the possible 
added confusion you get from modifying the history at the points you're 
testing. "git bisect" is not necessarily happy about auto-picking a new 
bisection point with a dirty tree, for example, so before you mark 
something "good" or "bad", you should generally try to do so with a clean 
git tree (ie if you apply a patch at each stage, do "git reset --hard" to 
remove the patch before you do the "git bisect bad/good" stage).
Similarly, especially at the end of the bisection run, if you actually use 
"git cherry-pick" to *add* a commit, the bisection will now take that 
added commit into account when trying to pick the next commit to check, 
which is not what you really want. It probably doesn't matter that much 
during the early stages (when bisection is really jumping around wildly 
anyway, and one commit more or less doesn't really matter), but again, it 
might be a good idea to make a habit of undoing the cherry-pick, the same 
way you'd undo a patch (eg "git reset --hard HEAD^" would do it, if you 
have exactly one cherry-pick that you tested).
