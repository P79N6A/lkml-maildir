Hi Michael and Martin,
thanks a lot for the testing!
I rechecked the changes and really don't see any reason for a
slowdown. Michael's measurements seem to confirm that this is just a
statistical effect. I suggest: when in doubt, do 10 kernel compiles
instead of 5. A simple statistical error estimation as I did for
schedbench might help, too. Guess I've sent you the script a while
ago.
I understand from your emails that the 2.5.53 patches apply and work
for 2.5.54, therefore I'll wait for 2.5.55 with a rediff.
Regards,
Erich
