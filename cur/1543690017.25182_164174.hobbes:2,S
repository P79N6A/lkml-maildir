On the other hand, the ISO C99 definition is probably something like:
an integral type capable of storing the values 0 through 255
inclusive.  (ok, I don't have a copy of the new standard but I have
seriously examined the old one.)  I would not count on uint8_t
necessarily being unsigned on unusual hardware.  Linux on the other
hand probably means __u8 as an exactly eight bit unsigned integer
value.  While these may LOOK like identical statements, Linux is
[probably] making a significantly stronger statement.
I would say - keep the Linux types, and then document exactly what
Linux means by them somewhere.  In particular, if Linux were ported to
a 9/18/36 bit platform, what would the semantics of __u8 be?  (Ok,
maybe the documentation should say such a port is not considered to be
viable at this time.)
