ok, i fixed that in the patch and reordered the PAGE_KERNEL_NOCACHE_EXEC 
patch to come before yours.

you are right in that there is no immediate correctness reason for it. 
The reason is to eventually get away from any MTRR dependencies. If some 
other OS uses PATs and the BIOS sets up the wrong MTRR, then the other 
OS might still having a working EFI, while Linux might crash and burn. 
So we try to get both the MTRRs and the pagetable attributes match the 
purpose of the area in question. If _both_ levels of attributes agree it 
cannot hurt, but if one of them is wrong, the other one still saves the 
day.
that's why we changed all ioremaps to default to cache-disabled (PCD) in 
latest x86.git as well. For years the x86 architecture set the ioremap 
pagetable entries to cacheable by default and only the MTRRs (and the 
BIOS writers) saved us from trouble. Now we try to be a bit more 
defensive and avoid "BIOS bug causes only Linux to crash and burn while 
other OSs work fine" type of scenarios.
