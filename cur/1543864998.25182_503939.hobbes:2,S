Or perhaps not read at all, which would explain the problem.
cpio represents a hard link as who headers with the same type and the 
same file (inode) number and a link count that is > 1.  Only the first 
one contains data; the subsequent ones have length 0.  It's fairly easy 
for a bug in the decoder to truncate the file upon encountering the 
second header, since this is somewhat of a special case (it would have 
been better if the cpio format distinguished "hard link" explicitly, as 
tar does.)
I will look into this as soon as I can, but as I'm currently in the 
middle of job hunting it might take until the weekend.
