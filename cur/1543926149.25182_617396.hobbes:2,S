this is bp->b_sema which lookup wants.

and this is the nasty nfsd case where a filldir callback calls back
into lookup.  I suspect we're somehow holding b_sema already.  Previously
this was okay because we weren't inside the actualy readdir code when
calling filldir but operate on a copy of the data.
This gem has bitten other filesystem before, I'll see if I can find a
way around it.
