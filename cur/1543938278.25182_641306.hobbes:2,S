Actually, I think it depends on the specific MSR - some use the halves 
for different data, whereas others treat it as a large 64-bit object.
Ironically enough, the way the MSR interfaces were carried into the 
64-bit world makes the situation worse on 64 bits; edx:eax is the common 
way to represent a 64-bit value on 32 bits.
