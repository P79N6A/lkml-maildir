First, I think there is practical value in providing confidentiality
control on the overt channels, even if covert channels remain.  We have
to start somewhere.
Second, information flow is not just a confidentiality issue - see my
other email.  It is quite important as well for integrity, and integrity
corruption in order to assume control over a privileged subject or trick
it into abusing its power can be done solely via a data channel - it
doesn't require explicit flow of authority.
Lastly, if you want to judge AA as a jail mechanism, I think you'll find
it fails there too.  So where does that leave it?  An easy-to-use yet
inadequate solution for MAC or jail.
