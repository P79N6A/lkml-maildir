Subject: 2.5.44-ac2 8139too WOL: can't power down onboard device

Hello,
I'm using 2.5.44-ac2 with the 8139too driver on an ECS K7VT3A motherboard
with onboard Ethernet:
00:0e.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8139/8139C/8139C+ (rev 10).  
I find that whenever I power down this machine, the Ethernet controller
stays powered on according to my hub.  This is even though ethtool says
that WOL is disabled, as below.  Is there any way to power down the
Ethernet controller on this board?  Any suggestions would be appreciated.
Cheers,
Wayne
