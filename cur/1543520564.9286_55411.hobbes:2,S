Stack smashing requires usually exactly the same "detailed knowledge of
the data
segment layout" alredy now too. Have a look at the prominent mountd
or the wuftp exploints for example. This is due to the fact that
those attacs are targeting globals, which will get very different
addresses due to general data aligment particular to the special
compiler version used.
