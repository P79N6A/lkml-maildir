All Linux kernels prior to 2.6.0-test2-mm3-1 would silently fail to
complete fsync() and msync() operations if they encountered an I/O
error, resulting in corruption. If a particular disk subsystem was
producing these errors, the symptoms would likely be:
- no error reported
- no messages in logs
- independent of kernel version, etc.
- suddenly appear at some point in drive life
- works flawlessly on other machines 
If you can reproduce this corruption, please try running against mm3-1
and seeing if it reports problems (both to fsync and in logs).
