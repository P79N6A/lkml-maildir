Subject: bug reading /proc/sys/kernel/*: only first byte read.

I were debugging a weird problem with busybox, and come across
this chunk of strace output:
open("/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease", O_RDONLY) = 3
read(3, "2", 1)                         = 1
read(3, "", 1)                          = 0
close(3)                                = 0
As you can see, after reading one byte from /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease,
next read() returns 0, which is treated as end-of-file by an application.
Why busybox does this single-byte reads is another question (many
shells does that, in order to be able to stop reading at newline).
But this is definitely a bug in kernel, and should be fixed....
It exists in 2.6.17 and 2.6.18
Thanks.
