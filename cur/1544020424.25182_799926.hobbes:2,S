Yes, I saw the report in Bugzilla.

I'd prefer to create a new hook, althouth there may be a problem with ACPI
vs interrupts off.  In the meantime, I'd like to test some recent fixes on top
of this patch and try a couple of debug patches to see what's up (in the
Bugzilla if that's not a problem).

Yeah.
Well, the approach is a bit x86-ish ...
