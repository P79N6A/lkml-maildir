It is absolutely possible, especially over loopback.
It can happen on the send side for any device which indicates
the NETIF_F_HIGHDMA capability, and because loopback indicates
this feature this means we'll see such highmem pages in packets
on receive too.
There is thus also nothing preventing a real hardware device
from feeding highmem packets into the networking stack.
