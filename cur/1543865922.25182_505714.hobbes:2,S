Hello!
I'm having problems with s2ram being unable to restore my Intel 945GM (a 
Dell D420 laptop) when resuming. I think everything else is restored 
properly (I have input so I can reboot or suspend again). Full 
hibernation is working flawless on this machine including restoring 
framebuffer and X (kudos to the suspend team :).
I've tried both with and without framebuffer on 2.6.20.
Using the vbetool-trick brings the backlight on (it's otherwise off 
after resume).
.config, lspci and dmesg (prior to suspend) is attached.
Is there any other info I can provide to assist futher debugging just 
shout and I will do anything to assist - I would be really happy to get 
s2ram working :)
