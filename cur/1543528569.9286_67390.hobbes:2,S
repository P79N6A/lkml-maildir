Yeah, I keep my source in CVS, but I'm in no position to force every
secretary around here to stuff her Word Documents into CVS (and, frankly,
I'm not sure it'd be wise either.) Actually, we've managed to showel most
of our "production code" into CVS, but there's no point in trying to get
the five or ten year old stuff (that somebody "might" need) into CVS.
Besides, I have temporary source trees that are never ment to be properly
version controlled -- just hacked around and thrown away.

Surely there's overhead. But I never said it should be enabled for
everybody.

That's the whole point of a cow link as far as I can see. I'm not sure if
"verifying if it is a cow link" could really induce massive overhead (one
if() ). And the moving part only happens _if_ it is a cow link -- what you
don't use, you don't pay for. Of course, the cow link would take altering
the fs format; a new field to dir_entry or something.
