No, the receive errors are independent from the status interrupt.
I have now got confirmation by another user that they also
happen on a different thinkpad when not using a USB hub, but
with a hub everything seems fine.

Ok, I can resend.

hmm, I wasn't aware that ethtool does this. I did check that mii-tool
works though.
Going through the ethtool operations, I think that it should be
possible to implement a few of them, including ETHTOOL_GREGS,
ETHTOOL_GEEPROM, ETHTOOL_SEEPROM, ETHTOOL_NWAY_RST and ETHTOOL_GPERMADDR.
Do you think these should be done?
