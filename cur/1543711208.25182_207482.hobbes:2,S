Cool.  I'm glad we've figured out how to fix all the problems
with object based rmap.  I'd be happy to get rid of the pte
based reverse mapping stuff...

Yeah, we'll definately need the prio_tree stuff before the
object based rmap can go into the mainline kernel...
As for nonlinear mappings, if the VMA is locked, no need to
check anything ... the swappable VMAs could be a bit of a
problem though, though I guess we could just unmap a large
number of ptes ;)

Take a look at User Mode Linux ...
I don't think wants to use mlock, and I suspect it doesn't
use remap_file_pages (yet?).  Once it does use remap_file_pages,
we'll still need to find a more or less efficient way to swap
out those pages ...

They both have their advantages and disadvantages.  We'll
have to find out in practice which one works better...
I hope to get some time soon to implement the mm-based
reverse mapping, so we can test both alternatives.
At that point we'll want to split the file-backed stuff off
into a separate patch, on which we could layer either your
vma-based or Linus's mm-based reverse mapping scheme.
I'm kind of curious which one will end up better under
which workloads ;)
