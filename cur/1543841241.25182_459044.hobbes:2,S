The history we have on our development tree goes only until Feb, 2004.
This line were added before it.
I've looked briefly the driver. The same allow_signal is also present on
tvaudio (part of bttv driver). BTTV were written to kernel 2.1, so, this
piece seems to be an inheritance from 2.1 time.
No other V4L drivers have this one, although cx88-tvaudio (written on
2.6 series) have a similar kthread to check if audio status changed. 
On cx88-tvaudio, it does:
                if (kthread_should_stop())
                        break;
instead of:
                if (dev->thread.shutdown || signal_pending(current))
                        goto done;
It is likely to work if we remove allow_signal and replacing the
signal_pending() by kthread_should_stop() as above.
The better is to check the real patch on a saa7134 hardware before
submiting to mainstream. You may submit the final patch for us to test
at the proper hardware.
Cheers, 
Mauro.
