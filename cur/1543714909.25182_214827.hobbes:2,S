Hi,
I have in my laptop this irda port:
IrCOMM protocol (Dag Brattli)
nsc-ircc, Found chip at base=0x02e
nsc-ircc, driver loaded (Dag Brattli)
IrDA: Registered device irda0
modules.conf:
alias irda0 nsc-ircc
options nsc-ircc dongle_id=0x08
When I try connect with 2.4.26 kernel to T68i
I getts this message and then port freezes - no devices discovered and no 
communication, sometimes freezes whole laptop:
irlap_adjust_qos_settings(), Detected buggy peer, adjust mtt to 10us!
IrLAP, no activity on link!
IrLAP, no activity on link!
IrLAP, no activity on link!
IrLAP, no activity on link!
previous versions were OK

Michal
