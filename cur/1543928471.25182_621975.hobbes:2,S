The short story....
kbuild knows that .o files listed with obj-m are modules.
So if you have:
   obj-m := foo.o
the kbuild will know that it has to build a module named foo.o.
If foo.o consist of composite objects then kbuild
is told so using:
    foo-y := bar.o baz.o
So in this case kbuild will build bar.o and baz.o and
use these for the resulting module named foo.
When building baz.o kbuild uses make to search for the source file.
First it look for baz.c - if it fails it look for baz.s
Does both fail kbuild give up (there are some corner cases but ignore that).
When foo.o is ready is uses some linker magic to link in version information
and the end result is foo.ko.
foo.ko has a number of unresolved symbols that are:
1) during build time checked if kernel or other modules define them
2) during load time they are resolved
The above is general stuff - if you need more details please be specific.
