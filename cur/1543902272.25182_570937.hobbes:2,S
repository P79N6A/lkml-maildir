Interestingly, the above accurately describes a common code pattern 
matching code which caused gcc to emit the uninit'd-var warnings.
For the record I think initializating 'f0' to zero is safer for the 
reasons Linus gave, and in addition, f0 is or'd with a value written to 
a hardware register, which means things should go awry (if they go) in a 
semi-predictable manner.
According to the assembly language produced, sure it is larger -- by one 
(per function) MOV that is adjacent to other initializations, making it 
highly likely the initializations are all streamed together.  I doubt 
one MOV per function will make a huge difference, considering the peace 
of mind it buys.
