Well, a nice way to do this is: (probably not syntactically correct..)
router# iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i lan0 -p tcp ! -s 
local.netework/12 -d ip.of.lan0 --dport 25 -j DROP
Depending on how your network is set up, this may or may not work... my 
server box itself is masq'd so this works nicely on my network.
