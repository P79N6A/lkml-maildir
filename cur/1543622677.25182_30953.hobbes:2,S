Subject: Docs for /proc for 2.4.17 or how to tune cacheing?

Hello,
I have a linux box with 2.4.17 running and 512 MB ram.
While normal system running I have about 110 MB cache, 20 MB buffer, 150
mb free and the rest used mem.
As I have no tasks that will fork much or grow in size I think it would be
great to lower the size of free mem and rise the size of cache and buffer.
I undestand that this can be done with /proc/ and I looked in /proc/sys/vm
but only can see:
bdflush  kswapd  max-readahead  min-readahead  overcommit_memory
page-cluster  pagetable_cache
Here is the point I get stuck because I do not find any up to date docs
for /proc
Thanks for your time
Alexander Newald
