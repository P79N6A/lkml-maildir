I thought Luc Verhaegen figured that out not Keith.
Call it whatever you want and I have wasted far too much time arguing
with you and Keith and I can never get agreement on anything.  BTW,
should I search the LKML archives and find the messages where you call
me stupid and block my patches merging fbdev/DRM? That's effectively
what you are doing right now.
There is a significant group of Linux users who want to be able to
login separate users to each screen/head/crtc/output device. These
people are concentrated in the third world and don't show up at OLS to
argue their case.
There is another group that wants Unicode consoles. The people I
talked to were from India and Japan.
I am not a member of either group. So go ahead and ignore me, I'd just
like to see these two groups get features implemented that have been
ignored for a long time.
