Right, but from a user-mode point of view it means at least one extra 
instruction.

Trivial, perhaps, but it requires a call/ret pair in userspace, which is 
   a fairly expensive form of push/pop.

Oh, so you're not going to do the "read from stack" thing?  (Agreed, by 
the way, on the CPU design -- both SYSENTER and SYSCALL suck.  SYSCALL 
was changed rather substantially in x86-64 for that reason.)
