Probably there will be two fields where a subset of C++ would give a big
save to the kernel:
- All that 'hand-coded' object orientation ans inheritance makes tons of
  structs repeating function pointers and the like, and using tricky
  rules to be sure nobody creates a class without a pure virtual method
  (funtion pointer). Binary space.
- You are doing in source code what the compiler should do for you.

There is no point in interfaccing C and C++. But a full C++-subset kernel
would be equally fast and probably safer to write code for that this.
But things are like they are. Kernel is C.
