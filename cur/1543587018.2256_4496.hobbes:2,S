UNIX power users do know better.  They know their ISPs mail
server could show up in RSS or ORBS any moment. Therefor they
use their own machines for sending out email.
IMHO DUL is an unethical list to use because it assumes guilty
by default. This is different from all other spam blocking lists,
which only block hosts _after_ they've found something wrong with
them.
The other exception is untestable-netblocks.orbs.org, which blocks
everything it cannot test and is just as bad as DUL.
Anyway, since linux-kernel has chosen to not receive email from me
I won't bother answering VM bugreports or anything here. It's up to
Matti and Davem to decide how useful a place linux-kernel will be.
