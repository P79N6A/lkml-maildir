OK, I am sure this is my problem but I have no idea why you are
describing down_trylock as undocumented - I simply took it out of page
111 of the "Linux Device Drivers" book - hardly the canonical source but
why are you telling me that it is undocumented?
The down_trylock is used here so that a passed in packet and the regular
every second check that the device has not been hot-unplugged don't
deadlock. If I used down then a deadlock is a near certainty. It simply
bounces the 1 second test here if the lock is already down. Is that a
big problem?

Well, they don't seem a mess to me, but I can document them, though I
thought thety were pretty self-documenting :( One locks the waiting
queue of packets, one the queue of output packets.

Again, it is trying to avoid a deadlock between injected packets and
scans for hotplug events.

You are right about that and it should be fixed
