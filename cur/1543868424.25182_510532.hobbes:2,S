Well you could always try to just change the setting to see if you find
one where the interrupts are happy.  If you change the setting by one at
a time, you should only have to try 4 positions to get one that works
since that is how many interrupts PCI has.

Well reasonably you shouldn't have to.

You need lspci -v to get interrupt information.

That unfortunately only shows interrupts in use by active drivers.
