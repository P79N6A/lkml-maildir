Subject: [PATCH] [POWERPC] Fix initial lmb add region with a non-zero base
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/13/227

If we add to an empty lmb region with a non-zero base we will not coalesce
the number of regions done to one.  This causes problems on ppc32 for the
memory region as its assumed to only have one region.
We can fix this be easily specially casing the initial add to just replace
the dummy region.

Posting this since Dave's looking a pulling the lmb code out into lib/ and
sharing it between powerpc and sparc.
