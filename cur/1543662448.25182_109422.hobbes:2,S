Well they are already there, but you have your geography somewhat
mixed up. Microsoft has built a 'campus' in India. The facility
'looks' like a college and has dormitories and a "student-union"
building (cafeteria). They will tap the cheap labor and re-write
Windows so it actually works. They will do this at 1/100th the
cost of maintaining the current Redmond operation. That building
will be sold within the next 5 years, just watch!

keep it quiet. There's a lot of junk out there. They just rename
it junque to keep the price up.
