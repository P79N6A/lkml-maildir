My testing yesterday was done with a Xircom RBEM58G-100 (10/100 + 56k) and an
Aironet PC4800 (with xircom_tulip_cb and airo/airo_cs, respectively).
Since this may be a driver problem, I should note that the airo drivers are
from pcmcia-cs-3.1.33.

I'm finding it really difficult to replicate this problem today, but if I
find anything else that may be of use to help shed more light on this
issue, I'll be sure and share it.
