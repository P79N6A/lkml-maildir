Wrong. Negative dentries are very useful for caching negative lookups:
look at the average startup sequence of any program linked with glibc, and
depending on your setup you will notice how it tries to open a _lot_ of a
files that do not exist (the "depending on your setup" comes from the fact
that it depends on things like how quickly it finds your "locale" setup
from its locale path - you may have one of the setups that puts it in the
first location glibc searches etc).
If you don't cache those negative lookups, you will do a low-level
filesystem lookup for each of those failures, which is _expensive_.
However, you're right that it probably doesn't help to do this after
"unlink()" - it's probably only worth doing when actually doing a
"lookup()" that fails.
