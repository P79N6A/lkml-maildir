Oh.
Ok. That one I've actually never had any problems with, even though _I_
haven't used /usr/src/linux in a long time. 
I think it asks the user where the kernel tree is when it does its
configuration. It's not the only question either, so it doesn't sound like
a problem (maybe it _defaults_ to /usr/src/linux, and that may be fine:
it's likely to be the kernel the distribution came with, so..

You're right, right now kernel modules need some way of specifying where
the kernel is. I've always just had a define at the top of a makefile that
the user actually had to edit by hand (this was how early USB-development
was done, for example). Not very pretty, I guess. But at least it doesn't
screw the "normal" user packages.
