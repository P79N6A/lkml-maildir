OK, so they could be calculated on the fly in the elevators, I suppose.
But what would the value be?  Right now we use the nonrotational flag to
basically not bother with plugging (no point if no seek penalty) on
certain events where we'd previously have waited for other I/O to join.
But that's really a seek penalty parameter rather than the idea of read
or write costing (although the elevators usually track these dynamically
anyway ... as part of the latency calculations but not explicitly).
