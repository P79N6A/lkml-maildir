(Hmm, I'm replying at the point in the email I'm replying to.  Is what
I'm doing in this current email ok - i.e the one you replied to looked
like pure top-posting - or do you actually want pure bottom posting?)

Then how about making it depend on CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX?  It's the
only LSM actually using that field right now.  (As more come along, we
can use a hidden CONFIG_SECURITY_ATTRS or somesuch bool select'ed by
LSMs which need it)
Using CONFIG_SECURITY means that if you compile with SECURITY=n, you get
the capability module but no task->security.  If you compile with
SECURITY=y but no modules, you get the dummy module and a
task->security field!
