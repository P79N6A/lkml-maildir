I've heard this before, but noone seems to have tested it yet. You know,
this is a couple of lines of change in ll_rw_blk.c and blkdev.h to
support this. Any reason you haven't done that, benched, and submitted
something to that effect? I'll even walk you through the 2.5 changes
needed to do this:
blkdev.h:
	unsigned short max_sectors;
change to
	unsigned short max_sectors[2];
ll_rw_blk.c:
	ll_back_merge_fn()
	if (req->nr_sectors + bio_sectors(bio) > q->max_sectors) {
change to
	if (req->nr_sectors + bio_sectors(bio) > q->max_sectors[rq_data_dir[req]) {
Ditto for ll_front_merge_fn() and ll_merge_requests_fn(). The line in
attempt_merge() can be killed.
	generic_make_request()
	BUG_ON(bio_sectors(bio) > q->max_sectors);
change to
	BUG_ON(bio_sectors(bio) > q->max_sectors[bio_data_dir(bio)];
And do the trivial thing to blk_queue_max_sectors() as well. Now all you
need to do is change ide-probe.c to set the values you want.
