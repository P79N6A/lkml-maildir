Subject: [PATCH 2/6] UML - Update Kconfig help
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/8/288

The MODE_TT help was a little outdated.  This updates it in light of the
existence of skas0 mode.
It's also turned off by default since it is mostly obsoleted by skas0 mode.
