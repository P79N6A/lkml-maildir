Done. Removed all le16_to_cpu's.
Comments are OK. Just a little bit busy on my regular work. So can give
responses not so quickly as you probably wanted.

It's a driver description you asked for previously.
Commit message should look like this probably:
"Port of adutux driver from 2.6 kernel for Ontrak ADU boards."
Devices list:
As I said previously supported devices are:
http://www.ontrak.net/products.htm#Table
%205
Just to list them here:
ADU100, ADU120, ADU130, ADU200, ADU208, ADU218.
Testing is performed on ADU200.
But command structure is identical for this devices and it is only
individual command syntax that varies between different ADU devices.

There is not maintainer for this device in 2.6.
Following Pete notes I will rework code and give it for review once again.
As I said it's usb-skeleton approach that I reused during the port.
Anyway, will get back to this soon.
