I would suggest you take it up with the supplier, given EU law on product
being fit for the purpose for which it was sold I would hope they jump.
Seriously it isn't going to be worth anyones time fighting binary crap
when there are open alternatives available. Tell HP to replace it with a
working card - also if you mail ordered it remember your EU wide 14 day
return option ;)
And please don't post pieces of proprietary driver code to the kernel
list - I doubt you have permission to do so from HP.
