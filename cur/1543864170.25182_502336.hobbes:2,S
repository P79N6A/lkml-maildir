Sure... it's the DL380 G2 that used to be zeus.kernel.org.  It's not 
ideal (in particular, I would have preferred a 64-bit machine), but it 
has the advantage that it's proven itself rock-solid over the years, it 
has all the hands-off management features, we have it, and it has 6 GB RAM.
As far as filesystem is concerned, we might decide to use this machine 
to test out XFS.  Haven't made the formal decision yet.
