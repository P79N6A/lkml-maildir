In this case you have to "rmmod dummyphp; modprobe dummyphp showunused=1" to 
get all slots and try to enable the device. We have tested it once with a 
special PCI debugging board where we can electrically disable the PCI bus so 
we don't kill our hardware. The problem was that on reenabling a interrupt 
storm killed the machine, I don't remember the exact problem. IIRC it looked 
like the kernel found the device but the PCI bridge got confused by the new 
device (or something like this). I don't know if there is a way to survive 
this situation as the bridges in "normal" hardware are not hotplug aware. 
Greg?
If there is a way I will try to impleement it, but for now this is beyound my 
knowledge.
