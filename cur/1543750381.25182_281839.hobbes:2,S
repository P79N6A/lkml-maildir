I got a similar problem on FC3, but it doesn't have anything to do
with pktcdvd. The hal daemon is leaking a file descriptor when
checking a data DVD that doesn't contain a file system.
The effect is that /dev/hdc is kept open which makes eject attempts
from non-root users fail.
Here is a patch to fix the leak. I think it will apply also to the hal
cvs tree.
