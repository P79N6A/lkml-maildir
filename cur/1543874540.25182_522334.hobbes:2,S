Well, by "additional problems" _I_ mean things like "a warning turned into 
a fatal oops and didn't get logged at all".
That's a lot more serious than "there were a few extra entries in the 
traceback that caused us some confusion".
And yes, we had exactly that case happen several times.

With callbacks, it's actually often nice to see the callback data that is 
on the stack (and it's very obvious from the "<function+0>" ksymtab 
explanation: you can't have a <function+0> that is anything but a callback 
pointer (since it isn't a return address).
