Well, it's kind of odd nowadays to have the freedom of arbitrary alignment.

Yes, aligned(2) is enough.

Same here, we need input from the 64-bit world (or make it aligned(8)).

I agree that there may be compilers out there that actually pads the
structure to make the members unaligned. So you are correct, aligned()
should be used to be safe (until memory allocation routines start to return
unaligned addresses).
Will you send this upstream to Andrew?
Thanks for the quick response!
