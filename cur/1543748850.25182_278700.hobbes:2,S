a good number of generic bits (generic irq subsystem, preemption
fixes/enhancements, lock initializer cleanups, and tons of fixes found
in -RT) are upstream or in -mm already, but the core PREEMPT_RT stuff is
still under development and thus not ready for upstream. I'm constantly
sending independent bits (fixes or orthogonal improvements) that show up
in -RT towards upstream as well. [-RT would be a 1MB unmaintainable
patch otherwise.]
