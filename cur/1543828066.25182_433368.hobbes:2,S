Not directly - the kernel will create a fallback aperture if it can't
find one provided by the BIOS. The default is 64MB, but it can be
enlarged with iommu=memaper=4 
There was also a bug that might have caused this over longer uptimes. 
If you still see  it with latest 2.6.16.stable (19 or so). 
If it still happens with those two changes then something is likely
leaking mappings or your have a extreme workload that needs
a lot of mappings.

Yes you'll get 64MB fallback likely.

Probably yes.
