Somebody who's familliar with the code (as opposed to me) might be
able to point to a specific patch, but you could also try doing a
bisection search with  git bisect  to try and find the patch between
2.6.13 and 2.6.14-rc1 that broke it for you. A few handfuls of kernel
compiles/boots usually does the trick.
Search the archives for details, it's been described numerous times.
