There is IDE maintainer for 2.4:
Andre Hedrick <andre@linux-ide.org> [09 apr 2002]
	ATA/ATAPI Storage Architect [2.0,2.2,2.4]
	HBA interface developer
	Serial ATA Architect [future release]
	Voting NCITS member AT-Attachment Committee
Ask him what details he needs and maybe he will be able to help.
