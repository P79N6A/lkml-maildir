Perhaps interrupt moderation could be of help here (say - switch to lesser  
interrupts per unit of time when running on battery), which I find that  
the e1000 driver doesn't employ in the kernel presently. (For interrupt  
moderation, refer:  
http://download.intel.com/design/network/applnots/ap450.pdf.
)
Without the side-effect of experiencing a link-flap when switching to a  
lower-speed (with its toll in terms of down-time for auto-negotiation,  
STP, etc), the Interrupt Moderation Algorithm dynamically adjusts the  
number of interrupts based on traffic - and presumably consume less power.  
For an "Optimise for Power" kind of profile - the driver can be loaded  
with a higher throttle rate during boot-time.
