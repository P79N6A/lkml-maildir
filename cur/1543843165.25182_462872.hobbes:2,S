You mean unused.

I was not talking about free pages, and I don't think Rik was either.
The idea is to be lazy about the make-volatile calls. Put the pages for
which a make-volatile call should be done to some array/list and do a
bulk make-volatile. These pages are still in the page/swap cache. The
trouble is we have to be sure these pages have not been freed in the
meantime.
The bulk set-unused/set-stable to the buddy allocator should not be to
problematic. We just have to find new places where to do the calls.
