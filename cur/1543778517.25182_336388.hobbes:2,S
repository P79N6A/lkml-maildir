For data=writeback only, yes?

Rather than performing this test on each ->prepare_write(), would it not be
better to set up a new set of address_space_operations for this mode?
__nobh_prepare_write() seems like a poor choice of name?

Here too, perhaps.

Suggest you make this static and update the comment.

What's going on here?  Seems that we'll call get_block() with `create=0'. 
Is there any point in doing that?  For delayed allocation we shuld be able
to skip get_block() altogether here and, err, delay it.

Here you add nobh_dalloc_prepare_write() and remember to export it to
modules this time ;)
