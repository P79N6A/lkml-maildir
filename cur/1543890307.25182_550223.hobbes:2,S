OK. So you have to assume the users know what they're doing. :-)
In reality though, the policy of allowing ordinary users to set affinity 
on their tasks should be rethought.
In any case, there's no point having cpu affinity if it's going to be 
ignored.  Maybe you could have two levels of affinity: 1. if set by a 
root it must be obeyed; and 2. if set by an ordinary user it can be 
overridden if the best interests of the system dictate.  BUT I think 
that would be a bad idea.
