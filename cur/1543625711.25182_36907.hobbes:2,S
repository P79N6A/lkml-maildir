Hi
 I have already complained about kernel 2.5.5 which had probles
compiling raid and lvm modules
 the problem is STILL CONTINUING !!!
 and newly,
 i tried to add ide-scsi emulation also ( for my CD-RW)
 and that ended up with this
--- snipped ---

--------------------
 i went int the directory where the makefile, MAINTAINERS ... files
are present ( i.e the root of the kernel tree ) and
then tried both the 2.5.6 and the pre3 patch
patch =p0 < "path to the unzipped patch file "
 and the patch is giving lots of errors
 i am not sure if i am doing any mistake in the patching ; as far as i
know this is the proper method of patching the kernel source using the
patch downloaded from kernel.org
 I DID NOT get any response to my previous mail regarding kernel 2.5.5
although th full version of kernel has been removed from the site for
which i was happy - but a reply could have been more better to know if
you are still taking our feedbacks
 Linux is a community effort and if i am not being answered then it
makes no sense in building up linux to extent of workd domination over
all other OS !
