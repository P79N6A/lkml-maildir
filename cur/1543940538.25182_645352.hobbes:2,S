Well you moved the code at minimum. Hmmm... according 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=120114755620891&w=2
 it was Robin.

No idea what you are talking about.

But then the ptep_clear_flush will issue invalidate_page() for ranges 
that were already covered by invalidate_range(). There are multiple calls 
to clear the same spte.

This is referrring to the remap issue not do_wp_page right?

Ok.
The serialization of remap_file_pages does not seem that critical since we 
only take a read lock on mmap_sem here. There may already be concurrent 
access to pages from other processors while the ptes are remapped. So 
there is already some overlap.
We could take mmap_sem there writably and keep it writably for the case 
that we have an mmu notifier in the mm.
