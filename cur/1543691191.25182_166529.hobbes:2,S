When suspending to mem, actually it "looks like" it suspends. The only
thing is that the LCD stays "light grey" (yep, I know it is not a
technical description... :). In order to resume, I have to press the
thinkpad power button (tap it, if I hold it for several seconds, it just
powers off). When resuming, there must be a problem with interrumpts (NIC
and Trackpoint stop working). So, it is not "immediate"

Suspend to disk does not work (If I don't kill artsd, cf. previous
message). If I kill artsd first, :
Stopping tasks:

In both cases, when suspending to disk, it returns immediately.
