That will be fine then.  I misconstrued your first statements as
indicating that we should duplicate this code in each arch (which
I didn't like).  As far as PPC is concerned, go ahead and wipe
out early_serial_setup when you bring in early_register_port.
FWIW, there's actually been more PPC platforms than ev64260 using
early_serial_setup. They had abandoned it temporarily for a less
flexible approach due to the breakage.
