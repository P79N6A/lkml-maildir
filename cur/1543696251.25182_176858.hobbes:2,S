Huh?  I'm running -test9-mm2 with the minion stuff as I'm typing this.
Or are you talking about the general case if you have a wrapper for
a 2.4 kernel?  If so, then yes, you'll need to do some programming to
get the wrapper to do things the 2.6 way (which is what minion's patch
basically does, it changes the NVidia 2.4 wrapper code to the 2.6 schemes).
