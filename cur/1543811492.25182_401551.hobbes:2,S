This code is irrelevant.  This is for MIDI emulation like emu10k1
WaveTable, not for the real MIDI device.
Basically the given behavior is not a bug.  The sequencer handles
note-on with velocity 0 as it is.  As a strict definition, note-off
and note-on with zero velocity are different although they are used
widely as identical in order to save bytes.
