Hi all,
Recently I'm interested on linux kernel development. I would like to write
patches (and, of course, post them in this list ;). In fact, I could say 
that
I have already a patch for the console frame buffer support for the 2.6
branch.
My actual development environment consists in a scratch vim editor, 
diff, patch
and gcc. My question is: ¿What kind of tools use you, the kernel gurus, to
write and debug code? ¿It's enough with vi and gcc?
Thank you in advance and excuse my poor english.
MaF
