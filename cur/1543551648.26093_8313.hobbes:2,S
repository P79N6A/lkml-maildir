It isn't _that_ bad. Besides, this "pointer mess" is ingrained in each C
programmer by now, to change that will get you hard to see bugs.

Rather trivial.

A struct in C++ is a class where the default visibility is public, nothing
else. And they _do_ impose an overhead via indirection to get the function
(they are essentially a function pinter in the struct) plus passing the
self pointer, which may need adjustment for bases and such. Trivial, but
could be important some places.

And are the stuff that makes C++ worthwile in the first place. I've written
very little C++, but being able to draw upon STL is mindboggling, but you
easily loose sight of what is going on behind the scenes.
