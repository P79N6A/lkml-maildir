proactive replacement before complete failure is a good idea and is
(just recently) on my todo list.  It shouldn't be too hard.

concrete suggestions are always welcome (though sometimes you might
have to put some effort into convincing me...)

If you look at the amount of code in the 'reshape raid5' patch you
will notice that it isn't really very much.  It reuses a lot of the
infrastructure that is already present in md/raid5.  So a reshape
actually uses a lot of code that is used very often.
Compare this to an offline solution (raidreconfig) where all the code
is only used occasionally.  You could argue that the online version
has more code safety than the offline version....
