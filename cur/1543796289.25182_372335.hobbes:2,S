Actually, it should probably be "sector_t", because it isn't really
possible to have a file with more blocks than the size of the block
device.  This avoids memory overhead for small systems that have no
need for it in a very highly-used struct.  It may be for some network
filesystems that support gigantic non-sparse files they would need to
enable CONFIG_LBD in order to get support for this.
Cheers, Andreas
