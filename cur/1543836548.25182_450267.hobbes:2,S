The problem is that Marcelo is very very busy those days (as you might have
noticed from the delay between each release), and there are a good bunch of
security fixes in -rc3 which should wait too much in -rc. Maybe an -rc4
would be OK, but I don't know if Marcelo has enough time to spend on yet
another RC. Otherwise, if I produce a 2.4.34-pre1 about one week after 2.4.33,
does that fit your needs ? I already have a few fixes waiting which might be
worth a first pre-release.
