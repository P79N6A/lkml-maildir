OK, then journal replay is again out of the picture...  It's just hard to
follow because one person says "journal replay will corrupt things", and
the other says "we aren't mounting filesystems".  No mounting == no journal
replay == no corruption.  This has nothing to do with swapfiles.

Two options:
1) You already have to store _some_ information about where to get the
   resume image from.  It sounds like you store the swap partition name
   on the kernel command-line or similar.  It should be equally possible
   to store the swap file partition name PLUS a relative offset from the
   start of the partition to where the swapfile starts.  You can easily
   get this via fstat+bmap on the swapfile.
2) You could require that the critical resume information be on a swap
   partition, but allow non-kernel data to be saved to the swapfile.
   If you can read the initial resume data from the swap partition, I'd
   have to imagine that you can read devno+block data from a swapfile
   without needing any of the filesystem code involved.  After all, the
   swap code doesn't depend on the filesystem either - it just makes a
   list of block numbers at swapfile activation time and does direct
   read/write to the device after that.
The lilo suggestion for doing the bmap could also be done, although
I don't see the need if the swap code has already mapped the entire
file in memory already.  Also note - while GRUB _examines_ the
filesystem (via internal fs-aware code), I don't think it acutally
mounts it or does journal replay, so it should be safe also if you
really wanted to go that way (I don't think you need to however).
Cheers, Andreas
