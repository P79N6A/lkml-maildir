Oops!  My mistake.  Mistook "andl" as "addl".

I suppose if you have a global pointer "current", you don't even need
to do "andl" instruction.  (But you will need to update "current"
whenever
a context switch happens, and you'll probably have a "current" array in 
the CMP version.)

I see.  
This question is not related, but if you want to know which process
is running on another CPU, which data structure tells you that?
