# Q: If you don't have initrd, where do you put this binary? 
# 
# A: In the kernel. Provide it with a set of pages which are to be put into 
# the user-space side of process #1, rather then exec'ing /sbin/init.
# 
# Also cute, and definitely sicker :)
Trying to win the Biggest-Kernel-Image award? :)
