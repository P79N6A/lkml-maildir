Writing a howto, or maybe writting a shellscript to do a translation
:-). It will not be trivial, but certainly better than trying to push
the badram patch. Good luck ;-).
(e820 map is available from dmesg after boot, and perhaps from other
places. First, you'll need to duplicate it on cmdline using
memmap=... arguments. Then, if bad ram is in the middle of something,
you'll need to split memmap= accordingly).
