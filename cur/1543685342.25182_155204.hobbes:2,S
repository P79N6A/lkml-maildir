Stupid me.
I mean I tested with 2.4.22-pre10 which is pretty current.
I mean, there were no changes to buffers code in between 2.4.22-pre10 .. 2.4.22-rc1

Since it did not help 2.4.22 code, I think 2.6.0 won't benefit from it too.
The testcase is really easy and everyone can reproduce the problem easily.
