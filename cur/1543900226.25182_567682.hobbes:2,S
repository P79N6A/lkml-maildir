I'd very much like to have it, but that is just me. We could take a
weight of 0 to mean disabling of that grouping and default to that. That
way it would not complicate regular behaviour.
It could be implemented with a simple hashing scheme where
sched_group_hash(tsk) and sched_group_cmp(tsk, group->some_task) could
be used to identify a schedule group.
pseudo code:
u64 sched_group_hash(struct task_struct *tsk)
{
	u64 hash = 0;
	if (tsk->pid->weight)
		hash_add(&hash, tsk->pid);
	if (tsk->pgrp->weight)
		hash_add(&hash, tsk->pgrp);
	if (tsk->uid->weight)
		hash_add(&hash, tsk->uid);
	if (tsk->container->weight)
		hash_add(&hash, tsk->container);
	...
	return hash;
}
s64 sched_group_cmp(struct task_struct *t1, struct task_struct *t2)
{
	s64 cmp;
	if (t1->pid->weight || t2->pid->weight) {
		cmp = t1->pid->weight - t2->pid->weight;
		if (cmp)
			return cmp;
	}
	...
	return 0;
}
u64 sched_group_weight(struct task_struct *tsk)
{
	u64 weight = 1024; /* 1 fixed point 10 bits */
	if (tsk->pid->weight) {
		weight *= tsk->pid->weight;
		weight /= 1024;
	}
	....
	return weight;
}
