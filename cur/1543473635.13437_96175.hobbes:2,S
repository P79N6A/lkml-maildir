This means that you can't change it and claim it's the GPL. If you want to
get it and create a JPL out of it, I'd assume you have to (a) be curteous
and ask the FSF if you can use their wording, and (b) get somebody in the
know (a lawyer experienced in copyright matters) look it over.
Why not take this matter to news:gnu.misc.discuss, where it belongs?
