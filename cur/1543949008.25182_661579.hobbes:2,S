I'd call it dev_pm_state, in analogy with dev_pm_info etc.

In fact 'sleeping' doesn't look good in this context.  'pm_state' seems
better to me (although it is confusingly similar to 'power_state', we're going
to get rid of the latter anyway).

I don't like this name, but I have no better idea at the moment.

Hmm.
Suppose we add a mutex to dev_pm_info, say pm_mtx, and require it to be:
(1) taken by suspend_device(dev) (at the beginning)
(2) released by resume_device(dev) (at the end)
(3) taken (and released) by device_pm_add() if dev is the parent of the device
    being added.
In that case, device_pm_add() will block on attepmpts to register devices whose
parents are suspended (or suspending) and we're done.  At least so it would
seem.

The error codes are a bit unusual, but whatever.

This seems to be a weak spot.  The resuming of the device at this point need
not work correctly, given that the system's target state is still a sleep
state.
