Off-topic. This is a common pattern. Perhaps it makes sense to
introduce a try_to_freeze_or_thaw_and_return_an_error() helper.

Why this change? We are doing kthread_stop() + set_cpus_allowed() on
return. Imho,
		if (IS_ERR(p))
			goto out_allowed;
		goto out_thread;
looks a bit better. Yes we need a couple of error labels at the end.

As it was already discussed, this is racy. As Srivatsa (imho rightly)
suggested, kthread_stop(p) should thaw process itself. This also allows
us to kill at least some of wait_for_die loops.
However, the change in kthread_stop(p) in not enough to close the race.
We can check kthread_should_stop() in refrigerator(), this looks like
a most simple approach for now.
Alternatively, Srivatsa suggests to introduce a new task_lock() protected
task_struct->freezer_state (so we can reliably set FE_ALL). Surely this is
more poweful, but needs more changes. I am not sure. Perhaps we can do
this later.
In any case, imho "try3" should add thaw_process() to kthread_stop().
Gautham, Srivatsa, do you agree?
Oleg.
