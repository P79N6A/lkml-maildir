Subject: [PATCH 9 of 10] ipath - fix null deref during rdma ops
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/23/170

The problem was that node A's sending thread, which handles sending RDMA
read response data, would write the trigger word, the last packet would
be sent, node B would send a new RDMA read request, node A's interrupt
handler would initialize s_rdma_sge, then node A's sending thread would
update s_rdma_sge.  This didn't happen very often naturally but was more
frequent with 1 byte RDMA reads.  Rather than adding more locking or
increasing the QP structure size and copying sge data, I modified the
copy routine to update the pointers before writing the trigger word to
avoid the update race.
