Subject: [patch 1/2] s390: klist bus_find_device & driver_find_device callback.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/22/213

[patch 1/2] s390: klist bus_find_device & driver_find_device callback.
Add bus_find_device() and driver_find_device() which allow searching for a
device in the bus's resp. the driver's klist and obtain a reference on it.
This version now increases the reference count for the device to be returned.
Also, the interface has been exported to GPL modules and the comments have
been improved.
