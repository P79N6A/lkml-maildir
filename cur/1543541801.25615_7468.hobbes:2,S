Very true. And forks/attributes are just one case of many.
For example, directory change callbacks for file browsers (as opposed to  
re-statting the stuff on a timer).
Similar stuff for a process browser.
Trashcan support for file deletions. (If it's not in the OS, command line  
file deletion behaves very different from GUI file deletion.)
Or for s/OS/protocol/, parsing support for a GUI FTP program.
I'm sure there is lots more on the list.
