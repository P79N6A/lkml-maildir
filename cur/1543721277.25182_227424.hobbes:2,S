I (hopefully correctly) assume that one of the old ones is AT keyboard.
What happens when I press a key on keyboard and the application that
has the keyboard somehow on it's stdin reads a key? What happens between
the two events and how does it travel inside the kernel?
I know how the keys can be read from port 0x60 or whichever.
