You may have done that, but the CKRM/ResGroups independently decided a
long time ago that the fundamental unit was the resource class, and
the OpenVZ folks decided that the fundamental unit was the
BeanCounter, and the CPUSet folks decided that the fundamental unit
was the CPUSet, etc ... :-)
But there's a lot of common ground between these different approaches,
and potential for synergy, so the point of this patch set is to
provide a unification point for all of them, and a stepping stone for
other new resource controllers and process control modules.
