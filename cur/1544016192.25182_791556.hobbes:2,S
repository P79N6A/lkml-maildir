Ok, can you now try to upgrade just the kernel? IOW, it would be good to 
try to figure out what it is that triggers this problem.

Yes, now I see a new bridge:
	08:00.0 PCI bridge: PLX Technology, Inc. PEX8112 x1 Lane PCI Express-to-PCI Bridge (rev aa) (prog-if 00 [Normal decode])
and behind this bridge is this:
	09:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV505 [Radeon X1550 Series] (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
	09:00.1 Display controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV505 [Radeon X1550 Series] (Secondary)

Yup. It's all ok.

Well, your dmesg is now from a 2.6.27 kernel, so I'd like to double-check 
and verify that upgrading the kernel really works now. It does sound like 
some non-kernel-related issue, but still..
