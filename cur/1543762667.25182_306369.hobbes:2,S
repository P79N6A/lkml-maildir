Pure unmitigated bull-shit. I measure (with hardware devices)
the execution time of real code in modern CPUs. I do this for
a living so you don't have to stand in line for a couple of
hours to have your baggage scanned at the airport.
Always, always, a call will be more expensive than a branch
on condition. It's impossible to be otherwise. A call requires
that the return address be written to memory (the stack),
using register indirection (the stack-pointer).
If somebody said; "I think that the code will look better
and the few cycles lost will not be a consequence with modern
CPUs...", then there is a point. But coming up with this
disingenuous bullshit is something else.
