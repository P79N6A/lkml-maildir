We're actually doing the converse of this in the sched-domain
scheduler. Processes have a tendancy to follow the interrupts
(ie. try to get onto the same CPU as them).
This makes good interrupt balancing important.
I have a feeling it might be best to keep the interrupts on
the closest CPUs, and move processes to match. Or possibly a
mix of both approaches.
