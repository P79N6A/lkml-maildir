Hi Frédéric,
Yeah, that might work. I think you can even embed waiters_count inside
the lock. I think this can be
done with minimal changes and with no overhead added to the lock
functions. Maybe use bits 7-0 for waiters_count and move the readers
count up 8 bits.
To make room for writers_count I'd change read_lock from:
static inline void __raw_read_lock(raw_rwlock_t *rw)
{
        asm volatile(LOCK_PREFIX " subl $1,(%0)\n\t"
                     "jns 1f\n"
                     "call __read_lock_failed\n\t"
                     "1:\n"
                     ::LOCK_PTR_REG (rw) : "memory");
}
To:
static inline void __raw_read_lock(raw_rwlock_t *rw)
{
        asm volatile(LOCK_PREFIX " subl $0x100,(%0)\n\t"
                     "jns 1f\n"
                     "call __read_lock_failed\n\t"
                     "1:\n"
                     ::LOCK_PTR_REG (rw) : "memory");
}
I think that's all you'd need to change for read_lock. For write_lock
you'd have to subtract (RW_LOCK_BIAS - 1) instead of just RW_LOCK_BIAS
during lock and add it back for unlock. You'd also have to change the
tests a little to ignore bits 7-0.
Regards,
Mandeep
