   I know this is offtopic, but the spam problem is getting worse,
   could the linux-kernel mail guy/gal, do something, the nigerian
   scams are actually dangerous.
They never make it to the lists, if they are sending these
spams to you privately that is your problem to resolve :-)
Look we simply cannot control what web site archives of these
lists choose to do with the sender's email address.  If you
post here, you will almost certainly get on a spam list.
There is zero we as postmasters can do about this.
