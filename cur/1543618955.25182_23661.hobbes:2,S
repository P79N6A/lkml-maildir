The reason why i ask is because i was experiencing font corruption with 
MTRRs enabled and X segfaulting with 4.x and a VIA Apollo pro (mostly 
because with 3.3.6 i never setup the MTRRs myself) and a friend of mine was
seeing corruption plus the occasional lockup with his KT133. Disabling MTRRs
solved both our lockup problems, mind you i soon switched back to my older
440BX setup and my problems went away. I also asked about FB because my particular card 
(ATI Rage IIC) never gets MTRRs working in X4.1 unless i have it FB 
enabled.
