	I realize that. But that has nothing to do with what I said, which 
analyzes only those rights you have without agreeing to the GPL by 
virtue of the fact that you possess the work and were not subject to 
any restrictions in the process of acquiring and using it.

	Your generalization doesn't apply because of several major 
differences between most software licenses and the GPL:
	1) Most software licenses do not grant everyone the right to use the 
work covered.
	2) Most software licenses do not grant anyone the right to create 
derived works.
	3) Most software licenses require your assent before you can use the 
covered work, in fact, most require your assent before you have the 
right to possess the covered work.
	However, one sticky point is that the GPL talks about 'modifying' a 
work. You can create derived works without modifying the original 
work and the GPL is unclear in this respect. However, I would argue 
that linking to a library file is using it and including a header 
file in your C code is using it. After all, there is nothing else you 
can do with such files.
