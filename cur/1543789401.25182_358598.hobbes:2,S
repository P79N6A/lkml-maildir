Welcome to the painful real world of software engineering.
Every software has bugs and if you want to ever get a release out you
have to make such decisions sometimes. 
As an alternative I can just backout the patch that enables the Intel
SRAT code. That is probably better for a short term fix and will
not regress anybody.
