Well the same code could also be used to disable C states on buggy
hardware. On my Fujitsu Lifebook p2120 C states are enabled, but don't
work. But we don't have currently anything in place to fix them or
disable them. And enabling C states on amd76x could be a cmdline option.

The C states on amd76x are quite usable. The only problem I had on my
Tyan s2460 was the some BIOS bug puts the machine into sleep at first
when they're enabled :) This does not happen on other systems.
