Absolutely sure, renamed nvidia.ko(and checked after booting through 
lsmod) and  hanged or restarted as always.
I don't know why normal boot without this module and init=/bin/bash and 
manual start of klogd both leave completely nothing in logs(kern.log, 
messages and syslog, as these boots never happened)
