This is an issue. But compared to todays situation where we
only do the checks occasionaly and we miss single object modules
we can live with having to deal with duplicate symbols occasionally.

Agreed. Maybe we shall let reference_init.pl report anonymous data and
skip that from the runtime part (if I find a way to detact it).
I will give it a spin later to see where I end up.
