I got this one and as I have said I will come up with the path soon:)

Can you please clarify my concern here.
Currently I am handling both the surprise removal and the eject request in the same
way, i,e send the notification to the userland and the usermode agent scripts
is responsible for offlining of all the devices and then echoing onto eject file.
My worry is if we implement a generic handler for BUS_CHECK, then what would you 
do if the device fails to remove, i.e what action to take if the device remove fails?
Thanks,
Anil
