Hi everyone,
At university I am currently dealing with file indexing/query features
as they exist in the BeFS or SkyFS. In BeFS you could commit a query like:
(name == "*.c" || name == "*.h" ) && size > 20000
API functions were available to commit such queries which would use some 
attribute b-tree to find matching files.
Now to get to the point: I would like to implement such functionality on 
a very basic level (Only very simple queries) for a fs in the linux 
kernel. I thought of parsing files in userland, extracting any usable 
meta-data (such as id3 tags) and storing them as extended attributes of 
the respective
files.
My problem is that I am not sure on which approach I should take on 
this. Should I attempt to hack such functionality into an existing fs ? 
If so, which one would be suited best? Maybe the much discussed 
reiser4-plugin-interface could actually be useful for this one?
I also considered using FiST (
http://www.am-utils.org/project-fist.html,
 
stackable filesystem language)
but the development seems to be stalled, I am having issues with 
compilation, the author doesn't respond
and I read about people having major issues with it (segfaults etc..)
Finally there is the option of using FUSE, but I have to admit I haven't 
had a closer look at it yet.
I hope this posting isn't so clueless&chaotic that people can't be 
bothered to answer :) I'd be thankful
for any word of advice and/or pointers on this topic.
regards,
Tobi
