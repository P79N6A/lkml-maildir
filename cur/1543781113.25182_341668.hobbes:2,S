Sometimes (very seldom) it also hangs if the AC adapter is plugged in, so I 
tested some more and found another interesting fact: It boots just fine if I 
use splash=verbose insted of splash=silent (even without AC adapter). I've 
patched the kernel with fbsplash-0.9.2-r4-2.6.13-rc[16].
Any idea what could be the cause?
