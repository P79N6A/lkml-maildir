This bug causes nfsd kernel based server to wrongly truncate files while using
offsets over 4G. With patch applied it starts to work right.
~(size_t) 0 is wrong too because size_t on IA32 is mere 32bit and as second
because ~0 is negative I think also causing a remote security issue since users
can truncate files to a negative offset this way.
Same below patch is valid for 2.4.0-test10-pre4 and 2.2.18pre17.

2.2.18pre17aa1 include the fix as part of the lfs patch.
