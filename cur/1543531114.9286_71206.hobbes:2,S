Probably mlockall() and then wake up periodically checking for low-memory.
If it gets below a certain threshold, use some magic voodoo heuristics
(loaded from a configuration file likely) and kill something.

While everything else is paging to disk, I would assume the above program
would get lots of time since it's the only thing left that can run.  I
haven't tried it, but it would make sense.
