The cache trashing will affect all programs handling large files:
mkisofs * > iso
dd < /dev/hdx42 | gzip > imagefile
perl -pe's/filenamea/filenameb/' < iso | cdrecord - # <- never tried
Changing a few programs will only partly cover the problems.
I guess the solution would be using random cache eviction rather than
a FIFO. I never took a look the cache mechanism, so I may very well be
wrong here.
