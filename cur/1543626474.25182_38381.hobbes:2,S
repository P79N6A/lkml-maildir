Subject: [PATCH] Process Accounting 32bit UID/GID support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

(Apologies to anyone getting this as a dupe, my first mail 
 bounced)
After receiving a handful of bug reports about process accounting
not working properly with 32bit UID/GID's, and investigating the
problem, I discovered the reason was that it just was not 
implemented yet.  After briefly discussing this with Alan and 
Arjan, I've created support for this feature, while maintaining 
full binary backward compatibility with existing tools.
I've also hacked the userland acct package (psacct in Red Hat
Linux) to support the new feature as well, while also remaining
backward compatible with kernels that do not have the new 32bit 
UID/GID patch.
Marcelo, could you add this to the 2.4.x queue?
TIA
