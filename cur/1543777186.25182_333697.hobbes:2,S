MBR size is 448 bytes, the rest is "the partition table", with space for four 
entries. If one wants more, then s/he creates a [primary] partition, tagging 
it "extended", and the "extended partiton table" is within that primary 
partition. So yes, by dd'ing /dev/hdX, you get everything. Including "lost 
sectors" if you dd it back to a bigger HD.
