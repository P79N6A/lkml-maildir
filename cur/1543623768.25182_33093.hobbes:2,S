One word of caution.
If you have a CPU that begin throttling it usually cut the CPU clock in
half and the rdtsc counter count half a fast.
You *should* actually call gettimeofday every few seconds (> 10) to
correct offset.
If you have a SMP system with impropper cooling you actually get into
trouble since you may have one CPU throttling alot and the other don't.
Then the rdtsc of the two CPU's may be quite different.
Have actually seen machines where sleep 1 took 1.2-1.4 secs!
