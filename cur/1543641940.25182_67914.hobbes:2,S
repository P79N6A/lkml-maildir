Sure! But that makes me want to throw up. Before I use that I would
implement my own ntfs inode cache alongside the VFS...
1) The iget5_locked + failing set() approach incurs an
alloc_inode()/destroy_inode() + a second find_inode() + second taking of
inode_lock, i.e. it is very expensive operation. 
2) It will return inodes that are I_FREEING or I_CLEAR. I will have to
test for these in NTFS and then iput() to wash my hands clean of such
garbage. And if I am not mistaken, the iput() actually will BUG().
3) My proposed ilookup() is fast and small so I would prefer that. And it
would seem quite a few other FS would be only too happy to see something
along those lines appear.
4) If anything, as Christoph Hellwig suggested to me on #kernel,
iget{,5}_locked() should be reimplemented in terms of my ilookup()
implementation and not vice versa. (-:
I suspect that point 2) may actually be an existing race condition in the
VFS. If someone does iget() or iget_locked(), whatever, at just the right
time, they could end up with a very weird struct inode which would BUG() 
on iput() if the code actually survives that long... - I haven't looked
into this closely so I may be missing something which doesn't allow these
BUG() scenarios to happen but from a cursory look around when I was
looking for a way to do the equivalent of ilookup() it would seem there
isn't... 
Thanks for your comments. It is interesting to read everyone's
suggestions...
Best regards,
	Anton
