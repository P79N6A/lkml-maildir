just to throw a little more weight onto the keyboard interaction, i can
nearly duplicate this.  i have a 486 machine that will flat out act like
molasses in penguinland if you unplug the keyboard.  pinging it will go from
.2ms up to about 10-50,000ms.  all processes running on the machine halt as
well.  a dozen seconds after plugging the keyboard back in, everything
returns to normal.  the first time this happened, i didn't realise the
keyboard had become disconnected and very nearly rebooted it due to the
excessive lag from my ssh connection.  this is not a ps2 keyboard.
this one is most like the above network timeout/halt bug.
i'd wager there are some funky keyboard interactions that exist out here in
userland.  i have another story.
i have two ps2 keyboards from the same manufacturer.  same brand,
everything.   i have a computer that is very finicky.  one of the keyboards
will -not- work when plugged into it.  linux reports keyboard timeouts on
bootup.  it will -not- work even if you unplug and replug it to reset it.
this keyboard works perfectly everywhere else that i've tried.
and yet another keyboard story.
i have another server that requires a power down/reset button everytime you
want to reboot it or the keyboard will not work.  it'll act like the above
keyboard.
...give me time and i'll find more keyboard issues =)
