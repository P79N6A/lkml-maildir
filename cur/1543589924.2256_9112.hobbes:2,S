I have some info at "
http://web.irridia.com/linux/"
 from an LPr having 
issues, including the dmidecode output and a mostly complete boot-time 
dmesg dump from an LPr and LP1000r.  The LPr was running 2.4.2-pre4 and 
the LP1000r is running 2.4.5-pre1, both without "noapic".  Please let me 
know if you need more info.
BTW, I have an isolated bank of redundant machines, one of which I can 
load down with heavy live load so I can test patches pretty easily.  
I'll do anything, including setting fire to a machine, if it'll help. :-)
