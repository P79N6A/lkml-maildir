This changes what is visible to user space, for the case
where we are not a member of a session of a process group.
By hashing the values these non-groups become available to
user space.  Which I find disturbing.  Before I can comment
further I need to see if there are any well defined semantics
for processes that are not part of a session or a process
group.  If there are well defined semantics we have just
broken user space.
