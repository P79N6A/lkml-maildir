Why can't this be done with a simple SUID helper to promote given
tasks to RT with sched_setschedule, doing essentially all the checks
this LSM is doing? 
Objections of "because it requires dangerous root or suid" don't fly,
an RT app under user control can DoS the box trivially. Never mind you
need root to configure the LSM anyway..
