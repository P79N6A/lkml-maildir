It would reduce clutter a little, but it'll never cover cases where the
arch is always virtualized.  You could move VMI there, but UML, PowerPC,
S/390 won't be moving.
I still think people expect virtualization under CPU features, so archs
should include the virt Kconfig explicitly there (rather than it just
appearing deep in drivers/).  At which point cut & pasting variations of
the CONFIG_VIRTUALIZATION option is probably as good as any other
solution, and far less work.
Cheers,
Rusty.
