Hello,
you probably know about this but i'll tell you anyway. there is a bug 
related to pctel modems. a very nice person made drivers for linux of 
this modems and they can work on linux. the problem is that when the 
modem finally dials after all the configuration, it puts out a "no 
carrier" message and disconnects. please handle the problem and if it 
was already fixed please reply to me and say which kernel i should download.
    Thank you, Boris Kimelman.
