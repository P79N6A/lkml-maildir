Hmm that gives me a lot of confidence ;-)  I'd hate to carry along bad
assumptions while we try to make this all kosher... but I'm willing to
defer to popular opinion on this one....

Well, one is...
static long * return_EIO_ptr(void)
{
        return ERR_PTR(-EIO);
}
...
static struct dentry *bad_inode_lookup(struct inode * dir,
                        struct dentry *dentry, struct nameidata *nd)
        __attribute__((alias("return_EIO_ptr")));
Maybe it'd be better to lose the alias in this case then?  and go back
to this:
static struct dentry *bad_inode_lookup(struct inode * dir,
                        struct dentry *dentry, struct nameidata *nd)
{
        return ERR_PTR(-EIO);
}
Thanks,
