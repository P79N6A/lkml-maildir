I have popped the patch stack back to including:
> trivial-cleanup-to-proc_check_chroot.patch
> proc-fix-the-inode-number-on-proc-pid-fd.patch
but not past that.  It boots now, unlike before with the full patch
stack.
I will continue the hunt.
Meanwhile, on the side,  I have a couple of permission problems to
report to Eric Biederman with apps that are complaining about not being
able to access /proc/<pid>/fd/[0-9]* files when before they could:
 1) Logged in as root, running "/bin/ls -l /proc/*/fd/*"
    causes some complaints.  For example:
    # /bin/ls -l /proc/2868/fd/?
    /bin/ls: cannot read symbolic link /proc/2868/fd/6: Permission denied
    /bin/ls: cannot read symbolic link /proc/2868/fd/7: Permission denied
    lr-x------ 1 root root 64 Feb 28 18:39 /proc/2868/fd/0 -> /dev/null
    lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Feb 28 18:39 /proc/2868/fd/1 -> /dev/pts/10
    lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Feb 28 18:39 /proc/2868/fd/2 -> /dev/pts/10
    lr-x------ 1 root root 64 Feb 28 18:39 /proc/2868/fd/3 -> /proc/sal/cmc/event
    lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Feb 28 18:39 /proc/2868/fd/4 -> /proc/sal/cmc/data
    l-wx------ 1 root root 64 Feb 28 18:39 /proc/2868/fd/6
    lr-x------ 1 root root 64 Feb 28 18:39 /proc/2868/fd/7
  
    I don't recall seeing any similar complaints before.  My first reaction
    is "wtf - I'm root - what's this permission denied error ?!?"
 2) I have an SGI specific application that runs out of init on boot
    that spews out some 50 or so "Permission denied" errors on
    various /proc/<pid>/fd/* files, which it never did before that
    I can recall.
    For example, this app complained:
	Cannot stat file /proc/1688/fd/3: Permission denied
	Cannot stat file /proc/1688/fd/4: Permission denied
	Cannot stat file /proc/1688/fd/5: Permission denied
	Cannot stat file /proc/1688/fd/6: Permission denied
	Cannot stat file /proc/1688/fd/7: Permission denied
	Cannot stat file /proc/2781/fd/3: Permission denied
	Cannot stat file /proc/2802/fd/1: Permission denied
	Cannot stat file /proc/2802/fd/3: Permission denied
	Cannot stat file /proc/2802/fd/4: Permission denied
	Cannot stat file /proc/2878/fd/6: Permission denied
	Cannot stat file /proc/2878/fd/7: Permission denied
    You can see it is not complaining about all the fd's of a task,
    but just some.
    I might be confused in what patches I'm running, but I believe that
    I am getting these permission denied errors with just the patches:
    > trivial-cleanup-to-proc_check_chroot.patch
    > proc-fix-the-inode-number-on-proc-pid-fd.patch
-- 
                  I won't rest till it's the best ...
