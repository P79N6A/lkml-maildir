That's one special case.

That's a second special case.

Setuid is a third special case. What happened to good taste? :-)

The namespace bit is a backwards bit, so it can be kept.
This is a wart that must appear everywhere CLONE_* does.
The pre-existing UNIX cruft is something you have to live with.
You didn't make fork() unshare namespaces.
BTW, mount(8) is going to need some serious hackery already,
just because admins will demand global (all namespace) mounting.
Under plan c, an exec should make the world look pretty much as
if the last clone was a fork(). This is great for the CGI example.
Imagine documenting partial unclone. "... except that a CLONE_FILES
relationship is broken when there are close-on-exec file descriptors,
a CLONE_FS relationship is broken if loading the new executable
causes a personality change ... error may be occur iff a task tries
to execute privileged code (setuid, setgid, set-capability-bit, or
unreadable executable) while party to a thread construct involving
CLONE_FS, CLONE_FILES, CLONE_THREAD, CLONE_PTRACE, CLONE_PARENT, or
certain yet-to-be-defined future clone() flags ..."
That doesn't taste good at all. Plan 'a' is OK, plan 'b' is just
barely edible, and plan 'c' is quite tasty.
