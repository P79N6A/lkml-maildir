It has never been done before in Linux, so there must be a reason to it.
There was also a reason why khttpd was (going in and) going out.

Because it is "unportable". You cannot expect to have every hardware Linux 
runs on today to have an FPU engine (hey, like that ol' i386 I got, needs 
CONFIG_MATH_EMU...), especially in the Embedded Devices sector.
