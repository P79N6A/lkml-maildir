Actually, my patch doesn't change the set_mempolicy() API at all, it
just co-opts a currently unused/illegal value for the nodemask to
indicate "all allowed nodes".  Again, I need to provide a libnuma API to
request this.   Soon come, mon...
Here's a link the last posting of my patch, as Paul requested:

A bit out of date, but I'll fix that maybe next week.
