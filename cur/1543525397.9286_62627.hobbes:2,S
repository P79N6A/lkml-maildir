Yep, although some of it may end up being a 2.5 job I expect.
There are basically three things we need to deal with.
* Freeing memory.
  The simple one.  An application wants more memory, so we need to throw
  something out of cache.
* Write throttling.
  There needs to be a way of detecting when we have too many dirty pages
  in memory so that we can stall new write activity while we go about
  flushing some old writes to disk.  Right now we have this for the
  buffer cache but we can't provide similar levels of write throttling
  for filesystems which use the page cache exclusively (ie. without
  using the buffer dirty list).
* Pinned memory thresholds.
  Some filesystems create pages which simply cannot be flushed to disk
  on demand.  For example, a journaled filesystem cannot necessarily
  flush things out until the transaction in progress commits, so we need
  to guarantee that the transaction can get enough new memory to
  commit.  Similarly, filesystems which perform allocate-on-write cannot
  flush their dirty buffers out to disk without first performing other
  disk IOs to complete the allocation.
  There _must_ be a hard, system-wide limit on such pinned pages, so
  that we can guarantee that when we do want to flush pinned pages,
  there is enough unpinned memory available to the page stealer to allow
  the fs transactions to complete and the pinned pages to be released.
  This implies a global count of pinned pages *and* of reservations for
  future pinned pages; and a mechanism for calling back into filesystems
  to start unpinning old pages once the threshold is reached.
