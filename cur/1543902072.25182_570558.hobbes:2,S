So let's look at them:

(nice level : old % : new % : my suggested %)
Your levels divert very quickly from what they used to be (upto a factor 
of 7), it's also not really easy to remember what the individual levels 
mean.
I at least try to keep them somewhat in the range they used to be (and 
the difference is limited to a factor of about 2), also every 5 levels the 
amount of cpu time is halved, which is very easy to remember.
If you need more dynamic range, is there a law that prevents us from going 
beyond 19? For example:
for (i=20;i<=30;i++) print i, " : ", (20-i)*5, " : ", 100*1.25^-i, " : ", e(l(2)*(-i/5))*100, "\n";

setpriority() accepts such values without error.
