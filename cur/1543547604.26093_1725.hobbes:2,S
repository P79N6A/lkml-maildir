	Umm... It still has a hole: pageout during notify_change() can 
allocate new blocks. Window is narrow, but it's there. Fsck knows what 
to do with that. Could we just keep the pointer to current quota elements
(i.e. places where we should charge) in the inode? Then dquot_transfer()
would transfer the charge after notify_change() and switch these pointers
at the same time. Under BKL - nothing can block in that place. How about
such strategy? Then DQUOT_INIT would have set these pointers, but it's not
too horrible, IMO.
