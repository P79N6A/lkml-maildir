The problem with complex permission systems is, well, they are complex...
I'd still go for the UNIX KISS philosophy and the rather easy permission 
system, as it is easier to manage. Windows has all that great permission 
stuff, but if you look at the reality, hardly anybody uses it due to its 
complexity.
