Andi you can make this now:
1) Add new "post-header data pointer" field in SKB.
2) Change drivers to copy into aligned headroom as
   you mention, and they set this new post-header
   pointer as appropriate.  For normal drivers without
   alignment problem, generic code sets the pointer up
   just like it does the rest of the SKB header pointers
   now.
3) Enforce correct usage of it in all the networking :-)
I would definitely accept such a patch for the 2.5.x
series.  It seems to be a nice idea and I currently see
no holes in it.
Later,
