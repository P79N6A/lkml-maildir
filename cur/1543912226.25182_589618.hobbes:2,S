That's strange. 
I've been running cpu offline/online tests with kern bench, 
cpufreq-ondemand and a few rt-tasks running in the background
and it has worked for me. 
Something like 100 iterations without a problem. But these were on
machines with 4-8 cpus.  So may be this could be something specific to
the dual cpu machine.
Can you post the .config? I'll try to recreate it?
It's really strange since you mention that it tooks was  
an echo 1/0 into the sysfs file to break it.

There is a list of maintainers in the Documentation/cpu-hotplug.txt, 
which includes maintainers for different platforms as well.
It's a good idea to add that info to the MAINTAINERS file as well.
Thanks and Regards
