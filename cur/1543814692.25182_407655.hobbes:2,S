But vmtruncate or unmap_mapping_range is quite used to operating on
whatever mm's have mapped the file, so should be a safe route.  Except
here it's a device mapped VM_PFNMAP, so there might prove to be some
gotchas.  I'd be happy to make a nopage fault on VM_PFNMAP give SIGBUS,
for sensible behaviour after the "truncate" - but recent history warns
we're liable then to discover some app expecting otherwise ;)
