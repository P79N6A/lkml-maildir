Hi Andrea, Ingo,
Andrea I tried your patch and it does solve the live-lock
in the LTP waitpid06 test.  The mouse movement gets a bit
jerky but atleast it doesn't lock up.
I guess the next question is how does it do on normal work loads?
I like the idea of making the child processes start with a smaller
sleep_avg value.  Maybe it should just be a constant rather than a
fraction of the parents sleep_avg?  Its really the child processes
inheriting the favorable sleep_avg that caused the problem with
waitpid06.
I liked the idea of giving interactive tasks special treatment. 
Andrea please don't remove this.  Always putting processes
(which have used up there time slice) into the rq->expired array
makes all processes round robin at the same priority.  It makes
sense to do this to fail gracefully if the system is overloaded
but not all the time.
I hope this make sense.  I'm falling asleep writing it:-)
