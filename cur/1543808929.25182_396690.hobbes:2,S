VM_DONTCOPY is hardly used in the kernel, so the semantics aren't very
precisely defined.  But the idea is that a driver setting VM_DONTCOPY
probably has a good reason for doing it, and we don't want userspace
to be able to erase that flag through madvise().
As Hugh said in his suggestion for a better changelog entry:

Perhaps we don't care for now, and we should wait and add
VM_KERNEL_DONTCOPY later if we really need it.  I honestly don't know.
