   I juggled with the patches inside knfsd 1.2.2a, but arent they a little
oldish? I had troubles patching the latest kernels. I use it and kernel
2.2.6 as a server for a Sgi irix and Ibm aix farm, and it kinda does the
work, but then again, i did get a problem as described by Philippe Troin
once. It didnt happen again. By the way, what can we expect to be included
from the knfsd 1.2.2a package in the ac patches?
