Just exactly what I described.
The current system increments the card id on each ->probe, and does not 
decrement on ->remove, which makes sense if you are hotplugging one card 
and then another -- you don't want to reuse the same module options for 
a different card.  Your patch changes this logic to, "oh wait, let's 
stop doing this and have a special case once we reach MAX_UNITS"  Thus, 
you could potentially reuse the final slot when that was not the desired 
action.
Note that I am not defending this method of card_idx usage, because 
different use cases have different requirements (as indeed you do).  But 
your patch fixes one thing at the expense of another.
I just had another idea.  Create a new module option 'default_options', 
a single integer value.  Instead of assigning "-1" to options when we 
run out of MAX_UNITS ids, assign the default_options value.

"same id" is vague.  Same PCI id?  Sure, but that doesn't mean it's the 
same card, from the driver's point of view. The driver really needs to 
keep track of whether or not a new ->probe indicates a card whose MAC 
address we have seen before.
To reiterate another issue, however, suspend/resume should _not_ be 
calling the code added in your patch.  That's a non-3c59x bug somewhere.
