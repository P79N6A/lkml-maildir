It still fails, but I get a different message with the patch:
$ growisofs -Z /dev/dvd=file.iso
Executing 'builtin_dd if=file.iso of=/dev/dvd obs=32k seek=0'
:-( unable to PREVENT MEDIA REMOVAL: Operation not permitted
K3B fails with the same message as above.
As you say, it does indeed burn fine as root.
