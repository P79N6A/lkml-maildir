OK, folks. Code in swapper (unuse_process(), right?) is called only from
sys_swapoff(). It's a syscall. Andrea, could you show a scenario for
deadlock here? OK, some process (but not the process doing swapoff()) may
have the map locked So?  it is not going to release the thing - we are
seriously screwed anyway (read: we already are in deadlock). We don't hold
the semaphore ourselves.
Andrea, post a deadlock scenario, please.
