ACPI methods belong to SATA/PATA targets, not PCI devices. The 
notification you get is something of the form
\SB.PCI.IDE0.SEC.MASTER
on sensible devices, and
\SB.C043.C438.C222.C223
on anything from HP[1]. Somehow, you have to get from there to a 
specific SCSI host and target. By far the easiest way of doing that is 
to register them at device add time, which needs a small amount of 
cooperation from the SCSI or libata layers. And to register the 
notifications in the first place, you need to know the ACPI handles.
[1] Thanks, HP
