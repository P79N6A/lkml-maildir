It has:
"Changes to make to the ECN RFC before it goes to proposed standard: 
     * If the TCP host receives no response to a SYN packet sent
       with the TCP ECN_ECHO and CWR flags set, to indicate
       ECN-capability, then the sender should send its second
       SYN packet without these flags set. This is because
       there are several deployed TCP implementations that
       don't respond to SYN packets with these ECN-related flags set"
