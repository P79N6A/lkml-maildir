unfortunately that only made the lockups on my laptop rarer, it didnt 
totally solve it. My workaround was only done for init acpi methods 
(bootup) - it was getting really ugly when i tried to extend it to all 
ACPI execution. I'd guess the situation on those other systems is 
similar.
Maybe we could take only the 32-bit side of my patch, because that's 
what is most affected by legacies. Although i suspect Windows still 
doesnt inject NMIs in 64-bit mode either, so i dont think there's any 
fundamental difference in terms of breakage in the future, it's just 
that 64-bit systems and 64-bit testing is 1:5 - 1:10 rarer than 32-bit 
testing.
dunno. A distro can still patch the NMI watchdog on, easily. If you 
think it's a better approach i can make this a .config option - just 
like CONFIG_DETECT_SOFTLOCKUP: CONFIG_DETECT_HARDLOCKUP, which would 
default to off?
