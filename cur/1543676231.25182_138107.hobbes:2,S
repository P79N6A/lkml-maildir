I don't know how PnP OS plays into it, but the last time I dug into this
deep dark area, the BIOS was expected to setup the cache line size for
all PCI devices in the system.
I do specifically remember situations, involving Acenic cards, where
one Acenic card would have things setup correctly but for whatever
reason the BIOS decided not to init the other Acenic cards.
