Subject: [PATCH] (14/43) Kconfig fix (airo_cs on m32r)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/23/202

airo_cs is broken on m32r; marked as such. [Proper fix would involve
separating PCI-dependent parts and making sure they don't get in the
way _and_ arranging for asm/scatterlist.h getting picked on m32r]
