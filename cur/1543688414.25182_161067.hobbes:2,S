I'm glad you enjoyed it. No CFQ hasn't been dropped, it was/is just on
hold waiting for the loadable scheduler infrastructure. The reason for
that is that I made lots of changes to that code base, not the old one
that was in -mm.
It shouldn't be too hard to adapt the latest version from before -mm
dropped it and adapting to the current kernels. If you want to give that
a go, I'd be happy to help you out.
