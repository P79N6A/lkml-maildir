Likewise in an HA environment, if you've got a standby node 
available, we prefer to fail over on an oom condition or (or an oops, 
for that matter) than to try to continue running in some randomly 
crippled way. The node in question can then reboot and return to 
service as a standby.
Ideally, we'd have a notifier that would be triggered for every 
unanticipated process kill (oom, oops, whatever).
