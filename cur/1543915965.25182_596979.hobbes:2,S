I was referring to the resume part.  If we call enable_nonboot_cpus(), which
executes the _INI ACPI control method, after platform_finish(), which executes
the _WAK global ACPI control method, things will break.  That already happened
in the past, when the code ordering was different, AFAICS.

Yes, it looks so.

Exactly.  timekeeping_suspend() is called from device_power_down(), which is
called from swsusp_suspend() (after disabling interrupts).

Well, perhaps there's something else that we should suspend late and resume
early, but we don't?
