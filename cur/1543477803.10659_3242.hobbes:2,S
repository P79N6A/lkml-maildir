What Heinz is asking for has nothing to do with stability. I think it's
trivial to do what he needs without having to reinsert the buffer_max
limit. I think that arca-vm-20 only need an:
echo 5 2 4 32 128 512 >/proc/sys/vm/pager
or a:
echo 3 2 4 32 128 512 >/proc/sys/vm/pager
to work well for Heinz. Heinz could you confirm that? If understand well
your problem is a too much heavy swapout even if there's a lot of
freeable buffer memory?

Sure it's possible but I think it would raise a big mess. I think it's
very better to have only one algorithm and have it very well tested from
everybody.
