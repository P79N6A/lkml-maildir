If you do statement like this, please, provide reasons why you say it
for these patches and suggest something _constructive_. I do not see any
point in this vague phrase.
And please, note, I was directed here by David Woodhouse who is MTD
maintainer because he thinks the patch is large and needs more people to
look at it, not just him.
