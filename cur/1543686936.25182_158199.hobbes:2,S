Thanks Neil.  That was very informative. :)

Any idea of the ETA for that nice interim patch?
And if there is already a merge_bvec_function defined and coded, why is it
not being used?!  Isn't that supposed to be detected by the BIO sybsystem,
and used automatically when it's defined?  Or were there some bugs found in
it and it was disabled temporarily?  Maybe not everyone agrees on bio
spliting/merging?  (I seem to recall a thread about that a while back, but I
thougth it was resolved...)
