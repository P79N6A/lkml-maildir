Hi!
Is anyone currently working on a ikp-HOWTO? If not, having mastered the
installation, I would write a mini-HOWTO in the next couple of months.
Any suggestions on where to get additional information (other than the
developers directly, I will drop them a message myself)?
Any questions & comments welcome....
Marc
