Yes. On the other hand, if there are real problems with converting
menu/x config to multiple help-files, a short-term answer might indeed
be just the silly "concatenate everything into the same file".
I'd much _prefer_ to have somebody who knows menuconfug/xconfig (or just
wants to learn).  I have a totally untested patch for menuconfig, that
probably just works (like the regular config thing it doesn't actualy
take _advantage_ of pairing the Config.help files up with the questions,
but at least it should give you the help texts like it used to). 
I don't know tcl/tk _at_all_, so I haven't even looked at what the
required syntax is for header.tk to use the same kind of "find .  -name
Config.help" thing.
