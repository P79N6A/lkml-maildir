Actually, the answer is aparently "No."  LVM2's tools don't work with a
2.4.x kernel.  However, I since I was smart enough to stuff a backup copy
of the utilities into /root/lvm10.tar, 2.5.47 with the devicemapper patch
(so that it compiles properly) booted up just fine, first try.  Of course,
I needed to remember to load the "mousedev" module before X would work,
but that's not a kernel issue.
I'm fairly impressed with 2.5.x so far (once it compiled properly!).
