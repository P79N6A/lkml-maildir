This is buggy for a number of reasons. Firstly, how do you make sure
that someone else doesn't race with your hwif_data manipulation? This
looks very suspect. By far the worst problem is that you are assuming
that ide_do_reset() can sleep, when in fact it cannot (just follow the
various paths into ide_do_request()). You even grab the ide_lock _and_
disable interrupts yourself prior calling wait_for_completion(), this is
incredibly broken.
