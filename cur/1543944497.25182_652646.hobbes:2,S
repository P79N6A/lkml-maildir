	Make the distinction earlier.  With ocfs2 and configfs (we got
this scheme from Jeff), we keep the topic branches as "unsafe" - that
is, officially rebaseable .  We merge them all into a big "ALL" branch,
which is also "unsafe".  Andrew pulls this for -mm, and it gets tested 
here.  If there is a brown-paper-bag problem, we can tell the original
author to fix it.  Then we re-pull the topic - effectively a rebase.
The ALL is also rebased.  But that's Ok, it will never go towards Linus.
	When a topic is considered worthy of going upstream, we pull it
to a branch called "upstream-linus".  This branch is *NEVER* rebased.
Now that the topic is in upstream-linus, the original topic branch can't
be rebased either.  So any fixes to that topic going forward will stay
in the history.  Since that topic was pulled into ALL for testing, we
are using the identical commits that got tested.
