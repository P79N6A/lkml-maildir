	I'm using egcs-1.1.2, binutils-2.9.1.0.25, glibc-2.1.1 and SMP,
I'm compiling with -O3 but I have the same problem with -O2. I haven't got
time to test the patch posted to the list, but will try it before tonight 
(GMT+1) and post the results.
	And just for talk about it, now we have 2.3.x, what about 
Richard's devfs?, I've using it for more than six months and it works
wonderfull, I know not everybody need it and not everybody want to use 
it, but it is an option... so you can choose.

PS: The question about devfs is just to not let it be forgotten, not for 
starting any kind of thread on it.
