Hi,
2.3.10 doesn't boot on Samsung UX (Ruffian). 
The sym53c8xx driver fails with a message that the cache is
incorrectly configured. (ncr53c8xx does the same).
I have had the exact same problem with 2.2.x-ac patches. And I
believe the problem is to do with some memory management changes. (or
so i was told).
It'd be great if those changes could be made to work on Ruffian
aswell.
regards,
