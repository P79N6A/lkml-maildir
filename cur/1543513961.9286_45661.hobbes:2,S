I have a socket connected on a port
  that is working just fine. However
  I saw an error status come back from
  a write() system call of 27 which
  is EFBIG. What does that mean to me?
  I know it means file to big but I should 
  not be writing anything bigger than 1500
  bytes on socket at a time.
  Also, If memory is getting low does
  the kernel send a SIGTERM to elected
  processes? Does the kernel ever send
  a SIGTERM to processes without a
  shutdown or requested by the user?
  My program has caught a SIGTERM being
  sent to it. It was not by me and I was not shutting down? Curious?
  I have also seen after looking at "ps ax" 
  that it is reporting a STATUS of DWN.
  where D is uninterruptable sleep. How
  can I get rid of this process? And what
  caused it to be uniterruptable? I'm
  not doing anything weird in my program.
 
Thanks,
PLease CC me directly.
  I use 2.0.38, slackware 3.5.
