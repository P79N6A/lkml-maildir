Subject: [TRIVIAL PATCH] PCI debug compile fix in sis_router_probe()

Hello!
I get a compile error when I define "DEBUG" in arch/i386/pci/pci.h.
Variable rt is not defined in sis_router_probe(), file
arch/i386/pci/irq.c.
Let's see if that debug statement is useful at all.  sis_router_probe() is
used in pirq_routers table.  Other functions used there, such as
via_router_probe(), don't print anything.
pirq_routers is only used in pirq_find_router(), which prints the actually
found router, including its name (such as "SIS"), vendor, device and PCI
name.  There is nothing sis_router_probe() could add to that.
The attached patch removes the unnecessary and wrong debug print in
sis_router_probe().  The patch is against Linux 2.6.6.
