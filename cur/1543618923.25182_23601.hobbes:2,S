I lied.  Linus applied it, but not, it seems, Marcelo.
So.  Here's a patch.
It marks all framebuffer mappings as VM_IO.  This prevents
kernel deadlocks which can occur when a program which
has a framebuffer mapping attempts to dump core.
It also allows get_user_pages() to detect and skip these
IO mappings, so ptrace, O_DIRECT, etc will not permit
I/O against these mappings.
I've Cc'ed linux-fbdev-devel.  Could someone please
review?
