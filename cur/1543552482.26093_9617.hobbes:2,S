Works for me. And yes, the list of ->nopage instances that can return
success is that short:
	drm_vm_shm_nopage
	drm_vm_shm_nopage_lock
	drm_vm_dma_nopage
	sgi_graphics_nopage
	via_mm_nopage
	ncp_file_mmap_nopage
	shm_nopage
	shmzero_nopage
	filemap_nopage
- sorry, it's not 9+filemap_nopage, it's 8+filemap_nopage.
However, it still leaves a window for the race: we invalidate first and
remove from pagetables later. And ClearPageUptodate() is obviously
truncate_inode_pages() work. Grr...
