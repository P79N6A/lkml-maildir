In C++ NULL can _not_ be defined that way: The standard explicitly states
that NULL is an integral expression that evaluates to zero. 
You are probably using another header file that includes this broken
definition, or a broken C++ compiler. Note that the C++ support in
gcc-2.7.2.3 is very bad, check out egcs <
http://egcs.cygnus.com

As you see, it is complaining about the use of "(void *) 0" here, and would
most probably complain for _each_ use of NULL...
