Many thanks to Eric and you for your help in tracking the problem down!
@Andi,Andrew:
It seems use-funit-at-a-time breaks with distributions shipping a gcc
3.3 that supports -funit-at-a-time.
Th patch below replaces use-funit-at-a-time.patch and uses 
scripts/gcc-version.sh from add-config-for-mregparm-3-ng* to use 
-funit-at-a-time only with gcc >= 3.4 .
