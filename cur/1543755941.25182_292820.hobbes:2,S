I've been telling SysKonnect for _years_ that they need to split up 
their patches, but they still keep sending ever-larger jumbo driver 
update patches.
Stephen Hemminger split up their patch into a bunch of patches, and I 
applied several of those.
Apparently, Stephen also got sick of trying to patch and clean sk98lin, 
so he went and wrote his own "skge" driver.  It's available in my 
netdev-2.6 queue, and should be in the latest -mm.
