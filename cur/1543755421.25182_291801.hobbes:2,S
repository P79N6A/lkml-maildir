This would need to be dynamic in size, as a device could be blocked for 
a long time. In the scenario that this is used for power management and 
the device could be blocked for a long time, its unclear that we would 
still want all the writes accumulated to be written out when the device 
becomes unblocked.

This would be nice and simple. I know Alan had some issue with returning 
failures on reads when blocked.
Alan - do you have the same issue on writes?

Would also be pretty simple to do and seems a little safer than 
potentially assaulting the recently unblocked device with who knows what 
values. The only problem I see with this is that we could end up 
returning strange values on cached reads if the writes update the cache. 
If userspace wrote to a read only register, we would end up returning 
that value on the read, which may not be the right thing to do.

We could go back to Alan's idea of putting userspace reads/writes to 
sleep when the device is blocked, although this has additional 
complications as well...

The purpose of this API is to provide a way for the kernel to stop 
userspace from accessing PCI devices when the results of doing so would 
be catastrophic, such as a PCI bus error. The only users of this API so 
far are device drivers running BIST on an adapter (which shouldn't 
happen on a video card AFAIK) and for PPC power management (Ben - will 
this be an issue for you?)
