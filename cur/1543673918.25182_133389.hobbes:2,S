okay.. I found out after compiling and running bk4-bk8 again that the 
problem is actually in the TI Graphlink driver. The USB trackball 
doesn't give me the messages. Next time, I'll check each USB device one 
at a time and not waste anyone's time. :-/
I was just seeing the overlap in the messages.
Thanks,
