	Exactly. Pre-emption based on dynamic priorities is an "if it helps"
feature and not one required by the semantics. On the other hand,
pre-emption based on static priorities is pretty much required and not doing
that would certainly violate the principle of least astonishment.

	You say "the dyn prio doesn't change the timeslice size", but that's not
true. If a process with low dynamic priority writes to a FIFO, its timeslice
will be cut short, whereas one with a higher dynamic priorit would enjoy a
longer timeslice. Yes, priority doesn't affect the *intended* timeslice, but
it can affect the effective timeslice.

	As it certainly should. The maximum amount of time we could justify
delaying a task with a higher static priority in the name of better 'bulk
data' performance is so small that it's probably not feasible to do it at
all.

	No. I don't think that's appropriate. Higher statis priority is an explicit
decision made by users for the specific reason of getting the faster
response. Under no circumstances should an NTP process that received a UDP
packet be prevented from getting that packet as quickly as possible.

	With static priorities, you can always tell people "Don't do that then, you
got what you asked for. The system doesn't know what you 'really want'."
With dynamic priorities, however, this is not the case.
	I'm not sure what the best solution is. But I think it's along the lines of
deferring a deschedule based purely on dynamic priorities if the task has
used only a small fraction of its timeslice. Perhaps, for example, a normal
timeslice should be four jiffies. If a reschule would normally occur during
the first jiffy, and it's based purely on dynamic priorities, we set a flag
which we check when the first jiffy ends.
	Now maybe in some cases where the static priorities only differ slightly,
we should defer even based on static priorities. Perhaps immediate
pre-emption during the beginning of a timeslice should only occur when the
winning process has an elevated priority (and not just because the losing
process has a reduced one).
	I don't really know. But I think what we're doing now is fundamentally
wrong because processes should be allowed to use up their timeslices when
possible.
