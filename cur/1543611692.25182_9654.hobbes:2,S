I'd certainly call 'i' well understood in both math and computing. In  
math, 'i' is what engineers call 'j' (i*i == -1), and in computing, 'i'  
('j', 'k', ...) is a counter for loops (some variant of int) that don't  
exceed about a screenful.

Of course, if you use them differently from what the convention is, *then*  
you are in trouble.

Yup.
