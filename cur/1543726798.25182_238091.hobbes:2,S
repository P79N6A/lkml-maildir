Hi,
assuming cpu 0 is the boot cpu sounds fragile/incorrect, but for irqbalanced
I'd like to find out which cpu is the boot cpu, is there a good way of doing
so ?
The reason for needing this is that some firmware only likes running on the
boot cpu so I need to bind firmware-related irq's to that cpu ideally.
Greetings,
