Hi, Serge.
I packaged the xattr extension of libcap, get/setfcaps command and
manual pages with original libcap-1.10-25.
See, 
http://www.kaigai.gr.jp/index.php?FrontPage#b556e50d
You can download RPM and SRPM package for the latest FC6 system.
There are no difference at its functionality, but the part of xattr
extension is moved into /lib/libcap.so.1.
Thanks,
