Subject: 2.2.19: eepro100 and cmd_wait issues

I'm having trouble on one machine out of about 20 that run with eepro100's. 
This one in particular happens to be a dual port.  I searched through the
archives for this, but I didn't find any definite solutions (one thread, on
"2.2.18 and laptop problems," provided a patch that doesn't seem to make any
difference).
After roughly 30 days of uptime, I get a lot of kernel messages like the
following:
kernel: eepro100: cmd_wait for(0x70) timedout with(0x70)!
kernel: eepro100: cmd_wait for(0x10) timedout with(0x10)!
I'd like to assume that this is bad hardware, but since the problem only
happens every 30 days or so (and every 30 days or so), I wanted to check here to
make sure it wasn't a driver issue.
The only solution I've found that works is to reboot, and since this is
probably the most production machine I'm responsible for (couldn't be any other
one, right?), I'd like to make sure I don't have to schedule a reboot every 29
days or something. :)
