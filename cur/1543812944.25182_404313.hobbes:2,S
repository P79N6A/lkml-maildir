Actually recent distros like the upcoming Ubuntu Dapper support the new
RLIMIT_NICE and RLIMIT_RTPRIO so this would Just Work without any
special privileges (well, not root anyway - you'd have to put the user
in the right group and add one line to /etc/security/limits.conf).
I think OSX also uses special scheduling classes for stuff with RT
constraints.
The only barrier I see is that games aren't specifically written to take
advantage of RT scheduling because historically it's only been available
to root.
