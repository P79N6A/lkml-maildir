OK thanks fro Doug Ledford and Oliver Xymoron,  I was able to finally build
a small test KNI app and confirm that it did indeed run on my P-III only
when the necessary PIII/KNI patch was installed.
This leads to me to two more questions:
1) Anybody know how to get gdb to dump KNI registers?  The documentation
from Intel says that the KNI registers are independent of the normal FP
registers, it looks like gdb would need some extra code
to grab the state of KNI and dump it
2) Does anybody know if I can use the "Four 32-bit single-precision (SP),
floating-point numbers" described in the Intel manuals as two 64-bit double
precision floating point numbers, and peform the KNI operations
on those instead?
Since this is getting OT, please just reply to me directly.
Thanks.
 David Konerding
