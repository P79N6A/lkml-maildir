abort doesn't work well either, and ide-scsi needs to be ported to do
proper new error handling. It's internal buffering stinks. In short, it
really needs to be almost rewritten if it is serve some useful purpose.
If it wasn't for the principle of it, it really should not be a big job.

It's incredible how anything like that ever got merged, looks like it
was introduced with scsi_sleep() change.

Broken, will introduced infinite stalls.
