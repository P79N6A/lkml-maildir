A bit more of background:
The US Department of Homeland Security pays them some money for scanning 
open source projects, the Linux kernel is one of these projects, and 
kernel developers can therefore get access to the database with the
results from their regular scans of Linus' tree.
I'm not a fan of proprietary software, but I'm simply considering their 
results as bug reports that are worth looking at.
