Having one page inside frag_list writable does not make a lot of sence,
so we really need either all of them writable, or nothing.
And it is much less error-prone to assume that every page is read-only.

Yes, that would be good, but who will give us a bit in the struct page?
Can we recreate frag_list elements to be a bitmasks and steal couple
of them there, so we would not increase fragment's structure size?
