Yup... very strange. Not proper delegation to zoneedit.com?

My point was that changing it in the Makefile does not work.
kpc ~ # grep CC= /usr/src/linux/Makefile
CC=distcc
# echo $CC
kpc ~ # uname -a
Linux kpc 2.6.14.4-K01_P4_desktop #1 Sun Dec 18 22:46:08 JST 2005 i686 Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU
2.40GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux
What I want is making a bunch of kernels in NFS exported /var/kernels/out/`uname -r` and then be
able to `make modules` on other machines without having to recompile the whole thing. All (or
almost?) boxes use gcc-3.4.4 and distcc to share the load.
Kalin.
