st_mode=S_IFREG|S_ISGID|0640 implies a "mandatory locking" file. 
knfsd currently refuses to touch mandatory locking files as NFS (v2
and v3 at least) cannot support mandatory locking.  It would probably
be as safe, and less intrusive, to allow access but simply deny all
lock requests to a mandatory locking file, but I haven't looked into
the issues very deeply.
Do you know which file is being accessed?  used "tcpdump -s 300"
should help you find out.
Does it "need" to have mandatory locking set?
