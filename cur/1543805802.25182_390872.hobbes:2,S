There are several issues here :
alloc_percpu() current implementation is a a waste of ram. (because it uses 
slab allocations that have a minimum size of 32 bytes)
Currently we cannot use per_cpu(&some_object, cpu), so a generic version of 
vm_acct_memory() would need a rework of percpu.h and maybe this is not 
possible on every platform ?
#define per_cpu(var, cpu) (*RELOC_HIDE(&per_cpu__##var, __per_cpu_offset[cpu]))
-->
#define per_cpu_name(var) per_cpu__##var
#define per_cpu_addr(var) &per_cpu_name(var)
#define per_cpu(var, cpu) (*RELOC_HIDE(per_cpu_addr(var), __per_cpu_offset[cpu])
But this could render TLS migration difficult...
