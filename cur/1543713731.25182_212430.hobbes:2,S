It's not quite a cut and dried decision.
Define a 'small' system to be one where NR_CPUS <= BITS_PER_LONG, and a
'large' system to be those that aren't small.
If one had a bitmap operator called in a performance critical path on a
'small' system with a non-constant (unknown to the optimizer) bitmap
size, then one would _not_ want the above check for builtin_constant.
Leaving out the buildin_constant check results in code that checks the
variable size at runtime, performs the fast inline instructions on a
single word if it fits, else jumps to an out-of-line block of code that
calls the real __bitmap_op() function.
Since on a 'small' system, the bitmap size probably fits in a word, and
since on a performance critical path, it's worth checking for the fast
inline instruction opportunity, avoiding a jump out of line and avoiding
a real function call, the code obtained by leaving out the check for
builtin_constant is ideal.
However ... it costs you a half dozen machine instructions of text
space, for the out-of-line code block to handle the slow case that calls
the real __bitmap_op() function.
Since almost all systems are small, and since almost all bitmap operations
are not on critical paths, and since almost all bitmap operations are
called with a constant bitmap size, these half dozen machine instructions
are almost never worth a slug of warm spit.
Better to do just as Rusty suggests - if called with a non-constant
size, just say screw it and call the __bitmap_op() routine.  While that
call might not have been necessary (might even be an 'issue' in a
performance critical path), it's not worth the half-dozen machine
instructions to find out.
So I guess the real question is:
	Is it worth the slug of warm source code spit, the
	extra __builtin_constant_p(nbits) condition, to get rid
	of these six instructions for each bitmap_op() call
	made with a non-constant bitmap size?
Or the real real question - is this discussion worth a slug of warm
lkml posts ... ;)?
				===
Aha - I just built an 8 CPU SMP i386 config with my latest stuff.
Exactly one call appears to any __bitmap_* function, in the routine
bitmap_parse() of lib/bitmap.c:
	bitmap_shift_right(maskp, maskp, CHUNKSZ, nmaskbits);
Ok - change this to the following, and save six text instructions
testing for the possibility that nmaskbits < BITS_PER_LONG:
	__bitmap_shift_right(maskp, maskp, CHUNKSZ, nmaskbits);
There .. now the inline bitmap_* operators are _always_ seeing
constant bitmap sizes (for this exhaustive sampling of size one ;).
Conclusions:
     1) To heck with the extra __builtin_constant_p(nbits) condition.
	It's not worth polluting the source code with stuff to futz
	with a six instruction space/time tradeoff in some situation
	that doesn't yet exist, and if it did exist, might or might
	not want such a tradeoff.
     2) No - this post wasn't worth a slug of warm spit ;).
