sure, that would work more or less, but what would it give you?
You haven't introduced anything new that userspace couldn't do before.
Just write a library which mangles pathnames and treats files and
directories the same. You don't need the kernel to do that.
Filesystems are there to store files.
Everything else can be done in userspace.
