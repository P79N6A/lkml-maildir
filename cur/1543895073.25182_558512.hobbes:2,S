Sorry, poor choice of words. I meant that they can violate the GPL, because 
they have the right to say "You can't modify the software on the device you 
are renting". I mis-stated it because I didn't make it clear that, even 
though that is their legal right, they would still be in violation of the 
GPL.
The reason that it is different from the TiVO case is that they have not 
stopped you from doing any modification - what they have prevented is the use 
of those modifications on the hardware they designed. The response from the 
FSF and people like you (Alexandre) is childish - at best. "They have one of 
our toys in their house but we can't play with it. WAAAAH!"
