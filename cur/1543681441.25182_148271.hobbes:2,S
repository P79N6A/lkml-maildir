Subject: [PATCH 0/17] Sync Linuxtv.org CVS with 2.6-test kernels
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi all,
here comes a series of 17 patches that sync the Linuxtv.org DVB driver 
CVS with the 2.6-test series.
The mail subject contains a short description, longer descriptions are 
inlined at the beginning of each file.
The first 9 patches have been sent before, but have not been applied 
yet. So patches 10 to 17 are incremental patches, which might change 
files again.
Some highlights:
- saa7146 capture core has been updated
- dvb-core has been updated, especially the dvb-net functionality
- add new DVB-T frontend drivers for MT312 and TDA14005
- add a driver for the DVB-S Skystar2 card by Technisat
- add drivers for two Hauppauge USB DVB-T adapters
- add drivers for the Hexium Orion and Gemini frame grabber cards
Thanks for reading!
CU
Michael.
