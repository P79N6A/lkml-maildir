   You're the one with the 20 Apache processes of 40 MB each, right? Just
imagine what happens when glibc starts touching all malloc()ed memory.
You'll lose the swap savings you like overcommitment for. In addition,
you'll lose some system performance when all those 800 MB have to be
touched. Requiring programs to touch the memory they have allocated will
only make things worse in every possible way. That in addition to violating
standards and thus breaking backward compatibility.
