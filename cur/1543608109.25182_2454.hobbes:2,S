The expensive code in the timer interupt will be executed every
497.1 days, so that's bearable.

should be
	return lo + (((u64)hi) << BITS_PER_LONG);
to not break 64 bit platforms.
Admittedly, I broke 64 bit myself by submitting a wrong version of my
patch. The condition
	if (jiffies != 0xffffffffUL) {
		jiffies++;
in do_timer needs to be
	if (jiffies != (unsigned long)-1) {
		jiffies++;

I believe not, but it is platform-specific.
