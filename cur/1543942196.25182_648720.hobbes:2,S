This seems to cause very irritating and bogus messages for me:
	Probing IDE interface ide0...
	Probing IDE interface ide1...
	ide2: I/O resource 0x0-0x7 not free.
	ide2: ports already in use, skipping probe
	ide3: I/O resource 0x0-0x7 not free.
	ide3: ports already in use, skipping probe
	ide4: I/O resource 0x0-0x7 not free.
	ide4: ports already in use, skipping probe
	ide5: I/O resource 0x0-0x7 not free.
	ide5: ports already in use, skipping probe
	ide6: I/O resource 0x0-0x7 not free.
	ide6: ports already in use, skipping probe
	ide7: I/O resource 0x0-0x7 not free.
	ide7: ports already in use, skipping probe
	ide8: I/O resource 0x0-0x7 not free.
	ide8: ports already in use, skipping probe
	ide9: I/O resource 0x0-0x7 not free.
	ide9: ports already in use, skipping probe
and that's just totally bogus. It shouldn't even request that region, 
since it's not been allocated!
So that "ide_device_add_all()" is missing some checks. Should it check the 
probe[] array like ideprobe_init() used to, or what?
