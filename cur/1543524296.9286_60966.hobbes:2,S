You're right--I goofed.  Allow me to repent by giving the *real* answer (now
that my credibility is shot :-).
When you use 'strace -f' to follow these two processes, strace attaches itself
(with ptrace) to the child, which changes its parent (for the purposes of
wait) to be the strace process itself.  Thus the wait call returns ECHILD,
since the child in question has been "kidnapped" by strace.
There are difficulties with trying to implement the correct wait4 behavior
under ptrace.  strace goes to some effort to do the right thing, but this case
isn't covered.
More to follow,
