The read and write operations are DEFINITELY related to the file descriptor
because of f_pos.  Each process opening the same file can have a different
f_pos so read/write will work in different locations of the file.
In contrast getattr and getxattr operate on the single inode and you don't
get e.g. a different i_size or i_uid or i_gid depending on who opened a
file, nor is the xattr different.
Cheers, Andreas
