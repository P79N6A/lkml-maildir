Which looks just like the pci_for_each_dev we used to have.
That function got removed due some shortcoming or other that I never
fully understood, but ISTR it had something to do with locking.
(why it couldnt be hidden inside for_each_pci_dev is a mystery to me)
We've had lots of code in the kernel go from this..
pci_for_each_dev(loop_dev) {
to the disgustingly unreadable..
while ((loop_dev = pci_find_device(PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, loop_dev)) != NULL) {
and now its going to ..
for_each_pci_dev(loop_dev) {
So,.. what has all this churn bought us, and where does it end ?
With four words in the function name, we've enough possibilities
for quite a few more iterations yet.
