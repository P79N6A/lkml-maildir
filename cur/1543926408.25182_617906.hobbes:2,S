I'm afraid we are, which probably explains it.
We have a bunch of 64 bit machines, but this particular machine
is one of our somewhat more ancient IBM x235 machines.  It's
got stacks of fast SCSI drives and a couple of hyperthreading
Xeons in it.  Very nice machine in its day, and very reliable
which is why we have kept them, even though at 6RU it chews
through disk space.
Unfortunately none of the 64 bit machines are world facing,
and we're running HIGHMEM64G on a bunch of machines both for
consistency value and because we only have one machine left
with only 2Gb.
I guess we'll be doing the one-liner kernel mod and testing
that then.  I'd certainly like to build a test case anyway
so I'm not spending too much time rebooting that machine,
it's also our outbound SMTP gateway.
And I'll keep in mind finding a 64 bit capable machine for
the role when I can.
Thanks for the feedback on this - I'll come back with more
details once we've done some testing, but this sounds likely,
and I don't think DCC is going to change how it works, so
we're stuck supporting it.
