The spec just mentions that iBFT table has to be "compatible with an ACPI 
table format" and nothing else. In reality I've only tested this on x86_64 
and i386. We can limit it to be X86 || IA64 but I wouldn't make it dependent 
on ACPI - as this data does not necessarily have to be exported via ACPI.
