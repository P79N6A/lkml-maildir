Hi
Please help.
I was testing 2.6.16-rc4 and seem to have lost my data filesystem :(
I know it's called scratch - but my wife went and stored data on there -
grrr!
Anyway, I'm now in trouble.
I am running XFS over LVM over a 3-disk RAID5.
Something (libata?) caused some bogus read errors (see kernel-ide for
details) which threw 2 drives out of my raid array:
sd 0:0:0:0: SCSI error: return code = 0x8000002
sda: Current: sense key: Medium Error
    Additional sense: Unrecovered read error - auto reallocate failed
end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 390716735
raid5: Disk failure on sda1, disabling device. Operation continuing on 2
devices
ata2: no sense translation for op=0x2a cmd=0x3d status: 0x51
ata2: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
sd 1:0:0:0: SCSI error: return code = 0x8000002
sdb: Current: sense key: Medium Error
    Additional sense: Unrecovered read error - auto reallocate failed
end_request: I/O error, dev sdb, sector 390716735
raid5: Disk failure on sdb1, disabling device. Operation continuing on 1
devices
RAID5 conf printout:
 --- rd:3 wd:1 fd:2
 disk 0, o:1, dev:sdd1
 disk 1, o:0, dev:sdb1
 disk 2, o:0, dev:sda1
xfs_force_shutdown(dm-0,0x1) called from line 338 of file
fs/xfs/xfs_rw.c.  Return address = 0xc020c0e9
Filesystem "dm-0": I/O Error Detected.  Shutting down filesystem: dm-0
Please umount the filesystem, and rectify the problem(s)
I/O error in filesystem ("dm-0") meta-data dev dm-0 block
0x640884a       ("xlog_bwrite") error 5 buf count 262144
XFS: failed to locate log tail
XFS: log mount/recovery failed: error 5
XFS: log mount failed
After checking with mdadm --examine I was able to reconstruct the array
using the 2 booted devices as they both had the same event count:
raid5: device sdb1 operational as raid disk 1
raid5: device sda1 operational as raid disk 2
raid5: allocated 3155kB for md1
raid5: raid level 5 set md1 active with 2 out of 3 devices, algorithm 2
RAID5 conf printout:
 --- rd:3 wd:2 fd:1
 disk 1, o:1, dev:sdb1
 disk 2, o:1, dev:sda1
I restarted lvm and remounted the drive but it failed like this:

I then then rebooted into 2.6.15 (where it's been happy for weeks and
weeks!)
