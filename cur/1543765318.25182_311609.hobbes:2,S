False.
For example, you can indicate acceptance of the GPL by exercising the
rights it grants.
Furthermore, the converse is also false: it's quite possible to install
software on your machine without clicking on the click-through license.
For example, someone else might install it for you.  [You expect my dad
to figure out how to install anything?]
