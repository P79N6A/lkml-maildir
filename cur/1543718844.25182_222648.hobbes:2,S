If the "accessed" or "dirty" bits are zero, accessing/writing the
page will cause a fault which will be handled in a low-level
fault handler.  The Linux version of these handlers simply turn
on the respective bit.  See daccess_bit(), iaccess_bit(), and dirty_bit()
in arch/ia64/kernel/ivt.S.
Note: I'm on travel and haven't seen the context of this discussion
and don't expect to have time to think about this until I return on
Thursday.  So if you don't hear from me, it's not because I'm ignoring
you... ;-)
