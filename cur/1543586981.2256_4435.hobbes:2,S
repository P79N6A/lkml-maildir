You return one value in both casesand I decided it means "schedule". 8)
Apparently you meaned return 1 in the first case. 8)
But in this case it becomes wrong. do_softirq() can raise need_reshed
and moreover irqs arrive during it. Order of check should be different.
BTW what's about overhead... I suspect it is _lower_ in the case
of schedule(). In the case of networking at least, when softirq
most likely wakes some socket.
