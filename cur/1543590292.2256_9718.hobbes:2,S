Moreover, the filesystem may want to return "-1" even if "priority" is
non-zero --- think about delayed allocations. (the XFS guys were just
complaining about page_launder() not checking the return value of
writepage() so they could not do this kind of thing with delayed
allocations sometime ago).

I like it --- it pushes down control to the pagers so they can be smarter.
Will send a patch later.
