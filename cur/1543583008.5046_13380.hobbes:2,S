Right now before OOPS:
Mem:    62244K av,   61292K used,     952K free,       0K shrd,    1496K buff
Swap:  467444K av,   37344K used,  430100K free                   29528K cached
I got a lot of things running, several daemons, netscape, and other things. I put
a 400MB swap for now just to help things.
Here's what happens after oops:
Wait a second...before I didn't have the 400MB swap on, and I had about 952K of
physical ram left. Shouldn't it try and swap if it cant get enough physical
memory?
It did NOT oops with that amount of swap:
If i turn it off:
Mem:    62244K av,   61288K used,     956K free,       0K shrd,    1448K buff
Swap:   64252K av,   38024K used,   26228K free                   29880K cached
and try the xcdrgtk (X CDRoaster)
I get...hrm.. this is really strange. Now its not ooping?!
I dont know it must have to do with something somewhere I cant tell you.
