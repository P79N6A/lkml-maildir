Subject: [patch] fix .text.exit error in mtd/maps/pci.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following error occured at the final linking of 2.4.19-rc1:
<--  snip  -->
...
drivers/mtd/mtdlink.o(.data+0x934): undefined reference to `local
symbols in discarded section .text.exit'
...
<--  snip  -->
The following patch fixes it (mtd_pci_remove is __devexit but the pointer
to it didn't use __devexit_p):

You only think this is a free country. Like the US the UK spends a lot of
time explaining its a free country because its a police state.
