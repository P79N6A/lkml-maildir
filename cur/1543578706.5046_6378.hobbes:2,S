Hi all,
            I am trying to install linux on IBM PS/2 server 95 MCA machine
with Pentium 90 .  But it is not bootingSince it is not booting fro the CD
I am booting the kernel from floppy disk with boot.img. The halts after the
message "POSIX conformance testing by UNIFIX".  The kernel parameters that
I gave are  :  mca-pentium   no-hlt  nosmp . Have anyone installed Linux in
a machine with this configuration. How should I proceed....HELP!!
