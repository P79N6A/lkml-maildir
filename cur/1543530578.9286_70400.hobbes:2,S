The daemon could not have a fixed amount of memory. Each time it attempts to
record more data, it will have to expand. New processes will have to have
more entries for data...

OOM can be avoided in most cases. Using resource accounting to determine
where, and how much to allocate allows the finite resources to be managed.
When the OOR (Out-Of-Reserve) occurs, the accounting records can be used
to determine where to reduce quota, and where to expand it. When this is
no longer possible, it provides the justification to expand the resources.
One of the systems my site had was oversubscribed by a 3:1 ratio. When the
system did finaly hang, we could determine that too much resource was
allocated for interactive use (it wasn't being used). It was reallocated
to the batch system, and the problem didn't occur again for a long while.
At no time did the system kill "random" processes. It was always known
exactly who to kill. It was always known what that process was trying to
do. The accounting gave us a way to track it, and to reallocate it.
When it started occuring with some frequency (once a month was considered
"frequent") we could justify expanding the swap space. The oversubscription
reduced to 2.5:1 and again the problem reduced. This is on a system with
16GB of memory and the swap space ended up around 40GB. (if I remember the
system correctly - it was 3 years ago..)
