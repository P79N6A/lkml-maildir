Subject: 2.2.13 ate my cdrom

With 2.2.12:
* Philips ATAPI CDR probes and identifies correctly. Apparently works
well.
* (Unknown) 24x ATAPI CDROM fails the probe phase, (although ide-scsi
recognises it later..it still stalls and jitters and complains)
With 2.2.13:
Neither CD device works. The CDR is detected, and the CDROM isn't (as
usual), however the cdrom driver doesn't go near them.
/proc/ide/hd(c|d)/driver reports '(none)' (or 'ide-scsi ...' if I load
that subsequently)
Under 2.2.12, it used to report 'ide-cdrom ...'
Clues? Have I done something daft, or missed a step somewhere?
