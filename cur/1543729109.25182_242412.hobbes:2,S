Detached pagetables are assumed to be freeable after a TLB flush IPI.
Previously holding ->page_table_lock would prevent the shootdowns of
links to the pagetable page from executing concurrently with
modifications to the pagetable page. Disabling interrupts or otherwise
inhibiting the progress of the IPI'ing cpu is needed to prevent
dereferencing freed pagetables and incorrect accounting based on
contents of about-to-be-freed pagetables. Reference counting pagetable
pages may help here, where the final put would be responsible for
unaccounting the various things in the pagetable page.
