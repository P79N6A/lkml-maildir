Yep. However the main bottleneck is to go inside/outside the kernel, the
xtime is one l1 cacheline readonly that can be trivially shared under
high load. I would be surprised if that was the bottleneck, today you
should see an huge bottleneck in the xtime_lock before you can remotely
see a bottleneck in xtime data itself. (I'm speaking HZ=100 at least,
HZ=1000 would hurt more here)

actually my idea on 64bit was to use the high 8 bit of each 64bit word to
give you the cpuid, to get out the coherent data, including the sequence
number that are read and written inversely with mb() like now (the
sequence number as well will become per-cpu), so it is definitely doable
without any single problem and in a very performant way, just not as
easy as without the per-cpu info. Even if segmentation per-cpu tricks
would be possible or available (remeber long mode is pure paging, no
segmentation) it would be not worthwhile IMHO, the cpuid encoded
atomically in each 64bit data provided by the vsyscall seems a much
simpler and possibly more performant solution. You set a different
per-cpu data-mapping with different pte settings in each cpu. The
vsyscall bytecode remains the same, aware about this cpuid encoded in
each 64bit word. Doing it in 32bit is ugly (or at least much slower)
since most data is natively at least 32bit, it would need some slow
demultiplexing.
