you just agreed a second time to make all the pollution go away, so why
are you talking about servers now? I mean, I don't see why production
environments should run the benchmarking testcode. And I totally
disagree CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY disabled could provide any benefit on
a server (even with the benchmarking on). Servers have to start the next
I/O too to avoid leaving some disk idle during a copy-user etc..
let's assume you convert the benchmark sysctl knob into a
CONFIG_LOW_RESCHEDULE_OVERHEAD as I suggested in the 30 lines rant, only
then it could make sense to classify some of the scheduling points as
"high-overhead", but I don't see the need of
CONFIG_LOW_RESCHEDULE_OVERHEAD happening any time soon.  Though such a
config option would make sense theoretically.
