AFIK this was reproduced by Srihari on nohighmem so it must be that
somebody is calling pgd_free_fast on a pgd that cannot be re-used.
Can you try this patch on top of 2.4.20rc2aa1? (or jam0 after backing
out the fast-pte removal that would otherwise forbid the debugging check
to trigger)

the stack trace should tell us who is freeing a not valid pgd.
without this check the crash happens in an innocent place and it's not
obvious why it breaks.
