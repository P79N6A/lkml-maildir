i386, with PnP BIOS support turned off :)
I haven't tried enabling this before, what kind of devices does it
enable?

But what are these devices?  Can you run 'tree' on this so as to
visualize the structure better?

Why?  I don't think there's a need for any other code to need to point
to it.  If in the future it's needed, you can always export it :)

Wrong placement of your {} in the while statement :)
You also might want to not hard code the "7" in the memcmp, but use the
size of the smaller field there, incase things change in the future.

But it still looks like you aren't saving off the needed information in
the dev.driver_data structure.  Or am I missing something?
