Subject: [patch 0/2] use asm() for atomic_{read|set}
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/14/435

I converted i386+x86-64. Compiled, booted and played for a while. The
description of both patches contains the file size of four kernel builds:
- "normal" is 28e8351ac22de25034e048c680014ad824323c65 as it
- "inline asm" is with this patch
- "inline volatile" is *(volatile int *)&(v)->counter as a static inline
  function
- "volatile" is *(volatile int *)&(v)->counter as a #define macro
I hope I don't encourage anyone to use macros over inline functions.
Sebastian
