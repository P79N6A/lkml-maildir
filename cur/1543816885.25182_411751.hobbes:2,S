Yes, hosting providers have been deploying this technology for years.

People who want low overhead and the administrative benefits of only

the host into the guests' filesystems is a huge advantage, even if the
performance benefits can be magically overcome somehow.

Plenty recently.  Check for threads involving (the people on the CC list
to the head of this thread) this year.
Comparing Xen/VMI with Vserver/OpenVZ is comparing apples with orchards.
May I refer you to some slides for a talk I gave at Linux.conf.au about
Vserver:
