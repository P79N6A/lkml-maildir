Subject: [REQUEST] Option for skipping unreadable blocks on Video DVD

If you are accessing a scratched Video DVD and the device cannot read it, the 
process ends. 
What about a more tolerant way to handle unreadable blocks. 
Especially on Video DVDs single blocks are not that important than on data 
dvds.
So is there a way that the kernel tells the device to skip these bad blocks?
