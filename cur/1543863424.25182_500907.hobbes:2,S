Pavel,
It was same with me too, there were some ACPI issues (don't remember
properly).

I am not getting enough time to do the tests for 965 board. I can
volunteer for this ;-) Any guidelines for testing a MOBO to comply
with LKML (am new for testing, have decided to start with this 965
MOBO).
Awaiting for suggestions...
[OT] Are there any issues with 975 (have this board too, but never
tested till now)
