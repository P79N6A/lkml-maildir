I agree that this is the theory. In practise however, I've never
seen it work correctly. We've seen several disks with say 1-5 bad
blocks and nothing else, and "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<disk>" doesn't
seem to cure them.
I know how to check SMART, and I can see that some of these disks
have NEVER reallocated a block. Stuff like that.
