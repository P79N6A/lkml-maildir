Hi,
On Nov.16, Sun has open sourced the
(
http://www.opensolaris.org/os/announcements/#2005-11-16_welcome_to_the_zfs_community_
) ZFS. I know that, It is licensed under CDDL. So, It is not GPL
compatible. In this situation, there is no way for Linux mainline. But
I wonder, is there anybody has a plan to port ZFS for Linux as a
separate patch ?
Cheers!
