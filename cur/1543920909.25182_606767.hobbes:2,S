Ah, I didn't see it was an order of magnitude out.
Some filesystems, including I believe, ext3 with data=ordered,
can leave orphaned pages around after they have been truncated
out of the pagecache. These pages get left on the LRU and vmscan
reclaims them pretty easily.
Try ext3 data=writeback, or even ext2.
