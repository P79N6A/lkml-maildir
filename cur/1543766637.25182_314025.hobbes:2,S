Ok, let's try again - now with explanation, 
since it looks like you did not even try to understand what I said.
If you will remove objects from ->remove() callback
you may end up with rmmod being stuck.
Explanation: each read still gets reference counter, 
while in rmmod path there is a wait until it is zero.
If there are too many simultaneous reads - even
if each will put reference counter at the end, we still can have
non zero refcnt each time we check it in rmmod path.
That is why object must be removed from accessible pathes
first, and only freed in ->remove() callback.

It has explicit barrieres, which guarantees that
there will not be atomic operation vs. non atomic
reordering.
