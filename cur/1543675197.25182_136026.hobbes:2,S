Hello All,
is there any difference if i write kernel module device drivers using
proc_fs in /proc and in a traditional way in /dev directory.
I mean from the application point of view is there any difference when
application tries to access the device using the device driver residing in
/proc directory and not in /dev.
With Thanks,
-Hemanshu
