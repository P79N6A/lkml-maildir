Something like this:
struct notifier_block {
        int (*notifier_call)(struct notifier_block *self, unsigned long,
                void *);
        struct list_head node;
        int priority;
	int enabled;
};
int notifier_call_chain(struct notifier_head *nh, unsigned long val,
void *v)
{
        int ret = 0;
        notifier_block *b;
        if (list_empty(&nh->chain))     /* Optimize for common case */
                return ret;
	smp_rmb();
        list_for_each_entry(b, &nh->chain, node) {
		if (b->enabled) {
	                ret = b->notifier_call(b, val, v);
	                if (ret & NOTIFY_STOP_MASK)
	                        break;
		}
	}
        return ret;
}
#define notifier_block_enable(b)	set_wmb((b)->enabled, 1)
#define notifier_block_disable(b)	set_wmb((b)->enabled, 0)
It occurred to me that there _is_ a way to do unregister for atomic chains 
without blocking.  Add to struct notifier_head
	atomic_t num_callers;
Then in notifier_call_chain, do atomic_inc(&nh->num_callers) at the start
and atomic_dec(&nh->num_callers) at the end.  Finally, make unregister do
this:
int notifier_chain_unregister(struct notifier_head *nh,
        struct notifier_block *n)
{
	if (nh->type == ATOMIC_NOTIFIER) {
	        spin_lock(nh->lock);
	        list_del(&n->node);
		smp_mb();
		while (atomic_read(&nh->num_callers) > 0)
			cpu_relax();
	        spin_unlock(nh->lock);
	} else {
	...
	}
        return 0;
}
I don't mean to suggest that this is better than using RCU, and with 
notifier_block_disable it probably isn't needed.  However it is worth
thinking about.
