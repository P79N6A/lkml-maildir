Yes, but the trouble is that asm/highmem.h simply isn't included in the
!HIGHMEM case, so I can't put anything in there, and putting anything
pv_ops related into linux/highmem.h isn't appropriate either.

OK, if you think it makes a difference.

Well, I could promote kmap_atomic_pte to a first-class interface, but it
seems like overkill.
