Hi,
While my machine (K6-2, VIA MVP3, Linux 2.2.9) is idle, but I am using it (if
you see what I mean) my CPU runs at a temperature of 32C. If I compile heavily
it runs at 49C. OK, now the wierd bit - if I go away and leave it for an hour
when I come back its at 49C... I start light use and the temperature drops
quickly down to 32C again. 
I guess this isn't very important but it does look like the suspend stuff might
be leaving my CPU in a wierd state, and a wierd state which uses more power
than the idle thread. Any ideas? Details on request.
I have APM on in the BIOS and enabled in the kernel but I never see apm related
messages in the logs (apart from bootup message).
