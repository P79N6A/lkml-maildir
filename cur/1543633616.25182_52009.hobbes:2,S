10-25% is roughly equivalent to the hit rates i've seen on my web caches
in real life, with MANY users.  i can't believe people are actually
using this for data accounting.
i also can't think of many decent "free" (whatever your interpretation
of that is) ways to do it either.  interface packet counters wrap
around, most commercial firewalls i've used have inaccurate or
incomplete logging (to put it lightly), and packet sniffers sometimes
can't keep up.
surely if profit (or just keeping your head above the water) is the goal
you can justify the necessary resources to use something like netflow, a
product designed to do exactly what you seem to want, among other
things.  (search cisco.com, and no, i'm not a cisco employee)
fiddling the network stack so that you can do dubious hacks in an
allegedly apparently dubious aspect of squid just doesn't seem to be the
ideal way to fix this problem.

j.
