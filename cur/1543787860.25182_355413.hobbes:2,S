This is checking all zones for pages on the pcp before going the more 
expensive route?
Seems that this removes the logic intended to prefer local 
allocations over remote pages present in the existing alloc_pages? There 
is the danger that this modification will lead to the allocation of remote 
pages even if local pages are available. Thus reducing performance.
I would suggest to just check the first zone's pcp instead of all zones.
