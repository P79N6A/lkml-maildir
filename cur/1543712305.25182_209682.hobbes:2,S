I have a similar problem on Linux PPC. With a 2.6.5-rc2 + your SVN
repo, I get :

The machine is almost freezed then after one minute totally
freezed. All was fine with 2.6.3-ben2 (which was merged in 2.6.4).
It is 100% reproducible. I can enter in the debugger and get a
backtrace. I have to found how to supply System.map since it does not
find it.
