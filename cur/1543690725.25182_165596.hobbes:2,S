That's all fine and dandy.  When the kernel changes its interface, then 
you have to recompile (or rewrite) drivers.  No problem.  I'm just 
trying to avoid having to recompile drivers if the interface DOESN'T change.

I am not interested in adding additional layers of abstraction.  At 
least not here.  I do it plenty of other places, but that's not 
important right now.  If someone else wants to make an abstraction layer 
(which seems to have been done here and there), then that's just fine, 
and I may or may not use it.
My point is that I'm not advocating any of the kruft associated with 
backward-compatible interfaces.  I'm advocating not having to recompile 
only in the cases where the interface DOES NOT change.
Why?  Because there are some advantages to being able to say that this 
one module can be dropped into any box running, for instance, 2.6.12 
through 2.6.16, while the next module is used for 2.6.17 thru 2.6.22, etc.
For distributions, this can be helpful for drivers which are not in the 
mainline kernel.  So, I'm not trying to necessarily find a way to help 
binary-only drivers (although it would, to some extent).
