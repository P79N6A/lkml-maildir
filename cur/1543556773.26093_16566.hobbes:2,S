This is a new BUG-check, where "UnlockPage()" actually verifies that the
page was locked before it unlocks it.
Trying to unlock a page that isn't locked is a nasty bug - if it happens
it probably also means that with some bad luck that unlock could have
unlocked the page that somebody _else_ had locked, and expected to stay
locked until it was unlocked properly.
(It may also be that the BUG() is due to exactly that - somebody else
who didn't have the lock unlocked the page from under you, and the
_proper_ unlocker will in that case be the one that oopses).
Do you have something special that triggers this? Can you test if it
only happens with initrd, for example?
