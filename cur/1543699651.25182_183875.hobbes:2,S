Yep, all this is "devel" stuff that will be pruned up sooner or later (you
mention a few more occurrences, all fall under the same category).
It is disabled by default (and if it wasn't, it was by mistake). I still
don't consider this shipping patches, more an RFC and looking for feedback
(like yours) so that's why I didn't use too much time in removing all that.

Why?? [asides from the obvious side effects]--BUG_ON(), what I'd use given
the need, is an assertion.
Anyway, I don't really use it. These "debugging" macros were a copy and paste 
from one of those bag-o-tricks I have for user space -- I probably use only
a handful of the macros and they will go away.

There are multiple implementations (more about this at the bottom).

Yes, initially it is. I have in the short-term to do the plan to implement
a more efficient, O(1) version (using queue heads for each prio) as I know
I have a hard max of 140 queues (so in worth case, complexity would be
O(140) which is O(1)).
That approach would work quite well, if the added complexity is not too
much. I see the interest for other applications also. I'll try to give
it a shot someday, but I am quite short on bw now. Do you know if there
is some implementation lying around that I can cannibalize? [too lazy to
look around right now]

Geee, it was suspicious nobody had yet complained about it. 
It looks plain ugly, but the propagation has to be quick with no irqs
in the middle, so I could unfold it into using:
local_irq_save()
spin_lock()
spin_unlock()...etc
local_irq_restore()
however, once I was in there, I saw a silly overhead to be doing and 
undoing the preemption when it had to be disabled anyway because of
the interrupts. Maybe it is an small stupid gain, but a gain, after all.
In some places I still have to clean up similar usages which do not
make sense to be unfold (these are the ones that walk the chains
up and down and the fuqueue_wait() one to avoid the resched on unlock).

Look into ufuqueue_ops, ufulock_ops.fuqueue_ops [ufulock.c, ufuqueue.c]. 
The problem is when these guys are being used for user space 
synchronization--then they need to be refcounted; when you use them 
inside the kernel only you control their life cycle and refcounting 
is not necessary.
Now, this still gives you the option to do the refcounting if you have a
kernel fulock embedded in some dynamic object and don't want to do the
management manually...it gives more flexibility, so I think at the end
is worth not to force the management but to keep them in the _ops structure.
Hey, thanks for the feedback!
