Nod. And then there's the problem of HTML spam.

There's a strong perception that 2.0.36 is robust (even though SMP
isn't). I see people pushing for XYZ driver to be added to 2.0.3x for
this reason. I assume if Kim is willing to back-port the GigE driver
to 2.0.36, the option of forward-porting some other driver was also
considered.
As for SMP "requirements": perhaps Kim has a 1 GHz Athalon and figures
that should do nicely :-)
