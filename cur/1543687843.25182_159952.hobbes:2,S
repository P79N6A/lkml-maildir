No, why? What we'll need is to verify the mask at driver startup.
It would be driver responsibility to use only valid (verified) masks.

What do you propose instead?

False. I have a device which needs different mask for consistent allocs.
In fact the whole story began with me trying to put this driver into
the tree.

SBE wanXL sync serial adapter. 32 bits for buffers but 28 bits for
consistent data.

I can't imagine all devices work properly on all platforms wrt
consistent allocs. Say, sound drivers setting only dma_mask to < 32 bits
and expecting consistent alloc will use that and not consistent_dma_mask.
Of course, there is a question if we want to support such sound cards
on Itaniums and Opterons? Of course they work on i386 as
i386 pci_alloc_consistent() ignores consistent_dma_mask.
