Subject: Uh, is kernel.org sending out e-mail to the mailing lists?  I am not getting linux-kernel messages for two days.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/11/21/99

Please reply to me directly, since I am not getting messages from
the list.  Perhaps something is wedged with my ISP.
