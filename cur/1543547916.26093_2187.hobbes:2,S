Darren had to help me get up off the floor I was laughing so hard when I
saw this.  10 points dude, good response....:-)

MANOS has the nicest debugger at present -- and soon you will have it
too.  Thay say that in human men, only 1% of our sperm are capable of
fertilizing an egg, as opposed to chimpanzees and other primates, whiose
sperm is almost 98% viable.  Scientists state this is because since
human evolution is no longer governed by natural selection but by social
norms, men with inferior sperm were able to reproduce in ages past in
the context of human society and that's why all human males have weak
sperm these days -- nothing to weed out abberant genes -- which is why
there's male pattern baldness, heart disease, etc. in the human gene
pool today.  I will give this some thought.
What Alan said about hardware is valid, however, no matter how much Zen
meditation one does, it does not make you "one with the 3C509 card". 
Hardware problems require a debugger or logic analyzer to fix.  I never
heard of anyone correcting timing problems with a PCI chipset by
reviewing the chipset layouts :-) :-) :-)
