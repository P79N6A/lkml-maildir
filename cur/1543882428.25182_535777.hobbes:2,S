Subject: [PATCH -rt] Stop interrupt storm for fasteoi.

Ingo,
I've spent several days banging my head on this bug, and I finally found
it. I originally thought we had a bug with the latency tracer, since it
seemed to only occur when I turned on latency tracing.  But I guess it
just changed the timings to cause the bug to happen. Now that I found
where the bug is, I don't know how it ever worked, even without the
tracing.
When taking an Ethernet interrupt, it was handled by handle_fasteoi_irq.
handle_fasteoi_irq, when the irq is handled by a thread, sets the irq
INPROGRESS and masks the irq.
Before leaving handle_fasteoi_irq, a call to desc->chip->eoi is called.
For the apic, this will call move_native_irq.
In the -rt kernel, move_native_irq masks the irq, moves it, and then
blindly unmasks it.  So when interrupts are turned on next, we take an
interrupt storm.
The other handlers besides handle_fasteoi_irq mask the irq regardless of
whether the irq is INPROGRESS.  But handle_fasteoi_irq will not mask it,
if the irq is already INPROGRESS, and just returns. So we keep taking
the same interrupt.
So, I change move_native_irq to not mask and unmask if the irq is
currently INPROGRESS.  But... I'm not sure if this is ok or not, since I
don't know all the uses to this.
My original patch was just to do a

         move_masked_irq(irq);

But I thought that this might be too big of a hammer to this nail. So I
changed it to the patch below.
