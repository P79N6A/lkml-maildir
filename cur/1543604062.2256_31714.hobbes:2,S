Hm. Perhaps when I did my tests (where I noticed a penalty), we didn't
have lazy FPU saving. Now we disable the FPU, and restore state when
we trap, right?
I do note this comment in arch/i386/kernel/process.c:
 * We fsave/fwait so that an exception goes off at the right time
 * (as a call from the fsave or fwait in effect) rather than to
 * the wrong process. Lazy FP saving no longer makes any sense
 * with modern CPU's, and this simplifies a lot of things (SMP
 * and UP become the same).
So what exactly is the difference between our "delayed FPU restore
upon trap" (which I think of as lazy FPU saving), and the "lazy FP"
saving in the comments?
