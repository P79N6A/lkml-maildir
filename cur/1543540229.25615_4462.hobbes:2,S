hi all,
	I am a newcomer to the world of linux. I have few queries which i guess u
could explain.
	1) how does the kernel maintain the cwd for a process ?
	2) how is the 'cd' command implemented in the kernel?
	3) which are the related files ?
	Your early response is appreciated.
	Please do reply.
	Thanks in advance.
Rahul
