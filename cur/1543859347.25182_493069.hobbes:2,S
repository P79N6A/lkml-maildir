Other than indentation/whitespace bugs, it seems to encapsulate the
layering violation needed to get those deprecated files working again
for PCI (and platform_bus).   I'd rename the new bus method though;
maybe "pm_has_noirq_stage()" or somesuch.  Your name is so generic that
it'd be a surprise if the answer were ever "no"!
You should also list this new call in the feature-removal.txt entry for
stuff that gets removed with /sys/devices/.../power/state files, since
it's another mechanism that only exists to prop up that broken API,
and should vanish at the same time that API does.
