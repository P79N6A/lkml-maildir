Looks good.
When I suggested a user interface to enable/disable probes was nice to
have I was more thinking about a interface to enable/disable individual
probes.  Any chance you could try to implement that aswell as see if
any code can be shared with this feature?

This printk seems far too verbose.  Just remove it and make sure
the debugfs interface has an indicator of whether probes are en- or
disabled.
