well, in this case, you can simply modify your early boot scripts (eg. rc.S)
to link /lib/modules/`uname -r` to /lib/modules/`uname-r`-something, where
'something' is determined from some information grabbed in /proc
(/proc/version ?) or anything that can give you enough knowledge about
your running kernel.
This is clearly realizable and doesn't need any changes to modutils.
To install the modules at the right place, set the environment variable
INSTALL_MOD_PATH to the proper directory before you do a
'make modules_install'
