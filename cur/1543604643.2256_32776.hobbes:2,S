 When i tried bestcrypt (a crypto-fs) with the new 2.4.12 kernel, i got a 
ooops when mounting a device. The oops was in this line:
(in bcrypt-0.8-6/mod/bc_dev24.c)
               root = current->fs->rootmnt;
               list_for_each(ptr, &root->mnt_list) {
                        mnt = list_entry(ptr, struct vfsmount, mnt_list);
                        sb = mnt ? mnt->mnt_sb : NULL;
                         if (NULL != sb && dev == sb->s_dev) <============
                                        mntget(mnt);
                }
 The oops was a pointer dereference to 0x9. I added some printk's to see the 
values of the pointers. I did see that in the last 'struct vfsmount' linked 
inside root->mnt_list, the mnt_sb field is '0x1', so when it tries to access 
sb->sb_dev it dereferences a pointer to 0x9. The field mnt_devname was NULL.
 ¿Is this a bug in the kernel or a bug in bestcrypt?
