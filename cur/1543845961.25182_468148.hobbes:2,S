The patch I posted earlier is all that's needed, if you could merge it
into #pciseg that would be fine. I'm pondering making one small
change though: in your pci domains patch, you have this snippet:
+#ifdef CONFIG_PCI_DOMAINS
+static inline int pci_domain_nr(struct pci_bus *bus)
+{
+	struct pci_sysdata *sd = bus->sysdata;
+	return sd->domain;
+}
+
+static inline int pci_proc_domain(struct pci_bus *bus)
+{
+	return pci_domain_nr(bus);
+}
+#endif /* CONFIG_PCI_DOMAINS */
So pci_domain_nr and pci_proc_domain are only available if
CONFIG_PCI_DOMAINS is defined. I followed suit and make pci_iommu only
available if CONFIG_CALGARY_IOMMU is defined, but perhaps it would be
better to make it unconditional, since ->sysdata will always be
available anyway. Was there a specific reason why pci_domain_nr is
only available if CONFIG_PCI_DOMAINS?
Cheers,
Muli
