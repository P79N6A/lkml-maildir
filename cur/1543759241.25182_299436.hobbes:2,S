Looking at the 
http://l4x.org/k/
 site, it appears that all -mm versions
have broken ARM support with the defconfig, while Linus kernels at least
build fine. I've no idea why though.
I haven't had any reports of breakage, and I don't think I've missed
any heads up on something which needs to be fixed up, except maybe the
4 level page table stuff.  (TBH I don't think many ARM people look at
-mm, but it is worrying that something which may be merged into Linus'
tree from -mm may have the unexpected consequence of breaking something
which used to work.)
Unfortunately, 
http://l4x.org/k/
 doesn't save any build logs for
investigation.
