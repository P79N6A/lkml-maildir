Make this generic by passing in compare and swap functions and stick it in
lib. Heapsort is indeed a better candidate for a kernel algorithm than the
simpler qsorts because of the constrained worst case. If I remember
correctly, heapsort performs about as well as combsort in my testing -
within a constant factor of two of qsort's best case.
