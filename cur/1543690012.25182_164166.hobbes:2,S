In a way, it would have been nice if "sys_statfs64()" had implemented the
values as "files in use" and "files total" instead of the older (and less
useful "files free").
However, that doesn't mean you can't return something useful to statfs().
Since the linux VFS limits us to 2^32 - 1 inodes for now, you could still
return 2^32 - 1 - num_in_use for "f_ffree" and 2^32 -1 for f_files, so that
"df -i" shows a useful number for IUsed.
Sadly, the sys_statfs64() API is broken such that the filesystem can't make
a distinction between being called from sys_statfs64() and sys_statfs(),
so you have to assume the 32-bit limits even for the 64-bit API.  We should
really have a new FS method which is "statfs64()" that is optionally called
from sys_statfs64() so the FS has a chance to return something different for
64-bit callers.
For Lustre, we can't be guaranteed to fit into the 32-bit f_blocks counts
with 100TB filesystems, so we scale the f_bsize until the f_blocks fits into
32 bits.  However, we would like to be able to return the correct values to
sys_statfs64() if possible.
Cheers, Andreas
