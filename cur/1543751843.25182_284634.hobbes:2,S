Side note: the SMP numbers seem to fluctuate wildly making any
benchmarking a bit suspect. They probably depend very much on just how
things get scheduled, and on inter-CPU cache behaviour.
In contrast, the UP numbers are a lot more reliable, so I'll try to make
sure that everything looks good on UP - which definitely means that I'll
work to make sure that latency looks good too.
