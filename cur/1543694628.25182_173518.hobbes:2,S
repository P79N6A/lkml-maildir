The decompression-side ones, yes.  (Modulo different command line arguments, 
and that I didn't implement the "small mode" that's slower but uses less 
memory.  That would probably only add a couple hundred bytes, and I could 
make it a compile time option, but I just haven't gotten around to it yet.  
If somebody wants to send me a patch... :)
Mostly I've been repeatedly extracting linux-2.6.0-test6.tar.bz2 as my 
testcase.  Much more of a workout. :)

Manuel Novoa submitted a patch that sped things up over 10% (seriously cool, 
that's why we're faster than the original), but broke the 80 column thing 
(mostly a couple return statements that need to be on the next line).
I'm happy to take a patch to clean it up. :)

That was the original reason for doing this, yes. :)
Eric Anderson pointed me to the new home of the kernel bunzip patch, which is 
at "
http://shepard.kicks-ass.net/~cc/",
 and I'll take a stab at porting it to 
2.6.0-test8 as the mood strikes me. :)
