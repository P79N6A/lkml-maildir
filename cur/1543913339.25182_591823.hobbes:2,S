Thanks. That will be more flexible.

I retested 2.6.22 and booted kernel with "slub_max_order=3 slub_min_objects=8".
The result is about 8.7% better than without booting parameters.
So all with booting parameter "slub_max_order=3 slub_min_objects=8", 2.6.22 is
about 5.8% better than 2.6.23-rc4. I suspect process scheduler is responsible
for the 5.8% regressions.
