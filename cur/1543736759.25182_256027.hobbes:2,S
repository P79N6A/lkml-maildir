Hi Russell, all.
For #1, we (Digi) still must support all of the 2.4.x series of kernels
with this driver, so we are unable to convert to the serial_core layer
at this time.
For #2 and #3, IBM and I are in the process of making the changes you
suggest.
Thanks!

A few comments:
(1) I'm disappointed that you aren't using the serial_core support
    in drivers/serial.
(2) I'm also concerned that you're using serial_reg.h as a description
    of an interface between your hardware specific drivers and your
    hardware independent tty core.  It isn't a description of such an
    interface and therefore should not be used as such.  Please fix
    your code in respect to this.
(3) loopback mode is normally enabled by setting TIOCM_LOOP modem
    control bit via the TIOCMBIS ioctl.
I'd also like Alan Cox to look over the driver since he's looking at
the tty layer.  Alan may have further comments since I've only briefly
looked through it.
