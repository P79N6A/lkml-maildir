The agp_bridge_find function pointer is bogus, that way you can only support
one backend at a time.  I'm not really sure how to do that propery, best have
the generic code walk down the pci device parent chain until it finds an AGP
bridge and allow drivers that don't present their bridges as PCI devices to
supply additional ways to search.
Most other bits of the patch are fine, but in either case you first need to
change the agp bridge driver API to take a struct agp_bridge_data in every
method, else all these changes don't make sense at all.
