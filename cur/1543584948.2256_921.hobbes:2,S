The problem:
drivers change their detection schemes; and changes in the kernel can
change the order in which devices are assigned names.
For example, the DAC960(?) drivers changed their order of
detecting controllers, and I did _not_ have fun, given that the machine in
question had about 40 disks to deal with, spread across two controllers.
This can create a lot of problems for people upgrading large, production
quality systems -- as, in the worst case, the system won't complete the
boot cycle; or in middle cases, the user/sysadmin is stuck rewriting X
amount of files and trying again; or in small cases, you find out that
your SMC and Intel ethernet cards are reversed, and have to go fix things
...
Possible solutions(?):
Solaris uses an /etc/path_to_inst file, to keep track of device ordering,
et al.
Maybe we should consider something similar, where a physical device to
logical device map is kept and used to keep things consistent on
kernel/driver changes; device addition/removal, and so forth ...
I am, of course, open to better solutions.
