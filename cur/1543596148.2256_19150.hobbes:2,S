Before we go and create a patch for Linus to apply, please note that the
above is totally bogus and is in fact 100% wrong.  Don't create a patch
yourself.  Let me know how you propose to do it, and I will create the
patch using the correct symbols.
Also note that the majority of the machine-dependent symbols for StrongARM
platforms (of which there are around 43) start CONFIG_SA1100_*, not
CONFIG_ARCH_*.  Unfortunately, its far too late to get around this
special case (I'm not too happy that we have this special case either,
so don't whinge at me please).
