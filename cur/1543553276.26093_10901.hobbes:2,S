Well, given that this is linux-*kernel* mailing list, the answer
seems appropriate.
You didn't say you couldn't use 2.4.  And anyway, UML runs under the 
latest 2.2 kernels.
Was it a joke?  Well, maybe.  Networking isn't UML's strong point.
I am not aware of any userspace NFSv3 server.  Your best bet would
probably to take the v2 server and mutate it.  Why do you want this beast?
