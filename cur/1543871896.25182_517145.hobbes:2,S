With sane hardware yes. But there is no sane hardware. You need a (<=)
match machinery instead of the available (==) ones, which introduce
extra latencies and incorrectness. See arch/i386/kernel/hpet.c. We can
end up with returning -ETIME and an interrupt, as we have no control
over SMM code and such crap at all. For such devices the delta based
expiry is actually faster, as it avoids the calculation of wraps and the
possible 128 bit math in the reprogramming path.
This correctness discussion is purely hypothetical on current real world
hardware.

Please put the clever solution inside of the clockevent. I can provide
the absolute time in nanoseconds without making you touch the
clockevent->next_event variable.
