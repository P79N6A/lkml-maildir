Interesting, I forgot about the "* nr_cpus" that was in the granularity 
calculation.  That does make me wonder, maybe the timeslices you are 
calculating could have something similar, but more appropriate.  
Since the number of runnable tasks on a cpu should play a part in latency (the 
more tasks, potentially the longer the latency), I wonder if the timeslice 
would benefit from a modifier like " / task_cpu(p)->nr_running ".  With this 
the base timeslice could be quite a bit larger to start for better cache 
warmth, and as we add more tasks to that cpu, the timeslices get smaller, so 
an acceptable latency is preserved.

OK, thanks!
