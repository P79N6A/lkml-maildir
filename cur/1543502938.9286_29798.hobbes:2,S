Does it require that for kill -9 too?
If no, it could be handled in a _exit hook in user space.

This sounds reasonable. CLONE_WAIT  ? Shouldn't be that hard to implement.

Linus has very strong feelings against this, and i think he is right there.
Stack management should be done in user space. You would just move some stuff
that can be equally well done in user space into a giant system call.

This already exists. Do prctl(PR_SET_DEATHSIG, SOME_NEW_SIGNAL) in the child
and ignore that signal in the parent (at least it should work in theory,
I haven't tested it)
Other things I would like to add to the kernel for better linuxthreads: 
- cmpxchg kernel emulation for 386.
Currently linuxthreads do 2 function calls, a switch (to check lock types) and 
a if (to check if the cpu has cmpxchg) for the uncongested case. If it was 
guaranteed that cmpxchg works on all cpus that could be optimized heavily by
inlining the cmpxchg and only dropping to the functions if the lock is congested.
This would make uncongested locks very cheap. It would slow down the 386er a 
bit, but these are hopeless for threads anyways
because of the user access races.
required kernel changes: straight forward emulation in the kernel SIGILL handler,
code size is directly proportional to the number of weird addressing modes
emulated (and kernels compiled for >386 won't see it anyways)
- a vm id for ps support:
add a pid field to the "mm_struct" that is shared by CLONE_VM; initialise this
field when the mm_struct is first created and don't change it for clones; then
make it available via proc/<pid>/something. This would allow ps to find all
"threads", and would allow gdb to attach to already running "thread sets"
required kernel changes are about 5-10 lines.
- support to write register sets for all threads that use the vm into the core 
dump.
