I fail to see how this is a reply to my message.  I was asking for 
clarification on what "higher layer" supposedly resulted in this 
behavior ( of not being able to access any part of the disk ) because as 
far as I know, all the higher layers are quite happy to access the non 
broken parts of the disk, and return the appropriate error to the 
calling application for the bad parts of the disk.
