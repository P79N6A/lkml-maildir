Assuming I'm running a reasonably recent kernel 2.6 kernel, does anyone
have any positive confirmation the above setup works, or does not work?
Or any gotchas? I can't *see* explicit support for the 9550 in two obvious
3-ware files in mainline, but then I can't see explicit support for a 9500
either, and that (allegedly) does work.
Bonus points if you can tell me whether ubuntu breezy badger will boot &
install without mods.
