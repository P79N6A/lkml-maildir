Sure CFLAGS should be configurable, but CONFIG_TINY should always prefer
-Os over -O2. From 'man gcc':
       -Os Optimize for size.  -Os enables all -O2 optimizations that do not
           typically increase code size.  It also performs further optimiza-
           tions designed to reduce code size.
If gcc regularly generates larger code with -Os the answer is to talk to
the gcc people, not to avoid using -Os...
