OK, it's maintained, but not developed...

They are not enough. Eric did already make necessary changes and kernel does
NOT crash any more when cat'ing /proc/scsi/gdth/0. But it does hung
occasionally with processes stuck in D state. System is alive, but there is
not responce from disks hooked to gdt controller. Neither emergency sync nor
unmount from SysRQ work. All another options do.

I'm ready to help in any way I can to get the bugs fixed. Pls let me know
