This is basically what I was referring to pre-merge.  And it is still
not fully sufficient.  Multiple processes can share an fd.  So the test
against current is broken.  Also well-behaved apps that are already
using O_EXCL will break.  Using filp as the holder is sufficient to fix
both of these issues.  Here's a 3.5/8 that will fix this.  6/8 no longer
applies cleanly with this change.
