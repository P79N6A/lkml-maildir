Ok, the kernel compiled with gcc version 3.2.1 20021207 (Red Hat Linux 8.0
3.2.1-2) has now been up for more than a week. It seems stable, but I'm not
sure yet.
Which brings me to the question: which gcc version is considered most stable
for compiling 2.4.x these days?
README says:
"Make sure you have gcc 2.95.3 available.  gcc 2.91.66 (egcs-1.1.2) may
also work but is not as safe, and *gcc 2.7.2.3 is no longer supported*"
And Documentation/Changes says:
"You may use gcc 3.0.x instead if you wish, although it may cause problems.
Later versions of gcc have not received much testing for Linux kernel
compilation, and there are almost certainly bugs (mainly, but not
exclusively, in the kernel) that will need to be fixed in order to use these
compilers."
and
"The Red Hat gcc 2.96 compiler subtree can also be used to build this tree.
You should ensure you use gcc-2.96-74 or later. gcc-2.96-54 will not build
the kernel correctly."
This seems to suggest 2.96-85 would be more stable than gcc-3.2.1-2. Is this
the case?

I guess I'll poll Justin when/if the aic7xxx crashes reappear. The hang was
probably not related to aic7xxx. Sorry for the false accusation.
