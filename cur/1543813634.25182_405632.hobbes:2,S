Hello *, 
	  i have a small patch for a Problem that i had.
On the MSI-K8T-NEO2 FIR ( Athlon-64, Socket 939 with VIA-K8T800- Chipset 
and onboard Sound,... ) the BIOS lets you choose "DISABLED" or "AUTO" 
for the On-Board Sound Device.
If you add another PCI-Sound-Card the BIOS disables the on-board device.
So far I have a Quirk, that does set the correspondent BIT in the PCI-registers
to enable the soundcard. 
But i have another 2 problems:
- how to enshure that the code is executed ONLY on excactly this kind of boards
 (not any other with similar Chipset)?
- what to do to (hopefully) integrate that pice of code into
  one of the next Kernel Releases?
