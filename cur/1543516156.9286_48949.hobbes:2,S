generally there were no changes in the 'core' kernel that were purely
highmem-motivated. All of the changes were basically cleanups which make
conceptual sense to other architectures as well. Eg. the VM cleanup wrt.
'struct page *' simplified the code by separating virtual and physical
addresses, bootmem allows more efficient use of RAM and a much more
complex RAM setup, the zone-allocator enables NUMA (and other types of
assymetric memory configurations) and uses less RAM. Maybe the only thing
that is unique to highmem is 'kmap(page)/kunmap(page)', but i think the
current interface is low-impact enough.
