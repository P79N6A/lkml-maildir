Greetings all,
I have an embedded box which is having an absolute fit at the moment. I have
a 48 MB Sandisk Compact Flash card with a single ext2 partition, running on
a Lippert Cyrix MediaGX-based PC-104 board. Certain activities cause it to
explode, for example find / will do it nicely - the following is a condensed
dmesg output (full thing on 
http://ieee.uow.edu.au/~daniel/explosion.log
)
VFS: Disk change detected on device 16:00
/dev/ide/host0/bus1/target0/lun0: p1
VFS: Disk change detected on device 16:01
VFS: busy inodes on changed media..

EXT2-fs error (device ide1(22,1)): ext2_write_inode: unable to read inode block
Remounting filesystem read-only
The disk-change thing doesn't sound real healthy.
kernel is 2.4.16 (compiled with MediaGX optimisations - .config is on
http://ieee.uow.edu.au/~daniel/kernel.config
)
gcc is 2.95.4
binutils is 2.11.90.0.24
Please CC me as I'm not currently on LKML.
Thanks,
- Daniel
