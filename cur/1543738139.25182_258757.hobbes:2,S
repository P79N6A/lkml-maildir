Total set of patches to boot:
- your latest fix
- revert optimize profile + Andi's patch
- uhci fix (still needed ?)
- e100 fix (only thing I have seen at the moment...)
- 1Gb lowmem
How about including the last one in -mm, for testing ? I use it in a server
and in my home workstation and it works fine (even with nvidia drivers ;) ).
Everything attached (they are really small...)
