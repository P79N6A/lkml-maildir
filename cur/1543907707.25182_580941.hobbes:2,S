I think it's important to distinguish between the LAPIC receiving an
interrupt and the CPU receiving an interrupt.  The former could happen
without the latter if the CPU has set the TPR above the priority of
the interrupt received by the LAPIC.  In that case, the interrupt is
kept pending in the LAPIC and recorded in the IRR if I understand the
Intel documentation correctly.
So I think the scenario which leaves IRR set when the kdump kernel
starts is possible.
