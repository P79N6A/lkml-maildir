All versions up to 2.4.20 report the same information and 2.6 
is one snapshot from Linus bk 2003-10-29. 
I tested on another machine which the same chipset (but more recent
bk snapshot) and the behaviour is ok. I'm updating the kernel on 
the machine that reproduces this bug to see if happens again.
