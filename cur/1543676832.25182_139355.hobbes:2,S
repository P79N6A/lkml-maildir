Original problem summary: plug in USB flash disk on 2.5.70 SCSI system,
	and watch machine lock up solid.
Followup test results: 
	Also broken on 2.5.70 IDE system, although lockup doesn't
	occur until you attempt to access (mount) the disk.
	Works fine with 2.4.20 on both SCSI and IDE systems to which
	I have access.
Matthew (and other usb-storage folks): any idea what's going on here?
Problem seems to point to something in the SCSI emulation layer, which
makes a little sense considering the ide-scsi folks went through
similar pain not long ago.  Thanks!
