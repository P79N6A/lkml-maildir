Hello!!!
 I am sorry for the letter, but already some weeks testing with subject.
Has established Promise SX-6000 RAID. Has compiled an original nucleus
2.6.5_rc2.
 In make menuconfig has disconnected support of all PDC Promise. Has
included all I2O devices in a nucleus.
ns linux # cat .config|grep I2O
# I2O device support
CONFIG_I2O=y
CONFIG_I2O_PCI=y
CONFIG_I2O_BLOCK=y
CONFIG_I2O_SCSI=y
CONFIG_I2O_PROC=y
