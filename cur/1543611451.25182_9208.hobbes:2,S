If you've got a more effective way of getting people to do the right thing,
lets hear it.  Remember, the goal is to protect the source base, not your,
my, or another's ego.
I used to think Sun's approach was pretty brutal, and I still do actually.
But I haven't found anything else which works as well.  I don't use that
technique at BitMover, instead I rewrite code that I find offensive.  That's
less annoying to the engineers but it is also a lot more costly in terms of
my time.  Since we're a small company, I can keep up.  When we double in
size, I won't be able to do so and I suspect we'll revert to the Sun way.
