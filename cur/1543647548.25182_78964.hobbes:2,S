Hi All,
Heres a tivial mm (MMU-less) patch that cleans up many of
the "#ifdef COFNIG_MMU" littered all over the mm/* files.
The Makefile now chooses which files to compile appropriately.
http://www.uclinux.org/pub/uClinux/uClinux-2.5.x/linux-2.5.41uc2-mm.patch.gz
This leaves the following files as the only ones with
conditionals:
   mm/filemap.c
   mm/mmap.c
   mm/page_alloc.c
   mm/page_io.c
   mm/slab.c
   mm/swap_state.c
   mm/swapfile.c
   mm/vmscan.c
I have a patch from Christoph that will take care of much
of the swap stuff still to apply.
Regards
Greg
