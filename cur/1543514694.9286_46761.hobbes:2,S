Does d_parent mean that  it points to this dentry's parent node? I am really
confused.

"all children " means whose children? this dentry's childrenor this dentry's
parent's children?  In the Dcache.h, "d_subdirs" is explained as "our
children". I am very much confused.

In Dcache.h, "d_children" is explained as "child of parent list". that is to
say, it points to this dentry's parent's children , instead of pointing to this
dentry's own children? right?
If so, why can d_subdirs and d_child make up of a cyclic list?
What's the difference or relationship between them?

Sorry, I still cannot distinguish between d_mounts and d_covers. Say a
example, if /dev/cdrom is mounted under /mnt , then what does d_mounts and
d_covers mean respectively? What's the difference or relationship between them?
