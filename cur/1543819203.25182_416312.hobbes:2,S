My question is if the irqbalance util is really needed to activate IRQ 
balancing these days. Which kernel versions and higher (2.4xx and 
2.6.xx) do need this tool? 
To my understanding can a Linux/UNIX kernel not be called SMP if it 
does not activate Symmetric IRQ balancing out of the box. Why was 
irqbalance introduced as a tool inside kernel-utils in the 1st place?  
In other words: What happened to the Linux kernel that we today now 
need a tool called irqbalance ?
