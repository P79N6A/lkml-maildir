No, AIX and IRIX do it that way because their processes are so bloated
that it would be unthinkable to do a 1:1 model.
Instead of taking the traditional "we've screwed up the normal system 
primitives so we'll event new lightweight ones" try this:
We depend on the system primitives to not be broken or slow.
If that's a true statement, and in Linux it tends to be far more true
than other operating systems, then there is no reason to have M:N.
