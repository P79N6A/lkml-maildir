   tux is more an application than an interface or mechanism.  applications
   historically haven't been distributed as part of the main kernel tree.
Arguable nfsd is an application.
Providing a direct in-kernel link between the page cache and providing
content (be it HTTP, FTP, NFS files, whatever) over sockets is a very
powerful concept.
