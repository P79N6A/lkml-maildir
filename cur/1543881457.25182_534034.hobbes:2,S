I don't see why; once ptep_test_and_clear_young has returned, the
entry in the hash table has already been removed.  Adding the
tlb_remove_tlb_entry call certainly won't do anything on 64-bit
powerpc, since it expands to do {} while (0) there, and in fact it
won't do anything on 32-bit powerpc either.
