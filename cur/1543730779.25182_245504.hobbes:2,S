Hello all,
I have a strange problem here, and after 2 days trying everything I can't
seem to resolve.
Running Slackware 10 - with handrolled 2.4.27 kernel.
/dev/hdc ==
ATAPI CD-ROM, with removable media
        Model Number:       R/RW 8x4x32
        Serial Number:      4VO5045DM02453
        Firmware Revision:  2,0
/dev/hdd ==
ATAPI CD-ROM, with removable media
        Model Number:       CRD-8520B
        Serial Number:      2000/05/08
        Firmware Revision:  1.00
dmesg:
Aug 22 13:00:59 linuxamd kernel: hdc: R/RW 8x4x32, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
Aug 22 13:00:59 linuxamd kernel: hdd: CRD-8520B, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
Aug 22 13:00:59 linuxamd kernel: hdd: attached ide-cdrom driver.
Aug 22 13:00:59 linuxamd kernel: hdc: attached ide-scsi driver.
Aug 22 13:00:59 linuxamd kernel:   Vendor: IDE-CD    Model: R/RW 8x4x32
Rev:  2,0
Aug 22 13:00:59 linuxamd kernel:   Type:   CD-ROM
ANSI SCSI revision: 02
/dev/hdc I use the scsi emulation with boot append="hdc=ide-scsi"
/dev/cdrom -> /dev/hdd
The /dev/hdc writer is fine, and functions perfectly.
But with the normal cd drive on /dev/hdd, any time I open KFM, or do a
mount/umount from console, I get this in syslogs:
Aug 25 15:53:33 linuxamd kernel: hdd: packet command error: status=0x51
{ DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
Aug 25 15:53:33 linuxamd kernel: hdd: packet command error: error=0xa0
But the drive will mount OK, and all works as it should.  Just these logs
all the time.
I have changed cables, I have turned off dma on hdd, I have messed with DMA
and PIO modes - tried everything.
Has anybody any ideas whatever causes this?
TIA,
Nick
