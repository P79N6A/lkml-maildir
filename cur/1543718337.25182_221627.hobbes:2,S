I all,
  sorry for posting this issue here, but I don't know a better place.
My propose is to prepend every message coming from this ML with a fixed and 
significant string, my choice is "[LKML]: "
It is true I can already filter the ML header, but such a string would be a 
great aid for an eye-driven search whenever I had to look at my inbox from a 
pine on a machine different from the mine.
tnx
