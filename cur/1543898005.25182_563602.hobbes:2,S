Let's try something a lot less complex than mounting. Try running:
	dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/dev/null count=100
If that fails, then you should either have some revealing output in dmesg or
your device nodes must be wrong somehow.
If it succeeds, then there is some problem reading the filesystem off the card.
Have you tried mounting the card in some other system?
