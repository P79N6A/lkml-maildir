It works, thanks.
Now, I'm able to suspend the box, seemingly, but there are some problems with 
resuming.  There is a crash related to USB (gets "fixed" if I unload usb_ohci 
etc. before suspending) and a preepmtion problem.  I'll send some traces as 
soon as I can get output from the serial console.  In the meantime, I'll try 
to compile out preemption.
Greets,
