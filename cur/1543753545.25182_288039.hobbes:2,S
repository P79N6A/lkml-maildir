How would you map that to interpreted languages? Bash may not be an 
issue (in general), but perl, java, SQL, etc, would be. People other 
than software developers do write in some of those.

That's true, but in practice an administrator who disagrees with a 
developer gets to maintain their own application or O/S, and most users 
have no recourse but to go to another O/S or app. Which makes it far 
more practical to explain a point than to storm off and do it yourself 
and have to maintain it forever.
