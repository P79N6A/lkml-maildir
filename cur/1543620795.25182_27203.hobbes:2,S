For ISA devices pass NULL. For the PCI devices you get it when you do the
initial PCI probing. So for the cs46xx you'll see its passed to cs46xx_probe()
and saved in card->pci_dev for future use. So you can get it from there.
If you are going to hack on cs46xx.c please pick up the one from 2.4.18pre9
and use that not the one in 2.5 , unless someone also updated that to
match the 2.4 changes. The one in 2.5 seems to still have holes where any 
user can oops the system that will get fixed by porting forward the current
driver
