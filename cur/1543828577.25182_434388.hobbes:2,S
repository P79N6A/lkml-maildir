No arguments; that's a different question.
I'm _not_ saying that you should <something>.
I'm saying that often _I_ am curious about the log _in_ _some_ _remote_ _tree_.
Preferably - without fetch + git log + rm .git/refs/tmp + git prune, which
is how I do that now.  git prune is quite slow, for one thing...
It's not about kernel or getting stuff merged; the question is about git
and cheaper way to do the thing I often find useful.  IOW, read that as
"BTW, is there a way to get such information out of git without too much
PITA?"
