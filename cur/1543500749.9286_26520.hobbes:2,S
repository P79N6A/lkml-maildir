	Right. Except that UFS has not only generic attibutes. For example,
you have UF_NODUMP and SF_ARCHIVED. The *only* place in the /sys you
mention the former is sys/stat.h (BTW, you don't even map it on
EXT2_NODUMP_FL). The latter is mentioned only in the msdosfs/msdosfs_vnops.c.
Hardly a VFS flag, right?
	Proposed API on the Linux side being
int chflags(name, level, oldp, newp); where level is FL_VFS for generic
attirbutes (fs may map them on its own set) and FL_{UFS,EXT2,...} for raw
flags - corresponding filesystem is free to interpret the thing as it
likes and should set the generic attributes in the right way. If you are
trying to talk with the wrong filesystem (i.e. the level is not FL_VFS and
not FL_<filesystem_where_the_object_sits>) you are getting an error. If
oldp is not NULL *oldp contains the attributes to set. if newp is not
NULL *newp will contain the attributes *after* operation. IMO it's cleaner
than pushing all attributes into the single bitmap.
