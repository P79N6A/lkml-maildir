Subject: [PATCH 0/6] read-only bind mount prep work
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following patches lay some of the groundwork for the
read-only bind mounts.  Christoph Hellwig suggested that
I send them in separately.  This was a good suggestion,
as the bulk of the modifications of the entire set happen
in here, and these should make no functional changes, and
should be pretty easy to merge.
