I did that, only to revert it later, because I didn't think it would make
any difference - processes that get to that point will try to free up
memory on their own anyway. 
Note that it wouldn't ever trigger for GFP_ATOMIC allocations, so I
suspect you haven't actually _tried_ it? For a machine that gets burst of
network traffic with nothing else going on, adding it should essentially
amount to a no-op.
I'll look at your other patch.
