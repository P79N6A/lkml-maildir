cool! I like this even more than i liked your original staircase 
scheduler from 2 years ago :) Lets try what we did back then: put it 
into -mm and see what breaks (if anything). But in general, it is 
becoming increasingly clear that the interactivity estimator is a more 
fragile concept than the built-in quota mechanism of the staircase 
scheduler, so if it works in practice i'm quite in favor of it, even if 
it regresses /some/ workloads.
