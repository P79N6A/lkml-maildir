Not really. All of the x86_64 kernels are NUMA enabled and most Intel x86_64
systems today are non NUMA.

Ingo, pardon me! Actually I used NUMA domain as an excuse to push domain
degenerate patch.... As I mentioned earlier, we should remove SMT domain
on a non-HT capable system.
Similarly I am working on adding a new core domain for dual-core systems!
All these domains are unnecessary and cause performance isssues on
non Multi-threading/Multi-core capable cpus! Agreed that performance 
impact will be minor but still...
thanks,
