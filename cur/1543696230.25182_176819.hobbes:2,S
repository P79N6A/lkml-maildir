I'd like to seea sysctl controlled version, but with a bit of cleanup (or
maube as is -- need to re-read it) it is 'safe' for 2.6.0.  Linus may
disagree, and we all have to admit that it is not 'stabilization' but a
feature.
No harm waiting for 2.6.1, though we should get it posted publicly as a
pending patch.
