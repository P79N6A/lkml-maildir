Well, I just tested various user programs and indeed got this
strange result :
Here I call splice() with len=1000 (0x3e8), and you can see
it gives a result of 1460 at the second call.
I suspect a bug in splice code, that my patch just exposed.
pipe([3, 4])                            = 0
open("/dev/null", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0644) = 5
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 6
bind(6, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(4711), sin_addr=inet_addr("0.0.0.0")}, 16) = 0
listen(6, 5)                            = 0
accept(6, 0, NULL)                      = 7
setsockopt(7, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVLOWAT, [1000], 4) = 0
poll([{fd=7, events=POLLIN, revents=POLLIN}], 1, -1) = 1
splice(0x7, 0, 0x4, 0, 0x3e8, 0x3)      = 1000                OK
splice(0x3, 0, 0x5, 0, 0x3e8, 0x5)      = 1000
poll([{fd=7, events=POLLIN, revents=POLLIN}], 1, -1) = 1
splice(0x7, 0, 0x4, 0, 0x3e8, 0x3)      = 1460                Oh well... 1460 > 1000 !!!
splice(0x3, 0, 0x5, 0, 0x5b4, 0x5)      = 1460
poll([{fd=7, events=POLLIN, revents=POLLIN}], 1, -1) = 1
splice(0x7, 0, 0x4, 0, 0x3e8, 0x3)      = 1460
splice(0x3, 0, 0x5, 0, 0x5b4, 0x5)      = 1460
