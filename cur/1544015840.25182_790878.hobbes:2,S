indeed, well spotted!
This construct was indeed an abuse of the per_cpu facilities.
Note that beyond the obvious memory savings, your patch should make the 
code a bit faster and a bit smaller as well in the SMP TLB flush codepath: 
the smp_flush_state data structure is 64 (or 128) bytes so static array 
arithmetics will be faster than the per_cpu indirection.
I have applied your patch to tip/x86/mm, thanks Frederik!
