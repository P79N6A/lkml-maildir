  Hi, all. Version 2 of my msr patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
Some documentation is also available here.
The patch provides user space access to Model-Specific Registers (MSRs)
and Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) via device driver interfaces.
This is against 2.2.0-pre9+devfs. Highlights of this release:
- Removed the MTRR-specific IPI handler and replaced with a generic
  function call IPI. Running a function on a remote CPU is now easy
- Modified the MTRR code to make use of this new facility
- Added SMP support for the MSR and PMC drivers
				Regards,
					Richard....
