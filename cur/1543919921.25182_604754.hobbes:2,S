These declarations are extern, but
pm-rework-struct-platform_suspend_ops.patch makes the function
definitions static, which doesn't seem to be allowed.
After removing the static bits from those two functions in
mpc52xx_pm.c it builds, but there are lots of warnings, which seem to
be related:

The build is moving though, and I don't actually have this platform --
I just can't avoid building it when building for powermac.  Thanks.
