I have fixed the stale header cache problem. Files are statted on every
request, no "practical" tricks.
Performance doesn't seem to have suffered :)
I also have added a cache garbage collector to close "old" file descriptors
and remove even older header cache entries. This should make sure that you
don't exceed your system resources. The definition of old and the sweep
frequency are user configurable.
You can download the new version
