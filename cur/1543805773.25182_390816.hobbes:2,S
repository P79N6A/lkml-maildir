That seemed to clear the error message, and my 1.1 devices at least, still work 
fine.  Perhaps the error message could be changed to point users in the right 
direction to fixing this, perhaps something more like "0000:00:1d.7 EHCI: BIOS 
handoff failed (BIOS bug?  Try disabling legacy USB support in BIOS if it is 
enabled)"
Anyway, thanks for the hint (and sorry for the noise).
