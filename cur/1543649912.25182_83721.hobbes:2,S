Posted to Linux-Kernel since it's still a valid ALi 15XX driver problem.

Yes; I have everything working on this laptop (with maybe the exception of
  the lid-close switch, which somehow causes the laptop to crash or simply
  not suspend properly.).
What I did was create (with Toshiba's/Phoenix's hibernation partition
  creation utility; I forget what it's called and where I got it; if you
  find it, please tell me so I can archive off a copy of it for later. :)
  a suspend partition for the BIOS.  I set the laptop to suspend to disk
  (otherwise, suspending to RAM causes the processor to overheat (I
  highly suspect a BIOS bug, but, natch, Linux is unsupported so they
  won't look into it.  *sigh*)).
The critical point is to *disable* ALi 15xx IDE support.  Otherwise,
  the laptop suspends everything but "extended" memory and simply hangs
  at the start of saving off that data.
You can get around using PIO mode by creating one ALi kernel, booting
  into it to activate DMA, then rebooting into a non-ALi (generic IDE
  drivers) kernel so that you can suspend to disk.  It's an annoying
  workaround, though, and I'd like to finally have BIOS and the ALi
  drivers play nice.
I look forward to the software suspend coming up, since I can then not
  have to rely on a gronky, highly proprietary (so far as I can tell)
  BIOS.

 only know about one browser released in the last two years that violates
