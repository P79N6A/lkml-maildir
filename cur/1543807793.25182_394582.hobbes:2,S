Sure.
I think it is more an accident of time, and the fact that I am quite
proud of where I am at.  You quite likely have improved things in openvz
since last I looked as well.  Currently my code quality is only a proof
of concept but the tree is below.
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/linux-2.6-ns.git/
Basically the implementation appears to the user as a separate instance
of the network stack.  Since the tree was experimental the path is
absolutely horrible.  I am in the process of cleaning and redoing all
of that now in preparation for kernel inclusion.
But I suspect I am in the lead as no one else had noticed the ipv6 
reference counting bugs.

Above.  But at least with pids it has all been posted on the mailing list.
I think I have solved most of the code structural issues and the big
kernel API issues.  A lot of the little things I have not gotten to yet
as I figured it was best approached later.

Sorry in/out in this context I was referring to the stock linux kernel.
As soon as I had a viable proof of concept I began working to get
my code merged.
