I've extracted this list from a table which includes a pid cache column.
this pid cache column is not complete yet. I'd be nice if we could use a
wiki to maintain this table, the existing openvz or vserver wiki ?

ok we need to add this one.

got that also.

sure :) some drivers are for some exotic piece of hardware that are not
currently found on a standard server.

ok thanks, will update.

yes yes. hard stuff though which requires time.

we would need a wiki to maintain the work in progress on that topic while
we work on the pidspace.
another list to maintain would be the pid_t to struct pid replacement.
