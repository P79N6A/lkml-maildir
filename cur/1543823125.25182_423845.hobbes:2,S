Is this check now needed given we have the zone alignment patches in
this -mm also?  I think we want to make it at least possible to
boot such a kernel on a 'flat' machine.

x86 NUMA panic compile error
Seem we have a syntax error rising from the the new panic added
to let people know NUMA didn't work on physically non-numa hardware.
