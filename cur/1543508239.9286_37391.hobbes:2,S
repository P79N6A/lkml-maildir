Hi all,
I'm running 2.3.16 on a Dual Pentium Box and got the following in my
syslog today:
Sep  4 20:11:40 tony kernel: iput: Aieee, semaphore in use inode 00:00/5105, count=2
Sep  4 20:11:40 tony kernel: iput: Aieee, semaphore in use inode 00:00/5092, count=2
Sep  4 20:11:40 tony kernel: iput: Aieee, semaphore in use inode 00:00/5050, count=2
Sep  4 20:11:40 tony kernel: iput: Aieee, semaphore in use inode 00:00/5029, count=2
Sep  4 20:11:40 tony kernel: iput: Aieee, semaphore in use inode 00:00/4996, count=2
Sep  4 20:11:40 tony kernel: iput: Aieee, semaphore in use inode 00:00/5107, count=2
Sep  4 20:11:40 tony kernel: iput: Aieee, semaphore in use inode 00:00/5095, count=2
As you can see these messages were appearing at the same time, but I
can't reconstruct what was running at that time. I hope someone can
tell me what is going on ...
cheers,
Patrick
