Hi all!
I'm trying to set up a raid array using two Maxtor DMaxPlus 6Y080M0
Sata, kernel 2.4.25 with libata 2.4.25-16 including support for Sis 964
chipset by Uwe Koziolek / Jeff Garzik.
Although Bios recognizes the disks during the post, the kernel doesn't
see them and gives out this message:
SCSI subsystem driver Revision: 1.00
libata version 1.02 loaded.
PCI: Found IRQ 10 for device 00:05.0
ata1: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xEFF0 ctl 0xEFE6 bmdma 0xEF90 irq 10
ata2: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xEFA8 ctl 0xEFE2 bmdma 0xEF98 irq 10
ata1: no device found (phy stat 5dfdfffe)
ata1: thread exiting
i8253 count too high! resetting..
ata2: no device found (phy stat 0094108a)
ata2: thread exiting
scsi0 : sata_sis
scsi1 : sata_sis
i8253 count too high! resetting..
Could it be a problem with the libata patch? Any suggestions?
Thank you.
Elisa
