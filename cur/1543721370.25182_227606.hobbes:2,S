I just booted 2.6.7, and eth1 came up in 100Mbit mode as happened with
-mm, and packet loss ensued.  I think maybe that the switch is only
allowing 1000Mbit operation.  I rebooted into single user mode to
restore the old kernel, but the second time eth1 came up at 1000Mbit so
the networking works now.  The serial console is no better than before,
but not completely broken like in -mm.
I'll leave 2.6.7 running today and see how it does.
