I would much rather have hex data. It makes all the parsing tools
connected to the serial port that much easier. If instead of hacking the
kernel you bang out a little bit of expect you can do it all on the host
driving the embedded box, and find the file names, and open them in an
editor at the right function, and do a parallel lookup in bugzilla for
matching oops logs...
