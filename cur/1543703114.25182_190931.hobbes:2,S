Subject: Re: [SPAM?] [PATCH] Backport via-ircc to Linux-2.4 from 2.6

Hi,
look, I do not have much time for this political discussion.
All I say is:
- I backported the VIA FIR IRDA driver from 2.6 because I needed it
- Most other AMD-based laptop users will need it too
- The driver (or at least a close relative) worked flawlessly for me for 1 year
- The backport does not affect other drivers or system stability even when loaded
- I am willing to maintain it till 2.4 is phased out. Which is the case when
  distros decide to go 2.6, but no earlier.
Here is the patch, take it or leave it or start talking CODE.
