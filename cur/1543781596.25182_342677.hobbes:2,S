That's a good one to try (and if it matters, can you please do a full 
"lspci -vvx" for before-and-after? In fact, it would probably be good to 
do that _regardless_ - do it with an old known-good kernel, and with one 
recent kernel).
At the same time, something struck me. Does it happen to be much warmer in 
your room lately? As in due to a heatwave? I'm just wondering if it might 
be something as silly as a thermal shutdown.
