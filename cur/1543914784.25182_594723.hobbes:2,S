I recognize it's a rhetorical question :)  The answer is of course "no".
I hope the other participants of this thread register the severe 
disinclination of the maintainers to change this stuff, as this is a 
classic case of making a mountain out of a molehill[1].
For the -vast majority- of people configuring the kernel, this is not a 
problem.  Kernel people are -expected- to know what they're doing, 
especially when switching from one major subsystem to another.
Therefore, all this is IMO wasted effort and hot air.  There are far 
more important issues to deal with.
