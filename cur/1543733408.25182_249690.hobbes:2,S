Most IMPORTANT is that some-one some-where there is a list of ALL of
these.  These are best in the form of code comments so the the respective
places in the code can be changed.

I'd love to, where do I start?  The problem he is that I have no-idea...
1. What values I'd neet to test for and sort.
2. The order of the sorting(probly documented in DRI-client code).
3. Where in the DRM I can proform the needed test and sort.
I would also love a list of ALL of these so I can fix them one by one.  A
good project for a new DRI developer, no.
