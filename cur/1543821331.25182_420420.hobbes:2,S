Is there an official position on "typedef unsigned __bitwise__ myflags_t"? 
That is, getting into case (c) with something not particularly useful for 
typechecking, just because you want to use a typedef. 
I don't remember if the gfp_t thing was only done because it would catch a 
very common type of bug, or if it's generally suggested for new code.
