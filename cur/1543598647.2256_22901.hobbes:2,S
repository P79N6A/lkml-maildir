  Hi, all. Version 189 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
Patch directly available from:
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rgooch/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
AND:
ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/linux/kernel-patches/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
This is against 2.4.9. Highlights of this release:
- Removed nlink field from struct devfs_inode
- Removed auto-ownership for /dev/pty/* (BSD ptys) and used
  DEVFS_FL_CURRENT_OWNER|DEVFS_FL_NO_PERSISTENCE for /dev/pty/s* (just
  like Unix98 pty slaves) and made /dev/pty/m* rw-rw-rw- access
				Regards,
					Richard....
