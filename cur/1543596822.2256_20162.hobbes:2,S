Also, additional memory on an ix86, as specified, can only be accessed
via page registers (like the old DOS himem.sys). This is because
the Intel machines have 32 bits of address-space. That's around
4 GB, not 64 GB. So, if you intend to do conventional, user-space
programming,i (like using malloc) you will not be able to get anything
like 4 GB.

    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
