this appears to be a bug in the acpi code, to be exact in
processor_throttling.c file, function
acpi_processor_set_throttling_ptc(); it disables interrupts and then
appears to do a cross-cpu IPI to set the state. Well... we can't do
that due to deadlock reasons (you can't do IPI's with interrupts off or
you can get a very nice deadlock with the cpu that you IPI trying to
do the same thing to you).
