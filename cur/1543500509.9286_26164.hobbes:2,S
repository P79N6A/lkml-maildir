No, sorry, you are right, (I was thinking too much about my tree), the
pre-2.3.9-3 shrink_mmap is safe because both truncate_inode_pages and
shrink_mmap runs with the big kernel lock held. Correct. (it was a my
local problem where shrink_mmap runs without the big kernel lock)
Thinking about my problem I am not sure if I really need to grab the
pagecache_lock in shrink_mmap only to stay synchronized with the
page-count of the page to avoid racing with truncate_inode_pages. My
shrink_mmap has all its locking based on the per-page PG_locked bitflag
and on a separate spinlock that I use only to synchronize the pagemap-lru
list management. So it looks to me that the check of page->inode in
truncate_inode_pages() is the right thing to do in my case. Do you think
there are many other places that may get confused by my logic as
truncate_inode_pages was (so I could fix them too)? The page->inode can't
change while the page is locked down so if I check the page->inode after I
have the page locked, then I can avoid in shrink_mmap to check the
page_count of the page with the pagemap_lock held (so I can really
SMP-thread shrink_mmap in respect of everything else as I am doing now).
