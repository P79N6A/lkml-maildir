i do not know if i act like a troll - i think a troll is something 
totally different.
yes of course i know xfs or e.g. the kernel version named debate. but - 
seriously - is it worth spending
so many time to discuss instead of just fixing the code meanwhile?
that is the main problem also in some other open source projects.
discussing instead of developing - not really efficient.
ps. FYI no, i am not a troll, and i am also taking part in some open 
source projects contributing code.
