This fixed the build problems for me (SMP). I did get one unresolved 
symbol when building this with REALTIME enabled. Also got error messages 
scrolling up the screen when I tried to boot it (looked very much like 
Mark's problem with T4) and it never made it. :( If I had to guess, it 
might be related to APICs? I always have to use "noapic" boot parameter. 
Ingo what are you running this on? I don't have the exact error 
messages, but I'm rebuilding it now to try to get those. Without RT 
Preemption it seems to be running very nicely.
