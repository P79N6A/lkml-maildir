Yes, you would. Someone mentioned on usb-storage list that Windows supports
two things only without extra drivers: Transparent SCSI over Bulk, and UFI.
IIRC, it was Pat. So, I thought maybe to tackle drivers/block/ufi.c later,
to share design concept and some libraries with ub. The rest stays with
usb-storage. But the real life always introduces corrections to plans, so
let's not get too far ahead.
