My idea is to keep the current slot concept, but instead of having kvm
allocate pages for a slot, it would call get_user_pages() for a virtual
address range.  Userspace doesn't directly talk about vmas, just virtual
address ranges.

No question that it is hard.  I'd like to explore just how hard it is.
