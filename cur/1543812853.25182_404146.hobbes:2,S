Both boot logs contains the Cannot messages.
The "bad" log also contains:
Mar  7 10:58:41 deneb kernel: PCI: Failed to allocate mem resource #6:20000@48000000 for 0000:01:00.0
Is device 0:01:00.0 your Nvidia video card?
Is there an updated NVRM driver for it (guessing from your OK boot log)
for 2.6.15 or later?
I suppose an lspci might help.  I dunno.
