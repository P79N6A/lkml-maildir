E.g. Linux. Very undocumented, but has been around for ages ('92 or
such). The main purpose is to keep the floppy drive from spinning up
to check for a media change when you open it to access parameters and
such. E.g. fdformat, setfdprm, and LILO use this. (NB: some versions
of strace print the flags argument in this case as "0x4", although
it's really 3.)
