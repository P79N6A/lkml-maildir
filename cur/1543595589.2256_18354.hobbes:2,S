Wouldn't the existing close() be good enough for that?

Actually, this is exactly what you do want to happen. Linux's existing 
signals + threads semantics are not exactly ideal for high-performance 
computing. Of course, fd's are shared by all threads, so all of the threads 
would be able to read the siginfo structures into memory.

If I understood Dan's intentions correctly, you could use signal() and 
sigaction(), but while the fd is open, signals would be queued up to the fd 
rather than passed off to a signal handler or sigwaitinfo(). Care to 
comment  Dan?

Maybe we can both hack on this.
