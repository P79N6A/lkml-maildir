First, sorry for yelling earlier. I'm conscious of problems with PC

aware of this as well - too much overhead for not so much. But a
newbie is not as stupid to eject a floppy when he sees the LED is on
(well, at least I hope so :)

I don't want Linux to thrash floppies... The media thrashes itself
more easily than Linux does... And I know that the MS_SYNCHRONOUS
option only works for ext2 for now, whereas most floppies are FAT...
The big problem is that mounting/unmounting is not possible if the
mount point is currently being busy. With the current VFS
implementation, the superblock pointer in a dentry cannot be changed
if the dentry is in use. So yes, you're right, it requires that half,
if not more, of the VFS be rewritten :( I'll have a deeper look at all
this to identify all possible problems.
kfm has no problem with automount (unlike MC) because it reads a
directory but does not chdir() to it, so yes, kfm, unlike MC, will
allow the "click icon/remove media (after timeout)/click refresh"
cycle. But kfm is only one application among thousands.
