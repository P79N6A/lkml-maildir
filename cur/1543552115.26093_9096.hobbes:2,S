Yes, that is _exactly_ the point.

The page count of the mapped pages should be ok, it seems those mapped pages
have a reference count of 1 just from the vmalloc allocation and they use
PG_reserved just to skip swap_out, but I feel safer too if the bttv maintainers
will check it and send it to you themself after checking it's correct. (I only
verified that it was compiling correctly)
Thanks.
