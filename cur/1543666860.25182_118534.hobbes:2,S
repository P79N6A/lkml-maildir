It is a convinient feature that I can download the kernel now and then
when at work (no linux) - and it makes it a bit simpler to use
an archiver that has native support for the format used.
Winzip, being the only allowed archiver at work, does not
have native bz2 support.
I have a .bz2 commandline version on the windoze machine so I will cope,
but mainly to let you know that deprecating .gz you will make it
difficult for a minority to read the kernel src.
