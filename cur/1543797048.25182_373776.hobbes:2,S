yeah. 'struct timer' and 'struct timeout' is even better. I tried it on 
real code and sometimes it looked a bit funny: often we have a 'timeout' 
parameter somewhere that is a scalar or a timeval/timespec. So at least 
for variable names it was useful to have it in this form:
	struct timeout *ktimeout;
	struct timer *ktimer;
otherwise it looked OK. This is also in line with most other 'object 
names' we have in the kernel: struct inode, struct dentry.
