Yes, and __rcu_pending() sees the old value of ->cur.
IOW. Suppose that this CPU reads rcp->cur out of order. To simplify, let's
suppose that stop_hz_timer() on CPU_0 in fact does
	xxx = rcu_needs_cpu(cpu); // false
	// ---- WINDOW ------
	cpu_set(cpu, nohz_cpu_mask);
	if (xxx || local_softirq_pending()) {
		... abort ...
	}
	...proceed...
Another CPU does rcu_start_batch() in the window above. In that case
rcp->cpumask will include CPU_0, and the grace period can't be completed
untill CPU_0 is "woken".
