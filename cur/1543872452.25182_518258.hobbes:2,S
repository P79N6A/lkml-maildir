OTOH, if i would write it this way
#define BALIGN(x,bits)      ((((x) >> (bits)) + 1) << (bits))
that would give more convenient way of expessing alignment (values of
what are most widely used, i.e powers of two) without log2(:)
requirement, no?
arch/powerpc/mm/hugetlbpage.c:                  addr = ALIGN(addr+1,1UL<<HTLB_AREA_SHIFT);
arch/powerpc/mm/hugetlbpage.c:                  addr = ALIGN(addr+1,1<<SID_SHIFT);
But it's not conventional, of course, and name is ugly.
