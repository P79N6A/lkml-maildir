nah. And the fact that i could boot this on a non-NUMA box already 
unearthed a weakness in the buddy allocator. (it should have much 
clearer asserts about mis-sized zones - it's not the first time we had 
them and they are hard to debug) So consider this a debugging feature. 
It also found other bugs, so even if nobody but me uses it, it's useful.
