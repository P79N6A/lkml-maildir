Subject: xmms (audio) skipping in 2.5 (not 2.4)

OK, so I finally took the plunge, and put 2.5 on my main desktop as well as
just the lab machines ;-)
Generally seems to work very well, and VM performance is much more stable
than 2.4 ... but xmms seems to skip if I just waggle the scrollbar in some
windows. This happens most in my email client (which is Mulberry), but
other things show it to a more limited extent.
The audio pauses happen on a simple window scroll down, without intensive
CPU background activity ... they're very short in duration, which makes it
*feel* more like the audio buffer is too small than a scheduler problem,
but I'm just guessing really.
So ... is there any easy way I can diagnose this? Does anyone else have a
similar problem?
Audio is SiS SI7012 ALSA driver emulating OSS. Athalon 2100, 512Mb.
kernel = 2.5.63-mjb2

PS. In the unlikely even that anyone's particularly fascinated by one app,
Mulberry isn't free, but a free demo can be downloaded from
http://www.cyrusoft.com
 if you wade through the registration ... as I say,
unlikely ;-)
