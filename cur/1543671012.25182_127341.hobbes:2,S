That may be simple for you, but for lots of users, adding a partition
(to a ususally full disk drive) isn't simple.  It means backups,
shrink a filesystem, shrink a partition, add a partition, and run
mkswap on it.   Yes, the latter 2 are simple, but the former ones
are not.
Oh, and then just start over and install everything from backups. :(
