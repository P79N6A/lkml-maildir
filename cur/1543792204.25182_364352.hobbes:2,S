How do you ever know that new change introduced no new bugs?  Maybe 
there was a latent race condition that is activated by timing 
differences caused by the new code.  Maybe it shifts the spacing of the 
code just enough to get hit by a pre-existing trampler.  Unless you test 
it, you *can't* know.
The safe bet is to simply rename the final -rc with no further changes.
