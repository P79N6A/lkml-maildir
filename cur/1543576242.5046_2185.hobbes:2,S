Yes, rtl8139, emu10k are loaded and working fine.

Yes, after the patch, it was, as always:
make clean
make menuconfig
make dep bzlilo modules modules_install
Same problem with 2.4.0-test13-pre3-ac1 on
my Linux workstation at the office, where the
token ring driver fails as well (olympic.o)
BTW, in my experience to date with kernels from
2.3.36 up to  2.4.0-test-12 it has all worked well.
