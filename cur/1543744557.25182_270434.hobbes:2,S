If you're going to use sysfs, libsysfs can help. It can be found in the
sysfsutils package here:
http://linux-diag.sourceforge.net/Sysfsutils.html
[stekloff@... stekloff]$ systool -c net eth0 -D
Class = "net"
  Class Device = "eth0"
    Device = "0000:02:01.0"
    Driver = "e1000"
      Devices using "e1000" are:
        Device = "0000:02:01.0"
And more extended output:
