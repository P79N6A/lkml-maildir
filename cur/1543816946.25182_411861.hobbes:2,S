Question on unlock_page:
void fastcall unlock_page(struct page *page)
{
        smp_mb__before_clear_bit();
        if (!TestClearPageLocked(page))
                BUG();
        smp_mb__after_clear_bit();
        wake_up_page(page, PG_locked);
}
Assuming test_and_clear_bit() on all arch does what the API is
called for with full memory fence around the atomic op, why do
you need smp_mb__before_clear_bit and smp_mb__after_clear_bit?
Aren't they redundant?
