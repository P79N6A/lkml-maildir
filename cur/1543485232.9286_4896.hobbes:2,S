Except in NTFS (I think), where clea{r,n}ing an inode frees up some memory
allocated specifically by the file system.
I notice Alexander Viro wrote also:

So it might be the same also for ext2.
If this is the case I see two options -
	i) call free_inode_memory() from try_to_free_pages(), or
	ii) create a list of 'create free memory' routines that try_to_free_pages()
	can call; filesystems / other things can call routines to register /
	unregister create free memory functions.
