Subject: [PATCH 05/10] Blackfin SPI driver: prevent people from setting bits in ctl_reg
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/11/371

From: Mike Frysinger <michael.frysinger@analog.com>
Prevent people from setting bits in ctl_reg that the SPI
framework already handles, hopefully we can one day drop
ctl_reg completely
