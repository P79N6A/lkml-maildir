This would be distinct from 'shutdown -r' how?  Is there a reason you
want to "completely" restart userland and *not* reboot (for instance,
wanting to keep existing mounts, etc)?
A case could be made that for a "complete" restart, you need to trash
those mounts too (if you're restarting to get a 'clean' setup, you want
to actually be clean), and so forth.
