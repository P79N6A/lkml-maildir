Read the kernel.  Notifiers are called from all sorts of hot paths, so they 
damned well better be light.

Given that the overhead need not be present at all, neither.

Easy: in register_notifier stuff a serial number for each entry put on 
a notifier chain.  Remember the serial number of the entry before performing 
->notifier_call in notifier_call_chain.  Upon return, if the chain has been 
modified (easy to detect by nature of the serial number changing), walk 
the chain looking for the entry following the last serial number run.  Voila, 
rcu can be used to protect the chain's contents.
