I didn't actually check system and user times for the mysql
benchmark, but that's exactly what I had in mind when I
mentioned the poor cache behaviour this patch could cause. I
definitely did see user times go up in benchmarks where I
measured.
We have percpu and cache affine page allocators, so when
userspace just frees a page, it is likely to be cache hot, so
we want to free it up so it can be reused by this CPU ASAP.
Likewise, when we newly allocate a page, we want it to be one
that is cache hot on this CPU.

I'll let you and Ulrich decide on that. Keep in mind that older
kernels (without the mmap_sem patch for MADV_DONTNEED) still
seem to get a pretty decent improvement from using MADV_DONTNEED,
so it is possible glibc will want to start using that anyway.
