The useful bits are here:
http://kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/bcollins/ubuntu-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=14351f8e573442e2437d4b177fa10075aaefd5c9;hp=4f1d774aadfc5a6ed1545dca180f66ab6d0f543d
The author of the patch that you are submitting confirmed that a new
patch works for him and suggested that it should be used instead of
the original patch (because it conflicts with sata_sis driver as it claims
