chris - for example, i notice that at the top of ipt_owner.c it says
"deals with local outgoing sockets".
so... does sk_buff _only_ contain a list of outgoing sockets?
iiiisss... there a different socket for incoming traffic that
someone is different from the list of sockets associated with
a task?
is the clue in what you say about "Incoming is in interrupt context"?
are the sockets in the interrupt context somehow different / special
such that they would never get to this code?
gloop, gloop, i'm drowning in lack of knowledge, here.
