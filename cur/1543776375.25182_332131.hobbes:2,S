Puzzling. None of these patches should affect your setup.
And you still have DMA timeouts...

The only difference is that under 2.6.13-rc2 the cardbus ranges
are a lot bigger. With the patch here your PCI setup should be
identical to 2.6.12. I don't think this fixes DMA problem,
but just to be sure...
