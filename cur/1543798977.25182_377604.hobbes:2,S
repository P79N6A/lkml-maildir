For writes only 40% of the ram can be "dirty".

I believe there is a way to change it, I am pretty sure that it has
been discussed on the kernel list a couple of months ago, I 
don't remember exactly what the change is, and I think the change
was more complicated that was obvious.
The previous subject on a similar thing was:
"kernel 2.6.13 buffer strangeness"
