i'm interested in having the system work for the Blackfin port and
that's it.  if people want to redefine the current standard of how
u-boot images are generated, then go for it and get the approval of
all the existing arches.
there's a difference between NACKing my changes because the patch
breaks things versus because you think the whole system should be
taking some other form.
so if you dont like the mkuboot.sh script, fine, have at it with
rewriting the system ... otherwise the patch i proposed should
continue on for inclusion.
