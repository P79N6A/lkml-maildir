When I did the port randomization patch the benchmark that was most impacted
was LMBENCH.  The biggest change was in the communications latency results.
If you want, you can sign up for a free access to OSDL test machines
and use STP to run lmbench and easily get before/after results.
1. Go to osdl.org and get associate account

2. Submit patch to Patch Lifecycle Manager 
http://osdl.org/plm-cgi/plm
3. Choose test to run Scalable Test Platform (STP)
