Hi,
This week i posted a report of fs corruption in 2.2.12. People asked me
if i also got the error with the 2.2.13pre patches. I switched to
2.2.13 yesterday and the fs corruption is reoccuring.
This is what i get now:
Oct 21 23:13:04 news2 kernel: EXT2-fs error (device md(9,3)):
ext2_add_entry: bad entry in directory #10022921: directory entry across
blocks - offset=7152, inode=843004500, rec_len=17248, name_len=45
