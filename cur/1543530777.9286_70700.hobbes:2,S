It's a bit late to do that now :-)
Basically, we are presented with a fait accompli: At least one process
dies. Which one? The most appropriate answer in most cases is "the
biggest" (with a few modifications to favour killing newly started
processes etc.)

Not significantly, IMO; allocating memory on use rather than on
request is just an optimisation. (It allows much simpler code in many
cases; you can just malloc() a sparse array safely, for example.)

Not really; remember, the stack is also demand-allocated.

There are some specialist applications where you may want/need this
fine-grained control over your app's memory usage and stack size - but
the main Linux kernel is not the right place for this, IMO.
