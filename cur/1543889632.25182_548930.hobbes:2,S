In fact the device wasn't generating a stream of interrupts when loaded
(i guess). It was just that the shared handler was showing all the
interrupts that occurred, since i was not looking at the interrupt
mask/status.
But accessing any registers caused me a flood of interrupts, which froze
the system. excessive printing to the console caused a lockup.
I am now wondering whether the usage of MSI would help in this case and
that i should be using enable_msi before request_irq ?
