Subject: Early SPECWeb99 results on 2.5.33 with TSO on e1000

  I've got some early SPECWeb [*] results with 2.5.33 and TSO on e1000.  I
get 2906 simultaneous connections, 99.2% conforming (i.e. faster than the
320 kbps cutoff), at 0% idle with TSO on.  For comparison, with 2.5.25, I 
got 2656, and with 2.5.29 I got 2662, (both 99+% conformance and 0% idle) so
TSO and 2.5.33 look like a Big Win.
  I'm having trouble testing with TSO off (I changed the #define NETIF_F_TSO
to "0" in include/linux/netdevice.h to turn it off).  I am getting errors.
     NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out
     e1000: eth1 NIC Link is Up 1000 Mbps Full Duplex
  That's pushed my SPECWeb results down to below 2500 connections with TSO 
off because of those adapter resets (It is only that one adapter, BTW) and
these results (with TSO off) shouldn't be considered valid.
  eth1 is the only adapter with errors, and they all look like RX overruns.
For comparison:

  I'm still working on getting a clean run with TSO off.  If anyone has any
ideas for me about the timeout errors, I'd appreciate the clue.
Thanks,
