You have to ignore the partition table contents for ending cylinder. Use 
the following instead. You also
have to write your own FS or modify the partition code in Linux or you 
won't be able to use the storage. This
config option listed in the previous post only enables 64 bit LBA 
addressing, it does not fix the busted fdisk program
or the problems you will see with the partition tables.
i.e.
SystemDisk[j]->BytesPerSector = bdev_hardsect_size(bdev);
SystemDisk[j]->driveSectors = (LONGLONG)bdev->bd_disk->capacity;
SystemDisk[j]->driveSize = (LONGLONG)
((LONGLONG)bdev->bd_disk->capacity *
SystemDisk[j]->BytesPerSector);
SystemDisk[j]->max_sg_elements = bio_get_nr_vecs(bdev);
the bd_disk->capacity reports the actual drive size, but fdisk ignores it.
Good Luck.
