Hello,
I have implemented mmap with (nopage), the mmaping consists of normal
memory from __get_free_pages (set to RESERVED) and some registers/memory
that are on a PCI card (bar0), i mapped it with ioremap_nocache to to be
able to read and write it in kernelspace.
I tried to use virt_to_page(address_from_ioremap_nocache + some_offset)
and gave this back from the (nopage) function, but this leads to an
Oops. (with the other memory it works)
Where is here my error?
Regards
Christian Leber
