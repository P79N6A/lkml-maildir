Subject: [Patch][RFC][RFT] Get consistent disk paging data with /proc/stat
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

[RFT]: Request for testers :-)
Hallo,
at present /proc/stat reports in the "page" line the number of calls
made to make_request. As the number of 512 bytes records belonging to one
request varies ( 2 for a normal harddisk, 4 for a SCSI CDROM,
probably 8 for a md-device), this accumulated number doesn't reflect a 
real hard number tranfered to and from the media. I propose counting
the number of records instead. This would require a change to xosview, 
or otherwise the numbers for normal disk accesses would off by a
factor of two.
Any objections
Bye
