Hi!
If some interrupt has non-zero count, I think that it is worth
displaying even if there's no current user. If you want to know how
many interrupts from serial happened, you  can do that now without cat
/dev/ttyS1... You'll also clearly see what interrupts are in use on
your system and what are not...
