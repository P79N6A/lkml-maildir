Which is _wrong_. If you omit the 'nolock' mount option, then the client
_does_ use NLM locking, and so will need the RPC downcall.
If you don't need NLM locking, and want to make sure nobody else can
enable it, then you can triviall 'fix' this on your server by patching
it to force the nolock mount option. This isn't a patch that we
particularly want to see in mainline, though.
