If you're running 2.4.0-test12-pre5 or later with reiserfs, you should be 
aware that this can be unsafe due to a problem with reiserfs_writepage.
Fortunately, Chris Mason just posted a patch to fix this on the reiserfs-list,
against reiserfs-3.6.22.  The recent reiserfs-list archives can be found at:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=reiserfs&r=1&w=2&b=200012
This may have nothing to do with your oops, but if you're going to run
2.4.0-test12-pre5,6,7 then go get the writepage.diff patch, and apply it
after applying linux-2.4.0-test10-reiserfs-3.6.22-patch.
Of course, this is bleeding edge, so the usual caveats apply.
Good luck,
Steven
