This is normal. 2.4.17 does not support i830MP.

This is much stranger... And even if the 830mp stuff does not work 
(several people have been able to use it), loading the agpgart module 
with the 'try_unsupported=1' option should do the trick (at least in 
2.4.18-pre7)... Can you send the full output of lspci ?
Best regards.
