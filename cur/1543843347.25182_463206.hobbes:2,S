At the suggestion of Venki, I opened a bugzilla ticket on it:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7157
And the lowdown is that it seems the newer BIOS no longer exports the
correct ACPI symbols which are required for speedstep, thus no longer
supporting it (at least via the official methods). Hence it seems not a
Linux kernel bug.
I opened a support ticket with HP, hopefully they address the issue. In
the meantime I rolled back my bios and have cpufreq working again.
Interesting that you also see the problem on an nc6320, it could be that
they use the same BIOS codebase for various models.
