   Ugh.
   I'd much rather just always add it to the "inode dirty list". List
   maintenance is essentially zero overhead if you use the nice list macros
   in <linux/list.h> (as opposed to the braindamaged BSD compatibility macros
   in <linux/lists.h>), and it's fairly trivial to just keep each dirty block
   on two dirty lists (one inode-specific, one global - you'd still use the
   global one for normal write-outs). 
This works for ext2, but it doesn't work with filesystems (most notably
FAT filesystems, and possibly some B-tree based filesystems) where
metadata might be shared by multiple files, so a block might have to be
on multiple inode dirty lists.  I had thought about using a linked list
architecture and threading buffer_head structures onto inode dirty
linked lists, but I discarded that plan since it wouldn't work for all
filesystems.
