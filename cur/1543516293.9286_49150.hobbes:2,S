Last time I had this, it was a dodgy IDE cable connection. Reseating the
cables caused the problem to go away (around a year and a half ago). And,
yes, if it wasn't for Ted's programs (and having the source code to fix a
very obscure problem in the superblocks) a small British TV company would
have lost an awful lot of its graphics. Thankfully, I wasn't responsible for
the (lack of) backups at the time.
