Has it?  I don't think I've ever observed any benefits from it and I don't
think anyone has ever got down and worked out what its drawbacks might be,
and seen if they can be demonstrated in practice.
I also have vague memories of some serious-sounding review comments about
the code from Nick.

I'm waiting to be shown that its benefits exceed its costs.  Sometimes
that's hard.
