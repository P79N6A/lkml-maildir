Hi,
This is included with the patch set I just posted, 2.4.22-uv3 available at
http://www.hardrock.org/current-updates/linux-2.4.22-uv3-updates.patch.
This also includes patches for some other issues in 2.4.22.  I haven't yet
posted one for 2.4.23 due to some outstanding issues with what appear to be
(or at least could be) hard locks (such as this thread).  Once these are
resolved I will be releasing a -uv for 2.4.23.
Regards
James
