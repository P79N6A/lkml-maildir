Hmm.  BK has a sort of lame checksum that it uses for integrity and we
used to see checksum failures frequently until I stopped buying memory
without ECC.  This same lame checksum was what found the cache aliasing
bug in SPARC/Linux.  
At any rate, I have been using 2.2.15-pre9 for months without any errors
so are you sure that it is buffer cache corruption and not bad memory
dimms?  If you are sure, I want to know.
