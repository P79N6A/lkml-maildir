It needs at least one new preliminary patch (to add on_cpu_single);
please get the series from 
ftp://ftp.firstfloor.org/pub/ak/x86_64/quilt/patches-2.6.22-rc2-git7-070525-1.tar.gz
You need at least tsc-unstable upto paravirt-add-a-sched_clock-paravirt
for everything

Unfortunately right now it is a already a set of patches; e.g. due to 
the paravirt ops change. I can merge back the cleanup change; but
kept it separately due to your earlier complaint about not using
your patch. I think one hunk of your original one is still in there :-)

You're reading too much into that. Of course I value contributions
to x86-64, including cleanups. In general when I don't like it I complain
so saying nothing is approval (or me being not reading email, but that
doesn't happen that often)
