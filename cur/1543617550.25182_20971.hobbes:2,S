I agree that this will not make things simpler, it will just streamline
and speed up some of the VM paths for people who just don't need it.
A lot of HIGHMEM users have just 1GB and use HIGHMEM to get at the last
few megs, so..
It might make sense to make it an independent config option, and possibly
just split up the highmem question a bit more (ie make the choices be
something like "none", "4G", "4G+pte-kmap" or "64G(with pte-kmap)").
