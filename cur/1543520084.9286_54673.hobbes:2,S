Wait.. There was some reason this couldn't happen, we had this discussion
with Dave some time ago. Let's see..
[ think think think ]
Ok: in order to write() from the page, the page must have been paged in.
That page-in() will make sure that the page is first _read_. And that read
code does not care about the page lock, it only cares about the uptodate
bit.  So it's ok to write from a locked page into a locked page, as long
as that page is marked up-to-date, because the page-in case won't care
about the lock.
So the solution comes down from verifying that the page is marked
up-to-date _before_ it is accessed and locked for the write. Which
automatically happens if the page is just marked up-to-date before we do
the "copy_from_user()" (at any time before that we don't care).
Ok, I think that was the solution I remember, but it's obviously broken.
It leaves a window of non-updated page contents that can be read. Ho
humm.. Your suggestion may be the way to go.
