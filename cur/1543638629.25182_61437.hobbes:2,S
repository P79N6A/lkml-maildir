I actually forced it to UDMA 44 as there were issues with the IBM drive
and the highpoint controller at one time (they may have been resolved
now but I have no need to increase to 66 - and wonder if in fact there
is any benefit in doing so, anyway).
Alan - I'm wondering if this issue is related to Maxtor drives? All the
reports I have seen of this problem have featured drives from this
manufacturer.
