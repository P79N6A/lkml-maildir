I phrased that poorly. Thanks for bringing it to my attention so I can try
again. Linux has been evolving from an OS suitable for hobbyists to one of
the most stable production-quality OSes available. I'm just pointing out
what I see as an obstacle looming on this evolutionary path.

I agree that having to deal with old patches is bad, but it is a known
risk in using non-standard patches, even if they are widely used. Because
the RAID code changed in a way that was not backwards-compatible, a choice
must be made between breaking a standard kernel feature in a stable kernel
and leaving people using the currently non-standard (from a kernel
perspective) feature with the hassle of patch incompatibilities. Both
options are bad. Getting a stable 2.4 out with the new RAID code solves
both problems.
If Alan and Linus were to go along with my suggestion and accept only bug
fixes into 2.2, there might be fewer 2.2.x releases to trip you up, and
each one would have less code changed so the old patches would be more
likely to work.

I think this is a good suggestion, though I'd rather see the effort go
into getting these features into 2.3, getting 2.3 frozen, then
stabilized, and released as 2.4.
