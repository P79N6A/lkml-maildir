   These two are both reported by me, are the same issue.  The exact
   same kernel, one with PIIXn tuning enabled, will hang the hardware on
   boot requiring a physical power loss to restart.
Ah, OK, thanks.  I've collapsed the two bug reports.  (The first one was
added by Alan, and his lists didn't give any indication as to two
reported the problem, so I didn't realize they were the same problem.)
