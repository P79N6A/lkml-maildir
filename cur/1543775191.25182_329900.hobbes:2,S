PA-RISC must have been doing this before somehow.
All PARISC boxen with PAT PDC firmware (A500/N- and L-Class) 
have to deal with unconfigured PCI Bus devices at boot time.
But I also have to confess I know PCI-PCI Bridge support is broken
on those boxes for the past year... /o\
(system will hard fail/crash if a PCI-PCI Bridge is installed)
Normal add-on PCI cards get configured properly AFAICT. 
"Card-mode" Dino boxen also have to deal with unconfigured PCI devices.
Just PCI-PCI bridges are never below a card-mode Dino.
(Alternative is "built-in" dino - firmware initializes everything
in this case including PCI-PCI Bridges.)

That's fine...I'll clean it up when I get into ottawa in July and have
reliable bandwidth. Thanks for the heads up.
