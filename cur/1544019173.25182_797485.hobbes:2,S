Well, it's attributed to Tejun, and he probably sent you a "git diff". The 
delete part of such a diff is pretty small, so you both probably missed 
it at the top of the diff:
	diff --git a/arch/arm/mach-integrator/clock.h b/arch/arm/mach-integrator/clock.h
	deleted file mode 100644
	index e69de29..0000000
and then you used "git am -s" or something to apply it and delete that 
file.
No "git commit -a" necessary - just a simple "git diff" after having done 
a "make distclean" and then sending the result off by email without 
looking any closer..
