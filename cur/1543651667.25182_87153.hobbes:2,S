Its not a clocked bus. The 8 MHz means nothing. It's an async bus
and if the setup timing of the data/address-decode/chip-select sequence
is not violated, you get ~200ns between accesses so chip-to-chip
select time comes automatically. But, some older motherboards violated
all kinds of specs. They did this deliberately so you could plug
RAM boards into the ISA bus and get reasonable performance. If we still
support them, you need some artifical waits.

It's not the port address. It's the bus state. The chip requires two
consecutive writes when setting that latch. It's just like a 32-bit
write to a 32-bit port (like PCI access), you can't write to the
low-port, do something else, then write to the high port. It needs to be
done with no intervening bus states. In the AMD case, it's probably
because the address is ignored on the second write.
