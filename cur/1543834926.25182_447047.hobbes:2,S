hmm doesn't look like i can do this in 2.6.16.27:
# ls -l /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/cmd_per_lun
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jul 26 19:58 /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/cmd_per_lun
# echo 85 >!$
echo 85 >/sys/class/scsi_host/host0/cmd_per_lun
zsh: permission denied: /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/cmd_per_lun
it'll probably be sometime until i update this box past 2.6.16.x ... but 
i'll keep it in mind and retry the experiment... thanks.
