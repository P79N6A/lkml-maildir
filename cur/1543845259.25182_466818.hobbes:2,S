We started out with a machine-specific header.  The general feedback on 
the linux-pm list was that a complete machine independent interface was 
preferred.  At first Eugeny and I were against that but the resulting 
interface is much more flexible.  Users of the PowerOP API do not have 
to include an asm/powerop.h to use it.  Instead you can get all the 
information you need from the interface.  Also, using the current 
implementation you can get/set any arbitrary number and order of the 
power parameters.  For example, a platform has parameters p0-p5.  An 
operating point could be registered with values for p0,p1 and another 
with p0,p1,p2,p3,p4 and p5.  The code that registers operating points 
and accesses existing operating points don't have to know the correct 
order of  parameters, provide values for the entire parameter list or 
have a machine specific header.  In addition to being machine 
independent, the current implementation seems to  works nicely for 
integrating with cpufreq.
We are not completely satisfied with the string parsing that results 
from the current interface but we can improve it over time.
