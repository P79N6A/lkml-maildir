The system binaries are normally not considered secret.  (You can
download source for any of them.)  So why prevent anyone from reading them?
Reading the binaries are convenient for copying them, or backing them
up.  This don't happen often, but there is no need to make life difficult
as these files contain no secrets.
Similiarly - lots of files in etc could be made root only.  But
there is no need.  Making more stuff root only also force people to
use root more often, which is a bad thing.
