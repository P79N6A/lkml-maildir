I begin having problems with less and man starting with 2.6.9.
I noticed some posts on the kernel list complaining of ssh failures
which were caused by using legacy ptys.  I changed this in config:
CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS=y
CONFIG_LEGACY_PTYS=y
CONFIG_LEGACY_PTY_COUNT=256
(linux-2.6.8.1)
to this
CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS=y
# CONFIG_LEGACY_PTYS is not set
(linux-2.6.10-rc1)
and less/man is back to running.
