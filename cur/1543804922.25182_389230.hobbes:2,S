In this case, I will read ABCDEFG without errors, and then I with an overrun

Yes, in this case I will read ABCDEFG without error, and then H with
an overrun error.  But the UART still hold "I" in its "read buffer".
The "read buffer" is exist outside the receiver FIFO.  So if 'J' comes
in later, I will read "IJ".  There is no way to clear the "read
buffer" except resetting the UART.
Resetting the whole UART is too intrusive, so I chose a way in the
patch (Ignore just next one char after an overrun error.)
