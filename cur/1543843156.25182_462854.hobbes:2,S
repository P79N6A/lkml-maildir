That would be helpful, only how to do it? We need some sort of list or
array where to store the pages that should be made volatile. The main
problem that I see is that you have to remove a page that is freed from
the list/array again, otherwise you would end up with a non page-cache
page being made volatile. That makes using per-cpu arrays hard since a
page can be freed on another cpu.
