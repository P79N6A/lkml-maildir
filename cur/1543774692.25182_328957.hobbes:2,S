Subject: [PATCH] fs:lock_rename()/unlock_rename() can lead to deadlock in distributed fs.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The problem with lock_rename() is that it compares parent directory dentries  
when trying to decide how many inode i_sem semaphores to acquire.  That works  
fine on a single node system, but not in a distributed environment, on a  
distributed filesystem.  
The problem with rename(2) in a cluster, is that there is no guarantee that  
path_lookup()s will return a coherent path structure while at the same time  
renames, on another node, are executing on that same path hierarchy.  In our  
case, in do_rename(), the parent directory path_lookup()s find/create unique  
dentries for the old_dir and new_dir, however, because a rename(2) on another  
node was executing, both dentries end up pointing to the same inode.  
When lock_rename(new_dir, old_dir) is called, the dentries don't match, so we  
end up in a code path that tries to acquire the inode i_sem of both the  
old_dir and new_dir, but since they point to the same inode, the second  
attempt to acquire the same i_sem results in a deadlock.  
A fix would be to compare the dentries ->d_inode field instead.  Patch for  
kernel 2.6.12.1 attached.
Author of the patch is Michael Gaughen <mgaughen@polyserve.com>

===================================================================
#
# This patch changes lock_rename()/unlock_rename() to compare the inodes
# referenced by the dentries.  The problem with distributed filesystems is
# that there is no guarantee the path_lookup() will return valid path dentry 
# components at the same time rename(2)s of that same path hierarchy are 
# executing on another node.  So there are cases where the dentries, passed 
# to lock_rename()/unlock_rename(), are different, but refer to the same 
# inode.  In that case, the check for equivalent dentries will fail, and an
# attempt to acquire each of the dentries inode will be made, resulting in
# a deadlock since the inodes are the same.
