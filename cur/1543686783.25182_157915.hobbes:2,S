Nice. 
Funny you should mention xmms in the same sentence since that's an app that 
works fine. I was under no illusion that O16s were going to make these apps 
perform well.  Now you have to clarify what you mean by game test as being 
impossible. I assume you mean wine based games? The only game I own is 
neverwinternights and that performs beautifully. You have to tell me about 
this blender app? I'm unable to fully reproduce these problems here as the 
only thing exhibiting starvation is a mozilla plugin that is busy on wait 
using the libgdk(something) library, and it is usable without starvation 
albeit at sucky performance. If you can profile blender sucking it would be 
helpful.

It's not a matter of light versus heavy, it's only select applications. Try 
running your machine at absurd loads (without hitting swap) with apps that 
don't exhibit it. 
Since these are the last thing in my gunsights for the interactivity 
development I'd appreciate as much info as anybody has on what happens when 
they suck, and if profiling can find a common link. Since I own none of the 
apps that do this I can only try to fix them with your help. If someone is 
available for frequent small patch testing that would also be helpful as that 
helped the other interactivity development, so please email me directly.
