For reasons not yet clear to me, it appears the L1 driver has a bug or
the device itself has trouble with DMA in high memory.  This patch,
drafted by Luca Tettamanti, is being explored as a workaround.  I'd be
interested to know if it fixes your problem.
[Aside: For future reference, atl1-devel@lists.sourceforge.net is a
mailing list devoted to L1 driver development.]
