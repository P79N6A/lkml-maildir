I agree, that's one reason I really hate the "default" attributes :(
To do this "right" we need to make the attributes dynamically created
and the owner set to the proper module.  I did that for the module core
code and it's on my todo list for the driver core too.

They are popular for when you don't have a "bus", and rightfully so.
