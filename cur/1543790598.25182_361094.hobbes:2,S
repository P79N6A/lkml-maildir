Subject: zoran drivers: absense of locking?

I've tried to read random part of a tree and now scratching my head
with a question:
	what protects the number and a list of registered codecs in
	zoran drivers?
Example: drivers/media/video/zr36050.c:
	/* amount of chips attached via this driver */
	static int zr36050_codecs = 0;
Decremented in zr36050_unset().
Checked for maximum value, used and incremented in zr36050_setup().
[Assigment to 0 in zr36050_init_module is not needed. dprintk() in
zr36050_cleanup_module() should be converted to BUG_ON, so I'll ignore
them.]
	zr36050_codecs
		zr36050_unset()	= struct videocodec::unset
		zr36050_setup()	= struct videocodec::setup
The only place where ->unset and ->setup methods are called is
drivers/media/video/videocodec.c:
	zr36050_codecs
		zr36050_unset()
			videocodec_detach()
		zr36050_setup()
			videocodec_attach()
Both videocodec functions are exported.
No spinlocks or semaphores in sight.
Does anybody know what protects the list of registered codecs in zoran
drivers?
