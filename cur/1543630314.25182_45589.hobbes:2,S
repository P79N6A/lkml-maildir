So, the way this would work (presumably) is that space gets reserved on
the filesystem as soon as the page goes dirty, if space is not presently
allocated for that page.  The process would receive a SIGBUS if they
attempt to write to the page, but backing store reservation failed, as
they do when, eg., there's an IO error on a page or some such.
If the mapping was held by more than one process, and one had permission
to dirty the page and the other did not, then whose credentials should
get used would just be a matter of which one writes first.  If the disk
is full for users and root dirties the page first, then the user can
re-dirty it.  If the user dirties it first, then the user receives
SIGBUS.  If the disk is full for everyone, then either one would receive
the signal.
