Ok, I was misunderstanding what you meant by wakeup device support. if you 
are meaning things like wake-on-lan then yes, you do loose that with no 
ACPI support, but that is acceptable to many people. I understand it's not 
for some, and I'm not saying that this should be the only type of suspend, 
but I'm also saying that this should be one option.
