I agree that argv[0] checking is different from pathname-based access control
or label-based access control, but I want to say argv[0] checking is still needed.
If you don't check argv[0], an attacker can request everything like
exec { "/bin/ls" } "/sbin/busybox", "cat", "/etc/shadow";
exec { "/bin/ls" } "/sbin/busybox", "rm", "/etc/shadow";
if /bin/ls and /bin/cat and /bin/rm are hardlinks of /sbin/busybox (e.g. embedded systems).
Therefore, TOMOYO Linux checks the combination of filename and argv[0] passed to execve().
Thanks.
