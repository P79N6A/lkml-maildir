That's like disabling memory over-commit in the regular kernel.
Don't you think this should again be based on the systems configuration
of over-commit?

Please see the patching of Rohit's memory controller for user
level patching. It seems much simpler.

I would prefer a different set
1 & 2, for now we could use any interface and then start developing the
controller. As we develop the new controller, we are likely to find the
need to add/enhance the interface, so freezing in on 1 & 2 might not be
a good idea.
I would put 4, 5 and 6 ahead of 3, based on the changes I see in Rohit's
memory controller.
Then take up the rest.
