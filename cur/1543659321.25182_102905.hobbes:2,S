Hmm, currently that is correct. There doesn't appear to be a
"standard" symbol name applied to the immediate end of the bss
section. Different architectures are using different names:
   _ebss        -- m68knommu, v850
   __bss_stop   -- i386, alpha, ppc, s390
   __bss_end    -- x86_64
   _end         -- mips, parisc, sparc, (actually most have this)
Actually it looks like _end is probably closer, it seems to
almost always fall strait after the bss, on just about every
architecture that has it.
Come to think of it _end is probably more appropriate anyway.
Since that code is trying to find the location of something
concatenated to the end of the kernel image.
Regards
Greg
