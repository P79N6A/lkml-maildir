your root partition is mounted.  if you specify a root system on a device
other than your typical /dev/hda, the driver for that critter kicks in and
sets things up.
/dev is such a crucial part of the system it makes very good sense to start
support for it automatically.  just like it makes real good sense to have
the console support in the kernel because pretty much everyone uses it.

imo, ease and simplicity are very good reasons.  reducing the number of
steps necessary for the majority of systems v.s. adding one lilo option to
disable the auto start of it is a win.
