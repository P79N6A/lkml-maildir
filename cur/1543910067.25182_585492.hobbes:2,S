Not that way! It's a good thing that people have different experiences
and hence viewpoints. Maybe the concept of PFN sharing are
straightforward to you, while I have been playing with seq_file a lot.

That could be true.  Maybe some user with huge datasets will give us
some idea about the performance. I don't know, maybe it's application
dependent.
Anyway I don't think it's fair to merge a binary interface without the
challenge from a textual one ;)
