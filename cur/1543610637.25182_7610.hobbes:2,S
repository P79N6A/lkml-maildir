Have you been following the kbuild 2.5 developments[1]?  Linus has
agreed that this change will go in early in the 2.5 cycle, that will
impact on all automated testing for 2.5.  There will be both good and
bad impacts, the bad is the initial changeover, the good is a much
cleaner build process and the ability to build multiple configurations
from a single source tree.
