Hi All,
  I am trying to use the "int mount() system call as a super user. Although 
it works for floppy, but for cdrom I get the message "permission denied" and 
the error code of 13 is set.
  mount("/dev/cdrom", "/mnt/cdrom", "iso9660", MD_RDONLY, NULL);
  Can soemone please give me some suggestions.
   Thnks,
    Sid.
