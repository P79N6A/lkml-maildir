Hi.  I have lately had an error that will stall the boot process.  I
have a bad feeling that it might be hardware, but need just a bit more
information.  The error I get is:
hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x60
hda: DMA timeout retry
hda: timeout waiting for DMA
My distro: Fedora Core 1
Kernel version: 2.6.2-rc3-bk1
My APIC has integrated dma controllers and is a SiS 961
lspci also reports:
00:02.0 ISA bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] SiS961 [MuTIOL
Media IO]
00:02.1 SMBus: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS]: Unknown device 0016
I looked in /documentation and grepped some of the kernel source for dma
status, but haven't found a dma status of 0x60 (other statuses, but not
0x60 or 96).  TIA
Bob
