Could you give all of these 0's a name?  I really hate seeing random
magic numbers in these things.  0 completely kills the ability of
someone to read the code and figure out what it is trying to do without
going and looking at reserve_bootmem().
Or, alternatively, do something like this:
-extern void reserve_bootmem(unsigned long addr, unsigned long size);
+/*
+ * If flags is 0, then the return value is always 0 (success). If
+ * flags contains BOOTMEM_EXCLUSIVE, then -EBUSY is returned if the
+ * memory already was reserved.
+ */
+extern int reserve_bootmem(unsigned long addr, unsigned long size, int flag);
+int reserve_bootmem(unsigned long addr, unsigned long size)
+{
+	/* the 0 is because we don't
+	return reserve_bootmem_exclusive(addr, size, 0);
+}
Where all of the existing callers stay the same.  But, the ones wanting
exclusive access actually call the _exclusive() variant.
