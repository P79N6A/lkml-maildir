No, I don't see any codepaths that could lead to it being used uninitialized. 
I made the patch for two reasons;  1) To silence the warning, and I
guess it's simply the right thing to do.   2) To make sure the code
behaves in a resonably sane way in case the situation
c->parm.length==0 should somehow happen in the future.
