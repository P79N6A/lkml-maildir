What I'm getting is a usual stale lock case - node(s) bootup
gets stuck to first attempted file lock (wtmp in this case).

Wtmp is locked and client remains waiting for it to be
released. It's as if server lock state was persistent over
crash and both ways busted notification cycle makes
sure lock is never released. Server never grants a new
lock to this file.
But I take it that lock state(s) are not supposed to be
persistent over crash? Umm.

Sure, but I need the locks..

Client has root on top of NFS. Thus, if the server goes
away it's 'quite likely' for things to jam in the client and
in this case we have a HA setup that reacts to this.
One more thing. Restarting server statd once clients
are up helps instantly.
