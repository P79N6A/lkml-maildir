This is PCPartner TXB820DS motherboard (Socket 7, i430TX) with 1998 
Award BIOS and C-states seem to work fine. I've tested it in Windows 98 
some time ago - the CPU is almost cold when idle with ACPI enabled and 
hot with ACPI disabled (that's partly caused by the fact that Windows 9x 
does not HLT the CPU when idle). With Pentium 100MHz in the socket and 
ACPI enabled, I could even touch the CPU (without heatsink) without 
burning my fingers.
