Ok sorry only the pageattr_32 hunks would need to be undone.
So it would be something like:
drop venki's 32bit patch
insert my patch to add cpa_addr()
reinsert venki's patch with the pageattr_32 hunks dropped after it
drop venki's 64bit patch
insert my patch to add reserved checking on 64bit cpa
reinsert venki's patch with the pageattr_64 hunks dropped after it
The result should be bisectable.

What is a revert barrier?
Anyways of course the way to handle that is the same as with the other undo
patches: drop the original white space changes (ddb53b5735793a19dc17bcd98b050f672f) 
completely and then drop that undo patch too. The white space changes haven't reached 
Linus yet so you can just make them disappear completely from known history.
