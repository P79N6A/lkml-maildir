"e.g." is okay, "in case the drives are PIO" is not,
unmask also affects DMA (I believe it is not needed for DMA but ...)

moving ->fixup() execution from probe_hwif_init_with_fixup() to probe_hwif()
(just before code which does PIO / DMA tuning)
From what I see it shouldn't affect current ->fixup users
(and is saner because currently "undecoded slave" is also tuned).
