Of course "accessing /dir1/dir2/file" is meant from the global viewpoint, the
application should access "file" or "/file". (I do not see why access to "/dir2/file"
could succeed, because the process already chrooted to "/dir1/dir2" and therefore would
try to access "/dir1/dir2/dir2/file" from the global POV,)

Okay. So root cannot depend on setting the rights of /dir1 to "000", but usually it
works.

I know that hard links (implemented in the current way) also somewhat mess up the idea
of grouping files into a directory and assigning rights to this bunch of files. (As
there might be alternative reachabilities.) (I probably should consider a chroot a kind
of temporary hard link, giving an alternative, independent way to reach files and
directories.)

Only if you do "instant resolving", trying to avoid information duplication. As I
explained in other mails, I do not believe that this is necessary.

Of course, I would resolve using the shortest way (relative pathname). But the surprise
to be not able to access /dir1/dir4/file while it is globally reachable is high. (But
this is the way the system currently works, isn't it?). If I understand correctly,
prohibiting access to "dir2" means creating an "access barrier". Usually, it should
barrier accesses coming from the root down to the requested fs object. But in this case,
it's meaning is somewhat inverted. A process with CWD="/dir1/dir2/dir3" may access
everything inside the barrier (using "." as its starting point), but nothing outside of
it. Is this the intended way it should work? The ACL system might solve this ...
"feature".
