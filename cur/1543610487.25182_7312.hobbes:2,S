Redhat apologists are given the due they deserve.
Their first cut at a released 2.96 should never have made it out of the
labs alive, and for that matter, neither should have 7.0.
That said, the versions in 7.1, and the patches available have done
reasonably well for everything that I've tried to compile (kernels
included).
What are they going to do about gcc 3.0.x? It'll be amusing to watch.
