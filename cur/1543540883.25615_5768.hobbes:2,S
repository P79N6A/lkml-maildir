IRIX 6.5.x has a kernel parameter limiting the amount of memory an ordinary 
user can lock. In case a user goes over this maximum the mlockall call will 
fail. In case the user has specified MCL_FUTURE, a SIGSEGV will be raised 
with a special code. (At least that is what they say they do, but in reality 
this doesn't work).
IMHO, an ordinary user may only lock a limited amount of memory. Maybe it is 
wise to specify a certain amount which may *not* be locked. This memory is 
reserved for the rest of the processes.
