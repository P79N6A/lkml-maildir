That is why I didn't fence COMMAND_LINE_SIZE by __KERNEL__ initialy
and thought about if LILO could had been using it. Then I found a
post in old-dated LKML that LILO has its own definition for
such a symbol, then I asked you about boot protocol. I just
didn't understand why you're confused but nevermind :)
