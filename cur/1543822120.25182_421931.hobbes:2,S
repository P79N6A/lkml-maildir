I don't doubt that, but we're going in circles here. I never alleged this 
message was useful for everyone, but it IS useful for users with a working 
keyboard and specifically with mechanical switches (can be triggered by a 
loose cable or too slow turning of the dial, this a few times repeated can
cause the keyboard *port* to lock up, requiring a reboot).
If you have broken hardware that keeps triggering an error message that 
is valid and informative for a majority of users, use the source and 
comment it out. Nobody has a problem with that.
But don't try something that will leave us with no error messages left in 
the long run because somebody somewhere with broken hard- or software got 
spammed by them.
To the topic starter: calling such a message "silly" is pretty silly. And 
that from a distro maintainer..
