Subject: [BUG REPORT]  Conflict between Tulip driver w/ LinkSys 100LNE and EEPro  driver w/  Intel PCI EtherExpress Pro100 82557
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

The problem: I can't have the Tulip and EEPro drivers loaded at the same
time.  If I have the Tulip driver loaded, and I load the EEPro driver, the
self check fails with 0xffffffff and complains that I don't have the card in
a bus master slot.  If I have the EEPro driver loaded and the ether tested
as working, and I insmod the tulip driver, this happens:

Another problem is that despite the fact that I don't have a 100Mbps network
at the moment, the Tulip driver doesn't give me a way to override the (I've
tried the insmod options=0x9 to get MII autodetect) stupid default that the
Linksys morons left in the EEProm.
/proc/pci entries for the cards:
