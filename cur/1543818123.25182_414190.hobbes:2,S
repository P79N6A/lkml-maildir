You're right.  If we do ever get any hardware that requires this we can
always change it later on.
Another thing, could you pleas change the stack allocation in final so
that it does it like cbc_process_decrypt? The reason is that gcc is too
stupid to not allocate that buffer unconditionally.
Thanks,
