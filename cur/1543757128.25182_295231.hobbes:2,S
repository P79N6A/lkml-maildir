This is wrong, and highlights a problem with the "remote" dma pool API.
dma_alloc_coherent() normally returns CPU-local memory, unless you've
declared remote memory, in which case it's __iomem-type memory.
Therefore, I don't think we want to mark the return value of
dma_alloc_coherent with __iomem, because in the vast majority of
cases, it isn't.
