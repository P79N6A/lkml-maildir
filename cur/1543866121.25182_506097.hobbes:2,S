    In the realtime preemption mode, spinlocks are implemented via mutexes, 
and the kernel may be preempted if the lock it's trying to acquire is already 
taken by another process which shouldn't happen in the interrupt (or otherwise 
non-preempatble) context. In such context, the "raw" spinlocks must still be 
used which are (almost?) the same as the "usual" Linux spinlocks.
    IIUC, the notion of the interrupt context" in the realtim (and also in the 
low-latency desktop with hardirq preemption) mode is somewhat different form 
the usual as the interrupt handlers are executed in their own threads, and so, 
out of the interrupt context (that's not an absolute law: the timer interrupts 
are still handled the usual way, for example)...
    I hope Ingo will correct me where I may be wrong. :-)

    Yes, it's CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT specific. That's whey I specified 2.6.20-rt3 
in the subject.

    In my turn, I'd like to have your (or anybody's) comments since I have 
doubts about the nee of some conversions below which Mark have originally done 
(though I limited myself to only adding couple more that seemed really necessary)

    Erm, not very sure about irq_big_lock -- seems to only be used by IRQ 
mapping code...

    Not sure about this one -- it seemed to guard reserving/releasing the PMC 
hardware (by Oprofile) and only be taken out of the interrupt context...

    The PURR spinlock obviously needed to be raw being used by the timer 
interrupt.

    Not sure about this one -- it seemed to only be taken out of the interrupt 
context...

    This one is also taken by the OpenPIC code in the interrupt context.
