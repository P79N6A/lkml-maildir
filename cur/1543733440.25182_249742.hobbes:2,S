Is that really needed?  If in_file->f_op->sendfile() returns some
error, it's already handled above.  If it returns 0, done remains 0
and we return 0, indicating EOF.  And the check for pending signals
happens after handling the first chunk, so -EINTR shouldn't be
necessary.
But I could be stupid and miss something.
