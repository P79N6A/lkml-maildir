I didn't think that would work if there is no TLB. But if the writeback
can cause a TLB reload, and then bypass the readonly protection, then
yes would close all races.
Of course, you may also want to do the racy cache flush before the
TLB flush as well, so you don't immediately take a load of TLB misses
to write it out.
