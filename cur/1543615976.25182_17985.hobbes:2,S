This is for sure no VM issue. This is strange, is this with VMware started,
inside XP? Does this happen under Linux-only, too (with no vmware running)?
It doesn't even look quite like a linux issue at all. Just guessing: do you
have a virus-checker for XP at hand? Only to make sure...

This can be driven without swap for sure.
