I don't see why this would be an advantage. IMHO Documentation belongs
in the Documentation tree and configuration documentation belongs in
Configure.help. You almost never read that file yourself, only the
various kernel configure tools read it, and tools don't have a problem
with large files. It's better to have the documentation at a single
point, not scattered around in the kernel tree.

Shouldn't be too hard.
