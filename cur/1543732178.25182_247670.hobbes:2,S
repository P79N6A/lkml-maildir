hotplug is enabled in the kernel (compiled-in, not modular) and here's what 
I have:
[2302][~]# cat /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug
/sbin/hotplug
[2302][~]# /sbin/hotplug
Usage: /etc/hotplug.d/default/default.hotplug AgentName [AgentArguments]
AgentName values on this system:  dasd firmware ieee1394 input net pci scsi 
tape usb
[2302][~]#
And there's no oops in /var/log/messages or in dmesg.  Is there anywhere 
else it'd show up?
Thanks,
Anthony
