It would be nice to have a knob in /proc/sys which could be tuned for
response or throughput, Preferably not a boolean;-) I suspect that we
would have lack of agreement on what that would do, but it sure would be
nice!

I have the feeling that 2.5 is less good about noting that a file is open
for write only and no seeks have been done. I haven't measured it, but it
would seem that writes to such a file would be better on the disk and not
taking buffers, since they're probably not going to be read.
This is just based on running mkisofs on 2.4.19 and 2.5.34, a watching "no
disk activity" followed by a heavy burst. I haven't made any careful
measurement, so take this as you will, but I agree that heavy write bogs
the system. Clearly with big memory I can/do get the whole ~700MB in
memory if writes don't start quickly.
Yes, that could be tuning, I know that.

On small memory machines I don't see as much to choose, and the -ck series
has been very nice to me. I don't run 2.5 on any but test machines, and
both are big memory (1+GB) machines.
