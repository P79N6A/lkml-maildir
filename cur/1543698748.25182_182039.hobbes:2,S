That's a bad idea for technical reasons too - how often do we have to tell
people not to use kernel headers from userspace?  glibc-kernheaders (and whatever
non-RedHat boxes call it) exists for a reason.
Interestingly enough, at least on my Fedora box, 'rpm -qi' reports glibc as LGPL,
but glibc-kernheaders as GPL, which seems right to me - linking against glibc gives
the LGPL semantics as we'd want, but forces userspace that's poking in the kernel
to be GPL as a derived work....
