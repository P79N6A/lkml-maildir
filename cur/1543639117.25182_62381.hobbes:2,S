Nothing at all, but isn't that how the scsi ASSERT_LOCK(&lock, 0)
macro worked before?  I could just remove all those checks in the scsi
code I guess.
After I posted the last patch, a few people asked for MUST_NOT_HOLD so
I added it back in.  Do you think it's a bad idea?  See the last
thread if you're curious (Joshua's comments in particular):
