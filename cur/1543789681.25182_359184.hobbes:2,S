Last night I just caught a bug I accidentally introduced with the fixed
interval math (oh, if only optimizations didn't dirty code so!), where
time inconsistencies were possible when clocksources were changed. I'm
not sure if that's the issue being seen above, but I'll wrap things up
and send out a B8 release today if I can.
