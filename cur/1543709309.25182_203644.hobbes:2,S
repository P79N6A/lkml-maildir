What file systems work on defect media? 
As for crashed disks I rarely bothered trying to "fix" them anymore. I save
what I can and restore what's backed up and recovery tools (other than
the undo-delete ones) usually destroy what's left, but that's not unique to
XFS. Depending on how good my backups are I sometimes try the recovery
tools just to see, but that has never helped so far.
