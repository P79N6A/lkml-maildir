There is nothing wrong on our end, the conversion happened and was pushed
to master.kernel.org about 30 hours ago as part of the normal nightly update.
I logged into to master.kernel.org and checked:
lm@hera:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/bkcvs/linux-2.5(0)$ grep v2.6.10 ChangeSet,v
        v2_6_10:1.24782
	v2_6_10-rc3:1.24616
	v2_6_10-rc2:1.24188
	v2_6_10-rc1:1.23259
