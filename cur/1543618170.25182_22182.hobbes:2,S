Okay if the execution of the command block is ATOMIC, and we want to stop
an ATOMIC operation to go alter buffers?  But that is not the real
question.  The real question is do we stop and ATOMIC process to return
data of a partial completeion, and then return to a HALTED ATOMIC and hope
it will still go?
DEAD Method:
issue atomic write 255 sectors
	write 8 sector or 4k or 1 page of memory
	interrupt_issued
		exit atomic write
			update top layer buffers
			return;
	continue write_loop;
	exit on completion and update remainder.
BASTARDIZED Method:
issue write 255 sectors
	truncate to max of 8 sectors
	issue atomic write 8 sectors
		interrupt_issued
		end request and notify 4k page complete
	make new request and merge and repeat.
	note there is a new memcpy fo new request. (max 16 to completion)
OLD Method, with Request Page Walking:
issue atomic write 255 sectors
        write sectors
        interrupt_issued
		walk copy of request
	continue write_loop;
	exit on completion and request and free local buffer.
CORRECT Method:
collect contigious physical buffer of 255 sectors
memcpy_to_local (one memcpy)
issue atomic write 255 sectors
	write sectors
	interrupt_issued
		update pointer
	continue write_loop;
	exit on completion and request and free local buffer.
The price of the overhead and the direct flakyness of the driver we are
running from is returning, so the alternative is to disable MULTI-Sector
Operations.
