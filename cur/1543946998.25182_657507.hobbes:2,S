I seem to have run into some sort of regression in the SG_IO interface of 2.6.24.2. 
I have an application that up until 2.6.24 worked fine. The 2.6.23.16 kernel works fine.
During reads I get these kernel messages. Writes and other functions _seem_ OK. Actually basic
reads  are working. Its with large BC reads using an io_vec list that the problem shows up.

The status elements of the sg_io_hdr_t structure used in the application returns
 status = 0x0 msg_status 0x0 host_status = 0x7 driver_status = 0x0
The hardware in use on this particular machine is an simple Adaptec AHA-2930CU talking to an old
IMPRIMIS 94601-15 1.2GB disk drive.
Again, all this works fine with the 2.6.23.11 kernel
Any help would be appreciated
