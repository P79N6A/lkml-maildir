If we're really curious...

This is my secondary name server.  This was also after an upgrade from
a 386 because bind9 is a bloody pig. :)  To be honest I've thought about
putting the 386 back in service as something else because unlike my web
server and primary name server there's no chance a CPU fan on it is
going to die causing a CPU to fry and the system to crash.  At one point
the 386 had a 630 day uptime, running 2.2.16.
