People tend to make jokes about optimizing the idle loop too, but they're
actually wrong. Exit latency for the idle loop is important -- it 
decides how quickly you can react to load changes on idle CPUs.
For short udelays I suspect shorter exit latency is also moderately useful.
But anyways there are plenty of gtod users outside the X server.
e.g. common not user space case is packet timestamps.
