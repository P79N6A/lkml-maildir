It makes no sense to keep the kernel driver uptodate, it would make
more sense to support the latest driver (which some people are
supporting).
I just had a look at the driver downloads it makes around 600
downloads for september for this driver. If someone's interested in
those stats I can give access to it privatly.
The current option for people who own such a device is to take the
driver from mcentral.de.
