There is a better tool (for this particular task), called "cvsup". It 
does a wonderful job of keeping cvs repositories in synch. I realize I 
just asked for a THIRD tool, so it should only go in if the admins are 
willing to take care of it.
The idea is that it uses the full duplexity of the channel to get client 
side information about the repository on that end while downloading 
changes, thus increasing the effective bandwidth. It only falls back to 
rsynch if CVS repository specific updates are not possible. I use it on 
the Wine repository, and it does, indeed, work very efficiently.
On the negative side - as far as I could tell, neither RedHat nor 
Mandrake carry it as a standard package (Debian does, at least in unstable).
