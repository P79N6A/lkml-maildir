no, the task got blocked _again_, as part of a _new_ blocking chain, and 
there's a _new_ PI waiter! How does the two-lock preemptible boosting 
algorithm ensure that if we are in the middle of boosting a 
blocking-dependency chain:
   T1 -> T2 -> ... -> TI -> TI+1 -> ... TN-1 -> TN
we are at TI, and we [the task doing the boosting] now get preempted.
What prevents TI from being part of a _totally new_ blocking-chain, 
where the only similarity between the two chains is that TI is in the 
middle of it:
   T1' -> T2' -> ... -> TI -> TI+1' -> ... TM-1 -> TM'
the only match between the two chains is 'TI'. Now the algorithm will
happily walk the wrong boosting chain, and will boost the wrong tasks.
