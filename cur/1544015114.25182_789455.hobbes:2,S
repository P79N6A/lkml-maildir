    dlm: change rsbtbl rwlock to spinlock
    The rwlock is almost always used in write mode, so there's no reason
    to not use a spinlock instead.

    dlm: fix seq_file usage in debugfs lock dump
    
    The old code would leak iterators and leave reference counts on
    rsbs because it was ignoring the "stop" seq callback.  The code
    followed an example that used the seq operations differently.
    This new code is based on actually understanding how the seq
    operations work.  It also improves things by saving the hash bucket
    in the position to avoid cycling through completed buckets in start.
