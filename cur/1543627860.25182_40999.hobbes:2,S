I've seen some Intel bench's and they are specing an increase of 0% to 30%
(Though check Anandtech, he did a benchmark on his DB, and got a small
performance Decrease on a test!)
After looking at the Hyperthreading Doc's, It looks like they are trying to
utilize some of the idle time the Execution engine has while waiting for
other ops to happen,  Trace code misses, and such.  Strap on an extra
processor state, and get some extra oomph.  Hey, the P4 can use all the
extra oomph it can get!
