   I think we need no new signals. All what we need is to revoke
all file handles connected to the device having been unplugged.

   The question is whether we really want to handle such situation
without userland noticing the exchange or whether the right view
is "the old device ceased to exist, a new one appeared with the
same name, all programs need to re-open it."
   (Please note that in the most common cases, i.e. swapping of disks
in a disk array or replacing faulty network cards, the exchange can
be fully transparent even without introducing any additional mechanisms
and without userland programs noticing it.)
				Have a nice fortnight
