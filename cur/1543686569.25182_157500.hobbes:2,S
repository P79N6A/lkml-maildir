If my guess from my previous email was correct (that is pri 5 gets 
shorter timeslide than pri 6), then that means that tasks of higher 
static priority have are penalized more than lower pri tasks for expiring.
Say a task has to run for 15ms.  If it's at a priority that gives it a 
10ms timeslice, then it'll expire and get demoted.  If it's at a 
priority that gives it a 20ms timeslice, then it'll not expire and 
therefore get promoted.
Is that fair?
