Linking isn't the issue.  I went and read the original bug on this a
while back.  The issue is that it's a program that's distributed in
binary form without source code.  That's forbidden from being in main
by the terms of the Debian Social Contract.
I realise there's a grey area between "magic data you write to a device"
and "a program that is executed on a different processor".  For example,
palette data for a frame buffer.  But nobody's arguing for that grey
area here -- it's clearly a program without source code that Debian
can't distribute.
I think this is a terribly unfortunate state of affairs and I'm not happy
about how it's been handled or communicated.  I'd really appreciate it
if someone managed to think of a good solution to this.
