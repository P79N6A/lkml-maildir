Hi Selva,
You can go through, one of the help link on the log msgs...
     
http://www.hk8.org/old_web/linux/run/ch08_03.htm
I think, they(kernel printk's) are directing to the console only...
Or you can observe, initially while booting it up, after console initiation
happened, it starts buffering out all the printk's output to the console
only.
But i did't remember, the code flow, at a particular point, the X or
something
the shell will take over of it...But any emergency msgs, from the kernel,
will be
coming onto the Console only...
I think, for your error msg, you can better google it...Its not able to
recognise,
the boot partition may be...
Regards,
srinivas.
