Hi,
This question might have been raised before but I am stucked in
between wierd/helpless situation and wondering if someone can help me
out.
I have Red Hat Linux 6.2 (2.2.14-5.0smp) running in my HP Netserver
box. I have 2 9.1 GB HDD. The server has been up for few months and
have not had seen any problem. But today all of sudden it gave
panicking message saying following:

I have system running but cannot access files/database saved in
volumes in the second HDD sdb. Following are the partitions I have and
I haven't used any RAID while instaling, means plain hard drive spaces
in 2 drives.
/dev/sdb6               917072    732972    137516  84% /
/dev/sda1                18820      5811     12037  33% /boot
/dev/sda6              2218336    462492   1643156  22% /www
/dev/sda5              5297560    418936   4609520   8% /home
/dev/sda7              1210440    711516    437436  62% /software
/dev/sdb1              5550188     50896   5217356   1% /usr
/dev/sdb5              2016016     28572   1885032   1% /var
I can access files in all the other partitions but cannot access
files/directories in partition /www. I can see files in the
directories listing using 'ls' however accessing any file gives
Input/Output error saying:
cat check1.htm: Input/output error
Can anyone help/suggest me what should I do to make it work? I am
wondering if I reboot the system, I may fall into problem on booting
itself. Is there any thing I need to do to make this partition work?
Thanks in advance for the help.
Regards
Manohar
