Well I guess that would be the case if you had just unmapped a 4MB
chunk that was pretty dense with pages.
My malloc seems to allocate and free in blocks of 128K, so that's
only going to give us 3% of the last level pte being cache hot when
it gets freed. Not sure what common mmap(file) access patterns
look like.
The majority of programs I run have a smattering of llpt pages
pretty sparsely populated, covering text, libraries, heap, stack,
vdso.
We don't actually have to zap_pte_range the entire page table in
order to free it (IIRC we used to have to, before the 4lpt patches).
But yeah let's see some tests. I would definitely want to avoid this
extra layer of complexity if it is just as good to return the pages
to the pcp lists.
