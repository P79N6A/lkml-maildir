This finally uses the "static" per-cpu region for alloc_percpu.  It includes
a number of cleanups required to make that happen, and some cleanups are done
afterwards, with many more to come (eg. local_t is now more useful, if we sort
the semantics of what it should look like).

    alloc_percpu: big_percpu_alloc
    Impact: New API
    We never allowed the dynamic per-cpu allocator to use the per-cpu region,
    waiting until that region became resizable.  That was over 5 years ago.
    Christoph Lameter has demonstrated that small dynamic per-cpu allocations
    make sense, and most allocations are small.  So we want to use the same
    efficient per-cpu access paths for alloc_percpu() memory.
    But some places really do allocate large amounts of percpu memory.  We
    give them a separate API (equivalent to the current inefficient one).

    alloc_percpu: Move SNMP and ip_rt_acct to big_percpu
    If we look at percpu allocations to boot an x86/32 "allyesconfig"
    kernel, we see the following:

    net/ipv4/af_inet.c:1290		  1		 104		   104
    Subtotal:							103696
    Total (including other callers untouched by this patch)		117228
    So networking is chubby: worst case about 100k per cpu for SNMP stats.
    This can be reduced, but it's still 88% of the percpu memory, and IA64
    has a hardcoded limit of 64k at the moment.
    That's why these two callers get moved to big_percpu_alloc.
    Note: ip_rt_acct could be simplified and made more efficient by making
    it a DEFINE_PER_CPU.  But DaveM made some argument about image size
    and I have far too much respect to argue with BloatBoy :)

    alloc_percpu: remove alignment on cpu_workqueue_struct.
    Since we're improving alloc_percpu, we don't need to waste space.
    On 32-bit this drops struct cpu_workqueue_struct from 128 to 64 bytes.

    It's still the biggest dynamic percpu user though.

    alloc_percpu: change percpu_ptr to per_cpu_ptr
    Impact: cleanup
    There are two allocated per-cpu accessor macros with almost identical
    spelling.  The original and far more popular is per_cpu_ptr (44
    files), so change over the other 4 files.

    alloc_percpu: make the per cpu reserve configurable and larger.
    This is based on Christoph Lameter's "cpualloc: make the per cpu
    reserve configurable" patch, and his "Increase default reserve percpu
    area" patch.
    Christoph did the hard work of figuring out what the number should be
    (based on converting the slub allocator).  allyesconfig on x86-32 uses
    7k before mounting root, so 10k seems reasonable.

    Remove the "name" arg to percpu_modalloc, and make it zero memory.
    Make percpu_modfree take NULL without barfing.
    Make non-SMP versions do kzalloc/kfree.
    These trivial changes make it suitable for use as a general per-cpu

    This simply moves the percpu allocator functions from the module code
    to mm/allocpercpu.c.  percpu_modinit is renamed percpu_alloc_init and
    called from init/main.c.
    (Note: this allocator will need to be weaned off krealloc for use in
    the slab allocator itself as Christoph does in one of his patches).

    alloc_percpu: switch over to (renamed) percpu_modfree.
    Now the switch: rename percpu_modalloc to __alloc_percpu, and
    percpu_modfree to free_percpu and export them.
    We delete the old ones, including the unused percpu_alloc,
    percpu_alloc_mask and percpu_ptr.
    per_cpu_ptr now uses RELOC_HIDE on per_cpu_offset, just like static
    per-cpu variables (not SHIFT_PERCPU_PTR: this has side effects on
    S/390 and Alpha).
    The Alpha changes are untested.

    alloc_percpu: read_percpu_var / read_percpu_ptr
    Impact: New API
    get_cpu_var/get_cpu_ptr return lvalues, but for ia64 and x86/32 (and one
    day x86/64) there are more efficient ways if you just want an rvalue.
    The x86-specific versions have proven popular in that arch, so I expect
    they'll be popular generally.
    So introduce read_percpu_var and read_percpu_ptr.  They are separate,
    because when we enlarge percpu areas IA64 is not going to be able to
    do its trick on abitrary per-cpu pointers, only vars (which are in the
    first 64k).

    alloc_percpu: rename percpu vars which cause name clashes.
    Currently DECLARE_PER_CPU vars have per_cpu__ prefixed to them, and
    this effectively puts them in a separate namespace.  No surprise that
    they clash with other names when that prefix is removed.
    There may be others I've missed, but if so the transform is simple.

    alloc_percpu: remove per_cpu__ prefix.
    Now that the return from alloc_percpu is compatible with the address
    of per-cpu vars, it makes sense to hand around the address of per-cpu
    variables.  To make this sane, we remove the per_cpu__ prefix we used
    created to stop people accidentally using these vars directly.
    Now we have sparse, we can use that (next patch).
