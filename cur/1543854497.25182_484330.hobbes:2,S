Yeah.  As a bit of history, a lot of drivers would power down the phy 
when the interface was down, and so MII would need to be inaccessible. 
But that's really a driver policy thing.  If the driver provides a 
"don't power down phy, when interface is downed" knob, maybe it would 
want to support MII operations when !netif_running().
