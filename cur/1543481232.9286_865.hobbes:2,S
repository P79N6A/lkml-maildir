Well I upgraded from 2.2.0pre6 to 2.2.0pre8ac1 and after testing, the
messages have stopped and what seemed to be some kind of leak that
severly slowed down my connection once the socket destroy messages began
has also stopped. Loading apache and loading my page from a different
computer would set these two things off, and uploading files would as
well.
All is well here... 3com509b
