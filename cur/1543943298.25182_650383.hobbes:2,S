Interesting. So that means there is some operation we can't perform when
we are in NMI handler (Or nested NMIs, I don't know if this is nested NMI
case ).
Even if we initiated crash dump in NMI handler, next kernel should unlock
that state as soon as we enable interrupts in next kernel (iret will be
called).
So the only issue here will be if need to put the explicit logic to unlock
the NMI earlier (Either in crashing kernel after clearing IDT or in
purgatory code). Anything earlier then that, will be dangerous though, handling
another NMI while we are already crashed and doing final preparations to jump
to the new kernel.
Neil, is it possible to do some serial console debugging to find out
where exactly we are hanging? Beats me, what's that operation which can
not be executed while being in NMI handler and makes system to hang. I am
also curious to know if it is nested NMI case.
Thanks
