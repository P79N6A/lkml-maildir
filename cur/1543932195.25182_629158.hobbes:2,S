Here's a bunch of data:
port 0xF0: cycles: out 919, in 933
port 0xed: cycles: out 2541, in 2036
port 0x70: cycles: out n/a,  in 934
port 0x80: cycles: out 1424, in 795
AMD Turion 64x2 TL-60 CPU running at 800 MHz, nVidia MCP51 chipset, 
Quanta motherboard.  Running 2.6.24-rc5 with Ingo's patch so inb_p, etc. 
use port 0xed.
Note that I can run the port 80 test once, the second time I get the 
hard freeze.  I didn't try writing to port 70 from userspace - that 
one's dangerous, but the reading of it was included for a timing typical 
of a chipset supported device.  These are all pretty consistent.
I find the "read" timing from 0x80 verrrrry interesting.  The write 
timeing is also interesting, being faster than an unused port.
