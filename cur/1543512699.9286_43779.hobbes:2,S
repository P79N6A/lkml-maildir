    Ahhh I created a bogus partition on my machine too due the fdisk bug!
    After some time the kernel crashed and I destroyed all partitions of my
    hard disk. _all_. Note that the partition table was still fine. Only the
    contents of the partitons (superblocks mainly) was completly screwed up.
