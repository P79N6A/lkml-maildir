Subject: [PATCH] fix blockdev --getro for sr, sd, ide-floppy devs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This 2.6.1 patch works by setting gendisk->policy to the correct value
during initialization as the various drivers decide whether or not the
disk is writeable.  This patch persuades "blockdev --getro ..." to
correctly report the read-only state of a newly inserted disk.  This
patch applies to sr.c, sd.c and ide-floppy.c.  ide-cd.c already has
this functionality built into it.
Using an Iomega Zip drive as the test case...
Without the patch, I always see: 
$ sudo blockdev --getro /dev/sda 
0
$
That's only correct for writeable disks though.  Only when the patch
is applied do I see a write-protected disk described correctly:
$ sudo blockdev --getro /dev/sda 
1
$
