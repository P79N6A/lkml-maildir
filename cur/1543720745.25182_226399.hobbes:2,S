The -aa VM merge during 2.4.23, most notable 2.4.23-pre4:
  o aa VM merge: Per-zone watermark changes, add lower_zone_reserve_ratio
  o aa VM merge: page reclaiming logic changes: Kills oom killer
  o aa VM merge: Page accounting helpers changes
  o aa VM merge: tunables
  o aa VM merge: Kill PF_MEMDIE
  o aa VM merge: Fixup page reclaiming changes patch
That plus a few merge mistakes fixed during later 2.4.23-pre.
