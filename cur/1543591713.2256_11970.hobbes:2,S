	There is 3d+ some hours grace period during which vger

	system, BUT AFTER THAT STARTS BOUNCING.

	If you are unconnected for more than that 3d+, THEN
	you will be removed.  For few hours that is no problem.
	Begin connected to the network for few hours every day
	is no problem either, but then you would most likely
	have backup MX server, and issue an ETRN request for
	your domain there when you reconnect.

	Mike.   Don't suggest something of which you apparently
	know nothing about.
