Hello,
I think this behavior is different on different platforms, you can
find some clues
in man page of execve(2):
       The  semantics  of  the  optional-arg argument of an interpreter script
       vary across implementations.  On Linux, the entire string following the
       interpreter name is passed as a single argument to the interpreter, and
       this string can include white space.  However, behavior differs on some
       other  systems.   Some  systems  use the first white space to terminate
       optional-arg.  On some systems, an interpreter script can have multiple
       arguments,  and  white  spaces  in optional-arg are used to delimit the
       arguments
It seems that POSIX doesn't specify this.
Thanks.
