  I happened to be playing with 2.4.0-test6 on my laptop last night
and your email caught my eye.  For me, test6 wasn't totally broken.
There does seem to be a mandatory 60-SECOND DELAY starting up any
network connection though (even myself, external IP or loopback).
Once the connection starts up (SSH, pinging some box, etc) it stays up
and seems fine so far.
  In my case, I'm using the kernel pcmcia modules and a slightly patched
version of xirc2ps_cs.o out of pcmcia-cs-3.1.17.
  [#define enet_statistics net_device_stats]
  This kernel was installed on a base system that is also running
vmlinux-2.2.17pre15 where pcmcia-cs compiled cleanly and was fully
installed, so I'm sure there is some amount of fudge going on here.

  I'll have to look into those.
