Subject: How do I stop make building all modules after reboot?

Quick question as above. I'm building an i2c module. If I don't reboot
the machine "make modules" works as expected and just recompiles my  
changes.
After a reboot I have to wait 1 hour + (two smp P3 866s) while all modules  
are built. I've had a look in the Makefile but can't spot the dependancy.
TIA
Bill
