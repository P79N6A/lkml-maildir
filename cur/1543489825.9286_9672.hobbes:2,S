Hi Alan,
thank you for your help! Sometimes I am so close to the 
solution I just can't see it.
Excuse me, I better have read the help and documentation 
before... But I am very happy, the upgraded 2.2.0 
(up to .3) works, so that I can use it for my SMP-machines 
at work to get (I hope) more performance at database-tasks.
Another question. I followed the "NFS-bug-dicussion" Ramon 
started and I think they are talking about a problem 
related to SUN-machines. Am I right? Or is there a problem
with Intel-based machines, too?
(I remember such a problem with our HP-machines at work)
Greetings, Dietmar
