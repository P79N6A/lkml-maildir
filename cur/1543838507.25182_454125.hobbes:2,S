Thanks for doing this, David.  FWIW, for XFS its not directly a problem
today, we simply block attempts to mount filesystems on 32 bit systems
where the inums could get into the problematic ranges.  With several XFS
changes (main change will be switching to use iget5_locked) we will be
able to allow those mounts to go ahead - so, thanks again!
cheers.
