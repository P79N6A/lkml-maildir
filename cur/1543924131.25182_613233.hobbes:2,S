Just a heads up...
I have started to redo the patch below in smaller chunks and expect
to finish this tomorrow.
The cpufreq Kconfig file is done so no need for help here.
I hope to make the patches small enough so we can be confident to
apply them despite that we are heading -rc2.
It would be nice to get "make ARCH=x86" working before next
kernel release - and with the Kconfig files merged this is trivial.
I hope the x86 maintainers agree - but that yours decision.
