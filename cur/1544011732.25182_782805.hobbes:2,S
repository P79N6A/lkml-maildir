Hi Andrew,
I agree.  These are integration issues and I will test better next time.
There were two such bugs which Ingo fixed in the tip.

    sched: fix warning in kernel/sched.c
    Impact: fix cpumask conversion bug
    this warning:
      kernel/sched.c: In function find_busiest_group:
      kernel/sched.c:3429: warning: passing argument 1 of __first_cpu from incompatible pointer type
    shows that we forgot to convert a new patch to the new cpumask APIs.

    sched: move test_sd_parent() to an SMP section of sched.h
    Impact: build fix

I have tested the sched-tip with these fixes.

Yes this is my code bug.  I did not see the warning in sched.c.  Is
there any build option that I need to pass in order to get -Wall
effect?
Here is the fix to initialise the active_balance=0.
Thanks for the detailed review.  I will work to improve the quality of
my submission.

    sched: bug fix -- initialise active_balance variable
    In sched.c load_balance_newidle, potential use of uninitialised
    variable.
