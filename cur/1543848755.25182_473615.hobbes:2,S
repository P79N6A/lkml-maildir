It looks as if node 0 is allready full on bootup. The new code in 2.6.19 
controls locality in a more strict form in the slab. 2.6.18 and earlier 
were able to tolerate if a request for a page from the slab allocator for 
node 0 returns memory on node1 even if node 1 has not been bootstrapped 
yet. But this resulted in a problem in the slab because the node lists 
dedicated for node 0 now had memory from node 1 in it (which led to 
latency problems since slab code subsequently assumes that node local 
memory is very fast, which with corrupted per node lists is no longer 
true.).
You must bootstrap on a node that has memory available. If you would 
bootstrap the slab on node 1 that would work.

^^^^^ This node should not be full!!!
Increase memory on node 0 so that the slab can bootstrap.
