Subject: PATHC: SHM mappings beyond the end of a segment.

Currently it is possible to extend the vma for a shm segment
with mremap.  The shm code has no checks for access beyond the
end of the shm segment.  Resulting in writes to shp->shm_dir in 2.3
and shp->shm_pages in 2.2 past the allocated end of the array.
By playing with this processes can create weird memory overwrites,
and effectively mlocked private pages.
As using mremap to extend a shm mapping is basically silly,
and linux specific.  I don't think it affects anything in practice.
The attached patch caused SIGBUS to be delivered when
we write past the end of our shm area.
