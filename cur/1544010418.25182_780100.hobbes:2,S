Okay.  I do mention tags.  How they're stored in the database is irrelevant.
As far as most users need be concerned, a tag is a symbolic representation of
a particular commit in the tree; a particular state of the source tree.
Think of symbolic links as an analogy.  Most users just need to know that a
symlink represents the location of another part of the VFS tree; actually most
users will just think of them as a pointer to the name of a file, if even that
much.  The fact that, say, ReiserFS tail packs them because they tend to be
small, or that AFS symlinks have weird properties that encode mountpoints is
irrelevant to most users.  You don't need to know that to use them.
Yes, GIT's database has blob objects, tree objects, commit objects and tag
objects; but as far as the normal user is concerned, it stores files, lists of
files (directories or, more probably, folders), commits and tags.  The
physical low-level stuff is completely irrelevant.
There is one exception to that: commit IDs.  These are public-facing as it
were.  GIT waves them in your face, and you have to use them occasionally, so
it's useful to say a bit about them.
