Fix this sparse warning:
  drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_fb.c:417:5: warning: symbol 'intelfb_panic' was not declared. Should it be static?

Ok, so let's make the function static and there is no need to EXPORT
it, which wouldn't work for a static function anyway.
When is it safe to un-EXPORT a function?  When it is only referenced
within the translation unit it is defined in?  But it could be
referenced from outside the kernel source, or?
