I think you're approaching a solution Linus. If developers take a refusal
as a punishment, maybe you can use that for trees which have too many
unresolved regressions. This would be really unfair to subsystem maintainers
which themselves merge a lot of work, but recursively they may apply the
same principle to their own developers, so that everybody knows that it's
not worth working on next code past a point where too many regressions are
reported.
