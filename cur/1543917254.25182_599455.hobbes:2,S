Changing Linux behavior would violate the POSIX and SuSV2
specifications; the standards explicitly state that the working
directory will NOT change.  And standards adherance is important; we
break them only if we have a d*mn good reason.  And trying to make
chroot() something which it is not (i.e., a secure jail) is certainly
not a good enough reason.
Can we please end this thread now?  And can we put in a Kernel FAQ
saying that this is not something which is NOT up for discussion?
