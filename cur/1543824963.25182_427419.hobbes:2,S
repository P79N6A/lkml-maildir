Where did that rule come from?  We should call update_mmu_cache() even
if the PTE was not present before, look at the fault path in
mm/memory.c, it does this too.
This is where we install hash table entries for newly installed
mappings on sparc64 and powerpc, so this update_mmu_cache() call
is important even for not-previously-present mappings.
