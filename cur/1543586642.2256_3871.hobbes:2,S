Exactly.  If a given task has run on a particular nodes for a while,
its memory will tend to be allocated on that node.  So preferentially
running it on another CPU on that same node should get you better
memory latency than would running it on some other node's CPUs.
In addition, continuing to run the task on a particular node means
that more of that task's memory is from that node, which again means
good memory latency.  In contrast, if you move a task back and forth
between nodes, it can end up with its memory spread over many nodes,
which means that it does not get good memory latency no matter where
you run it.
                              Thanx, Paul
