this was a 4k block partition. I am thinking of making a md (striping)
partition out of it, will this help? Or is reiserfs or lvd better in this
respect?

hm. Can this be done in the background with low priority? I do all rm'ing
with "&" by now, but can this be automated?

well, I think its a little too early to start thinking about 2.3 - we
haven't even got everyone addicted to 2.2 yet :)
Well, are projects like the LVM or reiserfs (or md, for that matter) stable
enough to try on 'production-like' machines? This one is a LAN server for
the home LAN and a desktop workstation for my personal use.
