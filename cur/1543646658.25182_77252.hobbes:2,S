Hello!
While running make menuconfig on a 2.5.40 kernel (constructed from stock 
2.5.31 + stock patches) I received an immediate crash and exit while trying 
to enter Sound --> Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.
The error reported was :
Q> ./scripts/Menuconfig: MCmenu74: command not found
I am just reporting this as advised in the crash report --
Best wishes, Peter Keller.
