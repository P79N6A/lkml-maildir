Thanks, but could you wait a couple of days? We use these
machines for numbercrunching and some timeconsuming jobs are
running which I dont want to kill (that's why it's still not
rebooted despite this problem...) Since we don't want frequent
reboots I don't generally try pre-patch kernels, but I'm
willing to give this one a try. But if 2.2.7 is close by
I'd prefer to run that.
Also, I can tell you whether or not the machine crashes, but
not whether the patch works :) not for another 48 days at
least...
