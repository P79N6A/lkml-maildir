When the data is queued in the receive_queue of the socket. The kernel
consumes it from tcp_recvmsg().

If you steal packets before tcp_recvmsg you have to do some of its work, mainly
the ack management done in cleanup_rbuf(). You could skb_clone() the packet
though and queue to some other socket (similar to how raw sockets are
implemented in ip_input.c)

Tapping the data via packet or raw sockets (you'll need to implement your
own reassembly then)
Using shared memory in user space to distribute the data to all consumers.
That is probably the best way.
