Perhaps the following is correct?
    By contrast, ext3 in data=journal and data=ordered modes only guarantees the atomicity of a single write 
that does not span a page boundary, and it guarantees that its internal 
metadata will not be corrupted even if your application's data is 
corrupted after the crash (due to the application spreading what should be committed atomically across more than one block).
