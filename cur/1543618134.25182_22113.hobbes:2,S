It's because your system is behaving wrongly for your dream to come true. If 
your want to handle several expected inputs from IO, you should ask it for an 
interrupt for every package. Rather you should rely on a timer function an 
periodically handle new data and in case of nothing new, go back to 
interrupts..
Eager scheduling is OPTIMAL for the sematics in your system. It thats is not 
optimal for throughput/whatever, it's the code that is wrong!
