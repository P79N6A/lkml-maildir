X niced to -10 makes the xmms mouse-jerkyness disappear. but it can
still skip right after a songchange. If I renice xmms to -10 as well I
get the mouse-jerkyness again, it I renice it to -5 it seems to behave
quite well, no mouse-jerkyness and so far I havn't heard any skips, but
it can take some time until a skip occurs.
With X reniced to -10 it feels like the wiggle_a_window while a
'make -j10' and a movie is playing gets a bit more sluggish.
And sawfish still takes 30 second naps when executing a bunch of
aumix's.

Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level, then beat you with experience.
