I would suggest to just use C for this. I do this on x86-64 and 
I don't think there is any reason to use this hard to maintain
code for it.
It's probably a left over from Linus first experiments with inline
assembly, similar to the old string.h and by now so obsolete
it doesn't even stink anymore.
