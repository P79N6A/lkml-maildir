i don't have an old ksymoops binary :) it just did not want to
compile until i removed the old binutils, and installed the new
version.
just to be sure, i removed the source dir for ksymoops, unpacked it
again, recompiled, and ran it from thre. same result.
i think i'll just let it rest, and give it another go next time i get
an oops :) so far my box seems to be running as i expect it to run,
so i won't worry too much about it.
unless one of the developers really needs it :)
best regards,
Jurgen.
