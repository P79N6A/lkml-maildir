There isn't one.  Such things cause way too much email.
What complete_all() does is to permit more than one task to wait on a
completion and for all those tasks to be woken by a single complete(). 
Without it you'd need to record how many tasks are sleeping there and do
complete() that many times.
So it's a sensible part of the completion API from a regularity-of-the-API
POV.  We use it in the coredump code and I don't think we'd be likely to want
to rip it out.
In fact, I'd say that complete() should have always done it this way...
