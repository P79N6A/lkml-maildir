PLEASE fix your mailer, the world uses '\n' after every 79 characters
or so, even though M$ invented the "screen-warp-around-technique".
The error is probably caused by the dynamic loader getting corrupt
or loaded incorrectly, either because of a disk error or because of
bad RAM. You probably see this immediately after init starts. It
is also possible for /etc/ld.so.cache to get corrupt and cause this.
To fix that, you could use `nash` or some statically-linked program
in place of init and then execute `ldconfig` after mv-ing /etc/ld.so.cache
out of the way.
Cheers,
