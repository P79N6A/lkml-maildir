How did I try it, or how no joy?  ;)
On the former, I didn't run any really exhaustive tests, and Alan
didn't suggest using or avoiding certain options.  I built a relatively
conservative kernel and then beat on all four drives with concurrent dd's.
I also did an hdparm -tT.  hdparm killed the box in a matter of a second
or two.  dd took about 30 seconds.  It seems safe to assume that hdparm
is able to create a higher load.
On the latter, the box just freezes up solid.  No magic SysRq, no nothing.
A very frustrating state to try and troubleshoot.  Any suggestions?
