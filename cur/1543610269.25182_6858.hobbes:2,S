OK.  Cool.  Now we are making progress.  I think this is a nasty problem.
There
are numerous RPMs that will build against the kernel tree and be busted.  I
would
expect an rpm -ba on your DEFAULT kernel in Redhat with the sources
contained
in the kernel.rpm files to also be broken unless someone has done this.  You
probably should have someone check this out.  I just built the SCI drivers
against
2.4.15-pre7 and they blow up as well.
