Hi,
I have installed the SLES8.0 on a LX50 server. The installation went
fine. While coming up the kernel panics with the below message.
kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 08:03
I have tried the workaround by give mem=2048M for boot options . This
does not work and give the same problem.
Can anyone of you throw light on this?
Your help is highly appreciated.
