Is the vendor ID 015A allocated to anything? If not, we could use
that to indicate ISA devices - it resembles ISA as a number, and
would thus be easier to identify. We could then use the product
number to identify the particular product. For example..
	015A:2000	NE 2000 clone card.
	015A:3509	3COM 3C509
...with other numbers allocated in a similar way. There may be some
duplication as the above allows 65,536 discrete ISA Bus products,
but that shouldn't matter providing we allocate unique product ID's
for each product actually installed on a particular system.
Alternatively, if it's free, we could use 15Ay:xxxx to allow for up
to 1,048,576 products, with ID's like the following...
	15Ay:2000	NE 2000 clone card.
	15Ay:3509	3COM 3C509
...with the 'y' digit used to allow up to 16 different products with
any given product ID, incremented by the kernel as required.
Best wishes from Riley.
