I see.  CONFIG_HIBERNATION && CONFIG_ACPI -> CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP
and the Makefile in arch/x86/kernel/acpi/ wants to build wakeup.S, which is
not necessary.  Hmm.
We can do a couple of things:
(1) make wakeup_$(BITS).o depend on CONFIG_SUSPEND (alone)
    This will build it if CONFIG_SUSPEND is set, but CONFIG_ACPI is not
    (still, that's consistent with the change in question).
(2) make wakeup_$(BITS).o depend on CONFIG_SUSPEND and CONFIG_ACPI
(3) define CONFIG_ACPI_SUSPEND depending on ACPI and SUSPEND and
    make wakeup_$(BITS).o as well as swsusp_pg_dir depend on that (most
    elegant)
Which one do you prefer?
In case you choose (3), please drop the patch and I'll send a new one to Len.
Thanks,
Rafael
