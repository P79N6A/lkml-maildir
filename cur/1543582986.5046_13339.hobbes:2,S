I have my home directory mounted on one computer from another.  I
rebooted the server and now the client is saying Stale NFS file handle
anytime something goes to read my home directory.  It has been this  
way for about a day.  Shouldn't any caches expire by now?
Both server and client are running 2.4.2.
I'ved tried `mount /home -o remount`, and reading lots of other
directories to flush out that entry if it was in cache without any
results.
I was hopping to avoid unmounting, as I would have to shut about
everything down to do that.
