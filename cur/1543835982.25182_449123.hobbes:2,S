I had problems getting blktrace going and posted a note to 
linux-btrace@vger.kernel.org at Alan Brunelle's suggestion and he also 
said he'd take a closer look at it himself.  On the other hand he 
pointed me to 'stap' and I was able to use it to get the details I was 
looking for - SystemTAP really rocks for this type of analysis!  As it 
turns out my assumption about driver blocksize was wrong (sorry about 
that).  It turns out that the size of requests from the driver to the 
disk is 160mb and so the I/O count was smaller than I had anticipated.
