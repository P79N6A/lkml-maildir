I think that's the closest you have ever come to saying fragmentation
avoidance is not a terrible idea :)

Regular Joe is not going to be creating a filesystem with large blocks or
overly concerned with saturating all the disks hanging off his RAID array.
At most, he'll care about faster DVD writing and considering the number and
duration of those allocations, the system will be able to handle it. So I
don't think Regular Joe will generally care.

I cannot speak with authority on what IO controllers are really capable
of so maybe someone else will comment on this more.
