Hi!.
When I execute "modprobe ppa" while running a kernel 2.2.19, my computer
hangs completely. No messages. System request key does not work.
The kernel configuration is the same in both 2.2.17 and 2.2.19.
Perhaps, the problem is not in the ppa module, but in the parport,
parport_pc or parport_probe modules.
Bye!
