It's not hard to see that that's a mistake. The great thing about virtual
deadline schedulers, though, is that all it takes to completely rewrite
the policy is changing the numbers calculated for these things.

It's not just more understandable, it doesn't break down with
increasing numbers of tasks.

I'm not convinced this is a great way to mitigate context switch
overhead. I'd recommend heuristically adjusting the latency parameters
(l_i) to try to mitigate context switch overhead or otherwise express
the tradeoff between latency and throughput instead of introducing an
arbitrary delay like sched_granularity_ns. I suspect it'll have to
restart from a point much closer to EEVDF for that to be effective.
