This is a real loss for all of us, and for me personally.  I knew Rich 
reasonably well since both of us are avid troff fans and traded tricks
and tools quite a bit over the years (though I must admit he taught me
quite a bit more than I ever taught him).
It's a real shame, he was a great guy and did a wonderful service for
the world of computer science by taking the time to write down what we
all wanted to write but never did.
I urge you, if you cared about Rich or his work, to send donations in
his name, as his family has requested, to
    Habitat for Humanity, 2950 E. 22nd Street, Tucson, AZ 85713 
And take a moment to remember him, he did a lot for all of us.
