This is something that I've thought of doing in the past. The reason I
didn't pursue it further is that it's impossible to get it right for
all cases, and it attacks the problem in the wrong place. The kernel
shouldn't need to guess(timate) what the process is going to do. The
userspace programmer, who knows what his process is going to do,
should tell the kernel.
