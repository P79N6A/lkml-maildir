Subject: 2.4.20pre10 compile fails to link  init_rootfs if CONFIG_RAMFS != y
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Subject line says it all:
This needs fixing in linux-2.4.20pre*: 
--   a function in fs/namespace.c calls init_rootfs(),
--   This is declared as "extern void init_rootfs(void)" in fs/namespace.c,
     But " __init int init_rootfs(void)" *only* occurs
     in fs/ramfs/inode.c, and is not compiled unless CONFIG_RAMFS=y.
     If CONFIG_RAMFS !=y, "make fs" fails (can't link init_rootfs).
Who should this report go to?
(I found that this was already briefly alluded to
on this list a few months ago, but seems to have been ignored....)
