I know I have a copy backed up, but I'm rather disorganized at the 
moment, having moved two out-of-town offices into this one, after 
spending 12 years on a ten week contract... but I doubt you want it, 
it's slow as hell and violates all manner of patents. Mind you, I think 
the patents are held by IBM, so they might be negotiable, but I think 
the original is dead. Used either fractal or arithmetic compression IIRC.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
