Nice to see that imitation was good enough ;-) Seriously, I half-expected
Albert to show up at that point of thread and tried to anticipate what
he'd produce.
ObProcfs: I don't think that walking the page tables is a good way to
compute RSS, especially since VM maintains the thing. Mind if I rip
it out? In effect, implementation of /prc/<pid>/statm
	* produces extremely bogus values (VMA is from library if it goes
	  beyond 0x60000000? Might be even true 7 years ago...) and nobody
	  had cared about them for 6-7 years
	* makes stuff like top(1) _walk_ _whole_ _page_ _tables_ _of_ _all_
	  _processes_ each 5 seconds. No wonder it's slow like hell and eats
	  tons of CPU time.
