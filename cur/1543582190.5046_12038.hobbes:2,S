Basically it boils down to this.. By continuing this thread here,
I'm preaching to the choir, and I'd rather not waste my time on
those with no clue of the open source movement.  The other
alterative is to stick up for open source, and debate you until
I'm blue in the face - and you wont change your mind anyways,
and considering you're the minority here.. who cares?
