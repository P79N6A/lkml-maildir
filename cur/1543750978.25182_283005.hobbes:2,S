This must be considered relative to the size of the source code.
Just because they're more changes than you can personally track does
not mean they're large numbers of changes relative to the source's size.
Users' timidity in these regards should be taken as little more than
a sign that the scale of the kernel's source is increasing, which is a
good thing, as the kernel may then benefit from economies of scale.
The kernel's scale has long since increased beyond the point where an
individual can effectively track its changes in realtime, and small
matters of degree such as are being moaned about now are insubstantial.
Similarly, counts of bugs and regressions should probably also be
considered relative to the size of the kernel source.

The existences of badly-behaved filesystems and drivers were known in
advance, and that's why 4KB stacks were left optional. So the example
is not particularly enlightening.
This is trivially countered with the source code skew that crippled
numerous architectures, made numerous drivers uncompilable or
unrunnable and the like over the course of the "unstable series". Had
the attention of users of the stable series been present, no such
phenomena would have occurred.
The issues you're dredging up are pinpricks at most. The losses
incurred from the fragmentation of the userbase are far more severe,
dwarfing those by numerous orders of magnitude.

PEBKAC is entirely out of the scope of any program not making direct
efforts at HCI. CONFIG_BLK_DEV_UB was documented for what it was, and
users configuring kernels are not assumed to be naive.
