/*SLINT some_preconditions*/
while (complicated_condition()) complicated_calculation();
/*SLINT some postconditions*/
might well be something the lint cannot prove works. Say what you're doing  
here is applying some complicated mathematical theorem; the lint doesn't  
know about that theorem and cannot prove it, because that'd be the halting  
problem.
It can, however, verify the rest of the program and tell you that all's  
fine except for these lines, where it can't prove the postconditions from  
the preconditions.
This should be enough in praxis. And for testing, you can often add an  
assertion.
