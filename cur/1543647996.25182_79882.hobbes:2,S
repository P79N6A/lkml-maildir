UML has been updated to 2.5.42 and UML 2.4.19-12.  In non-numeric terms,
this means the following:
	the usual build fixes to keep up with kbuild
	the SMP work from UML 2.4.19-12 - it seems reasonably functional
and stable, but there are some unexplained crashes still.  Also, the fixes
from UML 2.4.19-13 aren't in yet, so an SMP UML will leave children around
after exiting (the idle threads for processors 1 ... ncpus - 1).  These 
children will interfere with rebooting, and will also hold down host memory.
	various cleanups and bug fixes
The patch is available at
