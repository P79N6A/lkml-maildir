Sorry, I forgot to answer your question - 
the reason why you are seeing them on some, but not all, machines means
that some machines are configured with framebuffer support and some are
not. This choice is made during kernel configuration/compilation. Refer to
the nearest kernel-howto document for more info on how to compile the
kernel.
