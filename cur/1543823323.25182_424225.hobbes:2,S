Hi Len,
The problem does not exist, if I boot my PC and then
halt it immediately. If I login and use it for some
time, then acpi_power_off does not work.
Box 'X' is an Aopen MZ-915M, CPU is a 2 GHz Pentium
M. It is running Debian Sid, kernel is vanilla
Linux bugs 2.6.17-rc4 #1 PREEMPT Sat May 13 16:22:54 CEST 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
Old kernels don't work on this PC due to missing
hardware support. The first vanilla kernel that worked
reliably on this box (except for acpi_power_off) was 2.6.16.
Regards
Harri
