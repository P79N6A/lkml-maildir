Unfortunately it won't be me, while I'm able to formulate a concept my
knowledge of Linux is too limited to do much work. Also I've lot of
other work as you might have seen in my signature. But I encurrage
anyone with more insight of Linux file systems to have a look if such a
concept can be implemented.
