Quite a lot of linux distributions allow you to install linux with a
couple of floppies and an FTP server. I know both Debian and SuSE can
work that way because I tried it myself. See:
  
http://www.debian.org/
  
http://www.suse.com/
 or 
http://www.suse.de/en/
I'm quite sure the other distributions also support install via FTP.
