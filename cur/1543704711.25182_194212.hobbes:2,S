cs46xx doesn't always support the direct hardware buffer.
Only in some cases with a proper period (fragment) numbers, it can
support the direct buffer access.  mmap_valid option forces the driver
to allow OSS apps the direct accessing via mmap.  This might not work
always, depending on the parameter the app uses.  Use at your own
risk.
In short: it's not a real bug as long as mmap_valid=1 option works.
You had luck that your OSS apps (using mmap) seem working :)
