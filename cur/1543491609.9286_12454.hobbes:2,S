Um...  Is it correct?  I thought there was some rule about multiple 
assignments to the same lvalue between sequence points.
I believe there is a sequence point after the evaluation of the lhs of 
the ?: operator, but I don't know about after the evaluation of the rhs.
The expression may be undefined.
I can't think of any reasonable interpretation that would yield 2, 
however...
(Is : alone an operator?  Somewhere I remember it being a bitfield or 
strange scoping operator.  In that case, it may be interpreting it as
 x = ((y) ? (x = ((1:x) = 2)));
which I could see interpreted as 2, in some bizzare sense.)

This makes it sound like some evaluation order misunderstanding.
