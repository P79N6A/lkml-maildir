I've implemented the clear_irq() function to clear all interrupts as you 
said, but haven't had time to test this thoroughly.  Ultimately, we 
don't know if it works until we experience real errors and see how the 
system responds.
I don't think it matters in which order you do things, as long as you 
allow for the fact that reading PORT_SLOT_STAT will clear the command 
completion interrupt flag.
