Is this what the two of you are getting at?
#define DEFINE_SRCU_STRUCT(name) \
	DEFINE_PER_CPU(struct srcu_struct_array, name) = { 0, 0 }; \
	struct srcu_struct name = { \
		.completed = 0, \
		.per_cpu_ref = NULL, \
		.mutex = __MUTEX_INITIALIZER(name.mutex) \
	}
#define srcu_read_lock(ss) \
	({ \
		if ((ss)->per_cpu_ref != NULL) \
			srcu_read_lock_dynamic(&ss); \
		else { \
			int ret; \
			\
			preempt_disable(); \
			ret = srcu_read_lock_static(&ss, &__get_cpu_var(ss)); \
			preempt_enable(); \
			ret; \
		} \
	})
int srcu_read_lock_dynamic(struct srcu_struct *sp)
{
	int idx;
	preempt_disable();
	idx = sp->completed & 0x1;
	barrier();  /* ensure compiler looks -once- at sp->completed. */
	per_cpu_ptr(sp->per_cpu_ref, smp_processor_id())->c[idx]++;
	srcu_barrier();  /* ensure compiler won't misorder critical section. */
	preempt_enable();
	return idx;
}
int srcu_read_lock_static(struct srcu_struct *sp, srcu_struct_array *cp)
{
	int idx;
	idx = sp->completed & 0x1;
	barrier();  /* ensure compiler looks -once- at sp->completed. */
	cp->c[idx]++;
	srcu_barrier();  /* ensure compiler won't misorder critical section. */
	return idx;
}
And similarly for srcu_read_unlock()?
I sure hope that there is a better way!!!  For one thing, you cannot pass
a pointer in to srcu_read_lock(), since __get_cpu_var's name mangling would
fail in that case...
							Thanx, Paul
