You don't even need special tools: just change your code that says:
	foo = write(fd, mybuf, mycount);
to say (for example):
	foo = write(fd, mybuf, mycount / randomly_either_1_or_2);
Why would this need kernel support?  The average developer doesn't
really need to verify that the *kernel* works.  They just need to test
their own code paths - and in this case, they can see that foo is less
than mycount (sometimes).  The code paths don't care that it was not the
kernel that caused it.
