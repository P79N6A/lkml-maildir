Yes, I noted this also while reviewing patches.  fb_find_mode() is used
predominantly with the 'generic' modedb which contains modes that are
not specific to the card or monitor.  And fb_try_mode() is not a
guarantee that the returned refresh rate will be safe (we have a lot of
drivers that do not check the timings against the display capabilities).
It would be best that fb_find_mode() return the safest refresh rate
(60Hz) instead of the highest.
