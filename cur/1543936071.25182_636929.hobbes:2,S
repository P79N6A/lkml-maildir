(Added Bob Picco to the mail, as he was involved in the ia64 clocksource
work).
So the background on the patch is this:
Some clocksources wrap frequently (every few seconds, for example). This
can cause issues if we defer the update_wall_time() function where we
accumulate time for too long (this really only happens on -rt systems
right now). 
To avoid that issue, we've added the cycle_accumulated value, which acts
as a midpoint, where we can quickly accumulate cycles off of the
counter, without doing the more expensive update_wall_time() function.
This avoids issues with the clocksource wrapping, but requires that
cycle_accumulated be added in to the gettiemofday() calculation.
If you noticed in my email, the fix for ppc was a bit easier, as it has
only a 64bit counter that is quite unlikely to wrap twice between calls
to update_wall_time(). There we could decrement the cycles_last value by
cycles_accumulated and get the same effect of adding it in.
Unfortunately on ia64, I suspect it will be necessary to do similar to
the x86_64 code and add in the cycles accumulated value in
vgettime/fgettime function, since there is the possibility of quickly
wrapping clocksources on that architecture. 
So unless someone can point out a nicer trick, it likely means adding a
new cycles_accumulated value to the fsyscall structure and the asm to do
the addition. :(
