Sounds like a marketing thing.
Not really an excuse imo. The "Oh, K6-4. I must upgrade" brigade would've
justified the name for more than confusing people. At least K6-2+
is mostly used in laptops from what I've seen, so the confusion is
limited.
Maybe there just wasn't enough architectural difference between the
K6-3 & the K6-2+ to justify calling it the K6-4. AFAIR, the powersaving
speed changing is the only thing thats changed.
I'm buying a K6-2+ laptop tomorrow, so I guess I'll find out more then :)
