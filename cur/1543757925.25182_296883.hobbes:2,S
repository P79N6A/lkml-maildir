Hi Paul,
I think the microbenchmarking your link provides is irrelevant.
Your link provides benchmarking of doing a fork.
However, we are talking about inserting a callback routine
in a fork and/or an exit. The overhead is a function
call and time spent in the routine. The callback routine
can be configured to "do {} while (0)" if a certain CONFIG
flag is not set.
Thanks,
