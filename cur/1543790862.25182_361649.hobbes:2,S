Dave,
This is a slightly modified patch I used on x86_64 for EXTREME testing. The
original 2.6.13-rc1-mhp1 patch didn't apply cleanly against 2.6.14. It will 
apply with this untested patch.  The patch needs to have arch_sparse_init
which is only active for SPARSEMEM. This patch was just for testing EXTREME 
on x86_64 NUMA and needs review.
I think the bootmem allocator is being used before initialized.  This wouldn't
have happened before SPARSEMEM_EXTREME became the default.
If you feel my analysis is correct, I'll generate a cleaner patch and
test on my 4 way.
