[I am subscribed to both lists, so don't bother cc-ing me]
I've got a hang several times that I think may be USB related.
I've run into this hang 3 times now, the last 2 were on 2.3.49 and
2.3.51 (forgot which I was running for the first one). I haven't
reproduced the hang on 2.2.14 with the 2.3.47 USB backport (I
haven't built and booted a later backport yet).
I am running on a BP6 dual Celeron (no overclocking) with the latest
QQ bios. EIDE-33 drives only (no SCSI). All the kernels are compiled
with and using devfs. A tulip-based ethernet card is in use, and I
have a Trident-based sound card using ALSA drivers, but it's not
working... I have 2 copies of setiathome niced in the background.
A USB mouse (Evolution Trackball) is the only USB device, and I was
mousing around in X when the hang happens. The hang actually happens
on a left-mouse click. I can tell because I have xfishtank running
as the background with fvwm2 window manager.
After the hang, there is no response to ping, and various alt-sysrq
hang after printing the first message (to serial console, or I
wouldn't see them at all).
A few seconds after the hang, I get the following message on the
serial console (this is 2.3.51):
wait_on_irq, CPU 0:
irq:  1 [ 0 1 ]
bh:   1 [ 1 1 ]

running it through ksymoops I get (not much use I know, but it's all
I have):
