It's sufficiently true if 90% of the cards plugged into the machine
are covered by 3 or 4 drivers. The remaining 10% can use IO port space
and everything will work fine.

After we (OS developers) have been telling firmware people to NOT
configure every device and run it's BIOS driver at power up?
OS "hotplug" now deals with resource assignment and device initialization
in most cases on these boxes. Running the BIOS/EFI driver to configure
each device just takes too long.
