This is not a new problem - these cards have done this or something
like it for as long as I've had them*. They work just fine in 100 MBit
mode but not in all of my machines, and in none of them at gig-e.
I've tried every version of the driver since SUSE 9.1 without much
luck (at least as far back as 2.6.9). I'd try a newer driver, esp. if
I could make it compile on 2.6.22.12 (I prefer but do not require to
stay with the stock distro kernel, modules notwithstanding).
NOTE: to avoid list noise, I can make a bug out of this on
bugzilla.kernel.org and we can proceed from there if that is
preferred.
[*] Actually, they worked OK in 2.4.something way-back-when but only
for short durations at gig-e speeds.
