   It would be much more useful to make it possible for SIGNMEM to be
caught. This would be similiar to low memory handlers as seen on AmigaOS.
Programs could then register a signal handler for SIGNMEM and free up
memory that isn't needed when the signal handler is caught. Some programs
cache reconstructable data for speed reasons and some daemons keep idle
children running to save fork()/exit() overhead.
   Just wondering: Linux isn't smart enough to unload unused modules in low
memory situations, is it?
