If you look at how /dev/epoll does it, the collapsing of readiness 
events is very elegant: a given fd is only allowed to report a change 
in its state once per run through the event loop.  The ioctl that swaps 
event buffers acts as a barrier between the two possible reports.
As to how this would interact with the aio event loops, I thought the 
"barrier" syscall could be the point at which aio event slots are reserved 
and freed.  Interest registration would be the other syscall (which would 
naturally have to reserve an event for the descriptor in the current set 
of readiness notifications).  Anyways, just a few thoughts...
