HM. Does not malloc return NULL if it's out of memory now ?

Well. Malloc of couse has to return null if there is no more memory left.
The problem is if the memory will be out and so no process will be able to
allocate memory the system will not halt but will become unusable as even to
login you need memory.
At list the thing should be done I think is the memory reserved for root
usage only. So we'll have a possibility to at least login and kill bad task.
