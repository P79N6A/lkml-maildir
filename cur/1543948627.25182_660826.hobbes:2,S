lspci says Apple Computer Inc. UniNorth 2 FireWire (rev 81), pci id 106b:0031, 
subsys id 106b:5811.
(Its a circa 2004 Aluminum 15" PowerBook G4 @ 1.67GHz, fwiw).

Under Mac OS X, system.log says "FireWire (OHCI) Apple ID 31 built-in now 
active". Could still be lucent though, judging by the subsys device ID of 
5811, which matches up w/the Lucent/Agere FW323. But no, apparently I don't 
have the interesting one.
