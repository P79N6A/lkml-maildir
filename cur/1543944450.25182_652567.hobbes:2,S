Huh? I never said that! Maybe I did not explain myself well, but that
was not what I was saying. I was simply saying that the good news about
Greg keeping 2.6.22.y open was that I'd throw my 2.6.20.y away and rely
on his tree instead.
I'm not really sure there's a need for 2.6.22 for a longer time. I did
that for 2.6.20 because .21 was crappy, people did not want to jump to
the fresh new 2.6.22 and it was unfair to expect Greg&Chris to maintain
3 versions in parallel, it's already cool to have two of them.
2.6.23.y looks very good to me, so I don't see what particular reason
people would have not to switch right now. But if there is a very good
reason (not motivated by unfixed regressions) and *if* it does not take
me too many hours a week, I'm not against this idea since I'm still
using 2.6.22 on some machines right now. But don't expect too many
releases though.
