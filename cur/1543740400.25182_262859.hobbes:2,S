Now, THIS is an excellent idea.  If the volumes there would be high 
enough, it could be what justifies the project.  We have had customers 
wanting embedded solutions, and through this project, we could provide 
them something even better in the future.

This is a good idea too.  I've already decided to try to fit it onto a 
1/2 height, short PCI card (like the low-end 3ware cards) so that you 
can put the card into one of these compact cases.
At this time, I'm not sure it's worth it to do anything other than PCI, 
AGP, and PCIE, however.  Of course, if someone comes along with a large 
enough order, we'd be plenty willing to do whatever customization they want.
Force of will isn't going to get this project done.  Money is what 
matters here.  <sigh>  :)
