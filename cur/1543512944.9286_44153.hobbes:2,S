ALSA already does this for cards that support multiple hardware
channels. For definate the Trident chipsets should work, though
I dont yet have one.
There was some talk on the ALSA list of having hardware mixing with
cards that allow it and fallback to alsa-lib userspace mixing if they
dont. No-one has yet placed any code for this sort of thing
yet though.
