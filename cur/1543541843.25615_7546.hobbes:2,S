Hi guys,
        I have a question for ya. I have just upgraded to X 4.0.1 and I
have a
Voodoo3 2000 agp the install went fine and X works well but now when I
switch back to a console or close X the console text is VERY light,
barely readable in fact. Its there just light. has anyone run across
this and does anyone know the fix? X was working fine before the upgrade
and everything is fine now except this one thing. I read something about
a fix posted by linus but didn't see it anywhere. Something about the
reset_palette. If this isn't the appropriate palce for this, my
apologies. I'm more of a lurker than a poster.
Other Info:
Machine: AMD K6-2 400MHz
         128Mb RAM
        ~100Mb swap
OS:      SuSE 6.2
Kernel: 2.4.0test5
btw. Linux rocks on xDSL! nothing like d/ling a new kernel in less than
a minute! *I think I'm gonna need a bigger HD :o)*
TIA,
        Dave
