Well, the usage of dma_supported() in usbnet.c is wrong even for i386.
USB device doesn't do DMA, it's USB controller what does. The driver should
check dma_mask of the parent device instead, something like this:
	// possible with some EHCI controllers
	if (*udev->dev->parent->dma_mask == 0xffffffffffffffffULL)
		net->features |= NETIF_F_HIGHDMA;
