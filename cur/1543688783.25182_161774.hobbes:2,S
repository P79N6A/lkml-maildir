Gracious renames to make sure I can not orient in the code :-(.
-/* do_magic() is implemented in arch/?/kernel/suspend_asm.S, and
basically does:

do_magic_suspend_1() did disable interrupts, where do you disable them
now?
Did you test it with CONFIG_PREEMPT to hunt for "scheduling in atomic"
bugs?
Your new naming is even worse than my original (and that's quite an
achievement).
swsusp_write() does
	swsusp_arch_suspend(), which in turn calls
		swsusp_suspend()
			^- and that does the writing.
			Ouch. do_magic_* was clearer than *that*.
I do not see why you had to change to BIOs just now. Perhaps you
should get it into stable state, first, and then adding more code to
make it look 2.6-like is good idea?
[Will add more comments after a test].
