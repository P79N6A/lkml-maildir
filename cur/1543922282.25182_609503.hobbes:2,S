I took a look at the DCCP references, and I think they're just
incrementing the wrong MIB variable -- e.g., it's incrementing
ICMP_MIB_INERRORS when the skb length is less than the
header indicates. That's not an ICMP_MIB_INERRORS error,
that's an IPSTATS_MIB_INHDRERRORS error. ICMP_MIB_INERRORS
is when you receive an ICMP error packet; an IP header error
is something else entirely.
That's followed by a failed lookup incrementing ICMP_MIB_INERRORS
which should be an unknown port error in the transport MIB (assuming
it has one-- it's not an ICMP error; could be an IP error, if the address
isn't local, rather than unknown port).
In SCTP, it appears to have similar problems. SCTP errors are not
ICMP errors, though it perhaps should be calling icmp_send() to
send one to the offending host for some of the cases.
I haven't seen any ICMP-relevant stats correctly referenced in
these yet.
I don't want to patch them directly, since I can't easily test them;
if someone who works with DCCP and SCTP would like to, I'd
be happy to review. Any volunteers?
