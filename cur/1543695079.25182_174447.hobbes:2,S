Please next time, take this kind of question to netdev@oss.sgi.com
where the networking developers are, most of them are not subscribed
to linux-kernel.
As to your question, if we ever support accepting data in the
initial final SYN-ACK packet, this code would be needed, so it's
better to keep this code around.
