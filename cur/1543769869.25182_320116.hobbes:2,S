Hello,
I have problem with my dvd+-r/rw driver in laptop. 
It's: (kernel 2.6.12-rc3)
hdb: TSSTcorpCD/DVDW TS-L532A, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
When I mount and umount any disk, then tray cannot be ejected using cdrom
button. Eject program works but it complains with errors:
hdb: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hdb: DMA disabled
hdb: ATAPI reset complete
hdb: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hdb: ATAPI reset complete
Is there something I could try? (Mainly to get cdrom eject button working)
