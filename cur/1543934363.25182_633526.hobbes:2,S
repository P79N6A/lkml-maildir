Most people and all distributions use CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL=y simply 
because too many options (including options required for hardware 
support) depend on it.
Compare e.g.:
- "Marvell SATA support (HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL)"
- "Provide NFSv4 client support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
- "Ext4dev/ext4 extended fs support development (EXPERIMENTAL)"
And I really do not have the impression that ext4 is ready for being 
used by people who cannot remove this depends line from a Kconfig file
in their kernel.
