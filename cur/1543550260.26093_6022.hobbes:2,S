My CD-RW is a Phillips CDD-3610.  I'm not sure who the person wanting
input from a Phillips user was so I hope that person is reading here.  I
got cdrecord working by NOT compiling in ATAPI CD ROM support, and by
compiling ide-scsi emulation as built-in rather than modular.  I have a
"regular" atapi cdrom and the above Phillips drive, both on the
secondary IDE interface.  the cdrom ends up at /dev/scd0 and the cdrw
ends up at /dev/scd1.
