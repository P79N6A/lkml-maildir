I have tried to reproduce this.  The circumstances weren't the most
controlled but they did overlap with what you described and I haven't seen
anything.
So I am guessing that you are having memory corruption from some source.
Either bad ram or a bad module.
I'm off on vacation for a week, so I won't be able to follow up.
