Geez , man I've corrected this statement already .. Why don't you quote
the corrections. Your not listening cause your ignoring everything I
said after this, and accepting only my first statement and rejecting
everything else.. Like you want this to descend into a melee .
Last and final correction. I'm saying drop the timer entry, which means
drop the call to request_irq() for irq0 . Add lines for lapic-timer
which take the place of LOC..
