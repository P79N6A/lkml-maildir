Patches weren't explicitly mentioned, but I'm assuming they're also
welcome ;-)
At first glance the register/unregister interface is a bit
unconventional, but I have a few trivial patches to get those fixed up,
which I'll send to you separately.
It looks like struct clocksource will also need suspend/resume ops,
since it's defining its own sysclass (so there's no overlap with the
timer sysclass that several other architectures setup to deal with this).
I haven't done that yet, but if there's interest, I'll hack something up.
