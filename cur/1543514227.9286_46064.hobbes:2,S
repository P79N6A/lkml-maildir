  Hi, all. I've just released version 1.2.6 of my devfsd (devfs
daemon) at: 
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
This works with devfs-patch-v130 (or later).
The main changes are:
- Incremented protocol revision to 5
- Added compatibility entries for SoundBlaster CD-ROM, netlink, SCSI
  generic and SCSI tape drivers.
				Regards,
					Richard....
