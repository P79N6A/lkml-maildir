Exactly where? bus 0, device 20, function 0 == hex(00:14.0)
Revision 48 = hex(30)
And both says that it's an Ethernet controller from 3Com. The fact that
the PCI-ID database in v2.2.18 isn't quite as extensive as the one in
lspci isn't something that makes your system malfunction...

That's probably because there is no simple way to query the processor for
this information. I'll let Peter Anvin answer this one, however.
