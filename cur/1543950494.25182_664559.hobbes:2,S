good catch Jan! The patch below should fix it.
Can you see any other material difference due to the unification? 
reboot_mode is now written to 0x472 unconditionally, but we can consider 
that a bugfix. Otherwise the mode and ordering of reboot sequences seems 
to be equivalent to me.

Subject: x86: re-add reboot fixups
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>

Jan Beulich noticed that the reboot fixups went missing during
reboot.c unification.
(commit 4d022e35fd7e07c522c7863fee6f07e53cf3fc14)
Geode and a few other rare boards with special reboot quirks are
affected.
