I don't think you should mention abuses like the selinux one, nor odd
projects that aren't merged.  Just make this a generic:
"The can be used for tracing or performance accounting"

It's trace_mark now.

I'm not sure this belong in here.  As we already have good example it's
probably not needed at all.

no need for this macro.

please call the loop variable i and use int for it.
