The hotplug handlers need udev. For example plugging in a new storage
device and expecting kernel support to get autoloaded for it.
If you have a fixed set of devices and have compiled in support for
all of them and made static device nodes, then you don't need it. But
in this case you don't need in-kernel naming support either.
