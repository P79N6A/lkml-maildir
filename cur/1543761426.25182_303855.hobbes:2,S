The buddy is calculated based on the position in the page struct array not
based on the list.

It will be able to manage the quicklist effectively and you can avoid
having to zero a page for pte/pmd/pud/pgds.
The main benefit from prezeroing is gained for programs that do numerical
calculations based on sparse matrices or other extremely large programs
that typically also come with large sparse arrays. The optimization is
typical for operating systems in that area (even M$ does that...).
