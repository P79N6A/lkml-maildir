I assume by "mapping" you mean "binding".  The rationale is simple: you
may want to grant normal, unprivileged users access to certain raw
devices, using normal filesystem permissions to control that access just
as you would do for any other device.  However, you certainly do _not_
want unprivileged users to be able to unbind or rebind a raw device to
which they have access, because that would be equivalent to letting them
open any arbitrary block device. 
For example, it would be a privileged operation to bind /dev/raw2 to
/dev/fd0, but you might then make /dev/raw2 accessible to any user in
the group "fd".  Opening /dev/raw2 should _not_ allow that user to
rebind it to /dev/sda and read the entire raw hard disk!
