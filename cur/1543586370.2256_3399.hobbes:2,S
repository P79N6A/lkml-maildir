Well, that certainly doesn't work for me (2.4.2-ac28, G400):
fbset -i:
mode "1600x1200-80"
    # D: 205.846 MHz, H: 99.347 kHz, V: 79.989 Hz

    timings 4858 272 48 32 5 152 5
    accel true
    rgba 5/11,6/5,5/0,0/0
endmode

If I use X on an accelerated, normal Matrox screen, my monitor complains
on exit:
fH 49.4 KHz, fV 39.8 Hz
(and it doesn't sync at 40 Hz vertical refresh :-( ).
This is _half_ of the normal 80 Hz. Using fbset -a "1600x1200-80" before
X, of after X, doesn't do anything. Does anybody know what to hack out
in X to get it to _not_ reset my G400 to some unusable state? 3.3.6 was
didn't do this. I can use the framebuffer-screen just fine, but I miss
the DGA extension.
Thanks,
Jurriaan
