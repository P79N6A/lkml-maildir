Marcelo,
I observe a kernel panic at boot time if I set apm=power-off. OK with apm=off.
This is on an ASUS A7M266D with two Athlon XP 1800+. Since it works well on
2.4.19-pre10, I'm recompiling intermediate versions to check which one brought
the problem.
This is rather strange, since the crash occurs in do_softirq, but 2 bytes after
the beginning of an instruction :
c0120d09 fa			cli
c0120d0a 8b b5 80 17 3c c0	mov 0xc03c1780(%ebp),%esi
The crash occurs at c0120d0c (80 17 3c c0 ...). Seems like a bad pointer
somewhere.
Regards,
Willy
