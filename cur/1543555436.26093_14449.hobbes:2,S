I disagree: it could handle all cases I could see that we might
reasonably care about.  I challenge anyone to come up with a
non-pathological case that could not be taken care of with a single
LINK_FIRST and/or a single LINK_LAST.
The worst I can think of is something like "all PCI drivers must come
before all ISA drivers" which would require listing all of one set or
the other.  But when you see a case like that, it often means "this
directory really needs to be split", because you have two different
classes of things in a single directory.

That was the plan -- in 2.5.  (The 2.4 version did not disturb any
order at all, unless you explicitly put a LINK_FIRST declaration in the
individual makefile.)  Now that LINK_FIRST is officially dead, none of
this will probably happen at all.

Too complex, no easy upgrade path (read: too different from status
quo), very little benefit over LINK_FIRST + LINK_LAST.  For the
topological sort in particular I'm interestested in how it's even
possible to do in a non-intrusive and maintainable way.
