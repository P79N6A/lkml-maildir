Hi Alan,
  I've revamped the sunrpc stuff for the NFSv3 client, and I believe
it is now approaching something that is correct. In particular, the
current version seems to handle NFS/RPC over TCP and SMP-related
issues more correctly than previous versions. I'm now getting NFS-over
TCP at rates only 20% or so lower than over UDP against our old DU
Alphaserver.

It should in addition be a tad more transparent wrt. what is going on
in the various routines.
In particular, I hope I've now got the
bottom-half/interrupt/SMP-safety issues straight. As previous versions
show; a certain amount of confusion did exist in my mind over which
combination of the 3 applied in various situations 8-(...
I've therefore rattled off a backport to the 'ac' series. At some
point, I'd like Dave's (and Linus'?) opinion on whether it has
some chance of being merged in to the main kernel.
I'm of course also hoping you and others could look at it with a
critical eye.
The patch against linux-2.2.11-ac3 can be found via WWW at
