Yup.   This happens when the disk fills up.  Andrea and I were
discussing it over the weekend.   There's a new patch in the -aa
kernels which doesn't quite fix it :(
We'll fix it in 2.4.19-pre somehow.  It's possible that this problem
causes a chnuk of zeroes to be written into the file when you hit
ENOSPC, which is rather rude.  But your file was truncated anyway.

Now it's *just* conceivable that the __block_prepare_write() problem
caused a junk request to be sent down to the driver, which caused
the driver to enter recovery, which it then screwed up.   But I
doubt it.
It's also conceivable that the NMI watchdog code itself caused
problems also.   Back in the days when it was permanently enabled,
some machines kept going silly until nmi watchdog was enabled.
Bottom line: I don't know why you got a SCSI error, and the lockup
is possibly a bug in the scsi layer.
