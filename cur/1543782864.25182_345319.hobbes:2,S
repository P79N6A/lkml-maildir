Selects the frequency of the timer interrupt.  This controls the timing
resolution of system calls.  So previously poll/select could be used
with a 1ms timeout.  Now with the default settings it can only do 4ms.

The previous value was 1000HZ.  And yes, changing the default from 1000
to 250 breaks the expected "make oldconfig" behavior.  Lots of people
are not happy about it, but were overruled by Linus.
