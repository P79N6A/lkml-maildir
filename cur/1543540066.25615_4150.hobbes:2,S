I'd just like to say first off i'm not subscribed to this list so anyone
with any answers as to why the problem is occurring should reply also to
me ...thanks.
    the problem is this :
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address

Now, the system is Debian Woody ... gcc version 2.95.2 20000220
the start-stop-daemon does the obvious, it works on kernels 2.4.0-test3
and previous, but none above
also, other problems  like Kernel panic's on boot with INIT on the
Test5-pre kernels
this seems to be kernel config specific, since i compile under the same
system a different config and it worked fine.... under this current
kernel   2.4.0-test4, my ftp server wont connect to it's port, giving
this message : connect failed: Transport endpoint is not connected.
yet apache works (btw, this problem doesn't occur when accesing the ftp
server via another node on the network directly to this box. . only when
accessing locally and through the router, which worked before using
test3)  with a pause between every access, but it works.   keep in mind
it's commenicating over a masq box which forward requests to port 80 and
21 to this box.  This was working fine with Test3
    for the bad config
http://psuedomode.homeip.net/bad_config
    for the working config
http://psuedomode.homeip.net/good_config
the good config was compiled for my firewall , it has a lot of
networking options set but i dont think this could be the problem, since
they're mostly modules and not very core to the kernel. but i could be
wrong :)
I guess if anyone can sort of point out what the evil option is that is
probably causing this i'd be really happy.
            Oh, i just noticed,  the bad config is a config file from
2.4.0-test4 whereas the config file that's marked as good is from
2.4.0-test5-pre5  ...this shouldn't be a problem since they're both
basically the same and the problem only occurred worse (i used the same
config found in the bad_config with -test5) with test5.
