Yes it does.  We use it to provide magic symlinks which point to different 
places for different people.  So we have for example a symlink called "ux" 
and it points to "/servers/USERNAME/our-server/ux" where USERNAME is the 
name from /etc/passwd matching the user id of the user accessing the 
symlink.  So in documentaion and in stupid programs which require 
hardcoding of path we specify "/ux" to find the shared space but in 
reality this is a different local directory for every user.  (To complete 
the picture the different local directories are actually the same remote 
directory but mounted with access permissions for each user separately 
using ncpfs.)
Best regards,
