Subject: Parport broken in >= 2.4.11

I have a IEEE1284 parport webcam (using the w9966 drivers).
In 2.4.10 everyhing is fine but in 2.4.11 through 2.4.15-pre4 parport_read() 
always fails and return 0 bytes. w9966.c has remained unchanged throughout.
What kind of changes has the parport drivers gone through? Has the parport 
interface to kernel drivers changed somehow?
