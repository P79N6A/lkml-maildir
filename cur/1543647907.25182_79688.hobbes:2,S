I'm all in favor of drivers/char/watchdog/, but when I asked way back when,
I could never get a response from anyone upstream willing to take patches.
Also, I've got patches around from Matt Domsch that did the move, and changed
around the necessary drivers/char/ files.  I haven't been keeping them up-to-
date, maybe Matt has.
