Hi,
Thank you very much for all of the comments.
The reason why I added the new field into struct pci_device_id is
as follows, though these are already explained completely by Andi.
    - By adding the new field instead of using driver_data, drivers
      can pass the flags to the kernel directly. That is, drivers
      don't need to call any new APIs to tell something to the kernel
      after checking their own driver_data in their .probe().
    - This new field can be used not only for ioport but also
      other purpose (e.g. MSI).
But according to the discussion, it doesn't look a good idea to add
the new field into pci_device_id this time. So I'll update my patches
to use the driver_data field instead.
Thanks,
Kenji Kaneshige
