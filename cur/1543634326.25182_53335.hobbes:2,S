Yes.  This is due to the "New and Improved Build System (tm)". (It's not
really new -- kbuild has been around as an option for a long time.  And
it's very certainly *not* currently an improvement.)  Get used to a lot
being broken in interesting ways for a while.
I just love the way the road to progress is paved with a high density of
nuclear land mines.  What a very lovely mess kbuild integration is creating.
I like the idea of "build in one pass", but that's kind of annoying in a
very broken development branch.  When I enter "make bzImage" that and only
that is what I (and almost everyone who builds kernels) expect to be built.
As one who used to manage source code for a living, let me share a simple
rule: never break the build system; when the build is broken, NO ONE gets
anything done.  One cannot completely replace a build environment over
night. (esp. when there are as many fingers in the pie as Linux.)
