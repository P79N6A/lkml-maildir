I actually suggested the exact same thing back in 1998 ( Link to post in 
archives: 
http://uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9808.1/1282.html
 ), 
but I never recieved much response. As I remember it, the emails I 
recieved where along the line of; "too much effort for too little gain, 
use clustering instead". I would still be very interrested in such a 
feature, but like back in 1998 this is still *way* out of my league to 
try to implement (but I'd be happy to help in testing :).
