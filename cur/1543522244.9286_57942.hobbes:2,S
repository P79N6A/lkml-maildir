Count your blessings brother!  What I wouldn't give for 1 per minute!

Yeah, I've confirmed all of the above also.  I can without doubt say
that squid under a polygraph load is a great way to reproduce the
problem.
I've compiled a pristine 2.2.14 kernel without Reiser (at AC's
suggestion) and found the problem to persist.
Mickulas suggested I umount the drive and see what happened to inodes to
find out just who was leaking.  The inodes remained high, suggesting a
socket inodes leak, according to him.
I've looked at netstat -a and lsof output and found that they remain
stable after reaching a reasonable maximum (I originally thought lsof
kept climbing, but have been proven wrong by longer tests).  file-nr
also remains stable (though extremely high under polygraph load...that
is to be expected however and is necessary).
squid under polygraph load is all about lots of opened net connections
(little ones) and lots of opened files (little ones), I'd say it's got
something to do with one or both of those things. 
It's been hidden this long though (since at least 2.2.13), so it must be
pretty specific to the workload of a caching proxy under high load.
