This is easy without changing CML2.  Make another config option
for auto-enabling hardware you "probably have"
Rules of the form "X86 and PARPORT implies PARPORT_PC" can then
be transformed to "X86 and PARPORT and PROBABLE_HARDWARE implies
PARPORT_PC"
Those who want a nice & easy config may then turn PROBABLE_HARDWARE on.
Those who want tricks like using only nonstandard (hi-performance?)
serial
ports on their pc and save memory on skipping drivers for the built-in
stuff can do so by turning the probable setting off.
