Yanmin, for that benchmark you ran, what was it meant to measure?
From what I can make of it its just write cache benching.
One thing I don't understand is how the write numbers are so much lower
than the rewrite numbers. The iozone code (which gives me headaches,
damn what a mess) seems to suggest that the only thing that is different
is the lack of block allocation.
Linus posted a patch yesterday fixing up a regression in the ext3 bitmap
block allocator, /me goes apply that patch and rerun the tests.

Linus' patch is the one that makes the difference here. So I'm unsure
how you bisected it down to:
  04fbfdc14e5f48463820d6b9807daa5e9c92c51f
These results seem to point to
  7c9e69faa28027913ee059c285a5ea8382e24b5d
as being the offending patch.
