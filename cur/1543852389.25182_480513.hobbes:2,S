No. Learn about the modulo arithmetic properties of the unsigned types.

Have you looked at time_after? It just performs a subtraction, after
casting both operands to long. It does not care which one is bigger than
the other. Basically, it performs the same calculation as the
delta_jiffies above, and then checks the sign bit.

I'm looking at a 2.6.17 kernel, and I can't find MAX_JIFFIES, or
JIFFIES_MAX. There is a MAX_JIFFY_OFFSET, which is something else. It's
the biggest delta that you can add to a value X so that time_after(X, X
+ delta) is still true. If you try to schedule something beyond now +
MAX_JIFFY_OFFSET, it will be put back in time.
Also, your calculation is buggy. MAX_JIFFIES would correspond to
ULONG_MAX. What you want is:
  (ULONG_MAX + 1 - last_queued + now)
This expression is now mathematically congruent to 
  -last_queued + now (mod ULONG_MAX + 1)
or
   now - last_queued (mod ULONG_MAX + 1).
The arithmetic of the unsigned long type is /already/ carried out modulo
ULONG_MAX + 1, so the ULONG_MAX + 1 term can be dropped from your
expression, leaving it as
  now - last_queued

What user space tool?

The user space tool is perhaps buggy, or you are misinterpreting its
output.

Some day, when you learn how to program.
