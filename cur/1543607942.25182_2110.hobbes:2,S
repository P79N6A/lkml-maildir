The only difference is when an RT task is currently running and another RT
task kicks in with a not favorable preemption_goodness().
In the current scheduler reschedule_idle() loops through the CPUs to find
one for the incoming RT tasks while the proposed scheduler actually
doesn't.
What I'm coding is to plug in get_best_cpu() a way to evenly spread RT
tasks between CPUs.
But even the RT task rapid move to another CPU is not too rapid due
IPI+schedule() latency.
Maybe it's faster the currently running RT tasks to reschedule instead of
the remote CPU, maybe :)
The current IPI method creates very funny/undesirable behavior due
IPI+schedule() latency.
When watching at the  schedcnt  dump of a  lat_ctx  of my 2 way SMP
system, I saw both tasks lying on the same CPU with the other one
tempested by reschedule IPI without being able to catch one task due latency.
