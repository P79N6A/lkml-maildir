Keep in mind that those animals are reused. OTOH adding a generation
number to mm_struct is trivial - the only static one is init_mm (*never*
happens to be tsk->mm under 2.3.11+, only for kernel threads under the
earlier kernels) and the rest is always created by mm_alloc(). So it's a
matter of one static counter.

It's a race unless you are dealing with your children. Nothing guarantees
that process will not be killed and its PID reused between the moments
when you read the ids. The only way to do it without race is to watch for
SIGCHLD.
