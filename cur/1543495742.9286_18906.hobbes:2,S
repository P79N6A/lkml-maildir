I've been seeing random sound failures with 2.2.7 and 2.2.8.  I ran 2.2.1
for a long time with no such problems.  The problem is sound stops working,
and I get "kernel: Sound error: Couldn't allocate DMA buffer" in my logs,
or "kernel: DMA memory shortage. Temporarily falling back on virtual DMA".
It usually works if I try again a little later, although once it remained
broken until I rebooted.
Anyone else see this?  I'm using a SoundBlaster 32.
