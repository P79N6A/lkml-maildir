I just read an article by RMS in which he is thinking of changing
libraries over from the LGPL to the GPL. This will have the unwanted
side-effect of driving commercial interests away from further ports of
proprietary software (potentially deny these ports' future conversion to
open source)
RMS's article is at 
http://linuxtoday.com/stories/2754.html
That man is starting to worry me. If he forces certain critical libraries
such as glibc into the GPL instead of the current LGPL, it spells deep
trouble for all.
Cheers,
Alex
