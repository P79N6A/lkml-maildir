In NLM, a cookie can be used to identify the asynchronous reply to the
original request. Previously, there was a hack in the code that
sends GRANT replies to reuse the original cookie from the client's
LOCK request. The protocol spec explicitly says you must not rely
on this behavior; the only reason I added this kludge was that some
HPUX and SunOS versions did just that.
The down side of that kludge is that we are using a client-provided cookie
in one of our calls - which means we keep our fingers crossed it doesn't
collide with the cookie we generate ourselves. And to reduce the risk,
we also check the client IP when searching the nlm_blocked list. But it
is incorrect, and a kludge, and the longer I look at this code the
more I'm amazed it hasn't blown up.
This patch changes the code so that the only cookies we ever use
to look up something are those we generate ourselves, so they
are globally unique. As a consequence, we can stop using the client's
IP when searching the list.

This is no longer true after applying this change.

Given an incoming NLM_GRANTED_RES, how can you look up the nlm_host
and the pending NLM_GRANTED_MSG?
The reply may not come from any IP address you know of. The whole
reason for introducing this cookie nonsense in the NLM specification
was that the RPC layer doesn't always give you enough clues to
match a callback to the original message.
So this is really a bugfix which you *do* want to apply.
