That presupposes that the person they give the specs to is the person
writing the driver. I don't remember shawn offering to write a driver
or anything approaching that.
As I see it, if Shawn has permission to freely distribute the specs,
he can send a copy to Alan Cox for forwarding to the relevant driver
developers. However, if he has to sign an NDA to get them, they're
useless...
Alan: Am I right in assuming this?
Best wishes from Riley.
