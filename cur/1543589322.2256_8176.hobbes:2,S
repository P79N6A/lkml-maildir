Hehe, you have read this MXT patch on linux-mm, too? ;-)
There we have 10x faster memmove/memcpy/bzero for 1K blocks
granularity (== alignment is 1K and size is multiple of 1K), that
is done by the memory controller.
This can only be done in the kernel, because it is critical we
access here.
Good idea.
