I don't mind splitting them into a separate patch (and offered to do so
in the earlier posting against 2.5.67), but I don't agree that they are
a different issue.  The changes to the LSM xattr-related hooks are part
of supporting the use of extended attributes by security modules for
file security labels; the changes permit the security module to update
the inode security structure upon successful setxattr calls, and to
provide atomicity for the check and update of the security label.

The idea of using separate attribute names for each security module was
already discussed at length when I posted the original RFC, and I've
already made the case that this is not desirable.  Please see the
earlier discussion.
