Linux is very much not a micro-kernel.
Micro-kernel doesn't have to do with the size of the image, it has to do
with the overall design and where you place certain functionality.  In a
monolithic kernel, you put all the things necesary to a working system in
the kernel.  In a micro-kernel, you have almost nothing in the actual
kernel and all your functionality happens in user space daemons.
In fact, things like knfsd and projects like khttpd make it look like
we're moving even more towards a monolithic model instead of the other way
around.
I have a question, though maybe this isn't the right place to ask it: how
does MkLinux work?  My understanding is that Linux is run as a single
server on top of a Mach kernel.  Is this true?  And if so, is it possible
to run it on any platform that is supported by Mach?  There's an HP
PA-Risc Linux port in progress; I think that Mach already supports
PA-Risc - if so, why couldn't you just run MkLinux on your HP 9000's
instead of doing a full-on port?
