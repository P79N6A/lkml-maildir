Its a tough one alright. Some of my friends at Microsoft would suggest
using UUIDs for this job. They might be clumsy but at least they are never
going to collide and they are easy to generate.
As far as sysctl goes, FreeBSD deprecates the use of numbers for OIDs and
has a string-based mechanism for exploring the sysctl tree.
