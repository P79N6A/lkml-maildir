Startup routine of a scientific app calls a multithreaded "fetch work" 
routine, then crunches the data using a single thread.  This could even 
happen somewhere inside a library, so the application itself is unaware 
that threads were ever invoked.  This is not a far-fetched case.
You really need per-address object notions of "threadedness" when 
talking about shared memory, since you may need shared memory to be 
atomic, but operate on the heap in single threaded fashion.
