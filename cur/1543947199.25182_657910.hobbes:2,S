Doh! :*)
I had mistaken cap_init() for cap_get_proc() in the wireshark code...
I now see what wireshark is trying to do, and can *confirm* that with
the present patch I do maintain the legacy behavior. :-)
FWIW I've updated capsh in the libcap git tree to add a few more hooks
and with the following sequence can now verify that the keep-caps works
as before:
As root:
# rm -f tcapsh
# cp capsh tcapsh
# chown root.root tcapsh
# chmod u+s tcapsh
# ls -l tcapsh
# ./capsh --uid=500 -- -c "./tcapsh --keep=1 \
~  --caps=\"cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=ip\" --uid=500 \
~  --caps=\"cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=pie\" --print"
# echo $?
0
The wireshark problem, that you have been discussing (in the other
thread), can also be simulated as follows:
# ./capsh --uid=500 -- -c "./tcapsh --keep=1 \
~  --caps=\"cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=ip\" \
~  --uid=500 --forkfor=10 --caps= --print \
~  --killit=9 --print"
You might like to re-post your fix for that problem as a stand alone
patch; I suspect it may be lost in the noise at this point. (You might
also like to update the comment in that fix since the old comment looks
very stale if you delete the ->euid==0 check. I think it is safe to
simply say /* legacy signal behavior requires that a user can kill any
process running with their uid */)
Cheers
Andrew
