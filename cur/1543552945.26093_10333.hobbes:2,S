Of course it is possible. - There are drivers out there doing similar 
things. - Unfortunately while the one I actually know is open source the 
program attaching to this driver is not open source so you can only see the 
kernel side of the solution. )-:
Download: 
ftp://ftp.sigmadesigns.com/NetStr_2000/NetStream2000-0.1.033.0.tar.gz
Gunzip/Untar the archive and look in the Barbados/kernelmode directory in 
the file quasar.c. - In that file you will find the implementation of some 
IOCTLs and the one you will find most interesting is IOCTL_SEND_PID which 
is used for the purpose of registering a user space ISR with the kernel 
mode driver.
This concept can easily be extended by another passed in argument 
containing which ISR to register with this call or you could do them all at 
once whatever suits you.
Hope this helps.
