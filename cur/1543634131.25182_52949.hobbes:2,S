Hi!
  I was wondering if anyone was also experiencing a problem in generating
kernel symbols for the 2.5.22 kernel.  I am notificing quite a few ksyms
that have not been properly generated (e.g. "sprintf_R__ver_sprintf"
instead of "sprintf_Rsmp_xxxxxxxx").  Please pardon me if this is a FAQ,
but I have installed the lated modutils and am still experiencing this
problem.
 Thanks,
  Seth
