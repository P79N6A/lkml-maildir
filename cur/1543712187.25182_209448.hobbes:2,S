Perhaps reboot() can have parameter for that.

If you are doing "resume=swap:<something>", why not "resume=lzw-swap:something"?

Boeing can keep external patch, this seems like pretty dangerous
feature for joe user. And it should not be selected at /proc, but as
command line parameter.

Should not be needed. There's reboot() syscall to do that.

That should be return value of reboot() syscall.
