With a bit of imagination, you might even be able to
call our current scheme two-handed...
Even though it's a bit different, it seems like we
have all advantages and none of the disadvantages of
a two-handed system. The main difference is that we
do I/O on the first hand and page eviction on the
second. This gives us a buffer of ready-to-evict
pages which we can easily free when we're in a hurry.
The only thing we really need now is a way to keep
track of (and manage) that buffer of freeable pages.
I believe Andrea has a patch for that -- we should
check it out and incorporate something like that ASAP.
There are several reasons why we need it:
- we should never run out of freeable pages
  because that can introduce too much latency
  and possibly even system instability
- page aging only is effective/optimal when the
  freeable buffer is large enough
- when the freeable buffer is too large, we might
  have too many soft pagefaults or other overhead
  (not very much of a concern, but still...)
- keeping a more or less fixed distance between
  both hands could make the I/O less bursty and
  improve system I/O performance
