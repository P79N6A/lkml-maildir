Uh, the most common platform on which Linux is run?
Important point:  unless the sales volumes of this card exceed a certain 
point, the project is pointless.
The volumes in, say, the Sun market are so low that you'd can't get 
decent a console graphics card for under $300.
But the Sun/Solaris market doesn't care about open source.  So why bother?
