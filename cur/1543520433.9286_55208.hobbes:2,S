I guess you meant strstr(u.machine, "64"), right?
+        if (!uname (&u) && !strcmp (u.machine, "64"))
+                return depmod_main_64(argc, argv);
+        else
+                return depmod_main_32(argc, argv);
I'm not aware of any uname -m machine which calls itself just 64.
BTW: If you want to rationalize this, you'd perhaps want to make some inline
arch dependent function and use it in the arch dependent code. You don't know
what uname (if different from the standard at all) will use mips64, ppc64
and I'm not sure if ia64 uses ia64 actually at all.
Cheers,
