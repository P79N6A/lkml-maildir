Subject: schedule_task still available in 2.5.41 ? (working on nvidia kernel module driver, but maybe not related)

Greetings,
While trying to work on the NVidia kernel module patch found on this
list for 2.5.40, a little changes later everything seems fine except the
following point :
-=-=-=-=-
[shaman@d133 NVIDIA_kernel-1.0-3123.shaman]$ make
echo \#define NV_COMPILER \"`cc -v 2>&1 | tail -1`\" > nv_compiler.h
cc -c -Wall -Wimplicit -Wreturn-type -Wswitch -Wformat -Wchar-subscripts
-Wparentheses -Wpointer-arith -Wcast-qual -Wno-multichar  -O -MD
-D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE -D_LOOSE_KERNEL_NAMES -DNTRM -D_GNU_SOURCE
-DRM_HEAPMGR -D_LOOSE_KERNEL_NAMES -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE
-DNV_MAJOR_VERSION=1 -DNV_MINOR_VERSION=0 -DNV_PATCHLEVEL=3123
-DNV_UNIX   -DNV_LINUX   -DNVCPU_X86       -I.
-I/lib/modules/2.5.41/build/include -Wno-cast-qual nv.c
In file included from nv.c:14:
nv-linux.h:40:4: warning: #warning This driver does not _officially_
support 2.5.x development kernels!
nv.c: In function `nv_kern_isr':
nv.c:1679: warning: implicit declaration of function `schedule_task'
-=-=-=-
So I first though that an include file was missing, but I can't find a
.h in linux sources to would do :
[shaman@d133 linux-2.5.41]$ grep schedule_task -ril * 
( lots of .c files )
include/linux/module.h
It seems that module.h only talks about schedule_task as an example
(in comments lines).
I'm a little at lost, as it seems many drivers do use schedule_task. A
search on this list's archive doesn't get me anything interesting from
this point of view.
Any hints ?
With best regards,
