Great! Do you have any latency numbers ? Just curious.

AFAICS, the ordering of call_rcu() and init_completion should not matter
because the CPU that is executing them would not have gone
through a quiescent state and thus the RCU callback cannot happen.
Only after a context swtich in wait_for_completion(), the callback
is possible.

Oh, I didn't mean the part about waiting in release_nmi() until
the release is complete (RCU callback done). That is absolutely
necessary. I was talking about looping until the handler is
not busy any more. I think it is safe to just do a wait_for_completion()
and return in release_nmi().
Thanks
