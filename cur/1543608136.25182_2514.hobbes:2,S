Subject: [PATCH] back from NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I found a way to get me out of the dreadful
	NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
condition, which irremediably used to hang the network on my machine,
forcing me to reboot.
This fix was inspired by the long thread between Manfred Spraul and
Franck de Lange, a while back.
The fix leads to the following trail in kern.log:
 NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
 eth0: Tx queue start entry 23742746  dirty entry 23742742.
 eth0:  Tx descriptor 0 is 00002000.
 eth0:  Tx descriptor 1 is 00002000.
 eth0:  Tx descriptor 2 is 00002000. (queue head)
 eth0:  Tx descriptor 3 is 00002000.
 eth0: Setting 100mbps full-duplex based on auto-negotiated partner ability 45e1.

Here's the patch.  It only fixes the 8139too.c network driver, because
this is the one relevant for me.  Perhaps this can be added to other
drivers as well?
NOTE: the printk(KERN_EMERG) is probably too high for logging everything.
A KERN_CRIT would perhaps be more suitable, but Manfred had used this
in his patch, and I respected his decision.  However, having all my xterms
clogged with:
	Message from syslogd@nice at Wed Oct 31 23:37:36 2001 ...
	nice kernel: Kicking IO-APIC pin #16: 
is probably excessive ;-)
