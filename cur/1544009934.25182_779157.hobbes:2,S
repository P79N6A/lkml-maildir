| I think that's fine. Notice that this is not the allocation of an
| object, but the allocation of a cache descriptor. We save the flags
| inside the descriptor so that when the user calls kmem_cache_alloc, we
| can pass them along to slob_alloc, where GFP_ZERO can take effect.
| 
| So, if we're comfortable with the idea that we can only create caches in
| 'normal' contexts, then I think the patch is fine.
