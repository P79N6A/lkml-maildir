Subject: [patch] 2.3.51 oddity in expr (scripts/Menuconfig)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

GNU expr and BSD expr seem to have fairly different ways of handling
patterns for the `:' operator -- the GNU style of using '\|' to split
patterns doesn't seem to work on BSD exprs, and the BSD style of using
'|' doesn't work on GNU (tested on an Irix box, Mastodon, SLS, and a
Solaris box.)   I believe this patch actually will work on both flavors
of expr, and help preserve the cosmic balance of the world.
