Agree.  Anyone who really has 3 CPU hogs on a 2 CPU machine, *and*
never runs two more tasks to perturb the system, *and* notices that
one runs twice the speed of the other two, *and* cares about fairness
(ie. not RC5 etc), feel free to Email abuse to me.  Not Ingo, he has
real work to do 8)
Cheers!
Rusty.
