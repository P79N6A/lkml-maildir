Hi!
There's extremely stupid bug in sleep.c -- it will only alow user to
enter *unsupported* states. What's even worse that I remember fixing
that once before, and *it was merged to mainline*.
Please, really merge it to all copies so it is not reintroduced again.
[Oh, at it also makes S4 transition fail when SWSUSP support is not
there.]

What goes next? Inserting advertisment *into* email?
