Sorry about that, Chief.  ra_pages, presumably.  That's one
which *has* to be initialised.
I've added quite a lot of "if you didn't provide one then I'll 
do the default" code, but that's an interim step - later, all
the address_spaces need to be populated with the right stuff.

That's all generic code.   It's initialising core
kernel fields.  If should be done in the core kernel.
It would be better to split the address_space initialisation
parts out of inode_init_once(), and export the new function...
