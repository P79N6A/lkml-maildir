Ah - ok, so you are saying we could query the device to see if it supports
STM/GTM and then if we were to use the workaround I suggested for this bug
we could just refuse to execute GTF on devices which support STM (since
they may require execution of STM first).  If you guys decide you want 
the workaround rather than just either disable acpi or remove the acpi patch
entirely, let me know and I'd be glad to rework it, otherwise I'm assuming
you have decided to just disable acpi all together.
