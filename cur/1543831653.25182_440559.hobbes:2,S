I don't have a commitment to one way or the other, probably because
there are some things that are unclear in my mind.  Could you help me
with them?  Can you define what is the address space vs. the file level
please?  It is odd to be asking such a basic question, but these things
are genuinely unclear to me.  If the use of something varies according
to the file, is it a file method?  What things vary according to address
space and not according to file?  Should things that vary according to
address space be address space ops and things that vary according to
file be file ops?  If that logic seems valid, should a lot more be changed?
Oh, and Andrew, while such things are discussed, could you just pick one
way or the other and let the patch go in?
