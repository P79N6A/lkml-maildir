So it should be no surprise that this patch works ok for ia64, but here
is the ACK anyway.
>+#ifndef __ARCH_SYS_PTRACE
Most of the existing "#define ARCH_foo" uses don't have a prepended
"__" (current score is 20 to 3).  So there is a small question of
going with the prevailing style, or doing the right thing.  Just in
case anyone else raises this, my vote is with "__".
