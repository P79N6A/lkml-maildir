I have the same kind of problems with 2.4.0-test8, test-9-pre[678].
I'd thought it is due to bug in my (usb pegasus) driver which i used
most of the time. But i got the same crash with eepro100 which is
considered to be fairly solid.
The bug appears when netscape tries to switch the windows or open new
one. I'm afraid the newest RvR's MM code is not so stable.
best,
Petkan
