I am currently working on this, so far I've managed to sort out the irq
problems and only have some dma stuff that does not compile.  I don't
think I'm going to bother getting it to compile though and rather
directly convert to the new DMA-mapping stuff.  If anyone has any
pointers and tips and pitfalls I need to look out for, please don't
hessitate to mail me (It will be greatly appreciated).
