Is there any way to reconfigure the kernel at runtime to change the
limit for arguments passed during an exec? I guess I am looking for
something similar to systune ncargs under IRIX. I found this thread
in the archives:
http://uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0003.0/0160.html
The only suggestion was to patch and recompile the kernel. I looked
into sysctl and I couldn't find an appropriate argument to tweak.
Thanks for any info,
KV
