Reiserfs has no reported bugs for 2.2.1, but the 2.2.7 refile-buffer and
mark_buffer_dirty() code made mark_buffer_dirty() non-atomic which
caused us a lot of problems.  We have that mostly solved, but there is
one remaining rare bug for 2.2.7 which we are working on.
Reiserfs currently doesn't store stat data and directory entries in the
same packing locality as file bodies.  This is an error, and it will be
fixed.  Once that is fixed, it will do what you want tarfs to do.  If we 
implement a repacker, it will really do what Larry wants very nicely....

Maybe.  I have considered it.  I have not implemented....  Only
implementation will tell.  I think the answer is yes, somewhat.
