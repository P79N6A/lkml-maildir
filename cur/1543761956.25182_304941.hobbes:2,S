hm, weird, and i have no solution for this yet. But i just found a
related bug in the -RT patch in that it reverted a latency breaker in
the ext3 path that your trace shows - affecting PREEMPT_DESKTOP. Could
you try the 40-03 patch i just uploaded (assuming it's stable for you
otherwise ...) and see whether you can still reproduce these latencies?
(if yes then please also send me a full trace via private mail, or bzip
-9 it in your public mail.)
