I guess your hosts run out of memory for storing open sockets.
It's propably like synflooding yourself to death.
When I was once doing synfloods tests, I could store only about 170
connections before having the same effect as you: packet drops.
So:
1. Try enabling syncookies (in the kernel _and_ in
   /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies)
2. Try increasing
   /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_syn/backlog
3. Try reading about other memory related knobs.
   /usr/src/linux/Documentation/network/ip-sysctl.txt
4. When reading about syncookies in ip-sysctl, read also:
   
http://cr.yp.to/syncookies.html
   especially the last section called: SYN cookie monsters.
   Both of these documents are in contradiction about 'protocol
   violation', etc. I wonder, has this been sorted out among Kuznetsov,
   Akkerman, Metzger and Bernstein?
   Anyway I feel safe with D. J. Bernsteins notes about it.

Maciej
