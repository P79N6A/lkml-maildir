As would I. We have seen the Addmax linux port, however, so 
don't expect me to bet a paycheck on SecureWare never coming in.

It's no sweat off my nose if we have a dozen. SELinux and Smack are
both general mechanisms. There are situations where very specific
mechanisms would be useful, Smack would be overkill and SELinux
massive overkill. Argue that those mechanisms would never make it
upstream if you like, but I'm not convinced that they don't have a
place.

SELinux makes all sorts of checks, some of which fall into the
traditional notion of MAC and others (e.g. port binding) that are
not. SELinux has generally eschewed the capabilities paradigm in
favor of enforcing the loaded "policy" and the rules it defines.

How do you explain the SELinux behavior to a user today?
I have never figured out how to tell if running a given program
against a given file will succeed or fail with SELinux.
If couldn't be that much additional burden to explain.
Put a comment in the reference policy that says:
   #
   # Policy not affected by CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE
   #

Yes, I understand that that makes some sense given your
assumption that there won't be any more LSMs that would use it.
But I want to be clear that the capability is not overriding
the entire LSM, it is telling the LSM that the process has
"appropriate privilege" and should act accordingly.
An LSM that implements a descretionary mechanism would have
the same opportunity to ignore CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE as SELinux
would to ignore CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE. I think you might have a tough
row to hoe if you're suggesting that CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE should
be changed to CAP_MODEBIT_OVERRIDE.

Methinks there's a difference between what's possible and what's
allowed here. It's possible for a file system to do the same thing,
but I don't see it being allowed.
That, and you seem to be arguing both sides of the coin. We're both
pointing out that the LSM treats the capabilities as it will. SELinux
restricts port binding even in the presence of the appropriate
capability there.
I really don't see anyone getting their knickers in a twist because
there's another capability that SELinux doesn't honor.
In the end we can call it CAP_LATE_FOR_DINNER if that's the only way
I can move forward. CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE is the obvious partner to
CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE, so that's still my preference. CAP_SMACK_OVERRIDE
unnecessarily ties it to one LSM, and in spite of what some people
still seem to think, I see more LSMs in the pipeline.
