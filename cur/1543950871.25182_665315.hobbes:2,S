Hi Matthew,
thanks for your comments

Because using a new protocol code means I need to patch all the place 
where there is a comparison between us->subclass and US_SC_SCSI.
After all I am US_SC_SCSI with a special case for ATA12 & ATA16 commands.
I don't translate all scsi to atacb (that's what does US_SC_ISD200).

Ok, I will move it in another file.

What do you means by having a separate 'dispatcher' function?
You means why I have 2 functions emulate_pass_thru_with_atacb and 
usb_stor_transparent_scsi_command_atacb ?
I did 2 functions for having a code more clean.
You suggest something like
void usb_stor_transparent_scsi_command_atacb(struct scsi_cmnd *srb,
                        struct us_data *us)
{
     if (srb->cmnd[0] != ATA_16 && srb->cmnd[0] != ATA_12) {
         usb_stor_invoke_transport(srb, us);
         return;
     }
     copy emulate_pass_thru_with_atacb code here
}

But 'emulate_pass_thru_with_atacb' only handle ATA pass_thru scsi 
commands. It doesn't translate all scsi commands to atacb like 
'cypress_atacb' could suggest.
That's why I put 'usb_stor_transparent_scsi_command_atacb' saying it is 
transparent_scsi_command + atacb support.
