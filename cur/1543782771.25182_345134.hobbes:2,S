Yes please ... these issues do seem to be intermittent and hardware-specific,
so we'd like to know if relaxed enumeration timings work better for the folk
who have these problems.

Actually every EHCI version from kernel.org has always supported TTs;
I didn't submit it until full and low speed devices would enumerate,
an I could use USB keyboards and mice.  The reason it's a poor guess
is that TT support has nothing to do with this level of problem.  ;)
What's changed is how smart the _periodic scheduling_ support is.
The original algorithm took some major simplifying shortcuts, which
reduced functionality.  The latest code doesn't have very many of
those shortcuts.  It's accordingly a LOT more complicated.  Some
of the newer features need work yet (e.g. scheduling ISO OUT).
