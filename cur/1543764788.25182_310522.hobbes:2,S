Please drop these patches.
Using these symbols in non-GPL modules is a legal problem at least in 
the USA except for IBM, and all we've heard from IBM is that they are 
not 100% sure that there is really no binary-only module by IBM that 
might use these symbols.
The risk of anyne using them only increases (no matter that it's marked 
as deprecated) as long as it's available - and nobody has until now 
claimed that he's actually using one pf them in a binary-only module.
