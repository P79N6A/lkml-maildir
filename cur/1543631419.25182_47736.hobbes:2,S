Ok, I am becoming a frequent poster here.  Nothing in the logs on this one
either.  Left 2.5.17 running overnight on this box which used to be rock solid
unser 2.4.  kde was running, with a screensaver.  On attempting to use the box,
mouse mvement did dispell the screensaver.  alt-ctrl-f2 to get to a vc however
left me with a clean black screen.  Nothing worked....alt-sysrq -s or
alt-sysrq-u ddin't produce any disk activity.  alt-sys-rq-b did however reboot
the system.  only issue was unclean raid array afterwards ;)
TIA ;)
Erik
