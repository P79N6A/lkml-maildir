  Hi, all. I've just released version 1.2.12 of my devfsd (devfs
daemon) at: 
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
This works with devfs-patch-v130 (or later).
The main changes are:
- removed debugging messages
- added compatibility entries for joystick devices
- change directory to devfs FS.
				Regards,
					Richard....
