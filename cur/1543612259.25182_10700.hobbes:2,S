Hi Nathan,
I still don't like the class parsing inside the kernel, it's hard to see
what is good about that.
Is there a difference between these two?:
   long sys_setxattr(char *path, char *name, void *value, size_t size, int flags)
   long sys_lsetxattr(char *path, char *name, void *value, size_t size, int flags)
