This was previously discussed. To quiet gcc warnings, one can use "var=var", 
but you do not want  to hide it in a macro! That hides bonafide bugs. If you 
carefully review code and see that there is absolutely no possibility of 
using an uninitialized variable in any execution path, then you can assign 
it to itself to quiet the compiler.
