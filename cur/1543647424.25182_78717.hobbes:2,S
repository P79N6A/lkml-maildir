I don't know enough of linux internals to suggest anything
really useful. Perhaps something like: "drop pages which
weren't already loaded when we requested them" might be
enough to prevent cached stuff used by other tasks to be
removed from memory.

O_STREAMING is a way to reduce cache footprint of some
files, ad it does the job very well, unless those files
are accessed concurrently by two of more processes.
Thing again about to backup a large database. I don't
want to use tar because it kills the caches. I would
like a way to read the db so that the cached part of
the db (the 20% which gets 80% of accesses) is not
expunged.
Bye.
