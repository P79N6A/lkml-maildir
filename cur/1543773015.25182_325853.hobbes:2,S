Not really. Kref seems pretty light and loosely coupled with the 2.6 
kernel. There just appears to be a C file (and a .h of course).

I'm having problems porting the KObject and Work Queue infrastructure to 
the 2.4 kernel. Any ideas if anyone has tried this port?

I need to port RelayFS into a 2.4 kernel.
