First comment, the below is what Ingo suggested for
sched_find_first_zero_bit.  Note that this version is -before- the bit
array changed from [I believe] 140 to 100 bits.
Second comment, some of the bits in your patch are in 2.5.3-pre3.  [but
drivers/ide/ide-dma.c does not compile for me, unrelated to alpha...]
