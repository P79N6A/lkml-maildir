Subject: [PATCH] x86_64: mm fix x86 cpuid keys used in alternative_smp fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/24/104

From: Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>
The x86_64 crosstool build was failing due to:
  kernel/built-in.o(.smp_altinstructions+0x58): \
    include/asm/spinlock.h:54: undefined reference to `X86_FEATURE_UP'
This reference to X86_FEATURE_UP was added to the definition of
the alternative_smp() macro in alternative.h by the patch:
  x86_64-mm-fix-x86-cpuid-keys-used-in-alternative_smp
The alternative_smp() macro is used in spinlock.h.
The definition of X86_FEATURE_UP is in asm-x86_64/cpufeature.h.
If this is included in alternative.h, then the build succeeds.
