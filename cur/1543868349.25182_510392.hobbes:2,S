It's good to see someone building on someone else's work for once, rather
than everyone going off in different directions.  It makes one hope that we
might actually achieve something at last.
The key part of this patchset is the reclaim algorithm:

Alas, I fear this might have quite bad worst-case behaviour.  One small
container which is under constant memory pressure will churn the
system-wide LRUs like mad, and will consume rather a lot of system time. 
So it's a point at which container A can deleteriously affect things which
are running in other containers, which is exactly what we're supposed to
not do.
