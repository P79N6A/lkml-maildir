I have an old Planar wall mount with Chips & Tech video, powered by a
T.I. 486DX100 (the BIOS is 7 years old).  I originally bought it to
use the frame buffer in a portable application, and this patch is the
FIRST time I've ever obtained an image.  Thanks!
The colormap is wrong, but at least I have some sort of working device
now.  I shelved the project over a year ago, what's a good site to
come up to speed on?
