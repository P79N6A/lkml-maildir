Nice hack.  I'm not particularly attached to my implementation
but:
 * Dedicating a whole page per semaphore seems rather
   expensive for a "lightweight" primitive.
 * Possibly ditto even file descriptors.  I may want
   several thousand of these.
 * Are there any numbers for the VFS overheads?  There
   are quite a few lock acquires in there, even if the
   paths are fairly short.
 * It would be nice to keep the userspace structure
   opaque (except for the counter) and able to share
   it transparently between processes.
Actually, the more I look at Linus's original idea, the more
sense it seems to make (and the more I regret scrapping my
almost-complete implementation of it for the fd idea :)
