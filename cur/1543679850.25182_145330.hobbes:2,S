Would it be appropriate to have a limit on the number of pages which
become writable before a signal is delivered instead of continuing to
make more pages writable?  Just like the kernel, sometimes its good to
limit the number of dirty pages in flight in userspace, too.

It should clone the state, obviously, and COW should be invisible to
the application :)
Btw, are these pages swappable?
On a different but related topic, it would be most cool if there were
a way for the kernel to request memory to be released from a userspace
GC, prior to swapping the GC's memory.  Currently the best strategy is
for each GC to guess how much of the machine's RAM it can use, however
this is not a good strategy if you wish to launch multiple programs
each of which has its own GC, nor is it a particularly good balance
between GC application pages and other page-cache pages.
