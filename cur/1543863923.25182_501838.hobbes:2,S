Actually it _does_ have a way to handle it, if you think about the
problem a bit differently ... focus on high/low, not "inactive":
	spi->mode |= SPI_CS_HIGH;
	spi_setup(spi);
	// chipselect is now low (conventionally active)
	// ... then high during this next transfer:
	... write 74+ zero bits (10+ bytes)
	// now low again (conventionally "active")
	spi->mode &= ~SPI_CS_HIGH;
	spi_setup(spi);	
	// now high (conventionally "inactive")
That is, for just one one transfer, say the device uses inverse
chipselect polarity:  active-high, not active-low.  Then back to
normal.  Right?  So long as nobody else can access that SPI bus
(the claim/release issue), all should be fine.
That mechanism has been defined for some time, but not widely
implemented; a few chips rquite that semantic for chipselect in
normal operation.
If you agree on this, please update your patch #4 accordingly.
You may need to update your SPI controller driver to handle this
issue too.  (ISTR punting on making the bitbang framework handle
it, but so long as the chipselect is managed with a GPIO this
ought to be almost trivial.)
