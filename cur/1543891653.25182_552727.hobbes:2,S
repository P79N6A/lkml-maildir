Asuming you have multiple request log summary files, I would just run
multiple "splitters".

Because it has to, to return the result with the given API. 
But If you would have a async interface, the operation would still take that
long and your throughput will still be limited by the opens/sec your filers
support, or?

I agree that a unified async layer is nice from the programmers POV, but I
disagree that it would help your performance problem which is caused by NFS
and/or NetApp (and I wont blame them).
