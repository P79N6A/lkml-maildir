So this happens on more than one machine?
The kernel shouldn't freeze, so even if both machines have magically
identical hardware faults, there's a kernel bug there somewhere.
I guess it would be useful to test a 2.6.23 kernel if poss.  We've seen a
very large number of reports like this one in recent months (many of which
have not been responded to, btw) and perhaps someone has done something
about them.
