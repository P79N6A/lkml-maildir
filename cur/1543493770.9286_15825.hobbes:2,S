It is up to each part of the kernel to determine when a module is
required and load it.  It isn't something that happens by function
dependencies, like linking a binary might.  A good example is
sock_create() in linux/net/socket.c.  When a socket is created, a call
to request_module() is made with 'net-pf-%d' where the %d is filled in
by the socket family.  request_module() is what execve()s modprobe and
does the actual work.

ifconfig tells the kernel to configure eth0, for example, and the
kernel eventually calls request_module() with 'eth0'.  The user has,
hopefully, aliased eth0 to something like 'ne' and modprobe therefore
loads the ne.o module (and any other module that ne.o depends on).
When ne.o is loaded, its init_module() function is called, which
registers some callback functions that get called to do things like
send/receive packets or probe the card.
