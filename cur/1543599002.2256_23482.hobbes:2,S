So why not do it?  Or implement a nicer scheduler?  There are many good
ones.  There are o(1) schedulers that provide much better proportional
sharing.  They scale and also perform well even in "few running processes"
case.  They are also not hard to implement (I once implemented such a
scheduler with 100 lines of patch, and that fitted in the existing Linux
runqueue framework).  What's the resistence to scheduler changes?
