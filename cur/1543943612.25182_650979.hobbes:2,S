For me, 2.6.25-smp gives pretty irregular results :
time 6548 ms
time 7272 ms
time 1188 ms
time 3772 ms
The CPU usage is quite irregular too and never goes beyond 50% (this is a
dual-athlon). If I start two of these processes, 100% of the CPU is used,
the context switch rate is more regular (about 700/s) and the total time
is more regular too (between 14.8 and 18.5 seconds).
Increasing the parallel run time of the two threads by changing the upper
limit of the for(j) loop correctly saturates both processors. I think that
this program simply does not have enough work to do for each thread to run
for a full timeslice, thus showing a random behaviour.
However, I fail to understand the goal of the reproducer. Granted it shows
irregularities in the scheduler under such conditions, but what *real*
workload would spend its time sequentially creating then immediately killing
threads, never using more than 2 at a time ?
If this could be turned into a DoS, I could understand, but here it looks
a bit pointless :-/
