Here is something else I did that might be usefull;
While the sync command died while wait_on_dqu...
I did a quotaoff -a
Here is ps lwa | grep D
 FLAGS   UID   PID  PPID PRI  NI   SIZE   RSS WCHAN       STA TTY TIME COMMAND
     0     0  2325   821   0   0   1020   324 wait_on_dqu D   ?   0:00 sync 
   100     0  2347  2329   0   0   1040   388 wait_on_sup D   ?   0:00 quotaoff -a
So turning off quota again, and let see.
