alter_kthread_prio.diff
As discussed previously with Ingo; please include in at least one -mm
release.
Timeslice proportion has been increased substantially for -niced tasks. As
a result of this kernel threads have much larger timeslices than they
previously had.
Change kernel threads' nice value to -5 to bring their timeslice back in line
with previous behaviour. This means kernel threads will be less likely to
cause large latencies under periods of system stress for normal nice 0
tasks.
