Subject: [PATCH 2.6.9 0/2] enhanced accounting data collection
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

These two patches are the one we submitted to SuSE for Sles9 SP1.
They are clean of CSA specific code.
In earlier round of discussion, all partipants favored  a common
layer of accounting data collection. I believe these two patches are
the super set that meets the needs of people who need enhanced BSD 
accounting.
This patchset consists of two parts: acct_io and acct_mm, as we
identified improved data collection in the area of IO and MM are
useful to our customers.
It is intended to offer common data collection method for various
accounting packages including BSD accouting, ELSA, CSA, and any other
acct packages that favor a common layer of data collection.
'acct_mm' defines a few macros that are no-op unless
CONFIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCT config flag is set on.
Andrew, please consider including these two patches. Please let me
know how i can help!
Best Regards,
