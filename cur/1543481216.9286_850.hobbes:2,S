I'm afraid that I don't have such a think handy now.  However,
I have half an idea what might be happening.  Can you tell me
a few things?
 * What you're passing on the command line (and which bootloader
   if i386)
 * Does the net card get detected?  (Scan bootup messages.)
 * Are you configuring the IP manually, or is it getting done
   via rarp or bootp?
Matthew.
