Hello,
I've just released Linux 2.4.37.
It brings a few driver updates to 2.4.36, with all the fixes present
in 2.4.36.9. More specifically, a lot of recent revisions of common
SATA controllers have been added. USB storage is now more convenient
to use (no more buggy renumbering of the devices). Several Geode LX
drivers have been added (watchdog, i2c, rng).
Quite a bunch of machines have been running -rc1 and -rc2 since they
were released, so I assume they're pretty solid now.
2.4.36 will still be maintained for one or two versions for those who
have not had the time to qualify 2.4.37-rc. You should start migration
tests now if you haven't yet.
Special note for those who force module loading from earlier versions.
A recent security fix has enlarged struct task, so binary modules from
older versions will probably not load/work on this new kernel. It's a
bad practice anyway to do that, but now you've been warned ;-)
Several people have requested inclusion of a few network drivers. I
will study the opportunity depending on whether it makes sense or not
to merge them for everyone in a future release.
The patch and changelog will appear soon at the following locations:
