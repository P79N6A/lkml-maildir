Alan,
On a related subject, a few months ago you posted a patch which added a
nice add_timeout()/timeout_pending() API and converted many (if not
most) drivers to use it.
If I remember correctly it did not generate much comments and the work
was not pushed into mainline.
I think it's a nice cleanup, IMHO the time_(before|after)(jiffies, ...)
construct is horrible.
Any chance to resurrect this work ?
PS: the original subject was "Initial bits to help pull jiffies out of
drivers"
Best regards,
Eric St-Laurent
