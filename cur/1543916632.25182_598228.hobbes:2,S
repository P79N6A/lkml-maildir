Although it's not a big problem, we have the same issue with gcc 
warnings and errors displaying the full path with O= builds making the 
error messages quite long.
The root is that for O= builds we are feeding gcc the full path
We might perhaps attack it at this point?
The simplest solution that comes into my mind would be to create links 
for the source file in the output dir before calling gcc and then give 
gcc the link as input file.
