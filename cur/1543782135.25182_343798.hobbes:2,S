See ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/people/viro/patchset/T* + adb.h delta from CVS.
That's a minimum getting mainline m68k to sane state and not breaking
other platforms.  These are against -rc6-git2, but their counterparts
in more recent patchset have not changed.  BTW, m68k patches were not
in the series sent to Linus and I would definitely Cc m68k folks on them
if they would go there.
As for your s/thread_info/stack/ - I don't believe it's doable in mainline
right now.  It's definitely separate from m68k merge and should not be
mixed into it.  Moreover, mandatory changes to every platform arch-specific
code over basically cosmetic issue (renaming a field of task_struct) at
this point are going to be gratitious PITA for every architecture with
out-of-tree development.  And m68k folks, of all people, should know what
fun it is.
When folks start using task_thread_info() in arch/* (i.e. by 2.6.1[45]) the
size of that delta will go down big way and it will be less painful.  Until
then...  Not a good idea.
