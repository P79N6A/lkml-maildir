There are multiple effects of this code.
- Additional cacheline in use in the page fault handler 
  increasing the cache foot print.
- There are registers in use for checking the global variable.
- The compilers will reserve registers for the code that is never 
  executed which may affect other elements of performance. From the 
  register perspective a function call may be better on ia64.
Certainly not a big effect (if we make sure the compiler knows that 
this test mostly fails and insure that the variable is in 
__mostly_read) but this is a frequently executed code path and the code
is there without purpose if CONFIG_KPROBES is off.
It wont get too bad unless lots of other people have similar ideas about 
fixing their race conditions using similar methods. But we will be setting 
a bad precedent if we allow this.
