Since the shit seems to hit the fan above the ethernet layer... What about
putting the printk output into packets (e.g. one per line) and sending
them to logging host? Disclaimer: I'm a VFS hacker, not a networking one,
so it may be a total BS. Looks like a tweaked copy of dev_queue_xmit()
might be a decent starting point... Alan, your comments? Related question: 
how realistic it would be (in case of panic) to shove the dump into 802.2
packet and push it ahead of everything else?
