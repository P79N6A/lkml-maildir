Just looked. 
bio_alloc_bioset seems implicated, as does sync_page_io.
sync_page_io used to use a 'struct bio' on the stack, but Jens Axboe
change it to use bio_alloc (don't know why..) and I should have 
checked the change better.
sync_page_io can be called on the write out path, so it should use
GFP_NOIO rather than GFP_KERNEL.
See if this helps.... Actually this patch is against 2.6.12-rc2-mm1
which uses md_super_write instead of sync_page_io (which is now only
used for read).  So if you are using a non-mm kernel (which seems to
be the case) you'll need to apply the patch by hand.
Thanks,
NeilBrown

Avoid deadlock in sync_page_io by using GFP_NOIO

Ditto for md_super_write
