The kernel will support this, yes, but you need to run some kind of
userspace software to turn on or off slots.  Or if you have hardware
that recognizes that the power needs to be removed or applied (through a
latch on the slot), it could all be handled with no user interaction at
all.

No, the kernel runs /sbin/hotplug when it sees a new pci device, or when
one is removed.  A user never runs it on their own.
Hope this helps,
