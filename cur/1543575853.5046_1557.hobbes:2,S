I don't think this is the right way to fix the problem.  Take for instance
an EBSA285 platform which has only PCI sockets.  It is possible to plug in
a card with an ISA bridge on, with a ESS SB clone on board (I have one here).
Maybe the right thing to do is to define CONFIG_ISA on these architectures/
machine types where the device itself is actually an ISA device, instead of
going through special-casing the driver configuration entries?
