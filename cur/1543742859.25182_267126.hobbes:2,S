Except that
1. The file size has nothing to do with the binary size as it is full of
symbols and maybe debug
2. Most of the pages of libxml2.so don't get paged in by a typical
application
3. If you have existing apps using it then its cost to you is nearly
zero because its already loaded.
libxml2 is a very complete validating all singing all dancing XML
parser. There are small non-validating parsers without every conceivable
glue interface that come down to about 10K.
