And until it has done this, any child death will still only be seen
by init. So you either didn't have a problem with this in the first
place, or you can make sure your children don't die while their
parents are changing, or you've just designed yourself a race
condition.
A design where the parent simply doesn't die would be much better.

You could use ptrace to pretty much this effect. Of course, this
only works if the child processes don't already use ptrace for
some other purpose, and your parent now needs to respond whenever
a child gets a non-terminal signal (in addition to the terminal
ones).
