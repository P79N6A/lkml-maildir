Hi Jesper and all others:

  We are submittting patches; instead, we are submit the original 
sources for Winbond SD/MMC/MS/MSPro/xD/SM devicers. There are too many 
files and I am afraid once we copy and paste using plain text then the 
whole things do'nt look clear to you guys.
  Can we pack our sources then send them in one large attachment?
thanks,
dz
