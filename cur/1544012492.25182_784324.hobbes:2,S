No - it is worse than that.
My gcc does not complain about the above.
Just to check that I was not fouled by some preprocessor magic
here is the preprocessed code:
   printk("<3>" "%s: STC_TAG(%d)[PA(%016lx)VA(%08lx)"
          "V(%d)W(%d)]\n",
          pbm->name,
          i,
          ((tagval & 0x0fffffff00000000UL) >> 19UL),
          (tagval & 0x00000000ffffe000UL),
          ((tagval & 0x0000000000000002UL) ? 1 : 0),
          ((tagval & 0x0000000000000001UL) ? 1 : 0));
tagval is u64.
So it looks like my gcc does not promote:
((tagval & 0x0fffffff00000000UL) >> 19UL) to unsigned long long int
but your gcc does?
My gcc (build with Dan Kegel's crosstool):

Yup - I added Andrew on cc: only as information.
