I'm working on the architecture support for realtime on PPC64 now.
If the lock field of struct raw_rwlock_t is a long instead of int
then /proc/meminfo shows MemFree decreasing from 485608 kB to 485352 kB.
Do you have a preference for lock to be long instead of int?
Do you know if any of the other 64 bit architectures would have an
issue with int?
