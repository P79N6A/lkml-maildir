You are partly right, but it suffers from smp memory ordering bug:
CPU 1
write data to buffer (but they are
in cpu-local buffer and do not go
to the bus)
tests buffer_locked in
wait_and_rw_block->wait_on_buffer,
sees unlocked
					CPU 2
					starts to write the buffer, but
					does not see data written by CPU 1
					yet
cpu flushes data to bus
calls ll_rw_block, it sees
buffer_locked, exits.
new data are lost.
There should be smp_mb(); before wait_on_buffer in wait_and_rw_block.
BTW. why don't you just patch ll_rw_block so that it waits if it sees a
locked buffer -- you get much cleaner code with only one test for locked
buffer.
