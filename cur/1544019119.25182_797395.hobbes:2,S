Oh.  That sounds like a BIOS bug.  If there's only one actual
chip, the BIOS should not report it as two separate devices.
I guess it might report two devices if only one of them is
enabled at a time.  In that case, there might be a BIOS setup
switch to toggle between them.
Can you turn on CONFIG_PNP_DEBUG_MESSAGES and boot with the
pnp.debug kernel parameter?  Then collect the dmesg log and
the output of "grep . /sys/devices/pnp*/*/*".

The compatible device identifiers list is built by the kernel
based on the information from the BIOS.  Drivers don't have to
worry about it.

Can you point me to the driver?
If this is a BIOS defect, we might be able to write a quirk to work
around it so the driver doesn't have to get messy.
