Autofs is no good for me - I've tried it, it craps out if you try to make /mnt an autofs directory... If you use another
one you can't 'ls' it because it'll try to mount every share at once...  That's why the 2.2 kernels have supermount (which
has its own problems, like it doesn't recognise disk change sometimes).
It's not important to me if it never makes it into the mainstream kernels, really.  I'm just trying to 'scratch an itch'.
