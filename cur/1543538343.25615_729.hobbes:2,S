Lets not go here..........
It is bad enough that GPL code was STOLEN from an unnamed German company
by an Israil company that was orginally an ATA-PSUEDO-FLASH.  Personally
this junk is all Soft IP, and they have violated GPL in the past in the
2.0/2.1 kernels.  I have called them on the carpet, but with out the
legal backing needed I had to back off........
Mind you this was some time ago, when I knew less and had less of a
position to fight a good fight.
David W. has done what I do alot, but he can not publish all that he knows.
