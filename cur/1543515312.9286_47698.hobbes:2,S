We were talking about pages with IO in progress IIRC.  There is no need
to worry about VM pressure on those.
More concerning is the general issue of memory pressure on filesystems
which, due to complex mechanisms such as transaction write-ordering
requirements or defered allocation of disk blocks to data, cannot
arbitrarily flush individual pages back to disk on demand.  For such
long-lived structures in memory, we do need a decent place for the VM to
exert pressure --- this is still being worked out for 2.3.

Once we've persuaded Linus, yes. :)
