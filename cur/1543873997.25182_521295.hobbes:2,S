This is too hard to adjust. Imagine what would happen to your hundreds of
apache processes when the "backup" user will start the rsync or tar+gzip,
or when user "root" will start rotating and compressing the logs. Being
able to group processes may be useful on servers, but it should be enabled
on purpose by the admin.
