I can't call myself a "kernel developer", and I don't have figures.
But i believe it anyway [someone told he measured it, and also gave
good explanations].

That's a Java problem. Not a Linux one.

They have many "good" properties. A good cache behaviour is one of the
most important. Avoiding unnecessary (kernel) schedules is another.
Both are difficult to obtain.

Good point. It's true for me, at last.

I'm sorry, Jamie, but this is *your* reasoning error. You should 
demonstrate that real, well designed, well tuned applications
that switch very often (provided they exist: they lack one of the 
"good" properties, low swiching rate, so they may be not "so well 
designed and well tuned") also have long RQs.
In other words, I won't call an application that has both high
switch rate and causes a long RQ "well designed, well tuned".
I can hardly think of such an application which has a good cache
behaviour at the same time (that's my impression). 
So I think that an application that has both high switch rate and
long RQ is NOT "well designed, well tuned", and you should optimize it.

That's a good point.
But:
you failed to show any real world application, properly written for
performance (as we ALL like), that would take advantage of the proposed
scheduler change.
If you show me a bad written one, I can do the same. B-)
Unless someone more experienced than me has something to say about it,
the point now is:
- we can't show any good application that will take advantage of the patch;
- we can't show any good application that will be adversely affected by it.
So, right now, IMHO there are no reasons to consider the patch...
[ this leaves out >16 CPUs systems... it should be considered for them,
  if numbers show some real improvement for RQ around 20 ]
