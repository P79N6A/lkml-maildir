A bug making lspci see something different from what the kernel sees 
initially sounds to me like a sure way to drive maintainers insane. If 
somebody had a northbridge that also screwed up the rest of the word, and 
a device that a mmconfig-using driver recognized but had problems with, 
the user would be reporting lspci info with 0001:ffff as the device that 
doesn't work.

So would always using conf1 for the non-extended space (unless the 
platform only uses mmconfig), or at least for the first 64 bytes. I'd bet 
all the subtle bugs are in the first few words, anyway. (With blatant bugs 
in the rest, of course, where we want to blacklist busses and devices)
