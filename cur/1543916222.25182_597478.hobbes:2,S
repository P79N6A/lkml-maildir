A negative is that lockup conditions swallow partial messages.
Another approach that doesn't require any new buffering is:
id = printk_block_start();
printk_block(id, fmt, ...)
printk_block_end(id)
and have print_block output the id when multiple IDs are
concurrently issued.
This requires a trivial tool to post-process the log
when messages are interleaved.
