Given that log_error() seems to be a no-op at the moment AFAICT, and
that Ben H was concerned about possible deadlocks if log_error
actually did do something, I'd like to see a resolution of (a) what
log_error should be doing and (b) whether there is in fact any
possibility of deadlock with this patch once (a) is resolved.
Thanks,
Paul.
