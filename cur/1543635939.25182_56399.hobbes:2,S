I wasn't able to verify it so the AMD751 was disabled by default.

The single bit error has been corrected in only one direction,
in the data going to the cpu.  The data remaining in memory
was not corrected.

That the location is frequently read and there is no hardware
scrubbing (writing the correct value back to ram).

Both of which match.

Sounds like a questionable bit of documentation.

Hopefully we can get the problems well enough understood in the community
that we can actually get some of this code fixed up and working well.
