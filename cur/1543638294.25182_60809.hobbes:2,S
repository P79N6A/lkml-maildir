Just to correct you: it is normal magnetic disk with 512 byte sectors,
from notebook. It works with 512B UDMA requests if we talk to the drive
slowly, with pauses here and there. If we talk to it back-to-back, it
dies. Apparently it forgets that it is doing UDMA transfers and tries
to do normal PIO or MDMA or what - host terminates transfer in the middle,
and disk is signaling that it has more data to go.

It will not help. Device is reporting 512B sectors, and it even supports
them in PIO.
