Yes, the (just about) paid job is sucking all of my time away at the moment.
Martin von L. is still officially the NTFS maintainer, but I've heard 
virtually nothing of/from him for months. If I do anything, it'll probably
a complete rewrite, or perhaps a port of the Free(?)BSD driver. I'll also
need to have a rummage around and find out what's changed in the VFS/mm
systems since I last looked. Anyone want to pay me to hack filesystems? <g>
Whether NTFS {should,will have to} be dropped from 2.4 is a decision for
somebody else. If I find time I'll poke at it and see what needs doing.
Oh, and the PHB isn't too bad. He could be pointier-haired :-)
