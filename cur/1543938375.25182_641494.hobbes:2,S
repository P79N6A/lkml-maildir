Subject: [PATCH 48/49] jbd2: Use round-jiffies() function for the "5 second" ext4/jbd2 wakeup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Mingming Cao <cmm@us.ibm.com>
While "every 5 seconds" doesn't sound as a problem, there can be many
of these (and these timers do add up over all the kernel).  The "5
second" wakeup isn't really timing sensitive; in addition even with
rounding it'll still happen every 5 seconds (with the exception of the
very first time, which is likely to be rounded up to somewhere closer
to 6 seconds)
(Ported from similar JBD patch made by Arjan van de Ven to
fs/jbd/transaction.c)
