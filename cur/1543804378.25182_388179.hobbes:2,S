Subject: [PATCH 1/2] GFP_ZONETYPES add commentry on how to calculate
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

GFP_ZONETYPES define using GFP_ZONEMASK and add commentry
Add commentry explaining the optimisation that we can apply to
GFP_ZONETYPES when the lest most bit is a 'loaner', it can only be
set in isolation.
