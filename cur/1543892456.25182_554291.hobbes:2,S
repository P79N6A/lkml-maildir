This is as 12GB machine.  3 numa nodes.
I checked out the location of the IDT and GDT and both seem sane, in the
9xxxx range below the kernel destination.
I also note that on another machine of this type, one Node only in that
case some of the "did work" cases do not work.  Also when I applied some
of my patches on the top "working" cases stopped working.  So whatever
it is is definatly related to the shape of the kernel to be loaded.
Very confusing.
