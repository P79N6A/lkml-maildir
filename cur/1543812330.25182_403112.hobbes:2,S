Subject: how to find out which module was built by which .config variables?

Hello,
I need to create a database with configuration options (the ones 
in .config) and the resulting kernel modules.
Is there any simple possibility (with bash and its applications) to find 
out, which kernel modules will be built by which .config options? I know 
that there are also many dependencies between the options and the modules 
and I want to add them to the database too. The dependencies can be found 
out with the Kconfig files, I think.
I've already looked into the source files of some modules, but I can not 
find any commonalities which would make it easy to find the module-name 
which will be build.
I've found some stuff like this:
#define DRIVER_NAME	"8139too"
or things linke:
#define <something>_MODULES_NAME	"some string which seems to be the 
descriptive name"
But this doesn't really help... :(
Sincerely
Alexander Mieland
