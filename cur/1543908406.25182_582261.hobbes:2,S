I will submit it; we'll see whether anyone objects.
By the way, you can change the constant autosuspend and autoresume 
behavior easily enough.  All you have to do is:
	echo N >/sys/bus/usb/devices/.../power/autosuspend
where "..." is the path for the disk's USB device and N is the number
of seconds the disk should be idle before it gets autosuspended.  If
you use -1 for N then the disk will never autosuspend.
