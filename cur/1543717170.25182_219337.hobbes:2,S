I have two broken motherboards that have off-white color slots
that imply that they should certainly not blow up if anything
that fits is plugged into them!
So I plugged in two high-speed data-link boards and nothing worked.
Upon removal of the boards, my SCSI controller was no longer seen
on the PCI/Bus. I called the data-link board vendor (actually a
division of this company) and they said; "Idiot! They are 3.5 volt
boards!". I said; "Yeh? The PCI Spec says they should be compatible!"
They said; "There is no PCI spec for such compatibility......", etc.
etc. When I quoted the page on the book, they said; "That's only a
BOOK, not a specification...." It's just like the l-k list.
So, some new PCI/Bus boards are not 5-volt tolerant. Some new
board slots run at 3.5 volts so older PCI/Bus boards won't
work (some do, some don't). It's a mess.
I also asked our wizards in the other division what kind of
platform the boards were supposed to be working in. They said
it was secret, but not a PC.
Cheers,
