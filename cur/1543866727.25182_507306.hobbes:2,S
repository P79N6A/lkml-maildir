Actually, downcasing true and false in this driver is pretty much a
retrograde step.  The reason for their being uppercased is that they
represent constants (and uppercase is the traditional defined constant
specifier).
When discussion about TRUE and FALSE came up a long time a go in the
context of the mid layer we agreed to strip the defined constants out of
that code and just go with 1 and 0 inline ... because the code was
pretty much being rewritten.  We also decided to encourage but not force
the driver writers simply to use 1 and 0 as well ... a lot of people are
deeply wedded to the TRUE and FALSE defines, it turned out.
