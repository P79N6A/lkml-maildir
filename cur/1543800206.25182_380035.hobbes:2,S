OK, I am with you, but when I am trying (devel) -rc releases, I need devel pkgs
(my opinion). And there is some time then to move these devel pkgs to release
database until next not-rc become real. Indeed, changes like this in some -rc
just before stable release or BIG changes in -rc at all are crazy, but if
somebody do that, we all have the chance say "STOP, we don't want it" (that's
the one from points to get lkml) not only THE MAN before git-commit.
