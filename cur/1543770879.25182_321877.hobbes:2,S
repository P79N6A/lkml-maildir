another possible effect would be the interactivity code: the Wine 
processes gaining high priority via their scheduling pattern. I've 
attached a patch to make it runtime switchable (see more details below).

very interesting. This should not have any direct effect on scheduling 
correctness - but it might change the patterns and hence the priorities. 
A couple of things to try:
- run the Wine processes with nice +19 priority? (just to check 
  whether it's the interactivity code. After you've made sure they dont 
  have RT priorities.)
- renice -20 the X server process
- run a shell-script with RT priority that captures 'ps aux' every 
  second or so:
  chrt -f -p 1 $$  # switch shell to RT-SCHED_FIFO-prio-1
  rm -f log.txt
  while sleep 1; do
   date
   ps -eo pid,tid,class,rtprio,ni,pri,psr,pcpu,stat,wchan:14,comm
  done > log.txt
 (chrt comes from the schedutils package) Then send us log.txt and 
 identify the date where the 'hang' occured. (the hang will probably not 
 occur in this measurement script running at RT priority)
- apply the patch below and check whether doing:
   echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/interactive
  makes the hang go away.
- if the hang goes away then could you check whether removing the 2 new 
  sched_interactive lines in kernel/sched.c's effective_prio() function 
  (but keeping other portions of the patch applied) hang or not.
