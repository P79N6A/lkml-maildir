We take that into consideration only while calculating the loads.. But we
don't scale it down while calculating imbalance, resulting in the problem
I mentioned.

Peters changes in -mm fix this issue. Will this be pushed to Linus tree
before 2.6.16 comes out?

I don't have any test suites for testing "niceness". But I can def check
more to make sure that it doesn't cause any regression :)
