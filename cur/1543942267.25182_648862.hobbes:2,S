I can see why. I think we can change the format summary a bit and have one 
line per CPU only:
      Allocation                                           Deallocation
                        Page    Add     Remove  RemoveObj/                   Page    Add     Remove  RemoveObj/
CPU   Fast      Slow    Alloc   Partial Partial SlabFrozen Fast      Slow    Alloc   Partial Partial SlabFrozen
16000 111953360 1044    272     25      86      350        111946981 7423    264     325     264     4832
In addition, we can probably add some sort of option for determining how 
many CPUs you're interested in seeing (sorted by CPUs that have most the 
activity first).
