Yes.

Yes.

No, that should be it. Oh, you need to set SW_BIT in dev->evbit.

I think it shoudl be OK to send this event even if ACPI also sends it.
Recently I changed ACPI button driver to send SW_LID events and since
siwiches have state (on/off, open/closed) applications shoudl not get
confised by getting 2 events in a row (they shoudl not interpret it as
toggle).

I wonder what KEY_SWITCHVIDEOMODE does on Macs... Any Mac users out there?

Yes, I will merge the fisrt 2 patches once we work out the proper
keycodes/other events.
