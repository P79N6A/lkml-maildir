I used your config advices from second mail, still it does not work as
expected: system gets "too sleepy". Like it takes a nap during boot
after "dyn-tick: Maximum ticks to skip limited to 1339", and key is
needed to make it continue boot. Then cursor stops blinking and
machine is hung at random intervals during use, key is enough to awake
it.
