keventd knows how to clean up children, handle SIGCHLD, etc.  That code was
hard-won.
And kernel threads which are parented by userspace processes tend to
accidentally inherit things we'd rather they didn't.  daemonize() and
reparent_to_init() try to fix things up, but I'm still not sure we got it
all.
Using keventd will tend to prevent mistakes.
