Thank you for the info.  I was referring to the service on port 37 tho.
It used to be a pain to set up ntp, hence my use of "rdate".  Which
meant I had to find a machine running the "time" server, for which
I wasn't able to find any list of publicly available servers.  I can
only assume if someone is running the "time" server they intend for
others to use it.  Wouldn't you agree?
