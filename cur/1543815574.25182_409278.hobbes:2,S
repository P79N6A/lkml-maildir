Subject: [PATCH/RFC] expose Doc/ source files
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/21/485

From: Randy Dunlap <rdunlap@xenotime.net>
I propose that we expose example and tool source files in the
Documentation/ directory in their own files instead of being
buried (almost hidden) in readme/txt or shar files.
This will make them more visible/usable to users who may need
to use them, to developers who may need to test with them, and
to janitors who would update them if they were more visible.
Also, if any of these possibly should not be in the kernel tree at
all, it will be clearer that they are here and we can discuss if
they should be removed.

patch file (234 KB) is at:
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/patches/linux-2616-doc-sources.patch
Note:  Several source files in Documentation/ have build errors.
I have patches for those also, but I'll wait on sending those.
