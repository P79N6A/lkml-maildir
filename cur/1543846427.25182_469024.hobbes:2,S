Thanks for reading my question :)
I am looking for a Linux equivalent of the
security.mac.seeotheruids.enabled sysctl found on BSD. Preferably one
that works with the latest vanilla mainline kernel.
Basically if it's switched off then users cannot see other users'
processes, network connections, UNIX sockets, mounts, etc... but can
still see if they are logged in or not.
