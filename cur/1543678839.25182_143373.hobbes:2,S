Do you have ide-scsi built as a module though?
I use hdc=ide-scsi (or hdc=scsi) as a boot parameter too. But the 
difference seems to be whether you have ide-scsi built as a module or 
into the kernel. The reason I think I chose to have it as a module all 
these years (on previous thinkpads as well) was so I could remove the 
module and swap the dvd/cd-rw for another device.
I haven't had a problem with this configuration(hdc=ide-scsi and loading 
the module through modules.conf) with any of the previous stable 
releases of the kernel (pre 2.4.21.)
