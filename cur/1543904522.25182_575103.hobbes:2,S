.. and why do you think I want system sleep support? That's the bug.

I want SMP, dammit. This machine has multi-core. And I want ACPI. I just 
don't want the system sleep thing.
I didn't have it before, I don't need it, I don't want it.

That wasn't true before, and it makes no sense what-so-ever as an 
assumption.
The system sleep states are mostly usable on laptops. Not always even 
then. They are seldom used on desktops or servers, but both of those are 
often SMP machines, and certainly want ACPI.
So your "99%" makes no sense.

But why the *hell* is this dependent on ACPI?
Why not just do ACPI_SLEEP, and have *that* do "select 
HOTPLUG_CPU/SUSPEND_CPU".

That makes no sense. You're tying together things that have *nothing* to 
do with each other.
As mentioned (and as is *obvious*), pretty much everybody who has a 
multi-core CPU on x86 wants ACPI and SMP. But the set of people who want 
to sw-suspend such a machine is *much* smaller. There is no 99%.
