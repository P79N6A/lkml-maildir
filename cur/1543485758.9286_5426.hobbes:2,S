Hi,
I've got a SMP machine with a Creative 'ViBRA16X PnP' soundcard.
I have the sound drivers loaded as modules, I load by 'modprobe sb'
so they are not autoloaded or unloaded.
lsmod:
Module                  Size  Used by
sb                     31148   2 
uart401                 5644   2  [sb]
sound                  55608   0  [sb uart401]
soundcore               2244   5  [sb sound]
conf.modules:
  options sb io=0x220 irq=7 dma=1 mpu_io=0x330
Using 2.2.0 and 2.2.1, leaving the machine over the weekend, when I get
back there is no sound when playing sound.  It almost appears as if the
volume level is 0. But the mixer setting is not 0.  Unloading and reloading
the modules fixes the problem.
