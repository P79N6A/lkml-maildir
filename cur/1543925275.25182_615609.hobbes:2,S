I bet this can be defeated by prefetching for a write before
the read, but of course this won't help if the read is
being used to conditionally avoid the cmpxchg_local but I don't
think that's what you're trying to do here.
I've always wanted to add a write prefetch at the beginning of all of
the sparc64 atomic operation primitives because of this problem.
I just never got around to measuring if it's worthwhile or not.
