OK... but just bailing out here doesn't exactly solve the problem,
does it? Some data is already written at this point, so failing
just means that the underlying file just gets corrupted instead.
OTOH, my attempt to support partial writes isn't right anyway,
because it doesn't get propogated back to the caller correctly
anyway.
So we'll go with your patch, thanks.
