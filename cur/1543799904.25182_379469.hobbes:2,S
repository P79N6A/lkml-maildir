It basically looks OK.  I've updated it a bit, and will include an
updated version in any future updates of mine.  (Right now I have
to merge your second version with my updated one ... )
So we'll be well on the way to agreeing on a single SPI framework
to evolve and integrate against.

More expensive, but not in a way that will often matter much.  That
one's part of one-time init, for example.  And the attached code
uses the spi_message_add_tail(transfer, message) you had mentioned.

The updated code has only an spi_message_init() function.

Bug:  "t" is non-null but invalid there.  (Fixed.)
