	Mode	Mainboard/Card		Interrupt	Pins
	 1	ProtoType		shared		shared
	 2	BP6			shared		split
	 3	HA366			split		split
Mode 1
	ide(X)		interrupt A	pin 1
	ide(X+1)	interrupt A	pin 1
Mode 2
	ide(X)		interrupt A	pin 1
	ide(X+1)	interrupt A	pin 2
Mode 3
	ide(X)		interrupt A	pin 1
	ide(X+1)	interrupt B	pin 2
Modes 1 and 2 are explained in the OEM docs, and Mode 3 should not exist
after face to face questions to OEM.  This meaning less to most, but you
asked.
