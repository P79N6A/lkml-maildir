Yeah, you'd need CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO enabled as well. I don't think there
were any CFQ changes between feb 28 and march 5, so you could probably
still try it out. A quicker way:
- Edit .config and set CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y (near the bottom)
- make oldconfig
- rm block/cfq-iosched.o
- make block/cfq-iosched.o
- gdb block/cfq-iosched.o
(gdb) l *cfq_dispatch_insert+0x28
and see what that says. Should not take you more than a minute or so,
would appreciate it!
