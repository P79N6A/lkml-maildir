Subject: [PATCH] 2.4: updated preemptive kernel patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

It has been awhile since a post since I have been concentrating on
preempt-kernel in 2.5, however 2.4 preempt-kernel work is not stopping. 
Patches for 2.4.18, 2.4.19-pre2, and 2.4.19-pre2-ac2 are available at:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/preempt-kernel/v2.4
please use a mirror.  Patches for earlier kernel releases are available,
too, but may not be in sync with this release.  Users of Ingo's O(1)
scheduler are encouraged to use Alan's tree as it has O(1) merged. 
Older 2.5 patches are available as well, but preempt-kernel was merged
as of 2.5.4-pre6.
Also available are updated preempt-stats patches (tool for determining
length and cause of preempt-off periods):

for 2.4.18, 2.4.19-pre2, and 2.5.5.
