The latest maintenance release GIT 1.5.3.7 is available at the
usual places:
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/
  git-1.5.3.7.tar.{gz,bz2}			(tarball)

What's cooking for upcoming feature release v1.5.4 has been stablizing,
and hopefully this will be the last of v1.5.3 maintenance series.
By the way, if you are the package maintainer of git for a distro, or
the editor of an OSS oriented publication, and if you would like a copy
of release announcements, please let me know, so that I can add your
e-mail address to Bcc: on future announcement mails.  Sorry, but I
cannot handle subscription requests from individuals.

GIT v1.5.3.7 Release Notes
==========================
Fixes since v1.5.3.6
--------------------
 * git-send-email added 8-bit contents to the payload without
   marking it as 8-bit in a CTE header.
 * "git-bundle create a.bndl HEAD" dereferenced the symref and
   did not record the ref as 'HEAD'; this prevented a bundle
   from being used as a normal source of git-clone.
 * The code to reject nonsense command line of the form
   "git-commit -a paths..." and "git-commit --interactive
   paths..." were broken.
 * Adding a signature that is not ASCII-only to an original
   commit that is ASCII-only would make the result non-ASCII.
   "git-format-patch -s" did not mark such a message correctly
   with MIME encoding header.
 * git-add sometimes did not mark the resulting index entry
   stat-clean.  This affected only cases when adding the
   contents with the same length as the previously staged
   contents, and the previous staging made the index entry
   "racily clean".
 * git-commit did not honor GIT_INDEX_FILE the user had in the
   environment.
 * When checking out a revision, git-checkout did not report where the
   updated HEAD is if you happened to have a file called HEAD in the
   work tree.
 * "git-rev-list --objects" mishandled a tree that points at a
   submodule.
 * "git cvsimport" was not ready for packed refs that "git gc" can
   produce and gave incorrect results.
 * Many scripted Porcelains were confused when you happened to have a
   file called "HEAD" in your work tree.
Also it contains updates to the user manual and documentation.
