> Can I have now more than 15 partitions?
Two years ago I amused myself creating a few hundred partitions
on a SCSI disk. Yes, no doubt the availability of numbers will
remove the current limits on the number of partitions of a disk.
But, as I answered you several times already,
right now my topic is dev_t, not devices or partitions.
Just the number.
