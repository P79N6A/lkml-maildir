It's to be expected that "top" (or 3rd field of /proc/pid/statm) will
tell you that under heavy swapout.  It counts a page as "shared" if it's
currently mapped into more than one process (approx. description), and
swapout is doing its best to remove the mappings from processes, to free
up pages later; the usage count of the corresponding data, which would
include the swap usage count, is not being counted here (nor should it be).
If you were to swapoff, ideally you would find those shared counts going
back up to what they were; however, those processes do need that swap, so
in practice swapoff will probably fail or hang or cause OOM kills instead.
