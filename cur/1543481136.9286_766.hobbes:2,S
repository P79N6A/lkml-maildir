I believe the attached version gets the job done. Note that the goal
is not (was not) "write release notes" or "write Linux FAQ".
We already have Documentation/Changes and a perfectly good FAQ.
I'm also expecting a humorous and/or technical announcement from Linus.
Please don't ask him to waste time approving/condemning a press release.
He has far more important - and interesting perhaps - things to do.

LINUX KERNEL 2.2
The Internet, January XX, 1999
Today Linus Torvalds, leader of the Linux kernel development team,
releases a major update to the Linux operating system. The new release
brings enterprise scalability, broad support for newer hardware, and a
large collection of low-level features. Highlights include:
* Advanced network routing and WAN support, which gives Linux the
  ability to replace many expensive proprietary network devices.
  Users can take control of their intranet with priority traffic,
  usage limits, firewalls, accounting, and virtual private networks.
* Strong 256-bit encryption, available as an add-on component
  uncompromised by US export restrictions. Linux protects both
  network infrastructure and hard disk storage, including swap space.
* Enterprise-level network filesystem support, complete with data
  replication for performance, mobility, and extreme reliability.
  File server destruction need not and should not stop business.
* Video conferencing and recording support, TV tuner support,
  enhanced audio support, and other exciting multimedia enhancements.
* Support for a wider variety of parallel port devices including
  disk drives, tape drives, and other easy-to-use external devices.
* Greater performance than the already legendary linux 2.0, especially while
  under heavy load or while running on computers with multiple processors.
  As part of Beowulf, Linux is a leading choice for cluster computing.
* Easy access to documents stored on NTFS-format hard disks.
  This NT compatibility support provides an upgrade path to Linux.
As of now, technical users can download this update from the Internet.
Business users will get a fully supported copy when Linux vendors
ship complete integrated systems containing the update on easy-to-use
CD-ROM distributions.
BACKGROUND
Linux is a secure network operating system for demanding users.
It interoperates well with a wide variety of other systems.
Linux takes advantage of modern PC and PowerMac hardware and gives
new life to older 486-based computers. With Euro currency support
and Y2K compliance, Linux is ready for the next millennium.
Linux support is widely available via both traditional contracts
and cost-effective Internet groups. Linux is provided under an
unlimited-use license that lets users make in-house customizations
to the system itself. Linux makes over 25 percent of all web servers
work, more than any other operating system. Initial estimates suggest
that Linux has 20 million users worldwide. With its 212% growth rate
in 1998, Linux is the fastest growing server operating system.
In a competitive examination of Linux conducted by Microsoft Corporation,
Vinod Valloppillil writes that Linux is "Trusted in mission criticial
environments. Linux has been deployed in mission critical, commercial
environments with an excellent pool of public testimonials." He or his
coauther Josh Cohen also state that Linux "is trusted in mission critical
applications, and - due to it's open source code - has a long term
credibility which exceeds many other competitive OS's."
"I'm no longer nervous talking to enterprise customers about Linux,"
John Paul, Senior Vice President at Netscape Communications, told Wired.
Linus Torvalds, native to Finland, lives with his family in the
Silicon Valley. He and his Linux development team created
and maintain Linux as a labor of love.  Their devotion to software
quality has created a world-class operating system adopted by
large enterprises, small businesses, governments, educational
institutions, and home users alike.
