No such luck, I fear, at least not with egcs-2.91.66:
/usr/src/linux-2.4.3ac5/include/asm/rwsem.h:26: badly punctuated
parameter list in #define'
/usr/src/linux-2.4.3ac5/include/asm/rwsem.h: In function 'down_read':
/usr/src/linux-2.4.3ac5/include/asm/rwsem.h:52: warning: implicit
declaration of function 'rwsemdebug'
I went in and #if 0'd around the #ifdef at line 26 and uncommented the
corresponding lines in "old gcc" and it worked fine.  Do gcc and egcs
really not define anything source could #ifdef to figure out to which
compiler it's being submitted?  Yuk!
