In theory, -O2 should produce faster code.
In practice, I don't know about any recent benchmarks comparing -Os/-O2 
kernels.
In practice, I doubt it would make any noticable difference if the 
kernel might be faster by let's say 1% with one option compared to the 
other one.
The main disadvantage of -Os is that it's much less tested for kernel 
compilations, and therefore miscompilations are slightly more likely.
