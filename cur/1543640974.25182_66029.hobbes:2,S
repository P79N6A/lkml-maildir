As I already posted 3 days ago I had severe trouble getting my mouse 
going on my new system... now I recompiled the whole system with gcc 
2.95.3 instead of 3.2 and switched back to kernel 2.4.18 and that solved 
the problem. Neither using gcc 3.2 with kernel 2.4.18 nor using gcc 
2.95.3 with kernel 2.4.19 did work. Both times pressing numlock killed 
the mouse and restarting gpm afterwards killed the keyboard.
Just wanted to tell you in case this is indeed a kernel problem...
