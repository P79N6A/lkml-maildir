That won't work. There is always something that makes it impossible to have 
an entire mail with patch fit in 76 cols (unless you uuencode), simply 
because the diff headers like the ===, --- and +++ lines may be longer, the 
more even when a timestamp is provided.
However, I do not vote against timestamps, but diff puts them automatically 
in and I am fine with all that.
