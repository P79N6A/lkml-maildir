Geert is correct that the functions are generic. The fb_putcs() and
fb_setfont() can be compared to Tile blitting.  Tile blitting is a
common operation in some games such as Warcraft, Starcraft, and most
RPG's. I'm think there is Tile Blitting support in DirectFB.
In a tile-based game, the basic unit is a Tile which is just a bitmap
with a predefined width and height. The game has several tiles stored in
memory each with it's own unique id.  To draw the background/layer, a
TileMap is constructed which is basically another array.  Its format is
something like this -  TileMap[x] = y which means draw Tile y at screen
position x.
In the fbcon perspective, we can think of each character as a Tile, and
fontdata as the collection of tiles. fb_char.data is basically a
TileMap.  Of course, tile blitting in games is more complicated than
this, since games have multiple layers for the background, so layer
position, transparency, etc has to be considered.
So maybe if we can rename fb_putcs() to fb_tileblit(), fb_setfont() to
fb_loadtiles(), struct fb_chars to struct fb_tilemap and struct
fb_fontdata to struct fb_tiledata, maybe it will be more acceptable?
It can be even be expanded by including fb_tiledata.depth
fb_tiledata.cmap so we can support multi-colored tiled blitting.
