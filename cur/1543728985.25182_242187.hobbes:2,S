I would rather see --option=xyz than option xyz.  End users are going to 
be using it in scripts and in the event a parameter becomes "", then it 
will become --option1= --option2=def instead of option1 option2 def.  I 
would find it easier to parse, --option= is easy to ignore, option 
option has to be recognized as an empty option instead of using option 
as the first option's argument.
Just my opinion,
