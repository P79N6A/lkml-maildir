Can you please put the details on how the fixmap is managed into
an asm-i386/* file. x86-64 shares the i386 PCI subsystem and I would
like to use a different implement a different method there (just mapping 
everything statically)

It would be better to printk here because nobody will check the return
value of this function
Same for _write.

I thought the consensus was that reading the same address is dangerous
because some registers react when they are only read.
Also you cannot readl on a w or b registers, if you do that you would
need to use the same size.
Also are you sure that the old port based config read/write functions
actually flushed their writes? I don't think they did.  It probably
would be best to just drop that read.
Otherwise it should read some save register in the same mapping.

Shouldn't there a pci_probe option for this here?
It would be probably better to add some way to turn this off at runtime,
since it's still experimental and most drivers will probably work
with the old methods for now.

This would be somewhat cleaner in an standard function that returns
the cfg space size for a device, especially since this code is often duplicated
in your patch.

Declarations don't need to be #ifdefed.
