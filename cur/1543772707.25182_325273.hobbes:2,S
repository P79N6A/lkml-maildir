I understand what you're saying, but based on the feedback
PREEMPT_RT has gotten up until now, and now outright suggestions
that the debate is not even relevant to the LKML, I think that
some people are trying to give those interested a hint: integration
with mainline code is NOT on the agenda.
Some may want to continue trying to force-feed mainstream
maintainers. I can't stop anyone from trying, that's for sure.
However, I think what I'm suggesting is a reasonable compromise:
mainstream maintainers don't need to care about RT on a day-to-
day basis and the RT folks get to be part of mainline.
That said, please make sure you've carefully read through what
I suggest. I'm not saying that everything inside the kernel needs
to be duplicated. I'm saying that what add-ons are should be
separate. For example, like I was first saying, headers in
include/linux-hrt would point back to include/linux-srt where
appropriate.
And like I said earlier, this suggestion would need to be refined.
