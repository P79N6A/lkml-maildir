My best guess for a Linux winmodem solution for Linux is three pieces:
The existing Lucent (and other) hardware work (by Pavel/Richard/Jamie/others?)
Rogier Wolff's user space serial driver code, and
A work called "modem" by a now-deceased scientist at SGI(IIRC).  Alan
pointed me to the last piece.  'modem' handles up to 14.4k speed, and
supports some error correcting protocols we all remember from the BBS
days.
Just need someone to glue those pieces together... and you have a
winmodem driver with the proper portions in userspace, and the proper
portions in kernel space.
