Hello!

Why did you disable bith sacks and timestamps? Exactly to get
maximal damage from long delay link?

No patches to block send required ACKs exist of course. :-)
All the problem is at sender, it mispredicts rtt.
What OS is sender? If it is linux too, try to use default configuration
not playing with /proc/sys/net/tcp_*, especially with timestamps
and sacks and the situation should rectify.
Also, please, send full (binary!) tcpdump from SYN and to FIN.
Andi says right thing, but I am still puzzled why rtt is miscalculated
it should be estimated correctly.
Well, and if sender is not linux... no ideas.
