Not the "Undo ***" and "Disorder ***" ones".
But this one is curious:
 > udp v4 hw csum failure.                                                                   
Oh, I think I know why this happens.  Can you add this patch, and next
time the UDP bad csum message appears, tell me if it says "UDP packet
with bad csum was fragmented." in the next line of your syslog
messages?  Thanks.
Later,
