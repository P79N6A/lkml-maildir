This seems to help quite a bit.

I no longer have to renice both X and Gforce to achieve a perfect
display when they are sharing my box with a make -j2.  X is displaying
everything it's being fed beautifully with no help.  I have to renice
Gforce (amarok_libvisual), but given it's very heavy CPU usage, that
seems perfectly fine.
No regressions noticed so far.  Box is _very_ responsive under load,
seemingly even more so than with previous releases.  That is purely
subjective, but the first impression was very distinct.
