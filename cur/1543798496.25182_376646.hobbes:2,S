Yeah, I confuse the two. Although by now I've gotten so used to DECLARE_ 
that at least me personally I like it.

Heh. At least there's only 310 DECLARE_MUTEX* references in the whole 
kernel. So we're not actually talking about a huge patch. 
It's also fairly simple to work with in out-of-tree drivers, since it's 
always bound to be a #define, so you can do things like
	#ifndef DECLARE_SEM_MUTEX
	#define DECLARE_SEM_MUTEX(x) DECLARE_MUTEX(x)
	#endif
or something.
