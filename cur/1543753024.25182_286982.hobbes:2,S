Subject: ppc64 xics.c: what is smp_threads_ready exactly used for?

Hi Anton,
during a cleanup, I stumbled upon the following:
arch/ppc64/kernel/smp.c (in 2.6.11-rc1-mm1) says:
        /* XXX fix this, xics currently relies on it - Anton */
        smp_threads_ready = 1;
arch/ppc64/kernel/xics.c is the _only_ place in the whole kernel where 
smp_threads_ready is actually used, and this is the _only_ place where 
smp_threads_ready ever changes it's value on ppc64.
I have to admit I'm a bit lost in the sequence of function calls on 
ppc64. Is it possible to make any assumptions about the ordering of the 
assignment and the usage of smp_threads_ready?
TIA
Adrian
