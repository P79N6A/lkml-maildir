Yep.  Appear.

But who will look?  and will they care?

I don't think so.
Unmounting always passes a list to prune_dcache, so dentry_unused
doesn't get emptied, so shrink_dcache_memory will not get confused.
If there are two concurrent calls to shrink_dcache_memory, then one
will find an empty list and do nothing, and it appears this is
possible - there is no locking between callers to shrink_slab.
That's probably not fatal, but it isn't ideal (I expect....).
I guess I don't need to create a separate list.  It seemed cleaner but
does have this awkwardness.
The following patch on top of the previous one changes that behaviour.
I'm wondering now if maybe we should really have two different
'prune_dcache' functions.
One that works on a private list and doesn't bother with
DCACHE_REFERENCED or s_umount, and one that works on the global list
and does the awkward stuff.  I might try that later and see what it
looks like.
