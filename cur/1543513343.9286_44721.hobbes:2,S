To someone interested in such things.
It says 'Cannot Quiesce iop0' or something, then fails to initialise.
Dpt firmware is 211D (latest)
Server is Compaq Proliant 800
Kernel compiled for SMP, with one processor installed.
The 2.2.5 kernel with the Dpt supplied patch (v1.06) works fine in this
hardware.
Sorry, I have no ability to debug.
Regards
John
