The transport really refers to the physical cabling.  iSCSI is
SCSI-over-IP, SAS is Serial Attached SCSI, SPI is Parallel SCSI and FC
is Fibre Channel.  It seems to me from your website that you're
using SATA-II drives, so you'll want to look at the SAS template for
exposing cabling details.
You missed one useful class though, the raid_function_template, which
you almost certainly want to use.  See drivers/scsi/raid_class.c and
include/linux/raid_class.h.  It's early days for the RAID class, so you
may wish to extend it to meet your needs.
James, I presume it's been mis-placed for convenience and it'll move to
block/ or drivers/block/ at some point?
