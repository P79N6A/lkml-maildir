The following, between two systems using Linux 2.2.1:
	mount skunkworks:/ /mnt
	tar -clf /dev/null /mnt
Eventually results in a low memory situation on the serving node.
This prevents login from executing.
If a task remains logged in, `cat proc/meminfo` shows more and
more swap being used, plus less and less free memory. Eventually
I get a "can't fork" error. The problem seems to be when the
free pages get below 740k. This is the last number I am able to
see before the "can't fork" error.
The problem is reversible, i.e., there doesn't seem to be a memory
leak, only that the free pages are allowed to get a bit too low.
I think that if the lower limit is adjusted upwards a bit, this
problem will not exist.
FYI, changes in 'mm' improved the performance. A kernel compile
now takes 120 seconds, down from 300.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
