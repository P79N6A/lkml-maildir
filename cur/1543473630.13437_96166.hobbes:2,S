telling ordinary users to read Documentation/oops-tracing.txt just
confuses most people. It's a description for kernel hackers currently. 
Maybe put this to the top of the document: 
---------------->
QuickStart: if you simply want to report an oops, just do:
	cd /usr/src/linux/scripts
	g++ -o ksymoops ksymoops.cc
	./ksymoops ../System.map < the_oops.txt
and send the output to linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu, with a small
description how this happened. (but send it even if you know nothing about
it, it might help us to find very rare bugs only happening on your
system!)
the remaining part of this document tells you what to do if you want to do
some debugging yourself:
<---------------
(btw. the comment in your patch is i think pretty offensive, we cannot
require users to understand oopses at first sight)
