kexec should handle.
        1. multiprocessor x86 (p3, p4, +xeons) with APICs
        2. >4GB memory
        3. >= 2.5.x kernel
        4. potentially non-x86.

Interesting.  I know I have it runs on the 2-way P4-Xeon under my
desk.  So maybe it is a compiler bug, or some weird firmware case I
don't handle correctly.

Sure it will, if it only allocates the memory from the low 4GB, in fact
my kexec code makes certain to allocate memory from the kernel address
space.  get_free_page() in ZONE_NORMAL.  This is the low 896MB.  So
there shouldn't be a problem.  This was done very deliberately so it
would work on these kinds of systems.

I totally agree.  Walking the driver tree is exactly what I want.
Disabling bus masters is just a quick hack to rule out a DMA killing
your linux booting linux.

Interesting.  So far I haven't seen a system that supports CPU hot
plug, on x86 so I have no clue here.
