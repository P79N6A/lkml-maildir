find -type f | xargs chmod ugo-w 
whenever you make a new copy seems to work pretty well to me. 
Then you use "dupvi" to edit the files, which is just a little wrapper that
breaks the link, and edits the file. 
For added paranoia, I suppose you could make your "main" views (eg the
unpatched ones) owned by another user. But I've never had a problem with
just chmod, and I have a lot of views ... 1689 all linked together ;-)

Oh, and diff of views takes < 1s (diff understands hardlinks too, it seems).
Any SCM can kiss my ass ;-)
