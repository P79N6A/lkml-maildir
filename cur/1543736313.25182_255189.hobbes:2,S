I have a graphics card which requires two four pin molex power connectors, 
going back in time there have allway been certain perphiral cards which 
required external (non-bus supplied power sources for whatever reason) 
(hard-drive on a card, sparc on a card, pc on a card, early 90's hardware 
mpeg encoder, data collection device, remote mangement card, graphics card 
in modern mac etc), it's obviously not a general solution, but it's been 
done frequently enough that it shouldn't just be discarded out of hand.
