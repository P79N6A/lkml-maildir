I agree with most of that. I thought of doing that change, but didn't
want to have the powerpc code stuck behind a huge pile of driver
changes.
My only other worry is that at some point we'll get a driver that does
want to choose the entries it's allocated, and at that point we'll have
to put back the msix_entry code (or something similar). I don't have any
idea of when/if that sort of hardware/driver requirement is likely to
surface though, if it's "not for a while" it might be worth ripping out
the complexity until we really need it.

I think nvec should stay.

I'm happy to move it to the end of the series. I'm also happy to stop
passing the msix_entry into the arch.
But I don't want to predicate the merge of our powerpc stuff on the
removal of msix_entry entirely, there's too much risk that we'll slip to
v23.
