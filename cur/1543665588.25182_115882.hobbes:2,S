Replying to myself :)
The patch was already part of my tree as I had grabbed the latest
bk stuff from v2.5/testing/cset which means my oops is still unresolved.
I see there is a another oops that looks very much that same that
was posted by CaT <cat@zip.com.au> .. CC'ed in case the above notes
help.
