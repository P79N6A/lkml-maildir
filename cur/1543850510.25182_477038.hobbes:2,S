Yeah, I think my brain made the leap to spurious wake-ups from hashed
wait queues.  Which aren't being used :).  As long as it's a private
wait queue and sleeps and sleeps with UNINTERRUPTIBLE it seems ok.
Do you think the cleanup shouldn't be done?  It seems easier to
understand after the patch, and makes dio_await_one() pretty darn
straight forward.
