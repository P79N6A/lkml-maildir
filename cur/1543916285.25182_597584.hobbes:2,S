It is slightly earlier than 2.6.22 (outside the '/* now count some
things */' loop) to make sure the R5_Wantfill flags from the last
request have been cleared before starting a new one:
		/* maybe we can request a biofill operation
		 *
		 * new wantfill requests are only permitted while
		 * STRIPE_OP_BIOFILL is clear
		 */
		if (test_bit(R5_UPTODATE, &dev->flags) && dev->toread &&
			!test_bit(STRIPE_OP_BIOFILL, &sh->ops.pending))
			set_bit(R5_Wantfill, &dev->flags);

Ok, the tree is updated with 'Reviewed-by' tags and the proposed
documentation updates from Randy and Shannon.
