I over simplified.  data=ordered means that all data blocks are written before 
the metadata that references them commits.
So, if you add 1GB to a fileA in a transaction and then run fsync(fileB) in 
the same transaction, the 1GB from fileA is sent to disk (and waited on) 
before the fsync on fileB returns.
