Linus Torvalds <torvalds@transmeta.com>:
: Then you come back, and you have created various new patches while you
: were away (making versions 2.3.129 and 2.3.130), so you just synch it all
: back (and now the complete version contains everything from 2.2.x to
: 2.3.130) 
: 
: With the collapsed version, you wouldn't have version information, but
: hey, that's cool, you just wanted a temporary smaller repository anyway.
I went off and did the numbers, which is what I should have done up
front.  I can do better than that and with one heck of a lot less work.
Here are the numbers.  Suppose you went through a big source base such
as the kernel, which had 10 years of history.  For each file, dig out
each of the following sizes:
	gotten file (i.e., checked out version)
	revision history file (RCS or SCCS, they are about the same)
	gzip -4 < revision history file
You will get ratios like
	3.8	gotten file
	7.65	SCCS file
	1	gzipped SCCS file
So what's that tell us?  The top of trunk checked version is approximately
1/2 the size of the entire revision control file.  So even if I pruned
all the way up to the top of trunk, we get a 50% savings.
On the other hand, if we gzip -4 the SCCS file, we get almost a 4x space
savings, or a space savings of 75% instead of 50% to put in the same
terms as above.
The cool things are
	- I can give you guys all the revision history
	- the size on disk is 1/2 what it would be compared to the pruned
	  SCCS file and 1/4 what it would be compared to the uncompressed
	  SCCS file (this is a win in terms of disk I/O).
	- it is way less work for me (I am particularly fond of this point)
So, sorry to rattle your cage about sizes, I should have ran these
numbers first, but they are very strongly pointing towards compression.
I just went and did some timings to make sure gzip is fast enough.
I can uncompress a 1.2 MB file (from .2M -> 1.2M) in 100 milliseconds
(aka an effective rate of 12MB/sec) on a 300Mhz K6.  Going the other
way is slower, about 4MB/sec.  But that's reasonable, it means that a
reasonably high end machine can keep up with the disk arm.
So this long rant says compression rocks.  Did I miss anything?
