I'm worried somebody needed to disable LP_CAREFUL to print, probably it's not a
big deal to keep it. About the lp_wait_ready that's what I had in mind with the
"rework" thing and it looks fine. However parport_write can still could silenty
discard data, but maybe it can't notice errors with some handshake. I didn't
checked the details of the DMA based handshake so Tim needs to comment if
this can be considered a final/right fix (I hope it's not ;).
