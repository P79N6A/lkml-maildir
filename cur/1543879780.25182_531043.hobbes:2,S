Exactly.

The original report was about the temperature sensors of K8 cpus. It
happens that ACPI reads the sensors while the linux driver is using it
and gets garbage (and shut down the system). The problem is more
generic though, and applies to all hardware monitoring chips for which
a driver exists.

Problem is that ACPI may access the sensors anyway (e.g. via SMM).

Usually ACPI exposes 1 or 2 temperature readings (CPU and
motherboard), while the hw driver can also provide fans and voltages
measurements.
Vendors usually provides a monitoring utility for Win that also
exposes these information. It's not known whether there's a way to
avoid conflicting accesses between ACPI and the raw driver; it's
possible that it's vendor-specific and not documented.
