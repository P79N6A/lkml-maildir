Hi NFS folks,
I am still fighting witn nfsd/lockd not dying upon killall5.
(they are stuck in D state for 2 mins and then die with
"rpciod: active tasks at shutdown?!" at console)
I found out that nfsd and lockd die as expected when I use
modified killall5 which do not SIGSTOP all tasks before
killing them.
Any idea why this makes such difference? Is this a bug in
nfsd/lockd or in killall5?
