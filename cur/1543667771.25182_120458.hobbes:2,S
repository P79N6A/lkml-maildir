This seems odd for some systems we support. Older PARISC for example
have PCI busses hanging off gecko. I do agree with you for the general
case. So systems whose root level bridges are 'normal' should reflect
this and I guess others should attach them to the relevant bus.
Over time it seems that PCI is going to become a secondary bus like
ISA did as well. In fact it already has in many ways, its just things
like VLINK and the Intel hub busses look like PCI to us
