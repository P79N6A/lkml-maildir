_Sometimes_ that is true.  But there is no way you are going to be able to
say that that is the typical case.  History says otherwise.  I'm not saying
that rewrites aren't necessary, I'm saying that many, maybe most, aren't
necessary.

The fact that BitKeeper will read and write 30 year old SCCS files
seems to have escaped your attention.  Contrast that with the CML
debate and I think it makes my point perfectly.  If Eric's changes
worked the same way, we'd have a system which worked on the old data
and the new.
