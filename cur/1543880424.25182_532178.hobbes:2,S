I think you mean motor instead of axis, because I don't push real axes to
the devices, but motor's torques...

Ok, if this is preferred, I'll post it with the const of having more context
switches for a single effect.
This was just a realization of the idea how I though it with the
quick'n'dirty FF_RAW.
