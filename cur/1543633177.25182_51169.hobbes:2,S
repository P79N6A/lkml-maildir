What if some of the cache lines inside the DMA region are dirty and...

You really need to:
 1. write back cache lines that cross unaligned boundries
 3. invalidate the above cache lines
 2. start the DMA
 4. invalidate cache lines that are fully inside the DMA
which is precisely we do on ARM.

What's the point of (3) ?  The data in memory hasn't been changed by DMA.
What if we were writing out a page that was mmaped into a process, and
the process wrote to that page while we were DMAing ?
