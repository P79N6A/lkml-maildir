I don't disagree with most of your point, however there certainly are
legitimate uses for big boxes with small (IDE) disk. Those which first
come to mind are all computational problems, in which a small dataset is
read from disk and then processors beat on the data. More or less common
examples are graphics transformations (original and final data
compressed), engineering calculations such as finite element analysis,
rendering (raytracing) type calculations, and data analysis (things like
setiathome or automated medical image analysis).
IDE drives are very cost effective, and low cost motherboard RAID is
certainly useful for preserving the results of large calculations on small
(relatively) datasets.
