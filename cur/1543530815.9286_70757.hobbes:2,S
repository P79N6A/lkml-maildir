Hi everyone,
I'm having great difficulty finding a solution to my current problem:
 -  I need to boot linux, installed >8GB into my harddisk.
I know the current version 12 of LILO doesn't support this (even in linear
mode). Werner?
Is there any solution? Anyone know of other bootloaders?
Help would be great
     - Dan
