I don't actually show it in the above code snippet but, I do copy data
into the buffer pointed by pMsgBuf. The first four bytes is a long which
take a value between 1 and 20. 
The actual data follows the four bytes. The amount of data copied is
specified by iPacketLen. My buffer is actually iPacketLen+4 bytes in
size. (The guard band of four bytes before and after the buffer is
actually not used and is only there to detect this error.)
Any other Ideas?
