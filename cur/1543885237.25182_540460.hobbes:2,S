Subject: [PATCH] Make bootsector stub 16-bit-only (i386)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi!
The x86 bzImage contains a stub to inform people that it is not possible
any more to run a Linux kernel by catting it to a floppy and then
booting from it. This was meant to be all 16-bit code. The first
instruction, however, ended up as being coded as a 16:32-bit far jump. I
assume the intention was a 16:16-bit far jump.
This patch changes only i386.
Greetings,
	Alexander
