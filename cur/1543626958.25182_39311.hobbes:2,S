Hmm, cpuinfo is a very human readable file, I wouldn't use it to do
things like that.
I suggest /proc/stat whose format appears to be designed for machine
reading and which has a 'cpu0' and 'cpu1' line on this here dual
processor box; and from 2.4.x on it seems to have a cpu0 even on
uniprocessor; so I suggest:
grep "^cpu[0-9][0-9]* " /proc/stat
But I'd actually go and ask the CPU hotswap guys - they must have a way
of getting a handle on this (hey does that mean you might have cpu0,
cpu1, cpu3 .... ?)
Me thinks the format of these /proc files needs documenting - is there
anything already?
