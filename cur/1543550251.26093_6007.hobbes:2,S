In 99% of the cases sector size is 512 on the media/platter.
Until GLOBS (can not remember the name) is adopted the idea of physical
v/s logical sector size on the media is fixed (99%).

But because of the nature of your request and the method of opening the
device, would that not just wrap around the detected capacity?

Now we are closer.  Openning a device even raw and going through the drive
will prevent you from getting there, sorry.  That is how it works.  The
top level of the driver that mates with the list_head is bound and limited
to what it found.

But there is a transfer limit per request.
So you hit the limit of the known/reported drive, provide you did not
crash the kernel by lying to it, do the partition tables remain in tack?
If the fall appart because of false boundaries we have a bigger mess.
To prevent this you have to get under the driver to the actual IO point.
Will have to finish in the morning (after sun up), sorry.
