Why have the "MUTEX" part in there?  Shouldn't that just be DECLARE_SEM
(oops, I mean DEFINE_SEM).  Especially that MUTEX_LOCKED! What is that?
How does a MUTEX start off as locked.  It can't, since a mutex must
always have an owner (which, by the way, helped us in the -rt patch to
find our "compat_semaphores").  So who's the owner of a
DEFINE_SEM_MUTEX_LOCKED?
