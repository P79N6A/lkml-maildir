You are *out of your fscking mind*.
Why are you running 2.5 on a machine that has anything worth
recovering on it? IDE or SCSI, no matter.
Standard 2.5 equipment includes a CD drive with the install disk(s)
for $DISTRO ready to drop into the drive as soon as anything looks
bad. Advanced 2.5 requires a duplicate hard disk on a removable drive
caddy :)
