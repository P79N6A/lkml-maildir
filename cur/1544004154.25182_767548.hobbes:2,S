Hi,
   It worked! It takes 10 minutes to boot, but it gets speedy somewhere in the 
booting process. I checked the memory speed with "stream" and its working.
   Just for the record, I had to change the line in /etc/inittab 
to "mtrr:345:once:/root/mtrrfixup.sh" or else, init would complain about the 
first field being more than 4 characters.
   Thank you very much
