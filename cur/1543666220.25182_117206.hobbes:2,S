The bios isn't the way to go. Unless the bios coders puts an _ordinary_ 
linux kernel module in their eprom.
If the kernel knew how to restore the video state itself - that'd be 
something.  Go complain to those who keeps such knowledge secret.
And no, they won't risk their company on providing such information.
Setting the modes is such a tiny little piece of what a graphichs
card do.  (Providing full information on how to program the
accelerator chips wouldn't kill them either...)
