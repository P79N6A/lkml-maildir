Several in tree, GPL'd modules did so.  I'm not aware of out of tree 
modules that do that, and if they do, they are misbehaving.  
Reprogramming MTRR memory regions under the kernel's nose is not a 
proper way to behave, and this is the most benign use I can think of for 
write access to MSRs.  If this really breaks any code out there, then 
there should be a proper, controlled API to do this so the kernel can 
manage it.

Yes, but halting is a behavior that can easily introduce critical, grind 
to a halt problems because of race conditions.  I have no problems 
having modules implement alternative halt loops.  I think there is a 
serious debuggability issue with binary modules invoking halt directly.
