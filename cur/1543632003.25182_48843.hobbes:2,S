This camera doesn't use the mass storage driver (you don't show any log 
lines that indicate the driver claiming the device).  Instead I'd try 
the drivers under "USB Multimedia Devices" (you need v4l support).  A 
quick look doesn't look hopeful, but maybe one of those drivers will 
claim the device.  Anybody on LKML know for sure?
