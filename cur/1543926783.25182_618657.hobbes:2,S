It'd be helpful to see others (especially kprobes maintainers) chime in
on this.  In particular, if doing kmalloc/kfree of GFP_ATOMIC data at
kretprobe-hit time is OK, as in Abhishek's approach, then we could also
use GFP_ATOMIC (or at least GFP_NOWAIT) allocations to make up the
difference when we run low on kretprobe_instances.
More comments below.

... which is zero for kretprobes that don't use the data pouch.

What bloat?  On my 32-bit system, the pouch to hold struct prof_data in
your test_module example would be 20 bytes.  (For comparison,
sizeof(struct kretprobe_instance) = 28, btw.)  Except for functions like
schedule(), where a lot of tasks can be sleeping at the same time, an
rp->maxactive value of 5 or 10 is typically plenty.  That's 100-200
bytes of "bloat" spent at registration time (GFP_KERNEL), at least some
of which will be saved at probe-hit time (GFP_ATOMIC).  (And if somebody
says, "I always use a much higher value of rp->maxactive," then he/she's
probably not really worried about bloat.)

But as noted in my review of your sample module, hand-crafted, per-hit
allocation is more expensive both in terms of execution time and code
size/complexity.

Yes.  If the pouch idea is too weird, then the data pointer is a good
compromise.
With the above reservations, your enclosed patch looks OK.
You should provide a patch #2 that updates Documentation/kprobes.txt.
Maybe that will yield a little more review from other folks.

Got it.  Thanks.  I've already commented.
