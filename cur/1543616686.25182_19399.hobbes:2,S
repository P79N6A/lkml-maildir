I think that the recent changes (in 2.4.18pre2) in
parport code broke the PLIP code. I will undo the
changes in parport.c and test tomorow so hopefully I
will follow up with much more information in case my
hunch misguides me or an explicit modification which
triggers the problem for my setup.
In the mean time may I ask:
Is this already known? Should I address to a different
list/person?
I am not subscribed to the list but I will read any
answers from the WWW archives.
Thank you for your time
  .Bill
