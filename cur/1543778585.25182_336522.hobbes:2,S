This would be the root case.  8250 is _never_ supposed to fail with
ENODEV, even if it doesn't detect any devices itself.  And doesn't
fail like this.

serial8250_init does not contain any such message, so you're not
running a mainline kernel, but some patched version.  Are these
patches available somewhere?
I guess these patches are your problem, and it seems that there's
at least one which is completely unnecessary or inappropriate.
