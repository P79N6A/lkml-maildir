But this looks like the driver from when it was broken... it has all the
on-screen garbage when I boot. however, that cursor erraticness is gone
thanks to the old driver :)
I don't think going back to old stuff is the right way to think about
stuff like this :/
Kernel 2.5.66-mm3 contained a radeonfb.c which had the cursor issues but
fixed the problem with the bootup junk on the screen.
