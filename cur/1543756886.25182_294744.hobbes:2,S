I also have low write performance (around 300 kb/s) with several 2.6
kernels (2.6.7 to 2.6.9-mm1) and I can hear the head jump around when I
use ext2 or UDF. It will be fast when written directly to the device
without a file system using dd.  The drive is a LG GSA-4040B. I tried
several media types from Panasonic and EMTEC.
I'll try to test if the problem disappears with 2.6.6.
