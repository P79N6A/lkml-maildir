The real problem with going to a newsgroup is not a technical one. The
problem is that readers don't scale. While it may be ok for some people to
just skim the list and read only the subjects, other people such as Alan
and the IDE maintainers, etc., end up reading a lot more of the traffic
than the rest of us, just to keep on top of the stuff they need to. They
don't scale to the size of a newsgroup.
The fix might be to create a better bug-tracking infrastructure. Can we
bring Jitterbug back? Can we use it just for bugs rather than tracking
patches? Directing most questions there might get rid of many of the more
frequently asked questions.
Email addresses are already harvested and you can just assume they will be
on any popular forum.
