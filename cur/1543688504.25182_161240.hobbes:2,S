I'm experiencing all of the problems in referenced in posts 
	"2.6.0-test4: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference"
	"2.6.0-test4-mm2: fdisk causes Oops" (I get it with Lilo)
	"2.6.0-test4 and hardware reports a non fatal incident"
Am I right in assuming that these are all related problems?  It seems that they all appeared at once, when I went to 2.6.0-test4-mm2.
And, did these get fixed with 2.6.0-test4-mm3 ?
Thanks
Garrett
