As Gérard already replied, I have the same problem on my PPC box (cfr. my
postings last month) with DDS-1 tape drive. It has 2 SCSI adapters (MESH and
Sym53c875), and it seems to happen with the '875 only (but the MESH sucks
anyway and has other problems making it unusable for my DDS-1).
In my case, the 32 bad bytes are always a copy of the 32 bytes 10K before (10K
= blocksize of tar). Can you verify that's the case for you as well? For
reference, I have approx. 6 sequences of corrupted data when writing 256 MB to
tape. Reading gives no problems.
The problem does not appear in 2.2.13 (yep, that's old, but so far the latest
2.2.x kernel that runs on my CHRP LongTrail). I have to fix later kernels
first.
