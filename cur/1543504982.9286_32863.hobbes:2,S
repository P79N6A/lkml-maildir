I have a 2.0.36  kernel (which works with 2.3.*) which is using dhcp...
I'm getting a message
	modprobe can't find net-pf-17
and dhcp fails...
What is net-pf-17?
Is there a table of what net-pf-xx means? (I know appletalk and ipx are 4 and 
5).
Can more meaningful messages be displayed (this is fundamentally a redhat 5.2
system).
