If that is the case, why the introduction of EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL and
MODULE_LICENSE()?
Specifying explicit boundaries for the module interface has legitimised
binary-only modules.
This was the signal to developers of proprietary code that binary-only
modules are tolerable.
Note that I said tolerable, not acceptable. Ref also the 'tainted' flag
("man 8 insmod")
My personal view is that Linux should mandate GPL for all modules in 2.6 and
beyond.
The Kevin Dankwardt article gives an alternative perspective for Linux
embedded use:
