I like this patch -- I recently built a kernel with PAGE_OFFSET
0xb0000000 to avoid highmem on my box with 1G of RAM, based on recent
discussion, and I made the same change to vmlinux.lds.S (although
since <asm-i386/thread_info.h> includes <asm-i386/page.h>, I didn't
bother adding the "#include <asm/page.h>" line).
In any case it seems there is at least one more place where 0xc0000000
is hardcoded in arch/i386.  The patch below uses PAGE_OFFSET instead
of 0xc0000000 in doublefault.c's ptr_ok() macro.
