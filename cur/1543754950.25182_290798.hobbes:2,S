Next year we are going to see a lot of multiple VGAs. Depending on
configuration the Nvidia4 chipset can support from one up to eight PCI
Express video cards simultaneously.
I would like to get this fixed in the kernel so that apps like X won't
do it from user space. Every time X does a read/alter/write to PCI
config space from user space is a place where bad things can happen.
The goal of this is to remove the PCI bus probing code from X.
