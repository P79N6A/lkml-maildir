I had thought that since the aliases were spelled out that the alias to be
used for each module was fixed.
/usr/include/linux/ppp-comp.h
#define CI_BSD_COMPRESS	21	/* config. option for BSD-Compress */
#define CI_DEFLATE_DRAFT	24	/* value used in original draft RFC */
#define CI_DEFLATE		26	/* config option for Deflate */
Thank you for the correction.
