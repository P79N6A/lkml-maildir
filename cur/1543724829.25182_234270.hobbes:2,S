FWIW, g++ defines NULL to the __null GCC-extension keyword, that
issues a warning if it's doesn't decay to a pointer type, but behaves
like the integral constant of value 0 otherwise, as required by the
C++ standard.
I suppose Linux might benefit from such an extension implemented in C
as well.  Well, looks like sparse already takes care of that, and GCC
has entered an new-extension-avoidance mode (or mood? :-) a few years
ago.
