Hello,
rivafb still doesn't work on my card, but that isn't surprising :
root(pts/7)@saphir:~(102Ko) # lspci -vvn -s 01:00.0

This card is a Geforce4 440 MX.
please note the 10de:0181, whereas in includes/linux/pci_ids.h we have :
#define PCI_DEVICE_ID_NVIDIA_GEFORCE4_MX_440    0x0171
So I tried to replace 0171 with 0181, and the card was detected, but the
frame buffer still doesn't work (blank screen for most resolutions,
corrupted screen for some).
Also, What is that subsystem 1043:80bb (Asustek:device not-known) ?
Should I provide more informataions about my card ?
I'm ready to test any patch needed.
Thanks,
