It is because I wanted to ensure that it matched exactly the limits of the
functions that we call. And since msec_to_jiffies() is defined in 3 possible
ways depending on HZ, 1000 % HZ and HZ % 1000, there are 3 different limits.
Then, once the msec_to_jiffies() function is fixed, it's valuable to use it
in ep_poll(), because its worst case does exactly what you already have
(timeout * HZ + 999) / 1000, and other optimal cases can do better (for
HZ=100, 250, 1000, there will be no divide at all).
Don't worry, in my case, gcc also produces a single constant. That's just
that it depends on how it will be used (check include/linux/jiffies.h,
you'll understand what I mean).

Willy
