It's not an assignment operator. The fact that you 'could' use
it as one is not relevant. For instance, using XOR you can
exchange the values of two operands. However, you would not
really like a 'C' compiler to do that. Instead, you would
expect it to stash some invisible temporary variable some-
where, hopefully in a register. If you really want to
swap values using the ^ operator, then you can code it yourself.
Wana play?
int main()
{
    int a, b;
    a = 0xaaaaaaaa;
    b = 0xbbbbbbbb;
   printf("a = %08x b = %08x \n", a, b);
// Swap
   a ^= b;
   b ^= a;
   a ^= b;
   printf("a = %08x b = %08x \n", a, b);
    return 0;
}
The generated code is awful:
	movl -8(%ebp),%edx
	xorl %edx,-4(%ebp)
	movl -4(%ebp),%edx
	xorl %edx,-8(%ebp)
	movl -8(%ebp),%edx
	xorl %edx,-4(%ebp)
	movl -8(%ebp),%eax
gcc doesn't care that some xchg operations are atomic. If there
was an 'atomic_t' type that 'C' (generically) knew about, then
the code-generator might try to find some strange sequence that
would perform 64-bit atomic operations on a 32-bit processor as
a side-effect, which is what it is with the compare/exchange-8-bytes
opcode.
