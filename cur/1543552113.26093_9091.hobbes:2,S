sock_write and sock_read contain:
	if(size==0)		/* Match SYS5 behaviour */
		return 0;
I'm not sure which other read()/write() functions are used by
"networking things", but I don't see any others sendto would map to.
So I suspect if there are any applications which would need the behaviour
you described they've already been broken, and should be recompiled to use
sys_send(|to|msg) (via sys_socketcall on x86, of course).

I would suspect most of those have been eliminated by now.

As I'm reading it, they're talking about every read() call, even those with
an invalid fd.
