The patch csa-accounting-taskstats-update.patch in current -mm kernels
(whcih is planned for 2.6.19) does have per-process chars-read and
chars-written accounting ("Extended accounting fields").  That's probably
not waht you really want, although it might tell you what you want to know.

Sure.  Doing this is actually fairly tricky because disk writes are almost
always deferred.  We'd need to remember which process dirtied some memory,
then track that info all the way down to the disk IO level, then perform
the accounting operations at IO submit-time or completion time, on a
per-page basis.  It isn't rocket-science, but it's a lot of stuff and some
overhead.

csa-accounting-taskstats-update.patch makes that information available to
userspace.
But it's approximate, because
- it doesn't account for disk readahead
- it doesn't account for pagefault-initiated reads (althought it easily
  could - Jay?)
- it overaccounts for a process writing to an already-dirty page.
  (We could fix this too: nuke the existing stuff and do
	current->wchar += PAGE_CACHE_SIZE;
   in __set_page_dirty_[no]buffers().) (But that ends up being wrong if
   someone truncates the file before it got written)
- it doesn't account for file readahead (although it easily could)
- it doesn't account for pagefault-initiated readahead (it could)
hm.  There's actually quite a lot we could do here to make these fields
more accurate and useful.  A lot of this depends on what the definition of
these fields _is_.  Is is just for disk IO?  Is it supposed to include
console IO, or what?
