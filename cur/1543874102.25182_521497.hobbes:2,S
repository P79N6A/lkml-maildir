Here you are right, but please tell RedHat about this (and you'll be at 
least called an old-fashioned person). They (and from their initiative, 
almost everyone else) use UTF-8 based locales by default, and ONLY utf8 NLS 
gives correct characters in filenames in this case.
Besides, FS corruption is possible only if the user intentionally writes two 
files with names differing only in their case.

G_FILENAME_ENCODING is a Glib2-only heresy, please ignore it. The "ls" tool 
always assumes that file names are in the same encoding as the output of 
"locale charmap" command. The fact that the filenames (contrary to what 
Glib2 developers say) should be in the locale encoding becomes very obvious 
if one reads POSIX specifications for tar and cpio programs (otherwise, they 
won't talk about conversion errors).
