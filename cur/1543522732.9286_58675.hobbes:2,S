I see. How I found this bug: I have a new hardware which needs to be
tested, so I took 2.2.15pre3, checked as much options as I could and
started a loop of kernel compilations. And even the first compilation
didn't finished because of evident syntax error in kernel sources, so
I reported it. No, I am not interested in QNX support at all. Kernel
compilation is just a kind of benchmark for me. I simply do not trust
the new hardware which didn't passed my standard
"24-hrs-non-stop-kernel-compilation" procedure. ;)
