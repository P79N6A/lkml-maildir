Well, these are dbench numbers from December, it's
2.4.17. Unfortunately, it appears OSDL have trouble with 2.5 currently ...
FWIW, box is 8-way PIII Xeon, 700MHz, 1MB cache, 8G RAM
rat-7 is with 128-way radix tree branch factor, rat-4 is with 16-way.

The results are similar on 4-way OSDL boxen and on the 12- and 16-way
PPC64 runs by Anton Blanchard:
   # clients
   [1 - ncpu]         - linear increase in the throughput, small improvement over the
                        stock kernel, I guess we quickly hit other locks
   [ncpu - 2 * ncpu]  - flat
   [2 * ncpu, +infty) - drops down do zero

Done. rat_* -> radix_tree_*

I'll wait for a day for some more comments (e.g. Ingo) and will submit
it.
