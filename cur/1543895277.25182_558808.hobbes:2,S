I've been reading up on the Intel HD Audio specifications, and I found
that the problem is most likely that the driver has to resort to PI/O
(single_cmd) mode.  I really haven't had enough time or experience to
figure out what is actually causing this.  This is the first time I've
done any kernel development; thankfully, Intel has good documentation.
 I'm going to keep hacking to see what information I can figure out.
I just tried 2.6.22-rc5, and no behavior has changed.
