I apologize in advance if this is not quite right, having only done 
"hello world" kernel modules thus far (plus a good deal of kernel source 
browsing).  I think you need to "unfold" the interruptible_sleep_on call 
and do it yourself by adding current to the wait queue before checking 
any cards, setting current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, then checking 
all cards and if none has data, calling schedule.  When you get back 
from schedule (i.e. your ISR has received data and done a wake_up) or 
any card has data, remove yourself from the wait queue and set your 
state to runnable.  This hopefully gives you the "atomic check condition 
and sleep if not satisfied" behavior.
