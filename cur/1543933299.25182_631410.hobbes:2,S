Another year, another update!  :)
The kernel hacker's guide to git has received some updates:
	
http://linux.yyz.us/git-howto.html
This includes all the input sent to me in the past several months, as 
well as a few new tips and tricks I use on a regular basis.
In general, this document is designed to be a quick-start cookbook, and 
not a comprehensive introduction.
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to all!
