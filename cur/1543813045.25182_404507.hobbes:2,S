PPC does speculative memory accesses to IO?  Are you *sure*?

His  grammar's right ... but I'd just leave out the 'as' part.  As
you're right that it's confusing  ;-)

Yes:
#else
# define smp_mb()       barrier()
# define smp_rmb()      barrier()
# define smp_wmb()      barrier()
# define smp_read_barrier_depends()     do { } while(0)
#endif

Port space is deprecated though.  PCI 2.3 says:

3.2.5 of PCI 2.3 seems most relevant:
Since memory write transactions may be posted in bridges anywhere
in the system, and I/O writes may be posted in the host bus bridge,
a master cannot automatically tell when its write transaction completes
at the final destination. For a device driver to guarantee that a write
has completed at the actual target (and not at an intermediate bridge),
it must complete a read to the same device that the write targeted. The
read (memory or I/O) forces all bridges between the originating master
and the actual target to flush all posted data before allowing the
read to complete. For additional details on device drivers, refer to
Section 6.5. Refer to Section 3.10., item 6, for other cases where a
read is necessary.
Appendix E is also of interest:
2. Memory writes can be posted in both directions in a bridge. I/O and
Configuration writes are not posted. (I/O writes can be posted in the
Host Bridge, but some restrictions apply.) Read transactions (Memory,
I/O, or Configuration) are not posted.
5. A read transaction must push ahead of it through the bridge any posted
writes originating on the same side of the bridge and posted before
the read.  Before the read transaction can complete on its originating
bus, it must pull out of the bridge any posted writes that originated
on the opposite side and were posted before the read command completes
on the read-destination bus.
I like the way they contradict each other slightly wrt config reads and
whether you have to read from the same device, or merely the same bus.
One thing that is clear is that a read of a status register on the bridge
isn't enough, it needs to be *through* the bridge, not *to* the bridge.
I wonder if a config read of a non-existent device on the other side of
the bridge would force the write to complete ...
