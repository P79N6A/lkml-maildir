This is obviously untrue for prefixes.  Consider the prefix T (10^12),
which has no lower-case equivalent.
The unit here is B, which does conflict with the unit bel, but is
widely used to mean byte in computer contexts.
I don't like the pronunciations used in the new standard, but I think
using Ki, Mi, Gi, ... at least in writing is a good thing, to
disambiguate between binary and decimal powers.  I just read them as
"binary kilobytes" etc if I need to be clear.
