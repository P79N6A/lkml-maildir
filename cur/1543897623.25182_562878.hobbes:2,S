Because you ignored my explanations.

Read the Kdoc help text in the patch. It explains it.

No. Read this:
I will explain it once again: It is _just_ to select a default policy
of which RNG is initialized by default. The type does say _nothing_
about the entropy quality or something else. It _just_ judges about
which RNG is preferred for default initialization.
External RNG boards are preferred over internal onboard stuff; onboard
is preferred over bad RNGs like bcm43xx; bcm43xx is preferred over
devices that are not RNGs by definition but could be used as such (sensors).
