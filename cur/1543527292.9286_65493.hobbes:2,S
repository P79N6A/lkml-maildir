You can play "what if" games forever.  Sadly, what we have to deal with
here is the unfortunate situation in which the hardware is basically
bust, allowing the user to cause arbitrary amounts of mischief.  What if
the user removes the disk in the middle of write and corrupts the disk
in the process?  What if the user removes the disk and drops it in the
waste bin?  What if the user removes the disk and disappears away for a
2 week holiday?
The media can be removed at any time, with no guarantee of getting it
back.  That's the reality we have to live with, and yes, it is
unfortunate, but we have to live with this reality for the next few
years at least.

No.  If the user can remove the disk at any time, the disk can be
corrupted: removing the media during a write can trash sector
information on neighbouring tracks.  Secondly, the instructions can be
as simple as "don't remove the disk while you are still writing files to
it."  That's simple enough.
