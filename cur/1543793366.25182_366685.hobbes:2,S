I have a few doubs with the 2.6 makefile
Suppose I have the following dir structure:
		maindir
		    |
		-------
		|       |
	       subdir1 subdir2
Now both of this subdirs have many .c files which are to be compiled and
linked together to make final1.o & final2.o files in the subdirs
subdir1  & subdir2 respectively.
Now i want to link this two files subdir1/final1.o & subdir2/final2.o ,
in the maindir to make file say final.o file in maindir .
So the Makefile in maindir looks like:
obj-m := subdir1/ subdir2/
This will traverse the subdir1 & subdir2 and call their makefiles.
But how do i make final.o from subdir1/final1.o and subdir2/final2.o
Kindly help me with the solution.
Thanks in advance,
Regards,
Sapna
