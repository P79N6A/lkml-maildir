It really is. With subtle races, it can take a lot more than a few
hours. Consider that we have subtle races still in the kernel now,
which are almost never or rarely hit in maybe 10,000 hours * every
single person who has been using the current kernel for the past
year.
For a less theoretical example -- when I was writing the RCU radix
tree code, I tried to run directed stress tests on a 64 CPU Altix
machine (which found no bugs). Then I ran it on a dedicated test
harness that could actually do a lot more than the existing kernel
users are able to, and promptly found a couple more bugs (on a 2
CPU system).
But your primary defence against concurrency bugs _has_ to be
knowing the code and all its interactions.

Yes, reducing the number of users by going through their code and
showing that it is safe, is the right way to do this. Also, you
could avoid module insertion/removal?
FWIW, I think the idea of trying to turn Linux into giving hard
realtime guarantees is just insane. If that is what you want, you
would IMO be much better off to spend effort with something like
improving adeos and communicatoin/administration between Linux and
the hard-rt kernel.
But don't let me dissuade you from making these good improvements
to Linux as well :) Just that it isn't really going to be hard-rt
in general.
