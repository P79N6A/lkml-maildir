The user-mode port of 2.4.0-test10 is available.
The stack overflows seen in test9 are fixed.  The stack is now allocated as 
four pages, the top two used as a kernel stack, the third is inaccessible and 
acts as a guard page, and the lowest page contains the task structure.
Host devices can again be mounted inside the virtual machine.  This was broken 
a few releases ago when I made the block driver check io requests against the 
device size.
It will no longer crash if the main console is not a terminal.
I fixed a race which was causing strange kernel memory faults.
In the sources (the patch and cvs), but not the binaries, there is the 
beginning of a hostfs filesystem.  This gives you access to the host root 
filesystem.  Doing 'mount none /wherever -t hostfs' will mount the host root 
filesystem on /wherever.  Right now, you can mount it and cd into it, but ls 
will crash the kernel.
