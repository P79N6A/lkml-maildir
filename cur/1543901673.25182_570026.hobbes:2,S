No.

Exactly.

Well, the system uses about 30% of the cpu (cool'n'quite put it on the 
lowest frequency).
I made a plain 2.6.22.1 and could use it for about 2 hours without 
any problem. Then I applied the cfs-v19 for that kernel, rebuild from 
mrproper with the saved config and booted. After a few minutes the 
first app vanished... some more followed by time (I just surfed around 
a bit...)
The dmesg output is not differing in any interesting point (just some 
numbers, like raid-benchmark, some irqs or usb-numbers...)
So its obviously something within cfs... unfortunately...

Nothing is printed for a disapeared app for me.
Is there anything more I can try?
