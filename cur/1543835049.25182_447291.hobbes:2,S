Yeah.  It's super-hard to hit though - I spent some time trying to do so
back in 2.5.<late> and was unable to do so.
And nobody is likely to hit it in production because nobody will go and
write() into a pagecache page from a mmapped copy of the same page
(surely?).  So it's the deliberately-triggered deadlocks we need to be
concerned of here.
That's for ext2/3.  I didn't know about the reiserfs problem.

That would involve doing a follow_page() to get at the other pageframe.  If
we were to do that, we could just pin the page.  But we've always been
reluctant to add the cost of that.
I guess we could fix it by making the copy_to/from_user be atomic and if it
faults, drop the page lock, loop around and try again.
There's a more serious deadlock in there: an ab/ba deadlock between
journal_start() and lock_page().  It's hard to fix.
