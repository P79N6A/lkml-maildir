OK, I can confirm that these ones get washed out

I discovered that gcc-2.95.4 cannot compile kernel on sparc64 anymore :-(
I even wonder if it ever had been able to, because it does not know about
the -mmedlow option. I removed it to check further, but then ld segfaults
complaining that v8plus objects are not compatible with v9 output. Retrying
with 3.3.5 so...

I bet you guessed it gets ignored too :-) But I could test this on my
dual-athlon with gcc-2.95 if it is of any interest.
