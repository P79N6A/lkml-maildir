Oh, sorry. I actually had it produce a link-time error at first. But I 
wanted so much to make it fail at compile time that I screwed it up and 
didn't test both cases.
However, what you have in RT-V0.7.47-13 is still not correct. Now it 
again produces only a warning :-)
Patch attached. This time I really tested it in both cases. For struct 
semaphore it fails at link-time. For struct compat_semaphore it compiles 
without problems.
