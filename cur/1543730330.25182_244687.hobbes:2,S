I don't think so. Generally the error code is 0 for all normal GP cases. 
The error code tends to be non-zero only for the "load segment" things, 
when it shows what the incorrect segment was.
So I bet you'll see a zero error code and that checking for it won't 
actually cut down _that_ much on the double GP faults.
