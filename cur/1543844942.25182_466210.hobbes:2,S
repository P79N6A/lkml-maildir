I've only found MegaCLI which has the kind of interface that makes
me wish I was a bricklayer (I'm looking at the SAS raid card btw).
Pick your card out from 
http://www.lsilogic.com/cm/DownloadSearch.do
and you should get something. No source (fooey) but at least it's
something.
Wish the source was available though. I might be bothered to do
something about the interface.
