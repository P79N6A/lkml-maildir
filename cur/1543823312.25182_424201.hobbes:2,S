Blarg.  Now it won't do it.  Checking back, it looks like I managed to
get the ownership/permissions trashed while I was debugging the
modpost.c bug - looks like a 'make modules_install' rebuilt some stuff
as root it shouldn't have, so the next build as non-root was unable to
write some file and that scrogged the build...
Chalk this one up as collateral damage while debugging a real bug. :)
