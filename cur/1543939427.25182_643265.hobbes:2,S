As a tester, I'm not so happy.
The last few merge windows were a nightmare for us (the tester).
It remember me the 2.1.x times, but with few differences:
- more changes, so bugs are unnoticed/ignored in the first weeks or
- or people are pushing more patches possible, so they delay
   bug corrections to later times (after merge windows).
If it continues so, I should stop testing the kernel on the
merge windows (but it seems that other testers already give up
the early merge phase).
As a tester I would like:
- slow merges, so that developer could rebase and test
   (compile test) the interaction of the new code.
- you will introduce a new step on git management:
   Every changeset is compile-tested before going out to the world.
   I think this can be done automatically, and I think that one or
   two configurations are enough to find most of the problems.
Happy LCA,
ciao
