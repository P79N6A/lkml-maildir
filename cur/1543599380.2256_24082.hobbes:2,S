Hi,

Maybe - but at least I can't thing of any situation where that could be
needed.
> Having SUID muck with group IDs is pretty ugly.
It doesn't. It "mucks" with the group field in the file mode, it doesn't
do anything to the group id.
To be more exact: It copies the permissions from the user field in the
file mode to the group field in the file mode. Imo that is not far away
from the meaning of a SUID bit on programms: It gives the rights from the
user who owns the file to a wider range of users ..
yours,
