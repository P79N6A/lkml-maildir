12 + 1024 + 1024^2 + 1024^3 = 1.074.791.436 -> 4^12 max filesize.
So you think it doesn't worth to have a quad level of indirection to be
allowed to create a filesystem with 1k of blocksize and to be still able
to play with files >16giga, right? Having such level of indirection won't
change the size of the metadata we'll have on disk, but it will allow it
to be more finegrined on the disk side, saving some good bit of space. But
maybe if you have a so big fs you don't care losing a mean of some kbyte
per inode, and probably is better to decrease the complexity of the fs,
right?
