Greetings,
Per $subject, echo jiffies > current_clocksource pretty thoroughly kills
my P4 box, and does so with every kernel I have (2.6.22->present).  I
can drive the box via mouse clicks and poke around, but trying to select
another clocksource thereafter is nogo.. cat current_clocksource emits
jiffies, and box remains comatose unless prodded.
config attached
