Subject: NFSv3 client: Port to linux-2.3.21 is now finished....

Please pick up the patches against stock Linux 2.3.21 at
	
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/linux-2.3.21-nfsv3-0.3.dif.gz
Please note (as usual) that in order to mount NFSv3 partitions on your
machine, you will need a patched version of the standard 'mount'
utility. A patch against stock 'mount-2.9' is available at
	
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/nfsv3-mount
There are also ready-compiled RPMs for RedHat 6.0 and RedHat 6.1 style
distributions in the same directory.
Please note that the linux-2.3.x version of the NFSv3 patches contains
several new features: In particular I have adapted David Miller's
dircache updates, his symlink update and the SunRPC UDP copy+checksum
patch.
These features should hopefully be bug-free despite my tampering, but
one never knows. Luckily this is an experimental kernel and nobody
will trust sensitive data to it 8-)...
Cheers,
  Trond
