Ok, you mean active error-recovery on reading. My basic point is the writing
case. A simple handling of write-errors from the drivers level and a retry to
write on a different location could help a lot I guess.

Just to give some numbers: from 25 disk I bought during last half year 16 have
gone dead within the first month. This is ridiculous. Of course they are all
returned and guarantee-replaced, but it gets on ones nerves to continously
replace disks, the rate could be lowered if one could use them at least 4
months (or upto a deadline number of bad blocks mapped by the fs - still
guarantee but fewer replacement cycles).

I sure have contribution to it.
