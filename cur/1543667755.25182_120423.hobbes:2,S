Ok, in finding out a bit more of what the EEPROM driver is trying to do,
it looks like it qualifies for the "binary file in sysfs" exception.
It's just exporting a binary blob of data that exists in hardware
through the kernel to userspace, for userspace to do with it what it
wants to.
I'll work on converting the driver to that interface later tonight,
unless someone beats me to it :)

I think the "one binary file" will work for all of your varied systems,
right?
