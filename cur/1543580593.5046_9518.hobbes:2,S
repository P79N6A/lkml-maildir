That would require the vfs interfaces themselves (address space
readpage/writepage ops) to take kiobufs as arguments, instead of struct
page *  . That's not the case right now, is it ?
A filter filesystem would be layered over XFS to take this example.
So right now a filter filesystem only sees the struct page * and passes
this along. Any completion event stacking has to be applied with reference
to this.

One reason that I saw is that if the results of an i/o are no longer
required due to some condition (e.g. aio cancellation situations, or if the
process that issued the i/o gets killed), then this avoids the unnecessary
disk i/o, if the request hadn't been scheduled as yet.
Too remote a requirement ? If the capability/support doesn't exist at the
driver level I guess its difficult.
