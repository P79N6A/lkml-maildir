I don't think so. I found it in patch-2.6.0-test9-rmk1. In particular
arch/arm/common/rtctime.c and include/asm-arm/rtc.h which implement the
generic RTC bit. drivers/char/sa1100-rtc.c and
linux/arch/arm/mach-integrator/time.c have been ported to use it.
It looks very useful, and it would be pretty easy to make an i2c RTC use
it as well.
Ian.
