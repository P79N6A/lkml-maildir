I'm going to cautiously disagree. If the CPU needed was scaled so it 
represented a fixed number of cycles (operations, work units) then the 
effect of faster CPU would be shown. And the total power of all attached 
CPUs should be taken into account, using HT or SMP does have an effect 
of feel.
Disk tests should be at a fixed rate, not all you can do. That's NOT 
realistic.
