After upgrading from 2.2.0 to 2.2.6, it seems that packets that arrive
on an interface using the same address as another previously-existing
interface get discarded.
For example, using the Surfboard 1000 driver
(
http://www.jacksonville.net/~fventuri/sb1000-1.1.2.tar.gz
),
and connecting to MediaOne, my cable provider, results in ppp0 & cm0
interfaces:
ppp0      Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol  
          inet addr:24.129.30.142  P-t-P:24.129.43.75  Mask:255.255.255.255
          UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:39 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:2103 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          Collisions:0 
cm0       Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:00:30:B7:03:37  
          inet addr:24.129.30.142  P-t-P:24.129.43.75  Mask:255.255.255.255
          UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP  MTU:0  Metric:1
          RX packets:2020 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          Collisions:0 
          Interrupt:11 Base address:0x1e0 
This seems to work without any problems in 2.2.0; packets go out
through the ppp0 interface, and packets come in through the cm0
interface (except when the cable modem overheats!).
However, in 2.2.6, I see the cm0 RX packet count increasing in sync
with pings that I send out, yet none of those packets are seen by ping
itself.  I can also see the raw packets arriving via tcpdump of the
cm0 interface.
How do I correct this problem?  What is it caused by?
Any help would be appreciated!
Thanks,
