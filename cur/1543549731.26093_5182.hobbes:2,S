With max_queued_signals=4096, I can still only create 1022 threads under
perl-5.005-threads.  
With more than 1023 threads the process no longer responds to ctrl-c, or a
kill -INT on it.  A kill -9 will kill it however with no kernel lockup.
Under 1023 threads the process responds to ctrl-c.
It seems like the bug is definately involved in signal handling, and that
max_queued_signals affects it in some way...
My ulimit -a from bash... you can see open files at 1024, but I'm not
doing open files stuff in my test program (threadcrash.pl).
core file size (blocks)     0
data seg size (kbytes)      unlimited
file size (blocks)          unlimited
max locked memory (kbytes)  unlimited
max memory size (kbytes)    unlimited
open files                  1024
pipe size (512 bytes)       8
stack size (kbytes)         8192
cpu time (seconds)          unlimited
max user processes          4093
virtual memory (kbytes)     unlimited
I upped my open-files to 2048 and still was unable to get more than 1022
threads running.  I wonder if perl-5.005-threads might have a static limit
set somewhere inside it.  Maybe I'll try to recompile it tonight and see
what happens.
