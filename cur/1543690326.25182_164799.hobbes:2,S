oddball:root> modprobe aha152x aha152x=0x340,9,7,1,1,1
SCSI subsystem initialized
aha152x: invalid module params io=0x340, irq=8,scsiid=7,reconnect=1,parity=1,sync=1,delay=1000,exttrans=0
FATAL: Error inserting aha152x 
(/lib/modules/2.6.0-test5-mm1/kernel/drivers/scsi/aha152x.ko): No such 
device
It happily looks at the "9" in the init string and says "irq=8" doesn't 
work. Works with the 2.4.18 kernel from RH7.3, so ??? The IRQ jumpers are 
soldered on the board.
Clearly if I had the option of using another board I would, that's not
going to happen for various reasons (administrative and technical).
