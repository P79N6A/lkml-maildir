Right.

It took /years/ until open relays weren't common anymore... and that is a
/simple/ measure, on by default in newer upstream packages, no admin
intervention required. DNS works badly, here in Chile a mayor ISP had a
totally broken setup for many years.

They have /very/ little to gain by that, and setting it up correctly is a
mayor hassle. It breaks people sending mail "from" the domain when they
aren't there (this is rather common for people on the road), and has no
real fix. I.e., it won't ever be done. Or it will be tried, some email from
Big Cheese doesn't go through, and it will be axed.

Many people have no (or very little) control over their DNS data. A spammer
can then just claim it comes from one of the millions of SPF-less domains
in the world (if they don't set up their own SPFied one...). Besides,
discussions on the spamassassin lists show that SPFied email is a rather
reliable indicator of spam as things stand today...

Won't happen.

Yep. But SPF breaks email, not just changes the standard. For no gain at all.

There is spam that really comes from gmail...
