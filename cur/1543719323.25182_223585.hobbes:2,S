yep; irqbalance approximates irq processing load by irq count, which seems
to be ok-ish so far.

One NIC? I've yet to see that ;)

yep; irqbalance does that

this is in direct conflict with 2; esp since cpus are idle very short times
all the time in busy scenarios (and non-busy scenarios are boring wrt irq
loadf ;)

irqbalanced in principle arch independent since the /proc interface is quite
generic..
