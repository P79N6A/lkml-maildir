Yes.

The only place you are wrong is in using the word "good" of page->index
at the end, and indeed I think your point is that it's not good.  It is
not good, it is stale, but that's okay because page->mapping has been
set to NULL, and page->index has no meaning without page->mapping.
You'll notice that __free_pages_ok() contains many BUG() hurdles
(including check on page->mapping and redundant check on PageSwapCache)
but doesn't mind if page->index is non-zero.
But thanks for making me look at this function, there
is a bug there and I'll post a patch for it right now...
