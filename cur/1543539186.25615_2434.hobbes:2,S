Because the purpose of a library function is (IMHO) to save the user
as much work as possible, and for this reason I want to explore the
possibilities to make this self-contained.
I agree that passing a buffer is not too bad a solution too,
preferably with suitable definitions on buffer types in the header (I
still want to integrate IPv6 addresses).
