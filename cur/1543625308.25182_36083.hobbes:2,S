   Hey Dave, are you suggesting that no such exploits exist in Red Hat's 
   rpm system?  In order for that to be true, rpm would have to be making
   sure that each and every directory along any path that it writes is
   not writable except by priviledged users.  I just checked, it doesn't.
We should be using mktemp() to make temporary files, and if we don't
that is a bug and I'd ask you to please submit a bugzilla entry about
it if so because that would be a serious hole.
