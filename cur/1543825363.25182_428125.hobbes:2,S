Subject: [PATCH] More bloat-o-meter tweaks.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Some of the busybox users got confused by what looked like a table but didn't
have the total displayed at the bottom (where it won't scroll off it lots of
stuff changed).  Also, changes to string lengths weren't registering because
nm doesn't look at the rodata segment.  So I improvised.
This may not be the world's cleanest approach to addressing either issue. 
Feel free to improve upon it.  (And yes, it's svn output so it's -p0 instead
of -p1.  Sorry 'bout that.  Need to beat subversion with a large stick one of
these days.)
But what do you think of the approach?

Never bet against the cheap plastic solution.
