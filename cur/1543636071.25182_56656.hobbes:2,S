Hi,
These changesets contain some minor changes that are needed by the LSM
(lsm.immunix.org) patch, before we start to merge in the LSM patch
itself.  They move some structures out of a .c file and put them into a
.h file so other portions of the kernel can reference them.
Please pull from:  bk://lsm.bkbits.net/linus-2.5
These patches were created by Stephen Smalley <sds@tislabs.com> from the
main LSM tree.
If anyone has any questions about these changes, please let us know.
thanks,
greg k-h

  LSM: move struct shmid_kernel out of ipc/shm.c to include/linux/shm.h
  
  Also move where we set sma->sem_perm.mode and .key to before ipc_addid() gets called.

  LSM: move the struct msg_msg and struct msg_queue definitions out of the msg.c file to the msg.h file
  
  Also move where the msg->q_perm.mode and .key values get set to before 
  ipc_addid() gets called to make placing a hook there easier.
