Sorry for the late reply. Anyway, I think that's a known problem (at least 
to me ;). I have a much updated version of hisax here (no more cli()'s),
but it's not quite ready for submission to Linus yet. So it'd be nice if 
you have just a little more patience, I'm working on it, but it'll take 
quite a bit to completely stabilize ISDN again.
