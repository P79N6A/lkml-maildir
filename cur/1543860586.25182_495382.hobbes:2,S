We have some extensive code in fs/openpromfs/inode.c that
determines whether a property is text or not.  I can't
guarentee it works %100, but it's very context dependant
(only the driver "knows") but it works for all the cases
I've tried.
I really think you're making a mountain out of a mole hill, to be
honest :-)
