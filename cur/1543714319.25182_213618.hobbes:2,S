I have two HP DL360G3's running a very identical load on Gentoo, both
go into doorstop-emulation mode on 2.6.5-mm1 and higher -mm-kernels
withing 24 of running with very low load. I use hardware RAID, and
ha've SCSI, but otherwise its ServerWorks chipsets and ext3.
I've only caught them a few times in seeing the actual oops; at other
times it's happened with a blanked console, but the few I've seen have
been dying while handling an interrupt, and also, the tg3-driver have
figured prominently in the stack trace. 
If anyone have have a good idea on how to capture an oops that
instantly freezes the machine, then I'll go through and capture it
again; but for now I'm down on 2.6.3-mm3 and running solidly.
mvh,
