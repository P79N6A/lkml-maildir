I agree there's not much breakage, but it's a difference in handling things.
People who wrote libraries that generically find mappable memory of a UIO
device need to change their handling.

Well, UIO already rapes the mmap interface by using the "offset" parameter to
pass in the number of the mapping.
But I'll NAK the current concept, too. It's a UIO kernel driver's task to tell
userspace which memory a device has to offer. The UIO core prevents userspace
as much as possible from mapping anything different. And it should stay that
way.
