Very useful!  I'd like to see a short note on this in Documentation/
networking..Or perhaps if there is already a RAS best practices
kind of doc or something, add to that? (sorry, havent checked)
But it would be handy for people who wanted to contribute
patches for other drivers.
Essentially, things like some guidelines on classifying some
of those messages, when creating new messages. eg when is
something a state change and when is it a performance event?
I notice some slight ambiguity in your defs..(sorry, very
minor nitpick :)).
I'd certainly like to see messages from the driver when the
card enters/leaves promiscuous mode, as an example of things
we'd like to add...
thanks,
Nivedita
