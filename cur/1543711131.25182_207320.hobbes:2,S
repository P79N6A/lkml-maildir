Can you expand on this?  Does this mean that the admin can select different
idle-loop algorithms?  If so, what alternative algorithms exist?
On x86 I'd like to be able to turn idle=poll on when performing oprofile
run, so the numbers come out right.  Will this let me do that?

Yes, but the *meanings* of the different values of that sysctl need to be
defined, and documented.  If lowpower_idle=42 has a totally different
meaning on different architectures then that's unfortunate but
understandable.  But we should at least enumerate the different values and
try to get different architectures to honour `42' in the same way.

Needs to be initialised - atomic_t's may have spinlocks inside them or
anything else.

Needs to be in a header, not in .c

You cannot treat an int* as an atomic_t*!
Why do we want to inc and dec a user-specified tunable anyway?  I think I
don't understand what you're trying to do with this patch.
