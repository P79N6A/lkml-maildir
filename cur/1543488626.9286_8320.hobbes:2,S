Sure it is fair. You could use overlays instead, but most people
are too lazy to do it. Overlays can give you better performance.
Let's get rid of paging. It is slower than overlays!

I'd say a 24-hour or longer kernel compile is much performance loss.

Nobody claimed it was. MPI is not the only solution...

It can. It does not always. One might as well try, especially when
there is existing code that can be used.

Not all of them do. Some spend all their time waiting for messages.
