It's a small gain on a few machines. Where I thought it was more likely
to be a win is on x86-64 NUMA machines particularly if the zonelist
ordering was zone order as there would be potentially many nodes to
skip.
Kernbench didn't show up any regressions for the other machines but the
userspace portion of that workload is unlikely to notice the loss of a
cache line.
