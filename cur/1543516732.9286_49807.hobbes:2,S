Hi,
  there must be something wrong with my machine. I reported couple of
problems last week and now I got nastiest one (only short contents,
I had to write it down to paper; don't ask me to write it from paper
to mail client :-( ):
CPU 1
EIP 0010:C01111AC (smp_apic_timer_interrupt+252)
EFLAGS 00000002
EAX    00000001  EBX  00000001  ...
ESI    ...
DS     0018 ...
Process rc5des
Stack       5ead19e7  b80e06dc  1  c01c08c1 ...
Call trace  c01c08c1 <call_apic_timer_interrupt>  c01c002b <IRQ0x18_interrupt>
C01111AC corresponds with line 891 in arch/i386/kernel/smp.c:
smp.c:891  irq_enter(cpu, 0);  =>
include/linux/irq.h:59    hardirq_enter(cpu);
include/linux/irq.h:60    while (test_bit(0,&global_irq_lock)) { 
                             /* it was catched here! */
                          }          
smp.c:892  update_one_process(p, 1, user, system, cpu);
Registers suggests that global_irq_lock really contains 1 (eax), and 
that cpu number is correctly set to 1 (ebx).
Any ideas? I'll upgrade to something newer again, as I did before,
but it really looks to me like that I have some problem somewhere.
I even build kernel (not this) with slab redzones, poison and duplicate 
free debugging and switched all slabs to use this, but I did not catch
anything (but it worked stable for few days, so maybe...)
Machine was doing debian 'apt-get dselect-upgrade' (ftp-ing data).
I do not know, what other CPU was currently doing...
  Machine is dual PIII/450, 256MB RAM, 18GB UDMA33 EIDE, i440BX chipset,
2.3.29-pre1, SMP, no-HIGHMEM (of course there was NOT applied patches to 
speedup spin_unlock()).
                                    Thanks,
                                            Petr Vandrovec
