Ah, just found this original thread, now Cornelia's patches make more
sense...

Wait, that's the issue right there.
Don't do that.
devices should be created by busses or the platform core, which owns the
release function for them.  Individual drivers should not create
devices.
Hm, but then, how would you ever unload a bus, as the same issue might
be there too...
Any specific code in the kernel you can point to that has this issue
today?
thanks,
