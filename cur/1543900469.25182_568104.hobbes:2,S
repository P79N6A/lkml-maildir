One thing I'll happily talk about is that while 2.6.21 was painful, you 
and Thomas in particular were both very responsible about the thing, so 
no, I'm not at all complaining or worried about it in that sense!
I just really _really_ wish we could have two fairly stable releases in a 
row. I think 2.6.22 has the potential to be a pretty good setup, and I'd 
really like to avoid having another 2.6.21 immediately afterwards.
So I'm not worried about integration and getting fixes when things break 
per se, but I *am* worried that this is an area where we've traditionally 
had lots of unexpected problems.
And hey, maybe this time there will be none. I just still smart from the 
last time, so I'd prefer it to go more smoothly this time around.
