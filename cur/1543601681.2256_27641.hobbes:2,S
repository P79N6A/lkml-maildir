I've always wondered why it's not possible to do this:
fd = open("an_actual_file",O_RDONLY);
fcntl(fd,F_SETFL,O_NONBLOCK);
r = read(fd,buf,4096);
And actually have read return -1 and errno == EWOULDBLOCK/EAGAIN if the
block requested is not already cached.
Wouldn't this be the ideal interface for daemons of all types that want
to stay single-threaded and still offer useful performance when the
working set doesn't fit in cache?  It works with sockets, so why not
with files?
I see even TUX has to have I/O worker threads to work around this
limitation, which seems a bit silly.
