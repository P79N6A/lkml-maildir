Primarily its to keep 2.4 bits in sync, but at the same time
I'm going to try and keep it in a usable state for experimenting.
Carrying forward merges is no fun if I can't reboot the testboxes
for eg..
I'll also merge things expected to go to Marcelo/Linus to cut down on
merge time between Marcelo & Linus' patches.
When Linus is ready, the accumlated 2.4 bits will take priority
over anything else that happens to get picked up along the way.
regards,
Dave.
