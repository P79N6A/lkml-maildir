True in a "code centric" point of view. I do not think it is very usable 
to move this switch in the board setup : The user will have to check if 
an option is appearing in the board menu while he select the Atmel LCD 
driver. He is supposed to have already selected the chip'n'board he is 
using.
Moreover, this option will not show its nose until the board that 
implements it is not included in depends.
(It is basically the same case with the option just above, with the very 
same arguments).

Ok, will move it to a board switch (MACH_AT91SAM9261EK for instance). 
This will grow as STN configuration will be implemented for boards.
