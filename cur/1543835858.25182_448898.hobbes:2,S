It was a perfectly good example why 'do {} while (0)' is useful. The
perhaps mistakenly forgotten ';' after MACRO will not stop your example
from compiling if KILLER == 1. Even worse, it will compile and do
something totally unexpected.
If however you use KILLER != 1, the while(0) will require a ';' and this
example will fail to compile.
Not compiling when you made a coding error (forgetting ';' is one of the
most common) is a great help.
