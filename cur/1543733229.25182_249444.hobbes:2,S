I think someone else (tm) is looking at it :)
Some of the IBM hotplug guys I think.

The scheduler *should* be able to be fixed nicely by using cpu_online_map
everywhere, and basically undoing then redoing the domains setup before and
after the hoplug, respectively.
So you'd re-attach the dummy domain to all CPUs, do the hotplug operation,
then setup the domains again and re-attach them.
This whole sequence could be pretty expensive, but I don't think the hotplug
guys care. It would allow us to get rid of cpus_and(... cpu_online_map) 
from a
lot of places in the scheduler too, which would be nice.
The actual code to do it shouldn't be more than a few lines (but I could be
overlooking something).
