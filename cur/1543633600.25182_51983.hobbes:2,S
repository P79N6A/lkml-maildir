No, the CPU was correct.
However, now I am uncertain as to WHAT was wrong with my configuration since 
the CPU was correct.  Like I stated before, eventually I just hacked a stock 
RedHat kernel and in the CPU section of the configuration, I just left their 
selections alone.  Well, if what you say is true, then I don't know WHAT the 
fixed actually was, but I haven't had a bad reboot on any of my kernel 
compiles since then (well, I did have 1 - but that's out of about 20 
compile's and reboot's i've done since then).  If you find out the problem, 
please put it on the LKML so i'll know what fixed it.
