This seems to happen on my system too but I have and IDE tape:
Apr  3 00:00:48 www kernel: ide-tape: hdb <-> ht0: Seagate STT8000A rev 5.02
Apr  3 00:00:48 www kernel: ide-tape: hdb <-> ht0: 600KBps, 14*26kB buffer, 5850kB pipeline, 80ms tDSC, DMA
I have managed to recover the tar archive by writing the data through a
faucet pipe on another machine.
So this seems to be a problem only when I write the data on the same IDE
interface.
