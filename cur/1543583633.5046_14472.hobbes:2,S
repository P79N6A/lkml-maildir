Ehh.. If the merging doesn't actually happen, it's always a loss. We've
just spent CPU cycles on doing something useless. And in my tests, that
was the case a lot more than not.
Also, in the expense of taking a page fault, looking one or two levels
deeper in the AVL tree is pretty much not noticeable. 
Show me numbers for real applications, and I might care. I saw barely
measurable speedups (and more importantly to me - real simplification) by
removing it.
Don't bother arguing with "it might.."
