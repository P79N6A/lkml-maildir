I mean this:
		while (!( /* FIXME: now we are rather fault tolerant than nice */
		mirror_bh[i] = kmalloc (sizeof (struct buffer_head), GFP_KERNEL)
		) )
I've seen in the 2.4.0-test9-pre6 raid1 code the above is gone (and this looks
very promising :)), it is at least proof that some care about the deadlock is
been taken) and you instead sleep on a waitqueue now. While it's not obvious at
all that sleeping on the waitqueue is not deadlock prone (for example getblk
sleeps on a waitqueue bit it's deadlock prone too), at least it's not an
infinite loop anymore and that's still better.
Is it safe to sleep on the waitqueue in the kmalloc fail path in raid1?
