Quite correct. A test for the opcode and an error if it's "wrong" would
be the safest approach. Usually these types of command types are there
to kick the controller's state machine in the correct direction. So it
probably doesn't care what the command is (CMD12 happens to be the only
valid command for this transition ATM). Only those who know the
hardware's internal workings can answer this. So we either get in touch
with one of these people or we create a test case to determine this.

Yes. The hardware should be an interface to the MMC/SD bus. No more.
Anything else will eventually create a maintenance nightmare.

I do not think we should cater to the laziness of hardware manufacturers
(even if we happen to work for said manufacturer). The hardware has no
business caring about the opcodes, only their semantics. If the spec.
keeps referring to specific opcodes then we have to try and see past
those through guessing and testing. I am convinced that the hardware has
no requirements on the SD spec on a protocol layer. Only the
specification suffers from such a limitation. Let's try and overcome
that limitation in the driver.
What it boils down to is that layers and abstractions are there for a
reason. Let's try and not to break them because of short gains since it
usually ends up costing us in the long run.
