It's enough to fix the ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN problem. But it does _not_ fix the
ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN problem. s390 currently only uses ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN
since that should be good enough and it doesn't disable as much debugging
as ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN does.
What exactly isn't clear from the description of the first patch? Or why do
you consider it bogus?
