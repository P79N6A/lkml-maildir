Yes, and thinking about breakfast (it's 8:30am here).

man mdadm
       --backup-file=
              This  is  needed  when  --grow is used to increase the number of
              raid-devices in a RAID5 if there  are no  spare  devices  avail-
              able.   See  the section below on RAID_DEVICE CHANGES.  The file
              should be stored on a separate device, not  on  the  raid  array
              being reshaped.
So e.g.
   mdadm --grow /dev/md3 --raid-disk=7 --backup-file=/root/md3-backup
mdadm will copy the first few stripes to /root/md3-backup and start
the reshape.  Once it gets past the critical section, mdadm will
remove the file.
If your system crashed during the critical section, then you wont be
able to assemble the array without providing the backup file:
e.g.
  mdadm --assemble /dev/md3 --backup-file=/root/md3-backup /dev/sd[a-g]
