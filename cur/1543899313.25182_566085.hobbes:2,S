At least all the rest of the code will be untouched and you will not have
to reboot the machine. If you reboot to another kernel, nothing ensures
that you will have the same code sequences (in fact, gcc will reorder
some parts of code such as loops just because of an additional 'if').
So you know that the non-debug code you run will remain untouched. *This*
is important, because the debug code is not there to debug itself, but
to debug the rest.

it largely depends on the application. Applications which require a lot
of system calls will be more sensible to kernel debugging. Common sense
also implies that such applications will be the ones for which kernel
debugging will be relevant.

It is not for the CPU performance they can be disabled, but for the code
size which is a real problem on embedded system. While you often have
mem/cpu_mhz ratios around 1GB/1GHz on servers and desktops, you more often
have ratios like 16MB/500MHz which is 1:32 of the former. That's why you
optimize for size at the expense of speed on such systems.
