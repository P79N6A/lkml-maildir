I have two planned changes that will be done RSN:
- On x86/x86-64, user-space uses the mmap()ed state's TSC start
  value as a way to detect if a user-space sampling operation
  (which needs to be "virtually atomic") was preempted by the kernel.
  On ppc{32,64} we've used the TB for the same thing up to now,
  but that doesn't quite work because the TB is about a magnitude
  or two too slow. So the plan is to change ppc to store a
  software generation counter in the mmap()ed state, and change
  the ppc user-space to check that one instead.
- Move <asm-$arch/perfctr.h> common stuff to <asm-generic/perfctr.h>.
In addition, there is one unresolved issue:
- A counter's value is represented by a 64-bit software sum,
  a 32-bit start value containing the HW counter's value at the
  start of the current time slice, and the current HW counter's value
  (now). The actual value is computed as sum + (now - start).
  This is reflected in the mmap()ed state, which contains a variable-
  length { u32 map; u32 start; u64 sum; } pmc[] array.
  This layout is very cache-efficient on current 32 and 64-bit CPUs,
  but there is a _possible_ concern that it won't do on 10+ GHz CPUs.
  So the question is, should we change it to use 64-bit start values
  already now (and take more cache misses), or should that wait a few
  years until it becomes a necessity (causing ABI change issues)?
