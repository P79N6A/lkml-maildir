Subject: Problem with 8250_pnp Module and using ttyS0 as console

Linux version... at least as far back as 2.6.19 and upto and including 
the latest
one I've tested, 2.6.25.
When the kernel has been configured to use ttyS0 as the console port, via
modification of the boot command line, 'console=ttyS0,115200', the kernel
ultimately traps with an exception, if the module "8250_pnp.ko" is loaded.
Removing this module eliminates the fault.
Is this a problem or a documented incompatibility?
John Clark.
