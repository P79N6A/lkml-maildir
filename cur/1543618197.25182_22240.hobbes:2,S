What statement? The block layer gives you the allignment that _you_
need. Heck, all you have to do is make a simple api call and define your
rules. Nobody is trying to cram anything down your throat. 255 is just
the kernel default, nothing more.

False, I've enforced current_nr_sectors transfers in multi-sector write.
But Andre please understand that changes like this are never final, feel
free to alter it and make it work any other way. Fact is, we needed a
change that made pio and multi mode _work_ right now -- my change does
that, and it's not all that bad.

Well I'm sorry for making changes to your isr's, but they were broken.

?! I can't do anything but block stuff now, what a pity. Please tell me
where the block layer is dictating what you must do.

I can add a
	BUG_ON(rq->nr_sectors == 255);
for you if you want, that will not happen.

What is broken?

Oh like the partial completion I added in ide_end_request?
Please calm down Andre, lets not start another round of flames.
