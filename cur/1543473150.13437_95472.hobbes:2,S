You missed the basic problem:
	CPU#1			CPU#2
	start_bh_atomic()	start_bh_atomic()
	access bh count		access bh count
	end_bh_atomic()		end_bh_atomic()
You can have both processes do the access in parallel with your patch #2.
Your first patch was ok - even if they do the bh disable in parallel, at
least the bh count is sane because it's updated with an atomic read. The
bh masks are another problem, and that should be considered a separate
problem. 
Your second patch is bad: it only fixes the specific race in the console
driver, where the other CPU is in a bh context. If the other CPU is _not_
in a bh context, then "start_bh_atomic()" doesn't do anything at all for
you. 
A "start_bh_atomic()" does NOT imply any actual critical region locking. 
It only means that a bottom half will not run (as the name implies). Two
CPU's can be in different bh-atomic regions at the same time, it _only_
protects against other software interrupt handlers running concurrently.
