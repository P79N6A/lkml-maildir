kref abstraction is good.
Its current implementation seems straightforward, so I understand some devs 
think they can 'just use an atomic_t' themselves.
But using kref is better because some generic improvement could be done at 
kref level and you dont need to parse all kernel sources to change atomic_t to 
kref...
Example of improvement in kref_put() :
[PATCH] kref : Avoid an atomic operation in kref_put() when the last reference 
is dropped. On most platforms, atomic_read() is a plan read of the counter and 
involves no atomic at all.
