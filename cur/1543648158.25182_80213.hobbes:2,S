Heh, so are there any other devices besides the qlogic device that
support this?

I think those comments are a great start, fix all of them, and I'd be
glad to look at the code again.

Hm, sounds like the IPMI driver needs to be generating /sbin/hotplug
events itself.  That way everything could be done in userspace, right?

Could the IPMI core do that itself?

I don't know a thing about IPMI.  Feel free to ask questions here, or on
the linux-hotplug-devel list if you want to.

In the 2.4 kernel tree take a look at:
	drivers/hotplug/pci_hotplug_core.c
and there's an article at:
	
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=5633
on how some of that stuff works.
In the 2.5 kernel, things are much easier, with the libfs code.  Take a
look at:
	drivers/hotplug/pci_hotplug_core.c
	drivers/usb/core/inode.c
	fs/driverfs/inode.c
for 3 different implementations of ramfs based file systems.
Hope this helps,
