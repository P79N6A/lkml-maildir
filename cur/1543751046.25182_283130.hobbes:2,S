Andrew,
Dave Hansen and I have reordered the memory hotplug patchset so that the page 
migration patches occur first.  This allows us to create a standalone page
migration patchset (on top of which the rest of the memory hotplug patches
apply).  A snapshot of these patches is available at:
http://sr71.net/patches/2.6.10/2.6.10-mm1-mhp-test7/
A number of us are interested in using the page migration patchset by itself:
(1)  Myself, for a manual page migration project I am working on.  (This
      is for migrating jobs from one set of nodes to another under batch
      scheduler control).
(2)  Marcello, for his memory defragmentation work.
(3)  Of course, the memory hotplug project itself.
(there are probably other "users" that I have not enumerated here).
Unfortunately, none of these "users" of the page migration patchset are ready
to be merged into -mm yet.
The question at the moment is, "Would you be interesting in merging the
page migration patchset now, or should we wait until one or more of (1) to
(3) above is also ready for merging?"
(Historically, lkml has waited for a user of new functionality before merging
that functionality, so I expect that to be your answer;  in that case, please
consider this note to be an preliminary notice that we will be submitting
such patches for merging in the next month or so.  :-) )
