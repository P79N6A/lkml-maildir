I don't have your version of source here at the moment. If it was
2.4.1, you just comment out line 321 of ../linux/arch/i386/kernel/i8259.c
and re-compile, re-install. That gets rid of the message.
FYI, unless you get a burst of these things, they are harmless.
Cheers,

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
