That's my point - it usually crashes everywhere else.

The problem is that it's not regression tested and quite complex and tends
to break often and stay broken.
If you don't want to mark it CONFIG_BROKEN then i would suggest a panic
early when the system isn't SUMMIT (I think NUMAQ does this already)
Something like the appended patch
-Andi
i386: Panic the system early when a NUMA kernel doesn't run on IBM NUMA
It has been broken forever anywhere else and is not too useful
anyways so best to disable it.
