No, I agree.  I don't think pending delayed work should contribute to the
count at all.
If someone wants to synchronise with the workqueue system they should cancel
any delayed work which they own (via cancel_scheduled_work) and then wait on
any currently-queued works via flush_scheduled_work().
So flush_scheduled_work() only needs to care about currently-queued works,
not the ones which are pending a timer event.
And flush_scheduled_work() needs to be taught to not lock up if someone keeps
re-adding work.
That's what my patch did (I think; it was a quicky)
