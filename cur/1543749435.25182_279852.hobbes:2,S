Well, that's ok (but maybe give it a better name, e.g. 
CONFIG_PAGE_VIRTUAL_PTR?)

Why do you want to put these into separate headers? These would be AFAICT 
good candidates to pull into a single header. Via linux/gfp.h they are 
all pulled into a lot of files, so it doesn't make sense to split them 
because they may have different users.

Why do you want to separate constants and structures?
There only relatively few users of mmzone.h, so fixing them is easy and 
the main problem with mmzone.h are the macros in asm/mmzone.h, which 
should be pulled into a different header and the few remaining definitions 
could be also merged with other definitions (is there really a good 
reason for a separate asm/numnodes.h or linux/numa.h?).

You may be surprised. :)
Play around with "mkdir test; echo 'obj-y = test.o' > test/Makefile; echo 
'#include <linux/foo.h>' > test/test.c; make test/test.i 
CFLAGS_test.o=--trace-includes".

Well, I don't really like lots of mini header files. I think it's more 
important to collect related information and only strictly separate 
between definitions and users, when a header gets to large we can still 
split it.
