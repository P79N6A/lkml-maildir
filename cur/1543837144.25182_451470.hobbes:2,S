Yes bytes_out is in the .bss for both files.

Even worse, from the time the .bss is cleared to the time gunzip() is
called inside decompress_kernel(), there is very little code to do some
stomping.  
So I am stuck trying to debug this.  This code seems very fragile.  The
more debug code I add (ie putstr) the more the length is off (varies from
-32 to +1).  Makes me scratch my head as to what is really going on here.  
I created a really pathetic patch to get the thing to boot but even that
doesn't make sense.

And yes, the 'dummy' variable needs to be there.  
I am trying to use gdb on vmlinux to fish for clues.  But I am at a loss
right now.
