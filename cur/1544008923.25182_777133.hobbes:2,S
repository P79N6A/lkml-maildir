On boot up, the CPU 0 idle task is attached to init_struct_pid, and not 
the others. If you do a "attach_pid" on the next idle task that is created, 
it will become the attched process, bumping off CPU 0's idle task from the 
init_struct_pid.
When doing the code you suggested, I end up with only marking the last 
idle task to be created.
