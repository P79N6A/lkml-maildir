Subject: [PATCH] docbook: fix escaping of kernel-doc
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

hoi :)
the following patch fixes a bug I introduced with the last patches
of the DocBook generation.
Signed-off-by: Martin Waitz <tali@admingilde.org>

Please apply.
... and I really have to redo my bitkeeper repository as it
is full of merge artifacts as BK did not note the fact that
the patches were applied using normal patches.
I guess I have to use one complete tree per patch and recreate
the public repo as a combination of the individual ones.
Alternatives?
