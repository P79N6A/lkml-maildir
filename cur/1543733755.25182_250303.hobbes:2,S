That document was wrong on some things, misleading on others; this
fixes some of the issues I noticed.
However it probably needs to say that drivers for devices that implement
the PCI PM spec "should" always use pci_set_power_state() to reduce the
power usage.  If I get ambitions I might submit a patch to the PCI core
to print a nag message for drivers that don't do that.
- Dave
Updates the PCI PM docs, better matching the specs and code.
  - List both D3 states (D3hot, D3cold) up front.
  - Clarify that suspend() methods should disable I/0 (including DMA)
    and IRQs; it's not optional.
  - More accurately describe resume(); there are common cases where
    device re-initialization isn't appropriate.  The previous text said
    re-init was always required; that's false.
