This "cure" sucks worse than the disease.  Now you're putting it onto
everyone who maintains userspace to do the same repetitive task of
"sanitizing" this.  Especially for things this trivial, this is a
ridiculous concept.
For 2.7, getting real exportable ABI headers is so bloody necessary
it's not even funny.  However, for 2.5, breaking things randomly is
not the way to go.
