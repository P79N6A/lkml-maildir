Why?  I just got rid of a function (well macro) that isn't even needed
(as proven by replacing it with an existing function.)  That's
technically a good thing :)
Now I can agree that some of those replacements could be done with a
different function call, as almost none of the replacements in the
driver/* tree really want to walk all of the pci devices in the tree.
They usually just want to walk all devices of a type of pci device (be
it capability, or other trait.)  I'd be glad to take changes of this
sort in the future.
thanks,
