If there's only one "init" style task running from initramfs, which simply 
looks at the partitions and gets the info it needs from disk labels or 
something without actually mounting a filesystem (or mounts it read only, no 
journal playback, and then unmounts it again afterwards...)  And then the 
system call/whatever it does is sematically "exit and resume from swap"...
There might have to be some way to plug the hotplug event queue, though.  I 
don't know enough about what's involved in the interaction between hotplug 
and suspend...

Okay.  Tell me how to get hotplug devices (cardbus, usb) working 
monolithically, and I'm all for it.
They mostly work now.  I've currently got these loaded:
orinoco_cs 7432 1 - Live 0xcc072000
orinoco 37508 1 orinoco_cs, Live 0xcc07f000
hermes 7936 2 orinoco_cs,orinoco, Live 0xcc06f000
ds 11264 5 orinoco_cs, Live 0xcc06b000
yenta_socket 14080 1 - Live 0xcc050000
pcmcia_core 58624 3 orinoco_cs,ds,yenta_socket, Live 0xcc05b000
