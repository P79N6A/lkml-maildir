Let's look at why the correction is done in first place. The update steps 
don't add up precisely to 1sec (LATCH*HZ != CLOCK_TICK_RATE), so a small 
addjustment is used to make up for it. The problem here is that if the 
update frequency changes, the addjustment isn't correct anymore.
The simple fix is to just omit the addjustment in these cases in ntp.c:
#if NTP_INTERVAL_FREQ == HZ
...
#else
#define CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST	0
#endif
bye, Roman
