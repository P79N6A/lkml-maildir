Hi all!
I have running a 2.2.12 kernel without any problems on several machines
(RedHat-6.0) When I try to boot a 2.3.18(and all other 2.3.7-2.3.17) 
kernel I get a message Kernel panic: No init found. Try passing init=
option to kernel. There is a working init at /sbin/init with:
file /sbin/init:
/sbin/init: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1, dynamically
linked (uses shared libs), stripped
ldd /sbin/init:
  libutil.so.1 => /lib/libutil.so.1 (0x40018000)
  libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x4001b000)
  /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)
Does anyone know a workaround to that problem. Another problem is, that I
cannot build my aic7xx driver as a module as I did in 2.2.12. 
Uwe
