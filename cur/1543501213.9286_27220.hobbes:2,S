Curt Schimmel: Unix Systems for modern architectures.
It is expensive, but it has really a great discussion about spinlocks
and SMP issues so it is worth the money (and actually it partways just 
looks like a tutorial on how to SMPize the Linux kernel, although the word 
Linux is never mentioned ;)
With the number of locks I wouldn't try to hard to fine grain it, often
less is more (if you have too many locks you add much inter CPU cacheline
traffic). If you have only one IRQ probably a single subsystem lock is
enough because it serializes anwyays (?), but actually only real world 
profiling can tell you for sure.
