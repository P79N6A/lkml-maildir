Ok. As I said I had such a process few days ago, but I had to boot because
XFree dpms locked up. So far enlightenment has gone into unkillable state
twice with this kernel (2.2.13pre17), so there is a good change it does it
again. Don't hold your breath, though -- it has usually taken week or two.
I'll try to post anything I can dig out as soon as such process appears
again.
