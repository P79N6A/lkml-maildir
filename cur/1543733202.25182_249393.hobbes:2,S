Once you have the common structure the rest of the problems go away
rather nicely over time.

It doesn't solve the problem. That is the fundamental part of it. I can
put the code in the same place or in different places, the problem you
have to fix is co-ordination, and when you fix that not suprisingly you
still don't care where the code lives.
Create a top level video device object to hold dri and fb info pointers.
End of problem #1. Make that top level video object the one which is
handling the pci device irrespective of DRI/fb loading first. You've now
solved the load order problem. Make DRI tell fb about display layout in
X and provide sync functions. You've now solved the Oops problem.
After that you can begin to worry about dual head and memory management
which is a *lot* harder than you seem to realise and much of which
cannot be done user space side for performance reasons.
