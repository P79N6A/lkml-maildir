   You should certainly see it in "uname -a" output, for example.
   
Doesn't tell you the kernel pointer size.  We fake the uname
output when a process runs as PERS_LINUX_32BIT which is what
we use to trick 'configure' and other build programs in order to
build 32-bit apps properly.
   Compile oprofile for the proper architecture if you do it yourself, and
   complain to the vendor if the vendor is stupid enough to supply a 32-bit 
   oprofile with a 64-bit kernel.
   
   There is _no_ excuse to bloat the kernel for user mistakes.
   
There simply is no fully usable 64-bit userland on some of these
platforms.
