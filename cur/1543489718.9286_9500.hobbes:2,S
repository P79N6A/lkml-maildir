I think you haven't worked on an SGIs enough. We've seen many
applications crash the machine. We've got one at DD currently. A gamma
application, when you set the gamma to 0, your Onyx will crash. I
suspect SGI gets away with it, because no one has tried writing random
data to their boards. :-)

Yes, if the person installing the device didn't read the README, they
could be worse off. I would hope that root installing a new device would
be at least as careful as installing a program setuid. The README warned
the user that you could crash the box with the device and to restrict
access appropriately. That's why I would never want it in the standard
kernel, as it would be too easy to just throw it in without
understanding the issues.
