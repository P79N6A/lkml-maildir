This is still ridiculously slow.  From cold cache (i.e. with a lot of IO)
cp -rl linux-2.6 foo1 gives 1.2s here.  That's at least about 50000
operations.  On slower CPU, BTW, with half of the RAM you have.
Moreover,
al@duke:~/linux$ time mv foo1 foo2
real    0m0.002s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.001s
Now, try _that_ on your setup.  If you are using entire pathname as key,
you are FUBAR - updating key in 20-odd thousand of records is going to
_hurt_.  If you are splitting the pathname into components, you've just
reproduced fs directory structure and had shown that your fs layout
is too fscking slow.  Not to mention the fun with symlink implementation,
or handling mountpoints.
You are at least an order of magnitude off by performance (more, actually)
and I still don't see any reason for what you are trying to do.
