Kernel: 2.0.35
Speed: 16 Mb
Test environment:  10 WINNT clients "SMB/IP" doing continuous reads of
	volumes mounted on a Linux server. Tested independently with
        Olicom 3137 and IBM Lanstreamer Token-Ring drivers. 
After about 4 hours of running under repeatable heavy traffic
conditions all clients timeout and attempt to reconnect to no avail.  Both
Linux servers fail to respond to pings after the timeouts.  However,
broadcast Transmits are still being received from the Linux box. 
I think it may be possible that something in the Token-Ring specific part
of IP which may have a memory leak.  I have also osnoticed what appears
to be a page leak when I ping large packets in excess of 4K.  
I am currently enabling debugs in the paging code in the linux
kernel as well as adding debugs to files in  /net/core and net/802.  Has
anyone else experienced similiar problems with Token-Ring or even EtherNet
for that matter ?
tcp restart always recovers from the situation.
