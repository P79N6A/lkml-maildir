Hi.
I have linux-2.2.4pre and wanted to update to 2.2.10.
I got it from sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de.
I configured it (quiete normal).
I made it... and everything seems to be o.k.
I rebooted and there it says something LIKE the following:
Checking Partition: driver not loaded or not existent or not available...
hda: VFS failure
kernel-panik: cannot mount root partition
And the kernel-booting stops.
WHAT's wrong?
What information do you (perhaps) need - my kernel-configure-file?, or the
EXACT kernel-text from the booting.
???
Bye,
K.Posern
