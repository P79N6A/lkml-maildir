Sure, "unbiased" all right...

Do that on NFS over a shared Ethernet and have people hate you.
The SMB filesystem (not our implementation) can support that operation
on the server, saving network bandwidth and preserving security data.
The above has little to do with multi-forked files though. One may
use directory-like structure as the internal representation of a
multi-forked file, but multi-forked files are still seen as files.

You don't break files down into files. You break files down into
subfile components that share file attributes. This is like threads.
(note that Linux threads are not POSIX because they are too process-like)

FreeBSD people maintain Linux emulation code. As soon as they copy us,
every commercial vendor will be able to add support. The existance of
two implementations would be good.

According to Unix98, you may not rely on that. If /newdir is on the
same filesystem, the OS _must_ move directories. If the OS supports
cross-filesystem hard links, the OS _must_ move directories. Your
command can only fail when it crosses a mount point on an OS that
does not support cross-filesystem hard links.

Nope. You can 'cat' and 'cp' all you want. The worst that can happen
is that you end up with a less-efficient non-forked representation of
the file.

For perhaps the first time, I agree with Ulrich Drepper. The LD_PRELOAD
hack is simply unacceptable for normal use. Don't touch libc.

Performance is a good reason. Would you mind if Linux was losing office
suite benchmarks by a factor of 1000 or more?

Well, we agree on something.

Do you realize why HFS support is ugly? We don't support forked files!
HFS is not at all ugly on an OS with proper support, such as MacOS.

Icon data belongs in the executable. Executables could be normal ELF
binaries or multi-forked files -- it does not matter. If a user doesn't
like the icon... well, we don't let users change the code either.
Users that override the code must change $PATH, and users that override
the icon can do the same sort of thing. No problem.

You have a 1.5 GB compound document.
It contains 3 evenly sized parts.
You want to extend the middle part by one byte.
ps: let's just wait until we know exactly what Samba and Wine need
