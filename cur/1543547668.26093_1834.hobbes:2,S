My point was basically that omitting useful debugging tools makes it not
any less likely that people use the (A) strategy (easy fix instead of real
understanding).   For some people it is so painfull to work with raw dumps
that they want to get out of that pain as quickly as possible, like with
just adding an if (!ptr) return; and be done with it.
