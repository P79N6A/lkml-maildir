There are other gotcha's here as well (speaking from experience :-(

Or much worse, let the kernel mix-and-match SSE and MMX optimized routines
without doing full saves of the FPU on SSE routines, which leads to FPU saves
in MMX routines with kernel data in the SSE registers, which then shows up
when the app touches those SSE registers and you get use space corruption.  My
code to handle this type of situation was *very* complex, and I don't think I
ever got it quite perfectly right without simply imposing a rule that the
kernel could never use both SSE and MMX instructions on the same CPU.

Now this I can comment on.  Real life gain.  We had to re-run a SpecWEB99 test
after taking the SSE instructions out of our (buggy) 2.2.14-5.0 kernel that
shipped in Red Hat Linux 6.2 (hanging bag over my head).  We recompiled the
exact same kernel without the SSE stuff, then re-ran the SpecWEB99 test, and
there was an performance drop of roughly 2% overall from the change.  So, yes,
they make an aggregate performance difference to the typical running of the
kernel (and this was without copy_page or zero_page being optimized, instead I
had done memset, memcpy, copy_*_user as optimized routines) and they make a
huge difference to benchmarks that target the areas they help the most (like
disk I/O benchmarks which would sometimes see a 40% or more boost in
performance).
