More often than not, when a post doesn't get any responses it's a good sign: 
it means nobody disagrees.  It can of course also mean that nobody read it, 
but that's not very likely on this list, especially if you put [RFC] in the 
subject line.

To increase the chance of getting comments, cc people who might be 
interested, particularly subsystem maintainers.  For this one, cc'ing fsdevel 
would be a good idea too.  It's a low volume list, but the traffic on it does 
get read by many people with a clue.  If you want to be really sure of 
getting feedback, cc Linus or Al Viro.
Personally, it sounds like support for shortcuts as symlinks is a natural and 
needed improvement, though I haven't looked at the the internal details.  
(Shortcuts arrived in Microsoft-land at about the time I lost interest.)  I'm 
kind of surprised the support isn't already there.  Perhaps you could briefy 
describe how shortcuts work on vfat?
