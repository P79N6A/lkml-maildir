I don't think we'd want to generate events for those, except perhaps if
they exceed certain thresholds.

True; it's a work-in-progress, and was actually sent just as I was
boarding a plane. I shall attempt to go back through the messages I've
received and address anything else that's pending.
If you can summarise the bits I've missed in the meantime that would be 
wonderfully useful -- especially if you could do so in 'diff -u' form :)

Absolutely. I don't want to do the conversion -- I want to present the
raw data. I was just a question of whether I provide 'capacity' and
'units' properties, or whether I provide 'capacity_mWh' and
'capacity_mAh' properties (only one of which, presumably, would be
available for any given battery). Likewise for the rates, thresholds,
etc.

Ok. Committed to git://git.infradead.org/battery-2.6.git
