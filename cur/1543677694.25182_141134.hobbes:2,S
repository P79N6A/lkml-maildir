Subject: gcc-3.2.2 miscompiles kernel 2.4.* O_DIRECT code ?

Hi,
I found out that O_DIRECT does not work correctly on 2.4 kernels
compiled with the RH gcc-3.2.2-5 on RH9.  It is working fine with
kernels compiled with the RH gcc-2.96-113 on RH 7.3.
The sympton is that read() only returns zeroes (as data).  No errors.
It happens with several 2.4 kernels I have tried, including 2.4.21-ac1.
I don't know if this is a RH9 gcc specific bug or if it is a generic
gcc3 problem. That's why I post here: to find out if more people
have seen this.
I also filed a bug in RH's bugzilla.  See this for more details:
