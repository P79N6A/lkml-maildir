The default priorities and not RT.
ps -eo pid,pri,rtprio,cmd
...
  6  34    -  [events/0]
  7  34    -  [events/1]
...
I can set those as well but then I'd probably have to follow with
the X server and everything else in the chain. The starvation problem
ripples across the system.
Will try the patch shortly and get back on the results later today.
