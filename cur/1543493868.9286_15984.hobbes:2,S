How about just allowing mounting the device twice. (This would be nice for
a variety of reasons actually, not just audiofs)
Then the user can put anything they want anywhere they want.
mount -t iso9660 /dev/hdc /mnt/cdrom0
mount -t audiofs /dev/hdc /mnt/audio
Or
mount -t iso9660 /dev/hdc /mnt/cdrom0
mount -t audiofs /dev/hdc /mnt/cdrom0/audio
Well VCDs and XA discs do something like this (yes, vcdfs is fictional)
mount -t iso9660 /dev/hdc /mnt/cdrom0
mount -t vcdfs /dev/hdc /mnt/cdrom0/mpegav
