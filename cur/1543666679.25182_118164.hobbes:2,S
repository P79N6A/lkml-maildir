Actually, I agree, but the only way out that I see is to
add yet another macro, which replaces the second SET_PERSONALITY
on 2.5 and adds a hook for 2.4 in that place.
Current 2.5 code looks bizzare:
    for (headers) {
        if (is header) {
            interpreter = x;
            SET_PERSONALITY(elf_ex, ibcs2_interpreter);
            break;
        }
    }
    if (interpreter) {
    } else {
        SET_PERSONALITY(elf_ex, ibcs2_interpreter);
    }
    flush_old_exec();
    some_more_core
    SET_PERSONALITY(elf_ex, ibcs2_interpreter);	// Cries for extermination!
    current->mm->free_area_cache = TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE;
Spaghetti wihout goto's!! There's no way to get to the third
SET_PERSONALITY without being there once, so what does that mean?
