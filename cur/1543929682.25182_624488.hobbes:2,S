... I corrected my math in the second email. [1] 
Never the less, a VOIP network (E.g. G729 and friends) can generate the
maximum number of frames allowed on 10GbE Ethernet which is, AFAIR just
below 15M -per- port. (~29M on a dual port card)
While I doubt that any non-NPU based NIC can handle such a load, on
mixed networks we're already seeing well-above 1M frames per port.
