That gives us some possibilities for 2.7:
 o undelete
 Ext2 has undelete support, but that information is overwritten on unlink by
 ext3, so  ext3 won't work with the undelete utilities.  How do the other 
 filesystems fare in this regard?
 o per file compression
 Ext2/3 has a flag for it, but support hasn't been implemented.
 o per file encryption (can use a user space helper for policy)
 Reiser4 plans to have a plugin that will support this.
 What about the others?
 o make hole support
And my personal favorite:
 o pagecache coherent defrag (on live filesystems)
Andrew Morton wrote a patch for this a while back but since there were no
userspace utilities, and it was ext3 specific, it wasn't merged, and nothing
AFAIK has happened with it since.
