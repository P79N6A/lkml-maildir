If the compiler always aligned all functions and data on 16 byte
boundries (NetWare) 
for all i386 code, it would run a lot faster.  Cache line alignment
could be an option in the loader .... after all, it's hte loader that
locates data in memory.  If Linux were PE based, relocation logic would
be a snap with this model (like NT).
