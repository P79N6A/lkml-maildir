	 In case anyone is interested, the conflicting lock of
init_mm.page_table_lock was acquired in line 1318 of mm/memory.c,
in pte_alloc.
	One way that this might be happening is that it looks like
no page_table_lock is every acquired by vmalloc, which results in
the following call graph:
	vmalloc
	__vmalloc
	vmalloc_area_pages
	alloc_area_pmd
	pte_alloc ...which assumes (here incorrectly) that
		mm->page_table_lock is held, and sometimes releases
		and reacquires mm->page_table_lock.
	I will attempt to analyze this further tomorrow if nobody
beats me to it.
