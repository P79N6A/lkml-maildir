Impossible?  I think not.  Some "mechanical" devices do exhibit true 
random capability, especially when enhanced by algorithmic means.
To wit:  
http://www.lavarand.org/
Let me know if you can prove their methods don't provide a true "high 
quality" random source.
I'd like to see their code as a module with an automatic test to make 
sure that the random source is high quality.  In this case, that would 
mean making sure that the cap was not off the camera.
