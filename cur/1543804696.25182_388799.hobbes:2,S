Except there are really no small fish :)
This solves the one really ugly part of my current patch,
that I had simply not thought through.
There is already something similar for paths in the fs
namespace.
char * d_path(struct dentry *dentry, struct vfsmount *vfsmnt,
				char *buf, int buflen);
Which does exactly this.
Now frequently it is passed in a page sized buffer so
it's not quite the same but close enough.
