I'm counting on Ian to provide the memory management code. I haven't
even looked at it very much. The point is simply that we have to have
something, you just can't support multiple heads without minimal
memory management and fbdev doesn't currently have any memory
management. Since the plan is for a mode setting command to take a
path unto user space via hotplug it may be possible for all memory
management code to exist in user space. The basic point is that the
memory management code must be unified.
