ACPI on my VAIO was a bit jerky until I disabled local APIC. It now seems to
work OK. BTW, this notebook would never reboot with local APIC ON ! The BIOS
cannot access the hard disk anymore.
Even if they're not the same systems, perhaps you should try to disable APIC
on your thinkpad ?
Cheers,
Willy
