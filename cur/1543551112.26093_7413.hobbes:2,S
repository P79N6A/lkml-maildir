Yes:
What kind of timeout errors are you seeing? Kernel debug logs would be
helpful.
What devices are you trying to use?
What is your .config file?
What is your BIOS setting for MPS (if it's 1.4, please try 1.1)?
There are quite a few broken USB drivers in 2.4.0-test9.  See the
linux-usb-devel mailing list for the patches, or I can send them to you
if you want.
I'm successfully running USB on a smp machine for both 2.4.0-test9 (with
extra USB patches) and 2.2.18pre15 with no problems.
thanks,
