I posted some information on the fedora-list concerning my experience
with this problem. I am using a Tyan S2885/dual 244 Opterons. For HW and
driver details see:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-list/2005-May/msg01690.html
I have been using Dave's FC3 test kernel (2.6.11-1.24_FC3smp) for a
little over a day and have been unable to generate the problem with the
computer under a larger than normal load.
Prior to May 12, I had been seeing the problem very regularly. It
started around April 14. I believe this is about the time I first
started using the 2.6.11-1.14_FC3smp kernel. I remember I had to get a
BIOS upgrade from Tyan (
http://www.tyan.com/support/html/b_s2885.html
unfortunately a Beta release) to get my network back once I started
using the new kernel. After that the memory.c messages started showing
up. I though it might be BIOS related (see the note on the referenced
Tyan page), but when I saw Christopher's post I thought maybe it was the
kernel because his MOBO doesn't have a Beta BIOS release. I googled and
found this thread, and subscribed to this list.
I have "memory.c:97 bad pmd" entries in my /var/log/messages files going
back to April 14. The only days I don't have them are April 20, 22, 23,
24 and April 29 (22, 23, and 24 are a weekend with less activity). I
have had them every day in May until I installed Dave's test kernel.
I am very computer literate, but not a kernel developer. I hope I didn't
offend you guys by posting here. I would be willing to be your guinea
pig for testing. Currently I am unable to reproduce the problem. If I am
able to reproduce the problem, would you prefer I post here or on the
fedora list?
Thanks for all of your efforts,
Pete
