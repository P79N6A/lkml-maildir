I don't think the modularity was referring to had anything to do with
multiple developers.  I expect that he had several independent modules,
which could/should execute in parallel, and each of which had some amount
of state.  By using multiple threads, it is frequently possible to
implicitly keep track of this state in a thread's stack.
To switch to an event-based model, that implicit state would have to be
explitly saved and restored when processing other events.  Depending on
the application, that state could be arbitrarily complex, and
saving/restoring it could be hard to do quickly and correctly.  Once
you've written all the save/restore code, you've essentially written your
own special-purpose user-level threading library, and each 'event' is
really just a 'context switch'.
