Hi,
I want to change the TCP ( for a given specific application with lots of
modifications to the basic TCP) implementation in Linux and integrate it with
the linux kernal. Since TCP comes as apart of Linux kernal and also TCP and IP
implementations in Linux are tightly coupled, please suggest how to go about
integrating TCP (which is developed for a specific application with lots of
modifications) into Linux kernal. Kindly give as much details as possible.  
regards,
Pallab.
