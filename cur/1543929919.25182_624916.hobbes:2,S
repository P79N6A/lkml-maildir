I have'nt looked at it yet. I do appreciate it, I think it might 
broaden the user-base of this feature which is up to now s390 only due 
to the fact that the flash memory extensions have not been implemented 
(yet?). And it enables testing xip on other platforms. The patch is on 
my must-read list.

Oh I know, the author's office is aproximately 500 meters away from 
mine, next building. I have'nt heared of anyone actually using that 
one lately.
