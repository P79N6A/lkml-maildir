Yeap, this did the trick.  I'm working on SRST/init stuff and I think I 
can post patches later today.  What workload do you use for testing a 
ATAPI device?  I'm currently thinking of the following...
* mounting & tarr'ing cdrom & unmount
* repeat above with eject/load
* burning a cdrom
* ripping a music cd with cdparanoia
Any other thing I can try?
