thinkpad-acpi will autoload by DMI ids in 2.6.23, which is a much better
solution for model-specific drivers like thinkpad-acpi than autoloading by
HID, IMHO.
Thus, I'd prefer if your patches did not make thinkpad-acpi autoload by HID.
I will send a first batch of thinkpad-acpi changes for 2.6.23 to the list
soon, which includes the dmi autoload aliases.
