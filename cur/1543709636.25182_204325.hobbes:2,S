it should in every SLES8 kernel out there too (it wasn't in mainline
until very recently), see the related bhs stuff.

I meant that making the kernel stack 4k pretty much requires removing
the task_struct, making it 4k w/o removing the task_struct sounds too
small.

not a definitive one, but it's sure more than 2m per cpu, could be 3m
per cpu.

which doesn't need to be mounted during production and hotplug should
mount read it and unmount. It's worthless to leave it mounted. Only
root-only hardware related stuff should be in sysfs, everything else
that has been abstracted at the kernel level (transparent to
applications) should remain in /proc. unmounting /proc hurts the
production systems, unmounting sysfs should not.

yes.

this is true for 4:4 too. Also with 2.4 the system will return -ENOMEM,
not like 2.6 that lockup the box. so it's not a fatal thing if a certain
kernel can't sustain a certain workload in a certain hardware, just like
it's not a fatal thing if your run out of memory for the pagetables on a
64bit architecture with 64bit kernel. My only object is to make it feasible
to run the most high end workloads in the most high end hardware with a
good safety margin, knowing if something goes wrong the worst that can
happen is that a syscall returns -ENOMEM. There will always be a
malicious workload able to fill the zone-normal, if you fork off a tons
of tasks, and you open a gazzillon of sockets and you flood all of them
at the same time to fill all receive windows you'll fill your cool 4G
zone-normal of 4:4 in half a second with a 10gigabit NIC.
