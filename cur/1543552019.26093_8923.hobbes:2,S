Well, according to /proc/pci there's two USB controllers:
  Bus  0, device   7, function  2:
    USB Controller: VIA Technologies VT 82C586 Apollo USB (rev 6).
      Medium devsel.  IRQ 10.  Master Capable.  Latency=32.
      I/O at 0xd400 [0xd401].
  Bus  0, device   7, function  3:
    USB Controller: VIA Technologies VT 82C586 Apollo USB (rev 6).
      Medium devsel.  IRQ 10.  Master Capable.  Latency=32.
      I/O at 0xd800 [0xd801].
