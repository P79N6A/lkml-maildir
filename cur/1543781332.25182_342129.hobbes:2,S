Just for the record, it was a KDE service daemon that caused these errors for 
me, like a 24MB log in 12 hours:
KDED Media Manager
Also trying to remember, I had a CD-RW on /dev/hdc and a CD-R on /dev/hdd.  It 
was /dev/hdd that give those errors, but I only passed the SCSI emulation on 
kernel line for the CD-RW.
So I suppose it uses similar code (of sorts) as HDPARM.  I dunno.
The old drive was 6 years old anyway - so after I sussed the issue I pretend I 
did an upgrade ;-)
