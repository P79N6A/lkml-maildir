Right.  And yes Linus tree was started from scratch.  He started with
2.4.0 and imported all prepatches.  The 2.5 tree was created as a
clone of the 2.4 tree at the appropriate place.
So Chris is right csets in Ted's tree won't directly apply to Linus'
tree.  Sorry.
I think 'bk export -tpatch' and 'bk import -tpatch' is called for.
You might find the new 'bk comments' command (new in 2.1.4) useful to
fixup the comments after 'bk import'.
If you have a large ammount of state to transfer, let me know and
maybe we can rig up something better.
