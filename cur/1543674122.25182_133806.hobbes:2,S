A looong time ago I gave to someone a recursive spinlock implementation
that they integrated in the USB code. I don't see it in the latest
kernels, so I have to guess that they found a better solution to do their
things. I'm biased to say that it must not be necessary to have the thing
if you structure your code correctly.
