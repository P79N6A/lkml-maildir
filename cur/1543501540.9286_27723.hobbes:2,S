I did.  The message on the screen as the machine boots indicates that the
primary master and primary slave drives are LBA UDMA drives.  One thing I
should mention is that whenever I try to set  multicount to something other
than 0 and then run hdparm -t /dev/hdb the system locks up completely.  There
is no way to switch to another virtual console and reboot.  I end up having to
use the infamous reset button.  Chip do you have any idea what's going on?  Is
there anybody on the linux-admin list that has a similar TYAN Trinity 100AT
board and using UDMA successfully under kernel 2.2.x?  If so I would like to
hear how you did it.   Chip where is that "Ispci" utility that you used to
generate the host bridge info of your board?  I believe I have a MVP3 AGP chip
set on this motherboard.  
Thanks.
