FYI: did you patch the rtc.c file (by hand), otherwise rtc_latency will not work
because it uses the async code from Paul Barton Davis,
and the rtc patch included in the latencytest tarball doesn't apply cleanly to
2.2.14. (But it is trivial to adapt it to 2.2.14)

In one case the kernel froze and kept spitting out "kmem_alloc" errors 
in an infinite loop.
