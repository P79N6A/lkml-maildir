What do you mean by "it's an option" and "is off by default".  I would
claim that any major linux distribution that I've seen in the last ten
years has support for module auto loading (enabled by default).
There are many userspace programs that try to autoload modules, such as
device-mapper, ipsec, etc.  
If you disable module autoloading, it's your own responsibility to load
modules manually.
So the only thing that I really consider a bug is that bogus error
message of iptables.  This has been fixed in SVN, case closed.
