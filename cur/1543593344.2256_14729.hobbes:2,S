The concept is general and useful, though I don't think its expression 
here is correct.  A similar feature used in dynix was described earlier 
in some detail by  Paul Cassella:

    (Re: [RFC] Semaphores used for daemon wakeup)
The idea is to atomically release one serializer and grab another.  We 
have quite a few flavors of lock so square that and you have the number 
of primitives you'd need for a complete set.
To sell the idea you'd have to come up with a few places where the new 
primitives would make the kernel run better, then you'd have to 
implement it or find someone with the necessary scheduler hacking 
skills to do it for you.  The last part is the tricky one. ;-)
