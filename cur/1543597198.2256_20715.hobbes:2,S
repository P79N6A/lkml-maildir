Depends how you parse it.  With uncompress-ing, the word "uncompress" is
actually a pronoun -- it is the name of the traditional uncompress
program.  Being a name, it does not have to be a real word. :-)
Now really, the kernel is not "compress"-ed per se, it's "zipped".
So may I suggest:
  Unzipping linux.... done <grin>
