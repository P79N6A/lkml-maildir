I'm thinking of a `what you really need to know to get a patch considered' web 
page.

I wonder if my epckpt author knew it?  Somehow I doubt it.
What we end up with is this: anyone who needs (as distinct from `wants', in a 
linux-kernel mailing list way) to add functionality to the kernel would like 
to add it to the stable kernel.
1) because they're doing something else that depends on the patch, and they 
don't need extra worries from the (presumed) instability of the development 
kernels.
2) because they'd like to be working with somewhat more stable versions of 
internal data structures (to the extent they need to dick with them.)
3) because their consumers are likely to be running a stable kernel, that's 
their target.
It's not at all immediately obvious to someone who wants to do something that, 
perforce, relies upon kernel mods, that the development kernel is the place to 
start looking.
Whether the requirement of patching the development kernel's a good or bad 
thing, I have no opinion.  I merely make the point that it's not clear to 
someone who's only *secondarily* interested in patching the kernel, and 
primarily interested in providing functionality which properly or necessarily 
belongs in the kernel.
This conversation's cleared it up for me.

I'll have a look.

I think I mean patches motivated by a desire to extend the kernel, or improve 
the kernel for its own sake, rather than patches intended to add functionality 
to userland for which kernel space mods is considered necessary.
I'm not speaking authoritatively in this, but it seems to me that e.g. GGI 
were aiming to solve a user problem, and were rejected because they offended 
some ethos in kernel-land.  The frustration and bitterness arose, I would say, 
because of a difference in the primacy of values.  GGI: We want this 
functionality, it must be in kernel space to work.  Kernal: it makes the 
kernel ugly and bloated, or vaporous, or not crispy enough, or whatever you 
guys use as the unit of niceness.
As someone who doesn't admire monolithic kernel `crispiness', I'm pretty well 
on the GGI guys' side, because the utility offered exceeds the (nominal) 
disutility of code which doesn't conform to a standard I don't value.
My point is: there's useful userland functionality going begging because the 
kernel group values it lower than some fad gadget tweak.  If the userland 
functionality makes a difference, that's a centrifugal force.

It's only a problem when they try to synch the mods back in, apparently, or 
when then claim they're doing their own QA and ask that it be valued.

I'll rephrase:  anything not primarily motivated by a desire to hack the 
kernel.

Sure.  It comes down to perceived cost/benefit, I guess.  All strength to 
Larry McVoy in his quest.  It'd be very useful.

Wouldn't matter if they had the right.  They don't have the ability.  Which's 
why I found the treatment of the ISDN people heavy handed, uncooperative, 
peremptory, arrogant, unconstructive.  (pick your adjective.)
