These block numbers read as "ate: Fri, 12 Jan 200" (i.e. part of an email
header) if you convert to 32-bit hex, then ascii.  There was another report
of corruption like this under 2.4.0 as well.

Actually, I thought there were problems in the test11? through test-13
kernels of this sort.  I'm not sure exactly when it started, but a search
of l-k should locate it.  Depending on when last you fsck'd your filesystem,
you may have already had some of these disk problems.  However, there was
another report recently on 2.4.0 that looked the same, and that user had
just e2fsck'd his filesystem before booting 2.4.0 for the first time after
running only 2.2, so it looks like a 2.4.0 bug.
Cheers, Andreas
