Due to the newly added command filtering, you now need to run cdrecord as
root. Since cdrecord will drop root privileges before accessing the drive,
setuid root won't help.
This means you will have to run cdrecord *and* k3b as root!
IMHO it is more secure to simply disable filtering, and run the software as non-root.
This patch restores the behaviour of previous kernels, security issues included:
