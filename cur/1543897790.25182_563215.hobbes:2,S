I tried this kernels:
2.6.20
2.6.20.1
2.6.21
2.6.21.1
2.6.21.3
2.6.21.5
2.6.21.5 with and without cfs. Every other kernel without cfs. Patched with 
reiser4, nvidia not loaded nor used. All of them locked up. I tried two 
different cdrtools 2.01.01_alpha27 and alpha25. No change.
The strange thing: 2.6.21.1 has worked in the past. At the 21.May I tried 
(successfully) to burn a dvd. The only real change I could find since then: I 
recompiled the whole system to remove 'ricer' cflags. 
Glück Auf
