The Dreamcast port hadn't been tested in some time, so a couple of bugs
fell out in recent testing. So, here are some last minute fixes to get
the Dreamcast working again.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lethal/sh-2.6.git sh/for-2.6.28
Which contains:
Matt Fleming (1):
      sh: maple: Do not pass SLAB_POISON to kmem_cache_create()
Paul Mundt (1):
      sh: Disable GENERIC_HARDIRQS_NO__DO_IRQ for unconverted platforms.
