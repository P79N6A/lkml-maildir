Yes. The memory should be allocated using GFP_KERNEL | GFP_DMA flags, but this
is probably a nop on at91 and avr32.
I prepare a patch using the generic dma api (allocation + dma mapping in one
call = simpler code).

If the memory at the end of the cacheline is used by the cpu, it will be
corrupted while you call dma_sync_single_for_cpu(..., DMA_FROM_DEVICE);
