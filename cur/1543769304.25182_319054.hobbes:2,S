I agree, that's why it has been rewritten in the -mm tree :)
Anyway, your patch doesn't take into account that device_attach()'s
return value is tested in the bus_rescan_devices_helper(), so if you
change the return value, that also needs to be changed.
But even in the -mm tree, the bus_add_devices() function has not had the
error handling added to it that you provided, is there any devices that
you are seeing that need this?
thanks,
