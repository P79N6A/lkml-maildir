There's this comment in the current code:
/*
 * If we have APM enabled or the CPU clock speed is variable
 * (CPU stops clock on HLT or slows clock to save power)
 * then the TSC timestamps may diverge by up to 1 jiffy from
 * 'real time' but nothing will break.
 * The most frequent case is that the CPU is "woken" from a halt
 * state by the timer interrupt itself, so we get 0 error. In the
 * rare cases where a driver would "wake" the CPU and request a
 * timestamp, the maximum error is < 1 jiffy. But timestamps are
 * still perfectly ordered.
 * Note that the TSC counter will be reset if APM suspends
 * to disk; this won't break the kernel, though, 'cuz we're
 * smart.  See arch/i386/kernel/apm.c.
 */
That sounds good, on the other hand I can't convince myself that it's
true. In do_fast_gettimeoffset we unconditionally use last_tsc_low
which is set only in timer_interrupt. So what happens if we wake up
and call do_gettimeofday before a time interrupt happens? Can't we
overshoot by seconds because last_tsc_low is wildly wrong? Basically,
I expected to see something in apm.c that sets last_tsc_low after
suspend, and I don't.
