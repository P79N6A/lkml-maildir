So, if we want to be clear, we should freeze sysctl interface and focus to
/proc/? And sysctl is expected to disappear from the kernel by the time? If
not, I admit that I wasn't very much sure if exactly [pid] should go there.  If
answer is not, fine, as specially /proc/[pid]/ should be parsed with no
problems with scanf() (expect "(procname)" in /proc/[pid]/stat ;), as a
difference to some nightmares in device specific proc files etc. _Those_ are
which I propose to mirror in sysctl tree. You still can put nice progress bars
here to help humans (which is great), and you won't make programmers run around
crying something about linux [developers] stupidity. And I don't see any
disadvantage in this - /proc/ should remain supported forever and nothing stops
you using it, and you won't fill it with .bloat files.. (and that actually was
what Linus told he won't accept, iirc)

Well, 'veto' was for binary **** in /proc/. This is something completely
different. And actually done ;).
