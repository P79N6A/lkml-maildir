Could you find some time to spare to review them?  You can grab them from:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/nfs/nfs
+fscache-14.tar.bz2
Trond wants them to be reviewed by Christoph before accepting them, but I
don't Christoph has the time.  So if I could get someone else to review them
instead, maybe that'd satisfy him.
