I managed to obtain some sources, I can't tell immediately how complete
they are, but they do seem to incorporate some BlueTooth stuff.  A 
tarball
is available at 
http://www.rovingnetworks.com/accesspoint.tgz
  Thanks to
Mike Conrad at RovingNetworks for providing the sources without much
hassle!
I believe that all of these are under GPL, but please confirm before you
assume so by looking through the sources yourself.
NOTE: Mike said that it is _very_ easy to completely bork your wireless
access point if you try to upgrade its kernel.  It _doesn't_ have a 
flash
ROM that can be removed for reprogramming, so BE CAREFUL.  I am
personally most interested in their BlueTooth stack and other non-2.0
stuff.  It might be useless to us, but there's probably somebody that
would find it handy.
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
