This might soon affect the majority of Linux users, so it's a case that

But if APIC is even used on my more than 1 year old 40 Euro Socket A 
board (AFAIK there have never been dual core Socket A processors, there 
were no Socket A hyperthreading CPUs, it's not an SMP board, and the
VIA KT600 is not an SMP chipset) it's not in what you call "safe group",
and I don't see any reason why my board should behave different in this 
respect from all of the millions of other UP Socket A boards.
Googling show that it could be that your claim "APIC on true UP (no 
Hyperthreading/Dualcore) is a thing no hardware vendor tests (Microsoft 
doesn't use it)" earlier in this thread was wrong. Looking at e.g. [1], 
it seems Windows does use the APIC even on UP.
