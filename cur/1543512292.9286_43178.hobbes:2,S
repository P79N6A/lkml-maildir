yes, all these cleanups would be very nice to have. I'm not aware of any
rathole in that area - even those small steps we took in early 2.3 proved
how much cleaner things could get.
The memory usage point on low memory machines - i dont think it holds.
Small directories (well, even larger ones ...) will use 4k, but since the
2.0 kernel moved to the page cache small files already used up 4k as well,
and there are more small files than small directories. In the case of
indirect pointers the 2.3 page cache only needs the indirect pointer once,
then it can be deallocated by the cache if there is memory pressure -
while 2.2 needed the indirect pointer for every write(). So i suspect 2.4
might even do better on small-memory boxes than 2.2.

nobody AFAIK.
