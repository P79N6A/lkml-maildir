The compiler couldn't know that there won't ever be a child class with two
(or more) virtual functions, so this optimization would be incorrect, or
at least silly.  Should that child class have two function pointers, or
a function pointer and a vtbl pointer?  It can't have just the one vtbl
to preserve compatibility with objects of its parent class.  What if the
child class (with two inline function pointers) had a child class which
added more virtual functions, what goes then?  Two pointers and a vtbl
pointer?  Where does it end?
Usually the right answer to "where does it end" is "it doesn't start".
