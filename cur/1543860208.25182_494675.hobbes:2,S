Yes, we can do that -- how about aio_restarted() as an alternate name ?

We don't have have the kiocb available to this routine. Using current->io_wait
avoids the need to pass the iocb down to deeper levels just for the sync vs
async checks, also allowing such routines to be shared by other code which
does not use iocbs (e.g. generic_file_sendfile->do_generic_file_read
->do_generic_mapping_read) without having to set up dummy iocbs.
Does that clarify ? We could abstract this away within a lock page wrapper,
but I don't know if that makes a difference.
