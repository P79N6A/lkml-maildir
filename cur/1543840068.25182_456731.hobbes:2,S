This overs P4 in 64-bit mode only!
What you have in i386 is the architectural perfmon support as documented
by Intel for Core Duo/Core Solo and possibly others. Core 2 is something
different but hopfully backward compatible with this.

Well, no. the PEBS record format is differnet between 32 and 64-bit mode.
In 64-bit they add r8-r15 in each sample. The rest of the logic is
exactly the same. Until now, I have kept the 32 and 64 bit format
completely separate. But I will merge them in my next patch to cut
down on the amount of code.

Every sampling format is identified by a UUID. This  is how an
application can identify the format it wants to use when it
creates a context.

As of now this file (perfmon_em64t_pebs_smpl.c) is only compiled in
64-bit mode. Once I merge with 32-bit I will force types to avoid
alignment problems.

It is in the patch I call modified x86_64 files.
Thanks for you quick and valuable feedback.
I will make the change you suggested on this part.
