This patch was exactly for per-user resource accounting.
In particular it accounts and imposes limits on the total amount of memory
mlock()ed by processes of a particular user.
As far as I can see it's safe with the patch to allow unprivileged users to
mlock() certain amount of memory with the proper limits configured.
