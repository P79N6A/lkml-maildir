I have an ext2 partition with over 5% fragmentation (as reported by
fsck). I don't know if that makes me _need_ a defrag tool, thogh...

I believe "people"(TM) would buy a NU for Linux, because "people" have 
already bought NU for NT which, in my experience, is just a collection 
of frontends, speed reducers and memory hogs. (NDD is essentially a
frontend for chkdsk, speedisk always seemed to make my disk even more
fragmented, no matter how many times I ran it, and the only thing
System Doctor ever did for me was to prove that NT isn't as stable as
one would wish it was  :)
Anyway, I don't believe this discussion is very "Linux-kernel"
related.
