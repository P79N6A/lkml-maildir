Presumably you mean that hw-breakpoint.c shouldn't do anything at all on
single-step exceptions.  do_debug does have to know about them, because it
has to know whether or not to send a SIGTRAP.  Separation of duties; I
tried to move too much out of do_debug.

Good enough.

It's easier simply to ignore the whole issue.  :-)  Fortunately many other 
architectures don't have to worry about it at all.

So far I've been developing under 2.6.21-rc, which doesn't have utrace.  
But eventually this will be submitted by way of -mm, which does.  The
easiest approach would be to make the whole thing conditional on 
CONFIG_UTRACE.

The actual guarantee I need is that nobody will switch_to() the task while
my routines are running.

Yes; I had in mind that the user-breakpoint part would be called only by 
utrace and/or ptrace.  That's why the routines aren't EXPORTed.  But I 
wrote it in more general form, to make it easier to understand.  I'll add 
some comments about this.

If someone really needs to do that, they can always put their own call to
(un)register_kernel_hwbkpt() at the entry(exit) to the complex subsystems.  
Or perhaps it should be a job for systemtap, which would use hwbkpt to do
the actual work.

That's the wrong test, but I get your point.

Not nearly as hot as switch_to()!  But I'll do it.

That may be so, but the only way to access that part of the state is via
ptrace.  Think of it this way: The debug register settings really should
not be part of the thread's virtual state.  If we had some other, more
logical API for managing breakpoints in a task then ptrace_bps[] wouldn't
be necessary at all (other than for backward compatibility perhaps).
> You shouldn't need a struct hwbpkt here really, just unsigned long vdr[4].
That would make things much more complicated.  It's a lot easier to treat 
all breakpoints as though they are the same under the hood.
Besides, the extra memory usage will show up only on threads that are 
being debugged, which means we can safely ignore it.

Another thing to watch out for is that we would have to allow length-8
breakpoints in 64-bit mode.  I'll add a few comments.

I get the picture.

True.  .priority can take on its default value of 0.

That doesn't seem quite right.  What if you encounter _both_ a single-step 
exception and a breakpoint at the same time?  Probably kprobes should 
always return NOTIFY_DONE.
Which implies that do_debug needs to decide whether or not to issue 
SIGTRAP.  Presumably the condition will be that any of the DR_STEP or 
DR_TRAPn bits remain set after the notifier chain has run.  This means the 
kprobes code will have to be modified to clear DR_STEP in args->err.

Easy enough.  I'll just move the code from one file to the other.

That's essentially what the patch does do.

Fair enough.
