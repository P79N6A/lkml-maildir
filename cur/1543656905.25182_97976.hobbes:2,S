It is already available.  I've announced it on the NPTL mailing list a
couple of days ago.  There is no support without NPTL since the TLS
setup isn't present in sufficient form in the LinuxThreads code which
has to work on stone-old kernels.  But the NPTL code is more than stable
enough to run on test systems.  In fact, I've a complete system running
using it.

It is not easy to build glibc and you can easily ruin your system.  You
need very recent tools, the CVS version of glibc and the NPTL add-on.
See for instance
https://listman.redhat.com/pipermail/phil-list/2002-December/000352.html
for a recipe on how to build glibc and how to run binaries using it
*without* replacing your system's libc.  There have been That's save but
still the build is demanding.  I know I'll be lynched again for saying
this, but it's the only experience I have: use RHL8 and get the very
latest tools (gcc, binutils) from rawhide.  Then you should be fine.
If there is interest in RPMs of the binaries I might _try_ to provide
some.  But this would mean replacing the system's libc.
