Hi!
There's quite real race in atkbd_command:
static int atkbd_command(struct atkbd *atkbd, unsigned char *param,
int command)
{
        int timeout = 500000; /* 500 msec */
        int send = (command >> 12) & 0xf;
        int receive = (command >> 8) & 0xf;
        int i;
        atkbd->cmdcnt = receive;
[user presses key here]
atkbd_interrupt eats user keypress, thinking its reply. Boom. To
exploit:
while true; do setleds +num; setleds -num; done
then try typing.
