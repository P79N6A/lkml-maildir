	... the machine hung twice at installation time when running mke2fs
	on this partition. The third time, mke2fs succeeded and I got through
	with the installation.
Hmm. If you see disk errors already at mkfs time, I wouldnt be
surprised at all also seeing disk errors when the fs is used.
Get another disk.
