Hmm. I'm actually somewhat puzzled by this also. Shouldn't things only
check for inequalities between the results of these and NR_CPUS? i.e.
things like:
	if (any_online_cpu(cpus) >= NR_CPUS)
and
	for (cpu = first_cpu(cpus); cpu < NR_CPUS; cpu = next_cpu(cpus))
etc.?
Maybe the few callers that are sensitive to the precise return value
should use min_t(int, NR_CPUS, ...) instead of all callers taking the
branch on behalf of those few.
