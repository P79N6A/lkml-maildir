Main thing to note is, while unmapping linear address space, we should not
free underlying pages, page table pages (for all hierarchies), till we flush
the active TLB caches in all the CPUs.
Violation of this can potentially cause SW failures and hard to debug issues
like

Linus and Christoph went in detail about this.
http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-kernel/2007/9/21/271638
There were some preemption and other concerns that Linus mentioned,
and was referring to of integrating quicklists and mmu_gather operations
and not keep them separate.

I have to look at i386 code but I don't think it was using quicklists
as extensively as the previous x86_64 code does. Will take a look at it.
