Subject: [PATCH 1/2] new valid_signal function
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/18/195

This patch adds a new function  valid_signal()  that tests if its argument 
is a valid signal number. 
The reasons for adding this new function are:
- some code currently testing _NSIG directly has off-by-one errors. Using 
this function instead avoids such errors.
- some code currently tests unsigned signal numbers for <0 which is 
pointless and generates warnings when building with gcc -W. Using this 
function instead avoids such warnings.
I considered various places to add this function but eventually settled on 
include/linux/signal.h as the most logical place for it. If there's some 
reason this is a bad choice then please let me know (hints as to a better 
location are then welcome of course).
A patch that converts most of the code that currently uses _NSIG directly 
to call this function instead is [PATCH 2/2] coming shortly..
