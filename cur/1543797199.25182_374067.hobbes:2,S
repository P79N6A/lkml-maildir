There is Xnest that allows X to run on X.
There are process groups and sessions that while they may
not strictly nest you don't loose the ability to create new
ones.
There is the CLONE_NEWNS and just about any of the other
clone flags in linux.
There is bochs that emulates the whole machine.
I am actually a little surprised that UML can't run UML.  I
suspect it is an address space conflict and not something fundamental.
With pidspaces as long as the parent isn't required to send
signals to arbitrary children  I don't think nesting pids spaces
is hard.  Or more properly have a process in one pidspace be
the parent of a process in another.  Although I grant there
are a few boundary issues, that have to be handled carefully.
