Thats the interesting part, I have 2 cards plugged in... 1 x SIS6326 AGP
graphics card, and 1 x Connexant PCI modem card.
If I put the modem card into the left most pci slot, I get a bios IRQ
routing error.
I've replaced the AGP card with another make, same problem, I've had my 
supplier replace the motherboard, same problem. Replaced the CPU, same
problem.
I'm going to take the system back to the supplier tomorrow and ask him
to sort it out.... I'm not going to tell him anything apart from "It
does not work", its useless explaining to him the above if he not going
to understand a word of it.
Could this be an incompatibility issue between the CPU and the mobo?
Regards
Nigel
