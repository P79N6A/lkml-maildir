Umm...  As for getting all capabilities, I was planning to do the following:
modify suid check to give you everything except the mask taken from vfsmount.
So that's no problem - this is exactly the place I would modify.

Now, _that_ may be more serious.  However...

*blam*
Congratulations with potential crapload of security holes - now anyone
who'd compromised a process running as nobody can chmod the damn thing
and modify it.
And that is the reason why suid-nonroot is bad.  It creates a class of
binaries that can easily give you a root compromise if one of them has
an exploit - even if that one is never run by root.  That is the reason
why such things are done with sgid-nonroot and not with suid.  Member of
group can't chmod.  Owner can.  And yes, you can take away chmod - but
you need to do that for everything that will run with that UID.  Which
might be impossible - some might need chmod(2).
FWIW,
$ ls -l /usr/sbin/sendmail
-rwxr-sr-x    1 root     smmsp      617672 Oct  2 13:33 /usr/sbin/sendmail
- no suid at all.  And making it suid-nobody would decrease security.
Note that _all_ binaries that need any capabilities now are written to
be suid-root.  So the only case left from your scenario is
	* new binary
	* runs with UID of caller
	* wants some capabilities
	* doesn't want to be portable (it won't work on any other Unix,
since we had assumed that it doesn't want to be suid-root and still
relies on caps present)
	* doesn't use any of $BIGNUM portable mechanisms (separate
helpers, descriptor-passing, yadda, yadda).
Umm...  Do we really want to help these out?  We don't even have an
excuse of that being an important 3rd-party program brought from some
other system - it will be Linux-only and new, at that.
Now, _removal_ of capabilities on exec makes a whole lot of sense -
suid or not.  So IMO correct way to look at the stuff that adds them
as suid-root slighlty mitigated by removal of some things.
I can do addition of capabilities via the same mechanism - it's trivial.
But I really doubt that we want it as first-class thing.
