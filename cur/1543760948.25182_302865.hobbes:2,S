I just noticed something else while reviewing this stuff.
The PTRS_PER_PMD macros aren't used anymore, so my hacks
to get 32-bit process VM operations optimized on sparc64
aren't even being used any more, ho hum... :-)  There are
better ways to do this.
(For the interested, see {REAL_}PTRS_PER_PMD in
 include/asm-sparc64/pgtable.h)
Come to think of it, this may be related somehow to whatever
is causing the problems.
