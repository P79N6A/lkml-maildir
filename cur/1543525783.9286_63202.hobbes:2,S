	Hello,
	If I run the attached program on my station the kernel oopses and
	hangs. I've tried 2.2.15pre5 and 2.3.36, 2.3.39 and they are ok. not
	tested 2.3.4[01]. I could'n get the oops(es) because they are bigger
	than my screen (132x60) - lots entries in Call Trace:
	could somebody confirm oopses for kernel 2.3.4[2345] with the
	attached program?
	# ./synk4 0 127.0.0.1 0 1023
