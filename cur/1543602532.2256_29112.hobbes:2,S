vm-tweaks-1 fixes things for me.  I've got 512MB ram (kernel not
configured for highmem) and 1 gig of swap.  The workload is heavy file
i/o and has now been running almost 24 hours (about 2 billion I/Os or
a few TB of data I think so far).  Previously all the memory was being
consumed by cache, nothing swapped (as expected if the memory is cached
buffer i/o right?) and I'd get the:
	__alloc_pages: 0-order allocation failed
Now I continue to see the memory consumption / no swap, and no more
error...iow the expected behaviour.
On an unrelated note if I want to backport the async I/O changes in 2.4.10,
are there patches from you I should apply other than:
	2.4.10pre10aa1/40_blkdev-pagecache-17
	2.4.7pre8aa1/41_blkdev-pagecache-5_drop_get_bh_async-1
