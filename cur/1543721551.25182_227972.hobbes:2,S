Subject: [2.6.7] AGP KT600 identified as CLE266

Hi all,
I've compiled vanilla kernel 2.6.7 just today, and I've noticed that my 
KT600 AGP chipset is identified ad CLE266 :
Linux agpgart interface v0.100 (c) Dave Jones
agpgart: Detected VIA CLE266 chipset
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 438M
agpgart: AGP aperture is 256M @ 0xc0000000
is this a bug or is normal?
Bye
Marcello
