In e1000 5.2.20 (as in earlier versions), the link-state reporters 
rely on netif_carrier_ok() for the state, which is in turned 
maintained by the driver's watchdog timer.
e1000_down() both cancels the watchdog timer and calls 
netif_carrier_off(), guaranteeing that if the interface is logically 
down, the link will be reported as down regardless of the actual link 
state.
I think e100 works the same way, though I haven't looked at the New & 
Improved version.
