__alloc_pages() should definitely not to loop forever but it should fail
the allocation instead. If it doesn't right now that is yet another bug,
at least with the 2.4 memory management design where we don't know if
there is memory available or not when we do the allocation. I'd really
appreciate if you could re-post this strictly necessary localized fix, I
will definitely agree about that one.
