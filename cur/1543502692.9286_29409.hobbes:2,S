Hello there
I've just obtained an used aptiva computer for next to nothing. What
bothers me is that linux doesn't detect the floppy controller (SMC
FDC37C935APM)
I don't like that the datasheet for the controller chip above says: Plug
and play compliant. 
All of this boils down to: Does linux support this chip, I get unknown
controller.
