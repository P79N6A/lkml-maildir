This looks really impossible.
I believe I see another bug in sys_timer_create(), but it is not related
to this problem.
sys_timer_create() inserts a partly initialized new_timer into posix_timers_id
and drops idr_lock. Suppose that another thread does sys_timer_delete(). If it
sees ->it_process != NULL, lock_timer() succeeds.
If the timer was not fully initialized at this time (or another CPU sees the
result of STOREs out of order), we can have multiple probles.
list_del() may oops, we can do put_task_struct() before sys_timer_create()
does get_task_struct(), we may leak the task_struct if sys_timer_delete()
doesn't see SIGEV_THREAD_ID yet.
Jeremy, I agree with Thomas that your patch should not be right, but it
does make a difference. Perhaps this is just the timing, but who knows.
Could you add some printk's to be sure that lock_timer() actually fails
while it never should?
Oleg.
