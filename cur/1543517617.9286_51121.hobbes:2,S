we kindof have this already, it's embedded in map_user_kiobuf() &
follow_page().

__generic_copy_from_user_nocheck() is the thing to be used i think - we
should not assume memcpy() works for (even if present) user-mappings.

i dont know. This interface breaks once we start doing multi-page
pagecache. We might want to simply unlock the page when doing the copy.
This also means that block allocation has to be done a bit more careful,
and partial writes first have to clear the whole page. (because the
unlocked page might be mmap()-ed or read() while the 'unlocked write' is
in progress.)
