There have certainly in the past been known problems with Sil SATA
controllers and Seagate drives due to both doing something stupid as far
as I understand it.  It seems this only applies to seagate drives with
an ide to sata convert onboard rather than a true native sata drive
(which only very resent models would be).  It also seems only the
Sil3112 controller has a stupid assumption that upsets the seagate sata
to ide convertor.

Well if what I have read about Sil + Seagate is correct, you can either
replace the drives with drives that follow the SATA standard correctly
(WD, Maxter, etc) or you can find another supported controller chip and
get a card using that.
I have no problem with the Sil3112A myself on an Asus board using WD
drives.
For me personally it has been simpler to avoid seagate drives than to
avoid Sil controllers given how often they are used as onboard
controllers on motherboards.
