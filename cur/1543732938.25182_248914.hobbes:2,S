Crosscheck of your new code vs the review:

Still not explanation

gone

ok

this comment is fixed, but the one later sent in private (stupid choice
of interface beteen upper pci dma code and pcibr code ignored)
> pci_extension.c:
> 
>  - dito.  Why does this single function need a separate file?
Not addressed.  In general your file organization is mess still.
Just do arch/ia64/sn/pci/ for all pci code and move the rest to
arch/ia64/sn/kernel.  That how most arches work.

Not addressed or commented on yet.

you still have typedefs for these around

ok

ok

the type pointer isn't done.  Any specific reason?

ok
More items:
 - sal_pcibr_rrb_alloc should be merged into its only caller
 - io_init.c still has KDB ifdefs
 - sn_pci_set_vchan should absolutely _not_ be placed in qla1280.c,
   and while you're at it there extern for snia_pcibr_rrb_alloc should
   move to a header
 - kill HUBREG_CAST instead of touching it
 - please don't put your ASSERT into asm/ headers.  In general you
   should use BUG_ON
 - why do you add a pfn_t typedef that's not used anywhere
 - the patch adds include/asm-ia64/sn/xtalk/xtalk_provider.h but there's
   no more xtalk providers
Your headers are still a complete mess.  There's no point exposing tons
of defails about the pci interface in include/asm - just keep and
pci_extensions.h there for non-standard PCI APIs, and the rest should
stay private inisde arch/ia64/sn/pci/.
