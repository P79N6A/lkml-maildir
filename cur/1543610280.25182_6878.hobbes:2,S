But x++ is postincrement though. That means the value of 'x' is inserted, 
and after the expression is evaluated, x is incremented. Right?
If we were going to be semiobscure, wouldn't the correct code be
#define MODINC(x,y) (x = ++x % y)
Btw, to the original guy: this loops 'x' around between 0 and (y-1) -- 
i.e., if y=5, and x=0, successive "calls" to this #define would do
MODINC(x,y);  // x=1
MODINC(x,y);  // x=2
MODINC(x,y);  // x=3
MODINC(x,y);  // x=4
MODINC(x,y);  // x=0
MODINC(x,y);  // x=1
MODINC(x,y);  // x=2
MODINC(x,y);  // x=3
...
