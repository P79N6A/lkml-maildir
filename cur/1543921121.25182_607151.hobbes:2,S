So how about something like this (untested! not necessarily very well 
thought through either!)
Basic notion: the only thing that serializes the IRQ_INPROGRESS flag is 
the descriptor lock. And we don't have to (or even want to!) hold it while 
waiting for the thing, but we want to *have*held*it* in between whatever 
we're synchronizing with.
The internal irq handler functions already held the lock when they did 
whatever they need to serialize - and they are possibly performance 
critical too - so they use the "internal" function that doesn't get the 
lock unnecessarily again.
Hmm?
