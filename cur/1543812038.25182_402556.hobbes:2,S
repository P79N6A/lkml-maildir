Nah, I was just curious.
Now notice that the max the device can take for a single USB frame is 64
bytes.  So if you send one urb at 16K, you should have plenty of cpu
time to queue up another one of the same size before that one flushes
out to the device, even if it is a high speed device.
That's the reason upping the size of this buffer will not really help
anyone out, except lazy userspace programmers :)
