Hmm, I would think that nagle would only come into play if those files
were each less than MSS and there were no intervening application level
reply/request messages for each. So, perhaps rcp, but not FTP nor HTTP.
I'm not sure where the break-even point versus send() is on other OSes,
but it seems to be in the neighborhood of the typical ethernet MSS on
HP-UX.
As for the header/trailer stuff, you're right, I should have spec'd a
separate iovec for each :)

I'm not sure, but I think I've just been insulted !-) (in case it is not
clear, that is meant as a joke...)
