Reading this I realize it's confusing... :(
Because a process issuing a futex() syscall cannot point to another process vm 
(without giving more information than just a virtual address), I do think :
1) pthread_cond_broadcast() SHOULD use FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE if :
condvar & mutex are PSHARED
2) pthread_cond_broadcast() MUST use FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PRIVATE if :
condvar & mutex are PRIVATE
3) if condvar is PRIVATE and mutex is SHARED, a FUTEX_WAKE_PRIVATE should be 
done. (and loose the REQUEUE optim)
Yes we could add a special futex primitive for this special case. But I cannot 
see how a program could use such a construct.
4) if condvar is SHARED and mutex is private, we have a *problem*, because the 
process doing the broadcast() can be in another mm. So a requeue is not 
possible at all. -> a FUTEX_WAKE is necessary (no REQUEUE optim)
I guess it's OK performance wise since the notifier in this case probably 
doesnt hold a lock on the mutex. And probably old glibc was doing same thing, 
since the mutex address stored in condvar was possibly in another vm, and 
notifier had the same problem.
Thanks
