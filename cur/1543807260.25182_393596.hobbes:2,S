That's unhelpful unless you are suggesting that Linux no
longer supports running the 32-bit kernel on 64-bit hardware.
If that is the case, it ought to detect the incompatibility
and refuse to boot.
My clock was going about 1.414 times as fast as it ought to.
Why that looks like the square root of two I don't know.
There have been far too many other problems with i386 timekeeping as well.
Really, it's crazy to not use the pmtmr if the pmtmr is available. The next
best choice would be HPET. After that, pre-SMM systems should count clock
ticks and post-SMM systems should read the RTC or PIT registers. Until we
accept this, we'll always be suffering clock problems.
