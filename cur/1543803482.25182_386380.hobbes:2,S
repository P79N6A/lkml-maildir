This includes all patches from 2.6.15.2 so use 2.6.15 as your base.

Split patches available.
*NOTE*
If you're looking for the 1GB lowmem option it has been replaced and you 
should choose the following in menuconfig for the same effect:
( ) 3G/1G user/kernel split
(X) 3G/1G user/kernel split (for full 1G low memory)
( ) 2G/2G user/kernel split
( ) 1G/3G user/kernel split
Changes
Added:
 +sched-staircase13.2_13.3.patch
Microoptimisations (thanks Andreas Mohr) and patch merge typofix.
