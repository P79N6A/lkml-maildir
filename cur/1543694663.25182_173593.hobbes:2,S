The distribution of RAM failure over time is different.  Most failure of RAM
tend to be in the first few days or even hours.  After that the rate drops
to a very low value for the next few years.  In other words a long warranty
time won't cause alot of cost for the manufacturer nor benefit customers
much.  But it looks good in advertisment ...
