Well it is a non-fixed number of entries so it does not sound appropriate for
a sysctl.  sysctl tends to work well for simple settings, not complicated things.
/proc/net would be the easy place, although I think traditionally /proc/net
is just reporting.
Given the context I will suggest setsockopt as most of iptables is configured
using that.
Generally going beyond one value per file is discouraged, in any context.
So I guess the general advice is don't have that scenario :)
In your situation I would find something in the kernel that does something
similar and see how it provides for a user interface.  If there is a way
that it is done for similar modules do that. 
If there is no precedent something under sysfs likely makes the most sense.
/proc is really supposed for things related to processes.
I usually spend my time keeping the old things going and useful in new and
interesting situations instead of figuring out the interface recommendation
of the week.
I would be really surprised if your configuration requirements were unique
and there weren't several somethings in the kernel that solved the
same problem in a different way.
