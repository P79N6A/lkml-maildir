Fair enough.

How long is this thing supposed to run? I left '0' running for a long time
and it didn't seem to finish - had quite a few processes running fine and
no complaints.
When I run the '1' varient I got among the list of processes a moan about:
started process 16111
shmctl IPC_RMID: Invalid argument
started process 16112
shmctl IPC_RMID: Invalid argument
shmctl IPC_RMID: Invalid argument
shmctl IPC_RMID: Identifier removed
followed by a core dump.
It looks like 'ptr' (return value of shmat ?) is -1

UP.
