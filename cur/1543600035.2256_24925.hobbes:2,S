No one said mine was bootable either :-)  It builds.  Booting has yet to be
tested (must fix dinner first.)
The things I go through for my "neat toys" (firewire on an alpha)  On a side
note, the Alpha BIOS Emulation (tm) isn't exactly perfect... the Mylex RAID
configuration stuff won't run -- I know I'm asking alot *grin*  I'll try it
with the DPT (I20) controller in a while. (It ain't easy putting cards in
my alpha.  I've bled on it a few times in the process already.)
