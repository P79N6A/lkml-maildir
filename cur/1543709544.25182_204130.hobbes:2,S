Ah yes, as a side effect of me being a bit too quick with my
kernel/Kconfig.kgdb changes, yes.  Good catch :)

I would rather not have to duplicate the above code (or, any code) for

But eth_read_char, etc aren't, don't need to be, and shouldn't be global
functions.

I think this is backwards.  Stop thinking in terms of 8250, eth and arch
serial, but instead io1, io2 and io3 (and io4, and io5, ...).  I don't
see what's wrong with what dwmw2 suggested that I passed along.
