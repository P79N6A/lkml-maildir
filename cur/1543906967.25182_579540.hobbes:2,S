actually, it's popular practice to disable it by people who know how big a 
hit it is and know how few programs use it.
i've been a linux sysadmin for 10 years, and have known about noatime for 
at least 7 years, but I always thought of it in the catagory of 'use it 
only on your performance critical machines where you are trying to extract 
every ounce of performance, and keep an eye out for things misbehaving'
I never imagined that itwas the 20%+ hit that is being described, and with 
so little impact, or I would have switched to it across the board years 
ago.
I'll bet there are a lot of admins out there in the same boat.
adding an option in the kernel to change the default sounds like a very 
good first step, even if the default isn't changed today.
