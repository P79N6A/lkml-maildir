To elaborate: the thing is called if we get a contention on the page lock.
Essentially, its use in NFS is renice -20 for the requests on our page
wrt RPC scheduler. By the time when page gets unlocked it becomes a NOP.
On local filesystems it just runs the tq_disk - nothing in common with
the NFS case and IMO Trond was wrong lumping them together. In effect,
we are getting run_task_queue(&tq_disk) executed _very_ often and I'm less
than sure that it's a good idea. I think that ->sync_page() is not a
well-defined operation and NFS scheduler should use the locking of its own,
both for inavlidate_... and here.
