From my findings revision 81 is KL133/KL133A (and only KL133 is affected
by clearing bit 5 in 0x55, KL133A works fine in both configs). KM133/KM133A
have revision 84, and KM133 is affected (I have no idea about KM133A).

As now we have also report (from G550 user) that PCI -> AGP transfers 
are broken when bit 5 is cleared, I think that playing dangerous games
with northbridge is only way to go.
