Actually, where that BUG_ON was is the exiting of the chain walk. So it
does stop.  It's the higher priority task that needs to be continuing
the chain walk for that problem to occur.  So really, it already does
what you suggest :)

But, as PI matures, it seems to be more and more acceptable.

Yes it did, but I need to clearify.  I have a custom kernel that is
based on Ingo's -rt patch, and I hit this bug on touching other parts of
the PI list.  When looking at fixing it, I realized that the BUG_ON
condition, was legitimate.
Also, I always test on SMP (then I test on UP) and the chain walkers
were on two CPUs.
