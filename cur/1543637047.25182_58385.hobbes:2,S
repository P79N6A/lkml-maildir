And this patch is an updated zap_page_range() now using the new approach
I posted and Linus's suggested cond_resched_lock method (previous
patch).
Personally I still prefer the simpler loop method... note that the
cond_resched_lock() assumes that the lock depth is ALWAYS 1 - e.g., we
explicitly call schedule.  A safer alternative would be break_spin_lock
which will preemptively reschedule automatically, but only if
preempt_count==0 (and only with the preemptible kernel enabled).
This patch also has the other cleanups/optimizations from the original
zap_page_range patch - same patch as before but with the new method. 
Patch is against 2.5 BK.
