No, this is not specific to memcg or cpuset cases alone. The same needless 
kills will take place even without memcg or cpuset when an administrator 
specifies a light memory consumer to be killed before a heavy memory user. But 
it is up to the administrator to use it wisely. We also provide a panic_on_oom 
option that an administrator could use, not just to kill few more tasks but 
all tasks in the system ;)
