Well aren't these expected errors? You want to attach an non-existent 
front-end and the driver finds out it isn't there? IMHO it doesn't look very 
professional if some strange errors are scattered in the log. I think if you 
don't find *any* front-end there should be perhaps an error or note to the 
user, but not because half a dozen of front-ends drivers can't find the hw. 
At least please make the errors verbose and not cryptical, if you really want 
them.
If these errors are not expected, they have been here since months and 
probably should have been fixed. But I think I remember someone saying that 
they are expected once I reported them...

Well, I got twice annoyed by missing reverse dependecies introduced by new 
front-ends. Once the fw loader and once the new lgt330x(?) front-end. If new 
front-ends wouldn't go in automatically as rev dependency this wouldn't break 
for me (and everyone alse using b2c2 in general and not only the new 
frontends), which is another reason, if you don't care about the bit of code 
saving.
I really don't see the big problem of the ifdefs as the are in the *header* 
files as it is just checking whether something is in or not - as the user 
selected thus emulating that a probe for a front-end failed... If the .c file 
is coded properly there is no chance of breaking - otherwise you'd have the 
same problem with the unpatched source (leaving the module problem out for 
now). (Yes, I know ifdefs in the code as such are bad, but I noted that in 
conjunction with the fw loader, which was the only "dirty" ifdef.)
And as I said I added an *option* for unsure users to include all supported 
front-ends, which is another one of your arguments. Selecting it by default 
(I don't know how to do this) would be what you want then. Wouldn't this make 
all happy (if Michael additionally fixes the module stuff)?
