Not "one character", it's "one byte".

The problem is that your code matches one byte, not one character.
More or less all userspace programs handle multi-byte UTF-8 characters 
just fine without bothering the user with the fact whether a character 
consists of one or more bytes.
And users will try to use this \? for matching one character when 
writing a pattern that denies access.
That's not just a documentation problem.
