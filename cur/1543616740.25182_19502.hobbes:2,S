Hello Andrea,
I did my usual compile testings (untar kernel archive, apply patches,
make -j<value> ...

So far 2.4.13-pre5aa1 had been the king of the block in compile times.
But this has changed. Now the (by far) fastest kernel is 2.4.18-pre
+ Ingos scheduler patch (s) + preemptive patch (p). I did not test
preemptive patch alone so far since I don't know if the one I have
applies cleanly against -pre3 without Ingos patch. I used the
following patches:
s: sched-O1-2.4.17-H6.patch
p: preempt-kernel-rml-2.4.18-pre3-ingo-1.patch
I hope this info is useful to someone.
Kind regards,
   Jogi
