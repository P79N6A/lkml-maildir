If that is the case iget is broken. Perhaps it should test for these
states in find_inode (and find_inode_fast) and never return them. Are
those types of inodes still on the inode hash?

Well, considering that this function (modulo the I_FREEING|I_CLEAR test
is identical to the first 10 lines in iget5_locked, this could call that
function. Ofcourse iget_locked is using the 'fast' version of find_inode.
