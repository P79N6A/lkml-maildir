Hmm, ok. I undestand your point.
In "cpu is broken, so we have to remove it" case, my patch is harmful.
But (unpredictable) forced migration will cause something bad to user regardless
of scheduling type.
Should we send signal (kill or stop) to tasks whose cpus_allowed only contains
removed cpu rather than simple migration ?
(if this was discussed in past, I'm sorry)
