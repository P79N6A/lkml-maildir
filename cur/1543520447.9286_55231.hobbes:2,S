It is a know problem with several recent BIOS's (unfortunately).  You need
to get the patch off the APM home page (
http://linuxcare.com.au/apm/
)
and recompile your kernel after enabling the "Real mode power off"
configuration option.

Your BIOS is buggy. Windows returns to real mode before calling
the APM BIOS power off routine.  Linux normally does not (and should
not need to).  Complain to your MB manfacturer (first see if there is
an updated BIOS on their web site).  We have managed to get this fixed
in some BIOS's.

This is the give away ... the BIOS is trying to access a real mode
segment while we are still in protected mode.

This means the BIOS is executing ...
