See earlier in this thread, 24th July.

It depends what the reasoning is behind them.  The touchscreen driver
is threaded because it wants to collect touschreen samples independently
of the availability of a user thread.  Moreover, obtaining ADC samples
needs a sleeping context since it may take a while to complete.
However, putting all UCB interrupts into a thread does not make sense
to me - if we allow UCB interrupts to sleep, it allows one UCB interrupt
to be processed at the exclusion of the others.
