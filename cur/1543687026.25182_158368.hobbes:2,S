Of course, the more correct approach is for someone to convert them to
use the new serial driver core (and fix the driver core interface to
allow them to work with it.)
Unfortunately I don't have the hardware for a lot of these specialist
serial cards, so it's a job I've steared clear of.  I've been hoping
that leaving them broken will make the ones which are used stand out,
and hopefully someone with the hardware would've picked them up and
done the necessary conversion.
But alas no.
(I did my best to convert dz.c without the hardware, but it seems to
have been lost into the depths of the MIPS tree... *hint*)
