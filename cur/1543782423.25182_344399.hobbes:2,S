No - I don't think redundant, at least not this change in isolation.
Perhaps redundant in light of subsequent code lines, as Jesper notes in
his followup.
But it is confusing to read - poor and inconsistent choice of code
phrasing.
If the patch had read as:
    -		if (*type == '\n') {
    +		if (*type == '\n' || *type == '\0') {
then it would be clearer to the reader in my view.  A check for newline
is changed to a check for newline or nul-byte.
(Yes - I recognize that one is not given the freedom to change the
-old- lines in a patch for the sake of clarity ;).
