SETFEATURES_XFER stuff is magic anyway because some controllers snoop.
Also of course like the old IDE we send some rather iffy PIO requests
and that might have something to do with the problem of course.
I've got two reports that look similar and are from ALi controllers so
trying the 10uS version might be worth doing, at least for PATA
