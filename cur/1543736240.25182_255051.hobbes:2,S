Well, the kernel is (or should be) a freestanding program, so it
shouldn't use *any* external code (and it doesn't, intentionally).
We're working hard not linking in libgcc.a (IIRC some archs actually do
that) (because eg. your compiler was compiled for i686-pc-linux-gnu, you
want to compile for a real i386 and end up with Pentium-alike code in
your i386 kernel).
So people started doing freestanding implementations of eg. __udivsi3 in
their kernel files. But why should they? GCC also could have emitted
inlined code to do that task, without ever calling an external function
for that.
However, this topic has been discussed several times with no real
resolution, so I guess we won't find a real cool solution this time,
too.
MfG, JBG (and greetings from Oldenburg!)
