Hmm. Things seem to have progressed since I was last online :-)
With Alexey's original patch I also get a number of times:
ACPI: element[12]->type = 1, expected string

With 'battery_allow_extract_string_from_integer.patch' all info in /proc is 
back and I now also see the new files in /sys/class/power_supply.
The "OEM info" field (line 13 in BAT1/info) is empty, just as it was empty 
in 2.6.23 too.
