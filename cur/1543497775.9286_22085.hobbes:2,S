I have some serious concerns because of this.  I have installed Redhat 6.0 on my work machine and it is eating up huge amounts of memory with Gnome and E. It is seriously giving me second thoughts about installing it on my laptop which is limited to 40 megs of ram.  (And I do not have another $1600+ to invest in another laptop.) I realize it is not a kernel problem (yet), but it could be.
Unfortunatly there is alot of legacy hardware out there.  You may not use it, but lots of people still do.
