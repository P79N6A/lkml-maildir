I wonder what's the right way for an app to ask the kernel if, for example,
tsc is available. As you stated above, executing CPUID is probably wrong.
But if the process parses /proc/cpuinfo, it has to make sure tsc is available
on all cpus it may run on, doesn't it? 
What about some system call stating 'I want to use feature XYZ'. If all CPUs
implement XYZ, the system call simply returns some ACK, and NACK if no CPU 
implements it (and no emulation is available). 
If only some CPUs implement the feature, the kernel may return NACK,
or it may make sure the process will only run on CPUs implementing the
feature and return ACK. Is this usefull? It's just an idea ;-) I wonder
if there are many features that may be available only on some CPUs in an
'SMP' system.
