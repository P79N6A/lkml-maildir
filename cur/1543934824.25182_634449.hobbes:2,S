It's a ipv4 tcp socket:
// error handling & other noise removed:
int fd = socket(PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,0);
struct sockaddr_in server_addr;
memset(&server_addr,0,sizeof(server_addr));
server_addr.sin_family=AF_INET;
server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr=htonl(INADDR_ANY);
server_addr.sin_port=htons(port);
bind(fd,(struct sockaddr*)&server_addr,sizeof(server_addr));
listen(listenfd,128);

There are two odd things happening:
1. ERESTARTSYS is escaping to user-space, rather than EINTR or 
restarting the accept.
2. It gets out of libc into my code in the form ret=-512, not (ret=-1, errno=512).
Very odd; a user-space mess (e.g. stack corruption) shouldn't be able 
to change the kernel behaviour, and a kernel problem shouldn't cause 
the odd libc behaviour.  There must be another explanation....
Phil.
