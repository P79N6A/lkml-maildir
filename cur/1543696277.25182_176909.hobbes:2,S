From mount(8):
       (iii) Normally, only the superuser can mount file systems.
       However, when fstab  contains the "user" option on a line,
       anybody can mount the corresponding system.
       Thus, given a line
              /dev/cdrom  /cd  iso9660  ro,user,noauto,unhide
       any user can mount the iso9660 file system  found  on  his
       CDROM using the command
              mount /dev/cdrom
       or
              mount /cd
       ...                 The owner option  is  similar  to  the
       user  option,  with  the restriction that the user must be
       the owner of the special file. This may be useful e.g. for
       /dev/fd  if a login script makes the console user owner of
       this device.
That is: the syntax is "owner", not "owner=...".
Also, this is an option handled by mount, so kernel version
should play no role.
However, 2.6 does more strict option checking, and complains
about unknown options, while 2.4 in many places just ignores them.
