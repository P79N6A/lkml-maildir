Not necessarily ! See RFC1469.
Either 0x80 or 0x01 is valid for broadcast *but*
0x80 is valid for multicast when the functional address C0 00 00 04 00 00 is being used (rfc 1469 option 2) 
0x01 is valid for multicast when unicast addresses (i.e. 01 00 5E with lower 23 bits set) (rfc 1469 option 3) are being used. (At least some Olympic based cards can do this)
This is my thinking so far.  (Trying to implement multicasting for the new olympic drivers.)
We need to work this through before patching the kernel !!
