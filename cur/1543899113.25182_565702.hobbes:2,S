Subject: [PATCH] memory unplug v7 - migration by kernel
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/6/95

page migration by kernel v6.
Changelog V6->V7
 - moved rcu_read_lock/rcu_read_unlock to correct place.
 - fixed text.
Changelog V5->V6
 - removed dummy_vma and uses rcu_read_lock().
 - removed page_mapped() check and uses !page->mapping check.
In usual, migrate_pages(page,,) is called with holding mm->sem by system call.
(mm here is a mm_struct which maps the migration target page.)
This semaphore helps avoiding some race conditions.
But, if we want to migrate a page by some kernel codes, we have to avoid
some races. This patch adds check code for following race condition.
1. A page which page->mapping==NULL can be target of migration. Then, we have
   to check page->mapping before calling try_to_unmap().
2. anon_vma can be freed while page is unmapped, but page->mapping remains as
   it was. We drop page->mapcount to be 0. Then we cannot trust page->mapping.
   So, use rcu_read_lock() to prevent anon_vma pointed by page->mapping from
   being freed during migration.
