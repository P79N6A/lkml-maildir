umm, OK.  Could we please have some sort of statement pinning down the
exact semantics of __GFP_MOVABLE, and what its envisaged applications are?
My concern is that __GFP_MOVABLE is useful for fragmentation-avoidance, but
useless for memory hot-unplug.  So that if/when hot-unplug comes along
we'll add more gunk which is a somewhat-superset of the GFP_MOVABLE
infrastructure, hence we didn't need the GFP_MOVABLE code.  Or something.
That depends on how we do hot-unplug, if we do it.  I continue to suspect
that it'll be done via memory zones: effectively by resurrecting
GFP_HIGHMEM.  In which case there's little overlap with anti-frag.  (btw, I
have a suspicion that the most important application of memory hot-unplug
will be power management: destructively turning off DIMMs).
I'd also like to pin down the situation with lumpy-reclaim versus
anti-fragmentation.  No offence, but I would of course prefer to avoid
merging the anti-frag patches simply based on their stupendous size.  It
seems to me that lumpy-reclaim is suitable for the e1000 problem, but
perhaps not for the hugetlbpage problem.  Whereas anti-fragmentation adds
vastly more code, but can address both problems?  Or something.
IOW: big-picture where-do-we-go-from-here stuff.
