	Hi Sam,
When I use `make ARCH=m68k INSTALL_HDR_PATH=/tmp/headers headers_install',
I get lots of `.install' and `..install.cmd' files in /tmp/headers and its
subdirectories.
I'm building the kernel in a separate output directory and run my make command
from there.
Is this intentional?
Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
