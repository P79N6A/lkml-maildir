The rule is simple enough.  After calling kobject_register() you should 
always use kobject_put() -- even if kobject_register() failed.
In fact, after calling kobject_init() you should use kobject_put().  
The first rule follows from this one, since kobject_register() calls 
kobject_init() internally.
