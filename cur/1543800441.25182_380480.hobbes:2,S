Doubt it.  From 'info make', Node: Environment.
   Variables in `make' can come from the environment in which `make' is
  run.  Every environment variable that `make' sees when it starts up
  is transformed into a `make' variable with the same name and value.
  But an explicit assignment in the makefile, or with a command
  argument, overrides the environment.  (If the `-e' flag is specified,
  then values from the environment override assignments in the
  makefile.  *Note Summary of Options: Options Summary.  But this is
  not recommended practice.)
The kernel Makefile explicitly sets CC which overrides the environment
value, but does not override a command line definition of CC.  IOW, do
not reply on environment variables always working with make.
