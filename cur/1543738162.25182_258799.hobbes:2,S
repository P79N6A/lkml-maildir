Same here.

Well, that CPU is useless ;-)  Otherwise the thing is still responding. 
One thing I noticed is the swap usage:
# grep Swap proc/meminfo
SwapCached:          4 kB
SwapTotal:     2031608 kB
SwapFree:      2031604 kB
So, I'm guessing the first page that went out to swap started this thing
off.

I do have some local changes too.  But nothing that should trigger this.

Memory's a bit tighter here, but still 55M free though.
