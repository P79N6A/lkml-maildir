not too many. This is largely because hardware interfaces are getting
increasingly standardized (it's cheaper for the hw vendors to not have
to create a new driver for Windows XP)

some. But the vast majority is "good enough" by any standard.

then it's clear that linux is better off ;)
(and yes while XP has more drivers, in linux a driver would generally
drive the hardware that in the windows world uses 10 to 20  drivers)

And for non-standard interfaces.. it's increasingly done with the vendor
help

yes. But "more binary drivers" is absolutely not "better off"; but
that's going towards the usual bimonthly troll topic so lets not go
there and stop here.
