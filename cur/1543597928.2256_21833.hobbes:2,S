Subject: Problems with PCMCIA IDE interface in laptop

I have been unable to get my laptop to work with a PCMCIA
IDE adapter.  Actually I've tried two, an EZ-GIG and another one
that I had from a couple years back.
The overall effect is:
Aug 15 17:33:27 parrotnoid cardmgr[506]: initializing socket 0 
Aug 15 17:33:27 parrotnoid cardmgr[506]: socket 0: ATA/IDE Fixed Disk 
Aug 15 17:33:27 parrotnoid cardmgr[506]: executing: 'modprobe ide-cs' 
Aug 15 17:33:28 parrotnoid cardmgr[506]: get devinfo on socket 0 failed: Resource temporarily unavailable 
What does the "resource temporarily unavailable" message mean?  Is this
a race condition?
Sometimes there is an additional line from cs about the memory
mapping, but that's all.  I never see any hd(x) messages from the kernel.
I have more comments in my posting to the sourceforge PCMCIA forum:
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=33430
Basically I can see the card okay but the ide driver seems unable to
cope with it.
Machine is a FIVA MPC-206e.  Kernel is 2.4.8.  Using kernel PCMCIA and
up-to-date Card Services.
