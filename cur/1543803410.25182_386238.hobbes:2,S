I tried it with both an Ethernet adapter (realtek) and a pci sound card 
(Creative SoundBlaster.)  The Ethernet adapter works fine with both live-cd 
(slax) and hd-install (archlinux) but I can't get the the soundcard to work 
with alsa on archlinux.  However, as it does play when using /dev/dsp2 
strait, this is possibly a different problem.
I guess I'll go ask on the madwifi mailing list.  Sorry about the noise...

My guess is that they're not to proud of that detail...
Any way, I had forgotten about that.  I suppose my 'same results with two 
different drivers' reasoning melts away with that.
Thanks,
