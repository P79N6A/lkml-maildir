   Dave nailed this bug, Anton you'll want to apply it before testing :-)
   It fixes a case of too much copy'n paste with back merges +
   DMA_CHUNK_SIZE enabled.
There still are problems even after this fix.
In fact the failures look identical to what I was seeing
before, first dbench from single user is insta-crash.
