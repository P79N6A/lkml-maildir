Well, netfilter ports should be a u16, so it's naturally contrained
(although 0 would be very unusual).  If max_batch were unsigned, rcu
would be fixed too (although we have 0 again as the odd case).
I don't really want the churn of making them all take range args
and adding "#define PARAM_NO_RANGE 0, -1".  Perhaps doubling the number
of macros is the right approach.

Fortunately sprintf("%s") handles NULL, which was my main concern, so
this is OK IMHO.
I think my bigger question is: is this going in the right direction?
Should we instead be doing something like eg. "block/hda/dev=3:0", and
trying to connect the pipes so the driver's sysfs entries are
initialized by the parameter parsing code?
Should we be using module parameters to control device settings at all?
I don't know the answers here, but I share your discomfort over the
current module parameter <-> device parameter mapping.
(Hoping Greg KH will have an opinion here...)
Thanks!
Rusty.
