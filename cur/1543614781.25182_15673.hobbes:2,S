Perhaps we're talking past each other.  I don't understand your objection
yet, and I want to so I can design (or redesign) to meet it.
When I talk about "rules that use architecture symbols to suppress
things like bus types" I have in mind things like this:
unless X86 suppress dependent MCA EISA
unless MIPS32 suppress dependent TC
unless (PCI and (X86 or SUPERH)) suppress pci_access
unless (ISA or PCI) suppress dependent IDE
unless PCI suppress dependent USB HOTPLUG_PCI
unless (X86 or ALPHA or MIPS32 or PPC) suppress usb
unless (X86 and PCI and EXPERIMENTAL) or PPC or ARM or SPARC suppress dependent IEEE1394
unless (M68K or ALL_PPC) suppress MACINTOSH_DRIVERS
unless SPARC suppress dependent FC4
unless ARCH_S390==n suppress buses
It seems to me *extremely* unlikely that a typical patch from a PPC maintainer
would mess with any of these!  They're rules that are likely to be written
once at the time a new port is added to the tree and seldom or ever changed
afterwards.
Thus I really don't think you have to worry about spurious spikes in
your diffstat.  The root rules.cml file will not change very often --
I know this is true, because I can look at the RCS history since I
broke it out in response to your request at the Kernel Summit and
*see* that changes have been few and sparse.

Rightly so in the latter case.  Configure.help patches shouldn't worry
you, I don't think.  It's not like they can actually break anything.

It sounds to me like you're agreeing that it *shouldn't* be called
different things, and thus with my goal of cleaning this mess up the
rest of the way.  Yes?  No?
Guidance, please.  I am, as ever, willing to meet your concerns.  
But I have to understand clearly what they are in order to do that.
