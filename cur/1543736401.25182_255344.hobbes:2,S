All in-tree references to remap_page_range() have been removed by prior
patches in the series. This patch, intended to be applied after some
waiting period for people to adjust to the API change, notice
__deprecated, etc., does the final removal of remap_page_range() as a
function symbol declared within kernel headers and/or implemented in
kernel sources.
