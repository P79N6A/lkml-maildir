hmm. Ok so you either need the MOD_INC_USE_COUNT or you don't, but if
you do it should go before the sleeping kmalloc ;)

since addr_len is a signed value, a user that passes -1 will get a
LOOOONG copy_from_user scribbling all over kernel memory...same for
data_len a few lines onwards

is that unconditional udelay with interrupts off really needed?

I get the feeling this locking is fishy. A double r/w lock smells bad.
really. Either you always take both the same way (eg both for read or
both for write) and then the inner lock could be a normal spinlock; or
you will deadlock in new and surprising ways....

ehm ehm didn't just take TWO spinlocks 3 lines above this sleeping
function ?
