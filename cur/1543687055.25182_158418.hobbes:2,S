Note that pdflush is already doing this.  It doesn't seem to work very well
though:
a) new threads seem to start up too late
b) they probably don't hang around for long enough
c) now that pdflush avoids blocking on queues it's all rather overkill
   anyway.
pdflush could kinda-sorta be converted to use workqueues, but it doesn't
want a thread per cpu.
