I've seen several questions about this subject but no real answers - any
ideas/insites would be of help.
Here's my situation:
Running RH 5.2 - full install, all updates
2.2.2/3/4 Kernel - all produce same results -- 2.0.36 kernel worked fine --
haven't tried 2.2.5 yet.
Have compiled and installed the latest PCMCIA source (3.0.9) from David Hinds
When I boot machine OUT of the docking station the CD-ROM works flawlessly.
dmesg shows:
...

However, when I boot machine IN the docking station (with or without PCMCIA
cards installed in dock):
mount /dev/cdrom hangs terminal and produces hdc: lost interrupt messages
