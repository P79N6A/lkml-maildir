I took another look at the section I found.  It doesn't describe much, but it
shows "000c: *signal* signal=5" for example, which are probably SIGTRAP's.
I decided to capture a log running under a kernel before the change, and see 
if I could find the same section again, based on the mutex name.  Well I did, 
and found alot more tracing.  The thread 000c didn't get killed either so it
shows something is different.  Of course under the old kernels I don't get the
"insert disc" message.  I put up the working version log on the ftp.
