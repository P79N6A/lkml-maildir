It is 300 watts. Does switching virtual consoles really require extra
wattage? :>
Every single one of these crashes (4 so far) has happened that way - it's
waaaay too consistent to be hardware.
If I overclock to 500mhz, it'll still crash once a week, and it'll still be
during a virtual console switch. :)
The memory, disks, scsi cards, video card, netcards, case, power supply, and
modem (basically, everything except the BP6, chips, and fans) have been
perfectly stable (several ~100 day uptimes) even with a celeron 300 running
at 375 (4.5*83.3).
