Yes, that's what I'm interested in trying. In the SH case we can
basically make use of the on-chip DMAC for any non-PCI device. Some of
these permit scatterlists and chained DMA in hardware, others do not. The
general problem is that since we have to go and poke at the dcache prior
to kicking off the DMA, it's rarely a win for a small number of pages,
memory bursts just end up being faster.
The other issue is that most of the "big" writers are doing so via mmap()
anyways, so it's futile to attempt to handle the DMA case in the
->write() path. Your approach seems like it might be an appropriate
interface for building something like this on top of.
Given that, this would have to be something that's dealt with at the
subsystem level rather than in individual drivers, hence the desire to
see something like this more generically visible.
