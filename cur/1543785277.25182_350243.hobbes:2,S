It's removed because without VM_ACCOUNT it was steadily leaking:
the main path was wrong, never mind the error path.  We could add
VM_ACCOUNT to the flags to fix that, but in 99.999% of cases we
should not be accounting these - all mms are sharing the same page.
Ben designed it to allow for gdb setting breakpoints in the vDSO
page (COW then giving a private page), but that's an very unusual
case, which isn't handled quite right anyway: we need to take a
separate look at that sometime - we account for what's VM_WRITE,
not for what ptrace might write to by the backdoor.
