Fucks with CF and not in a good way...
CF := $(PROFILING) -mcmodel=small -fPIC -g0 -O2 -fasynchronous-unwind-tables -m64
$(obj)/vclock_gettime.o: CFLAGS = $(CF)
$(obj)/vgetcpu.o: CFLAGS = $(CF)
s/CF/CCF/ in there (arch/x86_64/vdso/Makefile) fixes gcc problems; sparse
ones remain and I'll look into that when I get some sleep (26 hours uptime
right now).  I think I have a good idea of what's going on there, but
I'd rather not touch that code until tonight.
For now just rename the variable in makefile (obviously the right thing
to do) and that will give you sparse runs not aborted at that point.
