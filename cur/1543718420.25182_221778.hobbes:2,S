I found the time to brush up on my assembly a little, and using the 
PPC/32 and
PPC/64 implementations of _raw_write_lock and the PPC/64 implementation
of _raw_write_trylock for reference I hacked together a patch.  There 
are
probably bugs in it as I'm still a little rusty, so it needs someone 
skilled in PPC
assembly to review it, but hopefully it will work.  I'll try compiling 
it into my
kernel tomorrow to see if it works. (I won't have access to the machine 
in
question untill then, sorry).
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
