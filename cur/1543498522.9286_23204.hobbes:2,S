Hello!!
I have a big problem with my Opl3-Sa3 soundchip: it will not work.
The chip is built-in-to my moderboard: Intel 440Lx pci-set.
I have tried many thing, but nothing will work...
I am using "make menuconfig" to setup the configure file, and when i have configured it right (i think) i compile the kernel, boot with the new kernel and try to use some programs that uses sound, but it will not work anyway.
(I get the soundchip-info from the Opensound (the version that not is free). When I use opensound i can get sound, in 20 minutes for the demo version only: Not so fun.)
Some hacker that know what I have to do or/and how to setup the kernel-config-file right to get the soundchip to work??
(I have the same problem in FreeBSD 3.1-release, but opensound is nicer there: I have sound in 3 hours, then i have to restart the sound-program)
Some info:
 I have tried all the kernels from version 2.1.121, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.9, and now the 2.3-kernels, but unfortuntly nothing will work. (Now i use 2.3.5)
 My computer is a Dell Dimesion XPS D266.
 It is a 266MHz PII with 64mb ram.
 The soundchip is built in to the moderboard, so i cant get it of from the moderboard =(.
 I am using SuSE 6.0 (and freebsd 3.1-release) and have tried Debian 2.0 too, but the sound will not work...
(I am not so good writing english, so don't look at all the spelling-mistakes ;-)
