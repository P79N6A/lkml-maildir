Unfortunately it is not the same reason that locks up my machine ;(
On SIS 735 motherboard, with agpgart, sis-agp and radeon loaded, I get
this on the serial console before the machine freezes:
   agpgart: Found an AGP 2.0 compliant device.
   agpgart: Putting AGP V2 device at 00:00.0 into 4x mode
   agpgart: Putting AGP V2 device at 01:00.0 into 4x mode
Without these modules loaded, the machine is stable.
I am using XFree86 4.3.0 with a Radeon 8500.
Please let me know if you need more details or you have a patch for
testing.
Cheers,
florin
