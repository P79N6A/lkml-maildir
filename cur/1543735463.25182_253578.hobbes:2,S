Since I'm a bit keen on actually being able to read the cards I already 
own I have another suggestion. Start out using a zero OCR. If no card 
responds using this we try again using the bit mask created in this 
patch. That would get compliant cards using the first go and the rest 
using the second. If someone tries to combine faulty cards with good 
ones on the same bus the faulty ones will of course not work but at 
least people have the chance of getting them to work when inserted by 
themselves.
Does this sound like a solution that would work? I'd be happy to write 
the code and test it with the cards I have at my disposal.
