Sorry. That should have been: We migrate irqs that are not directed at the

Yes inside. 
An irq migration currently requires two instances of the irq firing to
complete.  Once on the source cpu once on the target cpu.
Migrating irqs while the irq is alive is a royal pain.

Because you are calling unfixably broken code.  That should be a decent
incentive to do something else won't it?
IOAPICs do not support what the code is doing here.  There is lots of
practical evidence including bad experiences and practical tests that
support this.
I suspect the only reason you don't have problems is that the irqs are
already shut down at the source before we get to this code path.

CONFIG_BROKEN is quite likely excessive but the code is totally and
unfixably broken.  So it still doesn't feel wrong to me.
Perhaps we should just disable swap suspend on SMP until we get a
design that can be implemented correctly on existing hardware.  I am
not happy with people telling me that we must keep broken code because
people with brand new SMP laptops will scream otherwise.  Since the
fundamental problems in this code path don't appear to bite people
very frequently I don't mind waiting while an alternative solution is
debugged and tested, but there is no way it makes sense to keep this
code in service more for more than a kernel release or two.
