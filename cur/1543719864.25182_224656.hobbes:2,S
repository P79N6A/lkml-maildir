The problem is that I cannot use the standard power interface because I don't
know how. The patch in question implements class devices, not regular devices.
Class devices don't use the standard power management scheme. Here:
/sys # ls devices/platform/
detach_state    power           pxa2xx_udc0
mq11xx0         pxa2xx-pcmcia0  pxafb0
mq11xx_udc0     pxa2xx_serial0  pxamci0
None of the above devices implement the backlight and LCD; they use bits from
different devices; in my case several GPIO pins from the mq11xx0 device, a
couple of CPU' GPIO pins (which aren't present in sysfs at all).
Now the mq11xx0 device (which is a System-On-Chip, e.g. a single chip
encomprising a lot of somehow-independent-functions) has a lot of subdevices:
/sys # ls devices/platform/mq11xx0/
detach_state  mq11xx_i2s0   mq11xx_spi0   mq11xx_uhc0
mq11xx_fb0    mq11xx_lcd0   mq11xx_udc0   power
The backlight is controlled by a few spare bits from the mq11xx_spi0 device
(which is a SPI bus controller). I don't think it makes sense to create the
backlight device node under /sys/devices/platform/mq11xx0/mq11xx_spi0/;
besides that's on my PDA; on other PDAs they could be located anywhere else,
thus the software will have a major headache to find the backlight/lcd power
controls.
Right now it works this way:
/sys # ls class/backlight/mq11xx_fb0/
brightness      max_brightness  power
/sys # ls class/lcd/mq11xx_fb0/
contrast      enable        max_contrast  power
I could unify lcd's 'power' and 'enable' attributes into one (they already use
the 'standard' 0-4 power levels), like I stated in one of my previous
messages, but it anyways would be quite different from the current power
management structure.

Doh, you don't want me to fix the whole kernel in one patch, don't you? :-)
