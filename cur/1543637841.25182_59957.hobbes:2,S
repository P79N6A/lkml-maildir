By the way, speaking of /proc/sys, could we decide on either hyphens,
or underscores, but not both?
# ls /proc/sys/vm
bdflush  max_map_count  min-readahead      page-cluster
kswapd   max-readahead  overcommit_memory  pagetable_cache
(this is 2.4.19-rc3)
I'd submit a patch except the asbestos underwear is in the wash
today.  (IOW, I don't know which would be preferred... I suspect
underscores.)
