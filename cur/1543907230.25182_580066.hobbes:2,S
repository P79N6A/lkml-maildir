Ultimately ZONE_MOVABLE can be removed. AFAIK ZONE_MOVABLE is a temporary 
stepping stone to address concerns of about defrag reliability. Somehow 
the stepping stone got into .23 without the real thing.
An additional issue with the current ZONE_MOVABLE in .23 is that the 
tentative association of ZONE_MOVABLE with HIGHMEM also makes use of large 
pages by SLUB not possible.

I'd like to see that patch.

We would still need to check on which nodes which zones area available. 
Zones that are not available on all zones would need to be exempt from 
policies. Maybe one could define an upper boundary of zones that are 
policed? On NUMAQ zones up to ZONE_NORMAL would be under policy. On x86_64 
this may only include ZONE_DMA. A similar thing would occur on ia64 with 
the 4G DMA zone. Maybe policy_zone could become configurable?

Why not for .23? It does not seem to be too much code?

We cannot have a kernel release with broken mempolicy. We either need the 
patch here or the one-zonelist patch for .23.
