Ok,
In 2.5.63bk5 I get a BUG on drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:1557:
        BUG_ON (HWGROUP(drive)->handler);
It now says (copied by hand):
	freeing memory: .....................|
(this 'freeing' takes ages, around 30 seconds, while in progress, the disk
 light blinks every once in a while, perhaps each time while a dot is being
printed)
	syncing disks
	suspending devices
	suspending c0418bcc
	suspending devices
	suspending c0418bcc
	suspending: hda ------------------[ cut here
trace back:
device_susp()
drivers_susp()
do_sofware_susp()
Regards,
bert
