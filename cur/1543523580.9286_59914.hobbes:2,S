That's not i386 is it?
ELF, used by many targets, supports large alignments.  But formats like
COFF and a.out do not, and GCC knows this.
Linux uses larger alignments for some things that should be aligned to a
cache line, either to reduce SMP inter-processor traffic or simply
because it's faster to read fewer cache lines for some critical things.
