On a second thought this doesn't sound unreasonable at all. I
mean we wouldn't want to have the whole friggin' server in the
kernel, but all that down-to-the-chips device support is really
misplaced in a user-land app, isn't it?
I suppose fb shows the way. Maybe something similarly generic
can be found for mouse, keyboard, joystick, you name it. I
believe that ideally no user space application should ever deal
with real hardware (like /dev/port) directly, only with function
oriented abstractions presented via system calls. Not so much
for reasons of compatibility or availability but more for system
security, stability and aesthetics. No one else but the kernel
should be able to lock-up the whole system.
Just my humble opinion,
cheers
Steffen.
