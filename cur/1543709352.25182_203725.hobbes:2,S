Now I know, David Brownell already explained it to me.
It was because make (old)config) asks questions about USB_GADGET,
USB_ETH, USB_FILE_STORAGE, USB_G_SERIAL, USB_ZERO, USB_GADGETFS even on
platforms where no USB peripheral controller is available (like sparc32) -
which make no sense as none of them can be built without any
CONFIG_USB_GADGET_*.
These options could be omitted on such platforms...
