I'll abstain from reviving any of the RTLinux vs. RTAI zombies, none of
those that attended are in any way eager to take those ones out of the
closet, but I would suggest some archive browsing. It is nevertheless,
safe to say that there a lot of differences between these projects, and
that both sides have a very different idea of what these differences are
and what they mean. Great care should be taken not to disturb the dead :)

I've removed the disclaimer in my latest replies, but I stated very
early in this thread that the approaches are not mutually exclusive.
