Not at all.  It's completely standard to have drivers in
linux/drivers/ which may never be enabled for certain platforms.  Or
what's the last time an x86 PC used an Sun SBUS driver?

You seem to fail to realize that I _am_ the ia64 linux tree maintainer.
What does it take for you to believe me?

Good.

timex.h definitely is the wrong place.  If you know of a better place
(other than <asm/pit.h>), I'm all ears.

I have no problem with that.

Can we then agree to just create <asm/pit.h> and be done with it?

Thanks to the new Kbuild, it's very easy: just add a "depends on PIT"
for drivers that depend on the PIT (I think that's primarily ftape and
the drivers/input/misc/{pc,98}spkr.c.
