Ok, makes sense.

Yes, we don't need a struct device and/or struct class_device for it.

Very good analogy.  In this respect I think we should represent
phys, ports, and expanders just as the discover process sees them,
in the same way, as you pointed out, channels are represented
even though the do not quite exist (but are an abstraction).

Is this
/sys/class/scsi_host/host1
Or is it (e.g.),
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.2/host1
?

True.

In which case the flat class/ wouldn't represent phys, ports and expanders
as they do not have struct device/struct class_device; and not directly
controlled by the kernel;  just as "channel".
