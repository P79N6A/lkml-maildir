This is very much by design, and it showed real bugs in programs. You 
can't block a signal and expect the kernel to still honor the signal 
handler you had installed. If you blocked it, you're saying "I'm not ready 
to take this signal". And that means that the kernel should refuse to 
deliver it to you.
Why are you blocking signals that you want to get? Sounds like a bug in 
your program.
