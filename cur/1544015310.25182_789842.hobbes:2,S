Sorry, I may not be following LKML etiquette correctly.  These couple of
recent threads (other than some bugs I found in wait last year) are my
first real attempt to participate here.
I wasn't intending to "change the topic" or dropping the parts about
changing signalfd() to somehow sweet it under the carpet.
Rather than posting repeatedly across the thread, I tried to consolidate
my responses into the other post you've replied to.
You made an interesting point about ppoll here, so I only responded to
that to find out whether the situation of that syscall had been
improved.
Not so much changing the topic, but asking a side-bar question ;)
