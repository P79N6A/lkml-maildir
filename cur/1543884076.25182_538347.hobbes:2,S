        I'm afraid we'd just have ontological argument unless tried to
bring in some references. But wikipedia does agree with you,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System-on-a-chip
 . So, well, down with
redefining SoC then. But "companion" is still too narrow and buzzwordy,
so let's explore Richard Purdie suggestion (in the other mail).
