considering the LVM1 tools interface no longer is supported by DM in
2.6, DM in 2.4 (presumably /with/ LVM1 support (i'd hope)) seems a 
sane way to give 2.4 LVM1 users an easy and reversable upgrade path 
to 2.6.
I know I would love to try out 2.6 on my NFS server, but OTOH, I much
prefer to have access to my data.
