With this patch applied, I keep getting:
NMI Watchdog detected LOCKUP on CPU1, registers:
CPU:    1
EIP:    0010:[<...>]
EFLAGS: 00000002
...
console shuts up ...
at which point I have to hit the reset button.
The EIP, registers, stack, call trace and code are not always the same,
but I can provide an example one if it would help (written down by hand).
However, the EIP is a long way past the end of anything in System.map or
/proc/ksyms, so I don't know how to go about decoding it.
The lockups seem to occur at random, sometimes a few seconds after the box
finishes booting, sometimes not for several hours.
If any more information would help, I'll try to supply it.
Cheers

A debugged program is one for which you have not yet found the conditions
that make it fail.
