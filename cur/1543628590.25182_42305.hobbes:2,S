Hi Dave,
Yup, same thing I was talking about. In technical terms, the thingy that 
marries the processor to the PCI bus. Some SBC's have more than one bus in
front of the PCI bus. Hmmm... I've heard that such marriages are illegal in
Texas. ;-)
Hi Jim,
Any time two unlike buses have a nexus, the nexus hardware has the major 
responsibility to resolve the issues of that nexus, whatever they may be. 
Nothing new here. Ordering of the PCI bus is always the same, as specified
in the spec, regardless of how you get there. ... And it's not always
obvious from the code what is going on in the hardware, especially if it's
_good_ hardware that makes the driver writer's life easier. 
It's all magic ...
Ed
