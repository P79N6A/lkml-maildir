Thanks to those who responded, my Linksys Etherfast LNE 100TX NICs now
works great with Linux and 2.2.13.  I used the latest tulip.c from Don
Becker.  The Linksys drivers which came with the box also worked.  It
appeared from reading list archives and dejanews that this is an FAQ.
I apologise for taking up your time unnecessarily. [I used module+SMP.]
