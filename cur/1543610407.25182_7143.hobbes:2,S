Hmm, I like it.
However, if I didn't missed something again, some corrections are required.
First, in opDEC_check_entIF r16 should be stored on the stack frame
(PAL_rti will restore it). Also, if SRM is broken and doesn't update pc,
we'll jump back to cvttq/svm. So I think we need something like this:
opDEC_check_entIF:				\n\
	ldq $16,8($sp)				\n\
+	stq $16,24($sp)				\n\
+	addq $16,4,$16				\n\
+	stq $16,8($sp)				\n\
	call_pal 63	/* PAL_rti */		\n\
and
		"cvttq/svm $f31, $f31\n\t"
+		"nop\n\t"
		"subq $16, %0, %0"
No?
Ivan.
