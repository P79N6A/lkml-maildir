Hello,
    I have had a hard time determining if /dev/sda is SCSI or SATA
from my boot scripts.  It matters for smartd which needs an added
parameter -d sat in the configuration file for SATA drives.  Finally I
came up with this, but I wonder if there is a better way?  It appears
that
vendor is "ATA     " (5 trailing spaces) for SATA.  If the kernel is
ever fixed to show proper vendor information (Maxtor, Seagate,
whatever) then how can I know if /dev/sda is SCSI or SATA from a bash
script?  When flaming me, please also include the proper solution.
Thanks.
#!  /bin/bash
drive="sda"
vendor=$(</sys/block/${drive}/device/vendor)
if [[ "${vendor}" = "ATA     " ]]
then
  printf "SATA\n"
else
  printf "SCSI\n"
fi
exit 0
