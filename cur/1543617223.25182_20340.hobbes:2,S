Hi All,
I am running 2.5.1 kernel on a 2 AMD processor system and have enable
routing messages, netlink and arpd support inside kernel as described in
arpd docs.
Then after making 36 character devices, when I run arpd, it's starts up
but always keeps silent (strace) and the kernel also does not keep it's
256 arp address limit.
Pls help fix it, I need linux to be able to talk to more than 1024
clients.
Thanks in Advance.
Amit
