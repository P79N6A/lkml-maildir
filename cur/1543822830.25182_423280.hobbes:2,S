I don't think that forcing laptop users to have their own code outside 
the kernel is really the best approach for either the developers or the 
users. Most users will not have the expertise or time to develop 
patches, so teaching the kernel to handle special cases is likely to 
benefit more users and avoid reinventing the wheel.
Having to maintain and out-of-mainline kernel tree is a time-consuming 
job, and even if you can do it you may delay upgrades or build a kernel 
without the added features if they are not required for normal operation.
