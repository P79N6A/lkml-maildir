Even if that were the case I would still use a wrapper.  I am far too
lazy to write __vmalloc(x, GFP_NOFS | __GFP_HIGHMEM); or even
__vmalloc(x, GFP_NOFS | __GFP_HIGHMEM | __GFP_NOFAIL); when I can get
away with ntfs_malloc_nofs{,nofail}()...  (-;
I completely disagree with you given that this is not "inventing [...]
own memory allocators", it is just a convenient short hand.  I am sure a
lot of people would agree with you though.  It is just a matter of
personal preference.
Best regards,
