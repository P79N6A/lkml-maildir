The estimator in 2.6 mainline is nothing like the 2.4 one. Most freshly forked
processes get rapidly elevated to just below fully interactive state in a non
linear fashion and thus are usually much better priority than any running cpu
bound process. Watch top during a kernel compile and starting new apps. You'll
see cpu bound tasks hover between PRI 20 and 25, fully interactive tasks hover
at 15-16 and newly forked processes start around 17. This is intentional as
allowing them to elevate fully to interactive means that disk activity would
fool the cpu scheduler into thinking a cpu bound task is fully interactive, so
they are better than fully cpu bound, but slightly worse than already running
interactive tasks until they declare themselves clearly.
