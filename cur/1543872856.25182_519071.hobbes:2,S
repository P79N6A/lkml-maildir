Not necessarily in such a direct way.
I currently think we are somehow getting neighbours where
neigh->dev points to a loopback device - that's type 772,
and this seems to make sense.
I printed out the device name and sure enough it is "lo".
Is it true that sticking the following
static int ipoib_neigh_setup_dev(struct net_device *dev,
				 struct neigh_parms *parms)
{
	parms->neigh_destructor = ipoib_neigh_destructor;
	return 0;
}
in dev->neigh_setup, as ipoib does, guarantees that neighbour->dev will point to
the current device for any neighbour which ipoib_neigh_destructor gets?
That's the assumption IPoIB makes, and it seems broken in this instance.
How could that be?
