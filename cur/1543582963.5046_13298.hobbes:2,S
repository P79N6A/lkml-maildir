Ok, could you please add a line with "BUG();" after the
printk("__alloc_pages: %d-order allocation failed", ..) in mm/page_alloc.c
function __alloc_pages() ?
This will make you get an oops when an allocation fails and if you decode
it (with ksymoops) we can have a pretty useful backtrace to have more clue
of what's failing.
TIA
