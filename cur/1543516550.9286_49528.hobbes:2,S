Hello,
I have a stock 2.2.13 kernel (+ nfsv3 patch) on a slightly overclocked
Alpha (500 -> 516 MHz). /proc/cpuinfo gives this:
cpu model               : EV56
cpu variation           : 7
cycle frequency [Hz]    : 515463917
BogoMIPS                : 510.65
I run ntpd (4.0.98f) but it fails to adjust the clock; the machine goes
1 second too far into the future every 5 minutes or so. ntpd loses
synchronisation, /etc/ntp.drift is stuck to a depressing 0.000 value.
Is this a known problem ? I had some problems in the past with ntpd,
but it was supposed to be fixed since 2.2.10 or so.
