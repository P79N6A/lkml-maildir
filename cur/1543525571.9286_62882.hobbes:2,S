I see a very similar thing: if I do a "make" of a simple program that
resides on an NFS mounted filesystem, the eepro100 driver reliably
times out.  I'm 100% sure this does not occur with 2.3.42.  Also, ftp
across the eepro100 works fine, so the problem seems to be related to
NFS.
My configuration:
	platform:	IA-64
	kernel:		v2.3.43 (ditto with 2.3.44)
	net driver:	eepro100 (connected via 10bt)
