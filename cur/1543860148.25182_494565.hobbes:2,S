If we find our own binary, we can reexec it.  What we search for isn't zcat, 
it's argv[0], and the search needs to be done in main() before any logic that 
can chdir or set $PATH gets called.  Then save that path until we need it.
The kernel does not currently provide an easy way to do exec ourselves, but we 
can do it ourself.  (And this is a way to do it _without_ proc.)
The problem is, there's no guarante that argv[0] is actually the first 
argument to exec(), it can be any arbitrary string.  (In fact, if tar wants 
to re-exec itself as zcat, we can take advantage of this with 
execv("/blah/tar", ["zcat", "-"]);)  So it's still a hack.  It should work if 
we're called from a shell, but not necessarily from elsewhere.
*shrug*  Kernel support for re-execing ourself would be nice, especially in 
combination with vfork().  If not, I'll figure something out and make it work 
in toybox.  There are a half-dozen non-kernel approaches, all varying degrees 
of hackish.  (And daemonize() can probably be done with clone().)
