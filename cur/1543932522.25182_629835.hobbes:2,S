If I remember correctly how the Kconfig language works, this will allow
for both drivers to be built as modules at the same time. Given that
they have the same name, which one will be loaded by "modprobe
pca9539"? I think that you should instead express the dependency as
"GPIO_PCA9539=n".

Other than that I'm fine with this approach, note however that it will
have to go through David rather than me, as I can't merge this before
the new pca9539 driver.
