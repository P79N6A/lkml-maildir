This is the case where you are sharing input devices across two
independent displays. You scroll your mouse to the left edge it its
appears on the other monitor. You can see this as a mouse/keyboard shared
between two ttys. This would not be the default console behavior.

  No way. To require that would be insane. It's true that only a few apps
will take advantage of this. Under normal use you want to see each head
behave as independent console. The people in each office shouldn't realize
that other people in other offices are using the same machine. Everything
should behave as if the machine was their own. So no you will not have to
rewrite every normal program just to use it on a multihead machine. This
defeats the above purpose. This is the normal default behavior. The only
time a program needs to be aware of multihead is when you want to take
advatange of it.   
P.S
  I'm glad people are starting to discuss this. I like to have more input
from people. 2.5.X will not be not far in the future. So we have to start
thinking about and start molding a form for the new console system.
