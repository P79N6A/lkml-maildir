You're right. But it would be really nice to have a continuous timer 
source in some resolution (microseconds?) available for all platforms
to satisfy synchronization requirements. 
It's not probably required exactly for this example where timing from one
audio target is sufficient, but I can imagine several applications
synchronized together. As far as I know, Linux has not a continous timer.
I am ready to work on this issue. It is very simple to create an interface
with one ioctl returning struct timeval with the absolute timer value
measured from system boot on i386 using rdtsc instruction.
Perhaps, I'm trying to reinvent wheel, so please, let me know, if someone 
solved this issue.
