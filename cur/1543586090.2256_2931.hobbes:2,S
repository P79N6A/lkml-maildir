>Where can I get your driver?
I attach it to the other posting to this thread. I also have it in CVS at
http://linuxconsole.sourceforge.net
 with a bunch of other input drivers.

The reason to use /dev/input/mice is the PS/2 mouse driver itself has not
been ported over to the input suite for 2.4.X. You can use the above for
the USB mouse now. Now if you have a USB mouse plus a PS/2 mouse then
having both use /dev/psaux would require a reworking of the PS/2 driver.
I rather port over the PS/2 mouse to use /dev/input/mice. I have done this
for my CVS but since the PS/2 mouse shares the same chipset as the PS/2
keyboard you have to use both input drivers. It would be better if XFree86
would have a /dev/eventX driver but we would wait a long time for that to
happen :-(
