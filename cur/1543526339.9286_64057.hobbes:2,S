Subject: [OT for kernel grp ]Porting from 4 Processor K - Class HP UX to L inux

I am interested in porting a c++/corba( visibroker ) project that runs on a
4processor HP K-Class processor to a Linux box. The project is written in
ANSI C and I see no problems in porting that.
I have experience at running Linux at home on single processor machines, but
I have never been faced with such a challenge. 
1. Does any one know of such a port before from HP-UX ?
2. What kind of machine should I use to have equal/better results ? Does
LINUX on Intel have the muscle to run such a project ? What distro should I
use ? Should I replace the HP machine with a bunch of pentiums networked to
each other( corba will make the network transparent ) ?
3. Are there any URLs/HOWTOs to look at before I start this project ?
