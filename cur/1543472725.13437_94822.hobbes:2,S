In that case, it might be an idea to clarify that by rewriting the
said text. As I read the document, it implies that a swap file must be
stored in one contiguous block of disk space without any breaks, and
such a requirement certainly makes sense from an effiency point of
view.

So am I, but I'm rather confused about how that will work. According
to the implications in the various messages I've heard on the subject,
if one uses one of the new oversized swap partitions, one can't also
use either the current style of swap partitions or swap files, and I
have to say that such doesnae make any sense to me...
Perhaps you could clarify this ???
Best wishes from Riley.
