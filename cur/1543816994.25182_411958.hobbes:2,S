Hum... maybe Ulrich was answering to my own message (where I stated that most 
existing multithreaded pay the price of context switches)
(To Ulrich : Most existing applications use glibc <= 2.3.6, where 
FUTEX_WAKE_OP is not used yet AFAIK)
I think your analysis is correct Pierre, but you speak of 'task-switches', 
where there is only a spinlock involved :
On UP case : a wake_up_all() wont preempt current thread : it will task-switch 
only when current thread exits kernel mode.
On PREEMPT case : wake_up_all() wont preempt current thread (because current 
thread is holding bh->lock).
On SMP : the awaken thread will spin some time on bh->lock, but not 
task-switch again.
On RT kernel, this might be different of course...
