Ok, I've repro'd this (w/ and w/o NAPI, but w/o is much harder).  I
wasted a bunch of time having both page alloc debugging and slab
debugging on.  Seems one masks the other.  (Jeff warned me!)  In any
case, what I know so far is the problem happens when HW runs out of Rx
resources, and SW tries to resume the receiver after supplying new
resources.  Somehow HW is scribbling on resources already given back to
the OS.  It's something about the list management in this new e100.
eepro100 and legacy e100 work fine.  Investigation continuing...
