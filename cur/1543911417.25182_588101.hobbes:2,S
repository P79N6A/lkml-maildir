> How about one vote per git commit merged to linus' tree?
So you think people who send hundreds of small typo fixes are worth more
than say someone who spends 3 months writing a new driver and gets it in
with one commit ?
Curious....
And very gameable of course. James proposal at least has the advantage of
simplicity, of drawing from a rough set of relevant people (far from
perfectly) and a certain amount of random changeover according to the KS
of the year
I would make only one change personally - extend an email vote to the
people on the final invite list who can't for various reasons make it.
