Sure thing.
I don't have time to look at it today (friends comming over for
dinner), but I should have plenty of time for it tomorrow. So, if you
could send me your patch once you are done for the day, then I'll look
it over and see if I can find anything to add on top of your work (or
have anything to comment on) and bounce it back to you sometime during
tomorrow.
