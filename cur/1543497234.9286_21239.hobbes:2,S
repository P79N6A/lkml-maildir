I was talking about vfat... But I doubt kernel can order stat's in any
way, that can be done in program though. But then the program becomes
optimized for one particular filesystem, which is not good.

I think cyclic search would not do anything at all for ext2 and vfat
(good or bad) on average - that is when order of access does not
correlate with order of directory entries.
Both the cyclic search and search from beginning have their worst
cases and best cases (equal). But ciclic search would speed up certain
common patterns of access, e.g. readdir/stat of ls/find/mc etc.
But for ext2 it is not so critical because it stores directory in a
more effective form so reading it is faster. And soom it will have
b-tree directories that would eliminate the whole problem. So it is
more of a problem for vfat/iso9660 and other ineffective filesystems.
