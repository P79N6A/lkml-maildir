Yes.  You might also be the only one who doesn't see the kernel
release announcements that *ARE* posted here.
I just finished reading the release announcement from Linus for
both 2.2.4 and 2.2.5 on this list, as well as several of the AC
kernel release notes.
Occasionally during 2.1.x I noticed that linus didn't announce,
but under 2.2.x he has.
If you want to keep up on it for sure, then join:
linux-kernel-announce@vger
You get an email with every release...
