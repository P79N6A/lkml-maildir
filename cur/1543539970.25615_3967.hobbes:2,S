I've used the 2.4.0-testX kernels; whenever I run them with Generic PCI DMA Support and SiS support, I get the same errors, and data corruption.  I've had to reinstall Linux 3 times for that reason.  I've tried the IDE patches in the past with no help, but I haven't tried the lastest kernel/IDE patch combination.
Also, if its any help, I have a no-name 48X ATAPI CD-ROM drive on my same channel as a slave; DMA works without errors for it.  The CD-ROM drive only supports UDMA33, however.
