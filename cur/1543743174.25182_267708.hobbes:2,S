It should be enough, but I don't think we want to waste a bitflag for 
something that's only needed for debugging anyway.  They're getting 
precious these days.  Might as well just bloat the kernel some more when 
the alloc debugging is on.
I'll see what I can do to get some backtraces of the __pg_prot(0) &&
page->mapped cases.
