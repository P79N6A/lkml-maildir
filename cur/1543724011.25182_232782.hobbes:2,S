Hi all,
I have recently completed building a LFS (linux from scratch) system 
which uses the 2.6.7 kernel on a i686 machine. Upon reboot the systems 
hangs after the BIOS RAM mapping. Specifically:
-snip-
511MB LOWMEM available
On node 0 totalpages: 131056
	DMA zone: 4096 pages, LIFO batch: 1
	Normal zone: 126960 pages, LIFO batch: 16
	HighMem zone: 0 pages, LIFO batch: 1
and that is as far as it goes unless it takes an inordinate amount of 
time to continue past that point. I did leave it for approximately four 
minutes and had no further progression.
I searched the archives and while I did not find anything pertaining 
this I did see that the next logical progression deals with DMI and 
ACPI so I do not know if it is hanging at the memory portion or the 
next portion.
Any help would be appreciated.
Cheers,
Rob
