Some of the agpgart submissions go along the lines of..
- agpgart complains when I load it.
- running with try_unsupported makes the error go away
- ID of chipset gets added.
In quite a few cases in the past, no, or little actual testing to see
whether the device works correctly, or doesn't corrupt mappings through
the GART.  In some cases, folks actually have thought everything was working
fine, and then later found out they had misconfigured their X setup, and
were running unaccelerated software GL.
These days when recieving ID updates, I usually ask folks
to at least give it a run through testgart to make sure.
It's not the be all and end all of test apps, but it catches the really
stupid cases.

This sounds very odd. How long a delay are we talking here?
It sounds to me like we should be waiting on some other event.
I'll see if I can dig out the 648 datasheet later.
I'd rather not add it to agp_enable. Better would be to add a sis specific
.enable function (which mostly just calls the agp_generic_enable() function
and does the wait), so the other drivers don't need to worry about this.
I'd rather get to the bottom of why the delay is needed though.
