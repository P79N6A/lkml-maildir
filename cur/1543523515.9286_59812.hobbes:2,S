I think this really is the right solution... usually the process doing
this will *be* init.  There are other things that need to be done,
too, like replacing the console fd's after the remount (otherwise you
will hold initrd busy by virtue of having /dev/console open.)
I therefore conclude that doing automatic stuff is pointless and
probably harmful.  The recommended sequence for root-switching will
then look something like (error checking omitted):
	chdir("/oldroot");
	pivot_root("/newroot", "/oldroot");
	chroot(".");
	new_console = open("/dev/console", O_RDWR);
	dup2(new_console, 0);
	dup2(new_console, 1);
	dup2(new_console, 2);
	close(new_console);
	execl("/sbin/init", "init", 0);
