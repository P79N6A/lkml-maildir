Exactly. IMO, it doesn't really help having LABEL= on your ext2 partitions
in /etc/fstab if you cannot also do the same on swap partitions.
My LABEL= patch for mkswap/swapon may not be as sexy as a brand new partition
table format [which arguably is the better solution in the long run], but it
does provide a useful improvement NOW with minimal implementation cost and full
compatibility with existing 2.2/2.4 kernels.

Me too. I can easily add Andries' "swapon -A" to my patch, but I really
don't think that semantics should be the default.
