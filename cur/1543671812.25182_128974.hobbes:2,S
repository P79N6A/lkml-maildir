Yeah, except if you want best code generation you should probably use
	static inline int fls(int x)
	{
		int bit;
		/* Only well-defined for non-zero */
		asm("bsrl %1,%0":"=r" (bit):"rm" (x));
		return x ? bit : 32;
	}
which should generate (assuming you give "-march=xxxx" to tell gcc to use 
cmov):
		movl    $32, %eax
		bsrl %edx,%ecx
		testl   %edx, %edx
		cmovne  %ecx, %eax
which looks pretty optimal.
