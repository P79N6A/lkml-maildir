Hi Nitin,
Thanks much for your response !
Are you really sure that option 2 looks better on a static and heavy 
interrupt load ?
If the load is generated by few heavy sources (sources_count < 
count(cpus)) why not distributed them (mostly) statically across the 
available cpus ? What gain do you have by rotating them round robin in 
this case ?
I think round robin only starts making sense if the number of heavy 
sources is > number of physical cpus.
Kai
