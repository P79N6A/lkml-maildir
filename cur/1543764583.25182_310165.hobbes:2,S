Subject: [PATCH] silence spinlock/rwlock uninitialized break_lock member warnings
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Andrew,
Any chance this patch could be added to -mm (and possibly mainline)?
It removes a bunch of warnings when building with gcc -W, like these:
include/linux/wait.h:82: warning: missing initializer
include/linux/wait.h:82: warning: (near initialization for `(anonymous).break_lock')
include/asm/rwsem.h:88: warning: missing initializer
include/asm/rwsem.h:88: warning: (near initialization for `(anonymous).break_lock')
so there's less to sift through when looking for real problems with this 
patch applied. 
I've been using it for a while with no ill effects.
This patch has surfaced previously, please see the lkml thread 
"[RFC] spinlock_t & rwlock_t break_lock member initialization (patch seeking comments included)"
