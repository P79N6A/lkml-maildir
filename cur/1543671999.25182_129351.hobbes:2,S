It is not a patch to fix the leading "0x" problem. It is a patch to fix 
scanning of hex numbers which do *not* start with "0x". Hex numbers starting 
with "0x" will already scan correctly. Like I said before, try scanning "fe" 
as a hex number, and watch scanf return an error. Like I also said before, 
this same patch has been in 2.5 for quite a while, so I fail to see why it 
shouldn't also be applied to 2.4, unless we are specifically trying to 
maintain different behavior for scanf between the two kernel versions.
