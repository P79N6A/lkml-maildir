I'm running on an Apple TiBook.
With the most recent bk (=2.6.8-rc1) devfs and power management hate
each other.  I was able to get an Oops message once, but sometimes I don't
even get that.
[ I still use devfs because without it, the vt system freaks on boot since
  /dev/console doesn't exist yet, so I don't get any gentoo boot messages
  till the login: prompt ]
Here's what I've could copy down:
