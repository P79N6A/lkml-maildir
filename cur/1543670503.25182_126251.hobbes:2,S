Hmm. You did not forget to rerun LILO or so?
If ide_xlate_1024 does nothing but "return 0" then
handle_ide_mess() does nothing.
What other differences does -ac2 have?
It reintroduces a bug in the partition reading code - the fragment

of the -ac2 patch is bad.
In order to judge whether it is this or something else I would have
to know much more about your system. What are the kernel boot messages
for this disk under 2.5.67-bk9 that works and 2.5.67-ac2 that fails?
What is the partition table? No disk managers in sight? Does LILO
have lba32 or linear options?
Does 2.5.67-ac2 work if you replace its fs/partitions/msdos.c by
the vanilla one?
