When is this code called ?

Again, at which point during suspend is this ?

I do not understand, what you mean. When exactly is "sleeppy test"
running ?
Also the TSC unstable detection is in a 500ms timeframe, so you should
never get a 10s delay.

Why is it too late ? Can you please describe in detail ?

NAK. 
This kills TSC on machines which have a working TSC and never go into
suspend.
