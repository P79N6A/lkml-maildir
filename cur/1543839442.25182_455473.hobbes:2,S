Thanks, but it didn't help me much since it needed some work getting it 
compiling with uClinux-2.4.31-uc0, and the next step of creating a 
functionally equivalent 2.6 kernel doesn't seem to be reasonably 
possible.
My aim is to compare the size of the compiled objects for finding what 
causes size regressions in 2.6 compared to 2.4.
Does anyone have an example with working kernels for both 2.4 and 2.6
and a significantely bigger functionally equivalent 2.6 kernel?
