I dropped into single-user mode and did a fsck to /var.
fsck gave me a lot of errors in style
'unattached inode XXX ' .... 'inode XXX with refcount 2, should be 1'
and later I found in lost+found a some (37) files that used to be in
/var/lib/dpkg/info
Note for that: I use Debian, and Debian's package manager keeps
some files per every package (3-7) in /var/lib/dpkg/info
At the moment 'ls /var/lib/dpkg/info|wc -l' gives 5882.
Yesterday I installed/removed some packages but the files in
lost+found are from _unrelated_ packages, so its even weirder...
Also after fsck the createdb still fails.  It seems to screw up after
trying to create a directory under /var/lib/postgresql/data/base.
Tring to create a dir in e.g. /var/tmp succeeds.
Uh-oh.
