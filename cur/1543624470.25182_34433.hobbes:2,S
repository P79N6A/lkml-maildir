Greetings Dr. von Brand,
One of the issues that has been confused in the stack is the command
parser and/or sequencer.  It is used internally to allow quick and rapid
command additions as needed.  Most are not clear how the IOCTL works and
thinks it runs via the command parser, this is totally wrong.  The sad
part is the lenght of the rope does not hit the feet, it hits the head.
Regards,
Andre Hedrick
