Umm...  Yes and no - open() is not the only thing you can do there.  You
can emulate some of the other stuff with open() + fchdir() + syscall, but...
Note that it also gives you access to other tasks' files (provided that
tasks are yours, so you can get to their /proc/.../fd).

Well - it *does* expose these objects to all normal syscalls.  E.g. you
can unlink() a component in there without
	fd2 = open(".", ...);
	fd3 = openat(fd, ".", ....)
	fchdir(fd3);
	unlink("blah");
	fchdir(fd2);
and similar horrors (now have fun adding locking for multithreaded process,
etc.).
In that sense it is, indeed, the same namespace.

I'm not sure that openat() is the right interface for e.g. fileservers.
And no, I'm not saying that above is suitable for them - IMO neither variant
is what they need.  The thing is, fileserver almost certainly wants to
create and remove objects.  And you either end up with new syscalls for
doing *that* relative to opened fd or you do tons of fchdir(), which
makes benefits of openat() dubious in the best case.
Arguments about O_NOFOLLOW on the intermediate stages are bullshit, IMNSHO -
if they want to make some parts of tree inaccessible, they should simply
mkdir /tmp/FOAD; chmod 0 /tmp/FOAD; mount --bind /tmp/FOAD <blocked path>
in the namespace their daemon is running in.  And forget all that crap
about filtering pathnames and blocking symlinks on intermediate stages
(the latter is obviously worthless without the former since one can simply
substitute the symlink body in the pathname).
