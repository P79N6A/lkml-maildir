No, I don't think the patch is correct.
I don't know how this actually should work, maybe someone who do know can help out
here.
But it look like the idea is, that we have a default execution domain (linux), which
have pers_low = 0 (PER_LINUX) and pers_high = 0.
If one want other execution domains, one much call the register_exec_domain to
register the execution domain and personality.
So if personality is call with a value that isn't register, it then accept the
personality and sets the execution domain to the default settings (which is linux).
So the question is should personality, return -EINVAL, if it got a personality value
which hasn't been registered or should it accept the personality, but set the
execution domain to the default setting ?
If the later is true, should it also accept values outside the values defined in the
personality.h file ?
So what should the following user calls return, if not registered in the kernel?
personality(PER_BSD):
personality(0x47):
Could someone with a better understand than I, please comment this.
