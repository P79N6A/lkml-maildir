You sure?  If I were to do this recommended fix, I would simply add
another patch. One to do the fixes, the other to move the code. That way
it should be trivial for something like git to recognize the code
movement, since the code movement patch would be just that, move code,
nothing else.  The clean up would be a separate change.
