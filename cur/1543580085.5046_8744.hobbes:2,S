It depends on what the performance hit is 'after coding'.  If the code is
say less than 5%
overhead I honestly don't see there being a problem then just to compile it
in the kernel
and keep it active all the time.  Only people who would need it would
compile it in, and
from experience 5% or less for the systems that would be keeping this data
is negligible
considering functionality/statistics gained.
