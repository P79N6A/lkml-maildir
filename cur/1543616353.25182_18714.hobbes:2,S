I was too.  When I have the bounce accounting straightened out,
I'll run each test multiple times.

Clearly I mucked that up.  Thanks for pointing it out.
The patch below makes sense, but I also want to count
"bounced swap IOs" separately.  I'll retest and report that

Is this the only place that kstat (kernel_stat) counters
are not SMP safe...?
