.altinstructions is for alternatives code (code that is rewritten at 
runtime based on some factor such as UP-vs-SMP). .eh_frame has call 
framing information used for unwinding. I think it's copied into the 
vsyscall page (not entirely familiar with this mechanism though).

When you see "Freeing unused kernel memory", the memory between 
__init_begin and __init_end (as marked in vmlinux.ld.S) is released. See 
arch-specific mm/init.c.
