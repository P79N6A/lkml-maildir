Hi,
I posted on my blog a patched version of the nVidia Linux display driver (6111) for kernel > 2.6.9-rc2-bk3. The vanilla one can not compile against current kernel because of the change in the mm (vmalloc and the new __VMALLOC_RESERVE symbol).
I don't know if the patch is clean enough but it works flawless for me, so I think it could help.
Here is the post:
