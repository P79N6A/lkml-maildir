iasl.  The documentation is the ACPI Specification.

I would not expect a -128 on the third position.  The other two -128 are
expected, as they are the thermal sensors for the secondary battery.  There
is also one less sensor than I'd expect.

This must be at least the third complain I come across of a X60 which boils
the CPU.  The standard fix from Lenovo is a planar card swap (motherboard
swap).  Since this *does* mean they replace the thermal compounds, and a
full reassembly of the heat pipes, it might be that just fixing the thermal
coupling between cooling assembly and the CPU might do it.

Well, at least the EC is not misbehaving, then.

More than 4000rpm, in disengaged mode.
