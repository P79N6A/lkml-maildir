	That's quaint...
	The 8.2.4 got some immunity on running out of low fd numbers 
	suitable for stdio at e.g. Solaris.
	(Is there anything else, I haven't checked.)
	Essentially it makes system a bit more resistant against
	(possibly unintentional) denial of service attacks when
	there are heaps and troves of TCP based resolving connections.
	All you need is to have some zone with so massive replies for
	some questions that it does not fit into UDP query/reply packet.
	E.g. have a few dozen different PTR records for some IP address,
	and you will soon see what I mean.
	Run that bind at some saturated load system so that the bind is
	slow as molass, and have lots of people asking for reversers...
	I can pretty much guarantee that you will see what bind 8.2.3
	barfs within a day or so.  Your only solution is to restart the
	8.2.3.  (It fails to act as resolver after the barf until reboot,
	it may also loose one or more of your DNS zones.)
	I haven't checked if 9.1.* series is also immunized for this.
	(That is, if it uses stdio for any file accesses anymore.)
