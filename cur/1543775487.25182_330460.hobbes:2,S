Bug ? We're speaking about bad blocks NOT bugs...
When your hard disk get a bad block you can't keep using it and rely
on the "badblocks-proof filesystem structure that prevents you to do
backups"..even with FAT, the simpler filesystem structure around, if
you keep using you disk you are likely going to loose some data (yes,
maybe not entire files). But, even with the metadata's richer
filesystem, if you detect the first badblock you can save almost
everything.
Does it really makes sense to design a filesystem in a way that gives
users some more time to use their filesystem from the first happened
badblock or it's better to focus on new features that give better
everyday use in terms of performance, functionalities, etc ?
And, are you sure that users who dont do and dont know they have to do
backups of sensitive data are able to recover a corrupted filesystem ?
