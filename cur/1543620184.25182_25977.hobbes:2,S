i am working on an patch which performs power saving on athlon cpu's with
the acpi function of the kernel ... at the moment only via's kt 133/133a
and kt266/266a chipsets are supported, but other will follow soon (amd
760) ...
if you want, you could try my patch.
you can get it under:
http://cip.uni-trier.de/nofftz/linux/amd_cool.diff
it is a patch against the 2.4.17 kernel .
you have to enable acpi-processor idle states in the kernel and you have
to activate the patch at the kernel boot prompt with "amd_disconnect=yes".
this is cause there are several problems known with the power saving
function of the athlon/duron cpus ... i am working on this ....
there is also a newer testing version which reads a special register on
the cpu and shows the value at booting time ... if you have problems with
the patch, or ... better ... if you have no problems with the patch, it
would be verry nice if you could mail me the value it shows at boot :)
the newer version is:
http://cip.uni-trier.de/nofftz/linux/amd_cool_new.diff
there is no big difference between the to versions ... the new version
only reads the register (and ... if you say force_amd_clk=yes at the boot
prompt it modifys the register, but at the moment it is not clear whether
this function does write the right value ... so use this with care ... )
