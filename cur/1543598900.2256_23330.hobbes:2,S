Hmm... I looked through that file, and it only talks about inl and
outl functions.  I guess the 'inpl' from the assembler code can be
mapped to 'inl' from /usr/include/asm/io.h and the same for 'outpl',
but what about 'inplI' and 'outplI' from the assembler code?  My
assembler skills ar zero, so I don't know if i can also just replace
those by 'inl' and 'outl' from the linux source...
Greetzzz,
