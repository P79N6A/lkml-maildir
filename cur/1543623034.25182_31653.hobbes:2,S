I have a somewhat older beast (Fujitsu Stylistic 1000) which is somewhat
older and a little lower spec that I've been playing with a fair bit getting
Xfce + scribble etc running on with no problem.
Generally when you get a crash very early you want to check
	-CPU type the kernel was built with - your oops isnt an illegal
	 instruction so thats not it
	-Disabling APM support
	-Disabling PnpBIOS support (-ac tree only)
	-Using mem=fooM where foo is a bit under what is fitted in case
	 the box lies about memory availability
That generally gets successes. You might also want to do a test boot 
with mem=6M in case the machine has something funky like a 15-16Mb Vesa
local bus magic hole in the address map.
Definitely looks a fun toy
