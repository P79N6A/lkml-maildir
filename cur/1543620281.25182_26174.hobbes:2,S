But surely you *knew*, from inspection, which code paths needed
a spinning lock, and which code paths needed a sleeping lock?
Assuming the answer is "yes" then a nice fix would be to use
two separate locks - one which spins and one which sleeps.
Now, if the resource which is being protected truly cannot
be split up into spin-protected and sleep-protected sections
then a lock which can be atomically converted from spinning to
sleeping at the programmer's discretion seems appropriate.
A dynamic lock which says "we've spun for too long, let's sleep"
seems to be a tradeoff between programmer effort and efficiency,
and a bad one at that.
Possibly the locks could become more adaptive, and could, at
each call site, "learn" the expected spintime.  But it all seems
too baroque to me.
