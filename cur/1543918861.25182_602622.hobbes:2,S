I thought, i was talking about *write() functions, that got one
additional unrelated, non config removable API change in face of
`unsigned int loglevel'.
Idea. Extend those macro defines before format string with one
additional macro, that will be empty, if config is NO and having
colour byte otherwise.
In the *write() functions, have
 color = str[0];
 ++str;
in case if config is YES. And nothing otherwise.
Sorry, i don't know much about stuff, you've presented:

so maybe i just am an ignorant. Anyway this:

have no compile or run time optimization possible.
