You don't have to use /proc/NNN/root - that's just one convenient way
to do it.
Other ways are
    run_in_namespace mount -t bind / /var/namespaces/$NAME
and
    clone + open("/") + pass to parent using unix socket
which I think both work already.

That's correct.

Can you give a reason why sys_chdir() shouldn't have that behaviour?

Or just remove current->namespace.  It's entire purpose seems to be to
prevent namespaces from being first class objects.  The idea of
"current namespace" is adequately represented by
current->fs->mnt_root->mnt_namespace IMHO.
