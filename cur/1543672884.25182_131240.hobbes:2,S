I know, that's why I only listed files in the ia32 directory

I only ask you to change the mask to reflect what the hardware 
allows, not removing the masking, which could have more corner
cases side effects.
Clearing the DAZ bit of every 32 bit program as soon
as it receives a signal can't be right.
