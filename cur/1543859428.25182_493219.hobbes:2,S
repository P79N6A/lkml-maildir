that's a totally wrong attitude - the mainline kernel is /not/ 
experimental. A distro might or might not enable the new option, but we 
just dont enable experimental platform support code via "default y"...
The other problem is that the changelog entry says that it's off by 
default, while in reality the new option switched this code on for my 
box, and broke it.

no, what happened is what i described in my second patch. That 'new 
code' which was default-enabled had a bug which locked up my box.
