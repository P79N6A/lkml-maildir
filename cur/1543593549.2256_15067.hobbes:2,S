It's not an issue of scared or not scared.  It's an issue of what
Linus chooses to allow people to do with his kernel.  This is one of
the main reasons many of us even began to work on the Linux kernel,
because we knew our work could not be compromised in such a way.
And my current understanding is that allowing proprietary
reimplementations of the VM, VFS, and core networking, is not one of
the things which is allowed.
