It is a theory, not a practice. OOM-killer most of time starts from ssh,
database and lighttpd on the tested machines, when it could start in
the reverse order and do not touch ssh at all. Better not from daemon
itself, but its fastcgi spawned processes.

I agree, that there are ways to tune the way oom-killer selects the
victim, and likely after hours of games this subtly will work for the
specified workload. What I propose is the simplest way for the most
commonly used case. It is a help for the admin and not the force to
invent complex machinery which will be error-prone and hard to debug
when eventually oom happens. This will work, but it is way more complex
than what I propose, without immediately visible net effects on other
parts of the originally balanced system.
