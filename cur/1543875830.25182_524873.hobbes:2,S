will try, thanks.

I don't think so as it would mean corruption at other places, too. The
Network is quite uninteresting: single ethernet segment, 2 switches
involved, longest cable 8 meters ...

I _had_ problems with the previous kernel (same version, same config, 
different (older) compiler (gcc 3.4.5 instead of 4.1.2), on both client and server)
It would randomly (usually within 30 mins) 'lock up' NFS, where the client
sends out requests but doesn't get any answer (apart from tcp-ack) from the 
server. Only a forced umount/remount recovered that (until the next lock-up). 
But I'm willing to attribute that to a somehow broken gcc.
again, thanks for commenting.
bye,
Thorsten
