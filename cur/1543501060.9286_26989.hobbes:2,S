   Fortunately for the GPL, the law, at least in the United States,
   doesn't interpret things that way.  If the law worked the way
   you said it does (in that there is no way to remedy a trespass)
   the GPL would have (a) been dragged into court and squashed like
   a bug a long time ago and (b) many many corporations would write
   ``IF WE CATCH YOU WITH GPL CODE, WE WILL FIRE YOU'' into their
   company policies.

   david parsons \bi/ (b) would be fairly bad for Linux.
