Let be clear about one thing: the GKHI make no statement about enabling
proprietary extensions and that's a common misconception. GKHI is intended
to make optional facilities easier to co-install and change. We designed it
for DProbes, and when modularised will remain a GPL opensource offering.
The only motivation for providing GKHI is to make the kernel more
acceptable to the enterprise customer, but allowing, for example, RAS
capabilities to be brough in easily and dynmaically. This type of customer
will not readily succome to on-the-fly kernel rebuilds to diagnose problems
that occur only in complex production environments.
If anything opens the door to proprietary extensions it's the loadable
kernel modules capability or perhaps the loose wording of the GPL which
doesn't catch loadable kernel modules, or whatever... Bottom line GKHI
really has no bearing on this.

*Are you crazy?* =:-0
Proposing proprietary kernel extensions to establish an enterprise
kernel? No thanks!
