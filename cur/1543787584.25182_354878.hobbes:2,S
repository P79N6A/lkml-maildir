There is an easy way to disable the firmware and pretty much all the 
changes that went into 2.6.13: load the starfire with enable_hw_cksum=0. 
If you can easily reproduce this problem, try doing the above and see if 
you can still hit it. Maybe it's a newly introduced problem in the upper 
layer's SG--your other network driver simply isn't using SG so it's 
not affected.
It's very suspicious that the bug would be in skb_checksum_help(), since 
the starfire driver doesn't do anything with the skb before handing it 
over to skb_checksum_help(). It would mean that the upper layer handed an 
invalid skb to the driver, or that we have some random memory corruption 
somewhere.
Thanks,
Ion
