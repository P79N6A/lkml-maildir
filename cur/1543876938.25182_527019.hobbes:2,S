Those are embedded platforms and therefore don't have users who aren't
developers interacting with it as a general-purpose computer.

In other words we're too lame to abstract the hardware properly and
users just have to deal with it...

You probably don't have a powermac or powerbook that has usable,
externally accessible serial ports either.  Plenty of other people do.
It seems Debian has both 8250 and pmac_zilog built in; not sure which
one wins.  Ubuntu has them both as modules and managed to get the
right one (pmac_zilog) loaded on a colleague's powerbook.  You'd know
better than me what FC does.
In any case there definitely are people using pmac_zilog successfully
on powermacs and we need to come up with a way to avoid breaking their
setups.  I'm prepared to accept that the Linux way is to be lame about
serial port naming provided that we avoid breaking existing working
setups.
Paul.
