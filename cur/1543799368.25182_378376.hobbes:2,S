First make sure you have the latest RHEL3 errata kernel installed. If 
that still doesn't work, you could install the latest e1000 driver 
module from Intel.
Later vanilla 2.4 kernels are not necessarily an "upgrade" from Red Hat 
kernels based on older 2.4 versions as you lose all the Red Hat patches 
like NPTL and the O(1) scheduler.
If you are going to go to a 2.6 kernel you might as well just go to a 
newer distribution.
