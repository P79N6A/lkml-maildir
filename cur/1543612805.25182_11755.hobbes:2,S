esr...
   That's correct. Furthermore, those genitives were malformed. :-)
moi...
Oh well. Unix don't need no steenkin genitives. Maybe IBM or somebody
will take them. I hear they do save bundles.

BTW, I'm on
free-as-in-foodstamps-free-this-is-what-freedom-looks-like-Richard
Internet access, my old DC Freenetoid account, and the Maryland library
system's free Lynx service, Sailor. It's on Debian Linux. Log in to the
State of Maryland, login guest, set terminal type to Linux, fancy colors!
Hit d on an ftp link and cLIeNUX's C-kermit and Debian's just find each
other. Unfortunately, it doesn't let you set you editor in Lynx to tcsh
like the freenet account used too :o) So I have to actually visit the
library to update cLIeNUX. Version control, so to speak.
