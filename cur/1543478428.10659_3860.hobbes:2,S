Yes, since I sent that message I speculatively downloaded V3
(24319201.pdf), and upon reading it found info on both the P5 and P6
performance MSRs. Chapter 14 talks about debugging and performance
monitoring, Appendix A lists the perfmon events and Appendix B lists
the MSRs.

It's a P5 thing. For the P6 you use 0x186 and 0x187 for counter 0 and
counter 1, respectively.
Since I have your attention, I'd like to ask another question. Looking
at table A1 I see event# 0x85 (ITLB_MISS), which appears to be
instruction TLB misses. There doesn't seem to be a data TLB miss
event. Am I misinterpreting the 'I' in "ITLB", or does the event I
want not exist?
