Btw. the patch introduces multiple locked pages in pagecache from a single
thread, however there should be no new deadlocks or lock orderings
introduced. They are always aquired because they are new pages, so will all
be released. Visibility from other threads is no different to the case
where multiple pages locked by multiple threads.
