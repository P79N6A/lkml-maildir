It's Marcelo deciding what it's ok and what not.  He's the one
responsible for it.  If you like to give him a friendly advise - fine
with me but I don't think you've got the right to *define* what's ok
and what not for Marcelo.
I've got the impression from these threads about maintaince on lkml
that a number of people try to force something on Marcelo without
giving him a chance to find his own way of doing it.  I trust Marcelo
that he'll do the right thing.
Could we get back to coding and testing?
Andreas
P.S. I trimmed the CC list to only include lkml.
