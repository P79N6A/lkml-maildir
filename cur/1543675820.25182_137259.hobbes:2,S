Test version of supermount for kernel 2.5.70 is available on
http://supermount-ng.sf.net/
Many things are still missing and mediactl interface needs redesign.
It is possiblly completely broken for disks anyway. Still it appears
to work for CD-ROMs and floppies to the same extent as in 2.4 (i.e.
I can easily change media and FAM even gets notified about it :).
More details are in release notes on sourceforge.
It is likely the patch won't apply to previous versions; at least
there were some incompatibilities between 2.5.69 and 2.5.70 already.
Please report bugs on sourceforge tracker.
cheers
