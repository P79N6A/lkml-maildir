Hi all,
Lets make some definitions.
pitch problem (sounds analogue)
- (Wakkos) the sound changes pitch when hard disk is
  accessed.
hack problem (sounds digital)
- the sound drops out for short intervals since the sound
  generating program do not get. Digital effect.
	- time from waking of a higher priority process
	  to it gets CPU to keep the output buffer filled.
	  This can be somewhat avoided by sound application
	  writers by using ridiculous huge output buffers.
	  [ongoing work in this area is described on
		
http://www.gardena.net/benno/linux/audio/
		Ingo Molnar is involved.
		Latest version (N6+) < 5 ms ...
	  ]
	- enough IO to keep the input buffer filled.
	  [you would probably need something like the
	   described in thread "Prioritized IO", but you
	   need to fix the CPU problem first... ]
stuck problem (sounds digital)
- (mine when trying to reproduce the pitch problem) after
  several repeated runs of a process that stress disk write
  the sound gets stuck in some strange output.
 [Working with Alan to find this]
So, where does your fit?
