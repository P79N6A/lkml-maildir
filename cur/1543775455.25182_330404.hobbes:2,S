Well, there's the "unsolvable" writeback deadlock problem, that FUSE
works around by not buffering dirty pages (and not allowing writable
mmap).  Does NFS solve that?  I'm interested :)
Then there's the usual "filesystem recursing into itself" deadlock.
Mounting with 'intr' probably solves this for NFS, but that has
unwanted side effects.  FUSE only allows KILL to interrupt a request.

FUSE is pretty fast.  >100Mbytes/s transfer speeds on a moderate

Memory copies don't seem to be an issue (and FUSE does very little of
it).  Performance is mostly dominated by context switch times (if the
underlying filesystem can keep up).  Unfortunately unbuffered writes
mean a separate request for each written page, and thus a context
switch (on UP at least).  This has a marked effect on write
performance.

Userspace can tell the kernel, how long a dentry should be valid.  I
don't think the NFS protocol provides this. Same holds for the inode
attributes.

OK, I'll do a little research.
