I noticed a curly section of the vm code when I was playing around with some 
hacks that are in the -ck kernel and this section might be helpful as it 
wasn't a hack so much as a fix in mm/vmscan.c around line 600. The problem
is when the priority drops to 1 it should do the most cache reaping but
instead bypasses some of it.
You could try this modification and see if it helps.
This isn't a real patch but you should get the idea.

 	nr_pages -= kmem_cache_reap(gfp_mask);
-	if (nr_pages <= 0)
-		return 0;
+	if (nr_pages < 1)
+		goto shrinkcheck;
 	nr_pages = chunk_size;
 	/* try to keep the active list 2/3 of the size of the cache */
 	ratio = (unsigned long) nr_pages * nr_active_pages / ((nr_inactive_pages + 1) * 2);
 	refill_inactive(ratio);
 
 	nr_pages = shrink_cache(nr_pages, classzone, gfp_mask, priority);
-	if (nr_pages <= 0)
-		return 0;
+	/*
+	 * Will return if nr_pages have been freed unless the
+	 * priority managed to reach 1. If the vm is under this much
+	 * pressure then shrink the d/i/dqcaches regardless. CK 2003
+	 */
+shrinkcheck:
+	if (nr_pages < 1){
+		if (priority > 1)
+			return 0;
+		else
+			nr_pages = 0;
+		}
+
 	shrink_dcache_memory(priority, gfp_mask);
 	shrink_icache_memory(priority, gfp_mask);
