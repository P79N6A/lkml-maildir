No, because loose is also a verb meaning to make loose or
remove restraints.  English is such a fun language.
To lose something implies the loss is unintended, either
real or pretense.  Unless the loss is unintentional you
really shouldn't be using the word "lose".  If it is
unintentional it should probably be past tense (lost).
At this point I cannot be sure of the context here but what
is probably meant would be clearer if we used the word
"discard".
