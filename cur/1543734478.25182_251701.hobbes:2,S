I've not had time to test it but I just posted the code as-is since
thats probably the best way right now

Agreed - it will depend on the card, and on what makes sense for other
reasons. Memory manager code may also need to be part of that. The code
I posted has no provision for "common" module, but just add it to the
list and it'll hopefully DTRT. Providing the DRI and FB drivers
reference symbols in the common module it'll also autoload properly.
Let me know what you think of the code so far (however bad) and I'll try
and get it ticking nicely.
