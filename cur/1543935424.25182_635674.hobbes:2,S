Bullshit.  But first, why don't you post some bootup message logs so
people can actually look at the problem, instead of your space wasting
rant?  Oh wait... I just did waste the time.  Sigh...  
Look at your filesystems, using 'tune2fs' and see if the ext3 journal
is actually turned on and used.  If it's not, then I can see why
you're having problems on reboots.

So go back to 2.4 then, noone is stopping you.  But I'd rather have a

"It's so complex it's for Idiot users" is really funny to read.
