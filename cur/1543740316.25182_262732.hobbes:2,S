Probably deadline/cfq is the best fit, unless your host file is
perfectly laid out on disk in which case you can play with noop. As
Randy already pointed out, you can switch dynamically in the 2.6.9-bk
snapshots - so the best thing for you to do if you want to know for
sure, is to benchmark each of them for your workload. For most things
there should not be a noticable difference between cfq and deadline,
whether as makes a difference (for better or worse) is very work-load
dependent.
