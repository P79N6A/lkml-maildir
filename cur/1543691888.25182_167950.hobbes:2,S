nono...but Intel doesn't have a choice on x86.
They have to optimize for the binaries that are out there.
Compatibility is everything in that market space.
And someone at Intel obviously agrees the newer architectures
should support misaligned access in SW since ever RISC chip
they've built (starting with i860, ~1989) does it that way.

Yeah, I don't use most LAN features (PPPoE, VLAN, Appletalk, etc).
I naively thought there must be a subset everyone uses...but defining
that subset sounds like a rat hole I shouldn't go near.

I'm not totally comfortable with that. The NICs I care about seem to
"bias the buffer address" to compensate for some "common case".
Seems like those cases would be cheaper (and more portable) to add
the get_unaligned() calls in the networking stack....I don't know
though really.
thanks,
