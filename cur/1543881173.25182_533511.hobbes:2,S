Well, actually there is no point making pack files writable.  If they're 
modified, they get corrupted.
Here's the fix I wanted to propose:
diff --git a/builtin-pack-objects.c b/builtin-pack-objects.c
index c72e07a..85c6e6e 100644
--- a/builtin-pack-objects.c
+++ b/builtin-pack-objects.c
@@ -1786,11 +1786,13 @@ int cmd_pack_objects(int argc, const char **argv, const char *prefix)

 			die("unable to rename temporary pack file: %s",

 	}
