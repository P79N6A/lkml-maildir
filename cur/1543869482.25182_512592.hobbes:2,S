And I totally agree with Dmitry. The "% BITS_PER_LONG" doesn't hurt
other users, and it's needed for larger-than-single-long bit arrays.

The complementary LONG() macro will tell you the index of an array of
longs where the bit should be set.

Well, many do not need it, but for example BIT(BTN_LEFT) does, and
that's used in a lot of places.

That would be my only concern - losing compiler warnings.

The 1% will need either LLBIT or an extra % 8.
