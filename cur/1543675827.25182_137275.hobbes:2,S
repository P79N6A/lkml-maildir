Good Morning :)
I tried it out here at work on an 
00:00.0 Host bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 730 Host (rev 02)
I plugged out the usb keyboard (here I have one), put the usb to ps2
adapter on it and used it as an ps2 keyboard (yes, I hotplugged again).
after a couple of minutes the ENTER key "hung" and stopped repeating
after hitting it again.
Here with this mainboard I experienced this behaviour with 2.4.x kernel
series before, though.
At home on i845PE 2.5.70-mm3 triggers this behaviour.
May a XFree86 Bug is triggered? IIRC there was something discovered
which is not fixed yet, I am searching this thing ATM...
