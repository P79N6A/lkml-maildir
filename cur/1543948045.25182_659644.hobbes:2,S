Certainly.  That's why I've been saying that it's not really a simple task to
get rid of the freezer. ;-)

Into Documentation/power/devices.txt, I gather?

But we should not leave a window between releasing dpm_list_mtx and taking
pm_sleep_rwsem.  Either that, or we should make sure that dpm_active is
empty after acquiring pm_sleep_rwsem.

No, they don't, but there are some CPU-related device objects that get
uregistered/registered.  Still, all of this work is really redundant if the CPU
in question comes back up during the resume, so it should be avoided in
general.  The CPU hotplug notifiers should only unregister those objects if
the CPU hasn't gone on line during the resume and they have all information
necessary for discovering that.
