Got the attached panic today when doing a copy between an IDE drive and a
SCSI drive (that had just been mke2fsed). Kernel came from CVS Friday
night.
It doesn't look like it's PPC specific to me, anyone have any ideas?

Options used: -V (default)
              -o /lib/modules/2.2.0-pre5/ (default)
              -k /proc/ksyms (default)
              -l /proc/modules (default)
              -m /usr/src/linux/System.map (default)
              -c 1 (default)
You did not tell me where to find symbol information.  I will assume
that the log matches the kernel and modules that are running right now
and I'll use the default options above for symbol resolution.
If the current kernel and/or modules do not match the log, you can get
more accurate output by telling me the kernel version and where to find
map, modules, ksyms etc.  ksymoops -h explains the options.
No modules in ksyms, skipping objects
