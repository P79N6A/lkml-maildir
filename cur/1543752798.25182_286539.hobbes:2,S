That may well be possible.  I prefer to take a more cautious approach and 
only use _NOFS variants within NTFS, whether it is strictly necessary or 
not.  That way I never need to worry as to whether a deadlock is or isn't 
possible.  The problem simply goes away...

Yes, I remember the thread about the deadlock on page writeback.
I prefer the _NOFS regardless (and others will probably disagree) because 
it also means that if a machine is seriously running out of memory the fs 
will give up with -ENOMEM much more readily with _NOFS rather than 
increasing the memory pressure even further.  As I said, others probably 
disagree with me...
