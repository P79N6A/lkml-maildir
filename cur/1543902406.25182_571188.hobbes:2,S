What if you have two PCI devices sharing an interrupt, unless the host
OS knows about all the devices that can generate that interrupt, how it
is supposed to deal with it?  It can't know that it should pass in IRQ
to a guest OS, unless it can determine which device actually generated
the interrupt, which probably requires some knowledge of the devices
involved.  Should the guest be able to register as a handler of that
interrupt, so that the host has to call the guest's interrupt handler
everytime an interrupt occours that the guest has registered as a
potential handler of?  There might not be any other choice.  Maybe a
driver that simply registers as using the interrupt and then passes the
call to the guest somehow so the guest can determine if the device
generated the interrupt and handle it, and then return back to the main
interrupt handler.  Of course this would mean the guest has to be
scheduled and run during the host's interrupt handler which might just
not be an option.
Sounds tricky.
