Hi,
D-Link DUB-E100 Rev. B USB Ethernet adapters have worked ok in some recent 
kernels - in rc2-mm2, they're broken again; they're detected correctly and 
the asix module is autoloaded, but after "ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.15 netmask 
255.255.255.0", the box becomes unresponsive and keeps repeating
eth0: Failed to enable software MII access
eth0: Failed to enable hardware MII access
eth0: Failed to enable software MII access
eth0: Failed to enable hardware MII access
eth0: Failed to enable software MII access
eth0: Failed to enable hardware MII access
eth0: Failed to enable software MII access
eth0: Failed to enable hardware MII access
eth0: Failed to enable software MII access
eth0: Failed to enable hardware MII access
eth0: Failed to write Medium Mode to 0x0334: ffffff92
This loops infinitely.
Last known working is 2.6.17 with a patch to bring the asix driver up to the 
14-Jun-2006 revision, first known broken is 2.6.19-rc1-mm1. (I'll try to 
figure out what exact change broke it, but this will take forever on this 
hw).
