Subject: [PATCH] BeOS fs support for 2.2.16 update
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is the third in a series to add readonly BeOS fs
support to 2.2.16.  Changes in this version:
o re-enabled functions in debug.c - must edit include/linux/beos_fs.h
  and enable BEOS_DEBUG define to use.  Removed most printk's.
o Beginning of write support.  This does not work, yet.
Notes:  I will release another patch for 2.2.18preX if desired, but
  the only part that fuzzes out is the patching of fs.h, which should
  be easy enough to fix.
        I am in contact with the author of befs and the original author
  of this code, so hopefully write support will happen RSN.
        I plan to continue working to port to 2.4, but am thinking to
  wait until the outcome of write support efforts.
Am I attaching this correctly?
TIA
