I see lots of people sending patches for kdev_t.
In order to possibly avoid duplication of work,
I put my patch at ftp.kernel.org:
2.5.2pre6-kdev_t-diff (415841 bytes)
It has kminor and kmajor, but if that is not desired
a very simple edit on the patch will turn them into
minor and major.
(It is incomplete, but a good start.)
