Anyone who uses the current interfaces should not play with the
inheritable flag, the text I looked at said it was specifically for
execve. Thus if the application doesn't modify the inheritable mask
things will look like it has always done. And it really should not mess
with inheritable mask if it doesn't intend to, that would be a security
bug.
We really should be safe doing this.

I wouldn't call it useless, retaining capabilities across execve +
pam_cap is a very useful thing, on my machine I can give myself a few
capabilities that have always annoyed me (iirc the database that wanted
mlock as regular user would have been solved aswell).
Regarding fs attributes:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0211.0/0171.html
I can see useful scenarios of having the possiblity of capabilities per
inode (it appears the xattr way wins somewhat in the previous
discussion).
Chris, have you seen any capabilities+xattr patches around?
