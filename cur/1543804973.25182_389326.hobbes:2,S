No SuSE kernels here. I started with kernel.org kernel 2.6.15-git7 and
had those problems. Then I tried 2.6.16-rc3-git3, the most recent kernel
at the time of my original writing. As I had some other problems with
that kernel I had a look at the git tree of Linus and applied all sky2 
related
patches to the otherwise unchanged 2.6.15-git7. 2.6.15.1 also was no
solution as sky2 seems to be not available there.

I have to admit that I don´t know enough about the network layers
of the kernel, so here is a list of the network modules loaded (sky2
compiled into the kernel). SuSEFirewall is just standard netfiltering
using those modules.

As said before, rtl8139 does work perfectly well, the same is true
for an identical system with a Via Rhine adapter.
