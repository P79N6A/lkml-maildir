Couldn't we at least warn. Because you will loose irq's if two devices
are sharing an edge triggered irq. If A and B are sharing a edge triggered
IRQ; and both cause a transition, then when A clears it's IRQ the 
shared IRQ will disappear and B's IRQ will be lost.

Driver's need to be able to depend on not losing interrupts.

The problem is that IRQ system doesn't tell the driver the trigger status.
If the driver knew that the IRQ was edge triggered, it could do
the necessary workaround.

The kernel should make the driver writer's problems easier not harder.
