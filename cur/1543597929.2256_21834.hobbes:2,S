Hello..
	I'm trying to compile 2.4.9 on an SX164 board.  I am still
getting a failure on pc_keyb.c  
pc_keyb.c: In function `pckbd_rate':
pc_keyb.c:611: storage size of `old_rep' isn't known
pc_keyb.c:612: sizeof applied to an incomplete type
pc_keyb.c:614: sizeof applied to an incomplete type
pc_keyb.c:615: sizeof applied to an incomplete type
pc_keyb.c:611: warning: unused variable `old_rep'
make[3]: *** [pc_keyb.o] Error 1
Please see my earlier email about the issue on 2.4.9-pre3.  If more
information is needed, please ask.
Thanks.
Donald
