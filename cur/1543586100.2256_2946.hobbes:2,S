Because there are quite valid reasons for "normal" programs (e.g., ld(1)
and other binary-futzing tools) to do so. No, I don't want a paranoic
system where I (regular user) can't do this to my own files using a random
binary editor. An executable is just a normal file in Unix, can't get
around this without seriously breaking lots of stuff.
