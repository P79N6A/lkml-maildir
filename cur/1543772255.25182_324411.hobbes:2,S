Hi everyone
The platform quirk is valid for other PCI-X devices that try to enable 
MSI on that Serverworks chipset. When I submitted the msi quirk patch, 
the bnx2 driver did not have the msi check. I guess it got added. 
Different parts of the organization :(.
However the fact that MSI functionality on the GC_LE is broken could 
potentially cause problems with other devices that try to enable MSI. 
This is the only version of the chipset that the functionality is broken 
on. Other variants have working MSI implementations.
So it would still be useful to have this patch in, would it not?
Thanks
