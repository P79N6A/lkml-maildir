Reiserfs tails
  fs/reiserfs
ext3 with data journalling
  fs/ext3
the journalling flash filesystems
  fs/jffs
  fs/jffs2
NTFS with compression
  fs/ntfs
Some of these are listed in the shred man page.
Multiple overwrites won't protect you from the disk manufacturer
or the NSA. Only one is needed to protect against root & kernel.
So it makes sense to have the filesystem zero the blocks when
they are freed from a file.
