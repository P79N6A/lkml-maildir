I am not sure what the point of that patchset would be in this context 
given that this is about support for arbitrary page sizes. If the 
filesystem wants it then it can reduce the page size for small files.
Different page sizes for one mapping may introduce high complexity into a 
filesystem.
And we can already represent different page size. We have compound pages 
support in the kernel.
page_cache_size(page) in terms of current code in mm is
PAGE_SIZE << compound_order(page)
