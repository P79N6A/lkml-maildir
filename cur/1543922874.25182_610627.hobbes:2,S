In the current code, both vfsmounts are always identical, and so one of
the two should go, agreed.
The thought behind passing both vfsmounts was that they could differ but
point to the same super_block, in which case renames would still be
possible at least from a filesystem point of view. The essential
restriction here is that both files must be on the same device; the vfs
restriction of not allowing cross-mount renames is arbitrary.
Cross-mount renames are not allowed currently, and granted, they may not
be very useful, either.

As always, it's a pleasure to see the genuine Viro charm at play.
