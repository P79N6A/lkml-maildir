Ok, I'm convinced.  Part of the motivation here is to avoid heisenbugs, 
so if people expect volatile atomic_set behavior, I'm inclined to give 
it to them.  I don't really feel like indulging the compiler bug 
paranoiacs, but developer expectations are a legitimate motivation, and 
a major part of why I posted this in the first place.  I'll resubmit the 
patchset with a volatile cast in atomic_set.  Before I do, is there 
anything *else* that desperately needs such a cast?  As far as I can 
tell, all the other functions are implemented with __asm__ __volatile__, 
or with spinlocks that use that under the hood.
