Did you look at the patch?  It uses exactly the same trick that
sound/Makefile uses, just spread out over all the subfiles.  To be
honest, this is where most of the line count reduction comes from.
But you really don't want to have fs/Makefile knowing about the grotty
internals of fs/fat and fs/ext2 and fs/hfs and ...
drivers/ is my next target for de-recursing.. i'm off home now with my
laptop :-)
