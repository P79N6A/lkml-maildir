Does it even need to be a separately visible function?  Could it just be 
part of add_memory()?  Is there any reason delay doing it until 
online_pages()?
That way online_pages() can return to being the one-stop function to 
online all the pages, making mark_pages_online() redundant.

No.  It will always call the GOING_ONLINE notifier, but it will only 
call the ONLINE notifier if it actually bulk-onlines all the pages.  In 
my page-by-page case, it will never end up calling the ONLINE notifier.  
I could call it repeatedly for each page, but I'm not sure how useful 
that is (the lack of any users of the ONLINE notifier makes it hard to 
judge).
