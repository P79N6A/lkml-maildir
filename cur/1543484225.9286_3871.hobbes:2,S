According to my calculations my crash was *impossible*.
The values where high, but well calculated. The real stupid thing is in the
kernel.
I found the problem (in net/core/sock.c,  SNDBUF-ioctl). The crash
occured because the system uses up to 2*sysctl_rmem_max.

                        if (val > sysctl_wmem_max)
                                val = sysctl_wmem_max;
                       sk->sndbuf = max(val*2,2048);
 ---   
rmem_default = wmem_default = 64KB
rmem_max = wmem_max = 1MB
setsockopt(5, SOL_SOCKET, SO_SNDBUF, [1048576], 4) = 0
setsockopt(5, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVBUF, [1048576], 4) = 0
read(5, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 12338976) = 2009568 
I really accept that SO_RCVBUF is a hint.
But I expect that sysctl_rmem_max is a hard limit that I can count on.
Somebody should really fix this or give me a good reason why that thing is
called *max.
Additional to the fix it would be to incrase the default values to 128KB
(because its the actual behavior).
