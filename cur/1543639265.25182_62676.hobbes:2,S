There are some cases where this might not be true - e.g. in the
migration code in at least one version of the O(1) scheduler (included
in RedHat's 2.4.18-4) the migration_lock is taken on one CPU and
released on another (following an IPI being sent from the CPU that took
the lock).
So at the very least you'd need a separate set of spinlock primitives
that don't perform this test, which would have to be used by anyone
taking/releasing such a lock.
