Had a question about the new option in 2.6.28:
[    7.655297] usb 6-2: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
[    7.663280] hub 6-2:1.0: USB hub found
[    7.666533] hub 6-2:1.0: 3 ports detected
[    7.698008] udev: renamed network interface eth0_rename to eth1
[    7.824538]  md1:<6> md0: unknown partition table
[    7.835978] 
[    7.950237] usb 6-2.1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 3
[    8.081335] usb 6-2.1: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
See line:
[    7.824538]  md1:<6> md0: unknown partition table
This is swap, I do not recall seeing this error in kernels < 2.6.28, should
the kernel not scan for partitions on a swap-based parititon? [1]
[2] partitions for mdadm/raid are usually md0_p1 md1_p2 why would it scan for
partitions on /dev/md0, /dev/md1, /dev/md2 as they are 'block devices' e.g.,
similar to /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc
I do have the option checked off:
[*]     Autodetect RAID arrays during kernel boot
As I compile everything in statically, no modules are used.
If I disable that option, would my system still boot/that would get rid of 
the error/so it does not try to scan for partitions on swap?
Justin.
