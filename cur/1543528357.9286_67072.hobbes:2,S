I dont think Linux can boot on more than 8 way system because it programs 
the local APIC in the flat model which has support for only upto 8 local 
apics

hi,
has anybody information about linux attempts on
the new UNISYS ES7000 system?
(it's a 32 processor Intel-machine grouped by smp-"cells"
of four and a "crossbar" connecting the cells.)
they promote it together with M$ for W2k (adjusted version)
but as I read they support SCO as well...
especially interresting to me is that they promote only
NT-benchmarks and no comparision ;-)
