Yeah, I know how to do partial completions.  The increased complexity 
arises in my driver.  It's simply less code in my driver to treat each 
transaction as an "all or none" affair.
For the vastly common case, it's less i-cache and less interrupts to do 
all-or-none.  In the future I'll probably want to put partial 
completions in the error path...

That's why I was thinking out loud, and also why I CC'd Eric :)  We'll 
see.  I'll implement whichever is easier first, which will certainly be 
better than the current sledgehammer limit.  Any improvement over the 
current code will provide dramatic performance increases, and we can 
tune after that...
