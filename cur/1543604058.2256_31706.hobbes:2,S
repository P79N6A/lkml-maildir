well, of course, existing binaries need to be recompiled,
that's what sources are for...
(and because unsigned char is subset of unsigned short, 
often they do not need to be even modified - btw how many
such binaries are there except of consoletools?)

More like complete redesign of console driver would be needed.

Think about someone who wants to use Vietnamese and Slovak
together (or Slovak and Russian as I need. Or Slovak, Lithuanian
and Russian - as one my friend needs. Or French and Hungarian as 
other friend of mine needs. Or any other combination from 
different ISO-8859 worlds). I converted my linux installation
almost completely to using UTF-8, and this (dead keys) was
a full stop, and I could forget about UTF-8.

I do not argue.
