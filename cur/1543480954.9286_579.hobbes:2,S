I found the same Oops and tracked it down. The solution is a missing
#include <linux/version.h> in linux/videodev.h and maybe in 
bttv.h and i2c.h as well.
The Oops is caused when the bttv driver fails to call 
video_register_device() in init_bt848() and therefore never calls
i2c_register_bus(). Then, in release_bttv(), it tries to unregister
the btv->i2c, which contains an uninitialized pointer for its devices.
