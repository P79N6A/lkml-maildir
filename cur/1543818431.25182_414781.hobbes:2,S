This is a very good optimization.  Please don't use a goto here when a
simple if block and some reindenting works just fine.
I would be inclined to restructure the inner loop something like this:
		p = g;
		while (unlikely(p->mm == NULL)) {
			p = next_thread(p);
			if (p == g)
				break;
		}
		if (p->mm == mm) {
			/*
			 * p->sighand can't disappear, but
			 * may be changed by de_thread()
			 */
			lock_task_sighand(p, &flags);
			zap_process(p);
			unlock_task_sighand(p, &flags);
		}
But that is just taste.

I agree that's a sensible thing to be able to rely on (though I don't know
of a practical difference it makes atm).  If this is merged with by
SIGNAL_GROUP_EXEC change, then the invariant is that SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT
always means that all threads (including current) either have pending
SIGKILL or are already calling do_group_exit/do_exit.
Thanks,
