Subject: [Patch:BUG] oversight of copy pgdat array on each node for ia64's memory hotplug.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello.
I found a bug in memory hot-add code for ia64.
IA64's code has copies of pgdat's array on each node to reduce memory
access over crossing node. This array is used by NODE_DATA() macro.
When new node is hot-added, this pgdat's array should be updated and
copied on new node too.
However, I used for_each_online_node() in scatter_node_data() to copy
it. This meant its array is not copied on new node.
Because initialization of structures for new node was halfway,
so online_node_map couldn't be set at this time.
To copy arrays on new node, I changed it to check value of
pgdat_list[] which is source array of copies.
I tested this patch with my Memory Hotadd emulation on Tiger4.
This patch is for 2.6.17-git20.
Please apply.
