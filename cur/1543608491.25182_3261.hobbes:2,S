There is no valuable reasons to remove them in a hurry. But sym version 2
is intended to be a replacement of those both old driver versions. This
has to be proven so prior to removing previous stuff, in my opinion. Note
that Linus may decide differently, but for now he has accepted redundant
drivers in his tree (some seems even to stay here forever:-) ).
