Hi,
I just downloaded something from Netscape (4.61, glibc2) onto a NFS mounted
directory (server: 2.2.13 with gcc 2.95.1, absolutely stable so far).
(client: 2.2.13pre7, Mandrake 6.1 standard setup).
When the download was about half finished, I 'mv'ed the file into another
directory - same NFS filesystem, same partition on server, just a
subdirectory. No problem, I thought, this has always worked on all machines
I know.
Strangely, though, the moved file did not continue to grow. Netscape told
me it was getting 5kb/sec, and eventually finished - but although I synced
several times (on the server) the file did not get bigger and I ended up
with half a download.
No syslog, no debug messages, no nothing. Just a non-growing file.
Now I would like to know what went wrong. =;(
