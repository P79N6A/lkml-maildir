Hi Marcelo, Linus,
The following patch makes directory notifications per thread group instead
of per process tree as they are now.  This means, in particular, that if
a child closes a file descriptor that has a directory open with notifies
enabled, the notification will not be removed.
Thanks to Andrea for the push in the right direction.
Patch against 2.4.19-pre3, but also applies to 2.5.6 with a small offset.
