hi,
I need help.
I have linux kernel 2.4.21 and Cirrus EP9315 motherboard.
I need somehow to enable second memory bank which exists in my motherboard, but Linux doesnt recognize it.
Wchich file should I modify to make Linux kernel able to see all of my memory?
Very thank you for help.
PS:
I cannot enable discontinous memory, because my Cirrus patch doesnt not support it.
