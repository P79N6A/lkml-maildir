Jens, did you get these? Just wondered because it's been almost a month since. 
BTW... just a few more observations:
1. running an OpenGL app like ET and just having some compiling done in the
   background or some light disk io gives distorted sound playback as well as
   very poor OpenGL performance
2. switching between console and xorg also results in short sound distortions
   even though the cpu load is almost zero
Maybe those and the original problem are somehow related.
Thanks...
matthew.
