To be honest, I'm not a fan of it.
If e.g. looking at a Debian kernel source that has 289 different patches 
with names like tty-locking-fixes7 applied, you'll see that this often 
won't give you much valuable information.
You'd need an uniform naming convention for patches across 
distributions, and I don't think such things are worth the effort.
