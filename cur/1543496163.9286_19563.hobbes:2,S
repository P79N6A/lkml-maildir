   But the log-wrap is not the only problem, the other performance problem of
   a real logfs is that we are not going to always read _data_ (not only
   metadata) in the same order we write things to disk... And we are going to
   read _far_ more frequently than writes...
... and one traditional way of dealing with this problem is to assume
that you have a *large* amount of memory, so that most of what you need
to read can be buffered, so that the fact that things are often laid out
in a pessimal order for reading doesn't matter.....
I wouldn't call this a particularly realistic assumption, but then
again memory keeps getting cheaper and cheaper.  :-)
