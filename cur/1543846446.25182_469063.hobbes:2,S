You keep repeating the same nonsense over and over again, lot listening
to anybody who doesn't agree with your position.
If you don't want to have the noexec semantics on a filesystem, remove
it.  Not using the strict (mmap + protect) makes the whole thing
completely meaningless since ld.so can be invoked directly.
If anything breaks for  you, remove the noexec  mount flag.  But don't
argue that because noexec doesn't provide 100% security (which it cannot
alone, of course) it needs not be strict at all.
