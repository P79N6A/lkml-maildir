Well, the secondaries atleast cannot take the local timer interrupt
since things hooked off it, like timers and RCU, are initiliazed
using CPU_UP_PREPARE callouts. I would agree that it is unsafe to
allow *any* interrupt until CPU_UP_PREPARE callouts are completed.
So, the current way of enabling interrupts in secondaries during
delay calibration is unsafe. For that matter, it seems to me
that with no proper mixed CPU support, calibrate_delay() for
secondaries is meaningless.
