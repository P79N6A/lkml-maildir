Hi Alan
Linux 2.4.22-pre6-ac1 doesn't build with the option 
"Old hard disk (MFM/RLL/IDE) driver" (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD_ONLY=y).
This (trivial) patch fixes the problem. Please consider including it in
the next -ac kernel.

I proposed this patch one month ago (Linux 2.4.21-pre8) and though you
approved it on Friday June 13, it has never been included in the 2.4.22
kernels.
