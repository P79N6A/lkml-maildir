OK, now _this_ is undeniably policy, I would go so far as to call it
bullshit.  There is a fundamental technical reason to have closed source
modules taint the kernel, because you cannot debug a closed source
module.  But come on, a BSD license tainting the kernel?  That is
zealotry, pure and simple.
