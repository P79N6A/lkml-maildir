A consequence of getting the incremental-refresh logic right.

It's a difficult balancing act.  A lot of the people asking for color changes
aren't aware of some of the constraints -- one of them being that 12% of the 
male population has red-green color blindness.  Blue turns out to be about the
only color that people with any form of color blindness can recognize.

That's right. Green means "visited or set".

I know.  The basic problem here is that the configurator has to recalculate
visibilities for every item in the new nenu.  I have some ideas for speed-
tuning this.

Yes.  There is at least one more major speedup I may be able to get out
of this.

Whether the authorities be invaders or merely local tyrants, the
effect of such [gun control] laws is to place the individual at the 
mercy of the state, unable to resist.
