the sysctl_bootid is shared with the /proc exposed bootid, so I need to generate it the same way

again.. this is for compatibility with /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id .. the code 10 lines below my patch is identical and does
the %02x stuff... I didn't make that up, I just copied that to get the same output.
I can deviate for cleanup... but I can see some value of being the same format and same data.
