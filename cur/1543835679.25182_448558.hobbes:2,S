If you drop the host_set and tuning patches please drop all the PATA
stuff and my other patches out. I don't have time to field a second
batch of hundreds of "why has my drive stopped working, why is the speed
wrong" emails. 
It'll be easier just to work outside the -mm tree with all this
continued in/out random breakage if people are just going to say "drop
xyz patch" rather than actually specifying *what is actually wrong* and
getting me to fix the merge (Tejun that last one sentence is a hint ;))
