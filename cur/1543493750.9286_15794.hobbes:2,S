I've attached Koles Sandors last email.
He has several messages
"VFS: Close: file count is 0" 
in his message log, but there is no message
"get_unused_fd: slot # not NULL",
I think that we can exclude bad ram:
the system was perfectly stable with 2.0.
the only possible hardware related source
is an AMI Megaraid controller.
I've checked fput()/ fget() calls, and I found the
following problems:
(I don't think that they are related to this crash):
1) binfmt_elf.c: line 819:
do_load_elf_library():

...

possible memory leak: file != NULL, file->f_op == NULL
2) exec,c line 194:
sys_uselib()
>        fput(file).
        if the fget() call about 15 lines above fails,
        then fput() will cause a NULL pointer access.
But I think that the fget() call will never fail.

I'll ask him for his .config file.
The server is a quad processor PPro, many processes,
inode_limit 32000, files_max 8000.
more details attached.
