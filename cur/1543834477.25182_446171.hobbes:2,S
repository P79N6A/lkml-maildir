this gets discussed periodicly, however the performance hit of doing the mapping 
for all core memory accesses is something that the developers have not been 
willing to accept.

experiment, if it's as good as you think it will be post the numbers an you will 
get a lot of attention. quite a few people are working on the memory allocation 
for various things, therea re a lot of useage patterns to balance (and avaid 
pathalogical problems with).
