Hi Jeff, Tjeerd,
I spotted the spin_lock in natsemi.c, and I think it's bogus.
The "simultaneous interrupt entry" is a bug in some 2.0 and 2.1 kernel
(even Alan didn't remember it exactly when I asked him), thus a sane
driver can assume that an interrupt handler is never reentered.
Donald often uses dev->interrupt to hide other races, but I don't see
anything in this driver (tx_timeout and netdev_timer are both trivial)
