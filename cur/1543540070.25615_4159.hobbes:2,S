local_{bh,irq}_count are used from other macros, e.g. in_irq(),
irq_enter(), irq_exit(), hardirq_trylock(), hardirq_enter(),
hardirq_exit(), cpu_bh_disable() etc.  I started to track down where
those macros are called from to make sure that all uses of cpu were
smp_processor_id() or auto variables but it was taking too long.  So I
decided to go for the safe case and define separate macros.  If the
work to track down all uses of cpu is done then the new definitions can
be consolidated, but for now - safety first.

All the old definitions of irq_stat were [NR_CPUS].  But not all
architectures used irq_stat for local_{bh,irq}_count, some used a
single integer for UP and an array of ints for SMP.  Some even used an
integer for UP and moved the counts into struct cpu_data[] for SMP.  So
not all arch's relied on gcc optimization before.

You are right but it will take time to confirm that the generated code
is the same for all uses of irq_stat.  There are quite a few more arch
dependent definitions that can be consolidated like in_irq(), but I
left those for phase 2.  The change was already fairly large and I
wanted to run it past the arch maintainers before spending any more
time on this.
