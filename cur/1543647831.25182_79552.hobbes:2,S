Speaking as the potential user of these tools, having to run a different 
kernel (My translation of exclusive CONFIG) to swich these features on 
and off would be annoying. I would prefer the simple loading/unloading 
of a kernel module to do the job. Having looked at a fair bit of kernel 
module code, I at first think that the kernel module api cannot achieve 
this, but other people on this list might think/know otherwise.
 From the user point of view it is adding/removing a kernel feature so a 
module would seem appropriate, but from a programmers point of view, the 
profiling code would have to be spread about all the kernel code in 
order to accurately catch the profiling information.
Summary: -
Please try to create a profiling kernel runtime loadable module instead 
of an exclusive CONFIG item.
Cheers
James
