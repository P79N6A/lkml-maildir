	Hello Alan ,  something in the < ac10 , breaks the sys/socket.h
	include structure .  Making the below under 2.2.10-vanilla
	compiles like a charm (minus some silly warnings) .  I have
	dug into the sys/socket.h tree of includes & I find SOCK_DGRAM
	defined in asm/socket.h which is included by linux/socket.h
	which in turn is included by sys/socket.h .   But the below
	happens anyway .  Where might I be going wrong ? Tia,  JimL
