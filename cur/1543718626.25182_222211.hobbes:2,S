there really is some sort of problem with 2.6.6 in this area. I have an
app that I am trying to stress test on a dual opteron system and under a
heavy load something goes haywire and the children become zombies. on a
dual athlon the test manages 2500 forks/sec and can continue forever (Ok,
I only tested it to 11M forks at full speed :-), but the dual opteron box
manages 3500 connections/sec for a few thousand connections and then stops
reaping the children. if I attach strace to the parent at this point the
logjam is broken and strace shows the wait calls receiving and handleing
the sigchild
the prarent deals with sigchild by
handler{
while ( wait(...) >0);
signal(SIGCHLD, handler);
}
unfortunantly trying to leave strace attached while running the test slows
it down to ~1200 forks/sec and the problem never forms.
