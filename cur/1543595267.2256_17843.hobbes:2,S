Ah.  I got the above out of a book in the UT library.  (I have the name 
written down in my notebook...  Um, possibly "IBM PS/2, a business 
perspective" by Jim Hoskins, or more likely "IBM RISC 6000, a business 
perspective" also by Jim Hoskins.  I have no idea who Jim Hoskins is.)
Obviously It's better to have somebody who was actually there.  Mind if I bug 
you offline about this?  (Or better yet, convince you to join the mailing 
list I'll be creating this afternoon...)

Cool.  I know there were several nebulous versions of unix available for the 
PC.  (I don't know when coherent was introduced but it was around in 89...  
And Xenix was always sort of floating around...  Considering that IBM also 
had access to Xenix (if it wanted it), that's at least three versions of Unix 
IBM could have put on the PC.
What do you want to bet no two of them ran the same binaries? :)
