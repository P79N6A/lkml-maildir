Sure.  But the specific case we're talking about here is a 300 line
clock driver.  Nothing about its implementation has any effect on the
kernel's APIs or abstractions.

Sysenter is marginally faster than int $80, but not massively so.  I
guess Xen could use sysenter now for hypercalls, since its only useful
for getting into ring 0.

Well, if you have a hypervisor scheduler multiplexing vcpus onto a real
cpu at 100hz and a kernel scheduler multiplexing processes onto a vcpu
at 100hz, then you're going to get a lot of disappointed processes who
nominally got their 10ms real-time slice, but it was all spent on some
other vcpu.   Its important that the kernel's scheduler know how much
vcpu time each process really got, rather than basing its scheduling on
the amount of real time that passed.

What?  That Xen happens to use the tsc as part of its hypervisor
interface?  A fact that's completely isolated from the rest of the
kernel behind the clock subsystem?
