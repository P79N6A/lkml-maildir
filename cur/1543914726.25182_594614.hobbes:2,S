Subject: [PATCH] [Bug 9020] atomic_ops.txt has incorrect, misleading and insufficient information

atomic_ops.txt has incorrect, misleading and insufficient
information about semantics of initializer, atomic_set, atomic_read and atomic_xchg. 
It also incorrectly implies that operations mentioned above are not actual atomic operations.
Included is most of the patch Document non-semantics of atomic_read() and atomic_set() by Chris Snook, 
except the word "assignment".

+value is modified only with the interface operations. atomic_read
+does not guarantee that the runtime initialization by any other
+thread is visible yet, so the user of the interface must take care of
+that with a proper implicit or explicit memory barrier.

+*** WARNING: atomic_read() and atomic_set() DO NOT IMPLY BARRIERS! ***
+
+Some architectures may choose to use the volatile keyword, barriers, or
+inline assembly to guarantee some degree of immediacy for atomic_read()
+and atomic_set().  This is not uniformly guaranteed, and may change in
+the future, so all users of atomic_t should treat atomic_read() and
+atomic_set() as simple C statements that may be reordered or
+optimized away entirely by the compiler or processor, and explicitly
+invoke the appropriate compiler and/or memory barrier for each use case.
+Failure to do so will result in code that may suddenly break when used with
+different architectures or compiler optimizations, or even changes in
+unrelated code which changes how the compiler optimizes the section
+accessing atomic_t variables.
