The method used in INN is to make arg 1 some space. So
  nnrpd -s'                             ' -D ...
You can check that argv[1] is -s, and what its length is, then happily
write over argv[0]. That's portable in practical terms, since most C
implementations just have the variable length args in sequence, while a
few have a fixed length array for args. You're safe in either case.
Ex:
  if (strncmp(argv[1], "-s", 2) && strlen(argv[1]) > REPLACELEN) {
    sprintf(argv[0], "format", atuff...);
  }
Some systems have setproctitle() but it doesn't appear to be posix.
