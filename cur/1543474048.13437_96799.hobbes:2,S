Hello,
2.2.0-pre4 on an alpha (Miata) station.
UFS support built as module. I get the following:
ROOT:$ modprobe ufs
/lib/modules/2.2.0-pre4/fs/ufs.o: unresolved symbol in_group_p
Problem solved by the following patch (dunno if it is the correct
way, though):
--- fs/proc/procfs_syms.c.old	Sun Jan  3 15:07:55 1999
+++ fs/proc/procfs_syms.c	Sun Jan  3 15:08:12 1999
@@ -23,6 +23,7 @@
 EXPORT_SYMBOL(proc_root);
 EXPORT_SYMBOL(proc_root_fs);
 EXPORT_SYMBOL(proc_get_inode);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(in_group_p);
 EXPORT_SYMBOL(proc_dir_inode_operations);
 EXPORT_SYMBOL(proc_net_inode_operations);
 EXPORT_SYMBOL(proc_net);
With this, at least I can insert and remove the module.
By the way, anybody has some mkfs.ufs that would run on a linux station ?
Porting from the *BSD is a bit complicated because there are so many
include files.
