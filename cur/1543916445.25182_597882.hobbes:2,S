A posteriori value, stored in this pointer serves very important role: it
validates returned result. Caller must do this. But if programmer doesn't
know problems (see below), `must' melts down to `may'.
If you take a look at simple_strtoull(), it already doesn't care if this
pointer is NULL or not. (So patch is NULL :)
But take closer look. If it returns `0' (zero), it is not clear if this
zero was parsed or not, unless you can compare `ptr' and `retptr'.
Another case if entire string have no valid number to parse (see
strtol(3)).
This is problem of this particular function, that is copied form
ordinary C. For instance see <
http://bugs.debian.org/431320>.
