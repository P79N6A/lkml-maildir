this is not a problem of KVM - this is a problem of this laptop: its TSC 
stops when going idle. So the TSC is fundamentally unusable for reliable 
timekeeping - and qemu doesnt offer pmtimer emulation to fall back to, 
so the dyntick kernel refused to go high-res under KVM. Once i added the 
hyper clocksource to fall back to, it could utilize the PIT and the 
lapic for clock-events.
