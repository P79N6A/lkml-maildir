Don't apply as-is, it needs to look like the current 2.6.13-rcX two-arg 
version from drivers/scsi/ahci.c:
/* move to PCI layer, integrate w/ MSI stuff */
static void pci_intx(struct pci_dev *pdev, int enable)
{
         u16 pci_command, new;
         pci_read_config_word(pdev, PCI_COMMAND, &pci_command);
         if (enable)
                 new = pci_command & ~PCI_COMMAND_INTX_DISABLE;
         else
                 new = pci_command | PCI_COMMAND_INTX_DISABLE;
         if (new != pci_command)
                 pci_write_config_word(pdev, PCI_COMMAND, pci_command);
}
