I am currently using tvtime 0.9.12-2 from Debian SID on a Linux kernel
version 2.6.6 compiled with Sid's gcc 3.3.3 and haven't seen such
problems so far. I use tvtime often to watch TV on my monitor, and it
works OK, no artifacts and no slowdown (even when I download my email
and spamassassin starts to eat CPU cicles like mad).
With my current configuration tvtime at full screen (1024x768) takes
about 40% CPU from a AMD XP 1477 MHz (1700 rating). I have just tried
launching three copies of "yes" on several aterm's and tvtime still
looks as smooth as before, althoug CPU is always at 100%
Please ask for more information should you need it.
