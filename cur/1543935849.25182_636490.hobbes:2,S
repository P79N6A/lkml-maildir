You are absolutely right.  If we wrote dirty pages to disk, the ctime
and mtime updates must happen no later than msync or close time.
I guess a third possible time (if we want to minimize the number of
updates) would be when natural syncing of the file data to disk, by
other things in the VM, would be about to clear the I_DIRTY_PAGES
flag on the inode.  That way we do not need to remember any special
"we already flushed all dirty data, but we have not updated the mtime
and ctime yet" state.
Does this sound reasonable?
