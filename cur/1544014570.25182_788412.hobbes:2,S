True, You can.  However, anybody you peer with via ntpd will have
issues unless things are coordinated with ntpd (and aren't a leaf
node).  There you have much higher tolerances for correctness.

If you are an ntp leaf node, that doesn't care about UTC accurate to
the second, this will work well.  For most users, this effectively
papers over the problem.
If you do care about UTC time being more accurate than this slewing
will be too large and introduce errors that are too big.  Likewise for
non-leaf ntp nodes.  For these machines, having time be off by 1/2
second can be very bad.  There are many real-time systems that fall
into this category, trading systems on wall street, systems that
control things based on doing things at certain points within UTC
second, etc.  For those types of systems, changing the length of the
second by this much isn't going to work at all.
ntpd also lights the INS bit only on 'leap day' so depending on when
you poll, you might not have a full day's notice of these changes, but
that can be managed...
