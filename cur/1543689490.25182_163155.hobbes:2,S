I had a kernel panic at:
static int kmem_cache_grow (kmem_cache_t * cachep, int flags)
{
        .....
        /*
         * The test for missing atomic flag is performed here, rather
than
         * the more obvious place, simply to reduce the critical path
length
         * in kmem_cache_alloc(). If a caller is seriously mis-behaving
they
         * will eventually be caught here (where it matters).
         */
        if (in_interrupt() && (flags & SLAB_LEVEL_MASK) != SLAB_ATOMIC)
                BUG();
        ...
}
The kernel panics because in the flags variable, I have other flags
(0x1f0) besides SLAB_ATOMIC.
I modified it to:
        if (in_interrupt() && (flags & SLAB_ATOMIC) != SLAB_ATOMIC)
                BUG();
It seems working fine.
Is this good?
