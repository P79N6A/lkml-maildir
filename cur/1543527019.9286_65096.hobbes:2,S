[this is a laptop machine]
I have an odd problem.  In previous 2.3 kernels, I always turned off piix
tuning.  When I compiled 2.3.47-3, I decided to enable it.  I ran the system
for a while and put it into suspend mode.  I brought it out, everything is
fine.
I shutdown the box (powered off).  When I brought it back up, the bios tells
me 'S.M.A.R.T. Capable - Command Failed'.  This is an NEC Versa SX laptop
with a Hitachi DK23AA-12 (12gb drive).  I don't know how to fix this, I'm
not even sure if it was the kernel's fault or not.  Anyone know how to fix
this?
