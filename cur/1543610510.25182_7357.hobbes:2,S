Subject: asm/fcntl.h problem on libc5 with -ansi

The 2.4.x kernels generate a problem when you try to include
<fcntl.h> on a libc5 system and use gcc -ansi to compile it.
The problem is that loff_t is not defined in linux/types.h when
__STRICT_ANSI__ is defined.  struct flock64 is using an loff_t.
Either you should place struct flock64 under ifndef
__STRICT_ANSI__ too, or loff_t not.  I used the later here.
Maybe there are others places that have the same problem too?
