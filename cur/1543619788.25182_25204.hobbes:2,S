Does anything still use this symbol or is it dead?  Quite valid question.

I said that you get false positives because the code that uses the
symbol might not be compiled in your kernel.  The script flags symbols
that are extern or exported and are not used in the current kernel.
Somebody then has to go through the report and decide if those symbols
are required under other config settings or by third party modules,
assuming that they care about third party modules.
The script is NOT an automatic list of what can be cleaned up.  I doubt
that such a list can be generated in the face of the kernel config
system and third party modules.  It is only a starting point for
symbols that need reviewing.
