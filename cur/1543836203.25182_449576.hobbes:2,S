I knew I'd regret digging in the tty code.
Can someone enlighten me as to what this *should* be doing?
int tty_insert_flip_string(struct tty_struct *tty, const unsigned char *chars,
                size_t size)
{   
   	.... 
    /* There is a small chance that we need to split the data over
       several buffers. If this is the case we must loop */
    while (unlikely(size > copied));
    return copied;
}   
Looping I can understand, but forever ?
Given we're not advancing 'copied', can we just kill that while loop?
Or should we be changing it with each iteration?
		Dave
