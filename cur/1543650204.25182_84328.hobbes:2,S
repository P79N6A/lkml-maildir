Thanks. It kills on all our customer's kernel, they don't use the
bleeding edge kernel at all. It is interesting to see vmware
serve as some heavy load stress test tool. It will give some real
world load to the OS, e.g. the load need to boot a windows etc. You
can stack many of them to abuse the OS.

How many instance of bigmm left there? It should be 10 bigmm
