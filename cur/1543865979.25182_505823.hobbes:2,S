I'm happy it's better .. I'm not saying it's worse .

If we change the current "timer" entry to be listed as "lapic-timer" and
not "IO-APIC-edge" (or one of the other names) and replace it with the
count from LOC , that would make sense cause that field already changes
depending if you have a io-apic or not ..
I think the regression (if you can call it that) is not scripts
crashing, but more people not know what's going on with there system ..
