Right.  It's all just "Linux" to me ;-).
(Maybe the kernel SHOULD coordinate it somehow,
 seems like some of the distros are doing a pretty bad job as is.)

Seems things are worse than that.  Seems like it actually kills the
block device before it has successfully (or forcefully) unmounted the
filesystems.  Thus the killing must also be before stopping Samba,
since that's what was (always is) holding the filesystem.
It's indeed a redhat, though - Red Hat Linux release 9 (Shrike).

Ok, so LKML is not appropriate for the init script issue.
Never mind that, I'll just try another distro when time comes.
I'd really like to know what the "Block bitmap for group not in group"
message means (block bitmap is pretty self explanatory, but what's a
group?).
And what will e2fsck do to my dear filesystem if I let it have a go at it?
