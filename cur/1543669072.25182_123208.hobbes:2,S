No. Linux has traditionally used different syscall numbers for different
architectures. The original ports (alpha etc.) always used the syscall numbers
of the "native" Unix, so the numbering was often completely different.
Newer ports who weren't concered about such compatibility often did 
a renumbering too. For example x86-64 has a completely new 
"cache line optimized" ordering.
What should work on most architectures is 
(most = someone told me it doesn't work properly on IA64)
#include </path/to/kernel/source/include/asm-<arch>/unistd.h>
(you need the version in the kernel source because many glibc packagers
in their infinite wisdom use an old outdated copy of asm/ usually from
the last stable kernel only) 
_syscallN(...)
