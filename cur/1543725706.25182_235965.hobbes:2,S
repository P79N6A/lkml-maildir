This may be somewhat of a misunderstanding: You seem to be talking about
a unified framework for performance monitoring -- something I silently
assumed should be the case, while the discussion here was about various
forms of logging -- with performance monitoring being one of them.
So the question is (again, this is an issue that has been raised at the
kernel summit as well): Is there some overlap between those various
frameworks? Or do we really need completely separate frameworks for
logging time stamps (performance), auditing information, etc.?

My postings were motivated by my personal interest in better tracing
and monitoring facilities. However, I'm getting LKCD flashbacks when
reading your arguments. Which doesn't bode well.

DTrace is not a performance monitoring infrastructure, so what's your
point? -- But let's assume for the sake of argument that LTT, dprobes
& Co.  provide something comparable to DTrace, and we just disagree on
what "performance monitoring" means: The chance of getting such a pile
of complexity into mainline are virtually zero (unless it's called ACPI
and required to boot some machines :-/).
So what you can push for inclusion is bound to be a subset, and the
question remains: What does such a subset, which is clearly nothing
like DTrace, offer?
