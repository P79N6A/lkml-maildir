I don't see why not. David objected me removing them I think because
the rwsem code called some from asm (but of course that's removed too).
However AFAIK, this situation should be using the asmlinkage attribute
anyway.
fastcall in kernel is annoying... it seems to imply that we normally
rather slow calls ;)
