Well in the last days I had new design ideas on the VM (I mean
shrink_mmap() and friends). I finished implementing them and the result
looks like impressive under heavy VM load.
I would like if people that runs linux under high VM load would try it out
my new VM code.

If you try it out please feedback...
Thanks!
