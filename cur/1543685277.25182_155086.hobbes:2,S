In nm(1) output, uppercase symbol types means the name is externally 
available, lowercase symbol means it is local.
Even if an object is local, the object file still knows its name (for ELF, 
anyways).  Finding local "static" variables would be very annoying otherwise, 
for porting code to a threaded application :)
