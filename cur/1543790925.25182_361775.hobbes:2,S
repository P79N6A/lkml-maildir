Subject: BUG?: request_irq can apparently sleep

Hi,
the basic question is: Is request_irq allowed to sleep?
A lot of code suggest that sleeping is not allowed, including a
call to kmalloc(..., GFP_ATOMIC) in request_irq itself.
However, we have the following at least theoretically possible call chain:
request_irq->setup_irq->register_handler_proc->proc_mkdir->
->proc_mkdir_mode->proc_create->kmalloc (..., GFP_KERNEL)->BOOM
The code in kernel/fs/proc/generic.c looks like this:
        ent = kmalloc(sizeof(struct proc_dir_entry) + len + 1, GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!ent) goto out;
Given that check for ent != NULL this should probably be changed to an
GFP_ATOMIC allocation. Am I missing something?
   regards   Christian
