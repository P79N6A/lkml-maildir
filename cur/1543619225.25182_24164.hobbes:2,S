I'd rather make the patchbot more intelligent, that means it analyzes the
patch and produces a list of touched files. People can now register to get
notified about patches, which changes areas they are interested in.
In the simplest configuration nothing would change for Linus, but patches
wouldn't get lost and people could be notified if their patch was applied
or if it doesn't apply anymore. Other people have a place to search for
patches and they can check whether something was already fixed.
bye, Roman
