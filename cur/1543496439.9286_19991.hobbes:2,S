Highly unlikely.  Shell scripts can execute entirely arbitrary
programs in addition to builtins, etc..
The usefulness of such a utility would not likely be much due to
various problems one would encounter.  The bottlenecks of
scripts, are mainly between commands, loading full executables
such as grep, ls, awk, sed, etc...
Only a minor speed improvement would likely be there, and likely
unnoticeable.  Perhaps even slower...
If a script needs to be faster, it should be reimplemented in a
compiled language such as C.
