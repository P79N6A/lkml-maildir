/dev/console is probably unsuitable for this (/dev/console is an 
interactive device), but something like /dev/kmsg would probably be a 
good idea -- it can also replace /proc/kmsg.
However, Andrew's sys_syslog() change does what I need, since users are 
used to calling syslog(3) to log messages anyway.
