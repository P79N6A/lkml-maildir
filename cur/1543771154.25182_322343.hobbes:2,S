Ok, I'm glad we're allowed to redefine spin_lock_irq not to do a
hard-irq disable. I'm sorry for the annoyance, but I guess the end
result is even better now than it was before addressing this topic.
So to me the only obvious complain that remains is that every new driver
that calls local_irq_disable is a threat to the worst case latency, and
hence preempt-RT still deserve the "metal hard" definition, since
auditing all drivers calling local_irq_disable is hardly feasible.
