It appears that somewhere in between 2.5.51 and 2.5.52-bk2 (and still in
52-bk4), the kernel no longer pays attention to init=whatever when
booting.
Does anybody else see this?
The bootloader is still passing it
LILO 22.3.3 boot: 2.5.52-bk2 init=/bin/bas
Loading 2.5.52-bk2.......................
<snip>
Kernel command line: BOOT_IMAGE=2.5.52-bk2 root=302 console=ttyS0,9600
console=tty0 init=/bin/bash
but init still loads.
This is single x86, Debian Testing.
