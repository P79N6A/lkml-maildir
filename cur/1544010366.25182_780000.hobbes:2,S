Thanks. Using vmalloc seems worthy of consideration.
I'll try to rewrite and test it to confirm whether it can make the
code simpler and robust enough.
By the way, is there any recommended way to exchange such a large
amount of data items between user space and kernel space?
In the current interface, each data item is copied twice: one is to
the allocated memory from user space (via copy_from_user), and another
is to on-memory structures or to buffers/pages from the allocated
memory.
This looks somehow inefficient.
