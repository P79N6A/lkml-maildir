You can hide the "complexity" of the second line behind
macros.  And this is what is done in most places.
Alternatively, you can use the existing bitops interfaces,
and in that case you define bit numbers only then use the
bitops.h interfaces to do all the work (probably the __set_bit()
et al. non-atomic variants in this case).
Really, I think it's worth it.  I absolutely refuse to put sets of
boolean states into C bitfields or even worse integer members.
Just define a u32 bitmask and be done with it.
