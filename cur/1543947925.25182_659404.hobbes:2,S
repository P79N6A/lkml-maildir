A preemption point is where CONFIG_PREEMPT kicks in task switching
logic; lockdep is different.

Maybe, but I already spent lots more time on this than I wanted.  :(
Another way to address that rm9200 issue would be to just rate
the TC clockevent source lower than the one based on the system
timer, so it's set up but never enabled ... and remember "t2_clk",
calling clk_enable() only when that clockevent device is active.
That would address one half of the suspend/resume equation too,
ensuring that clock is disabled during suspend...
The other half being:  how to clk_disable(t0_clk) during system
suspend?  (And t1_clk on some systems.)  There's currently no
clocksource.set_mode() call; evidently there's an assumption that
such counters cost no power, so they can always be left running.

AT91 chips share identifiers between clocks and interrupts; that's
fundamental, yes?
If some future chip works differently, that's a good time to change
things.  Otherwise I see little point in caring about such issues.
