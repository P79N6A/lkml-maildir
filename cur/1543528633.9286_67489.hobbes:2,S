From what I read it would seem that the only reason to
use spin_lock_irqsave()/spin_lock_irqrestore() is when you don't know
if the piece of code is going to be called from an irq handler or
a sofirq, but doesn't the following piece of code lead to a race condition?
Or at (a) only the lock is released and local irq's still remain disabled?
softirq(){
...
spin_lock_irq(&lock1);
...
spin_lock_irq(&lock2);
...
spin_unlock_irq(&lock2);  <--- (a) enable local irq's?
...
spin_unlock_irq(&lock1);
...
return;
}
