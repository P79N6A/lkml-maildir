No, it means what I have written several times: The UHCI code up to
2.6.17.11 accepted URBs initialized as bulk URBs for interrupt
endpoints, the UHCI code since 2.6.18 doesn't anymore. This is all
somewhat idealized, but these endpoints should be interrupt endpoints
and the driver should initialize its URBs correctly.

In plain English, this means 'I am fairly convinced that the actual
problem is that you are certainly too stupid to read'.

NB: This indicates that the input buffer size (32) is wrong as well.

It doesn't hurt and documents that this is the proverbial impossible
condition check.

It is somewhat unreasonable to expect random people to 'just know'
about things that aren't documented.

I actually thought about that this morning: Considering the path this
came from, this is not 'an odd device' but rather something like 'kernel
memory corruption' (the 'endpoint' value originally came from the
exact same descriptor).
