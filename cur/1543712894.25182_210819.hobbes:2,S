Hmmm. I get lots of truncated IP packets. See attached. I've tried
to help by setting both RCV_BUF and SND_BUF to 1/2 megabytes. Nothing
seems to work except sending only 1436 bytes at a time. That makes
everything miserably slow. 1436 comes from (1500 - 64) 1500 being the
ethernet packet length, 64 being the IP header length.
