Folks thanks to everyone who helped me out with this, I just found the 
file 982235016-gtkrc-429249277 in /tmp
It kept reappearing as it tried to rm * -r in /tmp and
a quick google search led me to find out where it came from.
A few weeks ago i installed a binary that i got from a friends machine, 
and i just checked his machine. It has the trojan also. that explains a 
lot. It was a realserver binary (no longer available for d/l)and i ran 
it once as root as it likes to listen on port 554, before I changed that 
config and set up a user to run it. aggh. so easy to let something slip 
through. never trust binaries... no matter where they come from.
Keith.
