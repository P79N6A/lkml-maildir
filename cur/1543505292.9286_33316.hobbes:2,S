It's just that I've posted some of the same patches before with no
response.  I wrote the support for the new ELSA card sometime in
december and posted it to the isdn4linux list after a while.
But I do apologise, I really ought to know it's the holidays and I was
rather harsh.  Sorry.
Also, in defence of the ISDN maintainers, it is a rather complex beast
and it is probably rather hard to keep the same release schedule as
for the kernel, with the ISDN code goes through the same process of
introducing new features and later ironing the bugs out.
One thing I would like to see though is a stable and an unstable
version of the ISDN code.  Right now there is just one tree for the
2.2 kernels, I'd like to see one tree which only gets bugfixes, no new
features.  Since I have access to some equipment to perform the TBR3
certifications I could volunteer to check that the any changes won't
break the conformance tests.  I don't know if that's enough to keep
the telecos happy but it probably would not be a bad thing to do.
