I'm looking at getting rid of DRM's use of inter_module_xx. DRM makes
use of this to locate and use the AGP module. AGP is an optional
module since some system only have PCI graphics.
Right now DRM uses inter_module_get("AGP") to locate the module if it
exists. It then changes behavior if this call secedes or fails.
If I remove inter_module_get("AGP") and use the symbols directly, such
as agp_backend_acquire(), how do I resolve the symbol link when AGP is
not loaded? If the symbols link as NULL DRM will see that and act
correctly.
