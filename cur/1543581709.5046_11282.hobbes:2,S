SYSLINUX supports up to 57600 (it doesn't support 115200 because it
stores the number in a 16-bit register) but seriously... why the heck
does this matter?  It isn't booting the kernel off the serial line,
you know.  A console at 38400 is really quite sufficient... if you
need something more than that, you probably should be logging in via
the network.
I have toyed a few times about having a simple Ethernet- or UDP-based
console protocol (TCP is too heavyweight, sorry) where a machine would
seek out a console server on the network.  Anyone has any ideas about
it?
