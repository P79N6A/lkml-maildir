Yes, but in practical terms it's probably going to fork a child with
that socket.

My only real insistence in this is that such an interface be called
__try_module_get(), because the "__" warn people that it's a "you'd
better know *exactly* what you are doing", even though the "try" is a
bit of a misnomer.
"module_get" sounds like a "simpler" try_module_get()...
