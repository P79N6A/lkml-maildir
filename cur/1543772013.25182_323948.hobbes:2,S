No logged info, just scrolling heaps junk on screen --> libata 
I could see and I think 8 digit hex in [] on left.  
Hit RESET to reboot, no apparent filesystem damage :)  Sorry so 
little info.  patched 2.6.12-rc6 cleanly  seemed to go stupid 
during mount reiserfs partitions, about that stage of boot.
Being a sucker for punishment, I recompiled with 8KB stacks, highmem 
off (box has 1GB mem) and it go stupid when touch HDD, but USB started 
okay while it stupid, saw USB messages and mouse lit up.
Hit RESET to reboot...  Again, box safely back in 2.6.11.11 land :)
