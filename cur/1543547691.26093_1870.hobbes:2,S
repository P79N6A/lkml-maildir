Believe it or not, but I just saw something similar on test7 while
reading linux-kernel with Mutt. A recent message to linux-kernel from
Daniel Philips got partly zeroed out, and partly tangled up with a
message from the debian-user mailing lists. This message had a very
long From: line. Here's the weird message:
Ah, I'm glad I stumbled on this message because I was just getting
ready to make an argument about why setting ->i_size shouldn't be done
in vmtruncate, at least not before the fs-specific truncate is done. 
OK, I'll summarize here anyway: as it stands, a valuable piece of
information - the previous size of the file - is getting stepped on
just before inode->i_op->truncate(inode) gets called.  This leads to
some messy posturing if you need to know the old size before going to
the new size.
The clean solution would be:
  inode->i_op->truncate(inode, offset);

if there is no /etc/resolv.conf then you can create it.
debian prompts for DNS settings during install but if whoever installed
it did not enter them i imagine it wouldn't create a resolv.conf.
you can (as root) do:
echo "nameserver IP_OF_NAMESERVER" >/etc/resolv.conf
to create a basic resolv.conf
