It's the total weighted load on a run group/queue divided by the 
nr_running for that group/queue.  If this is equal for all groups/queues 
and the total weighted load for them are also equal then the 
distribution of priorities in each group/queue should be similar and 
this will give a high probability that (for an N CPU system) the N 
highest priority tasks will be on different CPUs and hence the highest 
priority task on their CPU.  But these are just tendencies not 
guarantees as it's a statistical process not a deterministic one.

I agree.  Changes to smpnice (as described above) would help with this 
problem (i.e. they'll make the distribution of tasks TEND towards the 
desired state) but would not provide the necessary determinism.  I think 
special measures (such as rt_overload) are required if you want determinism.
