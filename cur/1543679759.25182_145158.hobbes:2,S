That's a fat daddy list of locks you got there.

Increasing user-visible sizes arbitrarily breaks stuff.  Having 
config-dependent types like this increases complexity.
Short term, just sample the stats more rapidly.
Long term, I suppose with 10GbE we should start thinking about this. 
Personally, I would prefer to make the standard net device stats 
available in the format already exported by ETHTOOL_GSTATS -- which I 
note uses u64's for its counters, and it's easily extensible.  I 
received a request for this just today, even.
