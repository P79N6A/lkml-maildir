One other important attribute of a cpuset is that, used properly, cpusets
will guarantee exclusive use of a set of cpus for an application.
MPI jobs are frequently consist of a number of threads that communicate
via message passing interfaces. All threads need to be executing
at the same time. If a single thread loses a cpu, all threads stop making
forward progress and spin at a barrier.
Cpusets can eliminate the need for a gang scheduler.
