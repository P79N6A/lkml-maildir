(as of kernel 2.4.18) pretty much *all* APM functions are disabled on SMP 
kernels--the simple reason being that APM isn't SMP safe, and making it SMP 
safe is not a trivial task.
If all you want is a soft power-off, you're better off using ACPI (assuming 
your system supports it).  Since this is probably a desktop (and not a 
laptop), I doubt there's much else you want in the way of power management...
