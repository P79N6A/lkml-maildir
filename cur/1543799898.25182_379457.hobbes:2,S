Hello, list,
I can catch this with netconsole:
Dec 27 01:58:46 st-0001 ata2: status=0x51 {
Dec 27 01:58:46 st-0001 DriveReady
Dec 27 01:58:46 st-0001 SeekComplete
Dec 27 01:58:46 st-0001 Error
Only this is in log.
After this message, the system hangs, and only reset can help. (no ping,
ssh)
This happened in second time.
kernel: 2.6.14.2
Cheers,
Janos
