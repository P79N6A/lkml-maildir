Hi,
I compiled the linux 2.4.9 kernel with the kdb patch "kdb-v1.8-2.4.9" got
from the "oss.sgi.com" site. I did "make menuconfig" and "make dep" after
which I ran "make bzImage" which stopped with the error message:
/bin/sh: /sbin/kallsyms: No such file or directory
make[1]: *** [kallsyms] Error 126
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/satishj/source/linux-2.4.9'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 2
Please tell me what I should change so that i can compile 2.4.9 kernel
with kdb patch.
Thanks in advance,
Warm regards,
sathish.j
