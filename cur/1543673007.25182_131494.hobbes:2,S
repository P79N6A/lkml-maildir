   but its ok for usb drivers?
Bad ugly code in one area of the kernel is not an excuse
for it in other areas :-)
Really, putting a statement on the same line as the if
test controlling it's execution is very unreadable.  Most
people's eyes expect to see:
	if (test)
		IF_CODE_BLOCK
Whether it be one or more lines.  I cannot count how many locking bugs
escaped for a long time because of utter shit like this:
	if (test) return 0;
