Hey all,
Just thought now might be a good time to mention that I have a few
servers running ReiserFS.  They have NFS'd drives shared across, and
have been up for sometime (they're running Mandrake 7.2).  Now I know
it's Mandrake, and I have no idea what they do to the RieserFS code in
the kernel, so that might be an important note.  Just thought I'd
mention that I have had these servers running for 6+ months :) Also, as
far as hardware, both servers are dual 866 MHz pentiums, with 512 megs
DDR, one with a 15 gig hard drive and the other with a 60 gig drive. 
Hope this information helps :)
