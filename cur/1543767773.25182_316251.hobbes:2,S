 good suggestion...
 been there, tried that [i really _am_ sending to lkml as
 last resort, not first!]
 jiffies equals approx 250? per second?
 baud rate from PIC is determined by GPS - 4800 baud - approx
 600 per second.
 so that'd explain why i only got one character every 3.
 *cold sweat*.  
 i could always use the FIQ, which will be running off the back
 of the Audio DAC/ADC's interrupts, 8khz....
 *shudder*...
