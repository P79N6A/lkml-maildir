I only have a 15.4" laptop screen, but it does 1650 x 1050 -- the
default w/ my Fedora 8 install -- with the nv driver no problem (I
change it because I have normal human eyesight rather than superhero
micro-vision).

Wow, 2 separate demands to a Linux-IDE developer to fix an X driver
for you. Pretty sure that the source is available to you as well.

My own 15 seconds of googling informs me that it's a kernel
command-line option: put it on the command-line as-is.

As I said, I run F8 w/ nv on my amd64 laptop, so I'm not sure what you
mean by the "won't even run X" part there.
