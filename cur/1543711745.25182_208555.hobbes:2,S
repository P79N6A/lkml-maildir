Bah, I don't want to argue here.  I've applied Kronos's patch as is to
my device-2.6 tree which will end up in the next -mm release. 
I'll hold off forwarding this patch to Linus until after 2.6.5 is out,
so that gives everyone a few days in which to argue the name a bunch and
then send me a patch that changes it to the decided apon name (if it is
to be changed.)
thanks,
greg k-h
