Alan, I'm sorry to go back to it, but I have reported something which in my
book is a serious error - a reproducible ext2fs error on 2.2.9. I have
posted several oops tracebacks and (not counting the fact that lmlk is so
overloaded that my posting appeared 48 hours [sic!] after being sent from my
machine) there was no apparent reaction to that post. Well, I'm sure
somebody read that post and somebody is doing something with it, but it'd be
quite nice to know something's going on... Also, the volume of this list is
scary and sometimes it's really hard to find something useful between all
those "me too", "not me" and "how to do this or that, I'm a newbie" mails...
And, once again, the lag on the list is so huge, I sometimes receive the
original post 72 (!!) hours after it's been sent to the list. Oops, sorry, I
went off-topic... But that's a bit frustrating sometimes...
I'd love to be more helpful on the bug I reported, but lamentably, I'm not
very familiar with the VFS and ext2 code in kernel... I suppose others would
spot the bug faster than I would.

And what about repetitive and reproducible crashes on the same machine? I
will gladly make all the crash and hardware details of "my" oopses to anyone
interested - I don't want to send it to public, as they are already in the
lmlk archives.
