Pavel,
SWSusp is mainly useful for desktop users. Although there may be cases
where it is enabled on production machines, it should be aimed at desktop
users as much as possible. The features to toggle reboot and abort suspend
are really, really cool. And combining them with sysrq would just make
them very very ugly. Someone mentioned the Gnome2 disaster, and I can only
second that. Configurability IS important. And it should be easy as well
(/proc is easy enough, good people or distributors can write a script and
provide it to end users, etc.).
To make the abort of swsusp configurable is the best compromise you can
have, IMHO. I don't know why you are so stubborn and don't try to see the
'normal' people (I'm not one of those, but I'm trying to understand!!).
Markus
