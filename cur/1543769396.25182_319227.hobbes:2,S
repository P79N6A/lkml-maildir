The sparse checker does not create files. That means your sparse is
fine. It should locate the stdarg.h

I think I know that it is. There is a "-nostdinc" in the sparse
options, which I saw it in the other email you send out. It
drop the internal include path. Gcc is does the same thing.
gcc -c -nostdinc /tmp/test.c
/tmp/test.c:1:22: no include path in which to find stdarg.h
