Well... _maybe_ documentation/scheduled-removal.txt (or whatever it is 
called) could now be merged into the kconfig options and help text. Or 
maybe not, to keep it easy to track deprecated code.
Well, even if scheduled-removal.txt stays, you could submit a 2nd patch 
putting OBSOLETE and DEPRECATED tags to the Kconfig options listed in 
scheduled-removal.txt, so that kconfig+sched are in sync.
