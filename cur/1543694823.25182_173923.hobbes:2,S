Hello,
i generated modprobe.conf as described. 
when starting x, the intel-agp will not be loaded.
the same with old kernel (2.4.X) and old modutils worked fine.
is here someone, who knows, what i have to change in my modprobe.conf?
i didn't found any samples in the net.
when i start modprobe intel-agp manually, then x runs.

thanks
thomas
