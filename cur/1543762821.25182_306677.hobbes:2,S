Since you don't seem to be willing to remove vserver, I guess you really
need it on this machine, and to be honnest, I too don't see what trouble
it could cause in this area. However, could you try removing the journal,
or simply mount the FS as ext2 ? It would help to narrow the problem down.
To resume, you have your root on ext3 on top of soft raid1 consisting in
two IDE disks, which works in 2.4.21 but not on 2.4.30-rc3, that's
correct ? There was a fix last week by Neil Brown about RAID1 rebuild
process (degraded array of 3 disks, etc...), unless it obviously does
not come from there, you might want to try reverting it first ? The
next one is from Doug Ledford on 2004/09/18 and should only affect SMP.
My different raid machines run either reiserfs or xfs on soft raid5 on
top of scsi and with kernel 2.4.27, so there's not much to compare...
Perhaps someone on the list has a setup similar to yours and could test
the kernel ?
Cheers,
Willy
