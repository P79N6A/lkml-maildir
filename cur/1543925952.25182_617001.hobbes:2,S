To identify your monitoring session be it system-wide (i.e., per-cpu) or per-thread.
file descriptor allows you to use close, read, select, poll and you leverage the
existing file descriptor sharing/inheritance sematics. At the kernel level, a 
descriptor provides all the callback necessary to make sure you clean up the perfmon
session state on exit.

Yes, I know that. Also note that unfortunately, AMD Fam10h IBS feature does not
allow you to capture more than one sample in critical sections. It is still
interrupt based sampling with one entry-deep buffer: one interrupt = one sample.
Perfmon does support NMI though it is much more expensive to use.
