No. ECN is essential to the continued stability of the Internet. Without
probabilistic queuing (i.e. RED) and ECN the Internet will continue to have
retransmit synchronization and once congested stay congested until people get
frustrated and give it up for a little bit.
It's a real issue, and it's actually important to have it implemented. It's
not just a performance hack.
