Disagreement-from:  Jeff Garzik <jgarzik@pobox.com>
The reason why ac97_codec.h is in include/linux is because it provides a 
__public interface__.
Adrian's change
(a) makes it difficult to work on OSS drivers outside sound/oss
(b) increases the pain level of keeping 2.4 and 2.6 drivers in sync -- 
something that I am doing to i810_audio at least.
ac97_codec.h should stay where it is, until OSS drivers are removed from 
the tree.
