Just tried with 2.6.11.10 using ACPI.  On resume, the mouse doesn't
respond (there isn't even a cursor).  If I C-A-Backspace out of X, GDM
needs to be specially HUP'd to restart.  But the mouse still doesn't
work.
This was one of the failure modes in the RHEL 2.6.9-5.0.5 kernel.  (I
know, I know, "ask RH for support", but they don't seem to have any of
the ACPI or APM suspend bugs in their bugzilla anywhere near
resolved.)
