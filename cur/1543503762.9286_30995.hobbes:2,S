Cool, but it caused my Intraserver cards to crash the box :(

So the config options are not different drivers?  Would it be silly to do
something like:
subset for ncr53c[7-8]xx  
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C7xx
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX 
and then a different subset for sym53c[7-8]xx
CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C7xx
CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX 
Or even config xxx53C[7-8]xx then ask if the board is Symbios or other?
Take it easy,
