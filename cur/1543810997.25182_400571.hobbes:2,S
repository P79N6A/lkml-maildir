The mkdump team has accomplished this ...

... so that we do not need to hard-code PHYSICAL_START. The dump capture
kernel is able to run from any memory address the host kernel reserves
for it. The are some limitations though:
- i386: the second kernel has to be loaded in low memory
- x86_64: the second kernel has to be loaded below 1GB (we are working
to move this limit to 4GB)

The mkdump team has been using runtime relocatable kernels for two years
and we are currently working on porting this functionality to kdump. I
was wondering if it would be accepted mainstream.
