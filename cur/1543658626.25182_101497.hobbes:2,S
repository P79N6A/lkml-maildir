Hi Greg - Yes.  The extra whitespace made gcc do the right thing. 
Thanks.
<Bewilderment> Well I learn something new every day </Bewilderment>
I notice, however, that speed with this version of EHCI seems down.
	hdparm -t /dev/discs/disc1/disc
		2.4.21-pre2	2.4.21-pre3
		-----------	-----------
		10.5 MB/s	8.3 MB/s
Either way, this is a great improvement over my previous attempts at
getting USB2.0 running with a Soltek SL75-DRV2 MoBo, which resulted in
