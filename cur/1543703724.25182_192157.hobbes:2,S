Appended, see a snippet of code which worked reliably way back on
the original 2.4 patch.  Maybe you tripped on the precondition?
Or maybe this is just broken so far in 2.6.
A fair amount of usbfs code is at least slightly broken in 2.6;
some usbcore driver model changes are still needed in the area
of this particular ioctl.  (Which got mangled more than most
during its evolution.)  Was this with a 2.6.1 kernel?
I'm thinking this kind of thing ought to be generically doable
with sysfs, maybe with symlink/unlink syscalls between device
and driver nodes.
