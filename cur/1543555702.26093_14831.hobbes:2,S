Yes, throwing out the low bits of mtime so that everybody gets the
same link order for a week. (must be able to reproduce failures)

Ah, but then Linus has an argument to crush you. There is no
reason left to have anything but LINK_FIRST, and so the rest
is redundant and you can just kill the whole idea.
Going with multiple LINK_n entries and nothing else makes it
possible to make order dynamic within any LINK_n group. This
forces eventual discovery of any problems.

The three-partition model is over-engineering, because it adds
extra complexity without getting rid of the fixed-order group.
Instead you get two fixed-order groups and one dynamic-order one.
If we are to leave the current model of a single fixed-order
group, then we ought to switch to something else uniform.
The three groups you desribe just isn't very regular.
