Depends very much on the application. Can be 100% or more. It's actually
probably more of a hit than rewriting something in eg Perl or Python, as
those languages are designed around bounded arrays where in C it's an
afterthought. Oh, and in C, there's the whole issue of pointer aliasing
which means it's only a partial fix.
(C is a stupid language to write large applications in. The vast majority
of bugs in C programs simply don't exist in newer languages. For most of
the things people use computers for today, it's much more important that
something works well than that it work fast.)

Capabilities are a start. But this is an orthogonal problem. If someone
hacks just my account rather than root, to me it's just as bad, no?
