It is, for 2 reasons:
1) unlike __asm, GCC knows how to schedule the instructions in the builtins
2) GCC will handle stuff like ffz (16) at compile time rather than runtime
But, all the builtins are not natively supported on every architecture,
if there is no arch support, it falls back to a libgcc library function,
which the kernel probably wants to avoid.
E.g. popcount on i386, etc.
