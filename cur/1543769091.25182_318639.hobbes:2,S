Its not an arch specific issue. The time sources need to have a field that 
specifies that jitter protection is needed and there needs to be some 
logic to implement it. Otherwise we have to develop special functions for 
each timesource that deal with jitter protection. Function will make a 
fastcall for the clocks that use jitter protection not possible and thus 
timer access will slow down.

Please add jitter protection to the arch independent code.
