= 1. = The kernel mailing list
= 1.1. = How do I get off of this mailing list ???
    Send mail containing "unsubscribe linux-kernel" (without the quote
    marks) in the body of the message (not the subject line) to
    majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu.
    (echo "unsubscribe linux-kernel" | mail majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu)
    If that doesn't work you probably are subscribed using another
    email address than the one you're using now.  In that case the
    first thing to do is to find out the email address you subscribed
    with.  (You're on your own here, but your system adminstrator
    might help you by checking the mail transfer agent's log files)
    When you found out the address use:
    (echo "unsubscribe linux-kernel" "the address you subscribed with"
                                 | mail majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu)
    By the way, a small tip for mailing lists in general: On some
    mailing lists the "unsubscribe <list> <address>" syntax doesn't
    work. In that case use Netscape Navigator to send a mail with
    faked sender address: Enter your "address you subscribed with" in
    Netscape's "Options/Mail and News preferences/Your Email" field,
    fill in your current address in the "Reply-to Address" and send
    the unsubscribe mail from Netscape.  Normally the mailing list
    software will believe the faked "From:" field in the mail.
