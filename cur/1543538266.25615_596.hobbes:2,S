Well, GNU laboratories in Prague are located guess where? In
anti-nuclear bunker 3 floors below terrain. I guess I should reserve a
bed there :-).

PS: I do not think this applies. Software patents are US-only
stupidity.
PPS: If you have something _concrete_, like v.34 implementation has to
violate patent #312413 valid in U.S., China and Iraq; let me
know. Otherwise I guess only reasonable method is to code v.34 and
then see who screams we are violating their patents. (And then send
those to /dev/null. ;-)
