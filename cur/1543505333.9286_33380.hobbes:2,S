Subject: problems with large directories - not only ext2

Linux gets extremely slow on operations like "ls", when done on large
directories (1000+ files). For example, when listing a few large news
directories I can watch how my window manager re-draws its windows, and
typing in commands is awkward (but possible).
Until now I thought this was a limitation of ext2. But just now I ls -lR a cd
with large directories, and the result was just the same. Here is a vmstat
listing:
0 1 0   128  5264 75916 76764   0   0   44    0  143  295   1  41  58
1 0 0   128  5036 76012 76888   0   0   53    0  135  246   0  34  65
0 1 0   128  4812 76080 77040   0   0   41    9  235  361   1  46  53
1 0 0   128  4620 76136 77160   0   0   34    0  447  765   3  38  59
1 0 0   128  4408 76208 77300   0   0   42    0  244  506   2  43  55
1 0 0   128  4248 76248 77412   0   0   29    0  141  231   1  30  68
This is on a dual-cpu system, and as you can see one cpu is about idle the
whole time.
This behaviour, btw, started when the dcache was created, so I suspect
there is a link. I did not think much about it since I thought: "well,
ext2 gets improved since this is a known problem", but it seems that
btrees for ext2 would not improve this problem, as it occurs with isofs as
well.
HTH,
