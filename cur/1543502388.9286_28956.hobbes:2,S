  The packet loss is very small. If I ping -f from Linux to NT the hub gets
overloaded but the NT machine still manages to respond to about 60% of the
packets. But there's no sign of traffic when I initiate the TCP connection
(that can be seen in the tcpdump).

  I have no ideea how to make it work fast. And I forgot to mention, all
Service Packs worked fine *until* I switched on the Linux side from 2.0.37
to 2.2.10.
Andi: I will try your suggestions later when I get into the office. I will
also send you tcpdumps with another Linux 2.2.10 and a win9x
