Remark 1:
/proc/mounts is a semi-misfeature that you need not
worry too much about when you design a change.
No serious programs using /proc/mounts can exist.
We just have "cat /proc/mounts" as a convenient way
to check which filesystems are mounted. Perhaps "df"
will read it.
The idea of /proc/mounts is that it can be a replacement for
/etc/mtab, that is accurate by definition, unlike mtab, which
cannot be updated when it is on a read-only filesystem, and
has other problems. Unfortunately, the code for /proc/mounts
is rather weak. For example, after "mount /dev/foo a", I
find the line "/dev/foo a ext2 rw 0 0" in /proc/mounts
(but "/dev/foo /home/aeb/a ext2 rw 0 0" in /etc/mtab).
Also, mount will escape spaces in directory names, and
use "a\040b", but /proc/mounts doesnt, so that it is impossible
to parse the line "a b c ext2 rw 0 0" in /proc/mounts.
There are further problems.
In other words, an improved /proc/mounts need not mimic the
current one very precisely.
Remark 2:
In a chroot jail one may have a /proc mounted.
Often one prefers not to have things from outside visible there.
Certainly one prefers not to have things from outside accessible there.
Thus, it is a bad idea to introduce paths in the proc filesystem
that are aliases for things outside.
From this point of view /proc/mounts should probably not list
anything that is not visible from the process' current root.
In particular, you avoid inventing notations like 03:03;
if there is no name then the thing is not listed at all.

I think it is unnecessary to make /proc/mount/<kdevname>.
