Dear Mailinglist,
I'm terribly sorry - the arp.c code is *not* buggy, as I was surmising. I
suffered from a faulty configuration file causing to assign a wrong
interrupt to eth0. Thanx to Alan Cox for the fast - and correct - clues
going in the right direction. I'll volunteer to add my stupidity to some
network-faq-file. :-)
