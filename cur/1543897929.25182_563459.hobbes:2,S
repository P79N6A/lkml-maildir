Would you happen to have an opinion on the attached? I don't so much need it 
or anything but I thought about submitting this once when I was working on 
some stuff locally. I didn't since I was expecting arguments that public 
domain is not so much a license, and how it becomes GPL anyway, ...
Stating that code which one intends to be in the public domain has "GPL and 
additional rights" is a bit of a travesty though.
