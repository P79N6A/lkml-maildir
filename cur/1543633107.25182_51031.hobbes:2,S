It may be that there software, livewear, is buggy on SMP systems. Again 
it's cryptic, they do not state if it is the board or only the driver.
Like i said, i've been running windowsXP/linux2.5.20 on a dual athlon 
motherboard (Tyan S2460 before it busted, now i have an Asus A7M-266) 
and both worked fine.  My friend's dual celeron didn't take the sblive

It could also be a power supply issue.  Maby the sound card is the drop
