Subject: [PATCH 6/8] V4L/DVB (4816): Change tuner type for Avermedia A16AR
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: pasky@ucw.cz <pasky@ucw.cz>
This changes it from TDA8290 which is allegedly very unlikely to TD1316 which
is allegedly very likely. I didn't get it to work with either, but expected
that this got applied when Mauro sent it to me, so here it goes again; feel
free to drop it to the floor. :-)
