Or even better, keep the history, and show the diff of the old versus
new in the release announcement, with an appropriate sed 's/+/ /' or
somesuch.
<shrug> I'm sure you all will figure something out. Regardless, my
point is a higher level changelog that is human readable would be
helpful. (There are thousands of per-commit changelog entries to read,
it's beyond what I have the time to do when testing a new kernel).
Also, it seems distributing the release announcement work would be as
helpful as distributing the code development work.
