   LINUX_* - not right stuff. It makes a lot of sence to have the same 
name for same thing, even in different contexts. Or you are going to 
create a hell for some-one who may wish to make a documentation.
   Headers are going to be used in different context (hopefully) so 
would be no collisions (hopefully).
   Another question does GCC have something like C++'s namespace for C?
   That's would be good. Changing names - bad.
   And #define LINUX_NS(x) doesn't make sound - you will lose ability to 
grep over defines and [ce]tags will not work on this anymore. cpp is not
correct tool for namespace implementation.
