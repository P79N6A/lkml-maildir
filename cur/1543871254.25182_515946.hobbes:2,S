And my patch was pretty crack-induced too.  Sorry.
I shouldn't have been thinking about using CONFIG options at all: we
should simply disable the vdso if CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO=y when we
*actually* reserve top memory.
This still need some work (doing that now), but do people like the idea?
The current "vdso_disabled" flag merely disabled the ELF note, so it
needs to be made a little stronger, to not set up the vdso at all.
