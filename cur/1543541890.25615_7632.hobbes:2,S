"cdrecord -scanbus" tries to open /dev/sg0, /dev/sg1 ... 
to see if there is a cdwriter hiding behind one of them. 
Given what you have written above [which can also be seen
by 'cat /proc/scsi/scsi'] cdrecord either couldn't find 
the file names /dev/sg0,1,2 (etc.) or it couldn't find 
the sg driver.
Now if you are running devfs without installing devfsd
with a reasonable /etc/devfsd.conf configuration it is
possible that there are no files named /dev/sg0,1,2 etc.
After running 'cdrecord -scanbus' have a look at
$ cat /proc/devices
Character devices:
  1 mem
  2 pty/m%d
  3 pty/s%d
  4 tts/%d
  5 cua/%d
  7 vcs
 10 misc
 21 sg
128 ptm
....
If a line with "21 sg" ain't there then the sg driver
hasn't been loaded as a module (or wasn't build into the
kernel). If the sg driver is a module and those device
file names are in place then the attempt that cdrecord 
makes to read those device names should load the sg 
module.

Sarcasm born out of frustration?
If you want to see the sg device number to SCSI
device [and pseudo device as in the case of IDE
cdwriters connected to the ide-scsi device] 
mapping try:
$ cat /proc/scsi/sg/device_strs
IBM             DNES-309170W            SA30
PIONEER         DVD-ROM DVD-303         1.10
YAMAHA          CRW4416S                1.0g
To see the sg device number to SCSI host,channel,
id and lun mapping try:
$ cat /proc/scsi/sg/device_hdr /proc/scsi/sg/devices
host    chan    id      lun     type    bopens  qdepth  busy
1       0       0       0       0       4       63      0
2       0       2       0       5       0       4       0
2       0       6       0       5       0       4       0
