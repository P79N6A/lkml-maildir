2.2.15pre4 includes my second chance page replacement trick,
this should reduce the number of page faults a bit and make
it possible to run the same load a bit better.
I'm now running some heavy Java demos (suitably niced) which
bring my 64M box 60M into swap with quite a bit of swap I/O
going on. The system responsiveness is still snappy and my
mp3 hasn't skipped once...
regards,
Rik
