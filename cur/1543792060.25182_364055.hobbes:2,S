That needs to go imho. At least for the common "cpusets compiled in, but not 
used" case. We already have too many locks. Even with cpusets - why
can't you test that generation lockless?

It's also too slow for the common "compiled in but not used" case.
I did a simple patch for that - at least skip all the loops when there
is no cpuset - but it got lost in a disk crash.

why?

Yes, that is their big problem (there is a reason I'm always complaining
about attempts to change mempolicy externally) 
But actually some mempolicy can be already changed outside the task - 
using VMA policy.

Why can't it just test that generation number lockless after testing
if there is a cpuset at all?
