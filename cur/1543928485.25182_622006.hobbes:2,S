Subject: -rt doesn't compile for UML

When writing a big file to a ubd disk, everything in uml slows down to
a crawl, even though CPU usage is minimal.
So I wanted to try the latency tracer from -rt, but it doesn't compile
with UML:
  CC      arch/um/kernel/asm-offsets.s

make[1]: *** [arch/um/kernel/asm-offsets.s] Error 1

Ingo, do you think this route is worthwhile pursuing, or is it too
difficult to make -rt work for UML?
Thanks,
Miklos
