I think it's a cleanup, and yes, I'll take it. Not only does it shrink the 
workqueue thing, I think it's a good thing to make the timer delay option 
explicit, since it's really a totally separate feature.
I obviously didn't see how nasty the conflicts were, and I would want it 
to be not too painful for Andrew. So I could either take it early after 
2.6.19 _or_ after Andrew has merged the bulk of his stuff, depending on 
which way is easier.
I'd actually prefer to take it before -rc1, because I think the previous 
time we did something after -rc1 was a failure (the whole irq argument 
handling thing). It just exposed too many problems too late in the dev 
cycle. I'd rather have the problems be exposed by the time -rc1 rolls out, 
and keep the whole "we've done all major nasty ops by -rc1" thing)
