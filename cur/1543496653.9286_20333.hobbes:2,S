This basically summarises the view expressed in some 70 different
emails I've received in response to that posting, but in my opinion,
they all skirt round the question being asked. I have therefore chosen
to rephrase the question as follows:
 Q> Given a system with the proc filesystem mounted ONCE on the
 Q> /proc directory, and an account chroot'd to /home/ftp (say),
 Q> with no /etc/fstab visible below that chroot point, and also
 Q> no means for a non-root user to create one there, how does a
 Q> non-root user in that chroot trap access files in the /proc
 Q> filesystem?
The original posting that I responded to IMPLIED that a non-root user
in that situation COULD access files in the /proc filesystem, and I
have yet to see a single response that answers that question.
My analysis states that without the /etc/fstab file, no further
filesystems can be mounted, so even if the mount command is present,
the user will not be able to mount any further copies of the proc
filesystem (or any other filesystem) inside the chroot trap, and thus
that such a non-root user has no means to access anything in the proc
filesystem.
Best wishes from Riley.
