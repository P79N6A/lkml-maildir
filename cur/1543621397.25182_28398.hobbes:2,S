Right, friends don't let friends use non-battery back write back caches ;-)

Ok, this is what I was expecting.  The performance improvement from
using the ordered tags on single drives doesn't seem to be very big, and
given the problems with failed requests, I'm thinking about dropping the
scsi parts of the 2.4 barrier patch, and just worrying about making ide 
drives flush things correctly.  The hard stuff on error recovery can
be tackled in 2.5 and (maybe) ported back later.
But, if high end controllers with write back caching see improvements
because they can combine the log writes better with the patch, it might
be worth keeping, but modified in reiserfs so it flushes IDE caches
by default, but only sends ordered tags when the admin mounts 
with -o barrier_ordered or something.
thanks for the info
