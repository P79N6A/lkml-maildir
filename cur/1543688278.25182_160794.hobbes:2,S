The transfer frame in your reference specified, contains all
the information necessary for the protocol, even if it's stupid
to use that protocol on a RS-232C link. Nevertheless, there is
a minimim size for the header (5 octets in length). There is
also the 3 octets used for sync, which I'm pretty sure will
not be put onto the RS-232C links. Anyway, you need to read
40 bytes (always), from that, you will learn the length
of the rest of the data. So you use poll()/read() until you
get that header information. Then you will know what the
total read-length should be.
Cheers,
