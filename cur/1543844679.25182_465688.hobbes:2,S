With your alloc_pages_range this check can go away.  I think only the dev 
== NULL check is needed with this scheme since it looks like there's no 
way (currently) for ISA devices to store their masks for later 
consultation by arch code?

There's max_pfn, but on machines with large memory holes using it might not 
help much.
