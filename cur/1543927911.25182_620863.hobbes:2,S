Subject: Linux 2.6.24-rc* regression: sensors says "No sensors found"

I just booted 2.6.24-rc3 on two different PCs, one with i945 based MSI
motherboard and i386 kernel and one with i945 based Apple motherboard
and x86-64 kernel.  Before that I ran linux 2.6.23.
On both PCs, "sensors" exits with
> No sensors found!
> Make sure you loaded all the kernel drivers you need.
> Try sensors-detect to find out which these are.
Modules loaded on the i386, among others:
coretemp, w83627ehf, hwmon_vid, hwmon
Modules loaded on the x86-64, among others:
i2c_dev, applesmc, led_class, input_polldev, coretemp, hwmon, eeprom
The configuration scripts are the same as I used them under 2.6.23.
sensors-detect doesn't come up with anything which I didn't know and had
configured already.  On both PCs:
$ sensors -v
sensors version 2.10.4 with libsensors version 2.10.4
