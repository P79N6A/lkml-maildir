My pleasure; thanks for considering my comments.

Yes, sorry for the confusion; I meant the #defines. :)

Yeah, I'm not a fan of if (foo) return 1 else return 0; perhaps I'm in
the minority, but I'd feel better if the choice of these two styles were
made consciously:
static int is_isec_defined(struct slm_isec_data *isec)
{
	if (isec && isec->level.iac_level != SLM_IAC_NOTDEFINED)
		return 1;
	return 0;
}
static int is_isec_defined(struct slm_isec_data *isec)
{
	return isec && (isec->level.iac_level != SLM_IAC_NOTDEFINED);
}
If you find the first easier to work with, then feel free to keep it.

Is there any danger of another task sharing the mm structure to
repopulate the cache before your changes are incorporated?

Ah, yes, separating integrity status from error returns makes sense; I
hope the functions can be made to read as clearly as your description.

CAP_SYS_MODULE, CAP_SYS_PTRACE, CAP_SYS_RAWIO, come to mind immediately. :)

Makes sense; but should an UNTRUSTED process really have the ability to
ptrace a kernel thread? (Ok, on my tests I wasn't able to strace attach
to kernel threads, but I'm not positive that it can't be done.)
Thanks Kylene
