Now I know this is a concious decision, but recent zlib allows you to write
out gzip content, at a cost of 14 bytes I think per file, by adding 32 to
the window size. This in turn would allow users to zcat your objects at
ease.
You get confirmation of completeness of the file for free, as gzip encodes
the length of the file at the end.
Perhaps something to consider.
