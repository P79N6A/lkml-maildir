Good listers,
	Firstly apologies if this is not the most correct list to send to.
Secondly please explain things simply..I'm a newbie
	I recently recompiled my Kernel (RH 6.0, 2.2.11) and had some
questions I would like to ask.
	When I rebooted I got message(s) similar to the following :
	Starting lpd : Warning: /boot/System.map has an incorrect Kernel
version.
	Q1) exactly what does this mean ?
	Q2) I thought that when I did a make bzImage (or possibly during the
make modules_install ?) that a copy of the new system/map would
automatically be put in /boot.  I vi'ed the Makefile and noticed that the
system.map section had a comment like "uncomment this bit if you want to put
the Sysem.map anywhere other than root".  Shouldn't the default directory be
boot ?.  Should I modify the Makefile to always point at /boot ?
	Q3) I cp'ed the System.map file from /usr/src/linux to the boot
directory and that fixed the problem (but has raised a few other questions)
was this a wise think to do ?.  If not, what should I have done ?.
	Q4) System.map _was_ a link to System.map-2.2.5-22 (the previous
kernel) but I also notice that there still is a System.map-2.2.55-22Boot and
System.map-2.2.55-22smp.   I didn't update these files (do I need to ?,
where do I find the 'correct' files ?).  
	Q5) What does System.map-2.2.55-22Boot and System.map-2.2.55-22smp
actually do ?.  I read the HOWTO several times and there is no mention of
these two files.
	Q6) is there a HOWTO or other suggested reading that would answer my
questions ?
	I'm sure that answering these questions will lead to others so
thanks in advance.
	And I apologies if this mail is not in 'text' format.  I have tried
to force Windoze to send it text, but being a M$ product, who knows how it
will _really_ behave.
	Lastly, as I am not subscribed to this list please respond to me
personally (pclyne@csr.com.au) as well as the list (who knows, possibly
someone else wants to know this information).
