   I agree it is possible, I disagree that it should be nessasary. For
   E-commerce sites you will find that the number of cgi's can end up much
   larget than you would expect from normal web site statistics. I will let
   this drop now as it appears that this is not going to be an option.
Perl CGI's aren't exectables, and get executed by mod_perl.  If you have
real CGI progams which are written in C, then sure --- but usually most
web machines don't have that many custom CGI programs written in C.
They're using written in Perl, or using Java Servlets, or some other
mechanism.    I repeat --- the number of actual ELF executables on a web
farm is probably a very small number.
