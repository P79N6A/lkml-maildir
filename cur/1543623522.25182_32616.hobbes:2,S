Right from the start Linus has always said he isn't going to force anyone
to use bitkeeper. End of story. If you think its free enough -  use it, if
you don't (or you just think its crap software, dont use it)
In fact if it offends you enough to start a petition take the list of
names you get at the end and between you go write a better one under a
licence you prefer between the signatures.
