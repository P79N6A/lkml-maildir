Right you are (I was thinking m-for-micro, not m-for-milli in my head ;)
- but still, there doesn't seem to be any reason for that divide-by-1000
and reducing the precision in the kernel rather than in userspace, does
there?  Doing it the other way means you wont ever have to worry about
whether it is/isn't sufficient precision for all possible block devices,
and the precision the tool displays will just be a userspace decision.
cheers.
