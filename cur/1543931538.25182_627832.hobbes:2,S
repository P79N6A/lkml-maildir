Basically anything involving IO :-). A boot here showed a handful of
good merges, and probably in the order of 100,000 descending
allocations. A kernel make is a fine test as well.
Something like the below should work fine - if you see oodles of these
basicaly doing any type of IO, then you are screwed.
