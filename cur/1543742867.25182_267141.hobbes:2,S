i see your point, and i agree its not very nice to have specialized
schedulers for particular workloads only. however, as i see it,
plugsched doesent have any direct overhead, and plugsched doesent remove
the ability to develop on one allround scheduler, which tries to handle
all workloads good. however plugsched does give the opportunity to
create specialized schedulers, and as i see it not, staircase does a
better job in handling allround workloads(atleast for me). and it
certainly do make stuff easier.
