Hi Marcelo,
-rc2 seems really fine to me.
But I noticed a strange message at boot time during the PCI IRQ routing through
ACPI, and I'm not sure whether it's an info, a warning or an error :
ACPI: Interpreter enabled
ACPI: Using PIC for interrupt routing
ACPI: System [ACPI] (supports S0 S3 S4 S5)
ACPI: PCI Root Bridge [PCI0] (00:00)
PCI: Probing PCI hardware (bus 00)
Disabling VIA memory write queue (PCI ID 0305, rev 03): [55] 8d & 1f -> 0d
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Routing Table [\_SB_.PCI0._PRT]
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKA] (IRQs 3 4 5 7 *9 10 11 12)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKB] (IRQs 3 4 5 7 9 *10 11 12)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKC] (IRQs 3 4 *5 7 9 10 11 12)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKD] (IRQs 3 4 5 7 *9 10 11 12)
ACPI: Embedded Controller [EC0] (gpe 1)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Routing Table [\_SB_.PCI0.PPB_._PRT]
ACPI: Power Resource [PCR0] (off)
ACPI: Power Resource [PCR1] (off)
schedule_task(): keventd has not started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
=> this one  !!
PCI: Probing PCI hardware
PCI: Using ACPI for IRQ routing
And here is the portion of .config related to ACPI. I can send the whole
config too, but that doesn't seem useful to me to pollute LKML for the rest...
