I don't have an answer for you, but rather a related question... is
there an explaination somewhere of all of the fixed memory locations the
kernel is expecting, what they are used for, and what #defines are
related to each?  I've learned some, but not all of them.
I have a Gnome Dia document in which I've tried to lay out the fixed
memory locations for arm-linux and the mapping of
ioremap<->virt<->phys<->bus.  It's not perfect, but if you want a copy,
email me.
