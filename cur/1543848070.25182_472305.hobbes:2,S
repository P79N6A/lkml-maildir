I agree.  You are trying to use configfs for something that it is not
entended to be used for.  If you want to write/read large numbers of
attrbutes like this, use your own filesystem.
configfs has the same "one value per file" rule that sysfs has.  And
because your userspace model doesn't fit that, don't try to change
configfs here.
What happened to your old ckrmfs?  I thought you were handling all of
this in that.
thanks,
