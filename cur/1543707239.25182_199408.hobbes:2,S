Many terminals will not ever display UTF-8.  Think: all the serial terminals.
This is why I think "stty utf8" or something along those lines would
be useful.  The terminal itself doesn't have to talk UTF-8; however,
the applications talking with /dev/tty would always see UTF-8.
That seems to solve most of the practical user interface problems of
the command line, in one single clean place.
