This early one may not be completly stable, anyway it worked fine for me
so far. I think Mike has some more patch pending and I'll merge it ASAP.
The following features are included in the 2.3.x ikd patch:
  Debug kernel stack overflows
  Detect software lockups
  Kernel tracer (show logic flow through procedures)
      Written by Ingo Molnar <mingo@pc7537.hil.siemens.at>.  Currently
      maintained by Mike Galbraith <mikeg@weiden.de>.
  Print-EIP on video ram
      Improved by Andrea Arcangeli.
  Kernel stack meter
  Kernel real profiling
  Semaphore deadlock detector
      Developed by Andrea Arcangeli.

Have fun with it and report to me and to Mike any problem you have with
it.
Thanks!
Andrea
