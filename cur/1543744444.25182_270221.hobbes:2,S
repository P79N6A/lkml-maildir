Linus,
Yes, when we see a process in TASK_DEAD state, we can't reap it. We 
shouldn't set the flag in this scenario because we have not really found 
an eligible child (one in any state other than TASK_DEAD). So we need to 
go back to parsing the list of children as if we have not found an 
eligible child at all.
Please let us know if this argument is correct and if we have reached 
the final shape for this fix.
Thanks,
Sripathi.
