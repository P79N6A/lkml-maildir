No. I will try this this flag and let you know if I see any
performance difference.
Thanks for your suggestion!

The way we trace syscall entry/exit is similar to the approach
used in LTTng. When tracing is enabled, a special flag,
TIF_KERNEL_TRACE is set so syscall entry and exit call special
syscall_trace_enter and syscall_trace_exit that are patched
to call trace_mark in our old prototype.
