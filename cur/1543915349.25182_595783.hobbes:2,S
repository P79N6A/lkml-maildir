ROFL! Yeah of course, how could I have forgotten about our trusty OOM killer
as the solution to the fragmentation problem? It would only have been funnier
if you had said to reboot every so often when memory gets fragmented :)

I was not implying a new API.

The logical conclusion is that _they are not the same approach_!

I'm not upset, but what you were saying was rubbish, plain and simple. The
amount of times we've gone in circles, I most likely have already explained
this, serveral times, in a more polite manner.
And I know you're more than capable to understand at least the concept
behind fsblock, even without time to work through the exact details. What
are you expecting me to say, after all this back and forth, when you come
up with things like "[fsblock] is not a generic change but special to the
block layer", and then claim that fsblock is the same as allocating "virtual
compound pages" with vmalloc as a fallback for higher order allocs.
What I will say is that fsblock has still a relatively longer way to go, so
maybe that's your reason for not looking at it. And yes, when fsblock is
in a better state to actually perform useful comparisons with it, will be a
much better time to have these debates. But in that case, just say so :)
then I can go away and do more constructive work on it instead of filling
people's inboxes.
I believe the fsblock approach is the best one, but it's not without problems
and complexities, so I'm quite ready for it to be proven incorrect, not
performant, or otherwise rejected.
I'm going on holiday for 2 weeks. I'll try to stay away from email, and
particularly this thread.
