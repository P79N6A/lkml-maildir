	False.  Please cite the section of the GPL version 2 that you
think means that the derived work, once created, *must be
distributed*.  If you read closely, I think you will find that it says
that *if* you distribute the mixed work, then then it must be
distributed under the the terms of the GPL.  If you do *not*
distribute the mixed work, then the GPL does not place any
restrictions on your use of the derived work.  In other words, the
restrictions imposed by the GPL are conditional upon the derived
work's actual distribution:  no distribution, no restrictions.
	Furthermore, "loading into memory" is (arguably) considered an
essential part of running a program, and section 0 of the GPL version
2 says:
    The act of running the Program is not restricted,
	I should insert the usual disclaimer:  I am not a lawyer.
