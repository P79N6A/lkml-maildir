Yes, first message is generated before udev has a chance to act.
And no, I just don't use udev, and I hope very much that it will
not become required (it is slowly becoming - for example, some
packages on Debian (like xen for example) now explicitly depends
on udev - but so far  I managed to satisfy this dependency by
other means).

This primary name isn't at all useful - I can't ifconfig or fdisk it,
and it's not shown in log/dmesg either.
