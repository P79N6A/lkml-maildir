BEFORE:
lkernel@akt$ size vmlinux
    text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
4318525  454484  462848 5235857  4fe491 vmlinux
AFTER:
lkernel@akt$ size vmlinux
    text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
4323161  454484  462848 5240493  4ff6ad vmlinux
which makes it +4636 = +0.11%
I've got the details for */built-in.o if needed.
