Swap "friends" from people to code then its interesting
eg I'd love to be able to do
	EXPORT_SYMBOL_TO(sym, "i2o*.o");
for the i2o code and know that nobody is going to try and use those routines
for non i2o stuff thinking "that looks handy".
I'm not sure if its that managable, _INTERNAL works for a lot of things from
my point of view. Knowing what is and isnt claimed to be an interface helps
so much. Complicating it seems to have few extra payoffs
