It is an error. It will wait <forever> until you enter the [Enter]
key (it's reading from STDIN_FILENO). Then it will return -1 which
means there was an error, the error code in errno is 14 (EFAULT)
or "bad address".
You can configure user-mode code to "seg-fault" upon receiving
such an error. It can print a nasty message and leave a worthless
core file in your directory.
