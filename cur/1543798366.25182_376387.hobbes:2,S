Also, all this stuff is just a band aid because linux OOM behavior is so
fucked up. The VM system just lets the user dig themselves into a huge
over commit, then we get into trying to change every other system to
compensate.  How about cutting things off earlier, and not falling
off the cliff? How about pushing out pages to swap earlier when memory
pressure starts to get noticed. Then you can free those non-dirty pages
to make progress. Too many of the VM decisions seem to be made in favor
of keep-it-in-memory benchmark situations.
