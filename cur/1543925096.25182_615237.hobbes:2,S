CFA spec requires 848a in word[0], not 844a, which explains
why hdparm thought it might be ATAPI.  I've updated my hdparm
source to detect this for hdparm-7.8 (unreleased).
That card (16MB) is definitely buggy.
But your other (1GB) card looks fine.
Thanks.  Somebody else may help with the libata issue.
