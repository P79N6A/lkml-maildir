The normal way to use multithreading under UNIX is the pthread
library. Here the condition variables are the equivalent to kernel
wait queues. So I think to really implement a fast pthread lib based
on futexes one needs some means to implement condition variables
(with synchronous futex release to implement  pthread_cond_wait(..)!).
This could either be done with the exported waitqueue approach or a bit 
easier (but less general) by associating a second hashed waitqueue with 
each futex (maybe marked by the odd offset+1?). Then we would have two 
additional variants of sys_futex (with parameters FUTEX_WAIT, 
FUTEX_SIGNAL).
The principle implementation is:
FUTEX_WAIT:
    add_to_cond_queue
    current->state=INTERRUPTIBLE
    futex_up
    schedule
    remove_from_cond_queue
    futex_down
FUTEX_SIGNAL
    wake_up_all on cond_queue
Later we may also want FUTEX_SIGNAL_ONE and FUTEX_WAIT_TIMEOUT.
The user space code for pthread_cond_wait then of course needs a 
chaining of the protecting pthread_mutex and the futex used as condition 
variable.
