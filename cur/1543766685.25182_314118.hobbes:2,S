Yes, so?  You are harping on this without ever telling a concrete
technical problem with it.
Yes root will assume it's a directory that can be read.  And it will
get -EACCESS.  Is there a problem with this?  Is there a problem with
NFS exports with root_squash (which is the default btw)?  See the
similarity?

Why is this a hack?  What is the problem with it?
NFSv3 implements it's own permission checking based on credentials
returned by the server.  If client doesn't support Posix ACL and
server does, the permission bits _will_ be out of sync with the actual
permission you get on the file, and you will never know why.  Is it a
problem?  Can it be avoided?
How would sshfs client create permission bits for files, which match
the exact permissions that the user has on the server.  The client
doesn't even know the uid of the user on the remote system let alone
what groups it belongs to.
Think about these problems, and if you have a _solution_ that you
think is better, then pray tell me.  If you don't have a solution, but
just want to bad-mouth the current FUSE imlementation, I'm not
interested.
