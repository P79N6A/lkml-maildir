OK, now think about a NUMA-with-small-n system like AMD Hammer.
One of the CPUs will want to allocate from HIGHMEM zone A while
another CPU will start allocating at HIGHMEM zone B. Of course,
with memory access time between the "nodes" being not too different
you'll want to fall back to the "other" HIGHMEM zone before falling
back to the (single) NORMAL and DMA zones.
This could be expressed as:
"node A"  HIGHMEM A -> HIGHMEM B -> NORMAL -> DMA
"node B"  HIGHMEM B -> HIGHMEM A -> NORMAL -> DMA
How would you express this situation in classzone ?

So why would kswapd not go mad _with_ classzone ?
I bet the workaround for that problem has very little
to do with classzones...
