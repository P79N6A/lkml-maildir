Hey Len,
	Sorry for the lack of details here, but I figured I should at least let
you know. On my box at home (nForce1 motherboard w/ voodoo3 video)
2.6.9-rcX kernels hang on boot. Since its my personal system, I haven't
had much time to debug or look into the issue, however I have found that
acpi=off allows me to boot. 
There are no strange error messages, the system just hangs (the
framebuffer console looks to be locked at well - no blinking cursor). 
Any suggestions?  I plan to try the standard acpi=noirq, and pci=noacpi,
but I feel like I tried them awhile ago to no effect.
thanks
-john
