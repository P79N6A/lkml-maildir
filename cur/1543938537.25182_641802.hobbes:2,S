EXPERIMENTAL certainly, but not DEBUG.  Sure, CONFIG_PARAVIRT is 
somewhat useless if you don't also configure Xen/lguest/etc, but running 
a paravirt system on bare hardware will probably be the most common way 
a paravirt kernel gets run (a distro will always enable it and compile 
in whatever hypervisor support they want, but most people will end up 
just running it on bare hardware).  Therefore, we should try to be as 
sure as possible that PARAVIRT works well (ie, indistinguishable from 
non-PARAVIRT) on bare hardware.

Good, I'm glad you feel that way.
