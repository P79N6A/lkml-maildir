That's really great that you have it all figured out.  However, there
are people who actually use config.guess for it's intended purpose -
as an installation/configuration aid.  Given that purpose, why is it 
so hard for you to understand that:
	*-redhat-linux
	*-suse-linux
	*-debian-linux
	*-caldera-linux
	etc
is far more useful than
	*-gnu-linux
What's so darned hard about following that logic?
