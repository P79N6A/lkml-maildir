Far clearer ;-)
With reverse mapping it works for any page count.

But you got it right the first time: we're evicting the page because it's
inactive and we want the memory for something else.  We don't need to give
that page more second chances, it already had its share of chances before
it got this far in the eviction process.  If the file page gets reloaded
before the swap-out completes it just means we chose the victim poorly
in the first place, or we're unlucky.  The latter is supposed to be the
exception, not the rule.

Yes, in this case, the correct thing and the dumb thing.
