You also removed the regs argument from the get_irq functions.  That
is a separate unrelated change, which I would want to think about for
a bit, because at least at one stage I had a use for that parameter.
So the patch is NAK'd as to that part.  I have some patches queued up
already which do some of the other fixes too.  Thanks for your efforts
on this though.
Regards,
Paul.
