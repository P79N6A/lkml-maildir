One thing that bothers me about kexec is how we grab low pages in
kimage_alloc_page(). On a partitioned ppc64 box I will need to grab
memory in the low 256MB and the machine might have 500GB of memory
free. Thats going to take some time :)
Id hate to introduce a separate zone just for this sort of stuff (we
currently throw all memory in the DMA zone). Could we add a hint to
the page allocator where it makes a best effort to grab memory below
a threshold?
