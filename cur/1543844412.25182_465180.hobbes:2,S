yah, the very first commit in my tree is an import of those scripts for 
reference purposes :-)

those graphs contain _much_ less information.
the primary complexity reduction mechanism in hviz appears to be that it adds 
the current file to the done list immediately before it starts the 
breadth-first search of the children.  this eliminates the possibility of 
back edges to previously seen headers, which is why those graphs flow so 
nicely from left to right.  unfortunately, it also discards most of the 
dependency information.
my goal was to retain and present information from _all_ edges in the graph, 
not just those which lead to new children.  even for relatively small 
hierarchies, these graphs generally wind up looking like a big ball of yarn, 
which is where all the confusing colors and numbers come into play.  they are 
the distilled remnants of all the edges that have been pruned.  only a select 
few edges remain to tie the whole thing together.
