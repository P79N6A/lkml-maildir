It really depends on the speed of the robot perhaps ???
My take on all this is that Real Time is really all about worst case 
tolerances on schedule or interrupt deadlines.
Speed is an issue when the tolerances get tight.
If you can stand 100's of milli Seconds then you will probably be OK
most of the time.
Once you start getting below 5 milliSeconds then you need to listen in
to the Real Time mailing lists.
Get below 1-2 milliSeconds then you can go NOWHERE else but Real Time.
IMHO it is unrealistic to attempt to use regular linux without a Real
Time Extension ( RTAI or RTL ) in this range.
You may get it to work on one system / configuration but as soon as you
change something or add another driver you stand the chance of breaking
the application.
