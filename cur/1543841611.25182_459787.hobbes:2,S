It seemed obvious to me that anything else than checking a bit is way to
expensive. I never implemented nor measured any of the alternatives. The
alternative to do the state change every time a writable pte is
established can be implemented without too much trouble. Perhaps I will
give it a try next week.

Yes, that would be really useful for the writable ptes. But I have the
feeling that the actual implementation of it will be tricky.
