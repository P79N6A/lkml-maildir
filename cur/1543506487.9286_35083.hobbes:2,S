I realize that this is not a terribly useful setup, but it was reported to
me by a tester who thought it might be a driver bug of some sort.  I guess
what confuses me is if ARP should map an IP to any device on a host or to a
specific device bound to that IP.  What I'm hearing here is that the binding
of an IP to a specific network interface is only used to determine routing
of outgoing packets, and that any interface can accept incomming traffic for
any IP assigned to the host.
What I had exepected to find was not for the requested IP in an ARP request
to be compared against all IPs on the host, but instead only against any IPs
bound to the interface that the packet was recieved on.
I did question some people about it, but perhaps I'll go do some testing on
other OSs to see how they behave in this strange situation.
Thanks for the feedback,
Chris Leech

Err.. Do you, per chance, have both network cards running on the same
network, with the same network address, and a netmask which will allow
them to listen to the same ARP requests? If so, how could they do
anything different than you describe?
Cheers,
