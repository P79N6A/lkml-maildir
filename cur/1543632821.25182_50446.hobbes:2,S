Subject: 2.5.20 config forward references to CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

arch/i386/config.in tests CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC before it is defined.
dep_bool 'check for P4 thermal throttling interrupt.' CONFIG_X86_MCE_P4THERMAL $CONFIG_X86_MCE $CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC
arch/i386/config.in also includes drivers/acpi/Config.in which tests
CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC before this variable is defined via CONFIG_SMP.
The forward references result in incorrect configurations when
switching config from one cpu type to another or from SMP to UP.
