Sector re-mapping is not a replacement for backing up your data.  It
merely adds resiliance to the disk.  Infact, it's more or less
impossible to get away from these days - modern IDE disks error
correct all the time.  One area of the disk going bad is not an
unlikely event.

Not at all.  A bad sector map in the filesystem is a pointless feature
for a filesystem which will only likely be used on fault tollerant
devices.  It serves no purpose.  The 'it does no harm' argument is
just as pointless.

Doing that kind of thing was quite useful in the 1980s when floppies
were actually expensive and hard disks usually didn't remap bad
sectors.  Nowadays, it usually gains nothing, and may well hide real
faults that could cause data loss later on.

Again, you are talking around the problem - there almost certainly
will be gradual decay with any disk.  You are just not noticing it
because the firmware is handling it.  If you know that there is a bad
sector, and the disk is not re-mapping it, _why_ isn't it remapping
it?
