It's OK Alan, Tom is one of the maintainers for Linux on i-Series
(AS/400) machines (we just haven't got around to sending the patch to
the MAINTAINERS file yet).  Cort and Tom and I are discussing how best
to merge in the i-Series support into arch/ppc and include/asm-ppc but
these drivers can go in as far as I am concerned (and AFAIK Cort
agrees).
Regards,
Paul.
