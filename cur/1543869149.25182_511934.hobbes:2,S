You grabbed a lot of junk but you did grab this line
[17179682.560000] Synchronizing SCSI cache for disk sda: 
Which means sd_sync_cache got called and flushed the data to disk.
I don't think you can do the other needed debugging without a recompile.
The following will generate a vast amount of debug of which only the end
matters. You may well want to build a kernel this way, boot it with
init=/bin/sh and then at the shell prompt do "halt -f" so you don't get
too much debug
In include/linux/libata.h change
#undef ATA_DEBUG                /* debugging output */
#undef ATA_VERBOSE_DEBUG        /* yet more debugging output */
so both of the undef-s read define
#define ATA_DEBUG
#define ATA_VERBOSE_DEBUG
and recompile
