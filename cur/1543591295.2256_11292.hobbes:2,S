Hi,
sometimes the following messages appear in /var/log/messages:
        May 13 14:24:41 sunny kernel: PCI: Found IRQ 10 for device 00:0e.0
        May 13 14:24:41 sunny kernel: PCI: The same IRQ used for device 00:0a.0
"0e" is my PCI sound card, and "0a" is my PCI ethernet card. The messages apppear in
the following environment: I send from another linux machine (per ssh) a command
wich plays some sound on my sound card, therefore the eth0 event and the sound
event occur at almost the same time.
Question: Can I ignore these messages, or is there any buggy behaviour?
Regards
Joachim Backes
