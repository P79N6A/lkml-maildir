After defining LSI in drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c I can get half my luns,
but still not all. I'm not sure what else I need to do. I now can see
LUNs 0,2,4,6,8, etc but not 1,3,5,7,etc. I'm not sure what else to do,
but maybe now that I've done this, I can get information from QLogic
about what should be happening. Or does this still seem like a kernel
config issue?
