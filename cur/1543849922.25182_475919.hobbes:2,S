I ran pi_stress on both the 32-bit kernel (Athlon64x2) and a 64-bit
kernel (Athlon64 up) and am still getting a time warp bug.
I'm rebuilding now with a bit more debug info turned on and I'm trying
to track down an Intel box that I can try this on to see if somehow I'm
exercising a code path that hasn't been touched much. Hopefully I'll be
able to test on a P3/P4 box this afternoon and can confirm or deny
whether this is AMD specific.
