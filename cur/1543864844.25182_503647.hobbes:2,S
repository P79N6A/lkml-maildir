if there was no successfull call to cxacru_poll_status before this,
then you will output junk.  Please initialize cxinf_status to something
sensible in cxacru_bind.

Rather than duplicating code in usbatm, I think it would be better to
split the various output bits in usbatm_atm_proc_read into their own
functions, and export them, so they can be called from both
usbatm_atm_proc_read and cxacru_proc_read.
Best wishes,
Duncan.
