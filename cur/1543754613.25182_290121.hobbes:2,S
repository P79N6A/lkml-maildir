I think that's the case. The 0 address as refered to here is only for
the user virtual address space.

Exactly. Undefined. VAX/UNIX allowed assignment to null pointers. BUT
it's now such a commonly held assumption that a null pointer is not
valid that things will break if this is changed. Doesn't glibc malloc
use mmap for small allocations? From the man page:
RETURN VALUE
  For calloc() and malloc(), the value returned is a pointer to the
  allocated  memory,  which  is suitably aligned for any kind of
  variable, or NULL if the request fails.
This could get pretty confusing if NULL was a valid address...
Cheers,
