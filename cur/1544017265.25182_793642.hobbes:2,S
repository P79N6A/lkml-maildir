Cool! We've got scripts/tracing/ [with one Python script in it already] - 
so if this is tidied up to be generally useful we could put it there.
The other thing is that there's the statistics framework of ftrace, being 
worked on by Frederic and Steve. That tries to handle and provide 
higher-order summaries/"views" of plain traces, like histograms and counts 
- provided by the kernel.
Maybe the above type of multi-dimensional-stack-trace based histogram 
could fit into the statistics framework too?
