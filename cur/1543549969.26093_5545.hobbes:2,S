Dear Helpers:
This is a question from a Linux idiot.  Please bear with me.  I have brought
up a PC running Linux 6.2.  I need to develop a simple C program using
TCP/IP protocol (socket interface) to talk to another PC on the network.  I
need some help in getting the necessary documentation and sample code about
socket interface to write such program.  Any input will be appreciated.
Eric
