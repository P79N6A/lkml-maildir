Sorry, I overlooked that one as I was using the 2.6.5 source.
If I'd do it the same way and only implement .cia_encrypt/.cia_decrypt
functions I wouldn't gain too much from the PadLock. The great thing is
that it can encrypt/decrypt the whole block of data (e.g. the whole disk
sector, 512B) at once using a selected mode (ECB, CBC, ...). With
.cia_encrypt/.cia_decrypt the block chaining is done in software and the
hardware is only called for encryption of a single block (e.g. 16B in case
of AES) at a time. This is a big overhead and throws away most of the
PadLock potential.
That's why I added .cia_ecb/.cia_cbc/... and modified cipher.c to call
these whole-block-at-once methods instead of doing
software-chaining+hardware-encryption. This way it's much much faster and
I don't think that the changes to the cipher.c are somehow unclean.
Or can I achieve the same without extending the API?
