That one introduces a new problem:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/data/src/linux-2.4.20/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes 
-Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -fomit-frame-pointer -pi
pe -mno-fp-regs -ffixed-8 -mcpu=ev5 -Wa,-mev6   -nostdinc -iwithprefix
include -DKBUILD_BASENAME=compat  -c -o compat.o compat.c
make[3]: *** No rule to make target
`/data/src/linux-2.4.20/drivers/pci/devlist.h', needed by `names.o'.  Stop.
In .depend I had to delete the reference to devlist.h and classlist.h.
Dirty, but it made the compilation go on.
