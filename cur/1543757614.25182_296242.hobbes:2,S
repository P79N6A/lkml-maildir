I agree with you. My first implementation was with LSM but Chris Wright
(I think it was him) notice that it's not the right framework (and it
seems true). So I looked for another solution. I though about kobject
but it was too "big" and finally, Greg KH spoke about connectors. It's
small and efficient.

The problem is the following: I have a user space daemon that manages
group of processes. The main idea is, if a parent belongs to a group
then its child belongs to the same group. To achieve this I need to know
when a fork occurs and which processes are involved. I don't see how to
do this without a hook in the do_fork() routine... Any ideas are
welcome.
Thank you Evgeniy for all your comments about the code, it helps and I
will modify the patch.
Regards,
Guillaume
