I'll watch the futex development than and wait for it do be available.

Handles the most common case but not general enough for all cases and its 
sister function atomic_inc_and_test is pretty useless.

Apparently the Microsoft one really is in Windows 98 and up (not in 95).  
I've had it explained that the asm code (semi-pseudo code here) is like this:
        movl       reg, #-1
        lock xadd  reg, counter
        decl       reg
        movl       result, reg
This is in comparison to the current code which does something like this:
        lock decl counter
        sete      result
I don't see how the first asm code lies to you.  It is returning the value as 
it was decremented to and the lock on the xadd keeps it safe.

Its too bad Linux didn't have a nice wrapper around atom inc/dec/test that 
was completely portable.  Do you know what arch's have trouble implementing 
this?
