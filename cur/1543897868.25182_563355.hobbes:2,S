Hi All,
   I am new to linux kernel stuff. I am using Cogent CSB535FS board. I
have configured the kernel to include support for MMC card and also
i.MX MMC driver. When I insert the card, it says :
# imx-mmc imx-mmc.0: card inserted
   So, the kernel has identified that MMC has been inserted. I have
the following dev entries for mmc on the target:
brwxrwxrwx    1 0        0        254,   0 Jun 26  2007 mmcblk0
brwxrwxrwx    1 0        0        254,   1 Jun 26  2007 mmcblk0p0
brwxrwxrwx    1 0        0        254,   2 Jun 26  2007 mmcblk0p1
brwxrwxrwx    1 0        0        254,   3 Jun 26  2007 mmcblk0p2
brwxrwxrwx    1 0        0        254,   4 Jun 26  2007 mmcblk0p3
    How do I access the MMC card data now? If I try to mount it,
busybox doesnot mount it.
# mount /dev/mmcblk0p0 /mnt/mmc
mount: mounting /dev/mmcblk0p0 on /mnt/mmc failed
  I have tried with /dev/mmcblk0p0, mmcblk0p1,etc. But of no use. How
do I access the contents of MMC card? Is there any thing missing in my
settings? Busybox does not say anything other than the above error
message.
Any clue will be appreciated,
Thanks,
Midhun.
