Evgeniy,
First, thanks very much for all your comments and questions.

Some sample code will probably clarify the use of my patch: 
   
http://dev.laptop.org/git?p=users/mstone/test-rlimit-network;a=blob;f=disable_network.c;hb=HEAD
This C code describes a 'disable_network' exec-chain script which, when run as
any user, irrevocably disables network access as described in my previous
emails. 
As you can see, processes start with full access to the 'network' resource and
may, at any time, irrevocably (modulo CAP_SYS_RESOURCE) limit their and their
future children's access to this resource by lowering both their soft and hard
limits to 0.

Nor should it. Applications should continue to be able to send data on any
sockets where were already connected and should be able to accept new
connections on sockets which were already bound.
I have done some primitive testing to ensure that the patch implements this
functionality by means of the test utilities provided here:
  
http://dev.laptop.org/git?p=users/mstone/test-rlimit-network;a=tree
Can you confirm my results?

Why do you think this would happen? 
(My test results, e.g. via
    
http://dev.laptop.org/git?p=users/mstone/test-rlimit-network;a=blob;f=positive_localhost_tcp;hb=HEAD
  show otherwise.)

As Rémi explained, the iptables 'owner' match module solves a different
problem.

This is by design. Limiting my shell's networking privileges in preparation for
running an untrusted command should not limit the privileges of programs that I
have previously started running from the same shell process.
Regards,
Michael
P.S. - Rémi, Scott: Thanks very much for your supportive comments.
