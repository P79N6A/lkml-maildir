I frequently build Mozilla from scratch on my (aging) dual Celeron
machine.  That's about 65 megs of actual C++ source, and it takes
about an hour of real time to compile.  I see times for the whole
build like this:
    real    60m4.574s
    user    101m18.260s
    sys     3m23.520s
with gcc 2.95.2 20000220 (Debian GNU/Linux) under Linux 2.4.2.
The sys-to-user ratio seems much closer to Serge's 2.2.13 numbers than
his 2.4.2 numbers, and I'm wondering why.
If I recall correctly, RedHat's 2.96 was a modified development
snapshot of GCC 3.0, not an official GCC release.  If this is just a
quirk in 2.96 that can be fixed before the official release of 3.0 by
a trivial patch to libiberty, maybe your original hunch was right and
the kernel should be left as-is.

I'm willing to help test out the patch; I'd be curious to see what
effect it has on the performance of 2.95.2.
