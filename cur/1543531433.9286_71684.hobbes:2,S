Hi.
Does anybody have a patch for the kernel, which
enables full support for the 82440MX chipset ?
Or do I have to wait for a 2.4.x kernel ?
I would like to get my AC'97 modem to work and get the
kernel to see 96Mb RAM instead of 64Mb.
(I got the soundcard working using the alsa-driver).
Cheers,
 Jesper -- whoislookingforwardto2.4
BTW: I'm not on the mailing list.
