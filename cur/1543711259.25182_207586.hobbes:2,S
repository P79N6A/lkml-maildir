It lets a task be preempted when state != TASK_RUNNING.  By preventing
the task from being deactivated, it can be rescheduled correctly. 
Otherwise, a task that was, say, TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE could be preempted
before it put itself on a wait queue.
Marking the task that is preempted is a simple solution to the race.
If you want to force the deactivation of the task, there is really no
difference.  Set it to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, do whatever you need to do,
and call schedule().
PREEMPT_ACTIVE is unrelated to what you want to do.
