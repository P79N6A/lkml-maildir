Hi,
I don't know since which moment (maybe I changed something in bios, but usb
legacy kbd was ever enabled), but quirk_usb_disable_ehci takes for both of my
ehci controllers 1.5 s.
More precisely, the time is spent in
pci_write_config_byte(pdev, offset + 3, 1);
by
outb((u8)value, 0xCFC + (reg & 3));
from pci_conf1_write deep in the callstack.
Is there any workaround known or something. Turning legacy usb off is not an
option, I want to control grub.
Thanks.
