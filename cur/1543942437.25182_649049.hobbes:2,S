yeah, although various other upstream breakages prevented real long 
randconfig series in the past 2-3 days. I'd say it's either in this pull 
from your tree:
  Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@woody.linux-foundation.org>

    Merge git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-2.6
    * git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-2.6: (21 commits)
or perhaps in this one:
  Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>
  Date:   Mon Feb 4 07:43:36 2008 -0800
    Merge git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-2.6
    * git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-2.6: (77 commits)
i'll figure it out, it's totally reproducible so it should be easy to 
bisect. Just wanted to know whether you had anything queued up already 
for something like this.
