I see, having suddenly zillion options to go through and disable may be
problem.  Fortunately not in this particular case because none of IDE PCI
host drivers is enabled by default in drivers/ide/Kconfig.
To be sure I've just checked it with:
ARCH=mips make sb1250-swarm_defconfig menuconfig
and it looks fine (all IDE PCI host drivers are disabled).
However big thanks for raising this point.  I was unaware of such side-effect
while working on the above change but from now on I'll keep this in mind. :)

Hmm, it also seems that CONFIG_IDE_GENERIC=y may be removed now because
IDE SWARM host driver does the probing itself?
Thanks,
Bart
