(looks like a fine start to me.  my box [and subjective driver] give it a 
one thumb up plus change;)

Hmm.  I watched priority distribution (eyeballs, not instrumentation), and 
it looked "right" to me until the load reached "fairly hefty"... at the 
point where swap really became a factor, distribution flattened, and the 
mean priority rose (high).  I did see some odd-ball high priority cc1's at 
the low to moderate end (historically indicator of trouble here), but not 
much.  At what I call moderate load, it behaved well, and looked/felt good.
