The "extern" keyword on functions is *completely* redundant.
For C variables:
   Declaration:  extern int foo;
   Definition:   int foo;
   File-scoped:  static int foo;
For C functions:
   Declaration:  void foo(int x);
   Definition:   void foo(int x) { /*...body...*/ }
   File-scoped:  static void foo(int x) { /*...body...*/ }
The compiler will *allow* you to use "extern" on the function  
prototype, but the presence or absence of a function body is  
sufficiently obvious for it to determine whether the prototype is a  
declaration or a definition that the "extern" keyword is not required  
and therefore redundant.
For maximum readability and cleanliness I recommend that you leave off  
the "extern" on the function declarations; it makes the lines much  
longer without obvious gain.
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
