Please explain what problem you see.  If you use mmap to manually load
libpthread.so, and patch up its relocations without going to ld.so,
obviously you get to keep both pieces.  Or are you talking about
synchronizing access to shared mmaped buffers?
This is different from what Linus was talking about precisely because
we can do it imperatively ("I know this program is single-threaded and
I'm telling you so" instead of "Hmm, this program hasn't called clone
yet").
It's not as technologically slick but I'd need a lot of convincing to
believe it wasn't just as useful; and it has the benefit of not
requiring new silicon.
