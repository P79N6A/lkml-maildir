I forgot to include the output of strace... and of course now I can't
repeat the openoffice hang. 
I do get flash 9 (I know, not the best example) and tomboy to hang as
reported by one of my Planet CCRMA users - flash 9 tested working on
stock fedora 7 kernel - and both seem to hang in the same system call:
sched_getaffinity(3528, 32,  <unfinished ...>
Full output of strace attached for both cases. 
Hopefully this will make the bug immediately obvious to someone :-)
