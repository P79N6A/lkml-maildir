When commit_write() FULLY succeed (requested bytes == returned bytes) but
generic_osync_inode() return error due to I/O failure, current 
do_generic_file_write() cannot
return error. I encountered above situation a lot under an I/O trouble 
condition .
In ver 2.6.11, the return value of generic_osync_inode() is returned 
directry to user
when I/O failure occur.
thanks.
