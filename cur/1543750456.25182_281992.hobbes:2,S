I suspect that the removable flag might be used in different GUI:s to 
figure out with block devices should be presented to the user in a nice 
way. It's usually just the removable devices that need some form of 
special handling. So even though, as you point out, the entire device 
disappears it might be useful from a user interface perspective to have 
this hint set. From what I've found this flag doesn't seem to change any 
handling inside the kernel, just how the device should be perceived.
