Large cdb support is just a direct extension of REQ_BLOCK_PC as far as
I'm concerned, it doesn't fit well with the REQ_TYPE_LINUX_BLOCK.

So wrt opcodes, the space from 0x40 and up should be generic Linux
sanctioned opcodes. For the disk shock protection, you would like
something like REQ_LB_OP_PARKHEAD?

There isn't going to be a lot of common code, since all the park
handling will be driver/device specific. It still makes sense to use the
queue as the transport for the command though, using an ioctl is both
ugly from a design POV and (more importantly) has serialization issues
since it's an out-of-band signalling mechanism. If you pass down a
request as the park request, then you need only deal with the device
specific details of parking the head.
