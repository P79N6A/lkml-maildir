Hrmmm. Are you seeing something like:
Loosing too many ticks!
TSC cannot be used as a timesource. (Are you running with SpeedStep?)
Falling back to a sane timesource.
in your dmesg?
I just realized that in clock_fallback() from my lost-tick-speedstep-fix
we don't re-calibrate loops_per_jiffies. The conversion from cycles to
loops should be pretty close, but that might need some additional work. 
Hrmmm..
