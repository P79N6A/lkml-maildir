I have a blacklist of things to remove already I'm stuck carrying and
continuing to remove from what we call "pristine" upstream sources, but
I didn't see any specific suggestion for additions to it or removals
from it. So at the moment I don't have anything to go on as far as what
this thread tells me to do. I'm bothered somewhat by the fact that this
all sounds alarming, but doesn't seem to have anything specific to be
done about it, which is why I asked the participants in this discussion
to try to come to some kind of actual conclusion I could act on.
