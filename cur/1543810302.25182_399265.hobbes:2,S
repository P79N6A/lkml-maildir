Subject: softlockup interaction with slow consoles

When register_console() runs, it dumps the entire log buffer
to the console device with interrupts off.
If you're going over a slow console, this can easily take more
than 10 seconds especially on SMP with many cpus brought up.
This makes the softlock fire, which is terribly annoying :-)
I think the bug is in the console registry code, I think it
should capture chunks of the existing console buffer into some
local memory and push things piece by piece with interrupts
enabled to the console driver(s).
Any better ideas?
