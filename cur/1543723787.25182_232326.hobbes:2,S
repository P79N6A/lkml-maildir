Hello,
I've never reported a kernel error before so please let me know if there is
more info I can provide.  Running 2.6.7 with the kexec patch.  Was not
having these problems with 2.6.5 with the kexec patch.  After the "Unable to
handle kernel paging request" error the machine becomes fairly unresponsive
and a normal reboot is not enough to bring the machine down.  Dmesg and
config attached.
