the CONFIG_BT_SCO option is not problematic, you can leave this on. But
for now you must disable CONFIG_BT_HCIUSB_SCO if you have an UHCI host
controller.

Apply patch-2.6.1-mh3 and rebuild your kernel. This patch only updates
your Bluetooth subsystem. To not run into problems with your modules
undiff the change to the Makefile EXTRAVERSION before calling make.

I know, but our big resync with 2.6 was first in 2.6.2-rc1. And this bug
only occurred on incoming RFCOMM connections.
