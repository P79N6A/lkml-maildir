If I understand it correctly, yes, you want to `push' only one changeset (the
creation of the new file) to the parent repository. Either directly (through
push), or through creating a patch in the child repository and importing it in
the parent repository.
[ Disclaimer: I'm not that familiar with the  problem Tom mentions ]
However, why couldn't BK automatically resolve this?
In BK, a file creation (or a rename) is simply a changeset, just like a change
to the contents of a file (i.e. a patch that affects one file only), right?
If I modify a file in the child repository, and that change ends up in the
same file in the parent repository (i.e. Linus applied the patch I sent there),
BK will automatically resolve the issue when I do a pull in my child
repository.  How is this different from a new file I added in the child
repository, and the same file (with the same contents, or contents from a
previous revision in the child repository) that got added in the parent later?
If I do a pull, BK should `merge' the change (a new file)? Or am I missing
something?
