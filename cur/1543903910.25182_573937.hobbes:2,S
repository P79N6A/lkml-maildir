You don't need to expose the vmas.  You just have userspace point out
the start+len of each region of memory it wants the guest to be able to
access, and the address it wants it to appear in the guest.
This is a slight superset of what lguest does in two ways:
1) my guest address == user address, but I'm looking at adding an offset
so I don't have to link the launcher binary specially.
2) I have only one contiguous region of guest-physical memory, since I
can place device memory immediately above "normal" mem.
But the result is pretty sweet, and doesn't require any new symbols to
be exported.
Cheers,
Rusty.
