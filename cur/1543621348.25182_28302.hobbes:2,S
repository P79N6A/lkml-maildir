O_SYNC writes takes different time depending on the scsi ID?
_Very_ strange, unless your /etc/fstab looks different for
/dev/sdbX and /dev/sdcX  
I.e. different mount options that indeed depend on scsi id.
Also check to make sure nothing else is running and accessing
any partition on sdc, that might force those sync writes
to seek more.  (I guess the slow disk is noisy?)
