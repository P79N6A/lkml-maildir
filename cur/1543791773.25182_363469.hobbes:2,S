The directory position not _on_ an entry, but _between_ two entries.
So it doesn't matter if the next entry is removed, the offset stays
perfectly valid.
If there doesn't remain any entries after the position, readdir should
return EOF.  Otherwise it should continue reading normally.
What SUS doesn't specify is what happens entries added between
opendir() and before rewinddir().
