I've updated kmsgdump for Linux 2.5.75.  The patch is available at
  
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/kmsgdump/2.5.75/
Unfortunately it's not working with Linux-2.6.0-test1 and I haven't
been able to determine why yet.  If someone could point out to me
what subtle x86 changes there were between 2.5.75 and 2.6.0-test1,
I'm listening, or even better, buying beers next week in Canada.
I've been thru the 2.5.75-to-2.6.0-test1 patch file a couple of
times without finding it, and still looking.
Thanks,
