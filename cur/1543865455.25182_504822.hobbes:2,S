Yes, we'd be fine with general reclaim I think. But the calculation of the 
dirty ratio based on ZVCs would need it if we take the mlocked pages off. 
Otherwise we may have dirty ratios > 100%.

Exclusion or inclusion of NR_MLOCK number is straightforward for the dirty 
ratio calcuations. global_page_state(NR_MLOCK) f.e. would get us totals on 
mlocked pages per zone. node_page_state(NR_MLOCK) gives a node specific 
number of mlocked pages. The nice thing about ZVCs is that it allows
easy access to counts on different levels.

Rik also had some uses in mind for allocation?
