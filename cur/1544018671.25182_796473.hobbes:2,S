Would be cool if that API existed. You could release the CPU and/or lock as
soon as either was contended for. You'd have the benefits of fine-grained
locking without the overhead of locking and unlocking multiple time.
Currently, there is no bit that can tell you there is a writer waiting. You'd
probably need to change the write_lock() implementation at a minimum. Maybe
if the first writer left the RW_LOCK_BIAS bit clear and then waited for the
readers to leave instead of re-trying? That would actually make write_lock()
more efficient for the 1-writer case since you'd only need to spin doing
a read in the failure case instead of an atomic_dec and atomic_inc.
