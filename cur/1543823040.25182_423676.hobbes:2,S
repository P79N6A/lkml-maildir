Sharp's 2.4 MMC/SD drivers were binary only for all Zaurus models. Since
we have documentation on the PXA, a 2.6 driver exists and works for all
PXA models as we could guess the power controls and GPIOs. Collie
(SA1100 based) used some kind of SPI interface through the LOCOMO chip
(as far as I know) which we have no documentation on.
