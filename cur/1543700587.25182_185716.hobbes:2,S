How long should the userspace wait? One second as Manuel suggested?
Indefinitely? Or should the firmware agent have some timeout? If userspace
uses a timeout how should it correlate with the timeout on the kernel side?
I am sorry but I have to disagree with you. Kernel should not call user
space until it has all infrastructure in place and is ready. Anything
else is just a sloppy practice.
