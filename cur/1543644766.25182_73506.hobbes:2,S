Why do you want to hot swap disks on a SCSI bus which isn't designed for hot swapping?
There is no guarantee that you could keep the server running in the event of a disk failiure - a faulty disk *could* take the whole bus down with it, (it shouldn't do, but you can't guarantee it), so if you are trying to do this to improve reliability, you might be better off looking at using hot spare disks instead.
