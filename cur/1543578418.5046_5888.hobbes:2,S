And what a pile of crud those patches are!!  Instead of using the clean
replacement interface for get_module_symbol, nvidia/patch-2.4.0-PR hard
codes the old get_module_symbol algorithm as inline code.
This patch violates the modules interface by accessing modules.c
internal data.  It still suffers from all the problems that
get_module_symbol had.  Because it is hard coded as inline code instead
of a common function, will be much harder to fix when it breaks.
Whoever coded that patch should be taken out and shot, hung, drawn and
quartered then forced to write COBOL for the rest of their natural
life.
