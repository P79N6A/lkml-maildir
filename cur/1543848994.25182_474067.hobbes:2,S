You do, however, hopefully have enough information to create the
calls you would make to partition_sched_domain if each had their
cpu_exclusive flags cleared.  Essentially, what I am proposing is
making all the calls as if the user had cleared each as the
remove/add starts, and then behave as if each each was set again.
Thanks,
