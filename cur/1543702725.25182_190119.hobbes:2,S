Assuming ALSA isn't misusing the PnP API, it's indeed not ALSA, but PnP.
It also isn't actually an OPL3 issue, but MPU401. Trouble is that sb16.c 
doesn't set mpu_port to SNDRV_DEFAULT_PORT, but hardcodes the values for 
the first two cards as 0x330 and 0x300 (Takashi: why is that, by the 
way? At least for ISA-PnP cards SNDRV_DEFAULT_PORT would seem better?). 
This causes the initialisation code to call pnp_resource_change() for 
the MPU port resource, which clears IORESOURCE_AUTO for that resource.
The rest of the PnP layer, seeing IORESOURCE_AUTO clear, then never 
touches that resource again, but at that point IORESOURCE_IO (indicating 
an I/O port resource) hasn't yet been set, so that when it later gets to 
isapnp_set_resources(), that function bails out believing it has reached 
the end of the I/O port resources for the device. Since SB is resource 
0, MPU401 resource 1 and OPL3 resource 2 for the device, only SB gets 
enabled, MPU401 and OPL3 do not.
Making sure IORESOURCE_IO gets set fixes it. Having 
pnp_init_resource_table() do this seems proper.
The attached patch works for me:
