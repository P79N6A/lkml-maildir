it's not my machines. they work fine :) but there where bug reports on linux-pcmcia
for this problem...only shows up with kernel >= 2.6.17. see also bug 6801.
2.6.16 shows this:
	  PCI: PCI BIOS revision 2.10 entry at 0xfb9a0, last bus=0
	  PCI: Using configuration type 1
while 2.6.17+ shows only
	  PCI: PCI BIOS revision 2.10 entry at 0xfb9a0, last bus=0
so accessing the cardbus cards is not possible with PCI BIOS but works
just fine with direct access...

sure, but the point is: it used to work on those boxes, but broke with 2.6.17
ok, i had a look. the problem is not the patch itself. look at arch/i386/pci/legacy.c
it's where those messages come from:
	PCI: Probing PCI hardware
	PCI: Discovered peer bus 02
	PCI: Discovered peer bus 05
now if pcibios probing never runs pcibios_last_bus is -1 and pcibios_fixup_peer_bridges()
exits immediatley, the other busses are never found...but why legacy probing anyway?
