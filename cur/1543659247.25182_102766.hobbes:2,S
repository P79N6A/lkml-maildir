  i've attached a gzipped patch against 2.5.56 for reorganizing
the filesystem menu under "make xconfig", and i'm certainly
open to feedback/comments/criticism/large sums of money.
  some points about this patch:
1) if anyone wants to carefully check the dependencies and
   make sure they're correct, that would be nice.
2) perhaps making sure the dependencies match the claims
   in the help screens would be helpful.  i noticed that
   the help screens sometimes make dependency claims that
   are wildly untrue, but i didn't want to mess with that
   stuff yet as i wasn't totally comfortable.
3) much to my delight, i found out by accident that i can 
   add leading asterisks to menu and config lines with no
   effect on the eventual config step -- this makes it 
   wonderfully easy to edit and reorganize using emacs
   outline mode, particularly showing subdependencies.
   is this just a fluke?  obviously, it's easy enough to
   strip out the leading asterisks in the final version,
   but if they're not doing any harm, i'd just as soon 
   leave them in.
thoughts?
