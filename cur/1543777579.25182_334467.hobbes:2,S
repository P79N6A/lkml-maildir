That doesn't mix very well with variable ticks. And I believe
we really need them.
For no tick in idle you need a timer for each CPU that
can be programmed to a reasonably long interval to wake you
up after longer idleness. And all that
should work without bouncing cache lines around all the time
because that doesn't work on larger systems.
