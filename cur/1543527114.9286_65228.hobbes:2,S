MADV_CLEAN, or perhaps a different syscall mdiscard() (as it's page
based and doesn't change vmas) looks utterly wrong for this application,
but it does have a very nice use for memory allocators.
With memory allocators you could use mdiscard to tell the kernel to
decide whether to replace a privately mapped page by its original
backing page.
For /dev/zero that means you can let the kernel decide whether to
reclaim the memory, or if the application can keep the page.  The nice
part is that the decision can be deferred: you are simply informing the
kernel that a page can be reclaimed later on demand.  But the
application doesn't need to know when the decision happens -- it assumes
it is immediate.
This is appropriate for freed memory areas, and is not something that
the application can do itself.  mmaping /dev/zero over the page doesn't
work because that _always_ causes an undesirable zero copy, not to
mention expensive vma operations, when what you want is to simply mark
pages for potential reclaim _if_ the kernel decides it could reclaim the
page in the intervening time.
enjoy,
