x86 is a complicated family...
My current list of CPU specific questions is:
- Does the Cyrix III support 686 instructions?
- Do -march=winchip{2,-c6} and -march=c3{,-2} add anything not in
  -march=i686 (except optimizations of otherwise compatible code)?
- Which CPUs exactly need X86_ALIGNMENT_16?
- X86_GOOD_APIC: Are there really that many processors with a bad APIC?
TIA
