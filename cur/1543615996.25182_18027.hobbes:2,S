I'm taking my rules file from Giacomo Catenazzi, who developed it
originally for a shellscript he wrote.  I don't know how he generates
the hardware probes; for all I know, he's got code groveling through
the module device tables.
I've been meaning to ask you about this, Giacomo.  Where *did* all
those probes come from?

Don't think of it as `gun control', think of it as `victim
