Hi all,
  I have been coming across a problem with my serial port EXAR chip XR
17D152, when I try to use the 8250_pci driver.  I am using
kernel-2.6.12.1 on RHEL4.0-U1 on pSeries box with 4-cpu.  8250_pci
during the boot time, after detecting the exar chip (I checked with the
pci_dev structure and the pci_device_id structure for the info), is
unable to get thru the port registration (static int
__devinit_pciserial_init_one(struct pci_dev *dev, const struct
pci_device_id *ent) procedure in 8250_pci.c).  I debugged the problem
and traced upto the routine "static int uart_match_port(struct uart_port
*port1, struct uart_port *port2" in 8250.c where UPIO_MEM is not
satisfying the condition port1->membase==port2->membase and hence
returns 0.
  If I use the printk for dumping the port-> membase value the system
hags during the boot time with a blank screen (on the serial terminal).
I am yet to try with kernel-2.6.12.2.  Please let me know how to proceed
in this case.  Thanks,
V.Ananda Krishnan
