http://www.xs4all.nl/~ekonijn/yaird/yaird-0.0.7.tar.gz
Yaird is a proof of concept perl rewrite of mkinitrd.  It aims to
reliably identify the necessary modules by using the same algorithms
as hotplug, and comes with a template system to to tune the tool for
different distributions and experiment with different image layouts.
It requires a 2.6 kernel with hotplug.  There is a paper discussing it at:
