Dear All,
	Can anybody advise me of reliable public read access nntpserver
which carries fa.linux.kernel? The server I have been using recently
(news.edu.sollentuna.se) has stopped working. This newsgroup is not on my
local campus nntpserver, nor AFAICT is it carried by the upstream servers
of the Janet (.ac.uk) news service. Alternatively, would any kind person
be prepared to give me read access to one of their servers which carries
fa.linux.kernel? I really don't want to have to go back to the mailing
list or rely on web based newsreaders... 
Thanks
Tom.
Ps. Please could you cc: me any followups (for obvious reasons).
