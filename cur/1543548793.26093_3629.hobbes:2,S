That would work for ordinary (stateful) filesystems where you open it,
then read/write whatever you need then close the file.
The reason I'm sceptical to this and other in-core type solutions is
that knfsd doesn't keep files open for long: basically it opens a file
and close it upon processing of each and every request from a
client. You can therefore easily risk losing the inode between two
requests while the file is still open on the client.
If this means that you also lose part of the info in the mtime field,
then you will trigger a data cache invalidation on the client.
It's very important to avoid excessive cache invalidation if you want
stuff like mmap() to work on the client.
Cheers,
