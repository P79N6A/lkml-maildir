yeah, I was already on a half-way to check it out.
It does fix a problem for me.
Don't forget to take along these 2 fixes from Peter's patch:
- fix break usage in do_each_thread() { } while_each_thread().
- fix the hotplug switch stmt, a fall-through case was broken.
Rafael, does your system still hangs? I'd expect, yes -- as
effectively this fix is not that different from Peter's one when it
comes to suspend-case.
Can you then send your config? Anything special about this machine
(say, some /proc tunables are altered)?
