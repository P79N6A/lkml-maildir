Those BUG_ON's were there because of past bugs and fragility in the
de_thread and exit synchronization stuff.  There's no real need to leave
them (in fixed form) if we are confident of that stuff working right now,
or have other assertions to give us that confidence when we change it.
Thanks,
Roland
