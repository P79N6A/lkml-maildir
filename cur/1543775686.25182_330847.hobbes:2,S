Sorry to say that, but:
I definitely won't be interested in bug reports from an automated tool
like this. I don't have the time to go through the heaps of information
it collects - I need a short and to the point description of the problem
from the user. Most of the time less is more, and if something is
missing, asking is always an option.
As if bug reports filled exactly in accordance with the "Reporting Bugs"
howto from Richard Gooch weren't bad enough.
