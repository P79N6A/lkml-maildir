Alan's opinion in [1] sounds reasonable (and I trust that he knows what 
he is talking about).

I don't think we want to expose maintainership information to users at 
all:
- duplicates information in MAINTAINERS
- maintainers sometimes disappear
- the 3 year old kernel of your distribution would contain 3 year old
  maintainership information
IMHO the default should be that users report problems with distribution 
kernels to their distribution and problems with ftp.kernel.org kernels 
to either linux-kernel or the kernel Bugzilla.
