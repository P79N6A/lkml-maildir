[Leviticus 18:23]: "Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself
therewith:  neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto:
it {is} confusion."
[Leviticus 20:15-16]: "And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to
death: and ye shall slay the beast. And if a woman approach unto any beast, and
lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely
be put to death; their blood {shall be} upon them."
[Romans 1:32]: "Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such
things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them
that do them."
