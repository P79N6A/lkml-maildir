Note that if ZONE_DMA is off then ZONES_WIDTH may become
0 and therefore also ZONES_PGSHIFT is zero.
If you then do
#define ZONEID_PGSHIFT ZONES_PGSHIFT
then ZONEID_PGSHIFT will be 0!
So this could be an issue for the optional ZONE_DMA patch.
Could you also make sure that ZONEID_PGSHIFT is set correctly even if 
ZONES_WIDTH is zero?
This affects the optional ZONE_DMA patch. zone table removal should be 
fine with just the above patch.
