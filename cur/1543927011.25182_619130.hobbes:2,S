Subject: [patch/backport] CFS scheduler, -v24, for v2.6.24-rc3, v2.6.23.8, v2.6.22.13, v2.6.21.7
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

By popular demand, here is release -v24 of the CFS scheduler patch.
It is a full backport of the latest & greatest scheduler code to 
v2.6.24-rc3, v2.6.23.8, v2.6.22.13, v2.6.21.7. The patches can be 
downloaded from the usual place:
    
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/
There's tons of changes since v22 was released:
    36 files changed, 2359 insertions(+), 1082 deletions(-)
that's 187 individual commits from 32 authors.
So even if CFS v22 worked well for you, please try this release too and 
report regressions (if any).
There are countless improvements in -v24 (see the shortlog further below 
for details), but here are a few highlights:
 - improved interactivity via Peter Ziljstra's "virtual slices" feature.
   As load increases, the scheduler shortens the virtual timeslices that 
   tasks get, so that applications observe the same constant latency for 
   getting on the CPU. (This goes on until the slices reach a minimum 
   granularity value)
 - CONFIG_FAIR_USER_SCHED is now available across all backported 
   kernels and the per user weights are configurable via 
   /sys/kernel/uids/. Group scheduling got refined all around.
 - performance improvements
 - bugfixes
99% of these changes are already upstream in Linus's git tree and they 
will be released as part of v2.6.24. (there are 4 pending commits that 
are in the small 2.6.24-rc3-v24 patch.)
As usual, any sort of feedback, bugreport, fix and suggestion is more 
than welcome!
