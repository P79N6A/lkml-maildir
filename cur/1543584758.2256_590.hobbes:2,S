BTW, the script I used (originally written by Paul Gortmaker), does pass the
lines in [C,c]onfig.in through grep -v define_ to catch items which are defined
with define_bool or define_int.  Here is a short list of new CONFIG_ items which
got filtered out:
CONFIG_ARCH_S390X
CONFIG_CRIS_LOW_MAP
CONFIG_FBCON_STI
CONFIG_FUSION_BOOT
CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT_FTP
CONFIG_MTD_AMDSTD
CONFIG_PARISC32
CONFIG_SPARC32
CONFIG_SPARC64
CONFIG_TQM8xxL
As far as appending _DERIVED is concerned, I like the idea, but there might be
quite a time where it was only partially implemented, just confusing things.  Unless
those CONFIG_XXX_DERIVED items all got renamed at once like the great redo
300+ Makefiles adventure last fall.
