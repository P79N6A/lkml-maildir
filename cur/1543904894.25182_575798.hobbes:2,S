Okay, so let's say we've got a loop around a blocking read on the modem 
file descriptor...
  for (;;) {
      read some data from modem
      process data from modem
      if (end-of-data detected) break;
  }
Are you suggesting that the application should be using deasserting RTS 
after the read and asserting it before?
I had previously thought that the control of RTS was something that the 
serial/tty driver was supposed to do independently based on the buffer 
fill.  Was I wrong?
Thanks,
Lee.
