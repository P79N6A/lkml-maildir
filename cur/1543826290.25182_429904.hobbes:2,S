no ... lets not mix threaded IRQs in here. The model of executing an 
interrupt handler has nothing to do with the irq flow itself. Whatever 
can be done with a threaded handler can be done via atomic ISRs too.
pretty much the only correct solution seems to be to go with Arjan's 
suggestion and make the 'disabled' property per-action, instead of the 
current per-desc thing. (obviously the physical act of masking an 
interrupt line is fundamentally per-desc, but the act of running an 
action "behind the back" of a masked line is still OK.) Unfortunately 
this would also mean the manual conversion of 300+ places that use 
disable_irq()/enable_irq() currently ... so it's no small work. (and the 
hardest part of the work is to find a safe method to convert them 
without introducing bugs)
