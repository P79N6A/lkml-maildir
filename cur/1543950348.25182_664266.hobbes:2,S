Then why not do that from userspace with a different /dev, or with a
LSM?

No reason you can't modify udev to do something like this.  At the
worse, just disable udev warning messages, that is pretty trivial to do.
This really makes it seem like this kernel change is not needed at all.

LSM does this quite well today, why reinvent the wheel and put wierd
hooks in other parts of the kernel that do not need them at all?
