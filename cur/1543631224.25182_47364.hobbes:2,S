Yes and no.
There is a race, and yes, another thread might mark it dirty.
However, I've not decided whether we care about it yet. I think we _do_
care, for people doing strange things with their own internal VM
management using mmap/munmap of shared mappings, but on the other hand it
_is_ fairly expensive to do a "ptep_get_and_clear()".

Yeah, I want to do it, but I also would really want to avoid the overhead
for the exit case. Which is another reason I'd like to have exit() not use
zap_page_range() at all.
But I'll make that change now, so that we don't lose it. We should just
remember to not do it if we split up exit.
