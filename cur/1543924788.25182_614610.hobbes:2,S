I looked at your .config and now your  build. It looks like you select
CONFIG_4xx (I see -Wa,-m405) and compile swsusp_32.S. The
compiler/toolchain does not enable altivec instructions for CONFIG_4xx.
If CONFIG_HIBERNATION is enabled as in your case, it compiles
swsusp_32.S which assumes that ALTIVEC is enabled (see CPU_FTR_ALTIVEC).
You ideally need to have -Wa,-maltivec passed in your CFLAGS.
