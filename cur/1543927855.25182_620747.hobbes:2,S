Perhaps I'm missing some context here. We don't free skbs with
destructors in irq context in zap_completion_queue. We reinsert them on the
completion list. We do this by calling dev_kfree_skb_any.
So I'd be surprised if that was a problem. But I can imagine having
problems for skbs without destructors which run into one of these in
__kfree_skb:
dst_release
secpath_put
nf_conntrack_put
nf_conntrack_put_reasm
nf_bridge_put
..some or all of which assume a softirq context.

Some skbs we definitely -can- free in irq context. The only ones we
care about are the ones generated by netpoll. If there's a reason you
think netpoll's own skbs can't be freed, please describe it.

Huh?
