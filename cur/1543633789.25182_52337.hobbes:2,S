This system is a Tyan S2460 with 2 AMD 1600+ processors.  I am not booting 
with the "noapic" option.  (Haven't needed to)  The Promise Ultra133TX2 
(20269) runs very happily with the AMD7411 that is on the mobo.  The 
Promise BIOS recognizes both attached drives as UDMA(133) and the kernel 
sets them up and uses them properly.  I do not need to do anything special 
at boot time either.  It just works!

I agree that some kind of warning (maybe the "EXPERIMENTAL" note in 
menuconfig) is appropriate for drivers that have known issues with certain 
pieces of hardware.  However, I can not condone pulling the driver from 
the kernel.  If it is working perfectly for some people, we would be 
penalizing them.
