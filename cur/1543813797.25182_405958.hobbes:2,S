Really? VM subsystem is supposed to be effective.

"more pages to be discarded" is untrue. If you want to argue that swap
needs to be compressed, feel free to submit patches for swap
compression.
(Compression is actually not as important as you paint it. Rafael
implemented it, only to find out that it is 20 percent speedup in
common cases -- and your gzip actually slows things down.)

...but allows you to use machine immediately after resume, which
people want, as you have just seen.
