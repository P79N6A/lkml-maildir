Please post the full error message.  Does the error message always
contain the same scancode?
My guess is you can get out of that without a reboot.  Next time it
happens, try this:
   1. Press and release each Ctrl key. (This makes sure the key_down
      array is correct.)
   2. Switch to another console and back again. (This executes the
      compute_shiftstate function, which recalculates the shift
      state from the key_down array.)
