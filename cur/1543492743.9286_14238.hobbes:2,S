No, it definitely removes flexibility.  And it's starting to get very low
marks for correctness...
wrt many of the 'sticky bit' problems, Eric Biederman made the excellent
(and I believe completely correct) suggestion of requiring both the sticky
bit and the immutable bit, which solves the problem of booting an older
kernel, since users can't set the immutable bit.  I've been thinking some
about the best semantics for this, but you can derive them as well.  A lot
of the real work can be done in userspace and taken out of the kernel. 
What remains is the nfs problem, which may be solvable (for instance, can
nfs return extended file attributes?); or maybe we just have to accept
that nfs won't work with real capabilities support without major
modifications.  (capabilities in the fs is considered the ideal, I
believe)  In any case, with Eric's suggestion, the sticky-bit solution
gives us the ability to create a complete and true capability-enabled
system _now_.  If you're running a system with this security model, you
should probably re-think using nfs anyway.

Because, if I log in remotely, I probably won't have _any_ caps when I log
in, but my executable _will_.  This is an added flexibility in the sticky
bit solution.

Of two real security problems mentioned, I feel Eric Biederman has already
closed one very satisfactorily.  You obviously have much more experience
with nfs than I do, would you mind sparing a few cycles to see if a
satisfactory solution exists?

Like I said, please think of a solution.  The CODA code may well be very
easily fixable, since it's not in wide deployment yet and there are few
mutli-platform issues to consider.  Heck, how many UNIX platforms really
use the sticky bit for it's old intended use?  Maybe this could become a
new standard for a compatible way to enable capabilities on multiple
platforms. ;-)

Fixed.

The sticky bit solution can work just fine with tar, cp, cpio ... I've
tried to think through proper semantics, and basically it works like
before: previously, only root could create files with setuid root set;
now, only a process with CAP_SETFCAP can create files with the sticky bit
(and therefore the immutable bit; this must go into kernel).

Well, for one, the standard for capabilities doesn't exactly have a 'deny
mask' as such; it would have to be done in the interaction of the current
process' inheritable set and the file's inheritable set.  You _could_ just
put a flat 'deny' mask in there, but you get further from true
capabilities, and the file owner can modify them.

Actually, if we use real capabilities, the inheritable set is important,
too, since it determines what caps the new process can inherit from the
current process.  It still needs to be flagged.  I've already pointed out
the problem with flagging it 'setuid0'.  If you _don't_ flag it, then the
user who owns the file can set the inheritable mask at will.  At this
point, we need to decide how far we wish to depart from real capabilities
to implement the setuid0 hack; or, if we want to migrate to real
capabilities, how do we fix the remote fs problem with stickybit/immutable
bit capabilities.

I'm referring to what I read in the 'linux-privs' paper at kernel.org.
Executables just don't _have_ a deny mask in this system.  The way a new
process gets it's caps is, IMHO, a bit queer.  The more I think about it,
though, the more sense it makes.
To quote the linux-privs document:
"pP' = fP | ( fI & pI ).
Or in other words, the process' permitted set becomes the combination of
the permitted set of the exec()'d file and those inheritable capabilities
of the exec()ing file that are also inheritable by the file."
Where the permitted set is the set of caps legally raisable in the
effective set.
So, though it seems a bit strange at first, the new process can get
permitted caps that are neither present in the parent, nor set in the
file's permitted set.  I assume the POSIX spec which I've asked about
ordering will talk more about this; and indeed, there's more info in the
linux-privs doc.  For your convenience:
http://www1.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs/doc/linux-privs.html/linux-privs-3.html

It is possible that root may log in remotely with no caps, but still have
fs rights. I reallize the implications of this with current systems, but
this is an inherent flexibility in the capabilities-based system.  It also
allows for the possibility of say, the security officer (from Ted's
example) having CAP_SETFCAP and being uid!=0.

Like I said, this appears to be the only remaining problem to be solved;
or discarded w/o major nfs mods, which would be required for true fs
capabilities anyway.

Same argument about the ways caps should actually work applies.  A 'deny'
mask isn't part of the spec, and the file owner can still modify it at
will.

Are you happy with the immutable bit solution to this?
[snip more about nfs problems]
I have no good solution in mind for nfs, unless nfs can return extended
file attributes, in which case, problem solved.  Otherwise... well, ideas?

Geez, this has gotten long.  I'll say, though, that I'm thoroughly
enjoying our discussion, and enjoy being made to _think_ and _read_ and
_learn_.  I don't think I've been this happy since the last time I took
quantum mechanics.
