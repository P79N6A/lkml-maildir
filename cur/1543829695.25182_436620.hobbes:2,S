last I read they are both actively discouraged and ignored by all
"current" processors from both AMD and Intel. (see the optimization

Note: this is based on me reading public documentation, not on me
reading Intel internal stuff or asking the relevant chip architects, so
don't take this as a fully authoritative statement.
