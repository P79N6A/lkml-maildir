Several things have escaped you:
  1 - common politeness - the question was reasonable
  2 - sound doesn't work on ASUS laptops up thru at least 2.6.15.3
  3 - Fedora is user supported
Having spent months trying to convince people that there was no 
{various_things} to mute or unmute, it didn't work with earphones 
either, etc, I decided that given a choice between (a) Windows, (b) a 
new laptop which might not work either, or (c) a cheap USB sound setup, 
I decided to stop banging my head on that particular rock.
My friend bought one at the same time I did, he reports that neither the 
latest Fedora kernel, 2.6.15.6, or 2.6.16 works. Downloading the latest 
ALSA patches may work if they apply to the kernel you have.
