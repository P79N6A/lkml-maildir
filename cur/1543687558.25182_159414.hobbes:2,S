Hi,
Is there any way to manually set the UDMA timings used to interface with 
a drive?
I can see in the PDC20269 driver that it is responsible for setting the 
timings, but I'm not sure how to adjust them at runtime.  My UDMA-2 
drive reverts to PIO after trying a write.  Oddly, I can read from the 
drive using UDMA, it just times out and reverts to PIO when I try to 
write anything to it.
This is with kernel 2.6.0-test3...
Thanks,
Wes
