Can someone point me to his patch?  I've been working on and off to try and get 
reasonable OOM behaviour.  As it stands, 2.6.10-rc2-mm4 still shows nasty 
behaviour in OOM conditions, killing off more tasks than strictly required, and 
locking up the system for 10-15secs while doing it.
I'd be much happier doing a quick and dirty scan and knocking off something 
*now* rather than locking up the system.  Surely it can't take 60 billion cycles 
of cpu time to pick a task to kill.
