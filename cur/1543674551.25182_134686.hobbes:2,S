I know that LBA48 wasn't in the 2.4.19 kernel that was on the
boot/installation media I was using; cfdisk and everything else only saw
the 137.  Once I installed 2.4.20, the kernel and all the tools can see
the whole drive; just the BIOS listing is still wrong.
(Well, can't boot off the drive with GRUB in the MBR.  So there may still
be something wrong there.  Lose2K can boot from that drive, but not the
latest GRUB.)
I will try to give .21-rc2 a spin before I go out of town next week.  Thanks!
