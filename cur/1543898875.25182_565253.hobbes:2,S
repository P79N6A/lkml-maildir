Well, there's nothing in lockdep that guarantees that. I'd be much more
comfortable doing that when lockdep had a STATIC_LOCKDEP_MAP_INIT()
macro that looks like my __WORK_INIT_LOCKDEP_MAP() macro because then
people changing lockdep would see that they cannot rely on
lockdep_init_map() having been called (unless subclass != 0)
