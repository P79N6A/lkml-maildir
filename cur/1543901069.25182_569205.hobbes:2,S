Yes.

Last time I used file->f_mapping->host-> for this in another driver Al
Viro asked me to use the f_path sequence instead. So I've always done
that since.
If it is correct to use the other then generic_file_llseek looks fine, if
not perhaps we need generic_device_llseek() ?
Al - there are many clones of these lseek methods - which should we be
using ?
