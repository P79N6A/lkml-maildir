I have a habit of commenting the code spots where it is not obvious
what is going on.
Someday I am going to learn that everytime I feel the compulsion
to write a "Watch out !" or "Beware !" or "Must !"  code comment,
it probably means that I am coding crap.
I usually end up ripping out the code, after some bug has whacked
my upside the head.
