If you follow the thread back, YOU were the one who decided to choose
compiling a new kernel. Christoph presented the options.
- do it yourself
- ask the fedora legacy folks to do an upgrade kernel with a new drm.
There's also a third option
- Upgrade your distro to something more recent.
And yes, I stand by these points with my Red Hat on.

There's already a per-distro mechanism to make all this all nice and
transparent to end-users.  In Fedora, we even have 3 (apt-get/yum/up2date).
The problem is when 3rd parties like the DRI project expect users not to
use the tools they are familiar with, and expect them to run off to fetch
bits from websites and replace random bits of their system.
Who do you think gets the support calls and blame when the X server breaks
because the user bodged it ?

Thats a different kettle of fish. One day we might have an answer for
that (look up kexec if you're interested).
