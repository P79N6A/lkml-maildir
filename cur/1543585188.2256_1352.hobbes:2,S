IMHO the above line is a bad construct.  If the type of the variable
changes it is extremely easy to miss the fact that *alloc is now
returning the wrong size.  I always do
	busy = kmalloc(sizeof(*busy), GFP_KERNEL);
and let the compiler insert the correct type.
For the checker, you can also have typeof().  kdb has this line
	typeof (*ef)    local_ef;
The type definition of ef is kdb_eframe_t which is "pointer to some
arch dependent type" and local_ef is in arch independent code, much
easier to do this than use multiple #ifdef.  Of course it would have
been even easier if kdb had separate types for the struct and the
pointer to the struct, then I would not need typeof().  OTOH I am sure
that somebody will find a use for typeof().
