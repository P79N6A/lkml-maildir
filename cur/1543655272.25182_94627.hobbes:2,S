This patch updates UML to 2.5.50.  As far as UML itself is concerned, this
is identical to 2.5.49.
NOTE: I get reproducable filesystem corruption with this version.  Offhand,
it doesn't look like my fault, so I'm releasing it anyway.  I didn't notice
any such complaints (or fixes) about 2.5.50 on lkml, but it's possible I
wasn't paying enough attention.  If there is a fix, apply it first.  If not,
then run this version on a filesystem that you can afford to have trashed.
The 2.5.50 UML patch is available at
