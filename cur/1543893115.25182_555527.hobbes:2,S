Don't forget to update Documentation/00-INDEX when you add the document :-)

Shouldn't that be "can't provide a stable interface either" ?

You write "to use an abstract-as-possible way to" I would have written

"it's" is short for "it is", not the same as "its" which I believe is
what you want here.
