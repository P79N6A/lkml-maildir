   Or should we leave that usage unless it is observed causing
   problems (since we almost always get lucky and don't touch the rest
   of the cache line near the DMA)?
I think passing in a 4 byte chunk and assuming the rest of the
cacheline is unmodified is a valid expectation the more I think
about it.
This means what MIPS is doing is wrong.  For partial cacheline bits it
can't do the invalidate thing.
