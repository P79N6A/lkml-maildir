Many drivers are appearing in user space anyway, often with truly token
kernel support. Examples
   - XFree86 (uses mmap and user space dma)
   - SANE (uses scsi generic, perhaps ide-scsi emulation)
   - cdrecord (uses scsi generic, perhaps ide-scsi emulation)
   - ghostscript (de-facto printer drivers)
Locking the kernel interfaces down won't help any company coding binary
only drivers for any of these projects. 
My point: the "problem" is much broader than just the kernel. You can't
save the world by locking down the Linux kernel driver interfaces.

Every stability issue I've ever had with Linux has been traced to a bug
in a driver. Binary only drivers would have meant adding kludges to the
kernel to work around bugs in the drivers. No thanks. I want source for
my driver, and if I have source, there's no problem changing interfaces
and recompiling (someone will know how it's done).
My point: there's no such thing as a "stable kernel release" if drivers
are available only in binary form. Drivers Needs Source.
ObReligiousArgument: whether everything needs source or not isn't worth
arguing about, but drivers are too valuable to be binary only.
