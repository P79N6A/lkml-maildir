Nope, we also disabled all unneeded periferies, like serial and parallel
ports.
But maybe the /proc/interrupts could be usefull:
           CPU0       CPU1       
  0:     413111          0          XT-PIC  timer
  1:        687          0          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  7:     751660          0          XT-PIC  eth1
 10:    7377626          0          XT-PIC  eth0

 14:         10          0          XT-PIC  ide0
NMI:          0

This is how it looks like, since we have the apic disabled. I've tried to
avoid that the Mylex and the Adaptec (aic7xxx) get the same irq, but the
bios was too lame on these things :(
