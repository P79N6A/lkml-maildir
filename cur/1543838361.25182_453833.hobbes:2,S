Wow, a special kind of hell for a filesystem developer...! ;-)
Its not clear to me where the rename operation happens in all of
this - does rsync create a local, temporary copy of the file and
then rename it?  Is it that central server going down or one of
those 28 other server machines?  (I assume it is, I can't see an
opportunity for renaming out there...).
When you hit it again, could you grab the contents of the inode
(you'll get that from xfs_repair -n, e.g. 412035424 above) with
xfs_db (see last entry in the XFS FAQ which describes how to do
that), then mail that to me please?  If you can get the source
and target names in the rename that'll help alot too... I can
explain how to use KDB to get that, but maybe you have another
debugger handy already?
thanks!
