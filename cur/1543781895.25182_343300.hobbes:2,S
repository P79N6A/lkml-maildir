Binary only firmware and firmware loading is perfectly compatible with
the GPL, as long as the vendor includes a license to redistribute the
firmware.  The problem was that vendors were distributing the firmware
embedded in the driver code as a big hex string, without a separate
license, which made the firmware fall under the GPL, which make the
whole kernel undistributable as there's no source code for the firmware.
