I'm using 2.4.0-test3 (i386).
After I load the usbcore module, I can mount
usbdevfs:  mount -t usbdevfs usbdevfs /proc/bus/usb
Actually I can do this multiple times, which I
understand is a fairly new feature.  OK.
And when I mount usbdevfs 2 times, the usbcore
module has a use count of 2.  Sounds reasonable.
So when I umount usbdevfs (when it is mounted 2 times),
the use count for the usbcore module has a use count
of 1 and I can't rmmod it.
Is this likely to be a VFS problem^W feature or
a problem in usbdevfs?
Thanks,
~Randy
