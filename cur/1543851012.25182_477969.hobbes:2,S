Further to this, I gave using list.h a go. Unfortunately it doesn't look
to me like it is a good idea: in adding a range, I'm comparing the new
range to the maximum of one extent and the minimum of the next, so
finding the minimum of the next extent becomes a lot uglier than it
currently is. Currently it's just ->next->minimum, but with list.h, I'd
need container_of(current->list.next)->minimum. Or am I missing
something?
Regards,
Nigel
