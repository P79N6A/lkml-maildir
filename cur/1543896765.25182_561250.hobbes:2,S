Ok, I've got some documentation site, specifically 
http://kernel.org/doc
 (and 
I'll be completely redoing it as soon as I've recovered from my recent laptop 
crash and OLS).
Send me translations (preferably in HTML format), and I'll put 'em up.   (I've 
already got the one that started this thread.)
Thanks,
Rob
