I did try it, and sent a failure note to axp-list, yourself, and Jay.  Only Jay
responded, but it looks like something was busted in the driver as far as we
can tell.  Could very well have been that only Jay got the message - mail out
of Compaq was flaky at ZK that day, IIRC.
JSYK, it blew up when trying to scan the QLogic 1040B adapters in the system
for drives, complaining of SCSI command timeouts.  This is both with the driver
in 2.3.42 and the one that was in the vger CVS tree at around the time you sent
out your -2 patch.  If someone can point me to a qlogicisp driver that they
believe works correctly, I'll give them an answer if I get it before the end of
the day today.  (Have to give up the system for other testing for a week at the
end of the day.)  Anyone?
