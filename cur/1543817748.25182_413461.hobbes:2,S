I think you're thinking of Jake's genetic algorithms (separate patch). They 
tune the zaphod scheduler but bear in mind the limitation of such an 
algorithm is they can only tune for one workload which means that if you have 
two workloads running concurrently with different requirements, the other 
will suffer.

I'm curious. How do you think different schedulers per cpu would be useful?
