Yes there is a issue with a lot of apps dying, especially the
gnome-power-* apps which means my power management fails to work
frequently.  I'm on Git-10 currently and I'm going to patch it up to
date right now because it looks like there have been some memory remap
patches lately.  I will update the list after I do so.

This report is a bit mysterious.  I assume you're referring to x86's
	"%s%s[%d]: segfault at %lx ip %08lx sp %08lx error %lx"
printk in the kernel logs?
Can you please send some examples of the log output?
Is there actually any observeable problem apart from the logs?  Are
applications dying where they previously did not?
Thanks.
