Subject: [PATCH] Fix big endian ext2 bmap in 2.2.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/9/19/188

This patch fixes an obvious bug introduced with the ext2 changes in 2.2.18pre
(look up the definition of le32_to_cpu on BE machines without a special
assembler version for it and on machines that have it)
Patch against 2.2.18pre9
