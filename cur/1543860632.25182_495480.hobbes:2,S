I suspect it should be rather trivial to get this started.  As a first
step we simply add a
struct iodesc {
	int nr_segs;
	struct iovec ioc[]
};
And then we can add fields where nessecary.  First a full_length one
to avoid the loops to calculate thw whole I/O size, then flags for
the alignment check, etc..
