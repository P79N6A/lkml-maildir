If that is the case then we should always be guaranteed a timer interrupt due to the implementation of the dynamic tick.

Currently, the variable, "max_delta_ns", is defined as a 32-bit type (long) and for most architectures, if not all, this is configured by calling function "clockevent_delta2ns()". The maximum value that "max_delta_ns" can be assigned by calling clockevent_delta2ns(), is LONG_MAX (0x7fffffff). In nanoseconds the value 0x7fffffff equates to ~2.15 seconds. Hence, the maximum sleep time is ~2.15 seconds and at a minimum we should have at least 1 timer interrupt every ~2.15 seconds.

Agreed. timer interrupt with its max_delta will avoid the situation I
was thinking above.

max_delta would depend on the timer in the platform. With HPET this
should be much larger than 2.15 secs.

Yes. The initial deferrable timer was done only for tv1 group on
purpose. To keep things simpler and that would catch most of the "small"
timers and avoid them.

Ok. ﻿Thinking about it a bit more, I think we can push this patch along.
Thomas/Andrew, can one of you pick up this patch..
Thanks,
