Indeed. Andrew's recent patch greatly improved the situation.
Recently we exchanged half a dozen letters. I have good hopes
that in the near future *parted will improve a bit more.

Well. In case you reveal precisely which tools you are thinking of,
I am quite willing to contribute what I can to improve them.

Again. You shout with capital letters, but it is more productive to do.
In case you reveal the purposes not-to-be-discussed-now of these anonymous
tools, then again, I am quite willing to contribute what I can.
My email address is aeb@cwi.nl. Maybe parted is being worked on.
We can discuss everything else that you think needs fixing.

You have not convinced me. The change is over two years old.
Let us first discuss all these tools that may need fixing.

[Note that as it turns out there are situations involving a RAID
where one needs to know where the last cylinder starts. Funny.
This forces the kernel to have ideas about geometry at least for
that case.]
[Note that we saw last week that nowadays one meets FAT filesystems
with zero geometry fields that are reported to work fine with
Windows XP. Also Microsoft is trying to get away from this
geometry nonsense.]
