I believe that the requirement which fuse_allow_task() attempts to satisfy
is legitimate and is useful to FUSE users.
The fact that, AFAIK, nobody as found a way to implement it more nicely is
a Linux problem, not a FUSE problem.
Given that the actual amount of code involved is small, centralised and
well known about we can easily fix it up later if/when new infrastructure
or new ideas become available.
So unless someone is able to come up with a better approach in the next few
days I'm inclined to say "we suck" and merge the thing as-is.
However, a few things:
- is there anything in the current implementation of the permission stuff
  which might tie our hands if it is later reimplemented?  IOW: does the
  current FUSE user interface in any way lock us into the current FUSE
  implementation (fuse_allow_task())?
- the fuse mount options don't seem to be documented
- aren't we going to remove the nfs semi-server feature?
- Frank points out that a user can send a sigstop to his own setuid(0)
  task and he intimates that this could cause DoS problems with FUSE.  More
  details needed please?
- I don't recall seeing an exhaustive investigation of how an
  unprivileged user could use a FUSE mount to implement DoS attacks against
  other users or against root.
