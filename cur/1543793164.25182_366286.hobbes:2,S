They miss a completely undefined amount of fixes.
Consider e.g. the case that 2.6.16 contains fixes that are later 
identified as possible security issues.
The 2.6.16->2.6.16.1 patch fixes bugs in 2.6.16 - trying to apply it to 
a 2.6.15 kernel might both leave security holes and add new breakages.

There is no last dot-release - and it wouldn't help.
If you are running ftp.kernel.org kernels you have to upgrade to the 
latest one or you will definitely miss security fixes.
If this is a problem for you stay with distribution kernels - 
distributions offer exactly the service of security fixes for their 
kernels for a well-defined amount of time.
