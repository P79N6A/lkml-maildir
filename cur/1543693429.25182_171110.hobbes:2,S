FWIW, Linus released Linux before it was announced that BSD was going
to be free.  I am sure that had there been a free BSD around, then
Linus would not have bothered.  The question then becomes should Linus
and everyone else have just quit and waited for BSD to arive.  I dont really
know how to objectivly answer that question.  However I do remember
the state of Linux when the BSD announcement happened.  It seemed like
it was so close to being "done" that it didnt make sense to quite and
throw all that work away.  Everyone was saying 1.0 by Christmas.
It ended up being a lot more work than people imagined.  A couple of
Christmases past before 1.0 happened.
