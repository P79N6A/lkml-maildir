That sounds about right.  Before installing new mapping, kernel should
ensure there are no stale contents in caches or TLB.
lazy_mmu_prot_update needs to be called whenever the permissions on pte
(about to) change.  So if remapping is causing change in protection then
lazy_mmu_prot_update needs to be called.

Yup.

Right.  Extra flush_icache_page routines will add cost to archs that
have non-null definition of this routine.  BTW, isn't flush_icache_page
marked for deprecation?

lazy_mmu_prot_update was added specifically for notifying change in
protection.  So, in a way it is closer to update_mmu_cache (Which is for
change in mappings itself).  Though for ia64 implementation, this ends
up flushing the icaches when needed.
Hopefully my reply is useful.
