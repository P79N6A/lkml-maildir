Been there, tried that, had been told by Richard that he would rather fix
devfs bugs himself.  Quite a few months ago.  If you have better suggestions
they would be more than welcome.
As far as I can see, if maintainer doesn't fix the bugs himself and tells
that patches are not welcome there are only two things that can be done -
going into full-disclosure mode in hope that it will change the situation or
taking over the code in question.
By that point I'm sorely tempted to do the latter (i.e. full-blown fork,
maintained with no regard to Richard's preferences + sumbitting [very
massive] fixes directly to Linus), but I want to give a try to less
drastic approach first.
