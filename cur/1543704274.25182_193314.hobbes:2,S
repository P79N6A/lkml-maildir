I know it feels like a kick in the pants when your BogoMIPS drops to
leves not seen since the 80s, but the value you are getting is expected.
Since the patch above uses the pmtmr for __delay(), loops_per_jiffies is
then calibrated to the ACPI PM timer's frequency instead of aproximately
the cpu's freq. 
This was necessary, because on some systems calibrate_dealy()
incorrectly calibrates delays. Your system shows this, but its your
cycle based delay (clock=tsc) which is overestimated, so you see no
problem. The case Andrew describes above is when the loop based delay
(clock=pit or clock=pmtmr w/o this patch) is under estimated causing
problems when we initialize the APIC timer.  
Additionally, since we're no longer dependent on the cpu speed,
speedstep like changes to the cpu freqency no longer affects time.
