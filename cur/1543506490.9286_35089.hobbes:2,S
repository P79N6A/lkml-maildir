Afraid, I do not quite understand what you mean.
Currently, I have 7 connections stuck in CLOSE_WAIT for minutes now and
my proposed work-around does not work any more :-(
I was doing the following loop at the end of my ip-up script to keep the
line alive as long as there were unfinished connections:
while netstst -n|grep tcp; do
	ping -c 5 $peerip
	sleep 5
done
That worked for most of the time. Currently, it aviods taking the line
down... I often got connctions hanging around for some time after the
initiating app has exited, but they all went away in a minute or so
(also a very long time I think).
I just checked ping -f to $peerip, but that does not help :-(
I'm getting depressed now ...
Marc
