Right.  The problem is that the memory never seems to get freed no 
matter what I do.  I've tried setting /proc/sys/vm/vfs_cache_pressure to 
10000, but after a few days all my programs are running out of swap and 
I have to reboot to get things back to a usable state.

OK I just rebuilt 2.6.22.3 with SLAB and I seem to be getting the same 
result..obviously I haven't waited several days, but 
sysfs_dir_cache/dentry/inode_cache grow continuously when scanbuttond is 
running, and stop growing when it isn't.

Yes, I don't know enough to understand why this would affect 
sysfs_dir_cache, but there definitely seems to be a connection.
Thanks for the help,
