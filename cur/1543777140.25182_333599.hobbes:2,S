Subject: [PATCH/SCRIPT] reiserfs: run scripts/Lindent on reiserfs code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/12/375

The attached script runs scripts/Lindent against fs/reiserfs.c and
include/linux/reiserfs_*.h
It's a quick one-liner consisting of:
scripts/Lindent fs/reiserfs/*.c include/linux/reiserfs_*.h
