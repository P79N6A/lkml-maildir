Sure.  Under low load, cache is great.  Under stress, keeping it is
not an option though ;-)  We're at or beyond capacity and moving at
a high delda V (people yammering for help).  If you can recognize and
kill the delta rapidly by dumping that which you are going to have
to dump anyway, you save time getting back on your feet.  (my guess
as to why dumping clean pages does measurably help in this case)
