I had the same problem of shifting down along the mail chain the knowledge of
the incoming IP address.
We develop VirusScreening and ContentFiltering MTA ( and appliances ) that
usually goes in front of customers MTA.
By putting our MTA in front of the customer MTAs chain We hide the peer IP
address to MTAs that comes next in the mail chain.
Our MTA uses a new ESMTP command :
XRMTIP remote-ip-address
to let customers MTA to know the remote IP address and let them to take all
relay and generic permissions decisions about the mail path.
We're going to distribute patches for most common MTAs like qmail, sendmail,
exim, XMail and postfix.
The patch rely on the presence of a file ( /etc/xrmtip.hosts ) that list the IPs
from which the XRMTIP command sould be accepted.
