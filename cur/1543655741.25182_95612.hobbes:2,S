Hey 00ber-geeks,
I'm not subscribed (yet....still too lazy to subscribe ;P ), but I have a
question and/or suggestion.
Is there a system call that would destroy a process?  Sometimes I end up with
zombie processes, other times I end up with a process attaching to a device
driver, and hanging, so I want to be able to completely destroy the
process...image, file handle, driver hooks, everything.  If there isn't one,
and noone wants to do it, I'll gladly do it (may take a few weeks tho).  I just
don't wanna do what someone else has already done.
Thanks,
Justin Hibbits
