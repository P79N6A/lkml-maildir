Hi,
When using xconfig (not menuconfig), the drivers/MTD menu
needs some help IMO, but it's not clear where/why.
Before the patch, there was only "Memory Technology
Devices (MTD)" in the left xconfig panel.  After the patch,
under that heading there are 4 other MTD entries,
which are in the right-side panel before the patch and should
remain there.  These are:
  RAM/ROM/Flash chip drivers
  Mapping drivers for chip access
  Self-contained MTD device drivers
  NAND Flash Device support
