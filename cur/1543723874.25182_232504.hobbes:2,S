That's correct for ia64.  The architecture does not support an
"execute-only at all privilege levels" protection per se, so this
behavior is the easiest (most efficient) to implement.  If we really
cared about the "read execute-only at kernel-level", we could use
"probe" instructions in the __access_ok() macro to verify (user-level)
access permission.
