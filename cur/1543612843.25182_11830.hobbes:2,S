Marcelo,
The attached is a fix originally by Andrew Morton and discovered by the
preempt-kernel patch.  It is in Alan's tree but was never merged into
Linus's.
There is a race between con_close and con_flush_chars. 
n_tty_receive_buf writes to the tty queue and then flushes it via
con_flush_chars.  If the console closes in between these operations,
con_flush_char barfs.
Please, for all that is righteous, apply.
