Just an aside, it is hard to get 2.6 "on par" with 2.4 because 2.6 is
often much fairer (although it can still be badly unfair - if we ever
want to fix that we'd probably need per process mm).
There are quite a lot sorts of low memory situations you can get into.
My (and Nikita's) patches don't help the one you're probably in. They
don't put more pressure on slab.
