I had a very similar experience. In my case it turned out that for some
reason no UDP packets above 5524 would come through (try pinging with
larger than default packet sizes). The solution was to restrict NFS to
5000 (actually 4096) size packets. I have not been able to figure out the
cause of this yet. (and yes, tcpdump was able to see them fine).
