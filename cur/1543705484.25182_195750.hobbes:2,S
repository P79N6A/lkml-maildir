I'm sorry, it's my mistake. With the last patch (ppc_up.diff that you
sent on sunday) it works with vanilla 2.6.1. I've tried to merge this
patch with benh's tree but probably I've made some errors. 
Unfortunately I can't use vanilla kernel: it lacks some features that I
need. 
Have you planned to make any patches against benh's tree?
Bye,
marco
