I took a look at this today and figured Id document it:
http://ozlabs.org/~anton/linux/sysbench/
Bottom line: it looks like issues in the glibc malloc library, replacing
it with the google malloc library fixes the negative scaling:
# apt-get install libgoogle-perftools0
# LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libtcmalloc.so /usr/sbin/mysqld
