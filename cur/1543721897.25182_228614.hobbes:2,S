Ok, heres a summary of the problems we have (feel free to add any more problems).
We have two types of "device": single function devices and 'system on chip' devices which have multiple functions.
Single chip devices may be able to either access system memory directly, or may only be able to access their internal SRAM pool. in the case of the latter the system can either directly access the SRAM or not, depending on the device/bus setup. Its possible the devices may have more than one non-continuous SRAM mapping.
The same goes for SOC devices, however they could come in two 'classes'. In one type, we would essentially have multiple independant devices in a single chip. In another case (which appears to be fairly common) we can have multiple devices sharing a common SRAM pool. its also possible to have some devices sharing the pool and some having their own in the same chip.
Can anyone describe another type of chip we need to accomodate?
