Well, I need to clarify the question.
I would like to determine the banwidth the card is getting from
the network. 
For an ethernet, it could be either 10Mbps or 100Mbps, is there any
way of knowing from inside the kernel how much is the bandwidth the
card is actually receiving from the network, especially when it is capable of
getting either 10Mbps or 100Mbps?
