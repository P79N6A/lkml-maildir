What's the purpose of the "&& order == 0)" test for MPOL_INTERLEAVE in 
alloc_pages_current?
What would break if it's removed?
And what about in_interrupt() allocations? During boot everything should 
be interleaved - I'd modify default_policy to MPOL_INTERLEAVE instead of 
setting process affinity.
