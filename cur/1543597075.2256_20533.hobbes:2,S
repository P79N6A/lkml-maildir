Very cool.  Thanks for doing a no-scan implementation of /dev/poll!
Two questions:
1) have you compared its performance against Vitaly Luban's 
signal-per-fd patch?  Even though it's realtime-signal based,
there's some hope for it being quite efficient.  See
http://www.luban.org/GPL/gpl.html
 and
http://boudicca.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/2001week20/1353.html
2) A little birdie told me that someone had gotten a freebsd
box to handle something like half a million connections.
I would like to see you extend the horizontal axis of your graph
by a couple orders of magnitude :-)
Thanks,
Dan
p.s. I have updated

with a link to your report.
