The problem you are discussing now is completely different to what we
were originally discussing, and almost completely pointless.
Of course you get problems if a raw devices changes underneath a
mounted filesystem, I would expect that.  That is _NOT_ what we were
talking about _AT ALL_.  The point is that the device itself caches
the state of the disc over an erase, so even if the device is
unmounted before an erase, when it is re-mounted, the stale data is
read from the device's own cache, which should have been invalidated
by the erase.
