Well bigsmp wasnt going to go away anytime soon so the de-subarching and 
unification work had to be done anyway. NUMAQ came along for the ride ;-) 
I've got some more restructuring plans in this area so the time was well 
spent in any case.

Yes, unless there's major stability problems with the x86/apic branch 
we'll merge it into v2.6.30. NUMAQ is a single .c module now 
(default-disabled) so not much of a concern.
