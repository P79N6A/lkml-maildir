That doesn't sound right, Alan...
The constant in question is an upper-limit to the range of device versions
what get accepted.  Narrowing the range can only break things -- making it
wider may not (necessarily) fix anything, but it does increase the scope of
the entry.
I'm guessing that someone meant to change it from something smaller than
either Andries' or the current value to where it is now, but the larger
value (i.e. Andries') is the proper one.
