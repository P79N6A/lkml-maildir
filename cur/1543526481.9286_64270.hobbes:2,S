No, because it doesn't know types. The kernel is full of
foo->ops->bar() calls, and it's really a pain to unwind those
calling sequences.
(Of course, LXR has a flat name space, so there are plenty of
other things that it doesn't know either. Structs full of
function pointers are just a particularly interesting example.)
Also, it doesn't have views. Example: try to find out how
prio_dequeue at
http://lxr.linux.no/source/net/sched/sch_prio.c?v=2.3.45#L108
may be called. Worse yet, find what gets called at
http://lxr.linux.no/source/net/ipv4/tcp_output.c?v=2.3.45#L193
and where this is set. (Okay, this is a trick example - I'm not
sure why it LXR didn't index queue_xmit).
LXR is certainly a nice tool, but it pretty far away from the
thing I'm looking for.
