	Actually nothing SMP specific in that problem sphere.
	Alpha has  load-locked/store-conditional  pair for
	this type of memory accesses to automatically detect,
	and (conditionally) restart the operation - to form
	classical  ``locked-read-modify-write'' operations.
	In what situations the compiler will use those instructions,
	that I don't know.   Volatiles, very least, use them.
	Will closely packed bytes be processed with it without
	them being volatiles ?  How about bitfields ?
	Newer Alphas have byte/short load/store instructions,
	so things really aren't that straight-forward...
