I've just opened the case to install some more RAM and
noticed that the SATA controller card wasn't completely
fitted into the PCI slot.  Could it be just a hardware
problem?  I don't know what that assartion is about.
Nowadays, Fedora kernels don't differ much from stock
kernels plus the usual bugfixes.  I've now upgraded to
2.6.13-1.1555-FC5 because it fixes an iptables bug.
I'll report if I see this bug again.

This is happening on our production server, and there are no
other computers next to it, so I can't easily hook in a
serial cable.
