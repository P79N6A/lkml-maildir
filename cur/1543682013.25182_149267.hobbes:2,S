What sort of logic is that !!!
The ONLY reason I can think of for treating a speaker as an INPUT
device is if that speaker is wired up in a way that allows it to
be used as a microphone, the way some baby-intercoms do. If this
is the reason, then don't expect any sort of quality from it, and
please also separate this use from the more conventional one.
Best wishes from Riley.
