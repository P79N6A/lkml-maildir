Greetings, I have a few questions regarding kernel module programming, if
you don't mind.
The first question is: is any other way to get reference to
`struct module' pointing to myself, but getting the reference from
__this_module? The drawback of this thing is that it isn't implemented in
2.0.X kernels.  In k.2.0.X get_module_symbol could probably be used, which
performs lookups by symbolic name. But I am kinda stuck with it..
The other question is: if there's a way to call the other
iternal kernel pieces from within a module, like find_module and stuff..?
(yeah, I know, I could just fetch address from System_map and declare it as
(int )(*find_module)(params)=0x....; but there should be more elegant way to
do this, no?
