I agree.  IMO user space should not be considered as available once we have
started freezing processes, so hotplug should be disabled before.  By the same
token, it should only be enabled after the processes have been restarted
during resume (or after suspend has failed).
BTW, it seems to me that the forking of new processes could be disabled
before we start to freeze the existing ones.

I think the drivers that need the hotplug to resume should defer their resume
routines until usermodehelper is enabled (it seems to me that we can use
a completion to handle this).
