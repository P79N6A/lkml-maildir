Run a small shell check and let it fail if the shell stuff errors.
The fragment you want is
if [ -e /bin/rpm ]; then
        X=`rpm -q gcc`
        if [ "$X" = "gcc-2.96-54" ]; then
                echo "*** GCC 2.96-54 will miscompile Reiserfs. Please update your compiler"
                echo "See 
http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHBA-2000-132.html"
                exit 255
        fi
fi

Grin. gcc 3.0 is going to be just as much fun Im sure, but finally should give
everyone a stable C and more importantly C++ base including the LSB standards.
