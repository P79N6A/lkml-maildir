 The change decreases performance a bit.  For well-behaved systems the
loss is fifteen instructions: a local APIC read (uncached but supposedly
cheap), a global memory read (a cache line invalidation and fetch), seven
stack accesses (cached for sure), a taken branch and five ALU.  With the
version you have I see gcc is actually doing an extra memory read due to
the volatile APIC access presumably -- this is now fixed.
 For misdelivered interrupts the overhead is much, much bigger, involving
acquiring a spinlock and multiple (uncached and possibly slow) I/O APIC
accesses.  We may lower the overhead by undefining APIC_LOCKUP_DEBUG,
which we should do after a bit of testing.  I think we might leave
APIC_MISMATCH_DEBUG intact -- its cost is a single locked instruction
which is negligible IMO.
 Note the original version consisted of two instructions only -- a local
APIC write and "ret", sigh...
