Santiago,
Thanks for the excellent bug report.
Is this perhaps the same problem as described here?
    
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5839
It sounds similar but I only skimmed over your report.
If you think it is, could you add (just cut/paste)
you email to that bug for me?
Could you also try the patch I attached to that bug report?
If it works for you, we can both pester Kyle McMartin to
push it upstream. ;)
Thanks for the excellent bug report...I'll take a closer look
at it later this week or weekend.
thanks,
grant
