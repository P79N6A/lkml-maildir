why are you using a rwsem here? rw semaphores are *expensive*. Really
expensive. Might well not be worth it unless you expect really frequent
readers compared to writers *and* long hold times. Can you give an idea
about how frequent the reader case is?
(and if it's really frequent, wouldn't RCU be a better solution?)
