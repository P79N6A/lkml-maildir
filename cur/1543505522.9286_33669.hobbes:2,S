Dear hackers,
I have made a patch since 2.2pre7 that significantly updates the 
kernel time keeping. Specifically it presents virtual nanosecond 
resolution and extreme fine tuning of clock drifts.
The adjtimex function had been changed, but only very few, highly 
specialized applications would require recompilation.
The last release of the patch was "PPSkit-0.7.0" for Linux-2.2.9, and 
that version runs extremly fine on i386: One machine running for 
weeks keeps time within 5ms; that's quite fine for an old 
i386SX/16MHz with a WD8013 LAN card and an nnon-enhanced IDE 
harddrive using the old XT disk driver, don't you agree?
At home my Pentium-100 runs with an accurace of less than 1us.
Unfortunately I can't validate other architectures. Specifically the 
code to interpolate between ticks has to be adapted (if it was too 
much assembler or too hardware-specific). I did as much of the work 
as I was aware, but in the past nobody seemed to care. The other part 
that needs attention is reading and updating the battery-buffered 
clock of the hardware.
Yesterday I successfully validated the patch for Linux-2.2.11.
Now the question is: Can this patch be a candidate for 2.4???
If so, do I need to get the most recent 2.3.x kernel and merge my 
patch into it, or will someone else try it.
Anyway, people are invited to send updates for PPSkit-0.7.0 (if 
required), and others please wait for the next release that should be 
available real soon (either as 0.7.1 or 0.8.0, depending on some 
information I don't have yet).
As I'm not subscribed to this list, please send feedback CC'd to me.
Thank you.
Ulrich
