Alan is correct.
The "Digi RightSwitch" product did actually make it out to the real
world.
Its basically a NIC card with a built-in switch, back when switches
actually
cost $$$.
Obviously its been commoditized in the marketplace to the point where
its
basically worthless now. =)
There were not that many produced or sold, and got "killed" pretty
quick here at Digi.
I know Digi as a company would not care if the driver "went away" from
the
kernel sources as the product hasn't been sold in many many years...
However, there *might* actually still be users for said driver...
Its just hard to say.
