Guess I'm confused about this then. Are you suggesting putting the pcibr_dma files
into the pci_dma.c code and not having a pcibr_dma interface ?? The api is there because
pcibr is an ASIC and is ASIC specific.

How is this:
arch/ia64/sn/pci/
                  pci_dma.c
                  pci_extension.c
                  pcibr/
                      pcibr_ate.c
                      pcibr_dma.c
                      pcibr_provider.c
                      pcibr_reg.c
arch/ia64/sn/kernel/
                  bte_error.c
                  io_init.c
                  iomv.c
Since pcibr is an ASIC it makes sense for it to have its own directory. There are
other ASIC interfaces that will be put in in the not too distant future and they
will go in separate directories also.

I will inline free_ate_resource(), alloc_ate_resource() and ate_write(). I want to
keep the ate code in a separate file - since it is a group of functions with a similar
theme and is non-trivial.

Missed them - I'll take them out.

I'm confused on this too. The struct defs are for different MMR sets - so we do need
to use different types of pointers.

I'll move the sal_pcibr_rrb_alloc() code into snia_pcibr_rrb_alloc()

Sorry, missed this....

I'll fix this.

OK.

OK.

OK.

Missed these too.

I'll work on fixing this up.
