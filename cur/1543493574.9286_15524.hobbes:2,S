Hi
I realise that this is not the correct place to post requests
for information about Xfree86, but my question also relates to
the kernel to an extent, and so I considered it worth posting to
the kernel group.
I have two video cards (an AGP Banshee Voodoo2 - current, and
an S3 Trio64V PCI - old)
What I want (initially) is to be able to use both cards in my
machine simultaneousley - preferably both in X such that I can
run my program on one monitor, and my debugger on another.
I suppose that I would also love to be able to have X on one,
and a console on the other (preferably X on the Banshee, and
the console on the S3).
At some point, I would love it if I could run two consoles,
and I assume this is where the kernel would come into play,
perhaps using init to put consoles 1-6 on monitor0 and 7-12 on
monitor1 or something like that. If nothing else, my syslog on
one, and the rest on the other would be a nice compromise.
Any ideas etc on any of the above would be gratefully received
(direct to me) and any pointers on where to put XFree86 questions
would be nice.
Thanks
Daniel (Kinnison) Silverstone
