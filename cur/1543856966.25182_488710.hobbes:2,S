IMO it least at needs one more iteration to address the comments that 
were made (not just mine), in the short term the less it touches 
unconditionally the less I care right now.
In the long term IMO this might need a major rework, the basic problem I 
have is that I don't see how this usable beyond dynticks/hrtimer, e.g. how 
to dynamically manage multiple timer.
