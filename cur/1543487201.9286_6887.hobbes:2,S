By it's very nature, the standard Linus kernel doesn't contain "patches".

I do.  We don't necessarily need every little bug report for such a patch,
but discussion of its intent, design, and implementation is exactly what
linux-kernel is for, in my opinion.
Unofficial patches and test results thereof don't form a significant
amount of traffic on linux-kernel and aren't too difficult to find in a
big mail folder, if they are especially interesting.
In my opinion, if it's not big enough to need a list all to itself (new
fs, big fs/net/vm hacks) then linux-kernel is exactly the place for it.
The list might sometimes be hard to cope with, because there is lots of
discussion on it, but a lot of the discussion belongs there (and certainly
that which doesn't doesn't belong on your lists either).
It's a good list, and it works pretty well.  I don't claim any authority
(which is why I'm prepared to state my opinions on the matter) but I
consider trying to "poach" valid traffic from linux-kernel very
antisocial.
Matthew.
