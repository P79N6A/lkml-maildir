Look at the line right above it...  AFAICS you want 
pci_enable_device_mem(), if the mask is selecting IORESOURCE_MEM BARs.
Also a CC to linux-scsi and the driver author would be nice, as they are 
the ones with hardware and can verify.
This set of changes seemed like 50% guesswork to me, without consulting 
the authors :(  And unlike many changes, you actually have to know the 
hardware [or get clues from surrounding code] to make the change.
