They already are wrappers in filemap.c  In fact one of my planned projects
is to kill all that silly duplication and have aio_readv/aio_writev entry
points for filesystems and read/write for drivers and nothing else.  That
would cleanup the mess extremly.

I think that's okay.  XIP is a total minority feature, and while we should
avoid duolication where possible not making filemap.c even more messy is
by far preferable.
