I cannot find any code in the main tree that depends on this header
file.  Furthermore, I am somewhat skeptical of the algorithms.  Maybe
the first comment has scared people away:
    "The algorithms implemented here seem to be a completely new
    invention, and I'll publish the fundamentals in a paper."
It defines two generic hash table classes using C preprocessor macros,
a "fuzzy" hash and an ordinary hash.
The "fuzzy" hash class is useless without a description.  What does
find_hash_fuzzy do?
The ordinary hash class maintains an ring-ordered doubly-linked list
of entries for each hash synonym, and it performs a move-to-front
heuristic on insertion (but not for the find operation).  
The second and final comment ("HASHSIZE _must_ be a power of two!!!")
does not apply to the ordinary hash class.
Would anyone care defend either of these hash classes?
