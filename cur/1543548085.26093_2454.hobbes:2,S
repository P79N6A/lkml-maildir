Subject: [PATCH] change ifmap.base_addr to u_long type
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus,
Here is a small patch which is needed on non-i386 platforms.
base_addr in ifmap allows one to specify as a kernel boot argument the
base io addr of the net device.  It is currently defined as u_short. 
However, on a non-i386 platforms, this addr can be greater than what
u_short can represent.
ifmap.base_addr is mainly used to initialize net_device base_addr, which
is already a u_long.
This change does not increase the memory size for struct ifmap.
In the same spirit, ifmap.irq should probably be changed to u_int as
well, but that would increase the size, and I don't have the need yet.
:-)
