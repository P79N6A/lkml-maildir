No, ACPI is not required for interrupt sharing... So it might work ;-)

Have you tried my patch? I'm running a kernel with this patch, ACPI enabled 
and "pci=noacpi". 16 IRQ's won't be enough for me, too, as you can see here:
           CPU0
  0:     348795    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:        627    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  4:          5    IO-APIC-edge  serial
  8:          2    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
  9:          0    IO-APIC-edge  acpi
 14:      12240    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
 15:         11    IO-APIC-edge  ide1
 16:      31827   IO-APIC-level  nvidia
 17:       1461   IO-APIC-level  eth0
 18:          4   IO-APIC-level  bttv0
 19:      13213   IO-APIC-level  EMU10K1
 21:      11567   IO-APIC-level  uhci-hcd, uhci-hcd, uhci-hcd, ehci_hcd
And everything works just fine... (despite my broken BIOS ;-)
