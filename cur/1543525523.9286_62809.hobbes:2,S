Would it be better to use the __LITTLE_ENDIAN_BITFIELD and/or
__BIG_ENDIAN_BITFIELD that linux/include/asm/byteorder.h indirectly
gives you (thereby preventing a sprawling big long list of
#if defined(__arch1__) || defined(__arch2__)
type things)?
Have a look at drivers/block/ide-floppy.c for example usage.
