The thing is, that the irq handling is _too_ different on different
architectures. A lot of the problems, especially the SMP issues, are
simply completely architecture-independent.

It is. And I _know_ that just about every architecture except for the x86
has bugs when it comes to SMP handling. Some, like the 68k, do not need to
care.

There's absolutely nothing architecture-specific in <linux/irq.h>.
It may be _different_ than existing architectures, but I'll try to make
sure that future ports use the same correct irq handling, and I'll see if
I can port some of the existing stuff (notably alpha) to use the new
generic handling. It's actually very flexible - it pretty much has to be
in order to handle the different kinds of interrupt controllers that exist
on PC-like machines.
No architecture will be _forced_ to use the new stuff, so don't worry. But
I'll just warn you that you're likely to get the SMP stuff wrong if you
don't use it ;)
