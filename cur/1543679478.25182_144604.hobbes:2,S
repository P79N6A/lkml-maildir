I don't like knobs at all [1], but I have to ~agree with Felipe.
A prime candidate for a knob (rather switch) would be a slightly more sane 
back-boost for desktop use. I'm playing with back-boost in my tree, 
allowing a limited quantity, and strictly from user tasks... it helps the 
desktop quite a bit.  Another thing that's very important for the desktop 
(and shell) is startup time for new tasks.  I'm working on something there 
too (works great when it's not busy breaking everything to 
pieces;).  Modulo me ever getting that darn thing working acceptably well, 
another candidate is to either export CHILD_PENALTY as in scheduler knobs 
patch, or just set it to ~75-~85 when back-boost is enabled, ie make one 
desktop mode switch and hope like heck it doesn't cause more trouble than 
it's worth.

1.  Dear LKML, why does performance suck?  My .config and 10000 random knob 
settings attached.
