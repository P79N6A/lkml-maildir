Subject: bcm43xx not properly working with 2.6.19.1

Hi,
I filed this to the bugzilla, but all the documentation I read about the
kernel recommends posting to the mailing lists so here I go:
I'm using Ubuntu 6.06 and after booting with the 2.6.19.1 kernel from
kernel.org, the wireless card that uses bcm43xx driver does not work
properly. It fails with
sudo iwlist eth1 scan
 -> eth1: no scan results (even though there are many many ap's around)
The weird thing, after booting to Ubuntu's kernel, the card didn't work
either. I had to reboot to Windows, activate card and connect to an AP,
and then reboot back to Ubuntu's kernel to make it work properly.
I will probably not be able to test patches, as the bug disables the
card in a weird way (it scared the hell out of me).
I tried to provide all the information I could here:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7682
Please let me know if I can provide more input,
Thanks,
Sincerely.
PS. Please CC me on your replies, thanks :)
