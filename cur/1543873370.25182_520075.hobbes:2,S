There's also vDrift (racing sim), they added support very recently.
I plan to add it in my car sim too, but there's still nothing coded.
I have a question: if the force is to be 3D, why only 3 possible
values? What would they be, 3 torques or 3 forces? In the case of car
sims (ff steering wheels), only one axis of torque is usually used
(except for 6 dof platforms, as mentioned).
By the way, is this the correct list for asking trivial questions
(such as questions about how the ff api works), or is it only for
development of kernel?
(hope the mail arrives this time; the first one was apparently sent as
html, which is considered spam by the mailing list; and the
notification about that problem was considered spam by gmail too!)
