For s390 we have: stolen time == wanted to run but the hypervisor didn't
let us. The way this is implemented is by using the cpu timer. This is a
per-cpu register that is fully virtualized. It runs at the same rate as
the clock, but only if the virtual cpu is scheduled to run. If the real
cpu falls out of the guest context the guest cpu timer just stops. The
wall clock (TOD) keeps ticking. The calculation to find the amount of
stolen time is now simple: TOD clock - guest cpu timer.
For idle there is a little pitfall. If the guest cpu is a dedicated cpu
under LPAR loading a wait psw does not cause the guest cpu fall out of
the guest context. The guest cpu timer will continue ticking. In this
case the time spent in idle is accounted via system_time. If the guest
cpu is a shared cpu then loading a wait psw will cause the cpu to fall
out of guest context and the guest cpu timer will be stopped. In this
case the idle time will be accounted via steal_time.
