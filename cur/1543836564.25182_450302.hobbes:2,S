you are right that the interface to the HV should be stable. But those are going
to be specific to the HV, the paravirt_ops allows the kernel to smoothly deal
with having different HV's.
So in a way it's an API interface to allow the kernel to deal with multiple
different ABIs that exist today and will in the future.
