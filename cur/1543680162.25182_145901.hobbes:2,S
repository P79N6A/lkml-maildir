Subject: Unable to grab 2.5 tree via bkbits

I am trying to grab the kernel via bk but I am not able to find the
rigth directory. My first attempt was as follows:
>$ bk clone 
http://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5
 linux-2.5
Clone 
http://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5
 -> file://usr/src/linux-2.5
linux-2.5: No such file or directory
Yet when I when I viewed the hosted projects at www.bkbits.net I noticed
that there was a linus project for the kernel. So I tried that:
>$ bk clone 
http://linus.bkbits.net/linux-2.5
 linux-2.5
Clone 
http://linus.bkbits.net/linux-2.5
 -> file://usr/src/linux-2.5
linux-2.5: No such file or directory
So far I see no messages that alert me to a problem with bkbits.net so I
am suspecting the problem is on my end. Can someone show me the errors
of my ways?
Stephen
