Well, there are a couple of ext3 fixes that have just been merged into
Marcelo's bk tree, so you could try that and see if it helps.
However, I suspect it won't, because:

This suggests that e2fsck is finding new corruption each time it is
scanning the disk.  That sounds as if a hardware or driver-level
problem is more likely.  What sorts of errors are you getting from the
fsck passes?

One thing that would help would be to try a surface scan which writes
stuff to the disk and verifies it.  The "badblocks" code from e2fsck
can do that, but the most effective form of "badblocks" for such a
case is highly destructive to your data, so it's only useful if you
don't need to preserve the data already on the filesystem.

Unfortunately, if you disable UDMA mode, you also lose the checksums
between drive and controller which can detect cable data corruption.
Cheers,
