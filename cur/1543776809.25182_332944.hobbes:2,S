For #1/#2 add_timer_relative is an easy wrapper around add_timer for the
moment and I did play with that a bit. Never looked at the accuracy
stuff. In theory its a case of picking existing timeout points for low
resolution timers or tacking them onto an existing timeout that is near
enough. On the pratical side there area few problems with timer
