I think I've fixed the problem now. It wasn't that there were published 
records for stusta.de, the problem was that the mail server couldn't 
resolve your domain. For some reason everything from the DNS I'm using 
to your DNS gets dropped. The mail server takes the paranoid route and 
assumes the worst when it cannot contact dns servers (that's why you got 
a 4xx, not a 5xx). I've now changed DNS which will hopefully solve the 
issue.
As for dropping the mailing list out of MAINTAINERS then I'd prefer you 
didn't (of course). But I will not remove the filters on the servers 
since they remove a lot of spam. If that means it cannot be in 
MAINTAINERS, then so be it.
