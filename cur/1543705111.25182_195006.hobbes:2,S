Subject: 2.6.2-rc2 (BK): /proc/bus/input/devices information for joystick bogus?

Hi,
I see this in /proc/bus/input/devices:
I: Bus=0014 Vendor=0001 Product=000f Version=0100
N: Name="Analog 3-axis 4-button joystick"
P: Phys=<NULL>/input0
H: Handlers=js0 
B: EV=b 
B: KEY=1b 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
B: ABS=83 
The <NULL> tag seems to confuse hotplug's input.rc. Where does it come
from? How can the kernel see the Joystick without knowing the phys
address?
(This was also filed as SourceForge.net bug #887724 to the linux-hotplug
project.)
TIA,
