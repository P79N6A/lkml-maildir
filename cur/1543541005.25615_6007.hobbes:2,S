Our situation here is that we have several groups based on clients.  Each
client is a group and has several users in that group.  Likewise we have an
internal support group for each client which also consists of several users.
In addition to this we have certain processes (PGP, and others) that need to
cross both groups to move data & encrypt it.  No one in any group should
have ownership authority for the directories.  Only user associated to the
'system' tasks (like PGP) should have access to all groups.  Internal users
should have access to their own group files as well as files to only the
clients that they support.
The problem rises when some clients have sub-vendors that need to be part of
that client's group but are not allowed to
see any other sub-vendor's data.  But all internal and the client can see
that data.  It's a convoluted system to really describe in a
post but groups are the best way I can think of handling all the iterations.
However the limits of groups is what is killing me now.
Since most of the access to this system in non-interactive (handled by FTP,
or daemon processes) in chrooted environments
most user-based solutions (sudu, et al) get sticky or
non-usable/maintainable.
The post that Frank came up with patching the kernel & glibc seems to be the
best route.  I'm trying to aquire a PC system
to test it on this week.  If all goes well it will be in production shorly
after.
