Since XFS also does not free preallocated space on error and this
behavior is inline with dd, posix_fallocate() and the current ext4
implementation, do we still need FA_FL_FREE_ENOSPC flag ?

Will the FA_MKSWAP mode still be required with your suggested change of
teaching do_mpage_readpage() about unwritten extents being in place ?
Or, will you still like to have FA_MKSWAP mode ?
