Hi.
I have an old recycled box playing firewall for me which stubbornly 
refuses to run 2.4.  2.2.17,18,19,20 and a handful of -pre* patches have 
run just fine.
The system just hangs after 2.4 prints out:
SIS5513: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 09
SIS5513: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0x4000-0x4007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0x4008-0x400f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
hda: Maxtor 90320D2, ATA DISK drive
hdb: CD-ROM CDU76E, ATAPI CDROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
2.2 continues fine.  But 2.4 appears to hang here forever.  No panic, no 
keyboard control, C-A-D does nothing.
hda: Maxtor 90320D2, 3079MB w/256kB Cache, CHS=782/128/63
Partition check:
 hda: hda1 hda2 hda3
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Relevant system specs:
Cyrix 233MHz processor
64M PC-100 RAM (1 dimm)
SIS5513 IDE chipset
    LSPCI reports: 00:01.1 IDE interface: Silicon Integrated Systems 
[SiS] 5513 [IDE] (rev d0)
I have the kernel built for a 386, PCI and EISA support enabled (and 
their respective PNP) all Y, SIS5513 support included in the kernel... 
 What am I missing, here?
More information available if needed.
Thanks in advance,
--Nathan
