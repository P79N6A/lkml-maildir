When your server fails to work as per spec, then it is said to be
"broken" no matter what kernel/nfs-utils combination you are using.
The spec is that reboots are not supposed to clobber filehandles.
So, there are 3 possibilities:
 1) You are exporting a non-supported filesystem, (e.g. FAT). See the
FAQ on 
http://nfs.sourceforge.org
.
 2) A bug in your initscripts is causing the table of exports to be
clobbered. Running "exportfs" in legacy 2.4 mode (without having the
nfsd filesystem mounted on /proc/fs/nfsd) appears to be broken for me at
least...
 3) There is some other bug in knfsd that nobody else appears to be
seeing.
Cheers,
  Trond
