SATA 150 and SATA 300 refers to interface speed (1.5Gbps or 3Gbps). 
Unless its entirely flash-based or RAM-based, it is highly unlikely that 
your disk max out the SATA cable bandwidth.
There is "SATA II is x times faster" rule, because it depends on the 
drive mechanics inside.  A SATA II drive may be exactly the same speed 
as SATA I, except that it is upgraded to support NCQ and other SATA II 
features.
NCQ definitely helps.
