OK, who was it this time?  Andi?
If a.out indeed needs to call arch_setup_additional_pages() then the
correct way to fix this is to rip the festering dungpile which we have now
and:
- Give i386, x86_64, powerpc and sh a new
  CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_SETUP_ADDITIONAL_PAGES
- Create a new include/linux/interp.h which has:
	struct linux_binprm;
	#ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_SETUP_ADDITIONAL_PAGES
	extern int arch_setup_additional_pages(struct linux_binprm *bprm,
                                       int executable_stack);
	#else
	static inline int arch_setup_additional_pages(struct linux_binprm *bprm,
                                       int executable_stack)
	{
		return 0;
	}
	#endif
- include <linux/interp.h> from binfmt_elf.c and binfmt_aout.c and from
  all the files which implement arch_setup_additional_pages().  
- Remove the #ifdef ARCH_HAS_SETUP_ADDITIONAL_PAGES from binfmt_elf.c
- Add the call to arch_setup_additional_pages() in binfmt_aout.h.
