Well the process list has been very short. So I am pretty sure that 
there hasn't been any processes from the application.
Could it be that the socket which first belongs to the crashed 
application is bound to the father process of this crashed application?
This would be a bash or init.
Thanks for the hint with fuser.
Before the next reboot I will try to reproduce and will use the fuser 
command to see more details.
Bye
