Kernel headers are _not_ a library of random crap for userspace to use.
There is no justification for asm/atomic.h being installed
in /usr/include. Especially since, as Arjan points out, it doesn't
actually provide atomic operations in many cases anyway.
However, the kernel is released under a licence which allows you to
re-use code from it if you really want. If you want to provide a
'libkernelstuff', the GPL permits you to do that. The kernel's ABI
headers (and lkml) are not the appropriate place for such a project
though. If you want to do that, take it where the C++ and microkernel
people go.
Btw, your mail client omitted the References: and In-Reply-To: headers
which RFC2822 says it SHOULD have included. On a list with as much
traffic as linux-kernel, that's _very_ suboptimal, because you've
detached your message from the thread to which you replied. Please try
to fix or work around that.
