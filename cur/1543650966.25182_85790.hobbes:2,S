But then would you agree seeing anybody, and I mean anybody, coming along 
with a "good idea" for alteration to the Washington Monument and let them do 
what they want?

It is _his_ copy of the kernel, just as you have your own copy.
Linus' tree is known to be the main reference tree, no more.
If your patch is so valuable (and I don't mean it's not), you should be able
to convince vendors to include it in their own tree.  If _then_ it happens
to be a major feature with a large user base I'm sure it'll make the
reference tree.  But in the mean time a few scattered users isn't enough.
