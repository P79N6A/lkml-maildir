Yes. So boot cpu code in setup.S is also doing these checks. So one 
of the options is that I create a new file says verify_cpu.S and this
code can be shared by setup.S, trampoline.S and wakeup.S.
Or, I can simply drop the verify_cpu bit from trampoline.S and wakeup.S.
This looks like a non-essential bit and in the past we did not perform
these checks in trampoline.S and wakeup.S
At this point of time, I will prefer to go with second option of dropping
extended checks in trampoline.S and wakeup.S to keep things simple.
Does that make sense?
Thanks
Vivek
