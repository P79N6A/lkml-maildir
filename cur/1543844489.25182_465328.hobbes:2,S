At least they would be dumping on top of "mostly working".
I kind of like that.  It breeds more confidence into the
tree having been working before the dump took place, thus
making the isolation of cause much easier.

Having odd/even rules kind of adds legitimacy to the per-tree folks
doing the same.  This avoids situations like "why is XXX being an
asshole with his tree, when there are other trees merging new
features this round?".  Having buy-in from everyone is very useful
and gets folks in the correct mindset.
