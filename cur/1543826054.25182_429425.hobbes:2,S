What manner of device does it connect? I'm sure I've seen GSM phones
which seem to be something like pl2302 when you connect to them with
USB... and with a phone, you can dial up to a remote system and use
xmodem.
You also get to test the flow control, since if you're using a 9600 baud
dialup connection and your 'serial' link is faster than that, it'll need
to be throttled.
