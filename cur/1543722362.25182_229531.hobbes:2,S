Most hardware got better for this problem with s7.1. There is a new release that
addressed a few bugs only just announced on lkml (staircase 7.3) which seemed
to fix this problem on machines tested so far. This should address these
issues.
Note that at very high loads mainline will be more responsive, but it does this
to the detriment of fairness which I decided was not worth pursuing in
staircase. The machine should will be usable at these very high loads - which
is important when a box goes out of control - but it will not be as smooth as
mainline.
Thanks for feedback.
Cheers,
Con
