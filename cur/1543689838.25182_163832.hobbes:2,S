Sure there is interest:)

But how can I check the damn things work ? Sensors writers seem to 
have eschewed the nice messages every other driver writer put in dmesg to
tell me their stuff is correctly loaded.
For example I have :
"SMBus Via Pro adapter at 5000"
in "/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:11.0/i2c-3/name" so I suppose via-pro
at least is loaded (fully ?). Which should be the bus stuff I think. For
the chip stuff that would be VIA686A (?) But how am I supposed to check the 
darn thing works with nothing in dmesg ? I've already combed sysfs for clues 
and found nothing.
