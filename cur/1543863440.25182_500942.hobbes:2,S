Subject: [PATCH] videobuf_qbuf: fix? possible videobuf_queue->stream corruption and lockup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I am pretty sure the bug is real, but the patch may be wrong, please review.
We are doing ->buf_prepare(buf) before adding buf to q->stream list. This
means that videobuf_qbuf() should not try to re-add a STATE_PREPARED buffer.
