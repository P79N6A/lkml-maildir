minor thing:
WARNING: line over 80 characters
#88: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:759:
+               put_unaligned(cpu_to_be16(blocks), (unsigned short *) &pc->c[7]);
seems like it can be fixed by removing space between '(unsigned short *)'
and '&pc->c[7]'
otherwise looks good, please move it at the beginning of the patch series
PS I need some sleep so the rest of patches have to wait till tomorrow...
