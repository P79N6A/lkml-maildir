I confirm this. I have two types of gkrellm reports:
28C CPU temperature/0% CPU load
31C CPU temperature/50% CPU load system
(well, in the average :-)
In the latter case I see kapm-idled using exactly these 50% CPU.

It was in all Mandrake 2.4.+ kernels I remember; I still have
2.4.8-31.1mdk, I'll try it.
