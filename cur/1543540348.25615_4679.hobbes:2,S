Hi all
I have this p75 computer set up as a firewall for the 
internal network with linux-2.2 and ipchains, masquerading.
It looks like the CPU is too slow, as it drops packets 
(though it did help highering 
/proc/sys/net/core/netdev_max_backlog). At the same time, 
top and vmstat reports 95%+ idle time. Does anyone have any 
idea why? Is this type of kernel time measured somewhere 
else, or is the problem somewhere else? In my head?
Thanks in advance
Please cc: any answer to me, as I'm not on the list.
