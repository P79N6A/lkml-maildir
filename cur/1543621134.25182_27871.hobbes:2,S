    I'm a little confused about the status of the EEPro100 driver.
    The version in the current kernel has 2 version numbers, and 2
    dates:
    v1.09j-t 9/29/99 Donald Becker
    and
     $Revision: 1.36 $ 2000/11/17 Modified by Andrey V. Savochkin
     While the driver available at
     
http://www.scyld.com/network/eepro100.html
 has a version and date
     of v1.19 12/19/2001. 
     A couple questions:
     (1) Has this driver code "forked"?
     (2) Is there a technical reason that Mr. Beckers version is not
     being kept up to date? 
     (3) We are experiencing a slight problem with the current version
     ( eth1: card reports no resources.) that is supposedly fixed in
     v1.19. Are there plans to integrate the current v1.19 into the main
     line?
