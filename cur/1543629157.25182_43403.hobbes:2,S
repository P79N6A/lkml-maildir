Subject: 2.5.12(bk): IPv6 over IPv4 tunnel device initialization

Hello,
just came across a suspicious warning:
...
  CC net/ipv6/ip6_input.o
  CC net/ipv6/addrconf.o
  CC net/ipv6/sit.o
.../net/ipv6/sit.c:67: warning: initialization makes integer from pointer without a cast
...
It looks like the order of fields in net_device has changed,
as the net_device::init is not initialized now with
ipip6_fb_tunnel_init, but with a 0.
Using field labels in the initialization would be a good thing, imho.
