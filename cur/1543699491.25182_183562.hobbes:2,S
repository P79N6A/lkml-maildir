Hmm, weird.  I went to go look at the Shuttle motherboard maker's site - maybe so that I can bug them for a bios disconnect option - but I checked for a bios update first.  And sure enough like they read my mind, just posted online today, an update.  Here are the details of fixes:
" Checksum:   8B00H                         Date Code: 12/05/03
1.Support 0.18 micron AMD Duron (Palomino) CPU.
2.Add C1 disconnect item."
It's almost as they're reading this list.  This disconnect problem was discovered on the 5th (well the 5th in my timezone).  Perhaps they're aware of this issue...  I'm gonna talk to them.
