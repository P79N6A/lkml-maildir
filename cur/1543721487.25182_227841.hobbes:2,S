Please keep distinct "ship with" in the sense of /inside/ the
kernel and "ship with" in the sense of on the same distribution
media.  The GPL also has explicit wording for the latter
(you've already been quoted the words on the former):
"In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the 
Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program)
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other work under the scope of this License. "
I can't imagine anyone putting the Mozilla logo inside the
kernel, but if they do, as mentioned, that's a problem if
its license is not GPL.
