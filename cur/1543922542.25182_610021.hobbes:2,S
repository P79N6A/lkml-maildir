Subject: [PATCH 0/6] kill i386 and x86_64 directories
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This series kill the old i386 and x86_64 directories.
The relevant files are moved and adapted and
Kconfig.debug was consolidated (thanks to Randy).
I had to modify both the top-lvel Makefile and the kconfig
Makefile to accomplish this. It was done in such a way that
it is trivial for other archs to use the same mechanism
should they have the need.
To solve the defconfig issue (i386 and x86_64 cannot share one)
the arch/x86/configs/ directory were introduced. This has
been used by other archs for some time now but x86 had not had
the need until now.
The Kconfig files could be consolidated much more - I only
did the minimal changes to make it work in the new place.
