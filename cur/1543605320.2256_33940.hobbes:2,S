It actually doesn't need the promisc for most revisions of the card, but for
some it seems to be really needed.
The xircom_tulip_cb driver is more advanced, and probably works well for
your system. (It doesn't work for all cards, but I suspect that correlates
highly with the revision that needs the promisc)
