At least you should think twice before going above.  Even with wli's
stack reduction work applied, you still have close to 4k for kernel
stack.  But measuring the stack consumption of all the possible call
chains in the kernel is still a hard problem, so you will have a hard
time proving that any one bigger stack allocation is fine.
