That did the trick, thank you very much :) And I see ExplorerPS/2 works
like a charm with 2.4.x as well, so everything is just fine :) I guess
this actually was a stupid question, and I'm sorry.

I'm added #define ATKBD_DEBUG right below all the other define's in
atkbd.c, did a make clean; make dep; make bzImage and tried again. I
can't see any difference. It still just prints "input: AT Set 2 keyboard
on isa0060/serio0". I did, however, find out that if I press SHIFT+what
ever of the buttons arrows, insert, home, page up/down, delete and end,
I get just the same behaviour. It does not happen with CTRL or ALT.
Thank you very much.
