Subject: Calling userspace function from inside kernel (still) possible?

Hi all,
I am wondering whether it is possible to call a userspace routine from
within the kernel, say a module or something.
The Linux Kernel Hacker Guide states as one solution to call kerneld from
kernel mode and have it execute a seperate program.
Since kerneld had been replaced with kmod, and the kmod documentation
states it can only be used to load modules on demand this solution clearly
is not an option anymore.
Unfortunately this leaves my question unanswered, and that's why I am
turning to you, dear kernel list reader :). As I am not subscribed to the
list could anyone who is willing to answer please also CC his/her remarks to
my email address? I will of course also regularly check the mailinglist
archive.
( Little background info: I am thinking about an extension to the kernel via
a kernel module. Userspace processes can register themselves with that
module and be called whenever some condition in the kernel is met. When
someone has another idea about how to handle this situation I would
certainly like to hear it. )
Thanks in advance,
Arjan Opmeer
