Subject: Scheduled removal of SA_xxx interrupt flags

Hi Andrew,
   i've been going over the interrupt-handling code and noticed that the SA_xxx
   interrupt flags are scheduled for removal sometime in 9/2007 with a prior
   grace period of 6 months for people to fix external stuff. In order to do so,
   a __deprecated inline function wraps those flags.
   What puzzles me is that the __deprecated-patches are only in -mm and not in
   mainline. Is the -mm-testing audience wide enough to cause userspace to fix
   their apps prior to the SA_xxx removal or am I missing something? I.e,
   shouldn't tglx's patches hit mainline first?

Regards/Gruß,
    Boris.
