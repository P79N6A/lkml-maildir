Yours is a rather obscure grammatical question, especially concerning a
Changelog entry (which is not even as significant to developers as a
comment, IMO).  What difference in meaning do you imagine replacing
"This" with "That" would achieve?

What I meant (it probably wasn't very clear from the text) was that the
approach of leaving USB-PERSIST controlled by the power/persist
attribute and merely altering the attribute's default value is better
than having the kernel unilaterally and unconditionally turn
USB-PERSIST on for every device holding a mounted filesystem.  In other
words, the approach taken by the patch is better than the approach
suggested by Linus Torvalds.
