Yes, so it can be associated with the correct device.
No idea why it's affecting your serial console though - the autoconfig
should be transparent once it's completed.  Sure, if you enable
serial debugging (thereby making it produce output during the autoconfig)
it will mess it up, but that's the standard gun and foot scenario.
