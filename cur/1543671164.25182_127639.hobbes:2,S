Hi Andrew, list
I've been experiencing some odd behavior running 2.5.67-mm3 on my RH9 
based desktop.
It's probably an application bug, but something strange is happening 
anyway that doesn't happen in 'stable' kernels.
What happens is that gnome-terminal gets stuck in some sort of 'infinite 
loop' when a lot of output is going to the screen and also keypresses are 
going in (like paging through a large file - holding down pgup/pgdown).
Xterm doesn't seem to be affected.
If I kill off the shell running inside the terminal, it recovers (that is, 
when gnome-terminal is running as a 'factory' the window that is hung 
disappears but the process and all of the other windows are fine).
I captured some 'strace' of this while it was happening (sorry about the 
wrapping, the lines are quite long):
ioctl(3, FIONREAD, [0])                 = 0
poll([{fd=17, events=POLLIN}, {fd=3, events=POLLIN}, {fd=4, 
events=POLLIN}, {fd=8, events=POLLIN}, {fd=10, events=POLLIN|POLLPRI}, 
{fd=11, events=POLLIN|POLLPRI}, {fd=12, ev
ents=POLLIN|POLLPRI}, {fd=13, events=POLLIN|POLLPRI}, {fd=15, 
events=POLLIN|POLLPRI}, {fd=14, events=POLLIN|POLLPRI}], 10, 0) = 0
write(3, "+\20\1\0", 4)                 = 4
read(3, "\1\1-\205\0\0\0\0&\0\300\3\0\0\0\0\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\370"..., 32) = 
32
ioctl(3, FIONREAD, [0])                 = 0
write(3, "5\20\4\0.\356)\2q\266#\2\24\0\25\0007\0\5\0/\356)\2.\356"..., 
328) = 328
read(3, "\1\1A\205\0\0\0\0&\0\300\3\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\370"..., 32) = 
32
ioctl(3, FIONREAD, [0])                 = 0
poll([{fd=17, events=POLLIN}, {fd=3, events=POLLIN}, {fd=4, 
events=POLLIN}, {fd=8, events=POLLIN}, {fd=10, events=POLLIN|POLLPRI}, 
{fd=11, events=POLLIN|POLLPRI}, {fd=12, ev
ents=POLLIN|POLLPRI}, {fd=13, events=POLLIN|POLLPRI}, {fd=15, 
events=POLLIN|POLLPRI}, {fd=14, events=POLLIN|POLLPRI}, {fd=22, 
events=POLLIN}, {fd=23, events=POLLIN}, {fd=21,
 events=POLLIN, revents=POLLIN}, {fd=24, events=POLLIN}, {fd=16, 
events=POLLIN}, {fd=25, events=POLLIN}], 16, 0) = 1
read(21, 0xbfffe8f0, 4294965249)        = -1 EFAULT (Bad address)
getpid()                                = 31085
write(2, "\n** (gnome-terminal:31085): WARN"..., 79) = 79
This exact sequence repeats ad infinitum. 
The gnome-terminal is apparently doing an invalid read of -1 bytes after 
poll is saying there is data available.
I don't know what this could mean.
