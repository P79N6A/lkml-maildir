no the reason redhat uses it is to allow a generic kernel for everyone.
having *ALL* drivers in kernel would make it huge, and some drivers
conflict with each other (not many) so they couldn't all be in there.
If you have made a custom kernel (that is configured properly) you don't
need to bother.  The question is if you configured it properly :)
I would suggest taking a config from redhat (it puts them in
/usr/src/linux/configs)
and just tweaking that. (sorry if i already said that once)
other pitfalls include not having the right root= entry (or missing one) in
lilo.conf.
