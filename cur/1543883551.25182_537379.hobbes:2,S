Hi, 
The following result was the effect of "info threads"
command
Architecture: x86_64 , Linux kernel : 2.6.7 and 2.6.20
34 process 541  0xffffffffa017544e in ?? ()
  33 process 540  schedule_timeout
(timeout=1101144554856)
    at kernel/timer.c:1164
  32 process 493  md_thread (arg=0xffffffff8068c800)
at drivers/md/md.c:4526
  31 process 384  schedule_timeout
(timeout=9223372036854775807)
---Type <return> to continue, or q <return> to
quit---q
 at kernel/timerQuit
  30 process 383  schedule_timeout
(timeout=1100444515608)
    at kernel/timer.c:1164
  29 process 382  0xffffffff801656b7 in worker_thread
(__cwq=0x100fb134650)
    at include/linux/sched.h:1163
  28 process 381  0xffffffff801656b7 in worker_thread
(__cwq=0x100fb134190)
    at include/linux/sched.h:1163
It displays the --- continue Or quit --- 
I have entered the 'q' (want to stop scrolling).
But, it shows the "Quit" and continues to scroll down.
We can observe that - the last line (24th line) on
cosole has a wrapped text (ie "at kernel/").
Please update me with the change.
Thanks
RAM
