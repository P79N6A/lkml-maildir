Hi,
With 2.2.0pre1-4:
With make config set to PII processor, I tried using pgcc. All builds
okay, but Linux halts at boot whilst trying to decompress the kernel
with an Out of memory message.
I only tried pgcc because if I set make config to the PII processor, it
sets flags such as -mpentiumpro which gcc 2.7.2.3 doesn't begin to
understand. I thought this was the only compiler that a kernel was
guaranteed to build with? So I tried pgcc and got the above result.
What compiler and version should I be using if I set the processor to
PII in make config? pgcc? egcs? gcc of some newer version?
The whole thing builds and runs fine if I switch to Pentium/TSC. (just
-O2 optimisation)
gcc version pgcc-2.91.60 19981201 (egcs-1.1.1 release))
450MHz PII, 128MB RAM, EIDE UDMA.
Please CC me on any replies as I'm not subscribed to the list.
