Actually, it CAN happen.
While the compression algorithm is good, you CAN get cases where it cannot
compress a full page at all, and in fact it will add a few bytes of state
information to the compression. So at uncompression time you may actually
end up needing more than 4096 bytes.
It basically never happens with "normal" loads, but it does happen if
cramfs crams a already compressed file. Not something you normally want to
do, but if it is occasional it may make sense just to avoid special cases.

Right now, no. I'd like to change that, but I ended up releasing cramfs
early, just because (a) some of the LinuxCare people seemed interested and
(b) I'ma big believer in releasing early and getting comments from people.
Comments and patch very gratefully taken.

Sounds fine.. POSIX conformance wasn't really high on my list, simply
because I think cramfs is most useful for rescue disks and possibly
embedded devices, but you're obviously right.

The 64MB limit is originally just because my first version didn't do the
shift by two, and I added that later but didn't update mkcramfs. Thanks.
The patch looks good apart from the overzealous test for the length of the
required source stream, applied. And thanks,
