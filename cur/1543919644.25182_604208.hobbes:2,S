IMO we should try to logically separate the "search" and "push"
functionality (for instance, see my series).  The search is useful
outside the "push" operation for cases where we are waking a lower-task
that doesn't preempt on the current RQ.  In that case, we can try to
wake it directly on the optimal queue instead of waking locally and then
pushing away.

I agree, though I think we will achieve that once the final 3rd part of
the algorithm is implemented.  Stay tuned for an update in that area.
