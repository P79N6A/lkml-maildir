Alan,
I analyzed 2 latest patches from www.kernel.org:
patch-2.4.22-pre4 and patch-2.4.22-pre3-ac1.
-pre4 do not touch seq_file;
-pre3-ac1 corrects spelling and adds single_xxx functions. There is no 
conflict between this patch and my one. I verified, they do apply in any 
order (with some offset).
Vladimir.
