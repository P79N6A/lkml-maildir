Ahh, so many cats, and so few recipes here Ingo.  In this case cats=patches & 
recipes=time to test adequately.  I do have another box, but it would 
probably take a week & about a big buck to get that old rh7.3 brought up to 
date & suitable, and its only a 500MHZ K-III, which might make the diffs more 
obvious.  It would need a video card to replace its dinosaur Diamond and a 
fresh dvd drive.  And its motherboard has very buggy usb chips.  TYAN S-1590.  
Never could get anything bigger than a mouse packet through them.
