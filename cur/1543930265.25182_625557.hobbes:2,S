Mine is Debian Etch, normally with the latest released or -rcX kernel
from kernel.org.  Updates current as of about 18 hours ago.  Udev
package version is 0.105-4.  The RELEASE-NOTES file in /usr/share/doc/udev
says "udev 105".

Not in my case: everything I need at boot time is built-in.

I can answer the above later when I'm back in front of the machine, but
even in the "not good" case, I still see the following messages from
the /etc/rcS.d/S03udev file:
	Starting the hotplug events dispatcher udevd.
	Synthesizing the initial hotplug events.
This is where udevtrigger gets called, followed by the load_input_modules
and create_dev_makedev functions, then...
	Waiting for /dev to be fully populated.
which is where udevsettle gets called.
None of the above appear to be exiting abnormally for the bad case, but
I'll definitely take a closer look at what MAKEDEV (/dev/MAKEDEV -->
/sbin/MAKEDEV) is doing.  In particular, Debian MAKEDEV is looking at
/proc/devices to decide what to do, so maybe "cat /proc/devices" would
be useful to look at for the broken case.
