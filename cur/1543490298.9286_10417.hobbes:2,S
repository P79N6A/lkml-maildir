I take it that this is not true of buses that the CPU can't see, and that the
I2O controller looks after those.
Actually, I guess this is mostly irrelevent because the CPU won't share
IRQ/ioport/etc space with the I2O controller on these buses.
Wrt to my configuration manager's bus abstraction, a bus is dealt with by it's
bridge device.

I'm not sure, but I think you may have misunderstood what I meant... Can the
I2O controller configure and control ISA devices, such as a PnP SCSI card.
