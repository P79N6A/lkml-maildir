I think it should be possible to integrate reiserfs once the
new VM code is ready. The VM plans we have for 2.4 are all in
the "obviously right" category and will be more a code and
mechanism cleanup than new mechanisms, with the exception of
the page->mapping->flush(page) callback which is needed for
journaling filesystems.
