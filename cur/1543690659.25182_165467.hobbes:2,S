Would be nice if somebody with more knowledge about all the
benchmarks and a few non AMD processor machines could test
to see if its really that non critical (*hint* *hint*).  Yes,
I am not a kernel dev, but I do know that one or two slowdowns
in an already slow path is not that critical - problem now is
just that 5 or 6 might be an issue =)
