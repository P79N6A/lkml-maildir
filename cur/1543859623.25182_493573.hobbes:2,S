Iterrupt handlers are executend in the process context (on top of the
process that they interrupted).
So, if you have a proccess A that does:
	Usual Kernel Code		Interrupt Handler
	...
	spin_lock(my_lock);
	...
		-------interrupt----->	...
					spin_lock(my_lock); // deadlock!
					...
		<------ back --------- 
	----
	spin_unlock(my_lock);
See?
If the interrupt comes in when process A is running and holding the
lock PREEMPTION can't do anything.
