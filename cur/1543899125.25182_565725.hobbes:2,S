There was a discussion about this on 
http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2007-April/msg01079.html
Which concludes with what Alan Cox wrote.
"In DMA modes the 32bit I/O feature and multi-sector mode are not used. For
the moment libata also only supports 32bit PIO on some controllers and for 
those
it si handled automatically. Over time it may well gain 32bit support for 
more,
but again the goal is it will be entirely automatically done if so."
