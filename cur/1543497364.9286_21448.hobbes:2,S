Ext2 is maybe better for random acces on heavily fragmented files. But for
sequential access or when files are not very fragmented (most common case)
it is bad. We once go through HPFS-like tree, remember the current
fragment and on next bmap requests, we just return sector directly
_without_ any bread. However, on ext2, few breads are done on every bmap.
Binary search could be used - it is not so slow (well, my driver doesn't
do it because I'm too lazy :-)
As there are _much_ less sectors spent on allocation info in HPFS, it
saves disk accesses.
