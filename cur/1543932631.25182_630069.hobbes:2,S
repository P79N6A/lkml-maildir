I think we need more details on why this patch is needed. Also, we 
already have something like this in arch/x86/pci/mmconfig-shared.c, in 
the unreachable_devices function. This attempts to detect devices where 
MMCONFIG cannot access the configuration space (one of these would be at 
least one device in the AMD K8 built-in northbridge). If this is not 
sufficient, I would suggest expanding that mechanism instead of adding 
all this new code.
