I forgot that he mentioned that this was for ioctls. I then use
semaphores if I need to access userspace. But if it just needs to modify
data around areas that only the kernel uses, without access to
userspace, than I use spinlocks.
I admit you really need to know what you're doing to use this method. If
I believe that a kmalloc would be too expensive, then I use the locking
of static variables. But each situation is different and I try to use
the best method for the occasion.
