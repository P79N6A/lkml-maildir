I tried just ignoring more ACKs in i8042_interrupt() but that didn't do 
anything other than alternating between 2 and 1 i8042.c printks between 
atkbd.c printks when ignoring an even or oneven number, respectively. I 
guess it's atkbd.c which needs to ack something to keep it from just 
being delivered over and over again or something like it?
If I apply the following, things seem to be working for me; no "Spurious 
ACK" messages anymore (but a steady stream of fa's from i8042). Not a 
real fix, but I hope it's enough of a clue for someone who understands 
the infrastructure here. Vojtech added to CC as well.
I by the way also tried plugging in a PS/2 mouse (I normally use a USB 
mouse), adding atkbd_reset=1 to the kernel params and lifting the
        if (!flags && data == ATKBD_RET_ACK)
                 atkbd->resend = 0;
out of the ! __i386__ define. No help.
