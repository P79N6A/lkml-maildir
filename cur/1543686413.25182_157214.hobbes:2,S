Take a moment to think about this (as it is currently):
#define CB_ID(vend,dev,type)                            \
        {                                               \
                .vendor         = vend,                 \
                .device         = dev,                  \
                .subvendor      = PCI_ANY_ID,           \
                .subdevice      = PCI_ANY_ID,           \
                .class          = PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_CARDBUS << 8, \
                .class_mask     = ~0,                   \
                .driver_data    = CARDBUS_TYPE_##type,  \
        }
vs:
#define CB_ID(vend,dev,type)                            \
        {                                               \
                PCI_DEVICE(vend,dev),			\
                .class          = PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_CARDBUS << 8, \
                .class_mask     = ~0,                   \
                .driver_data    = CARDBUS_TYPE_##type,  \
        }
and realise that you can't do the second if you include {} into
PCI_DEVICE.
