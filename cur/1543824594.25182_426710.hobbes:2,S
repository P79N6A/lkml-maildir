I know fujitsu's engineers posted codes to add devices under container in past
and it knew dependency of memory -> cpu. It was rejected.
So, the current container driver just uses acpi_bus_add/start() to add/start all
devices under the container.

Currently, I think  creating new empty node (pgdat) at onlining can work.
by cpu hotplug notifier chain, dangling cpus will create new pgdat.
If people want to see node <-> cpu relationship before onlining cpu, I' ll have
to do complicated work.
I also expects we can migrate per-cpu in notifier chain if  VM-per_cpu is 
implemented.
