You're not understanding the model.  I understand your comment about
using 386 kernels for install kernels.  If Adrian's patch is done
right, _absolutely nothing should change_ in your described scenario.
Distros would continue doing what they've always done, and would
continue to get the behavior they have always gotten.
Unless you're a power user and select CONFIG_EMBEDDED, of course.
Then behavior changes.
