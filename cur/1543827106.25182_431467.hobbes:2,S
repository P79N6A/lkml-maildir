Users are also forced to remember that, if they use certain new
distros or programs, they are locked out of using older kernels.  They
are forced to remember that if they have certain newer hardware, they
are locked out of using older kernels.  They are forced to remember
that if they use ext3 (or XFS or JFS) _at all_ they are locked out of
using older kernels.  Why single out this particular aspect of limited
forward compatibility to harp on so much?
