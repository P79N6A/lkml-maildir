I'll look over this shortly.  I posted an io_remap_pfn_range() patch
to the linux-mm mailing list last week:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-ultrasparc&m=111049550001120&w=2
One of the things that it needs to take into account is that
io_remap_page_range() on sparc/sparc64 has 6 parameters instead of 5.
My patch tries to remedy that...
