+	bool "Enable resource accounting/control"
+	default n
+	help
+	  When Y this option provides accounting and allows configuring
+	  limits for user's consumption of exhaustible system resources.
+	  The most important resource controlled by this patch is unswappable
+	  memory (either mlock'ed or used by internal kernel structures and
+	  buffers). The main goal of this patch is to protect processes
+	  from running short of important resources because of accidental
+	  misbehavior of processes or malicious activity aiming to ``kill''
+	  the system. It's worth mentioning that resource limits configured
+	  by setrlimit(2) do not give an acceptable level of protection
+	  because they cover only a small fraction of resources and work on a
+	  per-process basis.  Per-process accounting doesn't prevent malicious
+	  users from spawning a lot of resource-consuming processes.
