For HPC, maybe. For a fileserver, it might be far too little. That's the
trouble ... it's all dependant on the workload. Personally, I'd prefer
to get rid of manual tweakables (which are a pain in the ass in the field
anyway), and try to have the kernel react to what the customer is doing.
I guess we can leave them there for overrides, but a self-tunable default
would be most desirable.
For instance, would be nice if we started doing writeback to the spindles
that weren't busy much earlier than if the disks were thrashing.
