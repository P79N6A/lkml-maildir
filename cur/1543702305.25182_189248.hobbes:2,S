Exactly. It works today, because:
 - the device nodes are there.
   Ergo: udev should create the device nodes
 - the kernel autopartitions the device on any open (both main device and 
   the subpartitions) when it notices a changed media. No polling 
   required.
   Ergo: the kernel should continue to do this.
We should _not_ be in the situation where either of these things aren't 
true.
