Is there some generic in-kernel support for mixing? I couldn't make
any of the userspace programs work.
I tried esd and it does the same as without esd - only one app gets to
the sound and the other waits.  The only difference was only (horrible)
increase in sound latency.
Installed esd in gentoo by emerge, then added into the startiup scripts,
/etc/init.d/esd start, switched xmms over to esd and skype on start said
"using esd". 
I would like to just run two sound programs concurrently. (Linux is a
time-sharing operating system, right?) I am not interested in a delay
line sound effect.
I also tried artsd and jack, but didn't succeed too.
