Yes, I do.  FA_FL_DEL_DATA is plain stupid, a preallocation call should
never delete data.  FA_FL_DEALLOC should probably be a separate syscall
because it's very different functionality.
While we're at it I also dislike the FA_ prefix becuase it doesn't say
anything and is far too generic.  FALLOC_ is much better.

NACK on this one.  We should have just one behaviour, and from the thread
that not freeing the allocation on error.

NACK to these aswell.  If i_size changes c/mtime need updates, if the size
doesn't chamge they don't.  No need to add more flags for this.
