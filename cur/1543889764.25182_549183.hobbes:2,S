Right, those are two different things. But paranoia aside, will this
ever be a real life problem? I've always been of the opinion to just
nicely ignore them. We can't easily detect it and tell the user his hw
is crap.

The problem with Neils reasoning there is that blkdev_issue_flush() may
use the same method as the barrier to ensure data is on platter.
A barrier write will include a flush, but it may also use the FUA bit to
ensure data is on platter. So the only situation where a fallback from a
barrier to flush would be valid, is if the device lied and told you it
could do FUA but it could not and that is the reason why the barrier
write failed. If that is the case, the block layer should stop using FUA
and fallback to flush-write-flush. And if it does that, then there's
never a valid reason to switch from using barrier writes to
blkdev_issue_flush() since both methods would either both work or both
fail.

It's not block layer breakage, it's a device issue.

That's unfortunately very true. It's an artifact of the sometimes
problematic device capability discovery.

Because if it doesn't support barriers, blkdev_issue_flush() wouldn't
work either. At least that is the case for SATA/IDE, SCSI is somewhat
different (and has somewhat other issues).

blkdev_issue_flush() isn't part of the barrier API, and using it as a
work-around for a device that has barrier "issues" is wrong for the
reasons listed above.
The DRAIN_FUA -> DRAIN_FLUSH automatic downgrade I mentioned above
should be added, in which case blkdev_issue_flush() would never be
needed (unless you want to do a data-less barrier, and we should
probably add that specific functionality with an empty bio instead of
providing an alternate way of doing that).
