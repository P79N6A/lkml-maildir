In case someone likes to do job, GCC usually ought to do, i would
suggest something like this instead:
       if (expanded && test_bit(STRIPE_EXPANDING, &sh->state)) {
               /* Need to write out all blocks after computing P&Q */
-               sh->disks = conf->raid_disks;
+	       	i = conf->raid_disks;
+		sh->disks = i;
-               sh->pd_idx = stripe_to_pdidx(sh->sector, conf,
-                                            conf->raid_disks);
+               sh->pd_idx = stripe_to_pdidx(sh->sector, conf, i);
               compute_parity6(sh, RECONSTRUCT_WRITE);
-               for (i = conf->raid_disks ; i-- ;  ) {
+		do {
                       set_bit(R5_LOCKED, &sh->dev[i].flags);
                       locked++;
                       set_bit(R5_Wantwrite, &sh->dev[i].flags);
-               }
+		} while (--i);
               clear_bit(STRIPE_EXPANDING, &sh->state);
       } else if (expanded) {
In any case this is subject of scripts/bloat-o-meter.
