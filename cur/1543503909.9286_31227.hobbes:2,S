I have no idea. 
I do know, however, that that Contaq chip (combination PCI->ISA bridge +
IDE + other standard pc hardware) is one we consider special and don't
initialize, but leave to the previous console code.  SRM in this case.
And that chip _does_ decode at least 17 bits, but probably all of them.

PS: Don't ask me why it's special.  Jay wrote that, and I presume for
a reason.  Only recently do I have a machine that contains one.  Perhaps
it's irrelevant now that we have a real IDE driver for it.
