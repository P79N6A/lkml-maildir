G'd day,
Looks like that given async NFS mount Linux NFS client can reorder
RENAMEs as well. For me this caused several eaten files :/. Didn't
really expect RENAME to be reordered as mv is generally considered
atomic. That, and RFC 1813 mandates RENAME to be atomic. Is this a
known thing and do you guys consider this feature or a bug?
