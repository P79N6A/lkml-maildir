The same thing happens on Altix machines, our xio<->pci bridges don't show up.

It's been awhile since I looked at this API, but this would allow userland to 
map legacy I/O or mem space for a given device using the above commands?

This would also work, but then on some platforms (like ia64) legacy space 
requires special treatment since target aborts can cause hard fails, so I'd 
prefer the previous approach since it would make setup for dealing with such 
platforms a bit more explicit.
Thanks,
