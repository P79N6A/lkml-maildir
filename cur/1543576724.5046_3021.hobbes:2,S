I missed your earlier mails, could you resend the details? 
I'm interested in the output from
	tulip-diag -m -a -f
before and after a link failure.
I'm aware that the tulip drivers doesn't handle cable disconnects and
reconnects with MII pnic cards. I have a patch for that problem, but it
affects _all_ MII tulip cards, and thus it won't be included soon. If
tulip-diag says "10mbps-serial", then you have run into that bug.
