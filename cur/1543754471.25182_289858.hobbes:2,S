Hi Andrea,
Your OOM Killer patch was tested and a strange behaviour was found.
Basically as normal user we started some applications as openoffice,
mozilla and emacs.
And as a root (in another tty) we started a simple program that uses
malloc in a forever loop as below:
int main (void)
{
  int * mem;
  for (;;)
        mem = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));
  return 0;
}
Using the original OOM Killer, malloc is the first killed application
and the sytem is restored in a useful state. After applying your patch
and accomplish the same experiment, the OOM Killer it does not kill
malloc program and it enters in a kind of forever loop as below:
1) out_of_memory is invoked;
2) select_bad_process is invoked;
3) the following condition is fullfied;
if ((unlikely(test_tsk_thread_flag(p, TIF_MEMDIE)) || (p->flags &
PF_EXITING)) &&
			    !(p->flags & PF_DEAD))
				return ERR_PTR(-1UL);
4) step 1, 2 ,3 above is executed again;
This loop (step 1 until step 4) lasts during a long time (and nothing
is killed) until I give up and reboot the system after waiting for
some minutes.
Any comments? What do you think about our test case? Could you
accomplish the same test case using malloc program as root and other
graphical applications as normal user?
Let me know about your ideas.
BR,
Mauricio Lin.
