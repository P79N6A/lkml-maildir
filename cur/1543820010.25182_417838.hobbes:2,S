IIUC, AppArmor does impose such constraints, but only from the
perspective of an individual program's profile.  Upon link(2), they
check that the program had link permission to the old link name and that
both the old link name and new link name have consistent permissions in
the profile, and they prohibit or limit by capability the ability to
manipulate the namespace by confined programs.  But this doesn't mean
that another program running under a different profile can't create such
a link (if allowed to do so by its profile, of course), or that an
unconfined process cannot do so.  There is no real "system policy" or
system-wide security properties with AppArmor; you can only look at it
in terms of individual programs (which themselves are identified by path
too).

Indeed.  I think Thomas Bleher made a good assessment of it in:
