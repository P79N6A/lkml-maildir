Yes, I added that piece after the x86_64 problem.  The original x86_64
bug was that you couldn't do dma_map_sg() then dma_unmap_sg() then
dma_map_sg() on the same scatterlist (the map was destroying information
which wasn't restored on the unmap, so the second map produced an
incorrect scatterlist), which was causing a bug in all SCSI drivers
(because that's the way SCSI requeueing works).
