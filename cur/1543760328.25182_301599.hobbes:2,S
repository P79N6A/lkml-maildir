One rule that I thought would make sense, but that I don't see listed
is:
 - must fix a regression
If some problem was in 2.6.X and is still there in 2.6.X+1, then there
is no great rush to fix it for 2.6.(X+1).1, it can wait for 2.6.(X+2).
Security issues could be an exception to this, or it could be seen
that the publication of a security vulnerability causes a regression
which needs to be fixed...
