compile, boot, play.
all good so far, after a few config niggles.
wireless LAN working, USB mouse, acpi etc all seem fine.
i hadn't tried any of the .5 series mainly through lack of time, so i
was a little worried that something would go boom - a happy
misconception.
thanks `grep N: /usr/local/src/linux-2.6.0-test1/CREDITS`,
