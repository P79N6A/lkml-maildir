A lot of buggy code consists of perfectly valid C99. :)

There is a deeper problem to this.  At the moment, there is no way to
prove that the kernel doesn't contain a stack overflow somewhere.  In
order to do this, we can make some assumptions and do a formal proof
*as long as the assumptions are valid*.
This perfectly valid C99 code means either that we need very
complicated checker software - a problem in itself - or that the
assumptions are wrong and we are none the wiser.
And even if you ignore this pet project of mine, do you know of a sane
way to have an upper bound for a VLA?  And if there is, why not use a
static array with the upper bound as size in the first place?
Explicit is always simpler than implicit and simpler code has less
bugs. :)
