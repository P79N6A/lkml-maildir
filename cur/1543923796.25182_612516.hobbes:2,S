This is useful.
Even more useful would be a show_regs() on the cpu where running tasks
are running.  If not a full show_regs() at least a program counter.
That's usually what you're trying to debug and we provide nearly no
way to handle: some task is stuck in a loop in kernel mode and you
need to know exactly where that is.
This is pretty easy to do on sparc64.  In fact I can capture remote
cpu registers even when that CPU's interrupts are disabled.  I suppose
other arches could do a NMI'ish register capture like this as well.
I have a few bug reports that I can't make more progress on because I
currently can't ask users to do something to fetch the registers on
the seemingly hung processor.  This is why I'm harping on this so
much :-)
Anyways, my core suggestion is to add a hook here so platforms can
do the remote register fetch if they want.
