Would memory fragmentation have any appreciable impact on L2 cache line 
collisions?
Would defragmenting it help?
In the case of the Opteron, there is a 1M cache that is (I forget) N-way 
set associative, and it's physically indexed.  If a bunch of pages were 
located such that there were a disproportionately large number of lines 
which hit the same tag, you could be thrashing the cache.
There are two ways to deal with this:  (1) intelligently locates pages 
in physical memory; (2) hope that natural entropy keeps things random 
enough that it doesn't matter.
