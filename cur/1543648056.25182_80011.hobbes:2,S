Suits me 8-)
Though a drivers/bus/ would make sense too for things like pci, sbus, 
and friends, but that kind of thing can wait until 2.7 I think 8-)
To get back to the point, drivers/ seems cluttered, and as the
objective is decluttering drivers/char/ removing a dozen files, and
replacing them with a single directory in that dir just seems better
than adding an extra dir in drivers/ to me, but then again, I could
be out of my tiny little mind.
