One more thing:
http://prisguide.hardware.no/product.php?product_id=39908&view=productinfo
It turns out the socket is "Socket 479M" ... thats pentium-m isn't it?
This also seems to agree its pentium-m:

By the way, these results came from a google of "L2400 prescott", so its

Therefore, i'm going with pentium-m!
Thanks for the help guys,
George
