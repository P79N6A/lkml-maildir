So it would be useful to have
clear_page 	-> Temporal. Only zaps one page
	and
clear_pages	-> Zaps arbitrary order of page non-temporal
Rework the clear_pages patch to do just that? Maybe rename clear_pages
clear_pages_nt?
prep_zero_page would use a temporal clear for an order 0 page but a
nontemporal clear for higher order pages.
