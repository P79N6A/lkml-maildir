No, neither device needs atomic allocations, I just said that device
mapper is too expensive, since it performs alot of additional
allocations in the fast path and is not designed to cases when
allocation fails, since there is no recovery path and (maybe because of
this) mempool allocation waits forever until there is free memory
and can not fail.
