When compiling the kernel with the latest HEAD branch from egcs CVS, the
kernel locks up at the "Calibrating delay loop..." step.
Both kernels 2.2.14 pre4 and 2.3.27 pre6 are affected
Backing down to gcc 2.95.2 cures the problem for both kernels.
egcs target:  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/egcs --enable-languages=c
make bootstrap succeeds.
hardware:  Dual P-II, ASUS P2B motherboard
kernel target:  SMP, pentium pro (m686), default kernel CFLAGS for that
target.  I did not try uniprocessor to see if it would work.
