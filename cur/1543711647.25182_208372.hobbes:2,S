In the case of a trylock failure, it should probably return a
random value.  For heavily page faulting multithreaded apps,
that would mean we'd tend towards random replacement, instead
of FIFO.
Then again, the locking problems shouldn't be too bad in most
cases.  If you're swapping the program will be waiting on IO
and if it's not waiting on IO there's no problem.
