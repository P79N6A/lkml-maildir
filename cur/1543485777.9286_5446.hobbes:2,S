You are right, if you use lofs directly e.g.:
mount -F lofs /local /mnt
But that's like a symbolic link. That means you can't determine the cwd
correctly (If you do a cd .. at /mnt/x you are in /local). But
nevertheless was lofs designed to be mounted like
mount godzilla:/local /mnt
if your machine names godzilla. And in this way the rmdir works as
expected. So I think the above error is a bug in lofs.

Well I think so: Imagine the current process deletes its
working-directory. Then it tries to access a file e.g. ../cfg/test. This
results in an error, because the process can't determine its current
working directory, so the relative path fails and the process dies
probably.
In my eyes this is the cause for not allowing the cwd be removed by the
running process. (Of curse, if another process deletes the directory the
process will die nevertheless).
