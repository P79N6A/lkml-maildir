Yay! That's much less dependent on the exact nature of whatever the
underlying bug is :) a random 9/10, well, it just makes my skin itch
even if it does work (unless there turned out to be a fundamental reason
why 9/10 was the right value, that is).

I think we can live with that. Expecting perfect accuracy, even in a
sleep, is hopeless unless we're niced to realtime priority in any case,
and this looks like it should automatically adapt to varying load on
the host as well, which is really quite neat.
I'll give it an acid test (does ISC dhclient work now?) in a few hours,
when I can afford to drop offline.
