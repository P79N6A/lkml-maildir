Hmmm... Could it be that we are just playing too much with spinlocks. ;)
Even if the simple 'mov' may ensure other processors to have a consistent
view of the spinlock, it does not prevent the CPU that unlocks from
playing with speculative execution around the 'unlock' and perform
speculative reads for example. Without a minimal serialization this stuff
does not seem safe to me, or at least not for ever.
