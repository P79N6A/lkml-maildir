Not necessarily. I said that "READA/WRITEA" are only worth exporting
inside the kernel - because the latencies and complexities are low-level
enough that it should not be exported to user space as such.
But I could imagine a kernel aio package that does the equivalent of
	bh->b_end_io = completion_handler;
	generic_make_request(WRITE, bh);	/* this may block */
	bh= bh->b_next;
	/* Now, fill it up as much as we can.. */
	current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
	while (more data to be written) {
		if (generic_make_request(WRITEA, bh) < 0)
			break;
		bh = bh->b_next;
	}
	return;
and then you make the _completion handler_ thing continue to feed more
requests. Yes, you may block at some points (because you need to always
have at least _one_ request in-flight in order to have the state machine
active, but you can basically try to avoid blocking more than necessary.
But do you see why the above can't be done from user space? It requires
that the completion handler (which runs in an interrupt context) be able
to continue to feed requests and keep the queue filled. If you don't do
that, you'll never have good throughput, because it takes too long to send
signals, re-schedule or whatever to user mode.
And do you see how it has to block _sometimes_? If people do hundreds of
AIO requests, we can't let memory just fill up with pending writes..
