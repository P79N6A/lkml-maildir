I don't really see the similarity between the MTD subsystem and dividing 
vram up by files. Video cards don't have "erase blocks". And MTD is not 
a filesystem. And the onboard memory mtd driver (map system RAM) only 
handles one fixed region determined at load time.
Vramfs on the other hand determines what resources to use at mount time. 
It supports multiple mounts, one per PCI device, if you want the 
combined VRAM of two VGA cards in your system.
I don't think vramfs would fit well into the MTD subsystem.
