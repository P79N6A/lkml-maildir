I did not mean I have a problem with that.  Say you take svgalib, and
you want the build system to automatically compile the kernel module,
you might do something like:
---
build_2_6_module:
	@make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build M=`PWD`
---
will break with proposed patch ...
And the point I wanted to make was that AFIAK
'/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build' is an interface to figure
out where the _sources_ for the current running kernel are
located.  And apparently I am not the only one, as most if
not all external projects use this as the way (or one of
them at least) to determine this ... 
Thanks,
