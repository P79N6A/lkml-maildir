??? what line am I crossing? Or do you mean that I would be if I were
to do something, and if so, what is that something? I informed you the
day that  decided I was interested in exploring the internals of other
SCM products, and deleted the bk binaries from my machine at the same
time.

That's nonsense. There are plenty of bk changesets that I could
download from numerous public sources. They would provide just as much
information about bk internals as any other bk changesets. There are
complete (non-Linus) linux trees available in changeset form. If
reverse engineering were my goal, then those would be sufficient. The
question is one of ownership. Does bitmover own the changeset or does
the developer own the changeset?

You specifically asked if it would address people's issues. I could
only speak for myself...and I did.
