   <sigh>  There is nothing in the SMTP RFCs that require any to be able to
   accept all email at all times.
The lack of the systems ability to handle the email at this moment is
not what Matti is complaining about.
You will find in RFC0821, section 4.2.1, what return code "500" is
designated to mean.
