Plus, I'd guess, the old rtc driver statically linked.
What I see is a should-not-happen fault of some kind in a cleanup
path that's been tested with non-PNP rtc drivers.  A quick glance
at the code left me puzzled.  Would sleeping a second or two before
calling rtc_device_unregister() change that behavior?
