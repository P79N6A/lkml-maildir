I was thinking of queueing the writes to the metadata, and then queue
the writes of the data marked with bio_barrier(); when the data write
completes I end the original bio.
Although if they metadata is on a different device, I do have to wait
for the metadata to be written because the barrier is useless; but OTOH
if I use a journal I can't split my data and metadata in two different
devices, can I? (without using two journals or doing more complex
stuff).

I think I can't do this at the device-mapper layer. There's a .flush
function pointer, but I think it's suspend-related; and in any case I
gave it a try and it's never called during normal operation.

Thanks a lot for the suggestions!
As I said in the other email, I'll give the writes a try and see how it
goes. If their performance suck (what, from what you tell me, it's
likely) at least I'll have something that works.
Thanks a lot,
