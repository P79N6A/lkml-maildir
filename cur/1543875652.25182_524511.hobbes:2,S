In this whole message I can only help on this point.  Switching to ext2 
will not help.  You've got *something* wrong with YOUR setup.  I have 
used the kernels you mention in VERY large environments with excellent 
and stable results.
You need to find out what's up with the sata-bus-reset problem.  It 
won't do *me* any good but people who can fix your problem will want the 
entire .config and dmesg to even guess about what is going on with 
*your* situation.
For more info on XFS.  This is a pretty nice FAQ:
