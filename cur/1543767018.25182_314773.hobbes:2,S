Since a DLM is a distributed lock manager, its usage is entirely for
locking some shared resource (might not be storage, might be shared
state, shared data, etc).   If the DLM can grant a lock, but not
guarantee that other nodes (including the ones that have been kicked
out of the cluster membership) do not have a conflicting DLM lock, then
any applications that depend on the DLM for protection/coordination
be in trouble.  Doesn't the GFS code depend on the DLM not being
recovered until after fencing of dead nodes?
Is there a existing DLM that does not depend on fencing? (you said
yours was modeled after the VMS DLM, didn't they depend on fencing?)
How would an application use a DLM that does not depend on fencing?
Thanks,
Daniel
