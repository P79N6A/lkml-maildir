OK, right ... could we please get a sense of decorum back on this list.
Rob, if you didn't ask your alleged questions in such a pejorative
manner, we'd get a lot further; and Matthew, if you didn't rise to the

mediate behaviours that should have been educated out of you in the
kindergarten sand pit.
