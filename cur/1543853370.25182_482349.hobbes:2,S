Great, thanks.
I have that fix in rc5-mm2, as
pci-quirks-fix-the-festering-mess-that-claims-to-handle-ide-quirks-ide-fix.patch
- a fix against Greg's
gregkh-pci-pci-quirks-fix-the-festering-mess-that-claims-to-handle-ide-quirks.patch
There is no problem which cannot be solved with a sufficiently long filename.
