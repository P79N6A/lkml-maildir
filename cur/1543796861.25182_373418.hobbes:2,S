Hi,
Daily snapshots of the BCM43xx driver are
now available at
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/bcm43xx/snapshots/
The snapshots are generated at UTC 5:00am
(or should be, at least. :) Let's wait until tomorrow,
if I got the crontab correct.)
Have Fun.
PS: It seems like Distributions begin to ship the driver.
    Please do yourself a favour and don't do this, yet.
    The code is full of bugs and incomplete stuff and is
    changing very fast.
