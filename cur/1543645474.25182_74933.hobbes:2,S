I've tried it and w/o success so hd is still sleeping after resume. So
maybe the problem is somewhere else. Do you have any advice what should I
try now? 2.4.20-pre<latest>? Or some other files from 2.4.18?
BTW: I'm always waiting at most 5 minutes for hd wakeup, is that enough? I
hope so, since it's enough on 2.4.18...
<after some time looking into syslog>
Maybe you'll find usefull that I have these messages after resume in
syslog:
Sep 28 22:07:39 thinkpad apmd[211]: System Suspend

Sep 29 19:31:48 thinkpad apmd[211]: Normal Resume
But I don't know if they appear after every resume on working 2.4.18. I'd
have to check it.
Thanks a lot,
Karel
