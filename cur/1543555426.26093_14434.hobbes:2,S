Hi, I installed 2.4.0-test11 on a Dual P3-550 [Tyan Tiger 133 with
S1834 BIOS]. I updated the mobo with the latest bios found on Tyan's
website
http://www.tyan.com/support/html/b_tg_133.html
Reading dmesg, I found the following
mtrr: your CPUs had inconsistent variable MTRR settings
mtrr: probably your BIOS does not setup all CPUs
Am not sure if this is going to lead to bad juju. Anybody else seeing
this on a similar mobo
Regards, Yusuf
