It's fine to criticise sched_yield().  I agree that new apps should 
generally be written to use proper completion mechanisms or to wait for 
specific events.
However, there are closed-source and/or frozen-source apps where it's 
not practical to rewrite or rebuild the app.  Does it make sense to 
break the behaviour of all of these?
