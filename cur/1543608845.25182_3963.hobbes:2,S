Sorry, no doughnut for you.  drivers/block/genhd.c:
    #ifdef CONFIG_PROC_FS
    int get_partition_list(char *page, char **start, off_t offset, int count)
    {
	...
	char buf[64];
	...
	len += snprintf(page + len, 63, "%4d  %4d %10d %s\n", gp->major, n, 
		gp->sizes[n], disk_name(gp, n, buf));
so each /proc/partitions line maxes out at 63 bytes.  So not only
is there no overflow, I am providing 16 extra bytes of padding.
