As I understood the code, if you don't have platform_data set, it will
abort in the probe function so it depends what you mean by register. An
OHCI controller never gets created without platform_data.
You're right that the PXA platform device is always registered. FWIW,
there is no platform in mainline that doesn't have OHCI present so this
isn't a major problem at the moment.
The easiest solution might be to move the ohci device registration into
pxa_set_ohci_info (in pxa27x.c). I gave in and appended a patch (compile
tested only so far).
Cheers,
Richard
Only register the PXA OHCI platform device on platforms which provide
the platform data.
