You seem to run very interesting distribution; when reporting
*kernel* bugs (things), try to follow REPORTING-BUGS (in top dir. of kernel
sources): version (ver_linux), adding to CC list memory management
list from MAINTAINERS file.
As for me, kernel in oom condition is very bad thing. I don't think
"oom killer" idea is working in general (while it helps to link
allyesconfig kernel on 1G without swap ;).
Thus, i suggest you to play with stuff, described in
"Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting".
