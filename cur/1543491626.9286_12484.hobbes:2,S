Hi all,
	Got two things to say.
	I actually pulled the HD and managed to get RH to install by using another
'box'.  The first thing I checked when I got it back into the Omnibook was
the fstab file.  It confirms my thoughts.  Linux can mount any /{path} to
any partition. Thinking about it, it didn't make sense for Linux to be any
other way {I mean it's not a Micro$oft product}.
	Secondly, one of you politely pointed out that this may have not _quite_
been the most appropiate list.  That's the biggest problem I face with the
mailing lists, knowing which is the _most_ appropiate list to post to.
When I subscribed I tried to figure out 'which list for which' but the
subscription confirmation (and my searches for more information) were
unhelpfull.
	So appoligies for the spam and THANKS.
