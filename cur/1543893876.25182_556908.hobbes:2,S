I actually don't have anything remotely like ES7000 iether.  I just
found the problem while tracking down another randconfig failure.

Seems it would be cleaner to figure out some way to build es7000.c for
if CONFIG_X86_ES7000 is set?  Or just move them here all the time?

It seems that this #ifndef is not needed -- even if there is another
declaration of these functions that is visible, the signatures should
match so it should be OK.
