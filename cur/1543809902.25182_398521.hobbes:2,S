I don't speak for IBM or the authors, but there are perfectly
reasonable reasons to ask someone else to post a patch on your behalf
- including but not limited to to only being able to use Lotus Notes
with one's IBM email. I'm sure you've all seen the travesties that
Notes inflicts on inline patches.
