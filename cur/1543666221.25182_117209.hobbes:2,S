How we should do such global small cleanups?
Maybe grep the source and bring the list of affected files
to maintainers' attention, letting the to gradually push

will be a trickier part ;)

"if(p) free(p)" => "free(p)" is mostly ok, less code.
But free is called now unconditionally. Make an exception
for performance-critical places where p is almost always 0.
