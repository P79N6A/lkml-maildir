man, the Magic SysReq key didn't work ( at all ):
it were DEAD
The drive-light stayed on for 10+ hours, nothing happening ( that I could 
figure out ) the whole time.  It /stayed/ dead.
/dev/hde is part of a RAID-5 in my system ( because I no longer trust 
anything else ), and this only happens on drives connected onto the 
Promise controller.
Oh, yeah, I forgot to include this:
trying to touch/activate/read the S.M.A.R.T. in any drive on the Promise 
kills it, too.  Can't activate the reliability-system without killing 
the kernel? /that's/ ironic, eh?
As for having another terminal connected to my home machine...
1. if the kernel's dead, then how's that gonna work, and
2. why have 2 terminals on one machine when I'm a hermit?
I /do/ thank you for the interface-reset tip, though, I hope I never need 
that info  : )
