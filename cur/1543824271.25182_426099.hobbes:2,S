It's not a new policy, dammit.
Guys, a kernel developer who cannot understand that user space is 
important should just drop their pretentions of being a kernel developer, 
and go play with some toy system like Hurd instead. There you can say 
"user space doesn't matter".
The kernel has _one_ mission in life, and one mission only. Guess what 
that is? It's to be the buffer between user space and shared resources. 
That's it. NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.
If the kernel breaks user space, the kernel is broken. End of story. 
Yes, there are reasons we must occasionally allow for it anyway, but they 
should all be some pretty damn major ones. Like "we simply _had_ to, there 
was no choice, because the alternatives broke user space more".
Which isn't even _remotely_ the case here.
The whole point of a kernel is that it doesn't do anything for itself. 
It's there to serve user space.
