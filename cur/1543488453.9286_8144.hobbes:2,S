  I've been looking into VFS and ext2 code and it seems that there
is really nothing which prevents you from getting deleted inode
and because it has nlink=0 VFS tries to delete it once again when
you iput it. The conclusion is: don't get deleted inodes ;-).
But there could be some test in VFS or filesystem code whether
the nlink != 0 when reading inode...
