Why not leverage devicemapper, and implement muliple hierarchical
copy-on-write snapshots at the block device level?  It would be much
easier....

Why not use a DB?  Because most databases's are big and bloated and
not something you want to have in the kernel (not even Hans Reiser was
crazy enough to propose stuffing an SQL interpreter into the kernel :-)
--- and if you put the generic database (complete with SQL interpreter
and all the rest) in userspace, doing upcalls into userspace, and then
having to have the database interpret the SQL query, etc., takes time.
If you don't care about performance, by all means, try using FUSE and
implementing a user-space filesystem.  It will be slow as all get-out,
but maybe it won't matter for your application.

That won't be just open(), but stat(), readdir(), unlink(), rename(),
etc.  It's all going to depend on your workload and how much
filesystem access it requires.  It certainly won't be a general
purpose solution, and for some workloads it will be disaterously slow.
But hey, if you don't believe me, go ahead try implementing it.....
