Catastrophic failure of the IDE cable???.
What are you doing to the poor thing, jumping on it?
Anyway, with a UPS, the issue of IDE device write caching is fairly moot.
As long as power is applied, any write issued to the drive will be
completed regardless of whether write caching is on or off. I am fairly
certain the write caching is pretty conservative, which is write as soon
as possible after elavating with other write requests and giving read
requests priority.
I can imagine how it improves sequenial write performace too. With the
write cache off, the computer cannot send another write request to the IDE
device until the last one had finished. By the time the computer is told
the request was finished and it has sent a new request to the drive, the
disk would have spun out of the place it was supposed to be placed. The
drive will then have to wait for the disk to spin around fully again
before doing the write. With the write cache enabled, several requests can
be placed into the drive buffer and written in the single revolution of
the drive.
