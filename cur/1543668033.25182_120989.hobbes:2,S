Yeah, and I apologize. File deletion has been causing some problems 
lately due to some bad assumptions of the dentry layer. This patch reverts 
a small bit of the patch that went in a couple of weeks ago, and should 
hopefully fix everything up. 
This should also take care of the problem that some have been seeing of 
symlinks not going away on device/module removal (though I've been unable 
to reproduce those). 
Greg/Mike, could you give this patch a shot and let me know if helps?
Thanks,
