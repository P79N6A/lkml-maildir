Not all BIOS firmware can cope when we switch to UP-APIC. Some laptops 
really don't like it one bit.

Depends on the laptop. Speedstop is not documented by intel so either it
works because the APM bios did the right thing, or it doesn't work because
it didn't. The only kernel issue is delay loops. We calibrate them at boot
and assume the base clock is constant. In practice this isnt showing up as
a real problem, although we do need to switch to the ACPI timers on later
laptops
