Thanks for your answer (sorry, I didn't know your email had changed)
well, this will take some time since I don't work every day & it's
turned off most of the time, hope that is OK
before I proceed with that data-collection:
do you think it is possible that it might be related to "Fair group
CPU scheduler" being selected ?
I think that one and another additional option (don't know right now
its name, but will look for it later) was the only difference on the
.config-file between 2.6.23-rc8 & 2.6.23-rc8-git3 (+ sched-devel)
