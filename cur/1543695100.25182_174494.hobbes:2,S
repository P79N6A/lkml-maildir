Hi!
I'm using the kernel 2.6test8 from kernel.org with apm on my Laptop.
If I have X started I can't resume when suspend is finished. It's working 
without X. 
Is there any problem with the kernel, apm and X? 
Here some informations about my system:
Hardware:
Gericom Webgine XL Force
P4@2,4GHz
512 MB of RAM
nVidia GeForce 4 Go (32 MB memory)
BIOS supports APM and ACPI
Software:
Gentoo Linux
Kernel 2.6test8 from kernel.org
apmd-3.0.2-r3
Suspend with ACPI is with "echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep" working but I can't 
resume. Here it is the same with and without X.
I tried to get help in several other Mailinglists but the problem isn't solved 
yet.
Is here anyone who can help me?
Thanks
Olli
