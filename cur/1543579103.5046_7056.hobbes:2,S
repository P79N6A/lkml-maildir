I have seen this message, new with 2.4.0-2mdk
(before I have 2.4.0-0.15mdk)
but only on one PC.
I have 2 PC, with same hardware, same PCMCIA config
The first have mandrake 7.2 Odissey, and the modules
floppy and floppy_cs are loaded, and /mnt/floppy is mounted
The second have mandrake 7.1 Helium, and the modules
fail during init. and I have this message:
'mount: /dev/fd0 has wrong major or minor number'
Problem of compatibility of some library?
