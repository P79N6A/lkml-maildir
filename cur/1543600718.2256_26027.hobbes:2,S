Hi,
here's my data regarding the K7 optimisation problem.
Until last week I had a 1GHz Athlon with 133MHz FSB. I then bought a
1.4GHz Athlon, again 133MHz FSB.
I never had any problems with the 1GHz processor, but as soon as I
stuck the 1.4GHz processor in, the kernel oopsed itself to
oblivion. (That was with kernel 2.4.5-ac5, approximately)
I also noticed that the computer booted ok with the Debian
bootfloppies, which use a kernel compiled for i386. So after several
kernel compile/boot cycles, I found out that I had to disable K7
optimisation to make the system boot again.
The mainboard is a Tyan Trinity KT-A (S2390B) with a VIA KT133A
chipset.
After reading here that it may be the PSU, I upgraded my 300W PSU to a
431W Enermax, which made no difference.
The only difference I can make out between the working and the
non-working CPU is the internal clockspeed of the CPU and the
stepping (old: 2, new: 4).
Appended is the output of /proc/cpuinfo (I sold the old CPU, but the
guy who bought it sent me the output).
I really hope this helps someone. If anyone needs any more data, or
wants me to test something, contact me.
Yours,
 leo
