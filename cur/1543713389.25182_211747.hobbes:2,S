It all comes back to me now.  The reason there is a __GFP_REPEAT in the
pte_alloc_one() implementations is that lots of architectures used to do
stuff like this:
static inline pte_t *
pte_alloc_one_kernel(struct mm_struct *mm, unsigned long addr)
{
	int count = 0;
	pte_t *pte;
	do {
		pte = (pte_t *)__get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL);
		if (pte)
			clear_page(pte);
		else {
			current->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE;
			schedule_timeout(HZ);
		}
	} while (!pte && (count++ < 10));
	return pte;
}
That was all removed and the __GFP_REPEAT flag was added instead, as a "try
really hard" hint to the page allocator.
