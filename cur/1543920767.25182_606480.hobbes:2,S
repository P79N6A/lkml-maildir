Of _course_ you can trigger that - just open two files and have write
on one of them while another gets closed.
That is certainly possible, but it has nothing whatsoever with the
race you've described - you have two different objects and method
call on one of them might happen when destructor is called on another.
You have protection against ->release() for a struct file called
while you are in ->write() for _same_ struct file.
