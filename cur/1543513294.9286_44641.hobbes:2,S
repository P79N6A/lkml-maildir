Using less tools is simplier and cleaner way in MOST cases ...

nasm is a GOOD assembler and we can use it. It hasn't got the so called
AT&T horrible syntax (TM) ... I started to code in assembly a long time ago
on my C64 but I don't understand anything from Linux kernel written in assembly
because of that sily syntax ... It has got many possiblities to do mistake as
well : intel format (which is used by nasm as well) is much cleaner and nice.
However supported CPUs by NASM is limited to x86 which is not too good for
Linux kernel source :(
