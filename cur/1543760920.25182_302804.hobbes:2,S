The following four patches provide the last needed changes before the
introduction of sparsemem.  For a more complete description of what this
will do, please see this patch:

Three of these are i386-only, but one of them reorganizes the macros
used to manage the space in page->flags, and will affect all platforms.
There are analogous patches to the i386 ones for ppc64, ia64, and
x86_64, but those will be submitted by the normal arch maintainers.
The combination of the four patches has been test-booted on a variety of
i386 hardware, and compiled for ppc64, i386, and x86-64 with about 17
different .configs.  It's also been runtime-tested on ia64 configs (with
more patches on top).
