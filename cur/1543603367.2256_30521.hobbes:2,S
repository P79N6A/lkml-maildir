exactly. auto-mitigation will not hurt NAPI-enabled devices the least.
Also, auto-mitigation is device-independent.
perhaps Jamal misunderstood the nature of my patch, so i'd like to state
it again: auto-mitigation is a feature that is not triggered normally. I
did a quick hack yesterday to include kpolld - that was a mistake, i was
wrong, and i've removed it. kpolld was mostly an experiment to prove that
TCP network connections can be fully functional during extreme overload
situations as well. Also, auto-mitigation will be a nice mechanizm to make
people more aware of the NAPI patch: if they ever notice 'Possible IRQ
overload:' messages then they can be told to try the NAPI patches.
