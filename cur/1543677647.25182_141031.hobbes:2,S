   One possible suggestion would be to submit more than one stdmsgs.h
   files.  One a legacy file, and one that is more consistent from
   message to message.. shooting for a gradual migration.
Let me know when you're back on planet earth ok?
Standardizing strings is an absolutely FRUITLESS exercise.
If you want events, standardize events and push them over
a queueing based communications channel to userspace, namely
using netlink sockets.
