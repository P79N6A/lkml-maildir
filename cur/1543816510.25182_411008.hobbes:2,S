That's a tradeoff. You either version the headers just like I did, meaning 
that a given version corresponds to a given kernel, but that means you can't 
release before all of the archs are fully updated (and not relying on a 
single person to do all of the updates is one of the points of the exercise; 
and with more people, one can have delays) or you're forced to figure out 
some other way to version the headers.
