Hmm, strange. My PCI-Mode is (Any), I have APIC enabled
CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC=y
CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
And I use SCSI. 
I do not have any Problems. Do you have these Problems under heavy
load, or when your machine is idle?

Hmm. hdparm -d1 should AFAIK always speedup your IDE-HD
I have about 6MB/s without and about 26 MB/s using DMA

Dont know. Try to find out e.g. with xosview, which shows you
interupts...
