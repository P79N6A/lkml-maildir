Excellent. One last step - can you verify that just reverting this commit 
makes your problems go away?
IOW, just do
	git bisect reset
to get out of bisect mode, and then do
	git revert 31168481c32c8a485e1003af9433124dede57f8d
and check that the end result is all good?
That's just to double-check that the revert is sufficient, but also 
because "git bisect" is very sensitive to false information (ie if it 
happens that a bug sometimes is not entirely repeatable, then a single 
wrong "git bisect bad/good" will result in the pinpointed commit being 
possibly totally the wrong one).
And Al - can you double-check that commit?
