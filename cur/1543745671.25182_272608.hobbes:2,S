Btw, does wine ever _use_ PTRACE_SINGLESTEP for any of the things it does?
If it does, then that woulc certainly explain why my "fix" made no 
difference: my fix _only_ handles the case where the ptracer never 
actually asks for single-stepping, and single-stepping was started 
entirely by the program being run (ie by setting TF in eflags from within 
the program itself).
But if wine ends up using PTRACE_SINGESTEP because wine actually wants to 
single-step over some instructions, then the kernel will set the PT_DTRACE 
bit, and start tracing through signal handlers too. The way Wine doesn't 
want..
