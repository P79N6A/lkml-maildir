it's about rates... you can hose your system so bad that nothing can fix
it.
the "distro" stuff probably succeeds 10% of the time in non-artificial
cases, the kexec one has the potential at least to go 90% (so yes I
admit that I pull these numbers out of my backside but I'm with Gerrit
on this one). The stuff the distros ship is also not so nice in that you
can't dump to LVM or SAN or ... etc; kexec gets all that right. It's
also far more an all-or-nothing thing; if you make the transition you
know you're going to get a good dump; most of the other dumps die
halfway in the process at some point.
