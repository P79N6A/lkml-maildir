Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
This patch adds support for an enhanced Trusted Path Execution (TPE)
subsystem relying in the Linux Security Modules framework.
It's a rewrite of the IBM's TPE LSM module by Niki A. Rahimi, which adds
a couple of improvements and feature enhancements.
The most notable of them are support for per-gid basis access control
lists in runtime and kernel-configuration time (adds support for trusted
and untrusted user groups), procfs interface for statistics and runtime
information and debugging capabilities (for limiting the garbage
messages).
Also, the documentation has been rewritten and under the "Trusted Path
Execution (EXPERIMENTAL)" configuration option, has been added a "GID
for trusted users" key to make possible to set a default gid for a
specific trusted user group.
The reasons that give sense for including this, are that standard
Vanilla kernels have SELinux and LSM (SELinux already supports TPE
functionalities), but SELinux has less possibilities of being used by
those desktop or just not experienced users who are not already using
their distribution-specific SELinux implementation, even if they want
simple protections for their every-day system use, also, the
availability of some patch-sets with security enhancements (like
grsecurity) distracts users of being using the LSM framework or even
SELinux itself, in addition, this TPE has more features than
grsecurity's one in terms of per-users and groups acl basis, which make
easy the management of the TPE protection.
In short, after a first review you can see that it could worthy to
include this in the kernel sources.
Note: the code, as it is right now, has some limitations that would be
solved in a relatively short time manner, more short if more people
contribute to it.
The limitations of the current code are described
in ./Documentation/tpe-lsm.txt
Patch against 2.6.10 attached.
(not inside msg body for preventing messing up by archives-managing
software)
I will make available an independent-packaged version ASAP, which could
be built outside the kernel sources, at 
http://selinux.tuxedo-es.org
Cheers,
PS: I would appreciate to be CC'ed, as I'm not subscribed to the list.
(Just for mail traffic volume reasons, which i don't have time to
handle)

+Trusted Path Execution Linux Security Module
+Copyright (C) 2003 IBM Corp. <narahimi@us.ibm.com>
+Copyright (C) 2005 Lorenzo Hernandez Garcia-Hierro <lorenzo@gnu.org>
+Author: Lorenzo HernÃ¡ndez Garcia-Hierro (Original: Niki Rahimi)
+This file is distributed according to the GNU General Public License.
+This module was tested on the Linux kernel 2.6.9 and 2.6.10.
+
+The purpose of the Trusted Path Execution Linux Security Module is to enable a
+check in the Linux kernel to limit the running of executables in trusted paths
+so that the potential for malicious code to be run on the system is reduced.
+A trusted path is one in which the parent directory of a file is owned by root
+and is neither group nor other writeable. 
+The module relies on a kernel hook which checks to see if the given path is
+trusted or not and who is the user (or group member) that caused the event (execution).
+This check takes place directly upon an attempt to execute the code by using the 
+bprm_set_security hook. 
+
+Limitations: Right now, the engine does not use the bprm_secureexec hook to 
+prevent use of sensitive LD_* variables by untrusted users or groups, also it
+does not use mmap nor mprotect LSM hooks that could prevent bypass of the
+bprm_set_security checks, as commented by Stephen S. Smalley <sds@epoch.ncsc.mil>.
+This features would be developed ASAP, but it's not a critical, blocking issue.
+
+The module also creates two Trusted Path access control lists which can be accessed
+by a sysfs mountpoint, inside the ./tpefs/ subdir (ie: /sys/tpefs), writeable by root,
+who can add and delete uids (user id's) and a entire range of users using the (new) native
+support for per-gid (group id) basis access control lists. A user on the list is 
+considered trusted.
+Also, it creates a procfs entry called "tpe" (ie: /proc/tpe) which provides
+version information, total amount of trusted users, total amount of trusted groups and
+other information, depending on the code revision), and those who want extra garbage
+from the kernel will like to enabled debugging by passing debug=1 to the module parameters.
+By default, root is hard coded onto this list with also a trusted gid
+which gets automatically added when selecting the "GID for trusted users" option in kernel
+configuration (SECURITY_TPE_TRUSTED_GID).
+
+Thus if user A attempts to run an executable in path A, the following scenarios
+can play out:
+
+1. Trusted user,trusted path 			= User is able to run the executable.
+2. Trusted user,trusted path,trusted group	= User is able to run the executable.
+3. Trusted user,untrusted path  		= User is able to run the executable.
+4. Trusted user,untrusted path,trusted group	= User is able to run the executable.
+5. Trusted user,untrusted path,untrusted group	= User is able to run the executable.
+6. Untrusted user,trusted path	 		= User is able to run the executable.
+7. Untrusted user,trusted path,trusted group 	= User is able to run the executable.
+8. Untrusted user,trusted path,untrusted group 	= User is able to run the executable.
+9. Untrusted user,untrusted path		= User is not able to run the executable.#
+10. Untrusted user,untrusted path,trusted group	= User is able to run the executable.
+11. Untrusted user,untrusted path,untrusted group= User is not able to run the executable.#
+
+In short, if the path and user are both untrusted (and also if the group
+is untrusted), execution will be denied sending a message with the uid,gid,
+euid,egid,pid and binary that caused the event.
+
+In order to actually modify the access control list for TPE, the module uses
+a sysfs subsystem called tpefs. The tpefs contains four files; add, del, add-group
+and del-group.
+Performing read and write operations on the aforementioned files creates a user
+to system interface that will alter the TPE access control list. See 
+"Modifying the TPE Access Control Lists" below for the methods of altering the list 
+using these files.
+Note: The original two file approach was utilized rather than a single file in order to
+keep the code and administration of the module simple for both the kernel and
+the user, and it was when only uid-based access control lists were supported, now
+i've followed the same style to provide backwards compatibility.
+
+Installation: 
+1. Recompile the kernel to include LSM and TPE as a module (or even get a
+   kernel-independent packaged TPE module.
+2. mount -t sysfs sysfs <mountpoint>
+3. modprobe tpe debug=1/0 (if you want to use debugging set to 1)
+4. See "Modifying the TPE Access Control Lists" below  for instructions on how to 
+add/delete users and groups to/from the list.
+
+Modifying the TPE Access Control Lists:
+
+- Adding a user		: echo <uid> > <mountpoint>/tpefs/add
+- Deleting a user	: echo <uid> > <mountpoint>/tpefs/del
+- Adding a group	: echo <gid> > <mountpoint>/tpefs/add-group
+- Deleting a group	: echo <gid> > <mountpoint>/tpefs/del-group
+- Show uid list to userspace: cat <mountpoint>/tpefs/add
+- Show gid list to userspace: cat <mountpoint>/tpefs/add-group
+- Show version and statistics information: cat /proc/tpe
+
+Note: Advanced users would be interested in writing a script or something
+to modify the access control lists in a fine-grained manner, but this is out
+of the goals of the TPE development, anyway, feel free to send your contributions
+to lorenzo@gnu.org.

+ * the original project to fit within the constraints of the LSM framework
+ * and so it should be noted that this is not the same project. Also,
+ * the module makes use of the sysfs filesystem. 
+ * I rewrote the module in order to add debugging, better information
+ * outputting, support for per-User-Groups access control lists at runtime
+ * and kernel-configuration level, a procfs interface for general information
+ * gathering from the TPE subsystem and a few other enhancements which make the
+ * code almost a complete rewrite.

+ * Trusted Path Execution Security Module
+ *
+ * This module provides a Trusted Path Execution (TPE) engine to the
+ * Linux kernel. TPE originated as a kernel patch to OpenBSD 2.4 by
+ * route|daemon9 and Mike Schifman (see Phrack 54). IBM originally modified
+ * the original project to fit within the constraints of the LSM framework
+ * and so it should be noted that this is not the same project. Also,
+ * the module makes use of the sysfs filesystem. 
+ * I rewrote the module in order to add debugging, better information
+ * outputting, support for per-User-Groups access control lists at runtime
+ * and kernel-configuration level, a procfs interface for general information
+ * gathering from the TPE subsystem and a few other enhancements which make the
+ * code almost a complete rewrite.
+ *
