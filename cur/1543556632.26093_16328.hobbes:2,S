No...  The problems showed themselves a little more subtly than that,
although in the pre5 version there was potential for schedule_task tasks to
be queued before the kernel thread which handles them was started.
This shouldn't normally be a problem, but it becomes a fatal problem if
someone tries to schedule a task and then synchronously waits
for it to complete, as the new exec_usermodehelper does.
This change didn't affect module loading per-se.  But the
kernel does try to run /sbin/hotplug from deep within sys_insert_module
and sys_delete_module, so they're related.
