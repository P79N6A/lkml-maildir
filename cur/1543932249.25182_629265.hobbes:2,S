Sure, I'll review it. It is very helpful to me.
Please Cc: or To: the parsons who are listed in this mail.
Jim, if you can review the fixes which you've suggested,
could you give him your signed-off?

 please do so. we'd like to reduce ifdefs as less as possible:-)

Could you also add below?
- fix some comments (it clarifies the meanings of the code)
- add fix_riprel(). this useful to reduce ifdefs.
- expand reenter_kprobe(). I think it treat above two blocks.
- reassignment of regs->ip in kprobe_handler can be unified
  to "regs->ip = (unsigned long)addr;"
