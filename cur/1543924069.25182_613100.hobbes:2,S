The main interest seems to be to protect from mixed printk output
between different CPUs in process context. I don't think it would be
that bad if interrupts come and output error messages in the middle of a
printk, isn't it ?
therefore, could we do something like :
if (!in_irq())
  spin_lock(&logbuf_lock);
...
if (!in_irq())
  spin_unlock(&logbuf_lock);
? (yes, this is a crazy idea)
