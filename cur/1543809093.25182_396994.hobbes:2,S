Here are some i2c and hwmon patches for 2.6.16-rc3.  They all fix bugs
that are currently present in the tree.  All but one of these patches
have been in the last few -mm releases.
Please pull from:

or from:

The full patch series will sent to the sensors mailing list, if anyone
wants to see them.
thanks,
