I'd say your NBD based XFS filesystem is having trouble.

Ok, I've never heard of a problem like this before and you are doing
something that very few ppl are doing (i.e. XFS on NBD). I'd start
Hence  I'd start by suspecting a bug in the NBD driver.

And is this the only place where you see the problem? Or are there
other stack traces that you see this in as well?

That does not sound good. What happens when it does run out of memory?
Is that when you start to see the above corruptions?
