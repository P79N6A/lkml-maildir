Hmm.. Interesting.
However, you seem to be moving only the task structure pointer into the
new interrupt stack thread info, which seems to ignore all the "flags"
things.
So, as far as I can tell, we now get a nasty aliasing issue on
"current_thread_info()->flags", and information like NEED_RESCHED and
SIGPENDING end up being set in the wrong place. They get set on the
_interrupt_ thread_info, not the "process native" thread_info.
Or did I miss some subtlety?
Note that some of this may be hidden by the fact that not everybody uses
the "current_thread_info()" thing, most people still use the old format
"tsk->thread_info".
For example: "set_need_resched()" -> "set_thread_flag(TIF_NEED_RESCHED)"
-> "set_bit(fTIF_NEED_RESCHED,&current_thread_info()->flags)".
So any interrupt causing a "set_need_resched()" would appear to not do the
right thing now.
Comments? We can deprecate "current_thread_info()", but that would make
some things slightly less efficient.
