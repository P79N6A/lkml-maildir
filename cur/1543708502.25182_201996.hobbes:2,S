Well now that we have one input api that can happen. Of course with 
graphics its much more diverse with what you can do. That is one of the 
reasons for so many graphics libraries. It would be really hard to write
a one size fits all library when it comes to graphics.

By state machine I mean the physical hardware state. If it's hardware 
access then it should be in the kernel. Note I'm refering to mode setting 
not acceleration. Now EDID overrides per monitor model and saving the 
state to disk is different. That should be userland.

I think we are fine for whats in the kernel. As for multiple head and 
geometry stuff its not that hard if done right. I have been using 
multi-head systems for years. I have multip desktop systems for years!!!
