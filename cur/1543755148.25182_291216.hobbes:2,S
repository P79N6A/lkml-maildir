That answer isn't good.  No defaults should be that dangerous!
But I suspect that's not really the issue...

With the Synaptics X driver (as supplied by SuSE -- but NOT configured
automatically by the system install tool) and the ALPS parameters in the
README.alps from synaptics-0.14.0, and kernel parameters "usb-handoff"
and "mousedev.tap_time=0", I'm getting somewhat better results in this
particular area.
I see some new "mouse"-specific failure modes though:
  (a) Sometimes tapping automagically generates extra clicks.  For
      example, pressing the delete button once will delete two or more
      mail messages.  Unfortunately it's not actually smart enough to
      only kick in for spam!  (I think this is exclusively when using
      the touchpad itself.)
  (b) Sometimes tapping the left button seems to start half a drag event.
      For example a GUI button's menu pops up rather than performing the
      action associated with the button.  That could be some funky UI
      settings, but it's not consistent ... and I've observed this with
      very quick button presses.  So I think something else is afoot.
  (c) Sometimes tapping seems to only generate a "down" event ... until
      I move the cursor, the "up" doesn't happen.  Again, this is with
      the left button, not the touchpad itself.
I haven't recently seen that nasty "motion emits random mouseclicks"
behavior, but given the way the hardware programs/trains user behavior,
it's hard to say for sure quite yet.
I've not done enough with non-GUI keyboard interactions to say if that
nasty keyboard blockage issue is gone or not; I wouldn't have seen it.

Sounds like "dueling heuristics" here!
I think the behavior I'm now seeing supports that hypothesis.  But
it's hard to say without knowing more about how all the pieces fit
together.
