You are not listening to Peter.  As I understand it from what Peter says 
and your words, your implementation is wrong, and makes fsync 
meaningless.  If so, then you need to fix it.  fsync should not be 
meaningless even for metadata only journaling.  This is a serious bug 
that needs immediate correction, if Peter and I understand it correctly 
from your words.
