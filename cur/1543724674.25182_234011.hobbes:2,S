I've little doubt barriers would provide an alternative;
but I'm hopeless with barriers, so couldn't manage it myself;
and not alone in finding them difficult; and surely more expensive.

Conniptious in some quarters that the name shouts too.  But where does it
appear?  In mm.h, the inlines to hide it from wider gaze.  And just four

I don't think burying it deeper helps anyone.
