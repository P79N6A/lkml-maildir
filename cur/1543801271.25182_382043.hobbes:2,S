Sorry for hijacking the thread, but it is very true. ALSA is just too 
flexible so that the ALSA equivalent (if it indeed exists) of 
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=339951
 cannot be fixed. 
OSS allows specification of device name, and one can set up udev rules 
so that e.g. /dev/dsp-creative it is always a symlink to a SB PCI sound 
card and /dev/dsp-fortemedia is for FM801. Then one can tell xine to 
play sound through /dev/dsp-fortemedia. ALSA accepts only numbers in its 
plughw:x,y,z notation, and applications are unfixable when kernel device 
numbers become random.
