I think it simply means the card can only operate one of the two
modes at one time...

Did you try something like :
ethtool -s eth0 port tp
or
ethtool -s eth0 port mii
as the man page for ethtool says :
       port tp|aui|bnc|mii
              Select device port.
and ethtool indicates it supports :
        ethtool -s DEVNAME \
                [ speed 10|100|1000 ] \
                [ duplex half|full ]    \
                [ port tp|aui|bnc|mii|fibre ] \
where fibre is what you have selected right now (from your report...)
