All the constants defined in tifm_sd.c are used in
accordance to OMAP datasheet with expected effect.
Constants that I've guessed mostly reside in the
tifm.h file and marked accordingly.

I'm not sure it's a good idea. The response value is
returned in 8 16-bit registers, which are mapped over
8 32-bit registers (so that only LS part of each
register is valid). Additionally, the fetch order is
reversed, so cmd->resp[0] is fetched from offsets 24
and 28, while cmd->resp[3] is fetched from offsets 0
and 4. To write this as a loop requires moderately
complex address calculation that may look even less
obvious.

I agree, yet I wanted to retain the names of the
registers as defined in datasheet (so it's easier to
search for them; for some reason it always abbreviates
timeout as TO). Apparently TI does the same in their
drivers.

The OMAP datasheet is somewhat unclear, but I think
that block and byte counters truly represent the
amount of data shifted out to the mmc bus. Whether
this data really reaches the flash memory I don't know
to tell.
