Failed?  Hardly.
The only rulebase policy change Tom Rini was able to identify in a recent
review was the magic behavior of EXPERT with respect to entries without
help.  Which I then removed by commenting out a single declaration.
There is a widespread myth that the CML2 rulebase is lousy with "policy
changes".  I don't know how it got started, but it needs to die now.
Maybe I need to write a CML2 FAQ.
