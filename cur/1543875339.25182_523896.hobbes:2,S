Crappy changelog.  What do these functions do?  What is "safe" about them? 
This is described in neither the changelog nor the code comments, but it
should be described in both.
Also, Andi presently has several MSR patches queued (most prominently
ftp://ftp.firstfloor.org/pub/ak/x86_64/quilt-current/patches/rwmsr-on-cpu
)
but I'm not including them in -mm due to rejects.  If I get a properly
changlogged and commented version of this patch I can merge it, but it
might get wrecked again when the x86_64 tree gets sorted out.
