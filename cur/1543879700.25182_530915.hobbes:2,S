I used a similar sort of queue in the virtual deadline scheduler I
wrote in 2003 or thereabouts. CFS uses queue priorities with too high
a precision to map directly to this (queue priorities are marked as
"key" in the cfs code and should not be confused with task priorities).
The elder virtual deadline scheduler used millisecond resolution and a
rather different calculation for its equivalent of ->key, which
explains how it coped with a limited priority space.
The two basic attacks on such large priority spaces are the near future
vs.  far future subdivisions and subdividing the priority space into
(most often regular) intervals. Subdividing the priority space into
intervals is the most obvious; you simply use some O(lg(n)) priority
queue as the bucket discipline in the "time ring," queue by the upper
bits of the queue priority in the time ring, and by the lower bits in
the O(lg(n)) bucket discipline. The near future vs. far future
subdivision is maintaining the first N tasks in a low-constant-overhead
structure like a sorted list and the remainder in some other sort of
queue structure intended to handle large numbers of elements gracefully.
The distribution of queue priorities strongly influences which of the
methods is most potent, though it should be clear the methods can be
used in combination.
