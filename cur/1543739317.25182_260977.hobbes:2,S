Glibc doesn't use library versioning. It uses *symbol* versioning.
Thus, for some library entry points you now see multiple symbols with the
same name but different versions (ancient vs. old vs. new "struct stat",
16- vs. 32-bit UID, whatever). As long as the header files you compile
against match the library you link to, it all works transparently.
For the library's user, that is. The author's job is harder...
