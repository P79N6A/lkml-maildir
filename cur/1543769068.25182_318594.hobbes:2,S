Yes.  "discontigmem nodes"

Yes, in theory.
A discontig node is just a contiguous area of physical memory.

Correct as well.

I know it's confusing.  I feel your pain :)
You're right, I think you completely want CONFIG_NUMA, not
NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES.  So, toss out that #ifdef, and everything should be
in pretty good shape.  Just don't make any assumptions about how many
'struct zone' or 'pg_data_t's a single "node's" pages can come from.
Although it doesn't help your issue, you may want to read the comments
in here, I wrote it when my brain was twisting around the same issues:

It's not really a flaw in the design, it's a misinterpretation of the
original design as new architectures implemented things.  I hope to
completely ditch DISCONTIGMEM, eventually.

Yeah, ppc64 is not at fault, it just provides the most obvious exposure
of the issue.
