Note that DRDY is not an error:

But moreover, for Serial ATA, timeouts are generally due to platform 
problems, irq problems, or driver problems.  When we see timeouts, we 
generally do not look at the hard drive as the primary cause.
Have you gone through the debugging process for irq problems -- turning 
off ACPI, noapic, etc.?
