Much better format.

Is this something which has not been forward ported from 2.4 to 2.5? Or is
there a serious problem which hasn't bitten me?

Hopefully the core parts of this could make 2.5, allowing final
corrections later.

Sorry to repeat, this seems to be a feature which will be in many if not
most other systems before any possible release date for 2.8. Is it really
that far out? (that's a status request, not a statement)

I really hope this means drivers MAY be used as modules, not MUST. There
is some overhead in doing things as modules, and added complexity usually
means "harder to debug." Particularly with modules where there can be
corner conditions and races on [un]load.
Again, thanks for the status!
