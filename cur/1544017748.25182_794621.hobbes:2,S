piix. hda, so I guess it is old-ide:
piix 0000:00:1f.1: IDE controller (0x8086:0x27df rev 0x02)
pci 0000:00:1f.1: PCI INT C -> GSI 16 (level, low) -> IRQ 16
piix 0000:00:1f.1: IDE port disabled
piix 0000:00:1f.1: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0x1810-0x1817
Probing IDE interface ide0...
hda: UJDA765 DVD/CDRW, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
hda: host max PIO4 wanted PIO255(auto-tune) selected PIO4
hda: UDMA/33 mode selected
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide_generic: please use "probe_mask=0x3f" module parameter for probing
all legacy ISA IDE ports
ide-gd driver 1.18
ide-cd driver 5.00
ide-cd: hda: ATAPI 24X DVD-ROM CD-R/RW drive, 2048kB Cache
Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.20
If I try to access cdrom after undocking, I get:
hda: status error: status=0x20 { DeviceFault }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hda: Strange, packet command initiated yet DRQ isn't asserted
hda: status error: status=0x20 { DeviceFault }

...something similar scrolls when it hangs during s2ram, but it is too
fast to read.

Will try...
