Andre, I see the thought, but surely this is prine to races and other 
difficulties.
Wouldn't it be better to provide an IDE ioctl() that enables the caller to use 
set the SCSI transport on an open FD, so your sequence becomes:
 open(/dev/hdX)
 ioctl(transform_subdriver_scsi)
 ioctl(scsi_ops)
 write(data)
 close(/dev/hdX)
