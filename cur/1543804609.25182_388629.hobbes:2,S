I was wondering about that myself too:  in current code, pgd_page() and
pud_page() deviate from pmd_page and pte_page in terms of symmetry.  The
first two return virtual address of the pgd_val or pud_val, while pmd_page
and pte_page both return point of struct page of underlying entry.  Is
the asymmetry intentional?
Because the way shared page table uses pgd_page and pud_page, it causes
every arch who wants to enable the feature to redefine pgd_page and
pud_page, not exactly nice though.
