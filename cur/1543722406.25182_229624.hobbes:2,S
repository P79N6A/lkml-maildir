As far as we understand the problem you describe we do not see this as a
problem.
The patch keeps track of the TSCs of each CPU separately and only uses
the differences of values read on the same CPU. At least that was our
intention, but maybe we overlooked something. Can you point us to the
places in our patch where this problem occurs?
Best regards
