Umm, no, copy on capture needs to get enabled again as soon as we get
past issues outsiders care about, and start dealing again with improving
the code in the ways we think matter.  There are real problems that are
addressed by copy on capture.  That it has not been worked on since
2.6.5 just sadly indicates how successful folks have been in distracting
us for so long.
vs, open a bug report in bugzilla for copy on capture, and after we get
merged please make copy on capture work.
