Bad luck for you.  See Linus comments about binary-only modules +
compatibility.  There is simply no way around a ifdef here and there for
different kernel versions because a driver IMHO should be maintained for
both current stable and current hacker kernels.

Why this needs to be in the kernel?  Simply ship a copy of the header
file with both application and driver or require the driver being
installed to build the application.  Once you've worked out good,
working interfaces they can go into the kernel headers.  You don't need
that for experimental stuff.

With argument passing using strings instead of structs you have the
versioning issues to, they only show up in other ways.  I'd expect it
becomes harder to debug because the failures are more subtile.  With a
obsolete ioctl struct you likely get back -EINVAL, which is quite
obvious if the application does sane error checking.  Or the application
doesn't even compile.  Both are IMHO much better than some stange
behaviour at runtime, which is the failure pattern I'd expect with API
changes when passing parameters using strings.

I don't believe this until I've seen that working in real live.

But bttv supports the v4l(2) API.  If bttv can handle the poll without
much extra code, what exactly was the point in arguing against the
select support defined in the v4l2 API?
