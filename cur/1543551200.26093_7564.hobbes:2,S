Why are you using an out-of-date development kernel? I don't understand 
this. Is there any particular reason to use something about half an year
old and just drop the last six month of development (and probably exactly
the bugfixes for bugs you are experiencing).
Try to get a current (2.4.0-test9, or -test10-preX) revision, and if you
are still experiencing any problems, report them.
