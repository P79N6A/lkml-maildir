Hi,
I have one problem about this:  after the srvTcp->tsk is set to NULL
(maybe the thread is  still there, isn't it?), is the kthread still
needed to be stopped by calling kthread_stop()? If it is true, then
the task_struct should be saved before send_sig like my patch:
                        if (srvTcp->tsk) {
+                               struct task_struct * tsk = srvTcp->tsk;
                               send_sig(SIGKILL,srvTcp->tsk,1);
-                               kthread_stop(srvTcp->tsk);
+                               kthread_stop(tsk);
Regards
dave
