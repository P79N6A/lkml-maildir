Keep this age old piece of military wisdom in mind, one of the best ways to
destroy your enemy is to divide and conquer him.  Look at the battle between
KDE and GNOME; in the end it has just delayed the adoption of a standard
advanced Windowing system.  This could have been done six months ago; in the
end it will be done.  Instead we have reviews of Redhat stating great in
catagory after catagory; until it comes to the windowing interface last
label (from what I remember) "looks like Windows 95 and the Common Desktop
Eviroment after a bad train wreak."  This is not something new users like to
see.
