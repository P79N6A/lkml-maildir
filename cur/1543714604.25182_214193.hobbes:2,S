Hi all,
Well, seems I have a penchance for causing trouble ;-)
I was playing around with the new beta driver, and was trying to remove
some logical drives using the dellmgr utility.
Well, something between the driver and the BIOS got unhappy, and all of
a sudden I got about 20 of the following lines:
assertion failed:(spin_is_locked(adapter->host_lock)), file: drivers/scsi/megaraid.c, line: 3061:megaraid_abort_handler
followed by (copied by hand... maybe I should set up a serial console :-):
bad: scheduling while atomic!
