Linux always (for as long as select(2) existed?) supported select(2) on
regular files. But why would you use it? select(2) on regular files is
absolutely useless and uninteresting (imagine a person who always says
"YES!" to any question you ask).
The reason why they are uninteresting is from Single UNIX v2 spec that
dictates:
      File descriptors associated with regular files always select true
      for ready to read, ready to write, and error conditions.
