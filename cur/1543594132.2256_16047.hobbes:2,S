Everything you propose to get rid of are DRIVERS.  They
do NOT complicate the core kernel, do NOT introduce bugs
in the core kernel and have absolutely NOTHING to do with
how simple or maintainable the core kernel is.
All of the arguments you give above are irrelevant to the
things you propose to have removed from the kernel.

They have that option NOW, but in the future people may no
longer be interested in doing essential things like security
updates or network protocol updates to older kernels.
Also, forcing people to use these older kernels will only ADD
to the maintenance problems of the Linux kernel, instead of
making them less ... since then we'd have to release security
and network protocol updates against more kernel versions.
It would also make it impossible for people to combine new and
old hardware in one machine. Think of ham radio operators or
physics people who have their own home-brewn hardware for packet
radio or data acquisition.
It's not your arguments or the things you propose that make me
think you're a troll. It's the fact that the things you propose
are completely unrelated to the arguments you give for them ;)

Rik
