correct.

i still consider it a 'quirky' locking construct, because disabling 
interrupts for a long time also disables all other devices sharing the 
same IRQ line - not nice.
Also, this is a really hard case for lockdep to detect automatically. 
(fortunately it's also relatively rare)
OTOH, the straightforward lockdep workaround would be to take the 
spinlock and thus disable all local interrupts - not too nice either. 
Albeit in some ways it's still a bit nicer conceptually than disabling 
the irq line, because other CPUs are still operational, and under 
certain locking designs [preempt-rt] spin_lock_irq() does not disable 
local interrupts.
Steve, can you think of any better solution? I dont have this card.
