The old SCSI code won't be fixed.  It will just be made totally obsolete
by the better generic block layer code.  I personally hope that a year
from now, if somebody wants to do a new SCSI driver, he won't even
_think_ about using the SCSI code, the driver will just take the
(generic SCSI) requests directly off the block queue. 
Death to middle-men that can't do a good job anyway.
