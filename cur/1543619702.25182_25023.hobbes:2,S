Do I understand correctly that there is no clean way right now to change
cpus_allowed of a task (except for current)? In the old scheduler it was
enough to set cpus_allowed and need_resched=1...

I understand your point about crossing calls. Besides this I still think
that set_cpus_allowed() does the job, after all wait_task_inactive() has
to return sometime. But of course, the target CPU shouldn't spend this
time in an interrupt routine.
What if you just 'remember' the task you want to take over on the target
CPU and do the real work later in sched_tick()? After all the task to be
moved has the state TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE and should be dequeued soon. In
sched_tick() then one would check whether the array field is NULL instead
of wait_task_inactive()...

Hmmm, some things could be useful to see from outside. rq->nr_running, for
example.
