Perhaps you need to reread a book like K&R, second edition, to find out
what the C language promises you and what it doesn't.
The bounded-pointer approach represents a C pointer as three machine
pointers.  When you cast to unsigned long, it converts the "value"
pointer.  When you cast an unsigned long to a pointer, you lose the range
information, so the pointer's extent is anywhere in memory.  However,
if the compiler can determine by dataflow analysis where this value
came from it is entitled to put the original range information back.

The C language standard defines quite precisely what the compiler is
allowed to assume and what it is not allowed to assume.  If you don't
like these rules, you will dislike *all* modern C compilers, especially
the expensive proprietary C compilers hardware vendors often use to
get good SPEC results.
