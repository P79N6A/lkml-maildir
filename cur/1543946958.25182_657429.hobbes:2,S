I'll get to it, but I have too many things on my plate at the moment. KAMEZAWA
also wanted to look at it. I looked through some vmalloc() internals yesterday
and I am worried about allocating all the memory on a single node in a NUMA
system and changing VMALLOC_XXXX on every architecture to provide more vmalloc
space. I might be missing something obvious.
