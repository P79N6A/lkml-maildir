Well, I've been reading the 2.5.31 code, and it looks like if
the block device node is opened O_DIRECT and it has an
i_mapping->a_ops->direct_IO method, then file systems will use it
for read/write and won't go thorgh VMS.  I'll investigate.
Does anyone have a pointer for where to go in the 2.4 code?
