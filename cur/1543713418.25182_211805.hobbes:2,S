Thats very odd - the SGI CVS 2.4 kernel (that you reported
working) is also at 2.4.25, and there's nothing in the XFS
fixes/updates there that might be the cause of this, AFAICT.
ACLs are not in Marcelo's tree, but that is unlikely to be
the cause here (both cases are well tested).  The only other
thing I can suggest is a liberal sprinkling of printks on
the sys_open path, till you find the spot thats returning
this error..
cheers.
