Hrm, it does not report BTN_BACK events, but it is present in the bit
mask, however we could refuse to set the bit if the quirk is present.
As far as not depending on the BTN_BACK being assigned as such, I'm not
quite sure how to tell the event handler which one to use without
an additional field somewhere.
That said, I have not gotten my head around the entirety of the HID
layer, so I could very easily be missing something obvious.
