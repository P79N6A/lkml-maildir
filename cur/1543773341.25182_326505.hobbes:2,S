Using Knoppix instead of a Fedora rescue image, I was able to do a reverse 
dd_rescue and already recovered 25GB from the 160GB disk, it now is having 
some (155 now) bad blocks, but I hope it recovers from that (as it already 
managed to do that after the first 55 bad blocks).
Still I'm wondering why on boot it is able to read the partition table, 
but not when booted. Knoppix has the same issue.
