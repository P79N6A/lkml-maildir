I am not sure if I understand what you saying... Are you saying that you
tried GPM with proper evdev support and you are seeing some issues or that
you do not believe that GPM should be touched at all?

Because some people do not want tapping and some people do not like
default sensitivity and some like having virtual scrolling while other
want to have different actions assigned to corner taps.

You do not need to wait for 2.6.12:
	modprobe psmouse proto=exps
or boot with "psmouse.proto=exps" if mouse is built as a module.
On a bit tangent note - anyone is willing to test resync patches? I do not
have access to ALPS touchpad and that's the one piece of hardware that does
not want to play nicely...
