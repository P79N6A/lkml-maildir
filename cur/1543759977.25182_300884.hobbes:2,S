Hmmmm.... can you try to following just to exclude some theories:
Run it with 4000 sockets and then do the following on the server-machine:
dd if=/dev/zero of=file1 bs=1M count=1024
dd if=/dev/zero of=file2 bs=1M count=1024
dd if=/dev/zero of=file3 bs=1M count=1024
cat file1 > /dev/zero & cat file2 > /dev/zero & cat file3 > /dev/zero &
I THINK it might have something to do with caching-pressure or so. See if there is a slow-down on 
the sending if the page-cache gets full and has to be cleared again.
You are running 2.6.11?
