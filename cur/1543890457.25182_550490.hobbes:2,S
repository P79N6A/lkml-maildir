Heh. Have I mentioned how much I *hate* those kernel threads being frozen?
Just for fun, could you try if the patch that just rips out the freezer 
calls from the STR code just fixes the problem too (instead of reverting 
that commit?)
It was done by Matthew Garrett <mjg59@srcf.ucam.org>, and you should be 
able to find it in the kernel archives under the subject
	Re: pcmcia resume 60 second hang. Re: [patch 00/69] -stable review
	Message-ID: <20070527184402.GA21161@srcf.ucam.org>
and it would be interesting to hear if that just solves the problem for 
you too.
There's a different (but related to all the same freezer problems) patch 
by Rafael Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>:
	Re: [RFC][PATCH][EXPERIMENTAL] Make kernel threads nonfreezable by default
	Message-Id: <200705291415.31970.rjw@sisk.pl>
which would also be worth trying out.
