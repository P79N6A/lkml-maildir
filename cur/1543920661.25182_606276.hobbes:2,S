You're welcome.
I wonder what are the chances of this patch set making it into 2.6.24.
The cgroup (aka container) folks Paul Menage and David Rientjes are
working with me on the (hopefully) last fix for getting cpusets to work
with the cgroup changes.  This involves how cpusets adapts to CPUs
coming and going from the system due to hotplug/hotunplug or coming and
going from cpusets due to user changes in the cpuset configuraton.
Not surprisingly, the code we are struggling with depends on the CPU
hotplug support, and this present patch set of yours looks to be a
fine improvement to that.
However whatever we do for this last fix has to make it into 2.6.24,
because cgroups themselves are targeted for 2.6.24, and I can't let
that lead to any serious regressions in existing cpuset capability.
