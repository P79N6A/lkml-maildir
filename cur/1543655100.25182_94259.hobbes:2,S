Ok - see my reply to James's post.  I see the point of this given that
there are constraints on DMAable memory which are not related to
consistency (e.g. particular address ranges and cacheline alignment).
A mallocater which can satisfy these constraints makes sense to me.
I just think it's a mistake to associate these constraints with cache
consistency - they are not related.  James's original patch does make
this separation in practice, but it misleading suggests a link - which
is what confused me.

I imagine platforms where any address is DMAable and which are fully
consistent would do this.
