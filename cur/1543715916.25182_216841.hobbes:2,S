I recall some earlier messages where some crucial part of memory was
marked 'non-cacheable' in /proc/mtrr, and linux ran very slow. But on
re-reading, your problem is more that linux isn't slow, but bogomips
(and only bogomips) don't seem right?
In that case, you may need the help of a real kernel hacker, not a
piddling amateur like me :-)
Good luck,
Jurriaan
