Excellent.

I'll give it a try this evening; the test box is an
FC5 upgrade guinea pig at the moment, and only half-migrated.

Yes, I agree that that the latency issue is not due to the inb(),
as I get lost ticks almost continuously at 1 KHZ, and the inb()-related
latency occurs with much lower frequency.
However, a 17ms inb() latency is rather dismal, and I need to
address that hardware issue, perhaps by purchasing a 4-port card.
I have not been chasing the other issue because the test box appears to
keep perfect time with the -rt patch (on SMP) and NTP doesn't complain at
all; I haven't yet had the chance to determine whether that is entirely
due to John Stultz's new code, or if the preemption is responsible.
