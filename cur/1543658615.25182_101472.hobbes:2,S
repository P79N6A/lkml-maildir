pkirchner has informed me /proc/kcore returns the correct information
in this case on MIPS, and I've also received x86-32/64 confirmation.
64-bit in 32-bit ELF: <pkirchner:#mipslinux>  it does say  abi=674 mips1 not 32bitmode not fp32
DecStation 5000/200: /proc/kcore:     file format elf32-tradlittlemips
