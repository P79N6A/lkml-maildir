I didn't say this, because it is obviously not doing it job correctly.
It needs NAPI to do this.  For now, the driver _should_ stay up, even 
with these 'too much work...' messages.

Quoting from my original reply:
	It's due to the 8139 hardware
Tons of tiny packets can be sent before RTL8139 will throttle, which can 
easily be far more than your system can handle at that particular time, 
especially if it's experiencing high load elsewhere.
You need either NAPI (perfect solution) or "cap interrupt work limit at 
X packets" (stopgap solution) to prevent your 8139 hardware from being 
DoS'd off the network.
