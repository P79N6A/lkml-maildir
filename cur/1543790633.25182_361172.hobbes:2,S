I skim lkml so that's probably not necessary. This complaint just
grabbed my attention since I had made a related change in the area.
I did recall the jiffies issue once you mentioned it, but I'm not
keeping to close a watch as far as what versions of ktimers patches are
in what versions of the -rt tree (Ingo: is there a place where you have
the -rt tree broken out?)
Please do be sure to CC me if you run into any timekeeping related
problems, just so I'm sure not to miss them.
thanks!
