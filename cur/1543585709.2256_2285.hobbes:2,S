Change the removable device-drivers to detect change. Fx, with cdrom, change 
the cdrom-part to detect when the disc tray ejects and when it goes back in, 
both for manual (user push eject) and automatic (program sends 
eject-request). This way the kernel just have to send a signal when this 
happens on a device (to processes who have requested to get to know).
This has several advantages:
* Supermount don't need to be kernel-related at all, and so doesn't need to 
be updated for each new kernel revision (cleaner kernel)
* Possible to get autorun on linux
* Can get rid of "insert cd and press ok"-like things (replace with "insert 
cd or press cancel")
* Imagination is the only limit :)
So, what do you say ? (I'm a newbie to this, so don't flame me to hard :)
