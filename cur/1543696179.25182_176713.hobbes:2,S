Yes - setup_irq() fix in 2.4.23-pre8 (arch/alpha/kernel/irq.c) had
fixed IDE hangs on DS10 (verified for 5229 rev c1).  If that doesn't
help, try to narrow it down - try 2.4.21-* + irq.c change and see
where does it stop working.
It should be able to do DMA at boot time, BTW:
wynton:~# dmesg |head -2

DS10 with cdrom on hda and disk on hdc, no ide-related arguments in command
line.  Revision c0 won't do UDMA, but it should be able to do DMA just fine...
What configuration do you have?
