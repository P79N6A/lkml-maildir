Hello,
a short note on todays test cycles.
I switched to rc8 (SMP, apic), took three cycles until it failed.
rc8 (SMP, apic, HIGHIO) failed on the first try.
I thought HIGHIO could make a difference if there were inherent problems with
bounce buffers. Unfortunately this seems not the case.
Anyway it looks like failures have gotten fewer since rc8. I will try an
overnight stress test now to see if I get it freezing again.
Regards,
Stephan
