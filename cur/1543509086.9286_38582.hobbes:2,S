(Possibly out of place on this list, but I think the right people are here.)
I observed that the hardest part of installing Linux on a misc. machine is
configuring the video card/monitor for X (always a problem for desktops) and
configuring sound (sometimes a problem for desktops).
While detection of the chipset and abilities has been progressing pretty well
that there is still a gap in getting the settings reasonable for a particular
implementation of that video card and the present monitor.
It occurred to me that it is probably possible to write a Win98/NT program
that can grab those settings from a running system (configured with card
vendor supplied BIOS/drivers) and save them to a floppy for use in installing
Linux on that box.
I'm speaking generally about the frequency rates, dot clock settings, and
other related configuration.  Even video mode would be something that would
allow the Linux system to start with the same video abilities as the original
OS.
I'd be surprised if this wasn't thought of before; why can't we do this?
