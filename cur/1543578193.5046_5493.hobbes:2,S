Are you saying that this is a hardware bug that is impossible to
develop a work-around for in the kernel?  If this is just a bug,
shouldn't we try to fix it rather than avoid it?
If you have detailed information about the interrupt problem,
perhaps you could send it to the list and see if a fix is possible.
