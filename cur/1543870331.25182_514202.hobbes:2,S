i'm wondering - how can the 'Total transferred' and 'HTML transferred' 
numbers be different?
Since document length is 3521, and the number of requests is 80000, the 
correct 'HTML transferred' is 281680000 - which is the epoll result. The 
kevent result shows more bytes transferred, which suggests that the 
kevent loop is probably incorrect somewhere.
this might be some benign thing, but the /first/ thing you /have to/ do 
before claiming that 'kevent is 25% faster than epoll' is to make sure 
the results are totally reliable.
