Hi Shephen,
I tried this early on, but I just tried it again to
make sure.  There is no noticeable effect from setting
apm=allow_ints at the boot prompt.  So either my
command is not getting set, or the BIOS itself is
restricting the interrupts?  Is there a way to check
that I did indeed allow interrupts?
  I don't know much about BIOS hacking, any
suggestions about how to get the code for the BIOS
(other than disassembling it)?  I bet Dell isn't going
to give it to me.  I am struggling to get them to even
understand the problem.
Thanks,
Mike
