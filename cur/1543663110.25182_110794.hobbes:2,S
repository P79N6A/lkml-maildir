This is incredibly broken, on many layers.
First, formatting does not respect the original code. Pavel, please,
I do not care what crap you write in softsuspend, but this is a
generic piece of code. Be kind to those who come next.
Second, no HZ or other way to specify a wall clock interval.
What if I run with HZ=4000? How do you protect against a
jiffies wraparound?
Third, I do not see how this is supposed to work at all.
What if I hit two letters like in a word "Fool"? The up event
is filtered already by this time, so, won't this code eat
the second 'o'?
