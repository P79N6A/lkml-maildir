I think it would be valuable, especially for embedded developers
when they have trouble getting user space up on a new platform.
Also, it could be something simple and solid.  It's a pain to
set up a remote debug session just to poke around in the kernel.
Remote debug setup is complex and often fragile.
I'd be willing to test this if you get something running, and
give you some feedback.  For me, it would be best if the module
could be statically linked.
How do you plan to handle symbolic information?
