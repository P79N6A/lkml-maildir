Good to hear from you, Nigel!
Should indeed be OK to freeze during suspend/hibernate.  Will my
schedule_timeout_interruptible() be sufficient to allow the freeze
to happen, or do I need to add an explicit try_to_freeze()?
Ah, and I probably need to use the same trick that mtd_blktrans_thread()
does to avoid having all my sleeps killed of by an errant signal:
	spin_lock_irq(&current->sighand->siglock);
	sigfillset(&current->blocked);
	recalc_sigpending();
	spin_unlock_irq(&current->sighand->siglock);
Or is such paranoia unnecessary?
							Thanx, Paul
