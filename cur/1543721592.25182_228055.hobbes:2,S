Not a new one:
| super.c: In function `parse_options':
| super.c:164: warning: `names' might be used uninitialized in this function
| super.c:164: warning: `fork' might be used uninitialized in this function
and it's not a compiler glitch.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
