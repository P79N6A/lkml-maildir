This is just too much CRAP, in my opinion. It's just unacceptably ugly,
and I don't think the compat layer is worth it if it just keeps on growing
barnacles that are as horrible as this.
Why do you have to shout in the code with macro names from hell? 
Make the code _look_ good. Not look like SOMEBODY WHO CANNOT TYPE WITHOUT
THE SHIFT KEY. Make the thing take properly typed arguments, instead of
casting stuff two ways and backwards inside macros.
