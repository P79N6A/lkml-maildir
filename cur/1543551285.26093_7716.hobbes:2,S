OK, let's set a few things straight:
- RH 7 ships a gcc patched from CVS sources in order to take advantage of
  better (on ix86 mainly) optimizations on userland
- RH 7 ships kgcc for compiling the kernel, as the 2.2 kernels are known to
  be broken and not compilable with new gcc's
- No, the kernel won't be fixed. The work is huge, and the risk is much too
  high
- Yes, 2.4 should compile with new gcc's. But then again, it isn't (and
  probably won't be, at least for some time) a supported configuration
