I notice you didn't include the ret_from_syscall race fix which shows
up, rarely but it does.  I think it was the last glitch seen in William
Montgomery's tests with 2.2+lowlatency.

Nice.  That may be small enough to add into __get_user and __put_user.
As tweak you could use a short branch in libcalls.

Excessive.  You don't need anything more than "pushl $1b; jmpl
__cond_schedule" in the offline section, and let __cond_schedule do the
register save/restore.  That's 10 bytes, =3.1k.
(Now if only there was a way to convince the linker to use short jumps to
long jumps per group of 256 bytes, it would be 7 bytes :-) But there
isn't...)
