I installed -rc2 and now the problem
with cd-rom I had in rc1-mm[45], is
also here.
The problem is that any process that is
trying to access the cdrom, gets stuck
in the kernel forever (actually, ~20
minutes after I typed "eject", the tray
was actually finally ejected, so it is not
really forever, but almost so). The
problem doesn't exist in -rc1.
All the relevant info about my cd-rom,
as well as the Alt-PrtSc-t traces are
in my previous report:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0411.1/2026.html
Any ideas what could cause this? If this
is not resolved, I guess under 2.6.10 I'll
not be able to use cd-rom, which would be
really very unfortunate for me :)
Is there any other info I can provide?
