Hi,
	I attach a patch that fixes a minor bug in the coredumping
logic (that happens with multithreaded apps), and also adds support
to 2.3 for generating real multithreaded core dumps (rather than the
current behavior of dumping the image of the non-crashing thread).
This patch only works for i386 and sparc. I need help on the other
platforms to implement 'get_pt_regs_for_task' -- a function that
gets the current saved register set for a task (which isn't the current
task). 
The patch has two components -- one that adds a hook into the toplevel
core dumping code, and one into the ELF core dumper to actually create
the dump. [The 2.3 core dumper removed the capability that was in
2.0ff that allowed a loadable module to implement multithreaded core
dumps. This patch puts that capability back in.]
Enjoy,
	Philip
