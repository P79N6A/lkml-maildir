I created a module in LTTng that uses kallsyms to get the symbol
corresponding to a specific system call address. Unfortunately, all the
unimplemented syscalls were all referring to the (same) weak symbol
identifying an unrelated system call rather that sys_ni (or whatever
non-weak symbol would be expected). Kallsyms was dumbly returning the
first symbol that matched.
This patch makes sure kallsyms returns the non-weak symbol when there is
one, which seems to be the expected result.
