Thanks. Got patch from other message, applied it. No error messages in 1st hour
of uptime. Let's see later (sometimes I should wait a rather long time before
error message from my boobytrap).
About questions from second message:
	I have uniprocessor machine. 
I applied the new boobytrap patch. At least quick look at it tells me that it
should work also for single CPU (I hope I'm right)
