Nor does anybody say or write AT machine. A web search finds 15 times
more occurrences of "LC-Display" on German pages than of "LC display" on
English pages. So it seams my suggestion of "LC display" is a bad one
for usage outside of Germany. BTW, "LCD-Display" is doubly as often
found on German web pages than "LC-Display" on German pages, and I'm not
surprised.
At some point, widely used words and expressions become accepted parts
of a language. "LCD display" however is evidently still considered bad
style --- in English as well as in German. But maybe this stylistic
mistake is more prone to criticism among Germans than among North
Americans. (Perhaps not) coincidentally, the other person who criticized
it in this thread is obviously German too.
