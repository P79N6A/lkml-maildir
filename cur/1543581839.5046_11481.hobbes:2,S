  You should drop this subject as it will only result in flame
wars.  They have in the past and the result is always the same...
1)  XFree86 is about the X window system.  We don't give a damn about
    competing window systems. 
2)  There isn't a single API that can encompass all hardware.
3)  Kernel drivers are OS specific things and XFree86 runs on 
    too many platforms so we won't be able to abandon
    user-space drivers.  At least not any time soon.
   That said, there are fbdev drivers for XFree86 and there are
some hardware-specific solutions like NVIDIA's binary drivers.
If you want to do something else, that's your perrogative. But
don't waste your time trying to get everybody to agree with
you.  I won't happen.
   Sorry to be a bit abrupt, but there have been a few other
discussions of this nature in the past and it's best that it
doesn't go much further.  At least not on XFree86 lists. 
				Mark.
