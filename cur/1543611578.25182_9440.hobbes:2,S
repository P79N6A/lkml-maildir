    Linus,
    Please consider below patch which adds the starting sector and number of
    sectors to /proc/partitions.
    It works fine here and I find having this information output can be very
    useful (especially when the values in the kernel don't match the values
    output by fdisk for example).
Of course this breaks all programs that use /proc/partitions,
like fdisk and mount. Every system that uses mount-by-label will be broken.
