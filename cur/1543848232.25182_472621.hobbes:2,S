the book is quite explenatory, so maybe your uni has it in the library
so that you can try to see if it makes sense?

TLB flush is needed if ANY part of the address space is pointing at
different pages. Since that is always the case for different processes,
where exactly glibc is doesn't matter... as long as there is ONE page of
memory different you have to flush. (And the flush is not expensive
enough to do partial ones based on lots of smarts; the smarts will be
more expensive than just doing a full flush)

the scheduler is smart enough to avoid the flush then afaik
(threads share the "mm" in Linux, and "different mm" is used as trigger
for the flush. Linux is even smarter; kernel threads don't have any mm
at all so those count as wildcards in this respect, so that if  you have
"thread A" -> "kernel thread" -> "thread B" you'll have no flush)
