Send angry email to everyone@mozilla.org.  AFAICT it's impossible with
recent mailnews.
Slightly more on-topic:
+int do_posix_clock_process_gettime(struct timespec *tp);
+int do_posix_clock_process_settime(struct timespec *tp);
+int do_posix_clock_thread_gettime(struct timespec *tp);
+int do_posix_clock_thread_settime(struct timespec *tp);
These should all be given static scope.
And it would be nice to structure the code so the forward decl isn't
needed, if poss.
