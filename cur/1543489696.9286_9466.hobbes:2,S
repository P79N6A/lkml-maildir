Hi Andreas,
I think the person you spoke to was not talking about the Kernel Traffic
forum. They probably meant linux-kernel. You can find out how to join it by
going to 
http://www.tux.org/lkml/
I suspect your kernel was compiled for pentium, and needs to be recompiled
for a 386. I also suspect you'll need some rescue floppies from somewhere. I
get mine from Debian. Forget about copying files from DOS. Boot with the
rescue floppy, mount the hard drive, install the proper kernel, run lilo,
and reboot.
But you'll probably get much stronger help on linux-kernel. I'm ccing them
Zack
