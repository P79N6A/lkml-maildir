    I know 8259. :-)
    It also resets the corresponding IRQ bit in IRR, and sets it in ISR where 
it's then cleared on EOI command.

    This is not implicit -- CPU has to read INTACK reg. on OpenPIC. Really 
implicit method is in action on x86 where CPU issues dual ACK bus cycle to get 
the vector form 8259...

    Thank you, I know. Even 8259 has the notion of priority and EOI works the 
same way here.
