An SGI Altix system that only supports part of the ACPI spec :).  Our
PROM currently doesn't generate any MADT entries other than CPUs (I'm
not even sure how we could add them since we use our own interrupt
controller, not an IOAPIC or IOSAPIC) and lacks an ACPI namespace, so
we're missing all sorts of stuff.
