I think with 8 CPUs and 8 NICs (usual benchmark setup) you want more than 1 cpu
serving static data and it should be more efficient if it's threaded and
sleeping in accept() instead of running eight of them (starting from sharing
tlb entries and avoiding flushes probably without the need of CPU binding).
