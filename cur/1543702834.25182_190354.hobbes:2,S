Whatever it is, its pure speed on this system here, Andrew.  DRM? 
lemme see if thats even turned on.  Nope "# CONFIG_DRM is not set"
Doing a make xconfig, I see that if I turn it on, there is not a 
driver for my gforce2/nvidia, so I naturally turned it back off.
I do have VIA and agpgart enabled just above it, and over in the 
framebuffer menu, support for framebuffer and nvidia/riva are both 
checked.
Anyway, something has made a huge difference in window switching 
speeds here, someplace between 2.6.0-mm2 and 2.6.1-mm1.  I like it.
