Hello, Junjie,
Ran into one of the networking guys off-list.  Apparently, the
synchronize_net() is there out of paranoia.  It might be necessary,
but he could not think of a reason for its being there.  If you want
to shave 30ms off of your boot time by removing it, here is his
suggested test procedure:
o	Write a small dummy protocol as a module.
o	On an SMP machine, have one process repeated modprobe/rmmod
	while another process repeatedly does socket() calls for
	the dummy protocol.
							Thanx, Paul
