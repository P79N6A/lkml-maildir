That was actually pretty broken. Sending Andrew email stopped working
for ages. IIRC because I was sending email from my home address through
the IBM work server. It's not a trouble-free solution, and otherwise
fairly reasonable things stop working. I forget what the OSDL admins
did in the end ... I think put in a specific exception for an IP range.
