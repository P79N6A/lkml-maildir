A few weeks ago I sent linux-kernel an oops trace caused by boot-time
IDE probing weirdness.  Specifically Linux boots with
  hdb: non-IDE drive, CHS=622/64/63
(hdb does not, in fact, exist at all), and in recent 2.3.x, this
misconception causes an oops+hang just after.  I still don't know why
hdb is being "found", but I did manage to prevent the oops:

 	sitre =  (reg4042 & 0x4000) ? 1 : 0;
 	pci_read_config_word(dev, 0x44, &reg44);
(That was against 2.3.18ac8 or so, I believe.)  So: does anyone want to
try and debug why my piix3 seems to be telling Linux it has an hdb?  I
am happy to run test patches but I don't know enough about Linux, the
PC BIOS or IDE to do much more by myself.
