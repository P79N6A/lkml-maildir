Hi there,

Hm, have not checked that. Did you do benchmarks here ?

Hm,
quick check of dgemm or also testgart or gears gives me a 10  to 20
percent increase in speed when compiling with -mcpu=pentium -O2 as
switches for both runs on my duron.
All this reasons are not showing that gcc-2.95.2 is somehow broken.
Please enlighten me.
With best regards
Michael
