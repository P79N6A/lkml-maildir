Yes, sometimes they start pending and sometimes they run immediately.

Of course, things should get slower with higher load, but it should be 
consistent without stalls.
To see this problem, make sure you boot into /bin/sh with the normal VGA 
console (ie. not fb-console).  Then try each loop a few times to show 
different behaviour; loops like:
# for ((i=0; i<3333; i++)); do ping 10.1 -A > /dev/null & done
# for ((i=0; i<3333; i++)); do nice -99 ping 10.1 -A > /dev/null & done
# { for ((i=0; i<3333; i++)); do
        ping 10.1 -A > /dev/null &
    done } > /dev/null 2>&1
Especially the last one sometimes causes a complete console lock-up, while 
the other two sometimes stall then surge periodically.
BTW, I am also wondering how one might test threading behaviour wrt to 
startup and sync-on-exit with parent thread.  This may not show any problems 
with small number of threads, but how does it scale with 1K+?
Thanks!
