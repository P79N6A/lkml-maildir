Well for one you will find that people use different wires in each direction
and those wires also carry different amounts of data and have different
amounts of backhoes in them. They are connected to different pieces of
electronics in each device at the end points too
I'd be -suprised- if a partial failure case (as opposed to the complete failure)
was bidirectional
