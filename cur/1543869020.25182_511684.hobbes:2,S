I'm not sure I understand. What the current implementation does is to
use host based framebuffer memory. Apps mmap that memory and draw to
that. Then after the delay, that framebuffer is written to the
device's memory. That's the scenario for hecubafb where the Apollo
controller maintains it's own internal framebuffer.
When you say without the framebuffer, if you meant without the host
memory, then this method doesn't work. If you mean without the
device's internal memory, then yes, I think we can do that, because it
would be up to the driver to use the touched pagelist to then perform
IO as suitable for its device.
Thanks,
