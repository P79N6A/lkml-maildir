None of the solutions being talked about perform "failing over" in
userland.  The RAID transforms which perform this operation are kernel
resident in DM, MD, and EMD.  Perhaps you are talking about spare
activation and rebuild?

None of the solutions presented here are attempting to make RAID
transforms operate from the boot loader environment without BIOS
support.  I see this as a completely tangental problem to what is
being discussed.
