Well but at least they could find it again if they wanted.
If you sent it by email and it had gotten lost for some reason
(nobody interested, which seems to be the real issue here) then
it would be lost forever.
Of course a database is not a silver bullet by itself, it still
needs people to use it correctly and then actually work on the bugs.
A database just a tool to move some work humans are bad at (keeping track 
of a lot of data and deriving trends out of it) to a a computer which is 
much better at this.
