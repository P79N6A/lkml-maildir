   I don't really want to be chiming in with another 'make it a kiobuf',
   but given that you already have written 'do_tcp_sendpages()' why did
   you make sock->ops->sendpage() take the single page as an argument
   rather than just have it take the 'struct page **'?
It was like that to begin with.  But to do it cleanly you have to pass
in not a vector of "pages" but a vector of "page+offset+len" triplets.
Linus hated it, and I understood why, so I reverted the API to be
single page based.
   I would have thought one of the main interests of doing something
   like this would be to allow us to speed up large writes to the
   socket for ncpfs/knfsd/nfs/smbfs/...
This is what TCP_CORK/MSG_MORE et al. are all for, things get
coalesced perfectly.  Sending in a vector of pages seems nice, but
none of the page cache infrastructure works like this, all of the core
routines work on a page at a time.  It actually simplifies a lot.
The writepage interface optimizes large file writes to a socket just
fine.
