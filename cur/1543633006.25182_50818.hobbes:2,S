[insert floppy]
# dd if=/dev/fd0 of=diskette.image
8+0 records in
8+0 records out
# ls -alF diskette.image

This is obviously wrong. But a second try at it:
# dd if=/dev/fd0 of=diskette.image
2880+0 records in
2880+0 records out
# ls -alF diskette.image
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root      1474560 Jun  6 11:49 test
However:
# tar xvf diskette.image
wget-1.8.1.tar.gz
# cmp wget-1.8.1.tar.gz wget-181.tar.gz
wget-1.8.1.tar.gz wget-181.tar.gz differ: char 7681, line 34
So that's wrong too. This works under RedHat's 2.4.7-10, and has
worked previously in various 2.4 and 2.2 kernels.
I'm willing to help with some testing to figure out the problem; I use
this dd method to make diskette images for customers all the time, and
I will need it fixed for 2.6.x.
Some things I've noticed:
- the 8 records attempt always happens after a new media insertion. To
say it another way, the "good" 2880 attempt only happens on the second
and subsequent attempts on an already inserted floppy.
- I though I'd noticed that this would corrupt the floppy itself, but
have been unable to reproduce. May have been two bad floppies in a row
coincidentally.
