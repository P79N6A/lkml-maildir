Hi.
There's a small glitch when configuring 2.4.20-pre7-ac1. The
problem is in drivers/mtd/devices/Config.in. menuconfig prints
out an error when configuring the kernel due to the following ...
if [ "$CONFIG_DECSTATION" = "y" ];
   dep_tristate '  DEC MS02-NV NVRAM module support' CONFIG_MTD_MS02NV
   $CONFIG_MTD $CONFIG_DECSTATION
fi
The word "then" is missing. The line should look like ...
if [ "$CONFIG_DECSTATION" = "y" ]; then
   dep_tristate '  DEC MS02-NV NVRAM module support' CONFIG_MTD_MS02NV
   $CONFIG_MTD $CONFIG_DECSTATION
fi
