This assumes that you can discover from the file handle which export it 
belongs to. And right, this can be done using the fsid export option. Okay, 
I'm now convinced that passing the vfsmounts from the svc_export to the vfs_ 
helpers is good at least for *something*. I'll update the patches.

Hardlinks are per definition on the same filesystem. This doesn't mean that 
you can't have two filehandles for the same file but with different 
vfsmounts -- you can have the same file visible in multiple locations, each 
with their own vfsmount.
Thanks,
