Whatever is not pinned is moved out of the top cpuset, on the kind of
systems I'm most familiar with.  They are put in a smaller cpuset, with
load balancing, that is sized for the workload they might present, but
kept separate from the main jobs.

We don't do a whole lot of brushing under the carpet on these kind of
systems.  If I gave you the impression we do, then I misled you - sorry.
