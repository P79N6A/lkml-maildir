No, I'll take the damn patch, but quite frankly, I think your arguments 
suck.
I've told you so before, and asked for numbers, and all you do is 
handwave. And this is like the *third*time*, and you don't even seem to 
admit that you're handwaving.
So let's do it, but dammit:
 - make sure there aren't any invalid statements like this in the final 
   commit message.
 - if somebody shows that you were wrong, and points to a real load, 
   please never *ever* make excuses for this again, ok? 
Is that a deal? I hope we'll never need to hear about this again, but I 
really object to the way you've tried to "sell" this thing, by basically 
starting out dishonest about what the problem was, and even now I've yet 
to see a *single* performance number even though I've asked for them 
(except for the problem case, which was introduced by *you*)
