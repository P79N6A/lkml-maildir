Hi,
I'm running the 2.6.11.7 kernel (and others) and all of them have a 
problem with locking up when they try to swap out memory, to a swap 
partition, that is located in an extended partition which is 200G
in size. The same problem does not occur when the swap partition is
a primary partition on the same drive.
Another problem that is probably related, was when I first formatted
the drive using fdisk, and then did a reboot I got a kernel divide by
zero message with cpu register dumps. I can't seem to replicate this
error though.
The software is Fedora Core 2 and the KDE desktop.
Sorry if this is a bit vague, but I'm not sure what type of
information you require to locate the bug.
Regards
Charles Mydlak
