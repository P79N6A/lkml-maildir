Excellent.  I've switched machines here, so my "old" single-core 2GHz notebook
is no longer being used as much.  The new machine is a more or less identical
notebook, but with a 2.1GHz Core2Duo CPU.
And.. man, the mainline scheduler really sucks eggs on the dual-core!
On single core it was nearly always "nice" enough for me,
but wow.. what a degradation with the extra CPU.
So, CFS is now a permanent add-on for kernels I use here on either machine,
and I also can say that it works GGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTT!!!
(please excuse the North American excuse for a "cultural" reference).  ;)
