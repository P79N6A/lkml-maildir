I haven't checked earlier 2.4 kernels, but I know the 2.6 ones have done
this for quite some time; a good year or so at least.

Well, that does require changes to a lot of the programs that talk to the
console, moreover, they now need to be sensitive to whether it is in
UTF-8 mode, where previously they did not. E.g. consider mingetty...
Also, as I understand it, there is one keyboard map, and one console font
for the entire virtual console system - either they are UTF-8, or not. It
doesn't really make sense to be switching these about.
Moreover, this code also affects dynamic creation of new virtual
consoles. E.g. when debian's "oh no, I can't start the X server" ncurses
dialog appears, without my patch it prints UTF-8 characters on a new
console, tty8, on a console that isn't set to display them, and mass
breakage results. Now, it all happens cleanly, because the new console is
already in UTF-8 mode.
Were this to be pushed to userland, every program that outputs data would
need to detect the UTF-8 mode of the console, and set it appropriately.
Moreover, they would need to perform this logic only on a Linux virtual
console; such things as XTerm or Gnome-terminal do it automatically.
