        I suggest you say :
"The box is built by an ADSL provider 'free'[0]. The box is located at
the user end of the ADSL line (i.e. in the appartement of an individual
or in the offices of a company). "
        Later on you could expand on how the box gets there, how
it is installed (lended or not) and the claim of Free that it is 
not lended in any ways.

        I insist that free does not even claim to lend the Freebox. They
claim that the freebox is a terminal equipement of their local network.

        I believe that a customer could ask for the corresponding sources
to Free if she/he got a copy of the binary out of the freebox. Does anyone
have such a binary ?

        Could someone provide a hard proof of this ?

        I'd say this is more a debatable justification than a claim.
