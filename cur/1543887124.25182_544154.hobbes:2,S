futex_wait_pi() takes mmap_sem. So does futex_fd(). I can't see a code 
path into the PI futexes which doesn't use mmap_sem.
There is another way to avoid problems with mmap_sem:
Use shared memory for data you need to share with high priority tasks and
normal low priority tasks there. The high priority task(s) run(s) in 
an isolated high priority process having its own mmap_sem. This high 
priority process is mlock'ed and doesn't do any operations write locking 
mmap_sem.
But it would be nice if you can avoid such a cumbersome workaround...
