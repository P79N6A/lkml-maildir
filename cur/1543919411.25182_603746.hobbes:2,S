I noticed this because you have to specify ARCH for "make headers_install" but 
don't have to specify a CROSS_COMPILE prefix for that because it doesn't 
build anything.  Yet the first line it spits out is a complaint that it can't 
find m68k-linux-gnu-gcc.
I do note that the error message doesn't stop the build, and seems to be 
ignored...

*shrug*  This is the eleventh target I've tried to build, and the first one 
that has this behavior.  It seemed unnecessary at best.
