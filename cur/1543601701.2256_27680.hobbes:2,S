No, write_access means not only that we are trying to write to it, but it
(by implication) means that we have the right too - otherwise we would
have SIGSEGV'd.
Anyway, I'm not at all sure that the write_access test is worth it, we
could just never do it (like your patch), or we could test if we allow COW
and do early COW (which the write-access kind of means).
However, your patch isn't right for another reason: if we do delete it
from the swap cache, we'd better mark it dirty so that it gets
re-allocated a swap entry if it later on needs it.
That's why the old code went to such extremes: it marked it dirty and
writable if it was a write access (and exclusive), and it marked it _just_
dirty and removed it from the swap cache if it went over the swap limit.
Whether that complexity is worth it, I don't know.
