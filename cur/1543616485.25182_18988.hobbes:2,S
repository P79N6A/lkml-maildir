No problem. Autoconfigurator can live without important files.
I.e. no /proc/bus/{pci,usb}, autoconfigurator will ignore such
detections. (it would not say: no PCI cards, but unfortunatelly
it will find only few PCI cards (via /proc/{devices,misc}, if you
have luke)).
BTW: IMHO I can complete the detection, also with ISA cards,
before Eric will start including dmi.
How to handle a driver db with dmi strings and kernel configurations?
It seems to me to complex to try it. We need every possible machine
to extract data.
