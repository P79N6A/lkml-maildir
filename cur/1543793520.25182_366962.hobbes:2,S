Subject: [PATCH] Allow arch to veto PC speaker beeper initialization
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/14/284

From: Michael Neuling <mikey@neuling.org>
This patch provides an arch hook in the PC speaker beeper driver which
gives the arch code an opportunity to determine whether the machine
has an i8253 timer or not.  If it doesn't we don't want the driver to
go poking at the i8253's ports; there might be nothing there or there
might be something else there which would be upset by being poked at.
We want to be able to build ppc64 kernels which work both on machines
that have an i8253 equivalent (e.g. some pSeries) and on machines that
don't (e.g. G5 powermacs), which is why we don't just remove it from
the config.

Could this go in please, preferably for 2.6.15?  Some people are
finding that their G5 powermacs lock up when this driver pokes the PIT
registers.
