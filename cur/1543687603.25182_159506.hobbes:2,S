What's up with linux-2.2 now? Who will do Alan's job in the next year?
Marc is intrested doing this job. I know Marc from linux-2.2.x-secure
and from the wolk project, see 
http://wolk.sourceforge.net
. Why not
Marc? He can surely differentiate between mainstream and a private kernel fork
tree. Or do you think, Marc will merge every single bit out of his kernel tree
into mainstream? I bet he won't 
I can't see postings from other people who want to take 2.2.
I think 2.2 is not dead. I often see 2.2 kernels running on systems like
wlan access points or dsl routers from different vendors. 2.2 is often
used where stability is a must-have. At least security fixes have to go in.
What do you think?
