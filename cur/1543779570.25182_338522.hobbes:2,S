OK, I rolled my own patch, 2.6.13-rc4-ck1-reiser4+this patch and it
appears to be running on my desktop Asus A7N8X very well:
I am running with Local APIC/IO-APIC/APIC Timer and forceapic. Time
does not appear to be running slow, and I do not appear to have a slow
boot.
sbh@rocket ~ $ cat /sys/devices/system/timer/timer0/dyn_tick_state
suitable:       1
enabled:        1
using APIC:     1
[4294683.959000] dyn-tick: Maximum ticks to skip limited to 803
[4294683.959000] dyn-tick: Timer using dynamic tick
The nvidia driver also works, and the most unexpected thing is after a
few hours of running it seems stable :)
So, to repeat I'm only reporting sucess, I'm unsure of the power
savings but this computer is on all day.
Thanks,
avuton
