If run_workqueue() takes a lock_cpu_hotplug() successfully, then we shouldnt 
even reach till this point, as it will block writers (cpu_down/up) until it
completes.
	run_workqueue()
	---------------
	
try_again:
	rc = lock_cpu_hotplug_interruptible();
	
	if (rc && kthread_should_stop())
		return;
	
	if (rc != 0)
		goto try_again;
	
	/* cpu_down/up shouldnt happen now untill we call unlock_cpu_hotplug */
	while (!list_empty(..))
		work->func();
	
	unlock_cpu_hotplug();
If work->func() calls something (say flush_workqueue()) which requires a
lock_cpu_hotplug() again, there are two ways to support it:
Method 1: Add a field, hotplug_lock_held, in task_struct
	If current->hotplug_lock_held > 1, then lock_cpu_hotplug()
	merely increments it and returns success. Its counterpart, 
	unlock_cpu_hotplug() will decrement the count.
	Easiest to implement. However additional field is required in
	each task_struct, which may not be attractive for some.
Method 2 : Bias readers over writers:
	This method will support recursive calls to lock_cpu_hotplug()
	by the same thread, w/o requiring a field in task_struct. To 
	accomplish this, readers are biased over writers i.e 
		reader1_lock(); <- success
					writer1_lock(); <- blocks on reader1
		reader2_lock(); <- success
A fair lock would have blocked reader2_lock() until 
writer1_lock()/writer1_unlock() is complete, but since we are required to 
support recursion w/o maintaining a task_struct field, we let reader2_lock() 
succeed, even though it could be from a different thread.

freezer wont give stable access to cpu_online_map either, as could typically be
required in functions like flush_workqueue.
