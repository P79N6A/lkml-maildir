Hello Alan,

I meant instrumented fast_copy_page() cannot fail due to
late movntq commit to memory since memcmp() is behind sfence
and kernel_fpu_end():

If we still see an oops with this instrumentation,
then fast_copy_page() must be clobbering
RAM elsewhere, right?

Yes, but sometimes we have routines which perform
differently on different CPUs. See inslude/asm-i386/string.h
and string-486.h: on Pentium rep movsd is faster, on 386 unrolled
loop is faster... so optimal routine can be picked only at runtime.
CPU-specific routines can compete in such runtime benchmark
too when proper processor is detected - see how KNI-specific
RAID xor routine does that.
