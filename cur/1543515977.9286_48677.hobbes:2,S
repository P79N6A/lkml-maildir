Only one bunch of people have ever moved Linux to a non gcc compiler. 
Irrespective of stuff like makefiles its _very_ hard. I know, Im the nutter
who started Linux 8086, thankfully Alistair Riddoch took it over and is
even crazier.
Linux requires inline assembler, and compiler ways of specifying alignment
rules on a per struct field basis. It makes use of a whole pile of preprocessor
and other stuff that quite frankly is simply essential and not portable 
across compilers.

They won't make much difference if any. All the kernel hot spots are hand
tuned. We in places tune the C to get the code we want out of gcc - things
like branch order
