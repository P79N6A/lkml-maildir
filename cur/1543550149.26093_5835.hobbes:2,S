Exactly what I said...

Nope. C++ (the language) was rather stable in '96 or so, but by then it was
too late for Linux.

I'd suspect the projects that floundered did so because of this. C++ is a
wonderful tool, but I can't claim to know even one person that _really_
knows how to use it right. Most "OO" development is simply C + << + >> + a
few structs sold as classes (remember "FORTRAN with ';'" when Pascal came
out?), it will still take quite a while until people are confortable with
OO (even worse multiparadigm programming (MP? Nice buzzword ;-) as in C++
for that matter), and until then the language's facilities are a burden by
and large.
