you've already been given a pointer to the                               
Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt document in the kernel sources 
that explains these issues.

It's not wrong.
Every vendor of any kind of software will tell you A is supported and 
B is not supported.
It's a consensus among the Linux kernel developers that the Linux kernel 
does not support a stable API for external modules.
You don't have to like this decision, but stable_api_nonsense.txt 
explains it.
If you dislike this decision, there are several other operating systems 
whose vendors do offer a stable API for external modules.

The 2.6 is a stable kernel series in the sense that it doesn't crash 
very often.
2.6.14 is not API-compatible with 2.6.15.
But this has always been this way, the new development model only brings 
more API changes than the previous development models.

I do agree, this is not a task for the user.
It's a task for the vendors of the external modules.
