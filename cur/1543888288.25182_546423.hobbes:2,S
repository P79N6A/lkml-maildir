I merged the first three patches into -mm, thanks.
All the system call numbers got changed due to recent additions.  They
may change in the future, too - nothing is stable until the code lands
in mainline.
I didn't merge any of the ext4 changes as they appear to be in Ted's
devel tree.  Although I didn't check that they are 100% the same in 
that tree.
What's the plan to get some ext4 updates into mainline, btw?  Things
seem to be rather gradual.
