You turn it off once, and your distro keeps it that way. Doesn't seem
that onerous to me. 
The key difference is that that poor user who's setting the thing up 
for the first time has more of a clue what's going on. Making Linux
less hostile to new users is a Good Thing (tm).

And all for the fact that when the user sets up the system, it just
works. With sensible defaults. Instead of being an elitist piece of
crap that only l33t g33ks can use.
Even for people that are capable of debugging it, it's just not a
productive use of time. I have better things to do with my life that debug
non-inuitive user interfaces, thanks.

It's about making it easy to use. The expert users can configure the
damned thing any way they please anyway. For novices, it should do
something intuitive out of the box. The same principle should apply
to reams of crappy software out there right now.

Indeed. Initial impression of people upgrading a kernel from 2.4 to 2.5/6
is that "sound doesn't work in 2.5/6". Not good.
