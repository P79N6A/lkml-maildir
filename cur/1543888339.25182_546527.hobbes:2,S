Subject: [PATCH] Add ip6_tunnel.h to headers_install
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/19/132

The Mobile IPv6 package (
http://www.mobile-ipv6.org/software/
) needs
this header file to build the tunnelctl component. The header
already looks sanitized so is safe to export.
