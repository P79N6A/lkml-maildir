That's not huge (supposing you have something like 128mbyte of phys ram). 
But as just said even if if such memory would be huge, if it's really used
as cache for the data, the shm has to be set as SHM_LOCKED (not swappable
out) so the shm swapout code (even if superoptimized) would have no way to
touch it.
