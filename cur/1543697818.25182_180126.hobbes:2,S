Yes that only stops balancing across physical packages when there are
none. But there might be a performance improvement for light (cache
footprint wise) high frequency interrupt handling which stays affined to
one logical processor.

This is all i386 specific code so we don't have to care about other
architectures in here.

smp_num_siblings won't be greater than 2 with current i386 processors,
it's not a total sibling count, but a per physical package count.
