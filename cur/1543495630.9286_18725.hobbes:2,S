My systems locks up with the message
stuck on TLB IPI wait (CPU#0)
after about an hour or 2 when runngin kernel 2.2.7 .. I have the same
problem with other 2.2.x kernels and 2.1.132 seems to lock up too, but a lot
less frequent (2.2.x can't run longer than a day, 2.1.132 can hold out as
long as a couple of days).
It seems to depend on the network load.. The heavier I transfer files over
the network, the quicker the system locks up.
