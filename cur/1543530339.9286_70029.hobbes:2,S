If your device is doing it's own DMA, basically you are telling it to
write its stuff to some physical address that you give it. If this
is correct, then your driver needs to lock user pages in place if
you are not going to use kernel memory.
The easiest way I can see is to reference a physical page from
user space. Since this page doesn't go away (it's physical), your device
wouldn't have any problem writing to it.
For instance, this program maps physical address c0000 from user-space
and reads from it. If your boards were writing to this area, you would
see what they had written.
You can write too. In other words, this is exactly what you would
do under DOS DEBUG if you were referencing C000:0000. That said, if
you expect to be able to tell your board to write to a DOS program's
buffer at 2000:1234, (remember this is physical memory), you
need to do exactly the same thing from 32-bit world except that
you don't use the segment/offset. So you would mmap 201234 or any
other physical address you could find.
You do not allocate memory from user-space then find its physical
address because, even if locked, the kernel is free to change its
physical location (can happen if you add new pages). Also note
that the physical/logical translation is per page. What looks
like a continuous xMb buffer in user-space could certainly be
a bunch of 0x1000 - byte pages scattered all around physical memory,
even if locked into place.
