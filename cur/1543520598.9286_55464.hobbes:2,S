2.3.33 clean kernel running SMP on SMP (dual-celeron, tyan tiger 100,
440BX, OC300->500(bus 100), rock-solid stable till today, 9GB IBM 7200rpm 
3 months old HD in home usage)
all possible optimizations switched on in kernel config.
doing as non-root:
deleting about 800MB of files - unpacked sources, large files, small
files, about 21000 files.
2.3.34 unpacked, 2.3.35-pre6 patch applied.
make menuconfig ;ati mach 64 as module
make dep; make -j3 bzImage;
ends up with missing subject file
subject file kindof is and isnt there...
autocompletion in bash shows it, ls gives error.
reboot single mode
e2fsck -f /dev/hda5
	aty.h entry in ...config/fb has unused inode... clear yes
e2fsck -b /dev/hda5
	doesnt scream, but tells filesystem modified
badblocks -vv /dev/hda5 2478138
	doesnt scream (I hope it should)
e2fsck -b /dev/hda5
	doesnt scream, but tells filesystem modified
the file(aty.h) is lost
1. HDD is quite new, 7200 rpm IBM 9GB : IBM-DJNA-370910
about 3 months old.
2. couldnt repeat the error
3. there is some possibility that it is a ext2 bug ?
if you really insist, I can do a badblocks write test.
elmer.
