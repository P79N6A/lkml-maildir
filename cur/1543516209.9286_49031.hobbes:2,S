Here's a question about the sigwaitinfo-based IO mechanisim.  
I've got a mutli-threaded app where one thread handles accept()ing new
connections and then distributes those connections to a pool of
workers.  The accept() thread sets up async io on the socket and
assigns that socket to one of the woker threads via F_SETOWN
When I execute the program, I see SIGIO being delivered to the worker
thread, rather than the RT signal that I requested.
Is this a bug with my code, the kernel, or is it a just a feature
that I didn't expect?
[Accept thread]
	fcntl (newsock, F_SETOWN, SOME_WORKER_PID);  // Assign the new 
			          		     // connetion to a worker.
	fcntl (newsock, F_SETSIG, SOME_RT_SIG);
	fcntl (newsock, F_SETFL, fcntl(F_GETFL) | O_NONBLOCK | O_ASYNC);
[Worker thread]
	sigblock (SOME_RT_SIG); 
	while (1)
	{
		sigwaitinf ()
		.
		.
		.
		// do interesting things
	}
