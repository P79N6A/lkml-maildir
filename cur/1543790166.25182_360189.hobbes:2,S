Ok, just a little update as it might be interesting for others, too: yesterday 
a friend came surprisingly to my place because his server didn't work 
properly (we worked till 4am...) and he brought a windows laptop! So I 
searched a bit more and found a new firmware for the PL3507, dated September 
2005, and flashed it.
But, alas, to no avail. The problem persists, when writing to the HD I get the 
above error and the hd/kernel hangs for some time until it resumes. So my 
guess is, this might really be a bug in our kernel and not the firmware?
And I haven't even mentioned yet that I have a DVD writer in an icybox as 
well, I flashed this one too but still can't even *read* from any CD/DVD. 
There the kernel hangs itself for a while and prints

Oh well. For now I most definitely have to look for the USB alternative.
