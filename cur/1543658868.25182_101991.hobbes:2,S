There's still a boatload of drivers that don't compile,
a metric shitload of bits that never came over from 2.4 after
I stopped doing it circa 2.4.18, a lot of little 'trivial'
patches that got left by the wayside, and a load of 'strange' bits
that still need nailing down (personally, I have two boxes
that won't boot a 2.5 kernel currently (One was pnpbios related,
other needs more investigation), and another that falls on its
face after 10 minutes idle uptime. My p4-ht desktop box is the only one
that runs 2.5 without any problems.
I think we're a way off from a '2.6-test' phase personally,
but instigating a harder 'code freeze' would probably be a
good thing to do[1]
