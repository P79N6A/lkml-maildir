Huh.I can be wrong but why, oh WHY everyone is trying to add low limits in
design just to try to break then later ? 32, 64 or 128 WILL NOT be enough in
long run. I can understood why capabilities in kernel are 32bit word:
  1. they are checked quite often and so it should be doable FAST and
  2. they can be extended in future without big fuzz (it's internal kernel
structures so only few system calls should be changed)
On other hand once something added to filesystem, it's added to FILESYSTEM.
Read "set in stone". It's VERY hard to fix something there. And starting of
program is NOT time-critical operation. Even if you put capabilities in
separate file and store inode number of that file in inode of capability-enabled
file this will not slow process starting much (even if IMO it's overkill).
So 32bit is not way to go and even 64 is not enough. IMHO anyway.
