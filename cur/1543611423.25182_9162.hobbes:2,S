kapm_idled will get scheduling time when there is nothing else to run, 
whether it wants it or is using it is more of the question.

Stick some printk calls in so you can see a count of when the thread runs
and also see when it decides to ask the BIOS to do idling (and also what
then occurs).
I fixed one case recently where we would spin calling the bios all the time
when instead of pausing the bios replied that it had slowed down the
processor. That however was post 2.4.9 so I dont think its related.
