Well you currently don't have such a patch so thats a disingenuous
argument. More useful for the short term till this is fixed might be to
provide
	pci_requires_mmconfig(dev)
which forces it on for that device regardless and may (internal
implementation detail) print a warning "if your system hangs at this
point.." type message.
That gets us the best of both worlds.
