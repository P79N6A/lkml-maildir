It isn't bad at all. My GeForce I DDR typically exceeds 300 FPS, and
approaches 400 FPS, on 32 bit, 640x480. It goes down at higher
resolution of course, but it is insanely fast compared to tech from just
a short time ago in history. People are reading old information and hear
about the theoretical problems of X11, without realizing direct
rendering works just fine on X11 (it's just a matter of writing the
software to do it, the effort started at a later date than with Win, and
is sometimes crippled by manufacturers hiding information). Even on Win,
bad drivers cause very bad performance. I'd love to see the day that Win
can crash its graphics interface and survive without bringing the
machine down.
