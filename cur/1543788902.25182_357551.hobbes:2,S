You do realize that it's a BS, don't you?
* attacker that would rewrite kernel code can switch a pointer to method in
any of the method tables (or pointer to the entire method table, while we are
at it).
* overwriting return address is trivial if you got stack smashing and there
is a plenty of interesting functions in the kernel ready to elevate priveleges
* modules rely on practically complete access to kernel data structures, so
no amount of playing with rings will change anything for them.
