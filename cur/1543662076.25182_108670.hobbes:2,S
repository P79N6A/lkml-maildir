Obviously, No.
Unfortunatly kernel do not use segments (fully). So even you have HIMEM at the kernel it's not possible to user program to address more than 4 gb a ram at the same time. And as far as i know program can not have more than 1 gm of usable readwrite memory.
THe only way for u is to use 64 bit architecture... or remap default address range splitting increase address range for pgrogram data (it's require to recompile all programs).
