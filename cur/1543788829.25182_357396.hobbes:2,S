Hi, Steve:
    Thanks for so detailed explain.
    It seem I am not understand what is sleep and wakeup truly.
    What's your mean of "in runqueue"? I think you mean the
task_struct is in one priority array (active or expired)
of one queue. the schedule() only can process task in runqueue.
In deactivate_task(), it will reset task_struct->array to NULL,
After call it, we can not wake up that task.
    However, I read try_to_wake_up(), and found it can handle that case
which task_struct->array is NULL, it will be call activate_task()
to insert task to one runqueue. and default_wake_function() will
call try_to_wake_up(), so we still can wake up it.
    I am confused again. this quesion is more interesting and more.
    Wait for reply.
    Good luck.
