If you create .config from scratch, then you can get away without
reading help texts if you have a target with minimal hardware and
protocols requirements and you know all the subsystems involved.
In all other cases, you theoretically need to read all help texts (minus
the ones that don't appear because you deselect entire subsystems).  In
practice, this takes too much time, hence you take an existing .config
(yours or somebody else's) and go from there.
Whenever one enables an option for the first time, it would IMO be
foolish to ignore its help text.
