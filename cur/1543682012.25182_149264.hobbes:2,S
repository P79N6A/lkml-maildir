	Hello,
	In these days I've bought a Tyan i7505 board with a single Xeon
processor. I noticed its GART would only be supported in 2.5.53. So I
compiled 2.5.75 and everything was okay. (Hyperthreading on)
	I have five SCSI HDDs in an Adaptec AHA-2940UW card in RAID5 (software,
obviously), one as a spare disk. /dev/md0 had an ext3 partition. The
graphics card is a Radeon 9000 Pro (64M). X 4.3.0. 1024M system memory.
No devfs compiled. EtherExpress Pro/100 onboard card.
	Rebooting the system with the new 2.6.0-test1 kernel was okay after
replacing 2.5.75. After starting X, I noticed the CPU usage was at 100%.
I switched to a terminal and logged. ls itself gave me ext3 errors and
when I switched back to 2.5.75 the array was entirely damaged (could not
repair at all, so I do not have .config to report)
	Would it be something introduced in the sync_fs() fix or something?
	I can give further reports, if needed, installing a distribution in a
separate hard disk.
