Nope. You can run multiple threads "simultaneously" on an uniprocessor,
so simultaneous as the rest of the processes the cpu is running.
Of course the efficiency of multi-threading drops on an uni-processor
if your threads only do hard math work and no IO, but a thread can
be crunchin numbers at the same time one other is waiting for IO even
on a one cpu box. Think on an app that does read-process-write in loop.
Two parallel threads on an uniprocessor can overlap IO and process
and be more efficient than a non-threaded version.
