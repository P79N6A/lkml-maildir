If you're saying that drawing an analagy between the kernel's concept 
of the current task pointer and thread APIs is invalid, I'm rather 
surprised.  Ulrich, comments like this are unnecessarily inflammatory 
and don't lead to a productive discussion of the merits and failings 
of specific points.

My position is that requiring a thread register for unthreaded applications 
is unnecessary bloat.  Since the thread register is yet another register 
that must be saved and reloaded on context switch, while it provides no 
improvements in performance or functionality for single threaded programs, 
it is pure bloat.  Every single change like this that slows down unthreads 
apps goes directly onto the boot and startup time of your system and 
various applications.  Think about it!

I'm trying to help reach a point of consensus where you are failing to 
see Andi's point: using the TLS segment everywhere slows everything down 
a tiny bit.  Don't do it for unthreaded programs.  We're trying to avoid 
pessimizations while we still can for a new architecture.  I fail to see 
why you are not listening to this.  Yes, threaded apps exist, but their 
existance does not preclude the slowing down of unthreaded apps.
