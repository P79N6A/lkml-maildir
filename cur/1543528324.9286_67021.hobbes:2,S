sct's stance on race conditions between close(), accept(), and sigwaitinfo()
in sigio-based programs can be summed up as "Oh, don't worry about 
ghost events, you should be prepared for read() to return EWOULDBLOCK".
This works for POLL_IN and POLL_OUT events.  But Julian points out that
it might be hard to ignore POLL_ERR and POLL_HUP events in the same way.
Maybe we do need marker events for fd creation and/or deletion after all...
sct, what say ye?
