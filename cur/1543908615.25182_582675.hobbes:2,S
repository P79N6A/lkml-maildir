You suspected correctly - Apple Mail line wrapped it at 72 columns
(added newlines in any line going past column 72.)  This makes it
impossible to apply the patch without alot of hand editing.
As you probably also suspect (correctly, again), given the volume of
patches we handle on lkml, the burden is on the submitter to get the
patch format correct, so it applies cleanly.
You will have to experiment some, sending the patch to yourself and
being sure that it applies cleanly.  I'm not an Apple Mail expert, so
can't help; sorry.  Perhaps some other email program ...?
For example, this line wrapped:
fs/open.c                 |   63 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 
+++++++++
and more critically, in the patch, many lines, such as:
+/* file descriptors required to complete current I/O operation  
successfully */
+	struct list_head required_fds;
