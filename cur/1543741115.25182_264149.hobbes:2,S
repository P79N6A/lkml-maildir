Thats completely stupid
CONFIG_AGP enables the building of AGP modules, it does not disable the
ability to run that kernel on non AGP setups, or to use non AGP video
cards.
The relationship is dynamic and you'd need to fix the various drivers
that support both PCI and AGP mode by compiling them twice so you can
load them with or without agp support.
Yuck yuck yuck. It would instead be much saner to fix the module loader
to support weak symbols.
