Its caught errors before that probably avoided people losing data. Its a good
sanity check. The "stupid" defaults are two other things
	o	Using 1K blocks on large disks (4K is way faster) and
		4K checks way faster too
	o	Not using the "sparse superblock" option on large disks
		when creating them.
Unfortunately I dont think there are any "in place" fixers for those creation
time choices
