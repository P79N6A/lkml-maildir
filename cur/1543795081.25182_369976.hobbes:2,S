Before everyone gets excited, I realize that all of this has
historical implications. But that doesn't mean we can't discuss
possible future alternative solutions.
Thinking about this for a while it seems to me that the problem is
that the various apps (init, syslog) etc should not have a tty name as
part of their command line parameters. Instead these apps could use
ptys instead. Ptys would solve all of the race problems too.
Is there any good reason (other than history) for using a device node
name (tty0, etc) instead of some other naming scheme if names are
needed at all?
If init, syslog, etc can be converted to ptys, do we need ttys? Xterms
use ptys I don't notice that they aren't connect to a fix tty name.
The virtual consoles would still be 0,1,2 but do they have to be
hooked to tty0, 1, 2 instead of a pty?
