Uh, what does your /etc/ntp/drift file show?
The basic equation is: 
btime ~= gettimeodfay() - uptime
Thus if your time of day is adjusted by NTP, btime will change as well.
Uptime is calculated calculated by jiffies/HZ, and HZ is not NTP
adjusted, so if your system is running 180ppm too fast or slow, btime
would be expected to change. 
I'm not yet sure how that is related to the ps start time being wrong.
