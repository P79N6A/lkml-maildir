I have one. It's in my head. It's called the Linux Kernel C standard. Some 
of it is documented in CodinggStyle, others is just codified in existing 
practice.

That's some totally irrelevant standard that only acts as a rough 
guideline. It dosn't know about inline assembly, and it doesn't know about 
coding standards, and it allows the most atrocious code. There's even a 
contest in making such code - it's called the Obfuscated C Contest, and it 
actually encourages using strict ANSI rules.
Me, I don't accept the kind of entries the OCC accepts.
