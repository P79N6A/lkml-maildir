It would seem that a number of us are testing the variants and reporting 
results (I now have to pull all the new versions and redo stuff, but I 
have a new test I'm going to run as well).
Given that and the fact that there is another idea which can be tested 
from Tong Li, I think that decision can be postponed, Linus willing. 
There appear to be enough testers to be driving evolution now, authors 
may disagree, of course.
