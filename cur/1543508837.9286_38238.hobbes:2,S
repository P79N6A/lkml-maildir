Hi Alan,
When i fill my receive ring i allocate a SKB which is able to hold the max
size ethernet packet....
So you're suggesting that for small packets i'll allocate a new SKB an copy
the packet data to this new skb and
pass this new skb to netif_rx?
What do you consider as small?
And what do you think about my driver-specific bh routine idiea?
Btw, i have a strange problems... when i'm doing ping from my ucLinux device
if i use ping packet size < 128 bytes
i'm getting enormouss RTT spread. the RTT varies of 0.4 ms to 4000 ms. My
protocol analyzer shows that
the ICMP echo packet comes back usially in 0.4 ms.... so it seems that the
small packets are stuck somewhere
between my driver and ping application for variable amount of time....
With packets >128 bytes there is NO problem....
the kernel is 2.0.33 based...
Any ideas?
Regards
Vadim
