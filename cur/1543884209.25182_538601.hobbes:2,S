Not lining up with the code following the if statement is also
a plus.  Because it clearly delineates the conditions from the code.
Of course in many cases conditions this complex are candidates for
if (!condition1)
	continue;
if (!condition2)
	continue;
if (!condition3a && !condition3b)
	continue;
