Yes, this is the same new tool that is required for plain 2.4.21 and -ac
and for the last patch as well (not yet applied by you, BTW it's
http://hq.pm.waw.pl/pub/linux/hdlc/hdlc-2.4.21pre5-ac3-1.14.patch
or ftp:// the same, production-tested = you can apply it safely).
2.4.20 used older sethdlc tool but in practice all users were already
using the newer tool + kernel patch.
The last patch (1.14) contains few small bug-fixes and new Ethernet framing
for HDLC and FR. There are no incompatible ABI changes (i.e. older
sethdlc binary works with new kernels, but you of course need new tool for
new features) after the "big" switch in 2.4.21pre.
