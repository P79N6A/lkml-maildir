Can you tell me how to get any recent kernel to compile on Alpha?  I run 
Red Hat 7.2/Alpha on my UP2000 and can't get anything newer than a 
2.4.9-32.7 to compile/run on it. Even the 2.4.18-27.7.x.hp supplied by 
HP panics on boot. I filed some bugs on bugzilla.kernel.org against 
2.6.0-test4-bk8 and they just sit there in NEW state. #1196 and 1197 
IIRC if you are interested. Thanks.
