Hi Yinghai,
thanks for reply BUT that is not the point (or maybe I miss something).
Look, we only have head64.c - there is no head32.c at all. Both
vmlinux_32/64.lds defines _end exactly the same as __bss_stop. So in
code which DO fillup bss section with zeros the prefered name is
__bss_stop. The only thing I'm trying to say that it would be clean
naming scheme and I think it would help for further review - instead
of searching all over x86 files to find _end definition __bss_stop
tell us WHAT we are zeroing from the code.
