This seems fine.

That's a policy decision for the maker of the Unicode map.  The kernel 
cannot by default know that a pre-composed ű is a modified u; obviously, 
if the ű is send in decomposed form the kernel probably will display it 
as u? or some such.

As far as width handling -- in order to make all the text line up under 
all circumstances you need more than width handling.  The wcwidth() 
stuff is specific to CJK -- a character set which is totally implausible 
to display on the builtin console.  You also need bidir support (in case 
you encounter Hebrew or Arabic), you need Indic shape handling (Indic 
langauges have some *very* odd composing rules), etc, and this is just 
to know how much space to take up on the screen.
is is ridiculous.  It's much better to draw a line in the sand and say 
that this is beyond the scope of the in-kernel Linux console.
