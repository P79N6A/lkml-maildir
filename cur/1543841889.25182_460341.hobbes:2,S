Could you test your application with 2.6.18-rc6 and this change
	-       if (task == current)
	+       if (task->tgid == current->tgid)
reverted? I think any report, positive or negative, would be useful.
It would be nice if your test covers different conditions, such as
'main thread debugs sub-thread' and vice versa. Exec under ptrace is
also interesting.
