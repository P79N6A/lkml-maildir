Ok, I've found a way to reproduce it without loading any prop. stuff.
1. boot with init=/bin/sh
2. run hdparm -S 1 /dev/sda
3. run hddtemp /dev/sda
4. immediate oops
another hang:
1. boot with init=/bin/sh
2. run hdparm -y /dev/sda
Nevertheless, as promised I rand without hddtemp for about a day. I got
this single error:
ata2: translated ATA stat/err 0x25/00 to SCSI SK/ASC/ASCQ 0x4/00/00
ata2: status=0x25 { DeviceFault CorrectedError Error }
SCSI error : <1 0 0 0> return code = 0x8000002
sda: Current: sense key: Hardware Error
    Additional sense: No additional sense information
end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 240910336
I will reverse apply the patch and proceed w/o hddtemp/hdparm... lets
see whether it survives this night.
