I know that PCI uses a 32-bit number (or two 16-bit numbers if one
prefers to think of it that way) to identify each piece of equipment.
Is there a similar number for USB, Firewire, etc?
If so, the hotplug firmware driver could use those numbers prefixed
by a code for the relevant bus to identify the relevant firmware.
For example...
	P:1234:5678		PCI Bus code 1234:5678
	U:1234:5678		USB Bus code 1234:5678
...and the hotplug driver would know whether those two were the same
device on different buses, or two different devices.
Best wishes from Riley.
