I think you are right on this. I've setup 
http://www.ds9a.nl/2.4Routing/
where you can already find .txt and .html of my limited efforts so far.

It'd be hard, and it would also duplicate lots of existing efforts. Perhaps
it is feasible if it is a cooperative work, where many people contribute, via
cvs for example? 
Currently, I'm aiming at a (mostly) iproute2 HOWTO, with some netfiltering
thrown in. The intended audience is people who grok normal Linux routing
configuration and want to move on.
