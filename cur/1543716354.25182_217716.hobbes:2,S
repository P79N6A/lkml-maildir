Jeff noticed something else that was missing from the 2.4 -> 2.6 
conversion (see below).
To all,
Looking at the code in fs/autofs4/waitq.c again, due to Jeff Moyers' 
comments, I really think I've got the locking wrong.
Can someone review this considering the case where two process do an ls of 
the same directory, that is a potential autofs4 mount (ie. an empty 
directory not yet a mountpoint), at the same time.
