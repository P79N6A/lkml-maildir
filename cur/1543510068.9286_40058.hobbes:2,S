Just a thought - all the discussion so far has assume that there are
only two options: running the mod/demod in user space, or compiling it
as a traditional kernel module, distributed with the kernel tree.
A third possibility, although not necessarily a good one, exists -
you could make a simple enough interface to the DSP code from the
rest of the driver that it wouldn't change between kernel versions (&
especially wouldn't need spinlocks, etc. for SMP because it would be
single-threaded).  This would have the advantage of allowing the DSP
modules to be distributed and compiled as part of a user-space package,
as they would work across all kernel versions with the same rev of the
softmodem driver.
