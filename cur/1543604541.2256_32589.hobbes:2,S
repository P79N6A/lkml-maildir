I can add to this that 2.4.2 works fine, I've tried 2.4.9 and 2.4.11
and I can't use the lan either. 
In 2.4.11, I can see that the driver can sense if I plug/unplug the
connector (10BaseT, connected to a Compaq Netelligent 8 port hub), but
nothing more.
here's what 2.4.2 says about the card:
# lspci -v -v -s 00:03.0
00:03.0 Ethernet controller: Digital Equipment Corporation DECchip 21041 [Tulip Pass 3] (rev 11)
        Control: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- Stepping- SERR+ FastB2B-
        Status: Cap- 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B+ ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
        Latency: 96
        Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 15
        Region 0: I/O ports at fc00 [size=128]
        Region 1: Memory at df000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=128]
        Expansion ROM at de000000 [disabled] [size=256K]
I am now trying to compile again 2.4.11 with the driver as module,
instead of built-in, just to see if I can pass some parameters to
force a media type without rebooting every time.
Please suggest any other test I can make, or if you need more informations.
