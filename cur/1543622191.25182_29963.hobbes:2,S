Hi All,
	I've been working on hotplug with the new scheduler and preempt.
It still crashes, so no public code yet 8).  It follows Linus's suggestion
that cpu_up() be called during the boot process, which is nicer.
	But this particular problem did not hurt me, since I now run a 
"suicide" thread on the dying CPU, making it safe and trivial to manually
re-queue processes.  The question of what to do with processes which cannot
be scheduled on any remaining CPUs is another interesting question.
(Note: downing a CPU with a suicide thread introduces cleanup issues: I may
yet return to the original implementations where suicide thread == idle thread).
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
