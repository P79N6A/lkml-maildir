One of the simplifying things I do between OS's is turn of the MMU, or
at least give it a 1-1 trivial mapping with physical memory.
If all of that memory is hanging out there forever. It probably makes sense
to be high memory capable.  But for the first rev of this I won't be.
Addresses > 4GB are a major pain to work with on x86.  
But I do have a test machine that can reproduce that so I can test for
strange bugs.  I added a BIOS option to put all but 512M out of 4GB
above the 4GB line.
