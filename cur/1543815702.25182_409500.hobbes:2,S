Yes, that's the same logic I applied. I think it is redundant, but I 
think it makes sense to add a sentence to the effect that the file is 
GPL if you want it to be, just to avoid any fears or complaints, and to 
show that we really aren't trying to do anything fishy. And IANAL so 
I'll err on the side of caution and redundancy. :-)
