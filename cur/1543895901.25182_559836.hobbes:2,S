Sure, I knew that, I was trying to push the boundaries a bit here with
magic version filenaming conventions to show that it won't scale.
Heck, trying to figure out what:
	touch foo::::::::::::::::::::::
does would be interesting, and would the filesystem parsing code
handle that case?

I agree 100%, it's a much better solution, though it has it's own
problems, esp over NFS and getting back to your original parent
directory properly can be painful.
