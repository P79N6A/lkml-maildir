Well, the first thing that seems obvious is that you're using
different version of userspace, and the newer userspace is on the
system that behaves better.
The second thing that pops to mind: are you doing all these
measurements booted into single user mode (init=/bin/bash or
somesuch)? If not, then I don't think we can pin this on the hardware
quite yet.
