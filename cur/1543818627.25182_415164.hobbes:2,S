And so our dirty laundry is out... :)
We have a sad history here - back a few parts, we had less descriptors to 
describe IO, so we opted to combine several components under the same PCI
header to save resources.  So the bottom line is that we have at least three
desirable devices (timers, GPIO pins and the SMBus) that all lay claim to
the same device.  So a proper PCI header would be difficult to implement - 
either we would have 1 device that registered with three different
subsystems, or we would have three individual devices, the first of which
would get the PCI resources to the ruin of the others.
So this is the solution I came up with, for older parts.  For newer parts,
I sat the BIOS guys down in a room with a guy name Bruno, and they agreed
to make a separate header for each component.
So thats the back story, and I think that Ben will agree, since he also wrote
the GPIO driver which suffers from the same problem.

Oops - right on both points.

Ok -  that makes sense.

I struggled with this.  By pure luck, the SMBus I/O address is available
on BAR 0 for both parts, but I left it open in case a BIOS vendor wanted
to do something different.  My fault probably for trying to design for
something that doesn't exist.

Yep, that would probably be better.

Argh - I can't believe I let that slip through.

6 one, half a dozen the other.  Its probably more likely that this code
will be run on a CS5535 or CS5536.
I'll go ahead and work up some changes when I get back in the office next
week.  Like I said in my original e-mail, this isn't as urgent a change
as the other one, so we can probably wait until 2.6.18.
