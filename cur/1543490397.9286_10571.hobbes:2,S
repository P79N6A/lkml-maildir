Okay, now I'm curious: can someone give me a further pointers about this?
Details:
I just got a new motherboard (Asus P2B-DS), it reports various voltages,
fan speeds, and mboard temperature in the ("hit <del> at") boot-time
BIOS (APM) setup page, so I know it can measure them.
How does one access these values?
I've grepped the kernel source code for 'lm78' and 'fan'.  
I found only drivers/char/wdt.c --- I don't think it's what I want.
