These code paths shouldn't be mixed in the first place, i.e. if
you use stuff in setup-bus.c, don't use pci_read_bridge_bases.
Basically, these are two different approaches to PCI setup:
"We trust our firmware" (i386, ia64) and "We are the firmware"
(alpha, arm, partially parisc).

Right, as required by PCI-PCI bridge specs.

I think that "assuming transparent" code is not correct. Yes, PCI-PCI
bridge specs allow "transparent" (i.e. subtractive decoding) bridges,
but such bridges must have a class code 0x60401. IMO, we need something
like this instead:
 	if (!dev)		/* It's a host bus, nothing to read */
 		return;
 
+	if (dev->class & 1) {
+		printk("Subtractive decoding bridge %s: assuming transparent\n",
+					dev->name);
+		for(i=0; i<3; i++)
+			child->resource[i] = child->parent->resource[i];
+		return;
+	}
Of course, this requires testing on problematic machines.
BTW, currently almost every PC user sees those "Unknown bridge resource"
messages just because a graphic card behind the AGP bridge doesn't use
IO or prefetchable memory...
