I am successfully running the dynamic tick patch on an old IBM ThinkPad 
A22m.  When I enable the APIC support console beeps, you know bash -c 
'echo -e "\a"', takes a REALLY long time to finish.  I'm assuming this 
is a badly written program and not a kernel problem.  Correct?
BTW: how do you know what HZ your machine is running at?
