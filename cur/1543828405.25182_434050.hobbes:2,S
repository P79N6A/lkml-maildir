Hi Juampe, there were only two changes to the speedtouch driver
between 2.6.16 and 2.6.17: a cosmetic one (change to modinfo
output), and one only affecting people using iso urb support
(are you running with enable_isoc=1?).  So any new problems in
2.6.17 must be coming from elsewhere, such as ATM or USB changes.
I didn't spot any interesting ATM changes, and haven't looked at
the USB changes yet.  Are you sure you don't get the same problem
with 2.6.16?  Also, do you get any interesting messages in your
system logs (eg: check the dmesg output)?
Ciao,
Duncan.
