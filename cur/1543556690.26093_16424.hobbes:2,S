Maybe it is better to try with INT15 AX=2400 (Enable A20 gate). 
INT 15-2400 enable A20
INT 15-2401 disable A20
INT 15-2402 query status A20
INT 15-2403 query A20 support (kdb or port 92)
IBM classifies these functions as optional, but it is enabled on a lot
of
new BIOS, no know conflicts, thus we can call this function to enable
A20,
check the result and only after failure we can try the old methods.
