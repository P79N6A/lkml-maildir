They do some pretty evil stuff like..
+#ifdef STANDALONE_MODULE
 MODULE_LICENSE("GPL")
+#endif
Some of the folks at ATI really seem to be quite clued and 'get it'
(Like those responsible for sorting out the Radeon IGP GART driver).
On the other side of the coin the FireGL driver folks just get worse
every time. If they actually *tried* to communicate with the community
what they need from agpgart that its so obviously lacking, then there'd
be no need for any of this nonsense.
