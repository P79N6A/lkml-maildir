Hello,

Yes.
To me these numbers speak more than not really descriptive labels like
out_kfree out_kfree2 etc. I look at the code and see the flow. The most
important thing here is the order in which the resources are allocated and
if something goes wrong deallocated. Hence the numbers.
Anyway if that's a problem I can rewrite it.
