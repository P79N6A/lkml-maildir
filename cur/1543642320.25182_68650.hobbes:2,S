Hi,
I have successfully been using Legato Networker with a
blocksize of 32k with my DLT here.
But the way Legato wants to do it is to decide about the
blocksize itself.
This means that the driver should NOT decide on the BS, but
pass on anything written through it, meaning a blocksize setting
of 0 (or variable blocksize).
Perhaps Arkeia works the same way ?
Best Luck
