Start using more than one interface, then it begins to become
interesting.

CGI's can be cached btw if the implementation is clever (f.e. CGI
tells the web server that if the file used as input to the CGI does
not change then the output from the CGI will not change, meaning CGI
output is based solely on input, therefore CGI output can be cached
by the web server).

It helps no matter what part of the file the client reads.
sendfile() can be used on an arbitrary offset+len portion of
a file, it is not limited to just sending an entire fire.
