I think Joel simply made an error in his description.
__GFP_KERNRCLM corresponds to pages which are kernel-allocated, but have
some chance of being reclaimed at some point.  Basically, they're things
that will get freed back under memory pressure.  This can be direct, as
with the dcache and its slab shrinker, or more indirect as for control
structures like buffer_heads that get reclaimed after _other_ things are
freed.
