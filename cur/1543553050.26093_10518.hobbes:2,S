2.4 symbol generation code never sees the C++ names, 2.5 code might.
To detect a mismatch between kernel headers and the module version
file, I have to generate the checksum for the consumer of the symbol
(C++) as well as the generator of the symbol (C) and compare them.
There are issues involving partially defined structures which might
make this impossible to do, although I have some ideas on that front.
But if kernel code uses C names and module code uses C++ names there
will always be a spurious mismatch.  That would prevent symbol versions
from picking up some user errors.
