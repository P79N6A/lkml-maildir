Mike,
Could you try this patch to see if it solves the latency problem?
   tong
Changes:
1. Modified vruntime adjustment logic in set_task_cpu(). See comments in 
code. This fixed the negative vruntime problem.
2. This code in update_curr() seems to be wrong:
if (unlikely(!curr))
 	return sync_vruntime(cfs_rq);
cfs_rq->curr can be NULL even if cfs_rq->nr_running is non-zero (e.g., 
when an RT task is running). We only want to call sync_vruntime when 
cfs_rq->nr_running is 0. This fixed the large latency problem (at least in 
my tests).
