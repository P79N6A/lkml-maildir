Subject: [GIT PATCH] Driver Core patches for 2.6.17
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/21/347

Here are some driver core patches and fixes for 2.6.17.  They contain the
following changes:
	- documentation update
	- add ABI documentation as discussed on lkml
	- add ISA driver core framework
	- add ability for devices to work like class devices
	- let drivers get to tty class device pointer
	- add /sys/hypervisor when needed
	- some mutex conversions
	- some MODALIAS and uevent fixes
	- remove some unused exports
	- make the dev_printk() messags be a bit more informative when
	  we do not have a driver attached to a device yet.
All of these patches have been in the -mm tree for a number of months.
Please pull from:
	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
or if master.kernel.org hasn't synced up yet:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
Patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
greg k-h
