Thanks for the help!
I have posted my /proc/mtrr and /proc/meminfo to
http://www.layover.com/matt/kernel/
 .
The "lowmem" ones are when HIGHMEM was disabled, the "highmem" ones are
2.4.22 with CONF_HIGHMEM4G.  /proc/mtrr looks exatly the same whether or
not highmem is enabled.
I have the newest stable bios from Asus as of yesterday.
What should I see if the high memory isn't cachable?
