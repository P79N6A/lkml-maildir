Excuse me, 857,000,000 instructions executed and 460,000,000 context switches
a second -- on a PII system at 350 Mhz.  It's due to AGI optimization.  
Download MANOS and verify for yourself, it has a built in EMON in monitor.
After I complete the port, not even NetWare will be able to touch it.
Your Tux web server will also run on it, at significantly increased 
performance.
