I'm running Debian stable, Debian stable/testing (mix) and Debian 
unstable
with both customized 2.4 and 2.6 as well as stock 2.4 and 2.6 kernels
without any sign of problems. Of course lm-sensors on top of a stock 2.4
kernel will not fly but everything else works quite fine.
I might also add that I can test quite a few combinations because many
of my machines are netbooting and thus picking up a different version
is a easy as relinking a directory and this always needs a selfcompiled
kernel because of the nfsroot and ip autoconfiguration settings. The
downside is that I needed to make slight modifications to the systems
to have partly separated temp dirs without the need for one complete
installation per machine.
Servus,
