_Please_, if we do anything of that kind - let's use a new syscall.
Ideally, I'd say
	fs_fd = open("/fs/ext2", O_RDWR);
	/* error -> no such filesystem */
	write(fs_fd. "/dev/sda1", strlen("/dev/sda1"));
	/* error handling */
	write(fs_fd, "reserve=5", strlen(....));
	...
	dir = open("/usr/local", O_DIRECTORY);
	/* error handling */
	new_mount(dir, MNT_SET, fs_fd);	/* closes dir and fs_fd */
	/* error handling */
First open gives you a new channel. Preferably - wit datagram semantics (i.e.
write() boundaries are preserved). Then you convince fs driver to give you
fs. Then you mount it.
Notice that all cruft with "mount ncpfs and then use ioctls to authenticate"
goes away - authentication happens before you mount. Parsers are also easier
that way. Moreover, seeing what filesystem types are available is also trivial,
etc. We need only one special case - mounting that fstypefs. Fine, let's
make new_mount(dir, MNT_TYPES) do that.
BTW, bind and friends are also easy - it's
	what = open(old, 0);
	where = open(mountpoint, 0);
	new_mount(where, MNT_BIND, what);
