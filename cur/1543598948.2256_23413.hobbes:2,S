Yes, for a mirrored setup you would expect to see almost double the random
seeks and read rates equaling write rates.  I think the block size that
bonnie uses is small, so it doesn't give the RAID a chance to alternate
disks for block reads.
At least this is what seemed to happen when I was testing software RAID-1
using bonnie (not bonnie++).
What's the speed of one disk?  Can you try 2.4.8-ac9, -ac10 includes a 3ware
driver update.
I'll post some numbers from the software raid testing I was doing when I get
to work for comparison.  If anyone wants to send me a 3ware card (hint,
hint ;-), I'll gladly run some tests on that as well to compare.  Heck, I'll
even write a full review comparing 3ware to software raid!
