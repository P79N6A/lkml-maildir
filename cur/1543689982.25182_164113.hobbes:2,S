Hi Ricky, I like your patch, but have a few comments.
> The rules for config (and %config) depend on "scripts" which will build
> basically everything in scripts.  However, there are two problems with this.
> First, *config only NEEDS fixdep.
Correct.
> Second, the complete build environment is
> not setup at config time, so the compiler settings are not consistant.  To
> illustrate the point, compare scripts/.empty.o.cmd after a "make config" and
> "make image" (zImage, whatever)
Again correct, which is also why we see modpost being built so often.
A few comments to your patch:
> The "bk send" is attached.  Below is the diff.  Excuse the "@/bin/true"...
> It's the fastest way to get make to shutup.
@: is faster, and used by kbuld today.
> +scripts/fixdep:
> +	$(Q)$(MAKE) $(build)=scripts fixdep
Try to avoid special targets when the full name is OK.
No need for the fixdep target in scripts/Makefile

Nice. But notice that TOPDIR is obsolete, use srctree.
> +fixdep: $(obj)/fixdep
> +	@/bin/true
As noted above, this shortcut target is not needed.

Avoid random white space changes.

Unrelated change.

What is the purpose of this change?
If it fixes kconfig behaviour it should go separate to Roman Zippel.
