Yes, this is what I observed by reading some older articles from
linux-mm list (mostly conversation between you and Eric). So, I
decided to remove swap lockmap, reproduce problems and then try to fix
them. There is even one Eric's useful comment (removed in my patch)
that is useful in deciding what should be done to prevent problems.
But, interesting thing is that whatever I do, I CAN'T get into trouble 
and that is interesting part. :-)

Yes, I have the same worries now so close to real 2.2.0, that's why I
see this patch strictly experimental (it is not sent to Linus,
directly!). Maybe, someone of you could try it for yourself, and if
enough people test it, and if we try hard to understand why it seems
to not make thing worse, maybe there's a slight chance it could go in
for 2.2, or at least as a first thing in 2.3.0, so it gets heavily
tested and debugged.
But, I'm also nervous about it...
I rememeber there really were some nasty silent deaths while lockmap was
removed in some revisions during 2.1.x. :-(
Thanks for comments.
