Subject: Bug in 2.4.26 in mm/filemap.c when using RLIMIT_RSS

Use of rlim[RLIMIT_RSS] in mm/filemap.c is wrong.
It is passed down to kernel as a number of bytes but is being used as a
number of pages.
There is also a misinformative comment in fs/proc/array.c
in proc_pid_stat where it says
mm ? mm->rss : 0, /* you might want to shift this left 3 */
the number 3 should probably be PAGE_SHIFT-10.
