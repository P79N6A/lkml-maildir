Since false positives due to off slab slab management seem to occur
often of late, how about adding some comments to slab.c?
Thanks,

Adds some comments to slab.c.
Also, checks if we get a valid slabp_cache for off slab slab-descriptors.
We should always get this. If we don't, then in that case we,
will have to disable off-slab descriptors for this cache and do the 
calculations again. This is a rare case,  so add a BUG_ON, for now, 
just in case.
