The i82365 thing is for old i82365-compatible 16-bit pcmcia controllers.
CONFIG_CARDBUS is for cardbus controllers.
The confusion is because cardbus used to be handled by the i82365 driver
too, and then CONFIG_CARDBUS was just an option to that driver. Now
cardbus is a standalone driver in itself (a cardbus controller has
backwards compatibility registers so that it is a reasonably proper
superset of an old i82365).

Try CONFIG_PCMCIA=y CONFIG_CARBUS=y (ie both in-kernel), and see if that
solves it. That's what I use.
Getting CONFIG_PCMCIA=m working _should_ be just a matter of getting the
object file dependencies right. I saw some patches floating around towards
that end, but I haven't had time to look at them..
