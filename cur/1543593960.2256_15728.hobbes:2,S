I ran some more tests yesterday with a little more RAM than last 
time and Rik's kernel performed much better than the vanilla kernel 
in the face of memory pressure when it was very busy. I could get 
both kernels into situations where they were unresponsive but these 
periods of time were much shorter with Rik's than with vanilla 
2.4.6-pre2.  A background kernel compile completed much faster  on
Rik's version on a fairly busy web server with 128MB of RAM.
I goofed and forwarded the vmstat logs to the linux-mm
mailing list so there is a huge message there with my results :-/
but I can forward them to anyone interested.
