UML helps the "boot/crash/reboot" cycle (and that sort of debugging was in
fact one of the early design goals of IBM's CP/67 and VM/370 systems). but
it doesn't help the fact that the infrastructure provided to kernel functions
is vastly different than the glibc-based infrastructure available in userspace....
