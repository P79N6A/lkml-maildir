Does anyone know why redhat keeps doing these strange modifications?
Over the years, I've encountered quite a few problems caused by redhat
messing things up.  A few examples:
- gcc 2.96
- A rather recent redhat version shipped with a broken 'sort'
  command.  It performed a seemingly random permutation.
- Redhat 9 perl doesn't treat rexexps the same way a clean perl of the
  same version does.
Anyway, I guess it could be over soon, if only people would understand
to stay away from that fedora stuff.
