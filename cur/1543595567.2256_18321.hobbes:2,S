The last one I've put on anonftp was against 2.4.6-pre2 (namespaces-a-S6-pre2,
on ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro). It still includes tons of fs/super.c cleanups
and fixes - they still need to be merged into the tree.

Erm... The last umount should sync everything on given fs. You don't
read a hundred megabytes upon mount but you can easily get such amount
of dirty data after working for a while ;-)
