Subject: [PATCH] asm-i386 : config.h should not be included out of kernel

Hi,
It seems that in include/asm-i386/param.h the "#include
<linux/config.h>" should be inside the #ifdef __KERNEL__, as it is done
in asm-ia64.
Some applications cannot compile/work correctly whithout this patch. For
example busybox defines for itself CONFIG_TR (related to the tr
program), which is unfortunately undefined when including sys/param.h,
which includes linux/config.h (CONFIG_TR is the config for token ring).
Can you consider the following patch ?
Thanks,
Olivier
