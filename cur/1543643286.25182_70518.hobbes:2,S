If you mean using iptables on bridged packets, this is possible with the br-nf 
patch. It is not trivial however, 2 new fields to the sk_buff need to be 
added, a small change in the IP fragment code and a small change in 
ip_tables.c, a change to netfilter.h and netfilter.c. The br-nf patch has 
been under development for over 1.5 years, most work done by Lennert with me 
helping now and then...
So, if you would accept br-nf, that would be great. I think Lennert and me 
would need some time to agree on a few things before submitting anything, 
however...

Cool, looking forward to his comments.
