Hello.  I've got a couple of IBM 35.7 GB DeskStar IDE drives which
seem to confuse Linux and fdisk as they report >65535 cylinders when
probed.
hde: IBM-DPTA-353750, 35772MB w/1961kB Cache, CHS=72680/16/63
hdf: IBM-DPTA-353750, 35772MB w/1961kB Cache, CHS=72680/16/63
hdg: IBM-DPTA-353750, 35772MB w/1961kB Cache, CHS=72680/16/63
Now fdisk gets really confused as the HDIO_GETGEO ioctl returns
(unsigned short)drive->bios_cyl which is equal to 72680 % 65535 = 7145
cylinders.  This is about 10% of the actual drive capacity.
It's possible to use the fdisk expert menu to fool around with the CHS
settings and create a usable partition, but afterwards fdisk *still*
gets things wrong with respect to the actual number of cylinders on
the drive although by a slightly different margin - 8191.
Is there any reason why there is a 32-bit limit on the number of
cylinders apart from the ATAPI spec? (-: It would be nice to have
Linux support these drives straight off.
Tim.
