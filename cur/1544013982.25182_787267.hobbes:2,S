Or why not a subdirectory called "tracers" inside kernel/trace to store
the tracers files. This way, the core of tracing (ftrace.c/ring_buffer.c/trace_output.c/
/trace.c/trace_stat.c) can be found easily against the rest. Moreover, there is a risk that
the number of tracers will tend to increase by the time.
