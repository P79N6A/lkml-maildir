Probably the Bell Labs one. I did an optimizer on the Pcode which caught 
jumps to jumps, then had separate 8080 and L66 code generators into GMAP 
on the GE and the CP/M assembler or the Intel (ISIS) assembler for 8080. 
There was also an 8085 code generator using the "ten undocumented 
instructions" from the Dr Dobbs article. GE actually had a contract with 
Intel to provide CPUs with those instructions, and we used them in the 
Terminet(r) printers.
Those were the days ;-)
