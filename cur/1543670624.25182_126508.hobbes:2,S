It is used in a couple more of places in the x86-64 architecture specific
code. Of course it is legal there too.
Also there are some corner cases; e.g. some architecture specific
code (particularly the 32bit emulations) just does access_ok or 
get_user/put_user (with implied access_ok) on the first element 
of a structure and then accesses the other elements with __*_user.
This works because these architectures have an unmapped hole at the 
end of the user address space.
But in most other cases (in general outside arch/) it is very likely
a bug and a security hole.
