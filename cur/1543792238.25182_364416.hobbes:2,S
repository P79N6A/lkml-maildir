No.  Use __bitwise.  See the lkml archives for how to do this properly.

No, never typedef a struct.  That's just wrong.  gcc should warn you
just the same if you pass the wrong struct pointer (and all of your code
builds without warnings, right?)

If it does, it should say not to use it at all :)
Except for this case, it's special...
