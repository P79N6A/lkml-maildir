You need to use the correct kind of cross-over cable for the Gigabit
ports. Then, you need to set both ports manually because there
is no hardware (the switch) to handle the auto-configuration. The
default is usually `autoneg on`. This tells the switch to
auto-configure. Connected to another port, not a switch, this
means nothing and the device remains dormant.
You do this with `ethtool`. Set both to full-duplex and they should
work. Also, there is no "carrier". This is all multi-phase NRZ.
