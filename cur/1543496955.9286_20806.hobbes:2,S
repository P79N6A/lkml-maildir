Hi,
here a ptrace question; get_long and put_long in arch/i386/kernel/ptrace.c
both contain:
[...]
        /* This is a hack for non-kernel-mapped video buffers and similar */
        if (MAP_NR(page) >= MAP_NR(high_memory))
                return 0;
[...]
rsp.
[...]
/* this is a hack for non-kernel-mapped video buffers and similar */
        if (MAP_NR(page) < max_mapnr)
                *(unsigned long *) (page + (addr & ~PAGE_MASK)) = data;
[...]
Is there any reason why we don't attempt to handle requests for addresses
with MAP_NR(page) >= MAP_NR(high_memory) correctly?  I've got a pending
bug report for the MIPS port where somebody complains that the respective
code for MIPS prevents accessing the hardware directly from GDB.
TIA,
  Ralf
