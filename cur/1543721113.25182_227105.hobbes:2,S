I don't mind giving it a try, but as I said in my original reply I'm way
out of my league here. First of all I'm not the author of the original
patch, all I did was to try and update it to apply cleanly against
2.4.27-pre5. Secondly I don't have the hardware, so the only testing I can
do is check that it compiles cleanly and then test boot a kernel to see if
it blows up.
But sure, I'll see if I can get it worked into 2.6, that'll be a nice
challenge, but I'll probably be needing some help along the way.

To be honest, I have no idea.
