Sorry, tons of people that have absolute no clue about the package
internals set up their systems themselves and make mistakes.  nothing
spectacular, but they just don't have those people who know the
packages in detail and can notice and fix the bugs.  Just get binary
rpm/deb whatever of the toolchain and reproduce.

but having people who understand the software maintain the
packages sometimes helps :)
