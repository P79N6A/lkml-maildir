I believe this is now a myth.  Toshiba's weird A20 problems should
have been worked around for a long, long time; and I believe the
latest set of changes in 2.4 should make that thouroughly complete.
In fact, if your bzImages don't work either, I suspect your problems
isn't at all one of zImage vs bzImage but that there is a separate bug
that's biting you independently.

zImage format will probably be removed in the 2.5 series.  It's
virtually impossible to fit a practical 2.4 kernel within the zImage
size limits.
