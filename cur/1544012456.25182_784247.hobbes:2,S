Hey, don't forget exotic filesystems that pack that together anyway.
And if I fired up du right, then...
$ find . -iname "*.gz" | xargs du -cs -B 4096 | grep total
7086    total
$ echo $[7086*4096]
29024256
$ echo $[29024256-24782942]
4241314
So that's like 4M going off for the block stuff. Given that
the compression actually saved about 50 MB, I think we
can live with the 4M - especially since they have been
there already one way or another.

tarfs, it's somewhere around the corner on the fuse pages probably.
