Ok, so what Linus said is true for any code that _Linus_ wrote up  
until this point.  It is perfectly fine for the iptables developers  
to say "I think linking with my GPL IPTables code for makes your code  
a derivative work of mine", although I don't really have the legal  
knowledge to argue technical points either way.
Corporations change their mind on licensing all the time; though you  
can never revoke privileges you already granted on existing  
materials. As soon as you start creating new material (in the Linux  
case at a rate of multiple megs per month) you can set new licensing  
requirements on that new code as long as it's compatible with the  
requirements on the old code which it's linked against.
