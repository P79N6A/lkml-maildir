So are you volunteering to maintain the port?  Maintainers are MIA; the
damn thing doesn't compile; all patches it gets are basically blind
ones ("we have that API change, this ought to take care of those drivers
and let's hope that possible mistakes will be caught by testers").
Considering the lack of testers (kinda hard to test something that
refuses to build), the above actually spells in one word: "bitrot".
Either somebody shows up and takes over the damn thing, or it's just a
dead weight that could as well be left in linux-2.6.6.tar.bz2 on
kernel.org and not propagated any further.  If at some later point
somebody will decide to resurrected, they can always pick it from
said tarball.
