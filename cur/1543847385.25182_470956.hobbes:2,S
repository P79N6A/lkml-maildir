I don't see any reason, why it must be added to timer.c. You can achieve
the same result with calling the code outside, except that the compiler
might miss some inline optimization. The switch clock code is not a
hotpath and so it does not matter whether it is called here or there.

Then please get an agreement with John and Roman, so we can move it now.
