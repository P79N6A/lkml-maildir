I know of two others ...
sym2 has:
#define DMA_DAC_MASK    0x000000ffffffffffULL /* 40-bit */
and aic7xxx has:
        const uint64_t   mask_39bit = 0x7FFFFFFFFFULL;
Would you mind respinning your patch to include these?

himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
