Hi Robert,
There are, this is the relevant output of the process list:
 ...
 4659 pts/6    Ss     0:00 -bash
 4671 pts/5    R+     0:12 cp -a test-dir/ new-test
 4676 ?        D      0:00 [pdflush]
 4679 ?        D      0:00 [pdflush]
 4687 pts/4    D+     0:01 hdparm -t /dev/sda
 4688 ?        D      0:00 [pdflush]
 4690 ?        D      0:00 [pdflush]
 4692 ?        D      0:00 [pdflush]
 ...
This was when I was copying a directory and then doing a performance test with 
hdparm in a separate shell.  The hdparm process was in [D+] state and 
basically waited until the cp was finished.  During the whole thing there 
were up to 5 pdflush processes in [D] state.
The 5 minute load average hit 8.90 during this test.
Does that help?
Jason

Are there some processes stuck in D state? These will contribute to the
load average even if they are not using CPU.
