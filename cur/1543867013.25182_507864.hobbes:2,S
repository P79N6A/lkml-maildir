The problem is we don't know what the PNP layer does about the routing
here. It could be breaking the wifi but it's only a possible cause. It
still shouldn't be using IRQ 4 after pnp had it.
I'm also a little suprised to see both pnp and ACPI triggering. I thought
it wasn't permitted to use both at once but that really wants asking of
an ACPI guru like Len.
Does it work if you compile out PNP bios support ?
