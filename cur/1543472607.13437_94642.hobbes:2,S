Hello guys,
I get a master fd from open("/dev/ptmx", O_RDWR) and the /dev/pts/0 node is
created happily but how do I discover that it is mine? I.e. I expect
ptsname(fdm) to return the path which I can then open.
But there is no ptsname() nore is there grantpt(). What am I to do?
My system is glibc2 (as supplied with Red Hat 5.1)
