Without having looked at the implementation yet...
We should have done this ten years ago :(
We're now in the situation where numerous different subsystems have
implemented private mechnisms for tuning their printk verbosity levels.
Have you taken a look across the tree with a view to converting some of
them?  If so, how sizeable/messy/feasible would that task be?
The situation is far, far worse with compile-time debugging selection.  We
have over two hundred different implementations of dprintk!
Have you considered the feasibility of ploddingly converting each of those
drivers, one at a time over to the new infrastructure?  Because that's what
we should do, I'm afraid.
An implication of this is that once a dprintk-using driver has been
converted over to use your new infrastructure, it should still be possible
to fully disable the debugging at compile time.  Do you handle that?

ah, so you have looked.  How nasty will it be?
A couple of things:
- Your design handles a boolean on/off control.  But some code implements
  a verbosity-level control.  Thoughts on this?
- I expect that other code implements a field-selector control, for the
  lack of a better term: an greater-than-one number of separate boolean
  controls.  How to handle this?
Thanks for working on this.  If we can get this underway and get a decent
amount of conversion done, it will be a huuuuuuuuuuuuge cleanup to the
kernel.  But we will need to design it carefully first.
I guess one good testcase would be ALSA.  It has pretty fancy debugging
control (which I apparently have never been smart enough to understand). 
Did you take a look at what they're doing, with a view to
can-we-switch-ALSA-to-use-this?
