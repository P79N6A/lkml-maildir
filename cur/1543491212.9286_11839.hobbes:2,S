Subject: 2.2.x SMP hang right after "OK, booting the kernel"

Hi,
I (and some more people, I saw in Dejanews) have the following problem:
when booting an 2.2.x SMP kernel with LILO from HD, the kernel is
uncompressed (it says), the message "OK, booting the kernel" appears
and then the system stops.  Without any error message, without an oops,
or whatever.  On the other hand, booting the same kernel without a
bootloader from floppy or booting a non-SMP kernel with LILO from HD
works fine.
Configuration: Intel SC450NX MB with 4x Pentium II Xeon 450 Mhz (1 MB),
1 GB memory, kernel 2.2.3, 2.2.4, 2.2.4ac1 (I tried all), LILO 0.20.
Any help is appreciated.
Thanks,
