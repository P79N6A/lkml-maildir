Hi Herbert,
I just recently discovered that your patch that rearranges struct
aes_ctx in padlock-aes.c breaks the alignment rules for xcrypt leading
to GPF Oopses.
Note that *all* addresses passed to xcrypt must be 16-Bytes aligned for
VIA C3 (including IV and Key - the latter one was not aligned and
triggered this Oops).
As the rearrange patch made it to 2.6.18-rc1 it must be fixed before
2.6.18 is out. Attached is a patch.
Michal
