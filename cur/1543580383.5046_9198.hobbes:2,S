I am using "Pixel View TV tuner card" based on "bttv". It works perfect 
in Windows with default TV application, and also responding well in 
Linux 2.2.17 and 2.4.0-test10 kernel. The device is getting detected 
perfectly by 2.4 kernel but I could not be able to check whether the 
card in 2.4 kernel is responding on PAL-BG signal (here, my frequency 
table is PAL-BG, country India) as none of the Linux apps (xawtv, 
cabletv) are responding positively.
