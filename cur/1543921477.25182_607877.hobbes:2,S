we do pull_rt_task() in idle_balance() so, I think, there is no need
to do it twice.
i.e.
         if (unlikely(!rq->nr_running))
                 idle_balance(cpu, rq);
+       else
+               schedule_balance_rt(rq, prev);
hum?
moreover (continuing my previous idea on "don't pull more than 1 task
at once"), I wonder whether you really see cases when more than 1 task
have been successfully _pushed_ over to other run-queues at once...
I'd expect the push/pull algorithm to naturally avoid such a
possibility. Let's say we have a few RT tasks on our run-queue that
are currently runnable (but not running)... the question is 'why do
they still here?'
(1) because the previous attempt to _push_ them failed;
(2) because they were not _pulled_ from other run-queues.
both cases should mean that other run-queues have tasks with higher
prios running at the moment.
yes, there is a tiny window in schedule() between deactivate_task() [
which can make this run-queue to look like we can push over to it ]
and idle_balance() -> pull_rt_task() _or_ schedule_balance_rt() ->
pull_rt_task() [ where this run-queue will try to pull tasks on its
own ]
_but_ the run-queue is locked in this case so we wait in
double_lock_balance() (from push_rt_task()) and run into the
competition with 'src_rq' (which is currently in the 'tiny window' as
described above trying to run pull_rt_task()) for getting both self_rq
and src_rq locks...
this way, push_rt_task() always knows the task to be pushed (so it can
be a bit optimized) --- as it's either a newly woken up RT task with
(p->prio > rq->curr->prio) _or_ a preempted RT task (so we know 'task'
for both cases).
To sum it up, I think that the pull/push algorithm should be able to
naturally accomplish the proper job pushing/pulling 1 task at once (as
described above)... any additional actions are just overhead or there
is some problem with the algorithm (ah well, or with my understanding
:-/ )
