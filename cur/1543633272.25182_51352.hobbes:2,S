The symlink file can have more functions as you have stated, and one
of them is symlink. It works in Windows and it works in cygwin. Support
for symlinks on vfat is similar to long names, for example -- you
could live with abbreviations but it's reasonable to be compatible
with the other party.

It's not. The content of the file is not nicely readable. And
operation done on the file in Windows and on Linux (like writing the
file) now differs because Windows (and cygwin) follow the symlink
while Linux with vfat mounted does not.

Similar reason why the vfat support is in, isn't it? :-)

It's not "want symlinks", it's more like "want similar behaviour" and
"be compatible".
