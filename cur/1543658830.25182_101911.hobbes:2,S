[ disclaimer: the UnitedLinux issue in the subject is already resolved ]
This is wrong. Section 3 of the GPL says that you have to accompany the
binaries either with the complete source code (and this includes all
patches you have applied) or with a "written offer, valid for at least
three years, to give any third party for a charge no more than your cost
of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code".
