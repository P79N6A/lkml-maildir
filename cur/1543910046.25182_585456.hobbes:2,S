This came across my mind again earlier, and I went digging.
Can you explain how this works?
I've eyeballed the ext2/ext3 code, and feel like I'm missing something obvious.
I'm guessing that for eg, with /usr/include/stdio.h, we check the inodes
for all four parts of path, and if any of them are +A we avoid the
atime update ?  If so, where does that inheritance happen in the code?
