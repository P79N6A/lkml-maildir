ok, I tried, but my "better ideas" made things worse. stop_machine_run() wins:
void __kprobes arch_arm_kprobe(struct kprobe *p)
{
        struct kprobe_ctlblk *kcb = get_kprobe_ctlblk();
        unsigned long status = kcb->kprobe_status;
        struct ins_replace_args args;
        args.ptr = p->addr;
        args.old = p->opcode;
        args.new = BREAKPOINT_INSTRUCTION;
        kcb->kprobe_status = KPROBE_SWAP_INST;
        stop_machine_run(swap_instruction, &args, NR_CPUS);
        kcb->kprobe_status = status;
}
It works, and I guess at this point is the only way to do it. I'll send out a 
full patch with this and the other cleanups later.
