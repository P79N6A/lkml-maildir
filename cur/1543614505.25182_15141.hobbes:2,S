I second this. Being a translator of the file in question, I have to deal
with ten slightly different versions of "You may also compile this as
a module...". So I have ten slighlty different translations of this text,
too, in the name of accuracy.
Although I thought there was an agreement that decimal kilobyte is kB,
and binary kilobyte is KiB, decimal megabyte is MB, binary megabyte is MB
and so on, wasn't there?
