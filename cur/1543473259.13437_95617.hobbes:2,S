Trick question; "Is this correct?"
     N / 1024                 = kilobytes
     N / (1024 * 1024)        = megabytes
     N / (1024 * 1024 * 1024) = gigabytes
No dictionary I have available defines any of these. Even IEEE Software
Engineering Standards (3rd Addition) doesn't define. The closest I
found was kilobit (1000 bits). This is in Webster's New Collegiate
Dictionary, 1996.
So, what is the definitive reference that is irrefutable and defines these
terms?  This should be answered before we change anything. It just might
be that a kilobyte, megabyte, and gigabyte should be in decimal terms like
kilohertz, megahertz, and gigahertz -- and we've been wrong all along. 
Note that the usual "1.44MB" floppy is 1.40625 MB. 
18 * 160 * 512 = 1,474,560
      / 1024   = 1,440
      / 1024   - 1.40625
It looks to me as though the world has been dividing megabytes by 1,000
to get gigabytes all along.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
