Shucks, I know how to initialize a pointer.  I even know how to initialize
a read-write semaphore.  The problem here is not _doing_ the
initialization; it's what _value_ to use.  Kernel threads don't have a
userpace memory component, so naturally current->mm is NULL -- there's no
memory map for it to point to.  Without having a memory map, of course
there's no semaphore to initialize, since the semaphore is _part_ of the 
memory map structure.
