After fixing my gcc stupidity
             Elapsed:    User:   System:     CPU:
high pte:    49.962s  578.888s   99.048s  1356.2%
  lowpte:    49.630s  576.242s   90.158s  1342.0%
    ukva:    50.122s  577.164s   88.958s  1328.4%
The increase in elapsed is probably within tolerances.  The system time
isn't :)  The decrease in system time compared to lowpte comes because
the PTE pages are allocated in highmem, and are node-local.  
Differential profiles are up in a bit.
