Oh, clusters are a separate issue. I'm absolutely 100% conviced that you
don't want to have a "single kernel" for a cluster, you want to run
independent kernels with good communication infrastructure between them
(ie global filesystem, and try to make the networking look uniform).
Trying to have a single kernel for thousands of nodes is just crazy. Even
if the system were ccNuma and _could_ do it in theory.
The NuMA work can probably take single-kernel to maybe 64+ nodes, before
people just start turning stark raving mad. There's no way you'll have
single-kernel for thousands of CPU's, and still stay sane and claim any
reasonable performance under generic loads.
So don't confuse the issue with clusters like that. The "set_affinity()"
call simply doesn't have anything to do with them. If you want to move
processes between nodes on such a cluster, you'll probably need user-level
help, the kernel is unlikely to do it for you.
