It is plausible that individual _lwp_create(2) is faster than individual
clone(CLONE_VM) one (possibly between 5x and 10x times, the 1000x figure
is ridiculous). However, one should look a bit further and ask if native
kernel-level UW7 lwps are delivering the same set of rich functionality as
Linux clone'd tasks. IMHO, they simply don't. So one has to add all the
overhead of turning a "raw" lwp into a useful and useable thread, e.g. as
used by userspace thread concept. If you do that, no doubt you will find
that Linux performance is greater than of any commercial alternatives.
So, until Juergen points us to a ftp://... URL where one can download his
Linux kernel emulation layer for UW7 kernel (and, of course, I assume no
GPL breakage is done?) which I can pkgadd on my UW7 machine and run some
multi-threaded Linux app and see it "1000x times faster", I will ignore
the theregister article as meaningless hype. Go and thou do likewise ;)
