You're right, thanks for the report. The fix is appended ;)

I'm using touch in one place, as an optimization. For all I can see it
should be fine unless you run more than one complete build per second ;)
(Whenever a .ver file is updated, include/linux/modversions.h is touched,
 so that during the build make only needs to check the timestamp
 of modversions.h instead of all the individual .ver files - do you see a
 problem with that?)
