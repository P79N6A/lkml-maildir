It's not.

Just read the Debian Free Software Guidelines.  You can't do that if
you want cdrecord stay in main and not go to non-free.  See paragraph
#3 of DFSG: "The license must allow modifications and derived works"
and paragraph #8: "License Must Not Be Specific to Debian".  Also note
#5: "No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups".

Those "defective variants" (which are NOT defective for me) clearly
state that they are *not* the original version and problems/bugs
should be reported to suse (as suggested by the GPL paragraph you are
refering to).  An it's not somewhere hidden, but printed every single
time you start it to the terminal, four lines long.
