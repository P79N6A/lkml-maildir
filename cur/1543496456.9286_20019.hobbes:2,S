Impacting runtime performances to SMP scale better, is going to lose
according to me. I think that if you want to SMP scale better it worth to
pay _only_ with memory wastage and _not_ with wasted CPU cycles.
But as just said masp0008 raised the issue of the io_request_lock that is
just held all the time so we can't scale better at all even using one
spinlock per bit of memory in the machine :-). This is the only thing that
obviously convinced me to remove the spinlock immediatly.
My latest code is placed here. masp0008 feel free to give it a review.
