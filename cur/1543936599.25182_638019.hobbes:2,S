I do wonder whether the PSU could've been causing it. Now that think
about it, I got the PSU around two years ago, just like I compiled 
2.6.14. This PSU coincidentally seems to have been the cause of the 
crash that started this thread, and went completely silent during 
the same day, on the third crash. But even if the PSU could cause
the timer interrupt to signal too frequently or so, doesn't explain
why nearly always after a crash (when journal recovery would be the
normal course of action), fsck starts checking with absurd intervals
since last check, whereas there's no trouble booting after normal
shutdown.
