There is a difference between "no capabilities" and "undefined capabilities".
The kernel can do whatever is best for the undefined case, perhaps under
the influence of a configuration option.

This is getting really silly of course. It means you have to give
special rights to emacs, dd, perl, patch, gzip, tar, ln, gcc...
If you really are that insane, you can have a config option for it.
I doubt that it is helpful to require that every tool have bits set.

Eh, what problem?
