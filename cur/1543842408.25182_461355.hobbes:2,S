  Ho, hum, I think I see what is hapenning. I think we steal the buffer
from commit in journal_dirty_data() (called e.g. from ext3_writepage()).
There we also take care of writing out the buffer so it's mostly OK.
Except that the commit code still keeps the reference to the buffer in
wbuf[]. So the right solution along the lines of your one would be to
check that each buffer in wbuf[] is buffer_jbd(), belongs to the right
transaction and list and only in that case run submit_bh() on it...
