I did the cat /proc/acpi/event shortly after implementing my script and 
finding out it was continually being called after pressing the power 
button.  I got/(still get):
button/power PWRF 00000080 00000001
...
button/power PWRF 00000080 00006bbb
... etc.
Of course, with 2.6.0-test1-mm2, it would stop when I restarted acpid or 
pushed the power button again.  With 2.6.0-test2-mm1 that has changed in 
that stopping the events requires a reboot.
I can recompile my 2.4.18 with ACPI support and see what happens if that 
is necessary...just let me know.
Thanks.
