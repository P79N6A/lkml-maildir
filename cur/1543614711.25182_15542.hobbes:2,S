I think one thing to note is that dependencies is that if you are smart
about it, dependencies -really- do not even change when your .config
changes.
What about a system where Linus runs "make deps" -once- before he
releases a tarball.  This in turn generates dependency information
(perhaps not in purely make format) which includes 'ifdef CONFIG_xxx'
information embedded within.  We know that make can support ifeq
CONFIG_xxx for example...
