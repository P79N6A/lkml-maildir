this has been very recently asked on the list. some of the suggested answers were:
books:
. linux kernel development by robert love
. linux device drivers by Alessandro Rubini and Jonathan Corbet.
. understanding linux kernel by Daniel P. Bovet and Marco Cesati.
(last two will have new editions soon covering 2.6 kernels)
regards,
pedro venda.
