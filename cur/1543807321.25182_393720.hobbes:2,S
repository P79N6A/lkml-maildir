We're talking to the hardware directly. There's a potential race where 
the BIOS will try to access the cmos at the same time, with potentially 
interesting results (We set the address we want to read with the outb. 
The BIOS runs, outbs its own address, and then reads. We then read from 
the address the BIOS was looking at, rather than what we were looking 
at).
On all the hardware this will run on, IRQ 8 is the RTC. I don't believe 
it can share interrupts.
