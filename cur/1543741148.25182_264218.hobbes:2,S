Hi all...
I'm trying to make a small modification to the Kconfig files, but I can't
get the menu layout match what I want.
Say I want this logic:
menu "A support"
  config A_1
    tristate "A-1"
  config A_2
    tristate "A-2"
  config A_GENERIC_FEATURE_1
    bool "AF1"
    depends on A_1 || A_2
  config A_GENERIC_FEATURE_2
    bool "AF2"
    depends on A_1 || A_2
endmenu
A_GENERIC_FEATURE_1 is valid for both submodels. Logic is right, but
gconfig insists on putting AF1 as a subentry of A_2, instead of hanging
it in the menu. I would like:
  A support
   \- A-1
   \- A-2
   \- AF1 (visible only when A-1 or A-2 are selected)
   \- AF2 (visible only when A-1 or A-2 are selected)
but I get
  A support
   \- A-1
   \- A-2
      \- AF1 (visible only when A-1 or A-2 are selected)
      \- AF2 (visible only when A-1 or A-2 are selected)
(ie, both optional features haged on A-2)
What am I doing wrong ? Is there any way to defeat the auto-layout
based on depedencies of kbuild ?
TIA
