Thanks, I'll retest without this fix on the current l-m.o git master and see
if it still solves our errata.

I couldn't find hooks for platform specific serial_in/out functions.
Do you mean using the up->port.iotype's in serial_in/out from 8250.c?

A serial_in(up, UART_IIR) calls occur in more places that just the interrupt
handler (i.e. autoconfig*, serial8250_start_tx, etc). We will need to check
if we are in an interrupt on each IIR read, hopefully that won't be too much
overhead!

Sounds good to me, it would give us a location to store the address of the
UART_STATUS_REG required by this UART variant.
