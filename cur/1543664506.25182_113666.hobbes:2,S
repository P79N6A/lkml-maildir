Hi Jörn,
Like you, I do get the joke: but in this case as in others, I took the view 
that the needs of those whose first language was not English should prevail. 
(Yes, I also know about the convention that the kernel is defined to be in 
English.)
And, being not yet of even janitor status (:-)) myself, I did not submit the 
patch: I guess whoever does that has the final call!
Cheers, Shaheed
