The code seems very complex for such a conceptually simple problem.
And doubts remain whether it is correct on particular wordsize/endianness
machines.
It seems that there is a layering violation in which this code is poking
around inside representations which should known only to the particular
architecture.  Hence, if we can find a way to provide this function using
existing architecture API's (test_bit) then everything is solved.
If this code needs some arch-provided support function then so be it. 
That's better than adding a tangle of ifdefs in generic code.

You can never provide too many comments!
Anyway, please wake me up again when you and Joe have finished.  (I agree
that making that function take a number of bits is better than taking a
number of bytes btw).
