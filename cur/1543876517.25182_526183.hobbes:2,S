afaics, setting the 'please freeze asap' flag is racy wrt dup_task_struct
(where the child's tsk->thread_info->flags are copied from its parent?). 
Secondly, from what I understand, it takes a 'flag to be set + signal marked
pending' for the child task to be frozen. If that is the case, then
copy_process may not propogae the signal to the child, which could mean
mean that we can be in a catch-up game in freeze_processes, trying to
freeze processes we didnt see in earlier passes.
I think copy_process() can check for something like this:
	write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock);
	...
	if (freezing(current))
		freeze_process(p);	/* function exported by freezer */
	...
	write_unlock_irq(&tasklist_lock);
