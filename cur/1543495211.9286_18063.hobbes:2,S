In the March/April issue of IEEE Software, there was an interview with
Brian Kernighan...(its not on line yet).  Obviously Ken didn't ask
Brian for his opinion...
Software: What od you think of Linux and open source?  Do you think
open source is as powerful a development paradigm as its proponents
claim?
Kernighan: My experience with Linux, though not extensive, is very
positive.  I used it to run a Web server for a large class some years
ago, it ran for two months without a hiccup, and probably would have
run for the rest of my life, except I had to move the machine from
Massachusetts to New Jersey...
