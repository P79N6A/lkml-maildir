I believe that unless the kernel is told of these inequalities, then it
must schedule fairly.
And yes, by fairly, I mean fairly among all threads as a base resource
class, because that's what Linux has always done (and if you aggregate
into higher classes, you still need that per-thread scheduling).
So I'm not excluding extra scheduling classes like per-process, per-user,
but among any class of equal schedulable entities, fair scheduling is the
only option because the alternative of unfairness is just insane.

Well my X server has an euid of root, which would mean my X clients can
cause X to do work and eat into root's resources. Or as Ingo said, X
may not be running as root. Seems like just another hack to try to
implicitly solve the X problem and probably create a lot of others
along the way.
All fairness issues aside, in the context of keeping a very heavily
loaded desktop interactive, X is special. That you are trying to think
up funny rules that would implicitly give X better priority is kind of
indicative of that.
