Hi Ingo,
   I gave 2.6.18-rt2 a quick try. It compiled fine but crashed on
boot. I've no way to copy the screen. I can send along a digital photo
if the following isn't enough info.
QUESTION: Should I be able to run ati-drivers-8.28.8 with this kernel
or would I have to wait for ATI to put out a 2.6.18 compatible driver?
The current version does not emerge with 2.6.18-rt2.
CRASH INFO:

Not sure how much that will help you. Been awhile since I've sent
along crash reports. I'll have to ge a second Linux machine running to
do the console boot capture thing if you need it.
Hope this helps,
Mark
