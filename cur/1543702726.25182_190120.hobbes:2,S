I'm not sure if jgarzik is working on a driver or not (he never
responded to an email I sent), but I'm working on one.  The main
remaining issues I need to work on are figuring out the tx/rx buffer
management scheme the rtl8180 uses, and getting the wireless stuff
done (this is my first attempt at dealing w/ wireless nics, so associating
w/ an access point and other such things are new to me).
Unfortunately, I really have been short of time lately, so progress on the
driver has been slow.
