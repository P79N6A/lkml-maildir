Alex,
> Here, Alpha LX164, SMP, kernel 2.2.2:
	The most recent kernel (Alan Cox patches excluded) that compiles 
straight on the Alpha is 2.2.2pre4.  2.2.2pre5 introduced IA32-specific 
semaphores into ksyms.c and other kernel/ files.

	I hope to produce a patch for 2.2.2final tonight (probably around
3am with my hectic schedule).  A patch for building 2.2.2pre5 on the Alpha
is attached to this message.  This has been tested on my system 
(21164a EV56, DEC hardware), a single processor LX164, an EV4 Multia, and
a few other random boxes.  I assume it also works for building an 
SMP kernel, but have not tested it myself.

	Right, we are aware of this.  I corresponded with Dave Miller
(sparc64 guru) on this last night, and he pointed me in the right direction
for working on axp semaphores.  
Regards,
Daniel
