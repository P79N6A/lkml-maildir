Alan,
     My point was that you would want to have DRM working on Radeon cards,
right ? And there are complexities of current Radeon hardware that one 
would have to deal with, no matter how simple it might be to do the same 
thing for embedded.
     Lastly, I am not saying you have to put all the code in the same file.
All I am saying we can mandate that all Radeon HW specific code is linked
in one module - and this would make things easier for developers.
     Alternatively, you can have a complicated scheme whereby you load FB 
and DRM drivers in any order. But DRM would want FB (or part of it) to be 
present anyway so it should be able to recover from engine lockup.
     I would agree that this can be coded as well - but why bother ? Or is 
it done and working already ?
                         best
                           Vladimir Dergachev
