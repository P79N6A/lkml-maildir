How did you configure the kernel -- config, xconfig, menuconfig or
oldconfig?  This basically looks like parport support isn't enabled at
all (CONFIG_PARPORT).  Check in .config for the parport-related options.
When you're linking everything into the kernel you'll want a low-level
port driver such as CONFIG_PARPORT_PC too, of course.
