I think .bss section size will act as a buffer for decompressor only if
.bss is not part of compressed data hence decompressor does not have to
move beyond bss and it can run very well from kernel bss space. 
But somehow on my machine, it looks like that bss is very much part
of raw binary image hence part of compressed data (vmlinux.bin.gz).
memsz exported in bzImage is same as size of raw output binary.
Probably that's the reason that we are stomping other segments in my
case and if my understanding is right then it should happen irrespective
of kernel bss size.
Here I am pasting how kernel vmlinux file program headers look like.
.bss is mapped by first program header along with .text.
