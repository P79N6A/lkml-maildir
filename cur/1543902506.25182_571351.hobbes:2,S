Hope it should work like the following [Please correct me if I'm wrong]:
- Make the device the last irqaction in the list
- Our dummy handler will always return IRQ_HANDLED in case any other
previous
  irqaction did not return such. It will also issue the timer and mask
the irq in this case.
  The line is temporarily jammed but not disabled - note_interrupt()
will not consider 
  our irq unhandled and won't disable it.
  btw, if I'm not mistaken only after bad 99900/100000 the irq is
disabled.
- If the timer pops before the guest acks the irq, the timer handler
will
  ack the irq and unmask it. The timer's job is only to prevent
deadlocks.
Maybe it's better to code it first then send RFC.
Or wanted to get a feed back before hand to hear opinions and to know
whether to use the 
deferred option or the irq polarity option. Both of them can lead to the
above deadlock 
without the timer hack.
Best regards, Dor.
