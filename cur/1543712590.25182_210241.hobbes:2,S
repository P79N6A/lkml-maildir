sorry, that was my mistake in wording - the modules point to the kernel 
headers.  However, the system as it was first made, had those 
directories symlinked to the 2.4.7 (?) kernel - I had to remove that 
package, and symlink the "asm", and "linux" directories to the 2.2.26 
kernel directories of the same name - I'm assuming this is the correct 
thing to do? (it did work ;)
thanks,
