I had come to the same conclusion. I upgraded to the latest drm kernel drivers 
(DRI cvs) and the message disappeared. It was a mistake to associate it with 
IO-activity. Shame on me.
On the other side, I'm using kernel -ck5, which includes reiser4 and does not 
suffer from the problem I described. I'm waiting for the next -mm release to 
see if it gets fixed there too.
BTW, thanks to all you people at xorg, you are doing a wonderful job :-)
