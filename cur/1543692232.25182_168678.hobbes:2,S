(as you can see, i'm a newbie of english speeking, and linux-kernel 
posting, so, excuse me if this is a duplicate contribution, I have 
search on the web and on the archive and fine nothing about this error.)
Error message :
VFS : Cannot open root device "302" or unknown-block(3,2)
Please append a corect "root=" boot option
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(3,2)
Kernel version : 2.6.0-test5
System : Toshiba Satellite laptop
More information : Linux is installe on /deh/hda2. There 2 other kernel 
on this computer. A 2.2.20 and a 2.4.22, both of them working fine. Ia 
have try many differend option for compile the kernel, but never working 
any more. My /dev/hda2 is on ext3.
I will try soon on my other systems.
I will be hapy if I can help in any kind, so, at this time, i'm going 
back to 2.4.22. (Need I to poste my .config here ?)
