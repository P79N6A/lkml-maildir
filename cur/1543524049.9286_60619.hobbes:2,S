That is because MicroSoft (aka SmallLimp) most likely sets up the APM
wrt to IDE and may do a protective area write to the drive.
Since Linux avoids this practice until I get the full scope, then we still
will not do it, you take your chances on the DUAL boot.
Send the contents of 'lspci -bxxxvv > linux.pci' with a linux boot, then...
send the contents of 'lspci -bxxxvv > linux.98.pci' after a M$ boot first.
I expect that something is set and I may be able to clear it.
