I've been looking at the PCI option in the BIOS...
1st part is mapping IRQ to PCI slots...
Then, you have :
PCI/VGA Palette Snoop         Disabled
PCI Latency Timer             32
Primary VGA BIOS              PCI VGA Card
USB Function                  Enabled
USB2.0 Function               Enabled
Onboard LAN Boot ROM          Disabled
Maybe related, the memory config :
SDRAM Configuration           By SPD
Chipset clock mode            Synchronous
SDRam Command Lead-off time   Auto
Graphics Aperture Size        256 MB
AGP Capability                4x Mode
AGP Fast Write Capability     Enabled
Video Memory Cache Mode       UC
Memory hole at 15M-16M        Disabled
PCI 2.1 Support               Enabled
Onboard PCI IDE Enable        Both
IDE Bus Master Support        Enabled
Could it be PCI 2.1 Support ? Don't think because I've restarted
with it disabled, and I still have the same problem...
Regards,
Paul
