A recursive algorithm fed user controlled input that dictates how much
it recurses, in a kernel with a stack limit. Oh and since qsort is
O(N^2) worst case and the user controls the input thats another concern.

I find it hard to believe that a simple bucket sort wouldnt perform as
well in real life and with a defined time/space, or even something like
shell metzner if you want trivial with good typical behaviour.
Alternatively you could just do a merge pass when a new set of groups is
added.
