If you do this, then I would personally suggest a conceptually different
approach: make the LRU list count towards the page count.  That will
_automatically_ result in what you describe - if a page is on the LRU
list, then "freeing" it will always just decrement the count, and the
_real_ free comes from walking the LRU list and considering count==1 to
be trivially freeable. 
That way you don't have to have separate functions for releasing
different kinds of pages (we've seen how nasty that was from a
maintainance standpoint already with the "put_page vs
page_cache_release" thing). 
Ehh?
