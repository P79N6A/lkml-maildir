The bulk of the sync(2) will be async though, since most of the io is
actually writing dirty data buffers out.  We already do that in two
stages.
For 2.5, if an FS really wanted a two stage sync for it's non-data
pages, it could put a locked page onto one of the lists that
sync_inodes(1) will catch and wait for.  There are lots of other ways of
course, but there's already a framework for sync to wait on pages.
For 2.4, an FS async sync function could toss a locked buffer head into
the locked buffer lru list, and unlock when the commit is complete.
Neither idea is as clean as a real aio interface, but all the
infrastructure is already there. 
Also, I think async sync support is a different feature than allowing
the FS to know the difference between kupdate periodic writes and
syncs/unmounts.
