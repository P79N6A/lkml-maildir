I think these should be inverted to, something like
pbook_disable_keypad, pbook_disable_fnkeys and pbook_fnfirst.
Two reasons. First, it just makes more sense to pass a module param to
turn something on (doing powerbook_enablekeypad=0 isn't as intuitive as
pbook_disable_keypad=1). Second reason is that since these are static
vars, defaulting them to uninitialized (leaving them in the bss, as 0)
reduces binary size.
