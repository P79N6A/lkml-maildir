oh bugger it.  I've vented enough today and we're on the same page now I
think.

Ok, they share this characteristic with namespaces: that they group
processes.  So, they conceptually hang off task_struct.  But we put them
on ns_proxy because we've got this vague notion that things might be
better that way.

Cool, let's review them.

Ok, there's nothing original or useful there; I'm obviously quite deliberately still punting on the issue.

Let's go back in time to the thread I referred to:

Right.  So, now I'll also throw into the mix:
  - resource groups (I get a strange feeling of déjà vú there)
  - supply chains (think supply and demand)
  - accounting classes
Do any of those sound remotely close?  If not, your turn :)
And do we bother changing IPC namespaces or let that one slide?
Sam.
