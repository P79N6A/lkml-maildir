There is a similar thing in development at 
	bk://ldm.bkbits.net/linux-2.5-power/
Things are still a bit rough, and there isn't much documentation, as I'm 
busy trying to get it all work correctly before OLS. 
FWIW, I will be talking about this at OLS (and not the posted topic). A 
paper describing the work is here: 
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/mochel/doc/papers/power-ols2003.tar.gz
I should have more to say in the next week or two..
