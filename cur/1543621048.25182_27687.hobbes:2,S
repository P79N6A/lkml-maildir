   Yup.  Tx interrupt mitigation like this is a really neat feature. It
   can make a huge improvement in performance.  But the driver does need
   to implement a timer to fix the problem which you have described.
This reminds me how sick I am of drivers that don't define what the
heck the bits mean in the registers and descriptor flags.
Something for the Janitors I guess.
