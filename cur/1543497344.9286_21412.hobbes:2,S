On-topic:
  can someone give me a quick pointer on how to make a
  parallel iomega ditto 2 gig drive work?  I spent all weekend looking
  at the ftape readmes but if you're not using a real floppy drive, it
  isn't too helpful.
Off-topic:  (obviously, don't reply to the list for this one)
  What is the best way to print HTML in Linux?  Printing from Netscape
  looks so much better on a Windows machine that it's sickening.  I
  will have to have someone on Windows do all of my printing if I
  can't find a better way.
Thanks,
Mark
