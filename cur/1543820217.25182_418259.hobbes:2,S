I am actually working on something more or less like that as part of my 
licentiate (half time PhD) thesis. In the thesis I want to control CPU 
resources using a control theoretic approach. The results so far are 
very promising, but my code is not very mature yet. I plan to have my 
thesis ready during this summer, so if anyone is interested I can mail 
you a copy. If I have the time after that, I will try to incorporate my 
code into the CKRM framework.
