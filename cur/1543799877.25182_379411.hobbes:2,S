I too have been bored during Christmas and ran 2.6.15-rc7 as Linus asked.
Furthermore I patched it with 'adaptive read-ahead', Ingo's mutex,
Balbirs/Stevens 'slab-cache estimate optimization' and Cons 'swap
prefetch'.
I've enable 4k stacks and kernel preemption and up till now I've yet
to see one glitch.
Usage: Watching movies, using git, compiling kernel, ftp, bittorrent..
Nothing special...
Machine is a Athlon 1.3 GHz, 512 MB Ram, 46xx sound ALSA ..
