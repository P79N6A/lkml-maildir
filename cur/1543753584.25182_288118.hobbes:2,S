That would work for sleep (but glibc uses nanosleep for that) but an itimer 
delivers a signal.  Rather hard to trap that in glibc.
For what its worth, you can tell it was truncated by reading back the remaining 
time.  That could be done in the glibc wrapper and an error passed back, but 
actually doing the proper wait using this interface is rather hard.
The timer_settime(CLOCK...  interface detects overflow and passes back an error...
Clock_nanosleep on the otherhand, will sleep for the whole time, provide the 
machine doesn't turn to dust :)
