I recently had a very bad experience on my notebook with ext3 and fsck. It
had not checked the disk for 180 days, and started it... I can now estimate
about 60 files I lost in /usr (most of them in /usr/bin), but I regularly
discover new missing ones. Since this notebook has experience lots of
crashes, I think that the FS already was in bad situation, but these files
were still OK for me just before I shut it down. I cannot imagine not
noticing a "make: command not found" after a day of compilation. So I
stuffed some missing files in it again and it's OK now. I really don't
know what happened. Perhaps I fscked during a solar flare :-)
Cheers
