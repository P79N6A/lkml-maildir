I'd be happy to write a new routine in assembly, if I had a clue as to how
the VM algorithm works in Linux. What should swapoff  do if all physical
memory is in use? How does the swapping algorithm balance against
cache memory? Can someone point me to where I can find the exact
details of the VM mechanism in Linux? Thanks!
