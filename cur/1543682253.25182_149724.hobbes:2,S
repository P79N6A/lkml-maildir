Subject: [BUG] 2.4.22-pre7 ATM config breakage
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

When configuring 2.4.22-pre7 I get the drivers/atm/Config.in
questions even though I haven't enabled CONFIG_ATM.
This is because net/Config.in has
if [ "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" = "y" ]; then
   tristate 'Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) (EXPERIMENTAL)' CONFIG_ATM
while arch/i386/config.in has
      source drivers/net/Config.in
      if [ "$CONFIG_ATM" != "n" ]; then
         source drivers/atm/Config.in
With CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL disabled, CONFIG_ATM is unset, and the
test "$CONFIG_ATM" != "n" becomes true ("" != "n").
Either CONFIG_ATM shouldn't depend on CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL, or the test
should be "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" = "y" -a "$CONFIG_ATM" != "n".
