OK, right. The precision is still very good anyway.

Yep. For the record it reports a 267280004 Hz processor for a K6-266
The printk quotients are micro=16069168, nano=1004323704, both consistent.

The overflow was probably not in the calibration at all, but in
time_init() just after the calibration, where cpu_hz was calculated.
With the 4 shifts in the wrong direction it gives a factor of 256 too
high. So 256*100*10^8 is much larger than 2^32.
Not so obvious though, since the difference is that the shifts are to
make a change in the representation instead of a change in units.
