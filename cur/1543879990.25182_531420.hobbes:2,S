No. That squishes one end of the table too much.  It needs to be 
(approximately) piecewise linear around nice == 0.  Here's the mapping I 
use in my entitlement based schedulers:
#define NICE_TO_LP(nice) ((nice >=0) ? (20 - (nice)) : (20 + (nice) * 
(nice)))
It has the (good) feature that a nice == 19 task has 1/20th the 
entitlement of a nice == 0 task and a nice == -20 task has 21 times the 
entitlement of a nice == 0 task.  It's not strictly linear for negative 
nice values but is very cheap to calculate and quite easy to invert if 
necessary.

Have you tried the spa_ebs scheduler?  The half life is no longer a run 
time configurable parameter (as making it highly adjustable results in 
less efficient code) but it could be adjusted to be approximately 
equivalent to 0.5 seconds by changing some constants in the code.

You should look back through the plugsched patches where many of these 
ideas have been experimented with.
