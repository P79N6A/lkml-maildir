Hi,
I got it. It is and endless loop in drivers/pci/pcie/aspm.c:

First, I'd like to know whether I could have solved that easier.
The machine is a laptop without firewire and serial console.
It has an PCIe slot.
sysrq did not work at this point, because the keyboard is not functional
yet. Via serial console it probably would have been possible to trigger
a backtrace, you see the function where it loops -> found in 10 minutes,
but as said this machine has no serial port.
Did I miss some nice debug functionality/trick which could have found
that easier?
After I knew it is PCIe ASPM, I went through the code, found the loop,
added a printk there and some more at other places and got it...
At the end is some info for people who know more about PCI than me.
It would be great if the root cause is found/fixed.
I will provide a patch in a follow up mail to workaround the hang which
IMO (if reviewed) should go into stable kernels back to when ASPM was
added (was that .26?).
Thanks,
      Thomas
In case the machine boots fine I get:
