Timeouts and interruptible sleeps are the two ways to solve the problem.
All good drivers should have covering timeouts in case the event they
where hoping for never happens.
If the code path that assumes magic has happened after it wakes up
doesn't check its not defensive enough. Also you can make tasks
interruptible so signals can get through:
result = wait_event_interruptible(dev->waitq,dev_irq_event(dev));
if (result) {
     printk(KERN_ALERT "dev_irq_wait: Interrupted by a signal\n");
     return -ERESTARTSYS;
};
As you have noted you can't always make things interruptible, but decent
timeouts should always exist. Hardware has bugs too!
