This happened to me several times till now:
skput:under:c015b1d0:20 put:20 dev:eth0
Interrupt handler not syncing.
The machine is heavily loaded server with following configuration:
 * kernel 2.2.13
 * Solar Designer patches (2.2.13-ow1)
 * NIC: Digital DS21140 Tulip (100 Mbit)
 * SCSI: Adaptec AIC-7890
The crash happens every 2-3 days, always with the same parameters
in the printk. In System.map, nearest syscall seems to be:
c015b10c T tcp_transmit_skb
If someone wanted to investigate this problem, I can supply as detailed
information as you need. Thanks in advance.
