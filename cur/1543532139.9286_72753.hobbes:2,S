	Define 'work'. 'getpid' is hardly the only function that uses pids. What
about 'getppid'? As but one example, consider the following code:
pid_t pid=getpid(); /* This gets the pid of the original thread, not this
one */
fork();
if(getppid()==pid)
{
 /* I must be the child */
 /* But wait, am I really? */
}
