Still problems with nvidia-agp on 2.6.0-test5(-mm1). I can't track down
the problem because my box needs a hard reboot. My card is nvidia. So
they should work together. On 2.4.23-pre3, there's no problem anymore.
Works fine, but why not in 2.6.0-test5? Any ideas why it crashes? Any
fix? If you need me to investigate more. Tell me how.
