Unfortunately, the computing field is full of counter examples to that.
They tend to follow a fairly simple logic: If I hire an unskilled worker,  
I can pay him less; the problems with that approach only surface in one or  
two years. Then I simply replace one monkey with another monkey - assuming  
it's even still my problem and I haven't moved to a different job  
meantime.
Thus, as Alan said, the .com bubble.
Thus, Microsoft.

In general, that's exactly what they don't do. In fact, this not happening  
in reality is exactly why the Berne convention was written to reserve  
rights for half a century after the death of the creator.

I really, really doubt that, *unless* you *yourself* already understand  
(and I mean really *understand*) symphonies to start with.
Unless you can judge the quality of composers yourself, the money is  
rather unlikely to buy you a good one.
