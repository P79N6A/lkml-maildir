Or:
- install 
https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt/
cd /usr/src/linux
wget 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.11/2.6.11-mm1/2.6.11-mm1-broken-out.tar.gz
tar xfz 2.6.11-mm1-broken-out.tar.gz
mv broken-out patches
mv patches/series .
Now you can do `quilt push 100' to apply 100 patches, `quilt pop 50' to
remove half of them, etc.
Open a copy of the series file in an editor and add markers to it as you
proceed through the search so you don't get lost.
Avoid applying obviously-broken patches.  For example, we have, in the
series file:
posix-timers-cpu-clock-support-for-posix-timers.patch
posix-timers-cpu-clock-support-for-posix-timers-fix.patch
posix-timers-cpu-clock-support-for-posix-timers-fix3.patch
That's one patch plus two fixes to it.  You'd either apply all of these or none.
There's a bit of setup but once quilt is installed it's all pretty easy and
quick.
