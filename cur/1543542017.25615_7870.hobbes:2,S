Some hardware can generate skb->csum and set skb->ip_summed == CHECKSUM_HW
In this case only the checksum of the pseudo header is needed, and it makes 
sense to check early instead of doing it while copying to user in the fast 
path (some drivers are clever enough to know about the pseudo header too,
they set CHECKSUM_NONE after the check, but that is generally regarded as a
layer violation)
