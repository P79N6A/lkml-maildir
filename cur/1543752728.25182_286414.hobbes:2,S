The sysrq is already in 2.6.10. I had to use it the last days a few
times. But it does help if you have no access to the console.
The RT throttling idea is not to change the behavior in normal
conditions. It's only for a fatal system state. If you have a runaway RT
task you can't guarantee the system is work properly anyway. It's
blocking vital kernel threads, filesystems, swap, keyboard, ...
It's a bit like out of memory. You can do nothing and panic. Or trying
something bad (killing processes) which is hopefully better as the
former.
btw: Are RT tasks excluded by the oom killer?
