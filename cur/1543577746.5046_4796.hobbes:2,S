Hi,
on my machine (x86) I've debian2.2r2 with kernel 2.2.16 + raidtools 0.9
running. No problems. Yesterday I installed kern 2.4.0 with the same
configuration like 2.2.16. I added following to the boot params:
root=/dev/md0 md=0,/dev/hde1,/dev/hdg1
If I boot 2.4.0 I can see following:
...
<init of raid>
raid:0 md-size is 249728 blocks
raid0: conf->smallest->size is 249728 blocks
raid0: nb_zone is 1
raid0: blocking 8 bytes for hash
md: updating md0 RAID superblock on device                <<<------
<...>
... autorun DONE
md: loading md0
... md0 already autodetected -use raid=noautodetect
<...>
Parallelizing fsck version 1.18
fsck.ext2: No such file or directory while trying to open /dev/md0 (null):
The superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2
filesystem.
The filessystem is clean because I can mount it with kernel 2.2.16 without
problems. Maybe kernel 2.4.0 does the wrong in updating the RAIS superblock
on md0.
Please help!
with regards,
Oliver
