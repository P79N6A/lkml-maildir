Sorry to have been quiet on this issue for a few days. Interesting news to
report, though.  So I was working on a patch to do early apic enabling on
x86_64, and had something working for the old 2.6.18 kernel that we were
origionally testing on.  Unfortunately while it worked on 2.6.18 it failed
miserably on 2.6.24-rc3-mm2, causing check_timer to consistently report that the
timer interrupt wasn't getting received (even though we could successfully run
calibrate_delay).  Vivek and I were digging into this, when I ran accross the
description of the hypertransport configuration register in the opteron
specification.  It contains a bit that, suprise, configures the ht bus to either
unicast interrupts delivered accross the ht bus to a single cpu, or to broadcast
it to all cpus.  Since it seemed more likely that the 8259 in the nvidia
southbridge was transporting legacy mode interrupts over the ht bus than
directly to cpu0 via an actual wire, I wrote the attached patch to add a quirk
for nvidia chipsets, which scanned for hypertransport controllers, and ensured
that that broadcast bit was set.  Test results indicate that this solves the
problem, and kdump kernels boot just fine on the affected system.
I understand that enabling the apic early in the boot process is a nice general
solution, but given the wide range of apic configurations possible, and the
need for large amounts of testing of such a change, this approach seems like it
might be the better way to go, as it corrects a bad behavior only in systems
that would be affected by this problem.  It introduces no further complexity in
the kdump shutdown path, and creates no additional instability in systems that
would otherwise be unaffected by this bug. 
I think this is the best way for us to go forward.  Attached patch applies
cleanly against 2.6.24-rc3-mm2 and works for me on serveral systems unaffected
by the kdump crash problem I origionally reported and fixes the bug on the
affected system.
Thanks & Regards
Neil
