Absolutely, I agree.  My fingers even itched as I typed those lines
in.  I didn't change the wording because I couldn't come up with
anything better.

That's confusing to the implementer :-)

Good catch, fixed in my local copy.

Macros for the other routines don't exist simply because nobody
ever had a use for them.
In practice they will just work.

You still get the memory barrier, whether you read the return
value or not.

Yeah, it's the whole implicit/explicit wording issue discussed
above.
