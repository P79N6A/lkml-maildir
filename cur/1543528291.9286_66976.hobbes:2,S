Well, actually AFAIKT, it's not symbolic links as we have in UNIX-land
that's the great part.
As I understand it it's the server part actively searching for identical
files and then symlinking them, i.e. automagically.
What I can't figure out is, why it took them so many years, and are they
really first?
Because if they are first then this is the first case that I know of
Microsoft 'inventing' things.
