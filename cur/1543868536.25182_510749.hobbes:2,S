Subject: [PATCH] libata: warn if speed limited due to 40-wire cable (v2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here's a revised version of my previous patch to warn the user if a
drive's transfer rate is limited because of a 40-wire cable detection.
This one hopefully addresses Alan's previous comments - we now do this
at the very end of the function, and the ugly if condition has been
cleaned up somewhat. Also, it's been inadvertently tested (it seems that
pata_amd Nvidia cable detection is broken in current -git..)
