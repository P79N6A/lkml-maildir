The above message is related to the version of gcc that you get with
your copy of RedHat7. You might just want to use kgcc instead of gcc
to compile your kernel.

Same problem here, albeit not with a DVD drive.
After mounting anything with the loopback device (I know it's not working
that well in 2.4.2) all future mounts of my SCSI writer and SCSI cdrom don't 
even return a prompt. The mount just 'hangs' and the mount process can't be killed 
either.

No, probably not.
I used kgcc to compile the kernel, did not get any of the RH7 gcc warning messages
and still am left with a not-so-stable mount.

Very much appreciated even ;)
