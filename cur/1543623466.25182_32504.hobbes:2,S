The pwcx.o module (binary only) is not necessary for operation of
a Philips webcam. The pwc.o module (GPL) is sufficient if you don't need
640x480 resolution, and high fps rates. Pwcx is a module to decompress
the videostream from the camera for higher framerates since the USB
bandwidth is not enough for 640x480x30fps of raw videodata.
The pwc module is included in the standard linux kernel, pwcx is not, but
the problem is still not in pwcx. The problem is reproducible without
pwcx being loaded.
