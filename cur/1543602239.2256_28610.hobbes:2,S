OK, it's not exactly clear what you are referring to, but:
1) On ext3 the superblock is NEVER marked dirty, because of the journal.
   As long as the journal is running normally, the filesystem will always
   be "clean".
2) There should _not_ be a problem with the needs_recovery flag being set
   from within the kernel.  HOWEVER, attempts to read it from user-space
   may fail because of a disconnect between the buffer cache and the page
   cache.
Now that these issues are in the open (and already being discussed) they
will likely be fixed in a relatively short timeframe.
Cheers, Andreas
