Hello!
I wanted to have 'cprofile=a_profile" specified to my init
system. Now after some hours of debugging I see that
everything that is in the form of
      bla=blub
is eaten by the kernel and _not_ given to init.
Is that how it should be or is that a bug?
If it's how it should be, I'll switch to "cprofile:a_profile"
or will Linux eat that, too?
The most mysterious thing (for me) is that /proc/cmdline
contains that stuff again.
Nico, somehow confused
