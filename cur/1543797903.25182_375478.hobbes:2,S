Both at the time of loading a module and while
unloading a 
module module_mutex is acquired. In the first place we
wer
e not planning to take the spinlock at all. But saw
that r
esolve_symbol does that and hence wasn't sure whether 
the
lock should be acquired.

We will send an updated patch with the modifications.
