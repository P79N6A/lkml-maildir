Hello,
I tried the recent 2.6.12-rc1-bk5 snapshot from kernel.org.
When I want to boot my x86_64 system only a green line appears on screen.
The config is the same as in 2.6.12-rc1-bk4 which works flawlessly on my
system.
I only saw the message that CPU0 and CPU1 where initialized. And then
there was
Brinnging up CPUs and it stopped.
Its an Intel Pentium4 640 with (EMT64,HT,EIST,CIE enabled).
The graphic card is an Nvidia 6600GT PCIe device.
Thanks
Best regards
