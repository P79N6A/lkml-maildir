It would be nice if the jfs fsim linked against libjfs, rather than
exec()ing mkfs & friends.
(mkfs should be a frontend of libjfs)
Notice you have no error handling, etc. now?   Also, the "total system"
seems more complicated now.  (For example: how are you going to
interface the resizer, so you can find out the min/max sizes, etc?)
Also, while I'm at it: you didn't like my idea for interfacing
the parted exception system with evms properly?  I even wrote the code
for you (without testing it)... I didn't see a reply to my mail...
you(s) didn't like it?
BTW: what do you think of how libparted interfaces with libreiserfs?
There has been a lot of work, and it has all been merged properly now.
I think EVMS should do something similar.  Have a look in
libparted/fs_reiserfs.
