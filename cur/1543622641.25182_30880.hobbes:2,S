Subject: tmpfs file permissions in 2.4.19-pre1-ac1

I've noticed some strangeness with (at least) file permissions on a
tmpfs file system. I can't change the permissions of files I own (or,
as root, of any file) on the tmpfs.
This problem does not occur with  2.4.19pre1 or 2.4.18-rc2-ac2 (which
I can test easily).
