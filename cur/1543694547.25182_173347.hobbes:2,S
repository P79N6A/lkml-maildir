hi,
this note will probably not fullfill the needs of a "bug filing", but at 
least i'd like to say there "is something with the 3c59x driver". since 
i've seen several other oddities with this driver on this list in the 
last time, here it comes:
i have a 3c905C-TX ("Vortex") in my ppc32 box, working fine under 
2.4.22. with 2.6.0-test7 the 3c59x.ko module get loaded, but then the 
machine just freezes. this is the behaviour during the standard booting 
process. upon booting with "init=/bin/bash" i am able to do "modprobe 
3c59x". the card gets loaded. i can assign an ip adress to the card, ok. 
but after a couple of minutes or at least upon unloading the driver, the 
machine just freezes. there is *no* oops shown, nothing in the logs, 
SYS-REQ is not working, the machine just halts.
yes, this is quite odd, reproducible perhaps only here@home, another 
3c59x card is working fine with 2.6.0-test7 under ia32 in the next room.
if this helps: gcc is 3.3.2, Debian/unstable, binutils 2.14.90.0.6, 
compiled under 2.4.22.
