Yes, that's pretty much what I meant. ACPI has ~5 people actively
working on it, some of them probably full-time. That's a lot of
manpower, compared to APM.
And ACPI is in pretty good state, btw, unless you want
suspend-to-RAM. Unfortunately you want suspend-to-RAM.

device_suspend() will propagate all the way to alsa.
