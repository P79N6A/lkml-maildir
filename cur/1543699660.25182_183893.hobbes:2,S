You have a few options:
1) Install on another drive, get latest kernel.org kernel, add
libata support to it. Recompile it, install it, run it.
Copy system to SATA drive. Use it.
2) Install on another drive, get latest Fedora Core 1 kernel,
recompile it after disabling ntpl support in it. Install and run
kernel.Copy system to SATA drive. Use it.
3) Install something else (For instance Fedora Core 1) that has
native support for that controller.
"Another drive" means "another machine" btw. One that is supported.
