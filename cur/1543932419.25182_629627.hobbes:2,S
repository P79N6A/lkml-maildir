Yes it can happens, because an active sniffer makes the stack using more
  cpu cycles (timestamping for example).
So you see outgoing SYN packets, but no SYN replies coming from the remote 
peer ?  (you mention ACKS, but the first packet received from the remote
  peer should be a SYN+ACK),
client->server   SYN
server->client   SYN+ACK
client->server   ACK

CC to netdev where linux network guys might have an idea.
When the problem comes, instead of restarting the application, please take a 
tcpdump of say 10.000 packets.
Then turn off tcp_sack and take a 2nd tcpdump sample, and make both samples 
available to us.
If turning off tcp_sack makes the problem go away, why dont you turn it off 
all the time ?
