Hi Andrew,
	I am attaching the second one, just to make sure you and I have the same one.
If this is different than what you are having let me know.
By the way I am testing on IA64 box, with 2.6.9-rc3 + just bk-driver-core.patch from 
your 2.6.9-rc3-mm2-broken-out.tar.
I had to go for just above as I was seeing some out of memory messages on my IA64 box
with complete rc3-mm2 patch.
thanks,
Anil
