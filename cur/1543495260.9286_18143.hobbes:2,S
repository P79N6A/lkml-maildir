Okay, I will try and check the mailing list today.  As for my mail, please feel
free to quote it.  It is our internal plan, and it has not changed.  We are
still working towards an SDK which will allow kernel developers to write drivers
themselves.  Realistically, this is probably 6-9 months away.  This is because
we are working on a new driver architecture which is truly OS independent, and
that has no x86 dependencies.  Once that is complete then we can finalize the
SDK/DDK (Software Development Kit / Driver Development Kit).
I am currently working on an agreement (exactly like Adaptec's) which will allow
us to publish our specs.  Starting with the Ensoniq chips, and followed by
EMU10K1.  The draft of the agreement is in legal, and I expect it to take a
month or so before it is finalized.  Once the agreement is finalized we will
probably be able to have a chip spec available shortly there after.
Thanks for the heads up.  I have included the reflector so that they can see
both my original message and the follow up.
Jake
