I see NAPI poll routine might be called with interrupt disabled.
Many (all?) NAPI drivers call netif_receive_skb() from its poll
routine (as described in NAPI-HOWTO.txt), but I thought
netif_receive_skb() cannot be called from irq context or irq disabled.
So it seems the problem is not solved completely.  Or am I missing
something?
