I disagree.  It should create it in directory d, even though that is
the mount point.
A union mount should include files from another directory, but writes
should go to the actual named directory.

Union mounts should be read only.
If read-write union mounts are needed, I don't think that we should
implement them significantly differently to the way they work in BSD.
