I originally had milli but changed to micro to conform with
power_supply.h (as our PMIC uses this interface to export it input
supplies to userspace).

In general it's up to the system hardware designer to ensure each
regulator can supply all the consumers on the domain - hence we don't
have power budgeting in software atm. However, I don't think it would be
too difficult to add in the future.
I'll also add support for a regulator that will do both voltage and
current (although I'm not aware of any in the market atm).

Agreed.

Ok, total_ sounds good.
