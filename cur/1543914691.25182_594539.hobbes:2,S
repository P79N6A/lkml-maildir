The em28xx/xc3028 is in fact not too complex. Just for sake of
demonstration, some time back i had posted a dummy driver how it can be
done in a nice and clean way as an example.
The patch assumes some additional standards, you can ignore them. But
you get the general idea from in there.

You can read this post also for some additional information.

Use the ideas as you deem fit. ;-)
