Well, to keep the patch descriptions simple, how about I split the
two changes into two patches. First one masquerades ->si_pid with
task_pid_nr_ns() and second one uses task_tgid_nr_ns(). They
do look like unrelated changes.

| Again, I don't know.
| 
| But. Let's suppose we have the user-space application which
| uses .si_pid to figure out which thread hits SIGPIPE. Yes,
| this is ugly because the signal is thread-specific, but this
| works until this patch.
I have highlighted this and the the reparent-thread behavior
changes in the patch description.
| 
| Actually, I don't understand most of (all?) users of
| send_signal(SIGXXX, current, 0), SEND_SIG_PRIV looks more
| logical to me. Or, _perhaps_, we need yet another SEND_SIG_SELF
| which sets .si_pid = task_pid_vnr(target).
Ok. We have to change the __si_special() indirection or how about
removing it altogether and change uses of __si_special() to one of:
	{ SEND_SIG_NOINFO, SEND_SIG_PRIV, SEND_SIG_SELF, &info }
It would add a condition check in places like:
	disassociate_ctty(): kill_pgrp(old_pgrp, SIGHUP, on_exit);
but there aren't too many of those.
