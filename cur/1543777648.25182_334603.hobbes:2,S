Hope Mark could take care this change. I have no
sandpoint board at hand:-)
I removed RS_TABLE_SIZE on my target successfully
and happened to found that there was other file like
../syslib/gen550_dbg.c required SERIAL_PORT_DFNS 
as well which could use for KGDB or sth.

It has implemented on my target:-)
Still one puzzle related serial port. That's interrupt
itself. I enabled two serial ports attached two 
different interrupt levels like 9/10 with disable 
interrupt shared. How come only one appeared 
in /proc/interrupts? What could be on your platform
or they should be?
Thanks a lot,
Sam
