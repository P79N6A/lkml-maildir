I see that we are not getting a NAK when querying ID but getting it while
setting LEDs (or even writing to the control register later). It seems
like controller's timeout is longer than our internal one so we getting
timeout signal from keyboard (which we convert to a NAK) too late.
I wonder if changing timeout in atkbd_sendbyte to 400 or 500 ms will
cure the problem.
