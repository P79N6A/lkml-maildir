I do not want to enter in this flamewar, but the current driver i'm working
on (marvell libertas chipset) need management frames in software. But to
reduce cost, i think that lower chipset try to put the most in the host and
not in the chipset. Marvell build the chipset around a ARM cpu so i think one
day i can do it in hardware but for now i need to choose a ieee802.11 stack.
I've began to used the in kernel solution with my own functions to
send and received this frame. But i hope we will find a technical solution
that please everyone. I'll try to see if the softmac layer written for
broadcom driver can be used for my project.
