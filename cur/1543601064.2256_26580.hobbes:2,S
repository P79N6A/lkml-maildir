Subject: increasing HZ in Linux kernel

Hello,
I want to increase the frequency of the clock interrupt up
to ~10000 to run some experiments.
In the kernel I'm using (2.4.2-2) I've noticed that
if you increase HZ above 1536 you get a conflict with
.../include/linux/timex.h:75-77
and if you add some lines there, you get a problem with
.../include/net/tcp.h:377
when HZ is above 4096.
Is there an easy way to increase clock interrupt freq, or
do I have to mess with the whole kernel ?
Thanks in advance.
Antonios
