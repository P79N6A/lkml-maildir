As we already say in various messages the percpu counters in here
look rather fishy.  I'd recomment to take a look at the per-cpu
superblock counters in XFS as they've been debugged quite well
now and could probably be lifted into a generic library for this
kind of think.  The code is mostly in fs/xfs/xfs_mount.c can
can be spotted by beeing under #ifdef HAVE_PERCPU_SB.
It also handles cases like hotplug cpu nicely that this code
seems to work around by always iterating over all possible cpus
which might not be nice on a dual core laptop with a distro kernel
that also has to support big iron.
