That doesn't help boot-time allocations that go into ->zone_mem_map
and various other places, but it certainly helps runtime space
overhead on machines that have enough ZONE_NORMAL left to boot.
... and I don't believe it's in the kernel yet.

Actually, I made a patch to eliminate ->virtual, another to eliminate
->zone, and another to eliminate ->wait. I believe they can be found in
revised forms in the latest -rmap patch, and the reduction in space
overhead is available for all machines, not just i386 machines where
there's so much physical memory the kernel can't use direct-mapped
virtual-to-physical translations for the kernel virtual address space.
I will take this as further prompting to push these things to mainline
and at long last kill the multiplicative hash in the waitqueue table.
Pagetables in highmem sound good for mainline too.
Cheers,
Bill
P.S.: ->zone came back as an unsigned char because putting it into the
->flags field looked ugly, but it still beats the heck out of a full word.
