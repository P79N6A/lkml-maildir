I think what might be happening is that pdflush writes them out fine,
however we don't trap writes by the application _during_ that writeout.
These corruptions look exactly as if:
1) pdflush begins writeback of page X
2) page goes to disk
3) application writes a chunk to the page
4) pdflush et al. think the page is clean, so it gets tossed, losing
   the writes done in #3
So there's a missing PTE change in there, so that we never get proper
re-dirtying of the page if the application tries to write to the page
during the writeback.
It's something that will only occur with writeback and MAP_SHARED
writable access to the file pages.  That's why we never see this
with normal filesystem writes, since those explicitly manage the
page dirty state.
I think the dirty balancing logic etc. isn't where the problems are,
to me it's a PTE state update issue for sure.
