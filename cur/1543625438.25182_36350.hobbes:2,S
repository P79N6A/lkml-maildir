Subject: smbfs font corruption in 2.5.7

It appears there were some changes made during 2.5.6 to allow for smbfs unicode
support. The problem appears any time I mount an smb filesystem, whether in X or
at VGA framebuffer console. File and directory names show up in a language I
don't speak. Is there some setting I should change to support unicode now, or is
this a known problem. I haven't seen this reported yet, so...
Thanks in advance,
David Shepard
