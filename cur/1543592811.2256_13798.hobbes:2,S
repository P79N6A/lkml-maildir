if the hardware provides no way to get some accurate estimation of current
time, then there is no way to solve this problem in a generic way.
Typically there are some cycle-accuracy counters in the CPU (ideal
situation), or sometimes there is a counter in some external device (eg.
the i8254 timer counter), but access to these tend to be slow and
typically they are quite coarse as well.
