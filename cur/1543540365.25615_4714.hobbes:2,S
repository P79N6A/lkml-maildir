How much you get, depends on how much the actual drive saves. Still, you
lose performance, you possibly lose the settings, that's on the negative
side. I'm aware of these implications, a good friend of mine has written
his diploma thesis in electrical engineering on exactly this topic,
namely "Algorithmen für den leistungsarmen Betrieb mobiler Festplatten"
(German-language, translates to 'algorithms for the low-power operation of
mobile hard disk drives'). Contact me in private mail if you need
more information. 
He collected some information from manufacturers that I'm working up
here: (quoting from 
manuf.+model  IBM DARA Hitachi    Fujitsu  Seagate Ma-  Maxtor
cont'd        225000   DK22AA     2064AT   rathon 2250  251010A 
power (W)
active          2.6    2.22        2.15    2.50         1.83
idle    2.0/1.3/0.85   1.7/0.8     0.95    1.20         0.90
standby         0.25   0.25        0.35    0.30         0.20
sleep           0.1    0.125       0.13    0.10         0.10
So, effectively, you gain about 100..200 mW by putting a drive from
standby to sleep, while you gain roughly 1000 mW from idle to standby
after gaining 0.5 .. 1.5 W from active to idle. (depends on the usage
pattern). OTOH, if you're talking about power, the more interesting
thing is the energy (integral t0...t1 P(t) dt), and waking up
electronics and spinning up the drive costs additional energy, even if
it's only for the delay until the request is satisfied. If waking up
from sleep costs additional seconds, that's going to cost battery life,
to put it popularly.

The error message is natural, a drive put to sleep is put there
permanently, since the drive is supposed to power down its interface
electronics as well.

Since SCSI drives are only manually powered down, the Kernel is fine in
this respect, although it leaves room for feature requests, admittedly
:-)
