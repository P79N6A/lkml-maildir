tmpfs will not help you here. Yes, it can be swapped, but just like
with ramfs you first need to *unpack* the cpio archive before you can
even start the "swapon /dev/hda2" command on it.
Same with initrd, btw. If the compressed initrd image, plus the
uncompressed image, plus the kernel size are larger than the memory
size, the system will not boot.
