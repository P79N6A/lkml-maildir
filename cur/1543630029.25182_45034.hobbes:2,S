Some personal thoughts from a Linux user.  Seems like several possibilities
for Eric's attitude...
    1. waiting for people to see the need for CML2
    2. waiting for people who said they could do it better to put up
    3. totally disgusted by the attitude and behavior on the list
    4. all of the above
I never got CML2 to work correctly and found Eric to act helpful but to not
really help.  It surprised me that he knew little about how people (me)
actually used kernel config and build scripts.
Free software has to attract people...developers can't force it.  CML2
required powerful, knowledgeable kernel developers to change and they didn't
want to.
