Hi Ingo,
I'm digging around trying to work out how the handover from the 
boot-time allocator to the real memory management works. 
I'm missing something important though:  bootmem.c:free_all_bootmem() 
seems to end up just putting all low memory on the freelists.  How does 
this not put the kernel text+data pages on the freelists?  Also, 
presumably things allocated in the bootmem allocator remain allocated 
for the life of the running kernel?
I'm having a problem in my Xen kernel, in which free_init_pages() ends 
up getting a bad_page() warning because pfn 1024 has the PG_buddy bit 
set on it, which was unexpected (this page ends up being in the middle 
of the initdata section).  Page 1024 gets PF_buddy set by 
free_all_bootmem_core(), and it becomes an order 10 page.
I presume this is broken because free_all_bootmem_core() shouldn't be 
putting the kernel text+data into the freelists, but I don't see how 
this is prevented in the normal i386 case.  I'm guessing it's done by 
something like reserve_bootmem(), but I don't see such a call which 
would reserve the kernel itself.
What am I missing?
Thanks,
    J
