Will fix.
BTW I was planning to make LOCAL_APIC unconditional on i386 too like on x86-64.
There is basically no reason ever to disable it, and the bug work around
for buggy BIOS one can be done at runtime. Overall the #ifdef / compile breakage
ratio vs saved code on disabled APIC code is definitely unbalanced.
