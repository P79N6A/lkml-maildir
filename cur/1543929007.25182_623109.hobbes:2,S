btw., this is the list of patches i've picked up for testing:
modules-include-sectionsh-to-avoid-defining-linker-variables.patch
modules-handle-symbols-that-have-a-zero-value.patch
modules-fold-percpu_modcopy-into-modulec-and-get-rid-of-the-macro-from-hell.patch
percpu1-percpu-use-a-kconfig-variable-to-signal-arch-specific-percpu-setup.patch
percpu1-percpu-move-arch-xx-per-cpu-xx-definitions-into-linux-percpu-h.patch
percpu1-percpu-make-the-asm-generic-percpu-h-more-generic-.patch
percpu1-x86-32-use-generic-percpu-h.patch
percpu1-x86-64-use-generic-percpu.patch
percpu1-s390-use-generic-percpu.patch
percpu1-powerpc-use-generic-per-cpu.patch
percpu1-sparc64-use-generic-percpu.patch
percpu1-ia64-use-generic-percpu.patch
percpu1-x86-unify-percpu-h.patch
percpu2-percpu-infrastructure-to-rebase-the-per-cpu-area-to-0ul.patch
percpu2-x86-64-declare-pda-as-per-cpu-data-thereby-moving-it-into-the-cpu-area.patch
percpu2-x86-64-make-the-x86-32-percpu-operations-usable-on-x86-64.patch
the first 3 are from -mm, the rest from lkml. This series applied 
cleanly without any rejects but i still got the spontaneous reboot 
during bootup on UP 32-bit x86.
So either i'm still missing some essential patch, or this tree somehow 
triggers the problem more likely than in -mm. I've bisected it down to:
 percpu1-percpu-move-arch-xx-per-cpu-xx-definitions-into-linux-percpu-h.patch
that patch looks harmless though. Anyway, we can certainly revisit this 
issue after you get back on Dec 13th.
