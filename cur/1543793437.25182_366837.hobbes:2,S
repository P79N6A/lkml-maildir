I suppose we are here discussing an external project where you want to
build a single module.
kbuild (and the kbuild syntax) is optimized for the pattern seen most
often in the kernel. And only in very rare cases we have a module split
over more than one directory. In the nomal cases everything are kept
together.
fs/xfs is one example where we do split up the source code in several dirs.
So there are only two possibilities:
1) Do like the rest of the kernel and keep the files in one dir
2) Specify all .o files in the top-level kbuild (Makefile) file.
Like this:
obj-m := module.o
module-y := subdir1/foo.o
module-y += subdir1/bar.o
module-y += subdir2/fooo.o
module-y += subdir2/baro.o
