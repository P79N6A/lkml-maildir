Yasunori-san,
Thank-you for updating your patch.
However I am still puzzled by one detail.
Your latest patchset removes the defines:
-#define MAX_PXM_DOMAINS	256	/* 1 byte and no promises about values */
and:
-#define MAX_PXM_DOMAINS (256)
but continues to have code using MAX_PXM_DOMAINS.  I am unable
to compile ia64 with it now, for lack of this define.
