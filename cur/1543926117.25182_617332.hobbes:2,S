I've been wanting to send this as a proper patch request email, but I 
just hadn't found the time to do it, and then our mail server just went 
berserk and I lost 5 days of LKML :P
I think the patch is ok as it is, but a nice message explaining what it 
does and why would be nice for the changelog. So, I'll post a new 
message with a nice description for inclusion in -mm today.
Sorry for the delay,
