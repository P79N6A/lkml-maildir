There is also a different bug in Linux that makes the application not notice
errors. When it does a close() and an error occurs while flushing buffered
data and doing the FIN handshake it is not returned by close() (no matter
if linger time hits or not). Most transaction applications like SMTP fortunately 
use an own ACKing protocol, which works around that.
