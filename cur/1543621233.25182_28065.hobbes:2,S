I bet you have CONFIG_SMP or CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC enabled. In that
case the hangs on the Inspiron are expected: it's BIOS is buggy.
A quick fix is to disable those two options. The proper fix is to
complain to Dell and tell them to fix their damn BIOS, then get a
2.4.18-pre or -rc kernel, and apply these patches
patch-boot-time-ioremap
patch-early-dmi-scan
patch-dmi-apic-fixups
