From devices.txt:
 30 char        iBCS-2 compatibility devices
                  0 = /dev/socksys      Socket access
                  1 = /dev/spx          SVR3 local X interface
                  2 = /dev/inet/arp     Network access
                  2 = /dev/inet/icmp    Network access
                  2 = /dev/inet/ip      Network access
                  2 = /dev/inet/udp     Network access
                  2 = /dev/inet/tcp     Network access
                Additionally, iBCS-2 requires /dev/nfsd to be a link
                to /dev/socksys, and /dev/X0R to be a link to
                /dev/null.
You probably have some application trying to access this device(s).  Do you?

It should not have nothing to do with the crash, did you get any oops or similar?

Suggest you to upgrade to a newer kernel.
