I would argue it is the right approach.  It lets the kernel system call 
entry dispatch directly to the system call for the "new" case, and to a 
compatibility thunk for the "old" case.  It has the following desirable 
properties:
- No overhead for the "new" case.
- Minimal overhead for the "old" case.
- Easily dealt with by tools like strace that examine system calls.
