And in fact, people are using it. Like I said earlier, I used to work
in StorageTek R&D, and we started using it. In fact the hardware people
started first, so the displays on our VSM arrays (Terabyte sized RAID
arrays) would use the kB = 1000byte whereas our reports would use 
kB=1024byte. Big confusion. 
AFAIR, the decision made to go with the IEC standard was primarily
because it was a standard.
