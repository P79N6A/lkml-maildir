Ouch! You've got a number of false positives here. Some that struck
me:
> CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_SUSPEND_BOUNCE: arch/i386/kernel/apm.c
> CONFIG_DEVFS_TTY_COMPAT: Documentation/filesystems/devfs/ChangeLog
> CONFIG_DEVFS_BOOT_OPTIONS: Documentation/filesystems/devfs/ChangeLog
> CONFIG_DEVFS_DISABLE_OLD_NAMES: Documentation/filesystems/devfs/ChangeLog
> CONFIG_DEVFS_DISABLE_OLD_TTY_NAMES: Documentation/filesystems/devfs/ChangeLog
> CONFIG_DEVFS_ONLY: Documentation/filesystems/devfs/ChangeLog
> CONFIG_DEVFS: Documentation/filesystems/devfs/ChangeLog
These are options that used to be used, and now only reside in
documentation, ChangeLogs or in comments. These should not be removed
from the tree, irrespective of whether they cause your broken symbol
code to detect them.
