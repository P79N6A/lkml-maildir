It has three modes, I'll try to explain this in more detail in my next patch version.

I'll document the led trigger extension in more detail in the next
version of the "[PATCH 2/3] leds-clevo-mail: hw accelerated LED blink extension",
in drivers/leds/Kconfig.

I'll delete these #defines.

I'll use KBUILD_MODNAME instead.

I'll delete NO_RESOURCES.

I'll replace MODULE_FNAME with KBUILD_MODNAME. Is this what you mean?

OK, I'll replace.

Here I have the problem that the different laptop models have
different colors of mail LED. So I left out the color and
introduced the type of the LED which is "mail". I'll try to
document this in Documents/leds-class.txt

I'll change this to what you proposed.

I'll remove the braces for the on-line expression.

I'll use KBUILD_MODNAME instead.
