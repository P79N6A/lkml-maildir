Repeating my earlier reply to a similar question...
On 2.4 it certainly would be a problem (hang with others OOM-killed).
On 2.6 it shouldn't be a problem: the swapoff may fail upfront if
there's way too little memory, or it may get itself OOM-killed if
it runs out on the way, but it ought not to upset other tasks.
But of course, Pavel is right that it does nothing for file backed.
