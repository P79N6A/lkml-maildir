I will ask you just one question: as a user, why did you want to
upgrade your kernel?
On a server you want stability. So you don't upgrade. On a desktop,
there are probably a bunch of out of kernel modules that will need
upgrading with each new kernel modules. Just on the laptop I am using
right now, I will have to upgrade the vmware bridge, nvidia driver,
madwifi wireless driver, etc. And that's normal. The new development
model didn't change that.
I avoid touching my kernel on boxes I do real work with. I do build a
new kernel for test purposes and to give feedback if there's an issue.
But most of the time I skip 2-3 versions before finding a very
compelling reason to upgrade. And I stick with my distribution kernel
as much as I can.
As for kernel/drivers developers, it's another story.
If it ain't broken, don't fix it.
