I've been using the USB and the SCSI versions of OnStream tapes with

If you want a really helpful advice:
Use the osst driver and the use it with ide-scsi.
Report problems to the osst mailing list. 
So far, I'm not aware of anybody we failed to help.

I'm afraid I do not know too much about the ide-tape support for DI-30.
Gadi Oxman is the author of it (has been paid by OnStream to write it, BTW),
but he may be short on time at the moment to help you with the problem.

I don't know whether this is a hard- or a software problem in your case.

I have a completely different impression. Otherwise neither the DI-30 would
be supported by ide-tape, nor would there be the osst driver, supporting
SC-x0, DI-30 (over ide-scsi) and USB30 (usb-storage in 2.4 w/ Freecom
support).
