How can we pass interpretter state? I do not think we do this kind of
passing.
If it was enough to pass some static area, we could just mark it
nosave...
Len: Is ACPI AML permitted to allocate memory (like in ACPI_ALLOC or
something)? Could we easily identify BIOS data so we could mark them
nosave?
