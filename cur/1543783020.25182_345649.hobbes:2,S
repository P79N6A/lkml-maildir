Have you looked at the implementations for swiotlb_sync_single_for_cpu
and swiotlb_sync_single_for_device?  Those are already identical.
I'm just following the existing style/practice in that file.  I could
do an additional patch to rectify the replication in those functions
if you'd like?
Who is responsible for the swiotlb code?
John
