Well, OK.  But Paul really hates #ifdefs in kernel/cpusets.c.  He's
asked me to remove them before, so I avoided them here.  Cpusets really
should use only nodes with memory--i.e., the N_HIGH_MEMORY state.

So far.  I'm replacing other usage of node_online_map with the
N_HIGH_MEMORY mask, as we discussed.  I should have that patch ready to
post tomorrow.

But, the mask--the N_HIGH_MEMORY array element, that is--is there for
both NUMA and !NUMA [== N_NORMAL_MEMORY for !CONFIG_HIGHMEM].  We just
don't initialize it for the !NUMA case, currently.

That's what the patch I posted today [option 2] does--statically
initializes the N_*_MEMORY and N_CPU masks to indicate that node 0
exists.  Serge and Dhaval have tested it on their platform and it solves
the cpuset mount problem.
