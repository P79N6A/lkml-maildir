I thought we fixed that long time ago?!?!
I am heading for vacation for 20 days without Internet (real vacation :-))
and have properly forget most about Linux and everything about this
issue when I return.
In the unlikely event that I recall it I will take a look when I'm back.
By the way - kbuild.git is lacking behind on patches.
I have several queded from other peopel and have more in the works myself.
This will not be looked into until I'm back.
