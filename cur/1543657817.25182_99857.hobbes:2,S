Nor would I advocate doing so.  I added two 'constants' I wanted to
be able to test them so I updated Robert's patch...  Two questions
for you.
1. Do you have any comments/suggestsion on the ptg_B0 patch?
2. I have been playing with using user and thread penalties together.
- they often interact badly.  Using just one works very well.  This
can be fixed - but gets messy.  Alternately, I am thinking about 
implementing per user policies.  ie.
	a. govern thread groups
	b. govern all threads, ignoring groups, for a user
	c. govern processes for a user
This can be done cleanly.  Would something along the lines of sys_nice
be the way to implement the kernel side of the user interface to this?
TIA,
Ed Tomlinson
