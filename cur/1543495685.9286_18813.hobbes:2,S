   I have no definitive answer, but I would strongly suspect we cannot
   rely on tick mechanisms with SMP.
Unless Alpha's support different clock rate cpus mixed into a single
machine, you can use something like Ingo's tick calibration code at
boot time to make sure all cpu's have synchronized tick values.
