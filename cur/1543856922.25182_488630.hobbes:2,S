There are times you want to reclaim just part of a zone - specifically
satisfying a high-order allocations. See sitations 1 and 2 from elsewhere
in this thread. On a similar vein, there will be times when you want to
migrate a PFN range for similar reasons.

Because you wanted contiguous blocks of pages.  This is related to anti-frag
because with anti-frag, reclaiming memory or migration memory will free up
contiguous blocks. Without it, you're probably wasting your time.
