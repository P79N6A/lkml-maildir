I previously expressed ( maybe in this thread, I don't remember ) my idea of
not touching ( hacking ) the current scheduler to let it fit to SMP, that IMHO,
has different problems and needs different answers.
Anyway, as I said a couple of messages ago, the solution of this problem could
be to move the moved task in a private ( per CPU ) wakeup list that, when the
idle comes up, it'll be ran.
