   Firstly the DMA mask on x86 can't be below 24bits, we don't support
   allocation from a smaller zone.
Understood.
   Secondly what about PCI for 25-31bits -
   there we do need to force gfp_dma to have any chance of getting the
   right pages
   
Look at what his code does after the GFP_DMA setting, it goes
a non-GFP_DMA setting, and if the 25-31 bits case is not satisfied
it backs down to GFP_DMA.
   Giving the page allocator a mask argument does sound a lot nicer
   
It's pretty simple to implement too since we do have page_to_phys.
