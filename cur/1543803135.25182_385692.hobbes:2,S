There are two drivers, each with it's own features and bugs.
Either the ALSA driver is better in any respect making the OSS driver 
simply obsolete, or there are problems in the ALSA driver that should be 
reported and fixed.
Removing the OSS driver forces users to report the problems with the 
ALSA driver making the latter better for everyone.
