extract from the linux-arm-kernel 'Mailing List Etiquette':
             10. Cross-posting between linux-arm* lists and other lists. [[40]rmk]
                Please do not do this. Subscribers on other lists may not be
                subscribed to the linux-arm lists, so when they try to reply to
                such a message, they will receive a bounce. This is deemed by
                others to be rude behaviour on the part of the person who
                originally cross-posted.

I just think there is no need to warn, even if definitions are sub-optimal.

Probably for dma safety/performance, The PDC buffer start should be aligned to
cache line, and the size be a multiple of cache line size.

For me there is no need to disbable pdc support once working. PDC can be
enabled/disabled in the board setup code. -> simply remove this definition.
