I have a hunch that many drivers will break if you change the semantics of
readX/writeX from in-order to out-of-order - lots of drivers are only
developed & tested on x86, which completely hides the issue...
If you consider the performance cost of in-order readX/writeX to be
significant, then I would suggest adding another group of readX/writeX APIs
that explicitly allow out-of-order PCI access. (__raw_readX/__raw_writeX
seem to offer this already on some platforms...)

Dan
