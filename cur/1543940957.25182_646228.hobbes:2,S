No. 
Another observation, running two instances of while true; do true; done (on
1 dual core cpu) does not break interactivity.
running make clean; make -j2 in kernel tree breaks interactivity terribly.
Looks like disk I/O activity is needed to break interactivity. 
While compiling, I have more than 1GB of RAM free. One friend of mine suggests
that kernel is swapping out binaries which causes non-interactivity. The
swaparea is clean, though. He also reports that the behavior can be seen even
in 2.6.24-rc8.
