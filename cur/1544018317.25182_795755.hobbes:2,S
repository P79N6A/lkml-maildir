Well actually, I don't see the output causing any issues. That's another 
point. Should we work on adding all this complex code for something that 
might not every cause an issues?  I added it because it did cause an issue 
with the irqs off traces, although I'm not sure that is true any 
more either. I just added it to the wakeup tracer just to be consistent.
With the new trace_off switch that disables the ring buffer, and the 
stopping of the swap buffers with the switch off, I do not think that this 
code is even necessary anymore.
I think I'll rip out the code from irqsoff and see if it is still an issue 
there. If not, I think we can get rid of it.
