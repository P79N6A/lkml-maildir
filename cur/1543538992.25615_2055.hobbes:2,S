To assess the performance impact of the LL patch I used the
ISO-standard benchmark of compiling the Linux kernel.
Executive summary: Nil impact.
Methodology:
1: <reboot>
2: Run this:
   #!/bin/zsh
   0 /etc/rc.d/init.d/crond stop
   IN=$(cat /proc/stat)
   echo $IN
   time (make -j3 clean && make -j3 bzImage && make -j3 modules)
   echo $IN
   cat /proc/stat

So this is pretty dull from an LL-patch point of view.
From a wider aspect there are some interesting anomalies.
- Why is the aggregate user time higher when using SMP?
- Ditto the aggregate system time?
- Why only 169% load on SMP?
That may all be due to accounting granularities.  But
- Why only 1.5 times speedup on SMP?
This is with a 20 MByte/sec UDMA66 drive, 256 megs.
