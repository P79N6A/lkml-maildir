But apps shouldn't have to know about the special requirements of laptops.  
I've been playing a little with the idea of creating a special block device 
for laptops that goes between the vfs and the real block device, and adds the 
behaviour of being able to buffer writes in memory.  In all respects it would 
seem to the vfs to be a disk.  So far this is just a thought experiment.

Yes, another person to talk to about this is Jens Axboe who has been doing 
some serious hacking on the block layer.  I thought I'd get the early flush 
patch working well for one disk before generalizing to N ;-)

Exactly.  And in addition, when bdflush does wake up, I try to get kupdate 
out of the way as much as possible, though I've been following the 
traditional recipe and having it submit all buffers past a certain age.  This 
is quite possibily a bad thing to do because it could starve the swapper.  
Ouch.
