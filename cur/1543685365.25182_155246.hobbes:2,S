This patch also solves my problem as reported on Jul. 29th
(Subject: "2.4.22-pre4: devfs on initrd stays busy after pivot_root"
Message-ID: 3F267FD7.4040400@xss.co.at) and in more detail
on July 30th, (Message-ID: 3F2795DE.5020306@xss.co.at)
I just tried it with 2.4.22-rc1, and with this patch I am
able to umount /initrd/dev and /initrd after pivot_root
again!
Don't know yet if it has any ill side effects, though.
HTH
