Your BIOS is reporting the 2nd CPU as disabled, and telling us that it
has LAPIC id 0x81 = 129.  The ACPI table code prints this out and
registers the processor anyway, but that chokes because the LAPIC ID is
way out of bounds.
I'm thinking that ACPI should not register a processor that the BIOS
marked as disabled...
What should you do?  Apparently you've got an HT-enabled platform, BIOS,
and OS, but do not have an HT-enabled processor.  Your choices are to
disable HT in the BIOS SETUP to clean up this message, or plug in an
HT-enabled processor.
cheers,
