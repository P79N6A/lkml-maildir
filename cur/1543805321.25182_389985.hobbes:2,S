Ok.  I think I was thinking of a different case, but if I missed one
this could explain the weirdness I was seeing.
Let me list the cases I know of and see if I hit what
you are thinking of.
fs/nfs/nfs3proc.c:nfs3_proc_create()
For O_EXCL we have arg.verifier = current->pid.
fs/lockd/clntproc.c:nlmclnt_setlockargs()
We have:	lock->oh.len  = sprintf(req->a_owner, "%d@%s",
					current->pid, system_utsname.nodename);
I think this is the fcntl() case.
I would suggest fl_pid might have something to do with it 
but that is part flock based locking.
So I'm not certain I see the part of NFS you are refering to.
