When I suggested ELF for this purpose it was not so much that it was
directly usable.  But rather it was an existing file format that could
do the job, was well understood, and had enough extensibility
through the PT_NOTES segment to handle the weird cases.

Generate it ELF64.  We also have the problem that the kernels virtual
addresses are not used in the core dump either.   Which a post-processing
tool will also have to address as well. 
What I aimed at was a simple picture of memory decorated with the
register state.  We should be able to derive everything beyond that.
And the fact that it is all in user space should make it straight
forward to change if needed.
