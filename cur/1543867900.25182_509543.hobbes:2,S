There is no test or wait of Kicked in considered
for (;;) aio_write() loop.

Could you list other introduced bugs?

I wrote in the vary first mail that the panic is appearing in
random write O_DIRECT aio-stress running. Other aio-stress modes
where tested after patching as well.

Looking closely into sources we can see that
EIOCBQUEUED never may be returned to aio_run_iocb().
include/linux/aio.h says
* If ki_retry returns -EIOCBRETRY ...
Could you point source line which "returns -EIOCBRETRY"?

Yes it does.  It will not return until kiocbSetKicked() is called,  
and that is only called from kick_iocb().

Right, and I said that in the mail you're quoting.

Yes, I understand the bug you're trying to fix.  You're introducing  
other bugs with the patch.  It will not be merged.

What arguments are you running aio-stress with?  -EIOCBQUEUED is only  
used for O_DIRECT, and then only in certain circumstances.
