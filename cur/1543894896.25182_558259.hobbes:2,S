For normal block I/O it's just raw copies over the provided protocol.
But the service exports a service by which raw SCSI commands can be
sent, for things like disk fault probing and stuff like that.  It's
not for block I/O, it's for "all the funny stuff" scsi comands are
used for outside of actual data transfers.
