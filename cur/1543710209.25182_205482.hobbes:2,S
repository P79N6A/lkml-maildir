Running smp 2.4.9 (don't ask) with updated nmi logic on a Dell 650 
(UP P4), I notice that NMI is running at about 1.08 Hz. Per the 
kernel logic, it should be running at HZ (100) Hz.
I'm using NMI_LOCAL_APIC. check_nmi_watchdog() never gets called in 
this mode in an smp kernel, near as I can tell, so nmi_hz never gets 
set to 1.
What's going on? Or does anyone else see it?
