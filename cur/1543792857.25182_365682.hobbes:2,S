   I return up->timer.function to serial8250_timeout in the polling mode
path of serial8250_startup().  The patch only makes use of up->timer
when it's not already being used for polling and will restore it on the
next startup if the UART is switched to polling.  Would you prefer that
I always set up->timer.function to serial8250_timeout on the shutdown
path?  Thanks,
