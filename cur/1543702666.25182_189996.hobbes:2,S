I'm setting it to PSMOUSE_IMEX, that's just below PSMOUSE_SYNAPTICS:
#define PSMOUSE_PS2             1
#define PSMOUSE_PS2PP           2
#define PSMOUSE_PS2TPP          3
#define PSMOUSE_GENPS           4
#define PSMOUSE_IMPS            5
#define PSMOUSE_IMEX            6
#define PSMOUSE_SYNAPTICS       7
That should turn off just synaptics, no? 
Okay, so how to do this properly? Synaptics driver with "mouse
emulation" is not usable (tap-to-click is critical), and I want to be
able to boot 2.4...

When do you have a heart between your knees?
