Hello,
I have released a new version of the perfmon base package.
This release is relative to 2.6.15-rc5-git3.
I have also updated the library, libpfm-3.2, to match the kernel
level changes. 
This new kernel patch includes several important changes:
  - pfm_create_context() interface has changed. The sampling
    buffer format argument is now passed explicitly instead
    of relying on it being contiguous to pfarg_ctx_t.
  - code in perfmon/perfmon.c has been split into 8 
    different files for improved maintainability. Each
    file implements one specific function. Perfmon.c
    remains the core.
  - fixed several important bugs for i386 and x86_64 for
    Intel P4/Xeon (simple counting was returning 0).
  - added support for virtual PMD (read/write)
  - added notion of read-only PMD
  - Split Pentium M/P 6 PMU description in preparation for
    Pentium M LBR support
  - Added support for reference counting on PMU description
    and Sampling buffer modules to avoid panic in case
    module is removed while being used.
  - On i386/X86_64, added code to handle the NMI watchdog
    when it is using the Local APIC. We now use
    reserve_lapic_nmi() and release_lapic_nmi().
  - various other cleanups and bug fixes
You MUST use libpfm-3.2-051215 with this kernel due to
interface change for pfm_create_context().
As usual, you can download the latest packages from the
SourceForge website at:

I will be posting the patches directly to LKML for
review very shortly.
Enjoy,
