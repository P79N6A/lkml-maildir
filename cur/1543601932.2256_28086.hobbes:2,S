This doesn't make sense. Even professional soundcards provide hundreds
of kBytes of buffer space. And even with most cheap PCI cards you
need not wait until the whole buffer is full before start reading
samples. Even with those soundcards the latency is mostly caused
by the digital filters in the codec.
