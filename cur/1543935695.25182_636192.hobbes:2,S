And the way this is done is simply broken.  It means you have to get
rid of things like delayed or unwritten hands beforehand, it'll be
a complete pain for COW or non-block backed filesystems.
The right way to do this is to allow direct I/O from kernel sources
where the filesystem is in-charge of submitting the actual I/O after
the pages are handed to it.  I think Peter Zijlstra has been looking
into something like that for swap over nfs.
