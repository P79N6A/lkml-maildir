No, it's certainly unrelated. In the meantime the problem was also
encountered if the same device was connected via USB.

Since then the oops did never happen under 2.6.18.1 plus this patch and
other ieee1394 updates. I.e. that one was certainly a problem in
2.6.19-rc2. I will continue testing on 2.6.19-rcX.
