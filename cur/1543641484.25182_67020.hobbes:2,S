   David S. Miller tells me here that '2.4.20-pre5 is tons more stable than 
   2.4.19 anyways'
   is this correct?
If you're using the bonding driver, for one this.
It OOPS's in 2.4.19
There are other critical fixes in 2.4.20-preX as well.
Why is this news?  Stop the presses!  2.4.20-preX has more fixes than
2.4.19, how astonishing!
