Moving to newer interfaces implies use of the new ondisk format
for the quota files (exclusively) - I'd imagine that's the main
reason behind providing a choice.  Whether or not that reason is
sufficently compelling though... dunno.  If one wanted to be able
to switch between booting either 2.4 (unpatched) and 2.5+, and
also maintain quota information on filestystems, then the choice
would be useful in that situation.
cheers.
