   I was wondering what the status and possability/opinions of a zero
   copy sendfile routine where.  As I see it, the zero copy sendfile
   could be implemented a couple of ways, but I did not know if this
   was in the works by other groups or if a strategy had been in place
   to implement this feature and not yet done.
It requires many changes to the architecture of the networking,
it is planned for 2.5.x
Later,
