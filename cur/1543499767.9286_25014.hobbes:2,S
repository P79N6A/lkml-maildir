This is actually an old idea. The problem that has never been solved well is
recovery from errors. You lose 1% of your object store. How do you tidy up.
20% of your object store dies in a disk crash, how do you run an fscobject
tool. You can do it, but you end up back with file system complexity and
all the other fs stuff.
Another peril is that external interfaces don't always like replay of events.
Consider for example a checkpoint restore of an object talking down a serial
line to do money transfers
	Please send $1
[CHECKPOINT]
	0000
[CRASH]
	0000 dollars to account 44515167
Getting this sort of stuff right requires a lot of care. 
Another example (and an old real world one) about object persistence and the
fact you can't checkpoint the universe:
	At xx;00,xx:15,xx:30,xx:45 the cable pay per view box wakes up
	and checks if you have enough credit left, if so it deducts credit
	and goes back to sleep. If not it cuts off the film putting up a
	phone for more credit box
At xx:59:58 the user turns the box off for four seconds, at xx:14:58 the user
turns the box off for four seconds...
You still end up with a lot of your objects having checkpoint/restart aware
methods.
Moving just some objects between systems is fun too. You then get into cluster
checkpointing, which is a field that requires you wear a pointy hat, have
a beard and work for SGI or Digital.

Their numbers are for a microkernelish core. They are still very good, but
that includes basically no drivers, no network stack, no graphics and apparently
no real checkpoint/restart in the face of corruption. I may be wrong on the
last item.

That nature of I/O is no different. If you always do large sequential
block writes tell me how it will outperform a conventional OS if only
a small number of changes in a small number of objects occur.

You can checkpoint Linux and suspend[1]. Right now it is a 'destructive' suspend
in the sense that it pushes a lot of stuff out of memory but the mechanism
is valid for checkpointing too.  Doing it right requires a copy-on-write
fs, just like the object store happens to require copy on write semantics
for checkpointing.
[1] See 2.3.6ac1 which has the swsuspend patch in it, cleaned up a little
Object stores are great models for some applications, thats why libraries
for doing persistent object stores in application space exist (eg texas)
Another way to look at this
		File System			Object Store
Index		Inode Number			Object ID
Update		Look in directory		Look in an object
		Find item			Find item location
		Write(maybe COW)		Write(maybe COW)
Page In		Look in directory		Look in an object
		Find item			Find item location
		Write(maybe COW)		Write(maybe COW)
Granularity	User controlled			Enforced by OS
So if I promise to call my inodes object ids, call the directory structure
"objects" and I have a checkpointing scheme  - what is the great new concept.

Some thoughts 
o	I don't think the object model is the good stuff
o	The security model is very very interesting indeed. 
o	They are making it hard to help them however.
(quote from their mailing list)
	The EROS license requires that it be possible for me or my designates 
	to do proprietary releases. If the drivers could be done outside the 
	kernel this would not be an issue, but in this version of the system 
Thats unfortunately going to make it harder to help them, both because a lot
of people may find the idea that he's going to do closed versions of their
work, and also because it makes it hard to share device drivers with their
modified MPL licensed code until they have drivers running outside of kernel
space (which is on their list)
