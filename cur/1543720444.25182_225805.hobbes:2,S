Wrong.
Pleas fix jffs2 to use the proper "get_unaligned()"/"put_unaligned()"  
instead.
Emulating unaligned accesses with traps (even even the architecture
supports it, which isn't universally true) is _stupid_ when we have 
perfectly well-defined macros for them that do it faster and are 
_designed_ for this.
On architectures where it doesn't matter, the macros just do the access, 
so it's not like you're slowing anything down.
