All throughout development, before Justin had written a single line of 
code, he was told to do things via Device Mapper.  All he had to do was 
open his ears, and no resource waste would have occurred.

Strongly disagree.
Linux should export the [non-RAID] hardware capabilities, nothing more.
We don't shim for not-in-tree binary-only drivers.  A user continues to 
be free to simply -not use- aic79xx, regardless of this design decision. 
  SATA controllers come with all sorts of class codes:  RAID (host/fake 
raid), SCSI (fake RAID/fake scsi), IDE, Serial ATA.
We ignore that, and just export the hardware.  The class code is only a 
hint that dmraid should be loaded on top of the low-level driver.

We don't do it "the Linux way" just for NIH's sake.  There are strong 
reasons why we want cross-vendor solutions.  There are strong reasons 
why we don't want every driver to embed a software RAID engine inside 
it.  And there are strong reasons (some legal, not technical) why its 
best to ignore binary-only, out-of-tree drivers.
