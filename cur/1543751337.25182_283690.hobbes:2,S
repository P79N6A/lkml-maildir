I would think that having clear_page avoid loading cache
lines from memory should be general improvement.
Bypassing the cache may be beneficial for clear_page in general but I
would like to test that first.
If this is not a win then it may be better to implement the bypassing the
cache through a zero driver.

Right. I also thought about that. I will likely offer the clear_page patch
as an optional component in V4. Being able to specify an order with
clear_page also helps in other situations like clearing huge pages.
