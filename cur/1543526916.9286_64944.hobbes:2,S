Unfortunately I think that Alan is right on this one.

Suggestion: 
The BSD generic tunneling code. You have two devices and a process - a character
device, a network device and a process to handle the data. Traffic for the
network device gets copied to the chracter and read from there by the process
which does whatever is necessary, in your case rewrite the encaps and write to
the DSL. Stuff coming from the DSL is reparsed and written to the char device.
Than the char device injects it via its network counterpart into the networking
layer.
Known to work ;-)
Cheers ;-)
