Perhaps, then, we need to redesign the driver interface - whether we like it or
not is irrelevant.
Currently, module loading is user-initated. Modules are loaded and hardware 
probed for when a userspace program attempts to use a device.
I suggest that we should do this the other way round - hardware-initiated. 
Rather than waiting for a user to access the device, we scan the busses and 
load drivers for all the hardware we find attached.
In the kernel, we keep a mapping for each bus type from vendor/device ID (or 
their equivalent) to the driver routine which can handle those devices - 
much like CardBus and PCMCIA already does. 
This only needs to be done for drivers which are actually loaded - then when 
we discover a device which isn't in this list, we can use kmod to request a 
driver for it - request_module("pci_device_102b_1100") etc. 
Adding MODULE_SUPPORTED_HARDWARE entries to signify which devices are handled
by each driver module is a fairly simple task while will keep depmod/modprobe 
happy.
The only drawback I see with this is that it doesn't allow you to save kernel 
memory by unloading drivers while they're not being used. I'm sure if I spent 
more than five minutes thinking about it, I'd be able to sort that out too, 
though.
