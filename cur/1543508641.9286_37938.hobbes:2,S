Subject: IPv6 as a module?

IS IPv6 usable as a module or not? The net/Config.in file claims it isn't,
but still has the option as a tristate (there's a bool-variant, but that
one's commented out. STRANGE!)
Apart from this, and some problems with fs/partitions, I've rewritten all
the config-menus for all platforms. A patch will come soon...
