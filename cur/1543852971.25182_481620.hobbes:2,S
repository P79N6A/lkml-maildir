In which case isn't the real regression that it does IO?
Nevertheless, I give you two options:
1. Abort all IO do inserted floppy disk after resume.
2. Corrupt replaced floppy disk after resume.
You have to pick one and exactly one.  Which is inherently less risky to
the end user?
(I'm not saying that I can change the behaviour; I'm merely trying to
point out that you're arguing for an inherently dangerous behaviour.)
