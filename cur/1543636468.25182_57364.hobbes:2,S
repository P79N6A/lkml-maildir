I have tried both methods and they work. I would of course like to use the
most real-time efficient and "Kernel standard" methods. Looking into the
code code of netif_rx_ni seems to be logically the most correct way since it
will trigger do_softirq directly after the call to netif_rx.

Actually he should call netif_rx_ni() instead of netif_rx().
_ni stands for non-interrupt context.
