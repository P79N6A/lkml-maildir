I only confirmed that it works on current BSD's, not that it used to
work that way on 4.3BSD (although that was my impression.)
Anyhow, I don't really mind the 111 mode, the point was to show shell

is the "more useful case" that somehow got stripped off in the replies,
namely setuid and setgid scripts.
