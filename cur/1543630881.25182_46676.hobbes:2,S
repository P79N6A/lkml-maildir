I included support for PDC202xx and have a PDC20268 (Promise Ultra100
TX2).  Isn't that enough? hdparm claims the cd and dvd are using
dma. The configuration is exactly the same with both kernels.
However, I had to modify pdc202xx.c to make it use udma3 and higher
for the disk. It failed to set hwif->udma_four so other parts of the
ide driver refused to even try the fast modes. I pointed this out a couple
of weeks ago but didn't get any response.
There is also some trouble with udma4&5. Both the disk and the controller
claim they support it and it looks like it is properly detected. However
I get these messages when booting:

After this the disk is in udma3 mode and works fine, though it should be able
to go faster. This problem has been present with all kernels from 2.4.10.
I haven't tried earlier ones. I have an Alpha in case it matters.
