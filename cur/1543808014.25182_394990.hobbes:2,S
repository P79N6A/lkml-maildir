Indeed, with 2.6.13
bathl:~# lsattr -d /var/run
lsattr: Inappropriate ioctl for device While reading flags on /var/run
with 2.6.15.3
bathl:~# cat lsatr.out.2.6.15
--S-ia-AcBZXEj-t- /var/run
After the problem came up, I already suspected something like this and 
therefore already had the kernel recompiled without xattr support, so I  
don't know why lsattr shows something for 2.6.15 and nothing for 2.6.13.
here the reiser part from the kernel config of 2.6.13 
CONFIG_REISERFS_FS=y
# CONFIG_REISERFS_CHECK is not set
CONFIG_REISERFS_PROC_INFO=y
CONFIG_REISERFS_FS_XATTR=y
CONFIG_REISERFS_FS_POSIX_ACL=y
CONFIG_REISERFS_FS_SECURITY=y
# CONFIG_JFS_FS is not set
CONFIG_FS_POSIX_ACL=y
here 2.6.15
CONFIG_REISERFS_FS=y
# CONFIG_REISERFS_CHECK is not set
CONFIG_REISERFS_PROC_INFO=y
# CONFIG_REISERFS_FS_XATTR is not set
# CONFIG_JFS_FS is not set
CONFIG_FS_POSIX_ACL=y
# CONFIG_XFS_FS is not set
# CONFIG_MINIX_FS is not set
# CONFIG_ROMFS_FS is not set
Anyway, I never set any attributes using chattr, so these seem to be random 
attributes, nice.
