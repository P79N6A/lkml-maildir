No, I just tried to reworden your idea and I obviously failed.
Previously, I always assumed that the free call had to be delayed, but 
you have shown that this is wrong: If a rcu user can detect that an 
object changed its identity (or if he doesn't care), then it's not 
necessary to delay the free call, it's sufficient to delay the object 
destruction. And since the slab cache is an object cache delaying 
destruction causes virtually no overhead at all.
A second restriction is that it must be possible to recover from 
identity changes. I think this rules out the dentry cache - the hash 
chains point to wrong positions after a free/alloc/reuse cycle, it's not 
possible to recover from that.

Yes, that should work.

This would introduce a concept of a half destroyed object. I think it's 
a bad idea, too easy to introduce bugs.
The correct fix would be to move the whole slab_destroy call into the 
rcu callback instead of just the kmem_cache_free call, but locking would 
be tricky - kmem_cache_destroy would have to wait for completion of 
outstanding rcu calls, etc.
Thus I'd propose a quick fix (fail if there is a dtor - are there any 
slab caches with dtors at all?) and in the long run slab_destroy should 
be moved into the rcu callback.
