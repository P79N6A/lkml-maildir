Maybe this would be better resolved at runtime ?
With the above patch, you'd need three seperate kernel images
to run optimally on a system in each of the cases.
The 'vendor kernel' scenario here looks ugly to me.

And why can't this just be a
	if (ht_enabled)
		shared_runqueue = 1;
Dumping all this into the config system seems to be the
wrong direction IMHO. The myriad of runtime knobs in the
scheduler already is bad enough, without introducing
compile time ones as well.
