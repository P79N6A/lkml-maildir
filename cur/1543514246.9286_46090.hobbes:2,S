Which, given that it's a fieldbus, and is designed specifically for 
communication with dedicated hardware, is not exactly unreasonable.

Definitely 3 character periods. 8E1 IIRC - sorry, I thought I'd said that 
earlier.

Not at all. 'Should' indicates something which an implementation ought 
to do, but it won't fail the certification if it doesn't. Likewise, loosely 
speaking, 'May' indicates something which an implementation isn't expected to 
do, but it won't fail the certification if it does.
It's quite common to use such words in this kind of specification. RFC1122 for 
example, defines MUST, SHOULD and MAY in section 1.3.2:Requirements
 (grep --context=23 \"SHOULD\" /net/src.doc.ic/public/packages/rfc/rfc1122.txt)

Sorry, I misunderstood you there. I see your point, but (unfortunately?) there
are intelligent cards available which provide such support on Windows. It's not
absolutely necessary to use commodity hardware for the bus to succeed 
commercially.
It _is_, however, highly desirable to be able to use commodity hardware for the
Linux support, as well as the intelligent IO cards (for which I already
have one driver in 2.3.current)
