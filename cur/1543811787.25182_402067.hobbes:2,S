Hey,
I am about to port a small PCI module (~500 lines) from a 2.4 to a 2.6
kernel. I browsed Jonathon Corbet's articles on lwn.net but didn't notice
any discussion on the pci differences. Could somebody point me to a small
straightforward driver in the 2.4 tree that has an equally straightforward
source in the 2.6 tree?  The existing driver has poll, ioctl, open,
release, probe, and remove callbacks and that's it. It also uses a mutex
and spin_lock for polling and ioctl when calling
copy_from_user/copy_to_user.
Thanks!
Keith
