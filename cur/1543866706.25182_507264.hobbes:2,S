Subject: [PATCH] FAT: DIO-write fallback to normal buffered
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/10/108

[RESEND: forget to add linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org]
If the DIO write on FAT is expanding the size, it will be fail by -EINVAL,
because FAT can't handle it now.
This patch fallback it to the normal buffered-write and would return
success.
