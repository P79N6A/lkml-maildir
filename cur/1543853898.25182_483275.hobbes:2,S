Hi,
I have a (randconfig) build of 2.6.19-rc5-mm2 with:
CONFIG_DEBUG_READAHEAD=y
which selects DEBUG_FS, so DEBUG_FS=y, but DEBUG_FS depends on
SYSFS, and SYSFS is not set in the randconfig.
This randconfig causes this build error:
fs/built-in.o: In function `debugfs_init':
inode.c:(.init.text+0xdb2): undefined reference to `kernel_subsys'
so the question is:
(How) can kconfig follow the dependency chain and either
- prevent this odd config combination or
- see that 'select DEBUG_FS' implies 'select SYSFS' and then enable SYSFS
?
I don't believe that the right answer is to add
	depends on SYSFS
to DEBUG_READAHEAD.
.config is at

Thanks,
