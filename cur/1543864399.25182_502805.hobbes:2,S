OK, now I fully understand what you are after.  I kept on thinking in the
context of hugetlb. You are correct that ia64 does not have proper address
check for find_extend_vma() and it is indeed a potentially very bad bug in
there. I'm with you, I don't see the equivalent RGN_MAP_LIMIT check in the
get_user_pages() path.
Forwarding this to Tony as I don't have any access to ia64 machine anymore
to test/validate a fix.
