Yes, that is correct.

Thanks for the tip... the link that you referred to was most useful. I 
might now have an idea what the problem might be... Further on in the 
thread <http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=reiserfs&m=108117079808733&w=2> 
it says that there is something in the patch that "can lead to a 
dirtied_when in the future, and missed writeback". Well, what happens 
if the directory that I am missing was in that writeback that got 
missed?
I will try updating the debian patch myself and give it another test 
tonight and will report back on my findings. But, before I do so, does 
it seem likely that this could cause the problem?
Cheers,
Paul
