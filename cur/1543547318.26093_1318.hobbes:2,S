The thread manager, is I see it in the moment, will consist more or
less of this:
	extern volatile int nthreads;
	do
	  waitpid (0, &res, __WCLONE)
	while (nthreads > 0);
	exit (WEXITSTATUS (res));
No signal handler, since it cannot receive signals.  Everything else
the threads will do themselves.
There is a problem though: the code we currently use for something
like restarting depends on the manager doing this.  This can be
implemented in two ways:
- send the manager a signal; this would require the threadkill() syscall
  already mentioned.  Note that we can assume RT signals and therefore
  can transport data.  But we get into problems if too many RT signals
  are queued.
- extend the loop above to something similar to what we have today:
    do
      n = poll (..,..,.., timeout);
      check_for_dead_threads();  // use WNOHANG
      if (n > 0)
        read request and process it
    while (nthreads > 0)
  I really would like to avoid this.  It has the problems we are
  seeing today:
  * high latency of these requests
  * must adjust the priority of the manager (this now gets complicated
    since it's not the manager which start the threads)
  * problems with changing UID/GID
It will require some investigation to see whether we can implement the
restart semantics correctly without a manager thread.  If yes, we
should be able to live with the simple loop.
