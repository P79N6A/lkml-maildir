I didn't have time to answer his mail then, but I will try to do so now.
Mr. Cowan asserts that today Linux is used mainly as a single-user
machine or a dedicated network servers and that AppArmor is designed to
secure these.
For me, this is not enough, because I also need to secure multi-user
computers and I don't want to learn a new security mechanism for these
machines. (I worked several years as a system administrator for a
university where this was my main job).
But the more important point is that, IMO, AppArmor also fails to secure
e.g. dedicated network servers. Consider for example an Apache server
where users are allowed to install CGIs. How do you prevent an attacker
from subverting a buggy CGI and using the host to send spam? 
(Hint: It's really easy using standard SELinux policy).

Well, let's have a look at how Linux is used at e.g. university (that's
where I have the most experience). Lot's of untrusted students, doing
lots of weird things. They need to be allowed to run all sorts of
software, experiment with Linux, share files locally and so on. It's not
easy to confine such users.
On those machines, you don't care very much about individual users (if a
user is stupid enough to get his account hacked you just wipe his
homedir and restore from backup), but you do care about system integrity
and secrecy of things like /etc/shadow.
It is possible to confine such a system using SELinux (I've done it). Is
it possible using AppArmor? As far as I understood it is not. For me,
that's a severe limit in functionality.
