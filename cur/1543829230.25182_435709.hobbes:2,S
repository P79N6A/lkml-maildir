Right. The IBM thinkpad probably works (well, at least _that_ one: 
there's tons of different Thinkpads, they have different cardbus 
controllers, and at least one of them has some other problem).
However, changing the IO window size just hides the problem on the machine 
that breaks this time around, and we should really fix _that_, rather than 
hide it (because otherwise it will break again when we do something else 
unrelated that just happens to change the order we do things in).
