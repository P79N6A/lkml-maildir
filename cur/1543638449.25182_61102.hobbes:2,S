If application is using readdir, then yes: glibc internally maps readdir
into getdents plus at most one lseek on directory for "adjustment"
purposes (if I remember correctly, problem is that kernel struct dirent
has extra field and glibc cannot tell in advance how many of them will
fit into supplied user buffer).
But if application uses seekdir(3)/telldir(3) directly---then no.
