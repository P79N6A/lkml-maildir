This patch seems to break any other pseudo tty drivers, (ie driver->type 
==TTY_DRIVER_TYPE_PTY) since not all the tty functions needed for the 
driver's new driver->install method are exported from tty_io.c.  The 
function symbols that need to be exported from /drivers/char/tty_io.c are 
the following:
   EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(alloc_tty_struct);
   EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(free_tty_struct);
   EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(tty_init_termios);
   EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(initialize_tty_struct);
I've added these lines and recompiled a 2.6.28 kernel along with adding 
new driver->install methods to my master and slave pseudo tty driver and 
it seems to work fine now.
Before I go ahead and post a patch, does anyone see any problems with 
this?
