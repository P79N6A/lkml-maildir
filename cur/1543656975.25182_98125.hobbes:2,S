Disclaimer at the bottom. ;)
It was once posted on this list that the NForce is similar to some
existing hardware. hence the sound driver uses the Intel i810 audio
driver. I guess if you can search through the archive you might find
that discussion. If you do find it and _are_ clued-up enough, then you
can look at drivers/char/agp/agpgart_be.c approximately line 3900 they
start defining which drivers to use for which bus.
So you need to
1. Find the id for the AGP bus for the NForce and define it in agp.h
(lspci should do the trick IIRC on my PC 00:01.0 is the agp bus)
2. Find out which hardware the bus is similar to, then add the support
for the NForce using the setup for that driver
e.g.
agp.h
add
#ifndef PCI_DEVICE_ID_NVIDIA_NFORCORCE_2   //I'm not sure about the
naming standard
#define PCI_DEVICE_ID_NVIDIA_NFORCORCE_2	0x(Hex value from lspci)
#endif
the in agpgart_be.c
add (for example lets say the bus is similar to Intel's i860 agp bus
then)
#ifdef CONFIG_AGP_INTEL
...
{ PCI_DEVICE_ID_NVIDIA_NFORCORCE_2,
                PCI_VENDOR_ID_NVIDIA,
                INTEL_I860,
                "NVidia",
                "NForce2",
                intel_860_setup },
....
#endif /* CONFIG_AGP_INTEL */
DISCLAIMER : I do not know anything about the agp code, except for what
I have read when trying to find a solution for you. The examples above
are from what my eyes came across at 1:00 am without prio knowledge to
the agp code. So if you implement these examples you do it at you own
(and maybe your pets) risk. The examples come with.... you should now
how the rest goes ;)

For future reference - don't anybody else try to send patches as vi
scripts, please. Yes, it's manly, but let's face it, so is
bungee-jumping with the cord tied to your testicles.
