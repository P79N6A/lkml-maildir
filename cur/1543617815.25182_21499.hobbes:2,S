Hello Trond,                                                          
Hello Marcelo,                                                        
as stated earlier I tried your (Marcelo's) back-patch for 2.4.18-pre4 
and now nfs with Unixware server 7 works !                            
Obviously this mII stuff is somehow broken, or triggers some          
well-hidden bug somewhere.                                            
If you need further info please let me know.                          
Sorry for not following up your previous mails, but I'm currently     
out-of-office.                                                        
Only wanted to let you now quickly.                                   
Regards,                                                              
Stephan
