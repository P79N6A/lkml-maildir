1) I'm not.  You're getting your players confused.
2) I don't think Marcelo would take it, so I wouldn't even bother offering it 
to him.
3) I'm suggesting that if it does go in the old method doesn't go away, so 
that people who don't want to use the new stuff don't have to.  I think 
making the old pile of cruft disappear in a stable series IS a bad thing.  
However, if adding new modular subsystems which people don't have to use (and 
which require newer tools if you DO want to use them) was a bad thing...  
Reiser, ext3, and the new vm circa 2.4.10 broke several GUI system monitors...
