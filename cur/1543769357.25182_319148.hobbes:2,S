I don't understand.  The tree _has_ to be detached when no task uses
the namespace.  That is the main purpose of the namespace structure,
to provide an anchor for the mount tree.

This is the key issue I think.  It may even have security implications
in the future if we want to allow unprivileged mounts : a user could
DoS the system by just doing lots of mounts umounts in a private
namespace.
