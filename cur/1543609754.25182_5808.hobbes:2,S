   that is - of course - a more pppoatm specific fix BUT my concern
   ist that PPP requires (!) to have at least 2 bytes headroom [when
   using PPP_FILTER] (which is NOT noted), and isn't it good practice
   to check for room before claiming it?
Ignore my comments, I thought this was happening on output.
Yes, it seems ppp_generic should be verifying the headroom.
Franks a lot,
