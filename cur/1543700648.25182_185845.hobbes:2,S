My plans are to move the code to drivers/xtalk/ once it's finished, es.

It's currently supported, but I'm aiming for common code for the common
parts (pcibr drivers,  xbow driver, hub/shub driver, xtalk discovery,
some prom interface code).  I've already sent you my merged dma mapping
code and I have similar code for hub and bridge/xbridge/pic/tiocp level
pio mapping and xtalk discovery.
There's of course code that will stay in the per-arch directories like
the lowlevel interrupt code, etc..  Now this isn't something that happens
from one day to another, but not not putting stones in the way of each
other would help greatly..
