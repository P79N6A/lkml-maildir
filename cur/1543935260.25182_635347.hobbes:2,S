I'm sorry, I stand corrected, there is a data=journal option but not on a
mount point, as an attribute of a bunch of directories (postfix queues):
# lsattr /var/spool/postfix/
-------A-----j---- /var/spool/postfix/active
-------A-----j---- /var/spool/postfix/bounce
-------A-----j---- /var/spool/postfix/corrupt
-------A-----j---- /var/spool/postfix/defer
-------A-----j---- /var/spool/postfix/deferred
-------A-----j---- /var/spool/postfix/flush
-------A-----j---- /var/spool/postfix/hold
-------A-----j---- /var/spool/postfix/incoming
-------A-----j---- /var/spool/postfix/private
-------A-----j---- /var/spool/postfix/maildrop
-------A-----j---- /var/spool/postfix/public
-------A-----j---- /var/spool/postfix/pid
-------A-----j---- /var/spool/postfix/saved
-------A-----j---- /var/spool/postfix/trace
The idea was that queue file are short-lived files and thus they could
only be stored in the journal and never hit the regular data area.
So I might have hit the deadlock you were talking about.
I just disabled this setup, we'll see if that changes anything.
Note that I was using this setup since 2.4 time, the problem appeared only
a few kernel revisions ago (around 2.6.18 I think).
Thanks
