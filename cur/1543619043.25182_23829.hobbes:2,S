That's very nearly what I proposed in the second half of my message (with
the exception that we ought to pre-fault the current stack and code page
tables as we're sure to need these immediately).
Daniel's approach seems to be workable (once he's spelled out all the
details) but it misses the big performance win for fork/exec, which is
surely the common case. Given that exec will be throwing away all these
mappings, we can safely assume that we will not be inheriting many shared
mappings from parents of parents so Daniel's approach also still ends up
marking most of the pages RO still.
