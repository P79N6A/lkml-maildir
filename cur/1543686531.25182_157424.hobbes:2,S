Subject: 2.6.0-test3 - the state of ACPI STR?

I compiled kernel with CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP=y but doing echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep 
just hangs; SysRq works but task list is too long for video console.
if it is supposed to work I probably arrange for serial output; the system is 
ASUS CUSL2 desktop, STR works under Windows.
TIA
