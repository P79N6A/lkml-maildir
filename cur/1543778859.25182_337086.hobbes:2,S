There's a big difference between 'unreviewed' and 'untested'.
With drivers that support n variants of a piece of hardware,
hearing back that a driver works fine from someone isn't really
worth anything if the changes break for all the other users
of that driver that have a different variant, which haven't tested it yet.
We have a testing/review process in place, attempts to short-circuit
it should be prevented. Especially from a subsystem that
historically has had a number of issues wrt regressions each release.
