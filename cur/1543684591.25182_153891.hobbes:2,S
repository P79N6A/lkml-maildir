There are two reasons the uid/gid stuff can't change.
#1 Lots of non posix afflicted intelligent programmers use the per
thread uid stuff in daemons. Its really really useful
#2 Linux fundamentally assumes your security credentials don't change
mid syscall except in the specific calls we intend to.
#2 is not sanely soluble for 2.6, and of questionable value anyway, #1
is a very good reason for making libc fix up this obscure posix
stupidity itself.
Lets face it how many posix pthreads app have -performance critical
setuid/getid calls ?
