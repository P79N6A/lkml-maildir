I would like to add my two pennies...
At home I have a box with 4 IDE controllers (8 channels).  Up to and
including 2.4.20 I needed a kernel parameter list specifying
addresses, ata66, etc. for all but ide0 and ide1, as well as another
couple tweaks.  I literally was *at* the line length limit.  While my
specific situation was eased by .21 and .22 (all I need now is
'ide=reverse'), IMVHO as long as there is a hard limit on the
parameter line length it would be very nice to have the option of
minimizing what needs to be specified.
(FWIW I use lilo; I've never tried grub.  I haven't actually looked
whether the line length limit is in lilo or the kernel.)
