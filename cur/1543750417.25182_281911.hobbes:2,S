It does not, the patch is not part of the linux kernel. There is nothing
which is tracing permission checks. 
Of course this might become interesting, if you want to do full audit log,
however the current functionality in the kernel infrastructure is not very
well suited for that, since you would habe to do stack analysis for
meaningful traces (like "who checked access permission, why")
