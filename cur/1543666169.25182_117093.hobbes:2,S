<jgarzik@redhat.com> (03/03/13 1.1109)
   [hw_random] fixes and cleanups
   
   * s/Via/VIA/
   * allow multiple simultaneous open(2)s of the chrdev.  This allows
   us to eliminate some code, without modifying the core code (rng_dev_read)
   at all.
   * s/__exit// in ->cleanup ops, to eliminate link error
<jgarzik@redhat.com> (03/03/13 1.1108)
   [hw_random] add support for VIA Nehemiah RNG ("xstore" instruction)
<jgarzik@redhat.com> (03/03/13 1.1107)
   [ia32] cpu capabilities cleanups and additions
   
   * Add support for new Centaur(VIA) and Intel cpuid feature bits,
     expanding the x86_capability array by two.
   * (cleanup) Move cpu setup for newer Via C3 cpus into its own
     function, init_c3()
   * Add support for RNG control msr on VIA Nehemiah
   * export X86_FEATURE_XSTORE and cpu_has_xstore macros so that
     kernel code may easily test for cpu support of the new
     "xstore" instruction.
<jgarzik@redhat.com> (03/03/13 1.1106)
   [hw_random] update amd768_rng driver to be modular; add Intel support
   
   Take Alan's amd768_rng driver, recently renamed to hw_random.c,
   and convert it's very-simple structure to support multiple
   types of hardware RNG.  Integrate Intel i8xx (ICH) RNG support.
<jgarzik@redhat.com> (03/03/13 1.1105)
   [hw_random] shuffle files in preparation for hw_random driver update
   
   Delete drivers/char/i810_rng.c, superceded.
   Rename Doc/i810_rng.txt to Doc/hw_random.txt.
   Rename drv/char/amd768_rng.c to drv/char/hw_random.c.
