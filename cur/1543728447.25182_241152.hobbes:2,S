Yes, but if I was to understand it right, dump will close/reopen at "700000"
(whatever that is, 700000kb?).  That won't work with cdrecord since it's
expecting a single input stream, not many seperated by a pause.  I'd
consider it more like using tar with the multiple tape option.  When it is
finished writing to a tape, it'll wait for the user to physically change
tapes and start writing at the beginning of the new tape.
