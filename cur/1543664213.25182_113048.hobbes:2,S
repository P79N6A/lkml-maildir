No.

GCC can do that with -fstrict-aliasing:
All calls to this inline function are done with constant event_len.
E.g. in case of event_len = IW_EV_UINT_LEN, memcpy macro expands to
__constant_memcpy which does:
                        *(unsigned long *)to = *(const unsigned long *)from;
                        *(1+(unsigned long *)to) = *(1+(const unsigned long *)from);
iwe->len is unsigned short and the code writes the value as
unsigned short (iwe->len = 8) and then reads the same memory as unsigned
long (something = *(const unsigned long *)(char *)iwe). But those two types
cannot alias and thus gcc can reorder them.
To fix that, __constant_memcpy would have to access the data through
union, ir you could as well forget about __constant_memcpy and use
__builtin_memcpy where gcc will take care about the constant copying.
