depends on ... && ACPI ?
See also the other mail discussing how to handle the two methods to detect
speed.
Unfortunately, I consider this new ACPI driver to be in an "unmergeable"
state, as the extra "polling" is unneccessary if the ACPI perflib is used,
the extra parsing of ACPI tables can fail much too easily, and the whole
driver is too fragile with regard to ACPI interaction.
