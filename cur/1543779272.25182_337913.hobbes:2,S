I can't explain but we may try to fix it with your help.
As a general remark, dmesg + .config + lspci -vx/lsmod help figuring the
hardware environment.
1 - can the regression be reproduced with last -rc (namely 2.6.13-rc4) ?
2 - if yes, can you isolate a simple operation to trigger the bug: I assume
    you read the DVD from hell with some nice viewer under X. Can you
    reproduce the bug in a simple console, without X, through a 'dd'
    command for instance ?
3 - if so, did you notice extra messages ? Is led activity available ?
4 - if you are still stuck, you can start a binary search on the 2.6.12-rc
    kernels, then on the 2.6.12-rcX-gitY to isolate the trigger (it may not
    necessarily be the culprit).
