I added EXPORT_SYMBOL(fn_name) for all the functions that I wanted to
access from my module. I also added MODULE_LICENSE("GPL") to the .c file.
And in the Makefile I added my_file.o to 'export_objs'. However I am still getting
the same error.
Any suggestions ? Are there any resources online which I can read.
Thanks,
Rahul.
