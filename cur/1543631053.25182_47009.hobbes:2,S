This is insecure.
A user has a defined security context.  If the user can create code that 
is then executed in a different security context (user httpd/nobody), then 
you've got a potential problem.  If you have multiple users who can 
create code that executes in the *same* security context, you have a 
recipe for disaster.
user1 can write a web app the delete/modifies the web app, or web app 
created files of user2.
