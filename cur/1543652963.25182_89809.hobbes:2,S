mozilla handles it this way: the bug starts as unconfirmed. they have a 
volunteer group of pre screeners. Only when one of these people sets
it to valid or similar then the owners of the module get mail.
I guess that could work for the linux kernel bugzilla too. Never hazzle
a developer, until someone confirmed the bug in some way (this does not
mean that he needs to reproduce it, just weed out obvious duplicates
and bogus postings)
