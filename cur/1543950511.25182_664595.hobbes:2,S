Hello,
With regard to the posting at 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/6/131
 I can
say that from a user point of view the implementation works very well.
Judging from the response of the developers here the source code of the
patch is OK.
So: could you please include this PPS implementation in the kernel?
Kind regards,
Udo
