ACPI is where those PnP entries are coming from (on any modern system 
anyway). They do show up in Device Manager as devices with resources 
(the one that reserves all of system RAM on my machine is labeled 
"System board", others like the one that reserves the MMCONFIG aperature 
are "Motherboard resources" - the name is based on the PNP device ID, I 
believe).
It could be that Windows is stupid enough that it will map things over 
top of physical RAM if the BIOS doesn't explicitly reserve it like that. 
  I suspect based on some comments in Microsoft documents that Windows 
uses the E820 table to figure out where the RAM is, and ACPI/PnP 
information to figure out where IO mappings are, but may not really 
combine those two pieces of information into one overall map like Linux 
does, which would explain why it needs to reserve all physical RAM..
(As mentioned in another post, I would guess the BIOS is reserving that 
memory range since it's the MMCONFIG aperture..)
