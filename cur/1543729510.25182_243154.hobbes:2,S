Doesn't that make it kinda rough on the folks trying to write
arch-independent code, such as sound/core/pcm_native.c that I am
tripping over?
I can imagine a possible 'solution' something like (1) always passing
six args, and (2) providing arch-dependent macros to generate those last
two args, from some arch-generic value.
Just brainstorming ...
