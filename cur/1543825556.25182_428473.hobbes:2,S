I have a question about the best way to share memory between user and
kernel space.
Let's say I have a common structure;
struct counter {
	u_long interrupt_counts;
	bool saw_interupt;
}
And I need to be able to modify these elements from both the kernel and
user space.  What is the best way to allocate this???  I've tried
several methods including __get_free_pages, alloc_pages, vmalloc and so
on; and thus far, I'm just confused myself.
Can someone help me out here with a quick example of some sort???
Thanks,
:b!
