	The idea is to convice others that your idea is a good once.  Treating
others disrepectfully is not a good way to convice other people you're right.

	'special' files are files that have special attributes, not that go
away when the power goes off.

	No, it was a hack.  The permissions were not stored w/ the file.  They
were not stored on even the same filesystem that the file was.

	Why does devfs have to be mounted then?  Sounds like it could do what
it wants without being mounted and trying to play like a filesystem, when it
actually isn't one..
