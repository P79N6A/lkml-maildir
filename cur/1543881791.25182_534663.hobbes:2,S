Presumably, the cnodes in the other chunks contain forward and back
references.  Those need to contain at minimum inode + generation + chunk
to avoid problem of pointing to a _different_ inode after such corruption
caused the old inode to be deleted and a new one allocated in its place.
If the cnode in each chunk is more than just a singly-linked list, the
file as a whole could survive multiple chunk corruptions, though there
would now be holes in the file.

There are several cases where such corruption could be found:
- file access from the "parent" cnode will be missing corrupted cnode,
  probably causing a fsck of both the source and target chunks
- a fsck of the source chunk would find the dangling cnode reference
  and cause a fsck of the corrupt chunk
- a fsck of the later cnode chunks would find the dangling cnode reference
  and cause a fsck of the corrupt chunk
- a fsck of the corrupt chunk would find the original corruption
The case where only a fsck of the corrupt chunk is done would not find the
cnode references.  Maybe there needs to be per-chunk info which contains
a list/bitmap of other chunks that have cnodes shared with each chunk?
