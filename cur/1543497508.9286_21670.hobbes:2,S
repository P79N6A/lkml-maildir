This simple zero-copy isn't really a win on most PC hardware as it takes
about the same amount of time to do a checksum as it does to do a checksum
and copy.
A more powerful scheme is being investigated by sct and a couple others. A
related scheme worked out on FreeBSD and presented at a recent Usenix
could cache checksums, for example.
