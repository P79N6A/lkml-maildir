Subject: MSDOS fs type broke in 2.2.x

I noticed that when I installed the 2.2.x kernels
that all of my msdos mounts were broken, and fs
type "msdos" was unrecognized.  Was "msdos" fs
support dropped?  Was this a config error?  I
can still use vfat and umsdos fs's.
I haven't found anything about this in any of the 2.2
docs.
