Hello,
Please refer to Andrew' post on this thread on PCI
subsystem assigning prefetchable memory bigger than
4GB:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/24/160
This patch is not included in 2.6.20.1 or earlier --
it would be helpful if we could have this patch
considered. I have tried it in a simulated environment
and it works.
Thanks.
Ashish
