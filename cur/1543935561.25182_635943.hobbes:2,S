Just wondering - nothing personal at all. What's the official plan for 
this - do we want (when utf8 works) to use utf8 codes for symbols only for 
languages mostly based on ASCII, like iso-8859-15, or for all? Would we, 
for example, then also write Cyrillic names in utf-8 and every other 
alphabet for that matter? Didn't find anything under Documentation about 
that. Maybe we want to document it somewhere? Wasn't C-sources originally 
supposed to be ASCII? So, what we use in sources, what under Documentation 
or in MAINTAINERS may be different matters?
Thanks
Guennadi
