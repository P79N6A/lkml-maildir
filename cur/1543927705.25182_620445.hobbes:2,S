That wouldn't work for MODULE_ALLOW() because it appends the namespace
to other identifiers. I don't know of a way in the C processor to get
back from a string to a ## concatenable identifier.
For EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS it would be in theory possible, but making 
it asymmetric to MODULE_ALLOW would be ugly imho.
