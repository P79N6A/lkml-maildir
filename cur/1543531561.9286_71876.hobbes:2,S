Simple trick is to have the filesystem ask the "hosting" (i.e. the one who opens
it first and has write access) to do the write for you transparently.  Or, more
simply, if you find that the partition is open, simply make the mount into an NFS
mount instead.  Voila, you have (in some, very small way) something like
TruClusters.  Of course, the technology they use is just a twitch more complicated
than that, but it's the general idea.
