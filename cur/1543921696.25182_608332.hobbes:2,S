Yep, I believe this driver is GPLed. They published the source and
there's nothing to suggest otherwise, and there's explicit:
#define DRIVER_AUTHOR                   "Jeff Lee<YY_Lee@issc.com.tw>"
#define DRIVER_DESC                             "IS89C35 802.11bg WLAN USB Driver"
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
