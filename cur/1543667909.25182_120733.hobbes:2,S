Hi Jesus !
I have tried to hunt down our problem a lot of hours, but without Success.
Neither the bk-patches nor the mm-patches cure the panic, i've tried 3
different compilers and two binutils.
The strangest thing about this is that we seem to be the only people triggering
the bug, as there is no echo in the LKML.
I give up and go back to 2.5.65 :-(
Below some debugging statements, if there should be somewhere outside
who likes to spent his time in frustrating debugging Sessions ...
Bye
    Norbert
----
Kernel: Linux 2.5.66  (no Problems with 2.5.65 with same .config ! )
Compiler: gcc 2.95.3 (also tried 3.2.2 and 3.4-CVS)
No Modules, no lvm, no raid, no initrd, tried with and without devfs.
VFS: Cannot open root device "301" or ide(3,1)  <- my /dev/hda1 boot-partition
                                                                     (reiserfs)
sys_mount("sysfs", "/sys", "sysfs", 0, NULL) succeeds
sys_mknod for /dev/root                      succeeds
sys_mount for /dev/root   returns ENOENT     -> Panic
