The evaluation teams that I have worked with (OrangeBook and CC)
as well as their technical advisory groups have always been clear
that keyboard logging is not an appropriate mechanism for security
audit logging. There is insufficient correlation between what is
typed and security relevent actions for keyboard (or mouse event)
logging to meet the audit requirements. You have to log what happened.
Logging what was requested is insufficient and logging what was
typed, which may or may not have resulted in an actual request is
not helpful to meeting security audit requirements.
