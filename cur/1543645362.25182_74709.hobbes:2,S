I have noticed this problem in 2.5.39 except it occurs with the module 
uhci-hcd.  I can work around the problem by using the 'nousb' feature that 
the redhat rc scripts recognize.  I then load the modules by hand with 
pcmcia initialization first (pcmcia_core->yenta_socket->ds) then usb
ohci-hcd, uhci-hcd, then ehci-hcd last.  Then I can go ahead and load the 
hid and usb-storage drivers also.
