I definitely prefer this kind of encapsulation over #ifdef DEVEXIT_LINKED
everywhere, it's still ugly, though.
However, I don't see much advantage of panic_exit_code() over a simple
NULL. Actually, NULL will only oops, but not take the machine down, which
makes it easier to catch and report the Oops. (Not everyone who's box 
crashes under X will setup a serial console).
