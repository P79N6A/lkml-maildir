Sigh... I see what happens, and yes, it's a bug, but fix is wrong.
The real problem is with get_sb_single(), not with do_mount().
get_sb_bdev() and get_sb_nodev() are actually fine and your fix will
break them.
The problem is in the way we keep count for FS_SINGLE - in my current
tree I switched to cleaner variant, but doing the same in 2.4 may be tricky.
_Probably_ the right way to deal with that (for the time being) is add
	if (fstype->fs_flags & FS_SINGLE)
		put_filesystem(fstype);
before the if (list_empty(...))
IOW,

should be OK for now. Once we get clean refcounting for struct super_block
we will be able to get rid of the kludges in that area completely.
