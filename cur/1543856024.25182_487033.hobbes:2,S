Yes, you can specify the mem= using K notation, but there is a test in
arch/arm/mm/mm-armv.c:create_mapping() that prevents the mapping from
being created if the boundaries are not MB aligned:
	if (mem_types[md->type].prot_l1 == 0 &&
	    (virt & 0xfffff || (virt + off) & 0xfffff || (virt + length)
& 0xfffff)) {
		printk(KERN_WARNING "BUG: map for 0x%08lx at 0x%08lx can
not "
		       "be mapped using pages, ignoring.\n",
		       __pfn_to_phys(md->pfn), md->virtual);
		return;
	}
This is in linux-2.6.16.29.

Kernel version is 2.6.16.29 and the reserve_bootmem() call above is at
the top of the function devicemaps_init().
