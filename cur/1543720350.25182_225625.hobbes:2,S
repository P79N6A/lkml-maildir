Subject: [PATCH] (urgent) ppc32: Fix CPUs with soft loaded TLB
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi !
The recent introduction of ptep_set_access_flags() with the optimisation
of not flushing the TLB unfortunately broke ppc32 CPUs with no hash table.
The data access exception code path in assembly for these doesn't properly
deal with the case where the TLB entry is present with the wrong PAGE_RW and
will just call do_page_fault again instead of just replacing the TLB entry.
Fixing the asm code for all the different CPU types affected (yah, embedded
PPCs all have different MMUs =P) is painful and need testing I can't do at
the moment, so here's a fix that will just flush the TLB page when changing
the access flags on non-hash based machines. Please apply.
