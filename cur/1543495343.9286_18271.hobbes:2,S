Sounds like yet another problem caused by the lack of clarity (I didn't see
a definitive answer go by here two weeks ago - maybe I missed it) as to
exactly which directories 'x' in /usr/include should be symlinks to
/usr/src/linux/include/'x'.  The README for 2.0.36 says asm, linux, and
scsi.  The README for 2.2.x says nothing about this.  An inconclusive debate
ensued.
Depending on your Linux distrib, the configuration of your /usr/include
directory may or may not be valid for a 2.2.x kernel.
