Not only that.  You also need to save some driver data so that it can restore
the devices state from before the hibernation.  [Say you have a task blocked
on the driver's mutex in .read().  In that case you'd want the .read() to be
carried out after the restore in the same way in which it would have been
caried out if the hibernation hadn't occur.]

I think that device_shutdown() is just inappropriate, because in principle
it doesn't allow you to save any information related to the device state
before hibernation that may be needed after the restore.

I would do in in the machine_kexec step.
