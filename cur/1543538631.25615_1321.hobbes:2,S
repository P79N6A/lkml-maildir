	Thanks, but I subsequently submitted a patch very much like
yours, except that it only changed the second of the two lines that
you changed (in exactly the same way).  There is no need to change
the part that does not do the long division, and my approach would have
the advantage that if the count were to exceed 2**32 cycles, at least
the total number of cycles would be correctly printed.  However, come
to think of it, the format string then needs to changed.  So,
here is a corrected patch.  I have rebuilt the arcnet drivers with
this patch and verified that they build and there are no undefined
symbols in the kernel modules.
