BTW, that's not to say that having parallel hierarchies of containers
is necessarily a bad thing - I can imagine just mounting multiple
instances of containerfs, each managing one of the container pointers
in task_struct - but I think that could be added on afterwards. Even
if we did have the parallel support, we'd still need to support
multiple subsystems/controllers on the same hierarchy, since I think
that's going to be the much more common case.
