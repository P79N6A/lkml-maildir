Just thinking a bit more about implementing poll() - that part should
be pretty simple, but how does the read-side know how much to read,
unless it's reading fixed-size blocks?  To do that without using a
system call or IOCTL or sysfs file, you could reserve a part of the
channel or a part of each sub-buffer (relayfs channels are subdivided
into a number of sub-buffers) for info the read-side would need in
order to read what's ready.  The rchan_start_reserve, start_reserve,
and end_reserve parameters to relay_open() are used for this purpose.
The one complication here is that if an event won't fit into the
current sub-buffer, the remainder will be filled with filler, and the
event will be put into the following sub-buffer.  The amount of filler
is available from within the buffer_end() callback, and this value
should also be part of the data the read-side would need in order to
process the event.  The size lost to filler shouldn't be an issue if
you use a large enough sub-buffer size and should be pretty easy to
account for in your user-side application.
LTT makes use of all of the above, but as a 'bulk' client, meaning it
processes complete sub-buffers, doesn't need to be super-efficient on
sub-buffer boundaries, and can get away with using a signal/syscall
protocol.  dynamic printk, another relayfs client, is a 'packet'
client, meaning its readers are notified after each completed write,
but its userspace app (klogd) basically loops on read(2).  What I
think you want is to be a 'packet' client, and to implement your
protocol using space reserved within the mmapped buffer.  I think
relayfs has all the elements you'd need to do this pretty easily, with
the exception of the poll(2) support, which is at the top of my todo
list.
Hope this helps,
Tom
