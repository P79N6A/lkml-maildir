ooh, nasty, yes.  You must be testing the crap out if it.

PG_writeback protects the page from truncate, from invalidate and from page
reclaim.  pagevec_strip() won't touch the buffers due to the
PageWriteback() test in try_to_release_page().  So I think we're OK in
there.  I can add a couple more coment fixes for this.
