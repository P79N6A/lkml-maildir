Better yet, we should do away with all install targets beyond assembling
the bootable images and provide sample install scripts in /scripts. Most
of it is already at odds with the distro's install and the remainder
becomes a maintenance issue with initramfs. Distro folks are going to be
working on initramfs-libc for their boot disks anyway and will undoubted
want to tweak such stuff greatly. Let's include Viro's
minimal-userspace-boot.c in scripts along with a
build-minimal-initramfs.sh and leave it at that.
