Give some days, so customers won't complain...
I realised something strange testing again the database server (explained 
below).
Is there any kernel related explanation? Or the test is no reliable?
Just for curiosity, I did the same dbase test again among 2.2.9 and
2.2.10. 
2.2.9 is a little faster (or better to say, consumes less CPU), about 2%.
I also noticed the biggest differences are in sys and user times. Sys
times in 2.2.10 are about 10% larger than in 2.2.9. I did not find the
reason in the patch, may be in VFS or TCP changes? All accessed data was
loaded to the page cache (about 150 MB in 450MB free RAM).
The database server I am using does an accept on a TCP socket (only one ip
address), which in the 80% was established from a client in the same
machine (the other 20% from a PII UP running 2.2.9). The server does a a
fork for each new connection. 
The "signature" of the process is as follows (snapshot from 2.2.10 after
70.000 operations)
