Hi Steve, Thanks once again :)
    I searched arch/i386/kernel/irq.c, and got this line of code:
    irqctx->tinfo.task = curctx->tinfo.task;
    I think it just is answer that I want to get. It seem interrupt 
stack is
created at top of the original kernel stack. Are my words right?
    In passing, How 'current' work in this case when we disable 4KSTACK?
I just found these code only be compiled when we define CONFIG_4KSTACK,
but cann't found #else branch relevantly.
