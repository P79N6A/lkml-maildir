That's easier yet.
	bk diffs -Cv2.5.8

Did you get that backwards?  Do you want to see N diffs on a single
file or do you want one?  We can do either, diffs -C does one.
Also, we're planning on making a "push stack", which remembers the set of
csets pushed each time, so you can do
	bk undo	# remove the last push effects
	bk undo	# remove the last push effects
	..
	bk undo	# remove the clone effects and destroy the repository
You could use that to generate these patches you want.
