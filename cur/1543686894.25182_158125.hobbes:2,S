Here's the line that I used in my demo at OLS 2003 for udev:
	# USB camera from Fuji to be named "camera"
	LABEL, BUS="usb", vendor="FUJIFILM", NAME="camera"
This is a scsi device on the USB bus that has the vendor name "FUJIFILM"
in it's scsi sysfs directory.
Now, partition issues asside (all partitions of this device will be
named camera, camera1, camera2, etc., but I'm working on identifying
partitions better) this shows that the vendor of a scsi device is able
to be named uniquely.
Does that help?  Have you looked at the 2003 OLS paper about udev for
more information?
thanks,
