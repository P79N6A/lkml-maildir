Subject: via82cxxx resume failure.

On resume from sleep, via_set_speed() doesn't reinstate the correct DMA
mode, because it thinks the drive is already configured correctly. This
one-line hack is sufficient to make it refrain from dying a horrible
death immediately after resume, but presumably has other problems...
