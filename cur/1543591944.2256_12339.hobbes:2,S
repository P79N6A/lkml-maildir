Thanks but I've already tried that. You get a slightly different pattern
to the loop but it still loops.

RFC1661 states: multiple actions may be implemented in any convenient order.
So if it had worked we'd still have been conformant.
I've also tried dropping selected packets when I see the condition, simulating
a noisy line or buggy driver whilst keeping the PPP state machine conformant.
Problem is you need to generate the conf-ack to get the remote end into the
LCP opened state whilst not dropping out of it yourself.
