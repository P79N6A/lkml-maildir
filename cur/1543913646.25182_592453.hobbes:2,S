I'd like to take a run at it. The only issue I foresee is what to do
about multiple OR dependencies. There are some kconfig options that
depend on at least one of a set of specified dependencies. For example,
is ARCH_SPARSEMEM_ENABLE selectable if only one of NUMA || EXPERIMENTAL
is selected? So do we abort, select one, or select all dependencies?
Maybe I'm misunderstanding the usage of || here though. I'm assuming
inclusive OR.
