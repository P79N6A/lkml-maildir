Hm. I don't think we want to trigger udev with some remove/add events
(especially since it is still the same device, it just has been moved
around). A change event doesn't sound quite right either. But I guess
we need to do something, at least to make HAL happy since it remembers
the path in sysfs (although I seem to remember a HAL patch that got rid
of it?)
