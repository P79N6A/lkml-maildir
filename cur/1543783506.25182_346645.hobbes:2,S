It is on many windows systems which include extra drivers that come with

See previous discussion, this is untrue. It may not have been the intent
of the standards authors but its certainly the idea of a large number of
disk and system vendors that the HPA is a handy way to deal with old
BIOSes and other items of that nature.

And in the real world BIOSes don't get updated often by vendors let
alone by users.
