gettimeofday() already has about microsecond accuracy (better on some
systems, worse on others).  A good precision delay is already possible.
What's not possible is a precise delay while letting another task use
the CPU in the meantime...
And figures on this list have confirmed that 1000Hz on x86 costs about
0.8% CPU.  You decide if that's significant or not.
