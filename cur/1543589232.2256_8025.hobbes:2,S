yes, that should work. but that means possibly updating thousands of (or
more) cached headers, which has some overhead ...

well, the method i suggested was to use sendfile() twice: first the
(cached, or freshly constructed) headers put into a big file, then the
body itself (which is the original file, accessed via cached file
descriptors).
(splitting up the header and the body has the benefit of not dual-caching
the same webcontent. this is what TUX does too.)
