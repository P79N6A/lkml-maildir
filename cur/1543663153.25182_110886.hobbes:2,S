   I'm MIYAZAWA@USAGI.
Hello Miyazawa-san, 
   This is a patch to support IPv6 IPsec on linux-2.5.62.
   It work well.
Thank you for this work.  Alexey and I will review and work with your
patch.
I must ask, have you been working together with Kunihiro Ishiguro
<kunihiro@ipinfusion.com>?  Or are you seperately doing the same work?
It would be great if these two teams worked together.  There is no
reason to duplicate effort.
All people doing work will get full credit.  The only thing
necessary is to send me patches to add credits to the comments.
So nobody needs to fear that their contribution will go unnoticed.
