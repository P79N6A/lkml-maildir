   Something like the __dma_buffer macro I posted earlier makes it even
   simpler.  I'll make a patch that adds <asm/dma_buffer.h> so we have
   something concrete to discuss.
Why don't you just allocate the "struct something" from PCI pools?
If you don't have the pci_dev from that point, make some callback into
the host adapter driver so you can get at it.
