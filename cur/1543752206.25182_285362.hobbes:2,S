Hi,
about a year ago I asked for help with my motherboard, claiming i2c bus
collisions all the time. Now I found the solution, the sensor uses the
isa bus, not the i2c. Funny it sometimes worked with i2c-viapro, but
with i2c-isa it works all the time :)
Sorry for not finding that out earlier.
Best regards,
Stian
