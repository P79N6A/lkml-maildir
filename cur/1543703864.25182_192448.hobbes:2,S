The first thing would be to get the latest alsa version (1.0.1) to work
with a 2.6 kernel (or wait for it to be integrated); so far I had no luck
either with the packaged 1.0.1 or the CVS version.
Loading the kernel version of the modules always fails with:
ALSA sound/pci/ac97/ac97_codec.c:1671: AC'97 0:0 does not respond - RESET
EMU10K1_Audigy: probe of 0000:02:04.0 failed with error -6

Based somewhere around RedHat 8 or 9, but this should not matter, apart
perhaps from the compiler, which I compiled myself: gcc 3.3.1 (also tried
gcc 2.95.3) and binutils 2.14.
