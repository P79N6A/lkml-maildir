I'm afraid a part of the problem is that there are apps which are
way too bloated. Fighting bloat is thankless and hard, so almost
everybody simply throws RAM at the problem. Well. Having thrown
lotsa RAM at the problem, it may feel 'better' until you realize you
need not only RAM but *also* disk bandwidth to move bloat from disk
to RAM and back.
Come on, lets admit it. Proper fix to 'I want OpenOffice to be
responsive' problem is to make it several times smaller.
Everything else is more or less a workaround.
It's a pity size optimizations are not too popular even
on lkml.
