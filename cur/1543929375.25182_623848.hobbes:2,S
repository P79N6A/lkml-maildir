Yes, clearly I overreacted. I actually saw the ptrace patches, but 
somehow didn't connect them with utrace which as I remember
was a much larger patch kit.  Sorry for that, Roland.
Anyways I think my original point about not delaying jump ptrace
for utrace holds still though. e.g. Markus' patches are a clear .25 
candidates, but for utrace that is probably far too late by now.
