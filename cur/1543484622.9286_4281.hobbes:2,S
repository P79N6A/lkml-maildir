I believe that you can't use ipfwadm in 2.2 any more.  2.2 has a new method
for firewall rules, etc.  You have to use ipchains instead.  ipchains is
supposed to have an (almost) one for one replacement for ipfwadm.  I think
there is another program that provides more functionality (port redirection
or something?) but ipchains does all I need so have not looked into it.
There should be documentation under Documentation.
Instead of ipfwadm -I -l try:
ipchains -L
Instead of ipfwadm -F -a accept ... try:
ipchains -A forward -j ACCEPT ...
(I think that's right, check the man page -- hey, did you upgrade all the
packages that need to be upgraded in order to move from 2.0.x to 2.2.x?
There are quite a few, and I think ipchains might be in one of them).
HTH,
Fred
