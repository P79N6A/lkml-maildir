Subject: various laptop nagles - any suggestions?   (note: 2.6.19-rc2-mm1 but applies to multiple kernels)

Setting the internal clock to 100 Hz stablizes the laptop - and the
synaptics touchpad stops "crashing"  (when "crashed" the pad reads out
all kinds of seemingly random values).   I would suspect the driver
needs adjusting for the variable clock.   Also - it's definitely nicer
on the laptop power use as far as I can tell - should this be in the
documentation?
I'm very grateful that compact flash-based booting on a SATA system
works well.   It hasn't been so reliable in 2.6.19-rc2-mm1 for IDE/CF
adaptors but I haven't yet solved why.   (tested with various laptops)
resume from "suspend to ram" (ACPI S3 mode) - the keyboard and mouse do
not recover on 945G chipset.   Note that otherwise the chipset works
well in 2.6.19-rc2-mm1 - and this is the first kernel that does work well).
LVM2 - when adding and removing physical volumes (again, on Compact
Flash cards via USB and Firewire adaptors) - it doesn't always remove
the volume properly (pvremove /dev/sda or equiv) from the device-mapper.
 This leaves me unable to plug in another.   I suspect this to be an
LVM2 problem (no hotplug?) rather than a compact flash or SCSI problem.
I would debug - but I'm not yet sure where to begin.   Feel free to
offer suggestions (to my mailbox directly - I've waited for two weeks to
post as I don't want to add noise to the kernel list)
oh - my job involves working with these systems
Thank you for everything!
