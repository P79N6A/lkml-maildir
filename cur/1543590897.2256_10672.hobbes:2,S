Hi folks,
I installed the 2.4.4 kernel on a dual P3-733 system with 1 GB of ECC RAM and found that /proc/meminfo reports back only 899MB of RAM.  The 2.4.2 kernel (with RedHat patches from the 7.1 release) worked fine as did the 2.4.0 kernel (with RedHat patches from the 7.0 release).
Anyone know what is going on with 2.4.4?  At POST, the BIOS reports 1024MB.
-Jeff
