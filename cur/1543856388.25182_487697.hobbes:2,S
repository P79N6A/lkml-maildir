Robert, thanks for taking time to look at the output.
I am not using anything on the PATA chain, other then the DVD drive --
which has sat idle during all of this.
BTW, I did have this in my config already...
CONFIG_ATA=y
CONFIG_SATA_NV=y
Thanks for the suggestion.  I can certainly disable CONFIG_IDE and try
again.
