VIA VP3/MVP3/MVP4 chipets. Put any CDROM/DVD in DMA mode and it will work
for a while and then eventually lock the PC up. This is a hardware flaw.
There is no known software workaround. This is not the ISA DMA bug either.
This is a completely different bug.
Promise Ultra66. No DMA on CDROM/DVDs. It just wont work. At all.
