Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.2: cure the kapm-idled taking (100-epsilon)% CPU time
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/3/3/85

As attachment. Don't ask me why it works. Rather, if you see why it works, I'd
like to know why :)
Patch also applies cleanly over 2.4.2-ac10.
