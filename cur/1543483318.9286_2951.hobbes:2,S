Could someone pls provide a link or description of what should/could be
done with the nsswitch.conf file. I'm a bit confused! Maybe taking this
off the list and replying to my address - jlemay@njmc.com - is the best
way. Thanks!

   no ! the right thing to do is to remove 'nis', 'nisplus' and
   'nis+' from your /etc/nsswitch.conf if you don't have a nis-server
around.
   this was discussed before !
I agree.  I think it's ludicrious to recommend that someone to add
fake and useless usernames to groups/passwd or even worse to upgrade
to a beta version of glibc to fix this problem.  I especially don't
expect it from the glibc maintainer himself.
