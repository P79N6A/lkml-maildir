For what it's worth, my Dell Latitude C840 reports this:
 hdb: TOSHIBA CD-RW/DVD-ROM SD-R2102, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
 hdb: ATAPI 24X DVD-ROM CD-R/RW drive, 2048kB Cache, UDMA(33)
So it's quite likely the same part.  Careful reading of the specs shows
that it's rated for 24x *reading*, but only 8X *writing*.  Are you *sure*
that it *actually* manages 24X writing under Windows? (Does burning a 72-minute
or 700M image take about 9 minutes (8X), or does it finish in about 3 minutes
(24X))?
