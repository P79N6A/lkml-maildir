I don't know what you mean with "medium-low code model"; I guess if it
was up to me I'd say to heck with it, and waste 1/4294967296 of the
address space as a 4 GB "null pointer check region"...
I presume the only reason you want that is to run 32-bit code/64-bit
data or something like that (shades of DOS.)
