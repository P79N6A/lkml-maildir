no, it's already that way (I changed the modules loading order at 2.6.1
time when the synaptics mouse was being stolen by usb[1]):
# cat /etc/modules
uhci-hcd
hid
agpgart
intel-agp
radeon
pcspkr
evdev
speedstep-ich
sonypi
#parport_pc
#lp
psmouse
Also, I cannot disable USB Legacy support from bios.
I'm using a sony vaio gr7/k - same chipset as
PCG-GR214EP/GR214MP/GR215MP/GR314MP/GR315MP:
# lspci | grep -i usb
0000:00:1d.0 USB Controller: Intel Corp. 82801CA/CAM USB (Hub #1) (rev 01)
0000:00:1d.1 USB Controller: Intel Corp. 82801CA/CAM USB (Hub #2) (rev 01)
0000:00:1d.2 USB Controller: Intel Corp. 82801CA/CAM USB (Hub #3) (rev 01)
the really weird things are the *This is an XFree86 bug* messages, when
xfree isn't even running. Any idea? more debug printks I might add?
thanks (please still Cc me)
