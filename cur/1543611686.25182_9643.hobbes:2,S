Yes :/  The source code is definitely uglier.  Maybe 'kstatic' would be
better on the eyes.
I just converted reiserfs and linux/kernel directories to KSTATIC.
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/patches/2.4.17/config-final-2.4.17.2.patch.gz
 
(should appear on ftp.kernel.org and mirrors soon, if not already)
Bytes saved/eliminated:
	ext2:		1135
	reiserfs:	2966
	kernel:		2578
	total:		6679 bytes saved
The conversion of linux/kernel was surprising...  I only changed two
'int' variables to KSTATIC.  That implies to me that the majority of the
space savings might simply come from the better packing created when
compiling all the files into a single .o.
I would like to also point out a nice fringe benefit:  since an entire
subsystem/driver is compiled together, you find bugs.  I have found
[tiny, unimportant] bugs in all the code I have converted to KSTATIC so
far.
