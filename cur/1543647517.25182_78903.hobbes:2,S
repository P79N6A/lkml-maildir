Hi,
So I have released a kseg1 binary kernel with its matching System.map
http://south-pole.efi.com/twiki/bin/view/Osweb/EriscDocuments
The goal here is to get a trial run on VCS so that we can get an idea of
what trace/deug output we can get.
We will have to prototype all the various minimon hooks with you guys.
Joining my lonely kernel effort, there will Ranjan and to a lesser
extent (for the time being!) Mark. Please keep them in the loop.
I'll follow up later with Eduardo and Horacio regarding the minimon
interface. Don't worry HW guys, we won't bother you  that much ;-)
Later,
