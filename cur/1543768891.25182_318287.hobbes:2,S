uml-remove-elfh looks empty.
Anyway, the real patch, of minor importance, follows in an attachment.
This is a pure bugfix, as the intention was apparent, but not carried
out, but the bug never caused exceptions or corruption. The check for
a comma following "profile=schedule" on the command line had an off by
one that caused it never to trigger. The option checking also
accidentally clobbered prof_on = SCHED_PROFILING, granted that it was
reached (which prior to dealing with that off by one, it never was).
I took the liberty of translating all of the hardcoded string length
constants to strlen(schedstr) plus the appropriate offsets for the sake
of clarity and side benefit of putting a string used only in __init in
__initdata, but left others not multiply referenced in .rodata.

profile=schedule parsing is not quite what it should be.
First, str[7] is 'e', not ',', but then even if it did fall through,
prof_on = SCHED_PROFILING would be clobbered inside if (get_option(...))
So a small amount of rearrangement is done in this patch to correct it.
