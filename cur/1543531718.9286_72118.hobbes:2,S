malloc() is not a kernel function, it's a libc function.  This
function is implemented to first try to use already available memory
from the heap space (i.e. free()d memory) or get some more heap space
if there is no chunk available that's big enough.  The relevant kernel
function for that is brk() (or mmap() for bigger chunks).  Their man
pages say nothing about "allocating memory".

The C standard isn't relevant to the Linux kernel interfaces.
