Subject: [PATCH] Interrupt entry CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/9/12/55

 On x86_64, rbp isn't saved on entering interrupt handler even when
CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER is turned on.  This breaks profile_pc()
(resulting in oops) which uses regs->rbp to track back to the original
stack.  Save full stack when CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER is specified.
