Then please fix that, no other driver has this kind of problem, right?
Are you just passing the wrong "device" to the networking subsystem?

Why would you have to do this by hand?  What makes this driver so unique
in the kernel that it would have to do this?  We have lots of other
multi-port ethernet drivers today without this issue, right?
