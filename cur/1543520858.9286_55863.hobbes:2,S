Very good to hear. :)&nbsp; I, being the know-nothing in filesystems that
I am, have looked at it a little.&nbsp; I added back the updating of inode->u.ext2_i.i_osync
in ext2_file_write (before and after generic_file_write), and I added this
into generic_file_write right after the call to write_one_page (which is
really block_write_partial_page):
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (file->f_flags &amp;&nbsp;O_SYNC)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; writeout_one_page(page);</tt>
<p>and that seems to have made some difference in the behavior, but I don't
think that it's all that's necessary.&nbsp; And, I'm not sure that it's
even right ;)
<p>Do we know when (approximately) this will be fixed?&nbsp; Also - for
the sake of current testing, could I just simulate it by doing a write()
and then a fsync() (or is it fdatasync()?) each time?&nbsp; Thanks!
