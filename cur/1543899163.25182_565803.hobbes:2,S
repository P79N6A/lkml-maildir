No, it has absolutely no effect in DMA mode.
Currently the DMA, multi-sector mode, etc. are not controllable with 
hdparm with libata. libata is designed to use the fastest settings 
possible by default. In a lot of cases this messing with hdparm was only 
needed because of stupidity with the old IDE code (like DMA not being 
automatically enabled if the low-level driver was built modular).
