Your motherboard probably has a VIA chipset. I've been chasing several of
such problems in the last weeks, and fixed most of them for the 2.4 kernel.
Unfortionatly, some PCI cards (TV capture and 3C905C) somehow don't like the
fix.
You can achieve the same effect by setting the PCI tuning in the bios to
conservative settings instead of "optimal"....
