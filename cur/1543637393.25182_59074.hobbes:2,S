Hi, Jens,
I killed the spin_lock/unlock as you directed (and made no other changes
to the tree). Result is the same as before: hard lock on partition detect.
The first time I tried it I got an oops but didn't have the serial console
up so it didn't get captured. (Stupid, stupid) Subsequent attempts have just
the hard lock with no oops.
