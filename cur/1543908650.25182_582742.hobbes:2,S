Subject: [patch 0/3] [patch 0/3] genirq: Suppress resend of level interrupts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The delayed irq disable functionality introduced a bug due to
retriggering level type interrupts in case of the delayed disable. The
resulting problem was discussed and debugged here:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=118202978609968&w=2
The resend of a level type interrupt is unnessecary and adds extra
noise to the system. Level type interrupts are resent by hardware when
they are still active at irq_enable(). The hard-/soft-ware resend is
only useful for edge type interrupts.
The following patch series addresses the problem and fixes an
unnoticed mismerge which affects the same area as well.
