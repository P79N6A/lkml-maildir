SAS will have the old SCSI advantage of multiple devices per
chain though. That is something that is very off-putting about
SATA actually that you need as many interfaces as you have
disks.
For commercial reasons, you'll probably find that the more
expensive SAS disks will be the ones with the lower seek-times,
the better warranties etc. We may not like it, but it ain't
going to change in a hurry.
