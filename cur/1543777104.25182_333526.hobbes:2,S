Hi all.
I just installed Gentoo distribution on a new PC for a friend who's
new to Linux, and discovered that although SysKonnect kindly provide
full source code drivers for their various products on their website,
that even the latest released kernel sources (i.e. 2.6.12) still don't
support the device on this motherboard (Along with a whole host of
other PCI id's that appear in the syskonnect sources).
Although it's easy enough when you fully understand what's hapening,
it a little disconcerting for the newbie user (Which my friend is)
when confronted by booting their new PC & discovereing the Linux
doesn't support their onboard ethernet card...
I've logged a bug on gentoo.org about it, but thought I'd ask, if
there's any reason that the syskonnect (sk98lin) drivers are so back
leve in the kernel sources when syskonnect seem to have published the
drivers for so many more of their devices in source...
TIA
Hamish.
