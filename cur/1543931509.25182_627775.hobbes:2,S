I can't reproduce that specific compile error, but I found & fixed a
couple of problems with your config.
BTW, I'm having a workflow problem using git to fetch your tree.  When I do:
    $ git-pull git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git mm

I haven't made any local changes and I don't want to merge anything - I
just want to get an up to date copy of your tree.  What am I missing
here?  I end up having to ssh into master.kernel.org, look at
linux-2.6-x86.git/refs/heads/mm and then do "git reset --hard XXX" from
that, which doesn't seem like the right answer...
Thanks,
