You are misunderstanding me and Linus.
The point is that your patch was singling out BK unfairly,
and the mention of CVS was an _example_ of that.
I do not support the removal of the BK docs, nor the CVS docs.
Linus does not appear to, either.
In fact, if someone wrote a general doc describing productive kernel
development under CVS, I would support the addition of that.  (though
Linus may not, since it's not vaguely equivalent to SubmittingPatches)
