What is _this_ section of code intended to do?
#ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD
        floppy_init();
#else
#if !defined (__mc68000__) && !defined(CONFIG_PPC) && !defined(__sparc__)\
    && !defined(CONFIG_APUS) && !defined(__sh__)
        outb_p(0xc, 0x3f2);
#endif
#endif
CONFIG_APUS can only be defined if CONFIG_PPC has been defined, so that's
redundant.  I _assume_ this is supposed to ACK something that the floppy
drive would have ACKed if it were configured in?  In any case, this looks
really bogus to me, and I think it would probably be better off replaced with
#if defined(CONFIG_X86) || defined (CONFIG_ALPHA) || defined (CONFIG_ARM) \
 || defined(CONFIG_MIPS) || defined (CONFIG_S390)
	outb_p(0xc, 0x3f2);
#endif
except that I would like to put a comment in here saying what it's _for_.
umm.. btw, what's the official position on CONFIG_$(ARCH) vs __$(arch)__ ?
I assume we intend to migrate towards the former?
