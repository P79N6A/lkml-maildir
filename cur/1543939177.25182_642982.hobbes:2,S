Well maybe you should change the comment to refer to an orphaned page. 
That is what Nick used. Also change the comment in truncate_complete_page. 
Anonymous page is confusing here because you check that it is *not* an 
anonymous page.

Could you move that into the corner case handling that follows?
So it would be something like
if (!page->mapping) {
	if (!PageAnon(page) && PagePrivate(page))
		try_to_relase_page(page, GFP_KERNEL);
	goto rcu_unlock;
}
