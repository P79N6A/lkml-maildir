I like the approach and will apply something like this. Comments

Missing newline.

ditto.

Why was the above was changed?
I think we've discussed this before and it would be better to add a
trigger parameter to activate/deactivate if we really need it. Anyhow,
its not part of this patch and if you want that it should be in a
separate one with accompanying rational.
Can you resend with the above fixed and I'll apply.
Thanks,
Richard
