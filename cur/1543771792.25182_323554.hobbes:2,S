Yeah, that's what I'm trying to find out.

Motherboard quirks are one thing.  Broken devices are a totally
different thing.  If there are too many of them, then the current
situation is acceptable to me.  Does ib have devices that will break
with MSI?

In looking at that, I don't see a way to get rid of the msix stuff.  So
that's probably just going to stay the same.
