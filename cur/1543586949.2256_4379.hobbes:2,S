It means it sounds like you have an older version of the driver (older here
means "not my latest patch").  I sent my stuff to Alan, and it was in the ac
series kernels, but I don't know what happened to make it into 2.4.3.  I'm
fixing one last known bug in the driver tonight, and when I'm done I'll put a
patch against 2.4.3 on my web site and drop a note here.
