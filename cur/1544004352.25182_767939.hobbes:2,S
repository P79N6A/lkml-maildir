One thing is odd:
The test app uses fork(), two processes.
One process constantly does
    msgctl(0, IPC_STAT, &buf);
The other process creates a new msg queue, then it destroys it.
But: The probablity that the new queue has the msqid is 0 is tiny 
[impossible?].
That means the idr_find() call should [must?] fail.
But then the spin_lock() should never be executed. Why do you get an 
oops in that call?
Do you still use the test app that is on bugzilla?
