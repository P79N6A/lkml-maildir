Doesn't matter, what is important is that you know the stuff.

I mean I'm using (simplified):
unsigned char vga_rseq (void *regbase, unsigned char reg)
{
        vga_w (regbase, VGA_SEQ_I, reg);
        return vga_r (regbase, VGA_SEQ_D);
}
and
void vga_wseq (void *regbase, unsigned char reg, unsigned char val)
{
#ifdef VGA_OUTW_WRITE
        vga_w_fast (regbase, VGA_SEQ_I, reg, val);
#else
        vga_w (regbase, VGA_SEQ_I, reg);
        vga_w (regbase, VGA_SEQ_D, val);
#endif /* VGA_OUTW_WRITE */
}
How do I know the following will not happen:
taskA) alpine_getsda() called from I2C subsystem
 taskB) cirrusfb_blank() called from elsewhere
taskA) vga_rseq() calls vga_w()
 taskB) vga_rseq() or _wseq() calls vga_w()
taskA) vga_r() performed with wrong index (set by taskB).
I see most of vga_[rw]seq() calls are at init/set_mode time but still
this could be a problem.
This question isn't limited to cirrusfb only, of course.

It's quite big... While I haven't investigated that, I rather thought
about some small lock for vga_rseq() and vga_wseq(). Not sure.
Another thing... How is access to VGA registers shared between
X11 and the framebuffer?
