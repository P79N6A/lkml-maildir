Yes, I agree.  However, I did the following things to try to isolate:
* ran two different drives on the controller, both returned errors
* ran the test disk (showing errors) on a pdc, and it showed no errors
* replaced the cable with a brand new in bag 80 pin 18" udma66 cable

I was always bad at seeing patterns in numbers, but to me it looked very
random.  At least even in my short example there are bit problems in each
binary column.
Thanks for your help!
