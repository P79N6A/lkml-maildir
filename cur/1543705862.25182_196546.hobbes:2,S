Well... for your own kernel hack it any way you want.
For public consumtion... I guess DMI blacklist and assume user did not
exchange cpus... We could cross-check /proc/cpuinfo.

Well, 1600MHz operation is very nice, as it has significantly less
power consumption but pretty much same performance. It also does not
start CPU fan most of the time :-).
