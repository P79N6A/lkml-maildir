Solaris Doors are similar to this. Richard Stevens' IPC book
http://www.kohala.com/~rstevens/unpv22e/unpv22e.html
 has a link to
a Linux implementation: 
http://www.rampant.org/doors
 .
Doors are like LPC (local procedure calls), except that a new thread
is created in the server (when initializing the doors mechanism), in 
which the client can run server code, with the full Unix permission
mechanism and all.
