Hi,
I've got some serious strangeness being caused by ACPI on 2.6.6.
2.6.3 works perfectly on the same machine. I don't use any acpi option on the 
kernel command line so it's just using the default options.
The first problem is that a strange device appears as eth0:
eth0      Link encap:UNSPEC  HWaddr 
00-90-F5-00-00-22-91-25-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00
          BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
          RX bytes:0 (0.0 b)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 b)
It seems to be some incarnation of the real ethernet adaptor, but even when I 
manually configure it it is unable to actually talk to the network.
I can configure the real ethernet adaptor (8139too) as eth1 with no problems.
Also, for some reason the loopback device is not added to the routing table 
which in turn causes a stack more problems.
Lots of other stuff also doesn't work including X.
But if I boot 2.6.3 or set acpi=off for 2.6.6 everything works perfectly. The 
same problems exist in 2.6.5 but I haven't tried 2.6.4.
I've attached my dmesg and .config - let me know what else is needed.
Thanks,
David.
