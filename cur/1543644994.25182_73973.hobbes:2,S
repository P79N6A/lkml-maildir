Alan-
At the risk of reading more into your suggestion than you intended...
Are you supportive of adding infrastructure into the kernel that 
provides, conceptually at least, the sort of things that Rusty and
I (and others) are after ?
Specifically...
Provide a reasonable and printk-like interface (like you've
shown above), that writes to printk if advanced logging is not 
configured; but, if advanced logging is configured... 
1)During the build process, static event details (strings,
  format specifiers, file and function name, line no)
  are stored in a .log section in .o files, so that a user-mode
  utility can extract-it into user-space templates.
2)During runtime, the printk-like interface writes the dynamic data
  into an in-kernel buffer (NOT the printk ring buffer), and a 
  user-space daemon reads the event and writes to a logfile.
3)Advanced logging utilities apply the templates from step (1)     
  when events are read from the logfile for querying and displaying
  events, event notification, and log management. Templates can be
  modified to control how data is displayed (in what language, for
  example).
Mindful  that....
1) It will take time for device drivers to migrate to a new interface
2) It will take time for exploitation of the template approach 
3) we should avoid modifying current printk behavior 
4) advanced logging must be an optional feature to avoid the overhead
   where its not wanted or needed 
5) User-space utilities already exist (evlog.sourceforge.net)
and of course, mindful that the 2.5 window is closing in 1 month.
  
Thanks,
Larry Kessler
