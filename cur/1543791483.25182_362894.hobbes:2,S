Thanks for attempting a summary of a difficult topic. I have a couple
of suggestions.

Ingo said that Xen is fine with per page granular freeing - this covers

I think that saying its now OK to use higher order allocations is wrong
because as I said even with your patches they are going to run into
problems.
Actually I think one reason your patches may perform so well is because
there aren't actually a lot of higher order allocations in the kernel.
I think that probably leaves us realistically with demand hugepages,
hot unplug memory, and IBM lpars?

This sounds like a kind of funny test to me if nobody is actually
using higher order allocations.
When a higher order allocation is attempted, either you will satisfy
it from the kernel region, in which case the vanilla kernel would
have done the same. Or you satisfy it from an easy-reclaim contiguous
region, in which case it is no longer an easy-reclaim contiguous
region.

Yasunori Goto had patches around from last year. Not sure what sort
of shape they're in now but I'd think most of the hard work is done.

You don't need to continually tune things for each and every possible
workload under the sun. It is like how we currently drive 16GB highmem
systems quite nicely under most workloads with 1GB of normal memory.
Make that an 8:1 ratio if you're worried.

To me it seems like it solves the hotplug, lpar hotplug, and hugepages
problems which seem to be the main ones.

I think it is very cool because it means the tiny minority of Linux
users who want this can do so without impacting the rest of the code
or users. This is how Linux has been traditionally run and I still
have a tiny bit of faith left :)

But we don't have the extra zones layer that anti defrag has today.
And anti defrag needs limits if it is to be reliable anyway.
