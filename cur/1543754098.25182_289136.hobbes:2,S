I am also seeing this "Badness in local_bh_enable at kernel/softirq.c:140"
message spamming my logs. It is quite scary, might I add. I have only seen
it with 2.6.11-rc2.
Aside from that, the system seems to be working fine, but I only noticed
this message for the last few hours. Before that, I run kernel 2.6.11-rc2
for 2 days straight and didn't see anything like that.
It seems to have started when I first loaded the netfilter modules. I can
provide more information. Just let me know what would be desired and I'll
try to get it.
Hope this helps, Rogério Brito.
