A little grepping gave the following result:
i386/Makefile:LDFLAGS           := -m elf_i386
m68k/Makefile:LDFLAGS := -m m68kelf
mips/Makefile:LDFLAGS           := -G 0
ppc64/Makefile:LDFLAGS          := -m elf64ppc
s390/Makefile:LDFLAGS           := -m elf_s390
s390x/Makefile:LDFLAGS          := -m elf64_s390
sh/Makefile:LDFLAGS             := -EL
sh/Makefile:LDFLAGS             := -EB
sparc/Makefile:LDFLAGS          := -m elf32_sparc
sparc64/Makefile:LDFLAGS                := -m elf64_sparc
x86_64/Makefile:LDFLAGS         := -m elf_x86_64
Little less than half of the architectures defines their own LDFLAGS.
Most of them set an emulation, most probarly inherited from i386.

I do not know, but as can be seen above several architectures use it.
I have seen your proposed patch for gnu.linkonce.
I do prefer to have it in arch/v850/Makefile because this is a workaround
for an architecture specific bug in ld.
Why not provide your own link script?
