Hmm. Please do
	dmesg | grep hdb
	hdparm -i /dev/hdb
	hdparm -I /dev/hdb
and tell us the results.
Ah, wait! I see what is wrong!
One bogus assignment has not been removed yet.
Mea culpa - I must have overlooked it when I made the 2.2.* patch.
Until 2.0.37 and since 2.3.21 we have the correct
        /* Use physical geometry if what we have still makes no sense */
        if (drive->head > 16 && id->heads && id->heads <= 16) {
                drive->cyl  = id->cyls;
                drive->head = id->heads;
                drive->sect = id->sectors;
        }
but 2.0.38 and 2.2.0pre2 - 2.2.14 have the bad
        /* Use physical geometry if what we have still makes no sense */
        if ((!drive->head || drive->head > 16) &&
            id->heads && id->heads <= 16) {
                if ((id->lba_capacity > 16514064) || (id->cyls == 0x3fff)) {
                        id->cyls = ((int)(id->lba_capacity/(id->heads * id->sectors)));
                }
                drive->cyl  = id->cyls;
                drive->head = id->heads;
                drive->sect = id->sectors;
        }
that still destroys id->cyls.
Aha! Please remove this assignment to id->cyls, and things will be much better.
(this was in ide-disk.c)
[Indeed, id->cyls is read-only and must never be changed.
The result of changing it is that afterwards id->cyls no
longer is 16383, so that lba_capacity_is_ok() fails.
You will be hit by this only if you have asked the BIOS
for a translation.]
