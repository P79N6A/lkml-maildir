Been there, done that... and unfortunately, my WOP35 insist on
taking first 6 bytes as PS/2->ImPS/2 sequence, and rest as normal
DPI settings. I tried it in reverse order, and couple of permutations,
but it still returns ExPS/2 id. I tried also other sequences from
gm_psauxprint-0.01, but I found nothing interesting, except that
mouse definitely does not support MS PNP id.
Answer from A4Tech support was that mouse is not supported under Linux,
and that I should use Windows and verify that mouse is properly connected.
So I'm on the best way to the command line switch, I think. Google
find couple of problem reporters, but nobody found detection method :-(
