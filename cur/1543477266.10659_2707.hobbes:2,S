After reading what he had to say, I also came to the conclusion that he
has some idea on what he's talking about.... But.. I dont understand how
he can make such rational comments about Linux (and some of his comments 
are relevent to many other unixes) in one breath and recommend NT in the
next. Perhaps he's just been an academia too long? :) NT in the
enterprise? Pffth.
