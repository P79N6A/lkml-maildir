Non-technical comments:
1) Please send drivers/net patches to me and netdev@oss.sgi.com
2) Consider using the bk-make-sum script (in Documentation/BK-usage/) to 
generate your summary.  This will add a "bk pull " prefix to your BK url 
particularly, making it even easier to cut-n-paste.
3) Please include a patch in your submission so that list readers may 
review your changes, not just the BK users.
Technical comments:
1) Accepted, I pulled it into my netdev-2.6 queue
2) in your implementation of tun_get_drvinfo(), it may be nice to 
include the tun/tap interface number in info->bus_info, to differentiate 
between multiple tun interfaces or multiple tap interfaces.
3) You might consider moving tun_set_msglevel() completely inside 
TUN_DEBUG ifdef.
4) use of MODULE_VERSION() is recommended
