Hello,
We have released libsysfs v0.3.0 as part of the sysfsutils package.
The package can be downloaded from 
http://linux-diag.sourceforge.net/
Changes include:
	* Support for the "block" subsystem. Block now is 
		considered as a sysfs "class".
	* Facility to build both shared and static libraries
	* Fixed "write" attribute support.
	* Added few "test" routines to demonstrate API usage.
	* Headers now get installed to /usr/include/sysfs
	* PCI name decode support.
Comments, suggestions and contributions welcome. The mailing list 
for discussing libsysfs and other diagnostic utilities is
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/linux-diag-devel
Thanks,
Ananth
