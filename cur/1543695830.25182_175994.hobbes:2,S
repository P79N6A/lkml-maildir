APM working here nicely with -test9 on Thinkpad A31. Stilling getting
1394 badness when suspending/resuming with my cardbus 1394 controller
plugged in. Other than that, works pretty seamlessy with no cardbus
cards plugged.
Even radeon with VESA suspend/resume, DRI and X 4.3 (using some
precarious vtswitch calls in /etc/apm/event.d/). wlan-ng works okay
although it requires rmmod/modprobe to wake up properly after resume.

Hmmm, well for me; a working APM (here) is much prefered to non-
working ACPI suspend/resume. I'd prefer not to obsolete APM until
there is a working alternative (with mature userspace tools).
