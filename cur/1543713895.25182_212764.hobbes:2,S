Hi,
I'm having some problems with my Dual Pentium Pro 200 MHz box; It stops
decompressing the kernel and hangs if I have no keyboard attached to it.
If a keyboard is attached, everything works ok. Has anyone else seen
anything like this, and if so, how can this be fixed?
Relevant information:
Dual Pentium Pro 200 MHz on a Micronics W6-Li board.
Kernel 2.6.3 (but will try later versions)
384 MB of ECC RAM
If you need any more information, dmesg output or otherwise,
let me know and I'll provide.
Hope someone can help me out,
Bas Vermeulen
