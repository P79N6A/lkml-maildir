Subject: [PATCH] lance.c - dev_kfree_skb() then reference skb->len
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Greetings all,
Patch is against 2.2.17, drivers/net/lance.c.
I believe this to be "obviously correct," but please correct me if I'm
wrong.
This moves a reference to skb->len to before the possible
dev_kfree_skb(skb) call.  Though it appears to work as is, I suspect it
is incorrect.
Please apply or let me know why.
Eli
ps.  It's an attachment rather than inline because I can't seem to get
Netscape (4.71) to do that without replacing tabs with spaces.  Grr.
