I don't intend to try to force somebody to do it, if
they have more important things to do.

It surely would be nice to prevent all DoS attacks. But
of course that would require a lot of work. However I
think most other DoS attacks could be solved by a reboot.

We cannot blame administrators before the documentation
has been changed.
