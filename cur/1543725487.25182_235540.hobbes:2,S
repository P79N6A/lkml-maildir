Hmm... I'm not sure how I missed that (probably by misreading the
local_irq_enable() that comes after it as a local_bh_enable()).

It'd be nice to use locks that only exclude the specific regions in
the softirqs that are needed, but that's a lot to change at this
point...

If every such loop in every softirq is taken care of, that would work
(though only until someone adds a new softirq that forgets to check
for preemption).  I don't see any such checks in either the transmit
or receive network softirqs in vanilla 2.6.7, though (are they in a
patch, or am I overlooking them?), much less in each individual
driver.  There are checks for excessive work (where "excessive" is
not well defined in terms of actual time), but none for need_resched()
except in a few isolated places.
