There must be a ton of odd stuff going on.  "showkey" used to say that the
scan code is 0x7d not 0x6a, but now it displays weird stuff.  As previously
mentioned, "getkeycodes" displays a table which seems far removed from
reality.  But the patch from junkio@cox.net worked (but "showkey" and
"getkeycodes" still produce weird output).
