OK, how about wider testing? Theory: prune_dcache() goes through the
list of immediately killable dentries and tries to free given amount.
It has a "one warning" policy - it kills dentry if it sees it twice without
lookup finding that dentry in the interval. Unfortunately, as implemented
it stops when it had freed _or_ warned given amount. As the result, memory
pressure on dcache is less than expected.
