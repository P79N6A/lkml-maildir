Please stop spreading bullshit.  Calling convetions can change all the
time.  The kernel only exports a C API and not ABI at all to modules.
And even the API is rather volatile and can change with every release.
Just because you're too much of a dickhead to work with others on the
inkernel crypto implementation we don't have to care about your unsupported
out of tree code.
