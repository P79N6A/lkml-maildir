Yes the granularity issue has nothing to do with SMP (with preemptive kernel
it can trigger even without interrupts involved into the code). Also
CONFIG_SPACE_EFFICIENT looks not necessary.
The x8 name is confusing IMHO (when I read `8' I expect 8bits only, the x
isn't explicit enough). But by using a better name we could save some byte on
alpha ev6 and x86. Something like granular_char/granular_short/granular_int
looks nicer.  For the generic 64bit cpu they needs to be _unconditionally_
defined to `long'.
BTW, only old chips (ev[45]) doesn't provide byte granularity. Infact a linux
kernel compiled for ev6 can handle byte granularity also on alpha (it uses
-mcpu=ev6).
alpha reference manual 5.2.2:
	[..] For each region, an implementation must support aligned quadword
	access and may optionally support aligned longword access or byte
	access. If byte access is supported in a region, aligned word access
	and aligned longword access are also supported. [..]
21264hrm:
	[..] The 21264-generated external references to memory space are
	always of a fixed 64-byte size, though the internal access granularity
	is byte, word, longword, or quad-word. [..]
