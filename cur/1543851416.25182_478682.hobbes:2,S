git-format-patch can make a patch file for each commit in range, each
prefixed with a four digit patch number and named similarly to patches
in -mm:
    git format-patch -o <dir> <from>..<to>
For example:
    0009-DM-kill-bogus-uninit-warning.txt
    0010-drivers-net-drivers-net-Silence-more-bogosities.txt
    0011-debug-shared-irqs.txt
    0012-debug-shared-irqs-kconfig-fix.txt
    0013-make-frame_pointer-default-y.txt
It can also produce an mbox mailbox:
    git format-patch --stdout <from>..<to>
I've used this second form in combination with a 'mailbomb' exploder to
extract the patches with a series file.
