Of course it is!  Not only the procedure call prevents code optimisations
like immediate constants for opcode arguments and pushes more registers to
the stack, but you're then wasting many CPU cycles that would have been much
useful to fetch data from the peripheral's fifo.
Remember we are talking about "embedded" platforms which the majority are
using small CPUs where the IO bus is often on a clock which is tightly 
coupled to the CPU core clock.  Extra CPU cycles wasted on function call 
prologs is often enough to affect throughput significantly.
