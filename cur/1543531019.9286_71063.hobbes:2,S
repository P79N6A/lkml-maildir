Only if management has said they won't run their jobs. I work in an environment
that schedules large job runs. Sorry in this you miss the boat.

I said one area - that area covers:
   1. E-commerce servers
   2. banking and accounting
   3. medical data bases
   4. Stock market servers
   5. large scientific/enginerring simulation
   6. corporate disk servers
This actually covers the majority of the use of computers. I don't care
if they are also served by failure prone systems now. I don't want them
to fail.
THEY SHOULD NOT FAIL.
