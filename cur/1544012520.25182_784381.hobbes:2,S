Hi Jesse,
The following two patches contain fixes of PCI suspend-resume routines.
The first one corrects the suspend-resume handling for PCI Express ports after
commit 2bdc985ac3fcdb4ae9672feeb14de2c525967899 (in your tree).
The second one is a fix for devices without PM capability.
Sorry for being late with them, but I had to make sure that the first patch
doesn't break the test box affected by bug #12121 again.
Thanks,
Rafael
