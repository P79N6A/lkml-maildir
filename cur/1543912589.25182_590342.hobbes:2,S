The problem is not filesystem block size, it's the xfs inode cluster buffer
size / the size of the inodes that determines the lock depth. the common case
is 8k/256 = 32 inodes in a buffer, and they all get looked during inode
cluster writeback.
This inode writeback clustering is one of the reasons XFS doesn't suffer from
atime issues as much as other filesystems - it doesn't need to do as much I/O
to write back dirty inodes to disk.
IOWs, we are not going to make the inode clusters smallers - if anything they
are going to get *larger* in future so we do less I/O during inode writeback
than we do now.....
Cheers,
Dave.
