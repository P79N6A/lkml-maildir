Let me jump in here, real quickly, and just on the matter of broken
TSC's...
	There are two (known) cases of these:
	1) On Cyrix/IBM/Centaur the TSC will stop if Suspend-on-Halt is
           enabled and a HLT is executed.  This is usually a very good
           thing since power comsuption goes down dramatically, but
           the time code has to compensate (and does since somewhere in
           2.1.12x).
	2) A machine that does a suspend-to-disk or similar, where the CPU
           is actually shutdown.  TSC will reset.  This can happen on any
           x86 that does APM.
This is why, IMHO, is not a good idea for other parts of the kernel to use
the TSC directly as a time measure, but instead go through gettimeofday(). 
The time code should take care of the above.
	Cheers,
