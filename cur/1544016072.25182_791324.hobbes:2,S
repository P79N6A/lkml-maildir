Hi!
I tried to use ext2+ -osync, and was surprised that my data do not hit
the (SATA) disk. Fortunately I soon realized that I need hdparm -W0
/dev/sda.
Could the ext2 be teached to use barriers? -W0 hurts performance more
than neccessary...
Plus it has a nasty behaviour where it reverts to -W1 if disk
connection is momentarily lost. (If you unplug/replug SATA disk, linux
will happily rediscover and use it, but -W0 was already forgotten at
that point, right?)
