Sau Dan Lee's Lifebook touchscreen ;) The data processing seems to be
trivial, but I don't have any idea how to detect it. And without being
able to explicitly control binding for a specific serio port its hard
to do drivers for hardware that we can't autodetect. We just have to
assume that device behind a port is of specific type and when there
are many ports its usually wrong.
