Think of it this way... two threads are blocked on different resources...
The currently executing thread reaches a point where it blocks.
    OS threads:
        1) thread#1 invokes a system call
        2) OS switches tasks to thread#2 and returns from blocking
    user-space threads:
        1) thread#1 invokes a system call
        2) thread#1 returns from system call, EWOULDBLOCK
        3) thread#1 invokes poll(), select(), ioctl() to determine state
        4) thread#1 returns from system call
        5) thread#1 switches stack pointer to be thread#2 upon determination
           that the resource thread#2 was waiting on is ready.
Certainly the above descriptions are not fully accurate, or complete,
and it is possible that the M:N threading would make a fair compromise
between OS thread sand user-space threads, however, if user-space threads
requires all this extra work, and M:N threads requires some extra work,
some less work, and extra book keeping and system calls, why couldn't
OS threads by themselves be more efficient?
