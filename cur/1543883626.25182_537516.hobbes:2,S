Please note that there are ways to replace a bad maintainer. 
We still try to keep it polite.
But note that you can't have someone "fired", no matter how bad they
do their job.  A bad maintainer is usually better than none - the bad
maintainer might improve. Or at least get some simple stuff done.
You therefore replace a bad maintainer by taking over the position. 
Contact whoever is above the maintainer (Linus or some other
higher-level maintainer). You explain the problem, and you must also
show that you have the time and knowledge to do a better job. 
You can, for example, maintain the same subsystem in parallel.  After a 
while,
all interested parties sees that your tree works better and that
communicating with you is easier.
If you aren't prepared to do this - then you have to live with the current
maintainer.  There is no staff ready to replace maintainers after
complaints, a volunteer doing a better job is always necessary.
