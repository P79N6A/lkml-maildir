Well, while it would be a good option to have, I'm not sure it's a
good idea to make it the default. If you flush the buffer+page caches,
then later you will need to repopulate them. That will require
*random* disc activity (i.e. head seeks all over the place).
Contrast that to suspend-to-disc which uses a single contiguous
section.
What would be nicer is if when you suspend, you record the cached
block numbers (and then flush+clear the caches), and on resume kick
off a daemon/kernel thread which touches those blocks, bringing them
back into the caches. Rate-limit the daemon so that "urgent"
(i.e. what the user needs *now*) I/O is only marginally affected.
And since that daemon has time to repopulate, it can re-order the I/O
to avoid head seeks.
Such a scheme I would like to be the default.
