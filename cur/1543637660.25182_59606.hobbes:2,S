UML has been updated to 2.5.29 and UML 2.4.18-46.  The changes since 2.5.28
are mostly cleanups.  The one major change, the Honeypot procfs, is not
present in this patch because I haven't yet figured out how to port filesystems
from 2.4.
Since UML didn't make 2.5.28, I'll be sending this patch in to Linus.
The patch is available at
