Once I modularized xfs and switched to using an initrd, the problem
disappeared.
I just noticed a difference between the kernel messages with XFS
built-in and with it modularized. I'm having trouble putting my finger
on it; it seems like the screen gets cleared at some point during
resume, and with XFS built-in, it starts reading the data from swap
*after* the screen gets cleared. In contrast, if the enable-initrd patch
is removed or XFS is modularized, it reads in from swap *before* the
screen gets cleared. Or something like that.
I'll see if I can get anything more detailed & useful with a serial
console... Failing that, I'll try a camcorder or digital camera and
transcribe from that.
