Subject: Oops report for the week upto Feb 10th 2008
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The 
http://www.kerneloops.org
 website collects kernel oops and
warning reports from various mailing lists and bugzillas as well as
with a client users can install to auto-submit oopses.
Below is a top 10 list of the oopses/backtraces collected in the last 7 days.
(Reports prior to 2.6.23 have been omitted in collecting the top 10)
This week, a total of 323 oopses and warnings have been reported,
compared to 110 reports in the previous week.
(This sharp increase is due to Fedora 9 alpha shipping the oops data
collection client in the default install, giving us much wider coverage
in the issues that actual users hit; many thanks to the Fedora project
for this)
With the 2.6.25-rc1 release out, this will be the last report that includes
2.6.23; future reports will only include issues from 2.6.24 and later.
Rank 1: set_dentry_child_flags
	WARN_ON at fs/inotify.c:172 set_dentry_child_flags
	Reported 93 times (116 total reports)
	This is a user triggered WARN_ON in inotify. Sadly inotify seems to be unmaintained.

Rank 2: __ieee80211_rx_handle_packet
	WARN_ON at net/mac80211/rx.c:1704 __ieee80211_rx_handle_packet
	Reported 35 times (82 total reports)
	This is the well known packet alignment issue; fix in progress

Rank 3: remove_proc_entry
	WARN_ON at fs/proc/generic.c:736
	Reported 20 times (38 total reports)
	This WARN_ON is there if code tries to remove a non-empty /proc directory.
	Most reports are tainted, pointing at a bug in a binary module.
	Without the WARN_ON improvements from 2.6.25-rc1 it'll be hard to figure out which module is guilty.

	WARN_ON at lib/iomap.c:44
