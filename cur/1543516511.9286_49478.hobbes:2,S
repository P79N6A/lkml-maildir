Sorry for bothering the list once again with my humble suggestion but coming
back to ClearCase: why not implement the concept of a view:
1. You specify a set of rules which say which file is seen if there is a
conflict.
2. In the case discussed here you also specify where to write. 
On mount these are read by a daemon and the kernel shovels all file I/O to this
daemon into user-space. The daemon goes through 1 and 2 and does the actual
file I/O. 
May be rather slow but very flexible. And accomodates for all subcases - union
filesystem, transparrent mounts, versioned filesystems, etc. 
Per-user functions can be implemented via preload libraries.
