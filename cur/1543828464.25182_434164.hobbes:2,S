There's actually a philosophical question hiding here over what's the
right thing to do with how st_blksize should be handled over NFS ---
st_blksize is supposed to be the "optimum I/O size"; the question is
what is the right answer that we report in both directions.  For
example, it doesn't matter if we're exporting a Ultra Fast whiz-bang
cluster filesystem with a stripsize of 100 gigabytes.  If wsize is
1024, it might be that we shouldn't be sending back an st_blksize
that's really big.
So I'm not pretending that what we have in the patch is the right
thing, only that I'm not entirely sure we were ever doing the right
thing here.
