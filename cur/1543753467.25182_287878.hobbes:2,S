Subject: [PATCH 0/12] random pt3: More core and accounting cleanups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is a third series of various cleanups for drivers/char/random.c.
It applies on top of the previous 10.
These bits greatly simplify the setup:
1  More meaningful pool names
2  Static allocation of pools
3  Static sysctl bits
These bits make the accounting safer and the code easier to follow:
4  Catastrophic reseed checks
5  Entropy reservation accounting
6  Reservation flag in pool struct
7  Reseed pointer in pool struct
8  Break up extract_user
These bits clean up the hashing functions:
9  Remove dead MD5 copy
10 Simplify hash folding
11 Clean up hash buffering
This bit drops a bunch of code and reduces lock hold times:
12 Remove entropy batching
The next series focuses on moving and sharing code more appropriately.
