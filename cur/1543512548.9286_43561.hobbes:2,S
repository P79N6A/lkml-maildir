How about the fact that to solve all the problems it solves you require
many individual solutions. Not the way to go in an OS, where races and
locking issues run rampant. The fact is, devfs skirts many issues, not
only fixing them, but every so gracefully removing the problem by not
doing device management in a way that caused the problem in the first
place.

Which, pray tell?

Obviously.

Ok, Mr gcc, just exactly how is security affected? Instead
of making baseless allegations, please cite fact, at least
at a fundamental level.

Now you insult Richard. You haven't even looked at the patch, or the FAQ.
