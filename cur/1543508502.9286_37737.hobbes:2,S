Sorry I was referring to your loop_rand which was keeping IVs secret.
I'm not sure a hash of device/file is sufficiently random, but if that
is introduced you still get a dependency on the location/name of the
backing store.  However, if #2 is implemented, people can do whatever
they want.  I think _I_ would prefer something like the following in a
nice wrapping:
# dd if=/dev/urandom of=backingfile bs=32 count=1
# IV=`dd if=backingfile bs=32 count=1 | od -tx -w32 | ...`
# losetup -e serpent -o 512 -iv $IV /dev/loop0 backingfile
