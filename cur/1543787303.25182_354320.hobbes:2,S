Does this occur during resume from disk?  Most likely the controller was
enabled by the BIOS.  Try passing the "usb-handoff" parameter to the boot
kernel when you resume.

I think that calling free_irq during suspend is a good thing in general, 
for the reason Adam Belay mentioned: It reduces interrupt overhead for 
runtime power management, where a few devices may be suspended while the 
rest of the system stays awake.
Of course, that doesn't mean I advocate going around right away and adding 
those free_irq/request_irq pairs to every driver.
