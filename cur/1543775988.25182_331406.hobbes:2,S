   CC [M]  sound/pci/bt87x.o
sound/pci/bt87x.c: In function `snd_bt87x_detect_card':
sound/pci/bt87x.c:807: error: `driver' undeclared (first use in this function)
sound/pci/bt87x.c:807: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
sound/pci/bt87x.c:807: error: for each function it appears in.)
sound/pci/bt87x.c: At top level:
sound/pci/bt87x.c:910: error: `driver' used prior to declaration
make[2]: *** [sound/pci/bt87x.o] Error 1
Substituting driver with pci->driver seems to cure it, it this the 
correct fix?
