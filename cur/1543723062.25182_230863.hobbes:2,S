That's true.  But if one were to propose such a feature to the gcc
guys, I know the first question they would ask.  "If no padding of
the structure is needed, why are you specifying this new
__nopadding__ attribute?"
I think it's bad to just "smack this attribute onto any structure that
_MIGHT_ need it on some platform"  I never do that in my drivers,
and they work on all platforms.  For example, if you have a simple
DMA descriptor structure such as:
	struct txd {
		u32 dma_addr;
		u32 length;
	};
It is just total and utter madness to put a packed or the proposed
__nopadding__ attribute on that structure.  Yet this seems to be
what was suggested now and at the beginning of this thread.
