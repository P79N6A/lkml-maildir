To do that I'd have to go back, take the time to re-read the GPLv3 *in* 
*depth*, think about each paragraph of each section individually...
Like I said, I just got a general impression that a lawyer would have a 
field-day with it.

Sorry, bad choice of words. There are "guarantees" encoded into every license. 
There are some encoded into the GPLv3 that aren't encoded into the GPLv2. You 
can't remove or restrict those guarantees without violating the license. And 
removing those guarantees would be the only way to make the GPLv3 fully 
compatible with the GPLv2.

In this case I wasn't speaking literally. I should have been a lot more 
specific there - it should say "practically impossible".
