If it is not expected behaviour that the kernel processes no longer 
close their fds open an pivot_root, then I'd like to debug this (is my 
use of pivot_root correct or am I doing something wrong here ?). I will 
try with vanilla 2.4.21 now and see how that goes (or should I rather 
try 2.4.22-pre7 ?).
However, I'd like to use your tree on that machine because of the 
support for VIA chipsets (it's a VIA EPIA M-6000).
Thanks for the notice that it should not have changed,
Rene
