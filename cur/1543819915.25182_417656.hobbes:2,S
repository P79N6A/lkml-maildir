Thanks for showing me this section!  I wish I saw it before I submitted
patches to MadWifi, HostAP and linux-wlan-ng makefiles.  Now I know how
to fix all that mess.

I agree with your sentiment, and I'm trying to fix it.
However, the problem with "make install" creating .tmp_versions owned by
root still exists.  Can we settle on removing only *.mod files
under .tmp_versions without removing the directory?
Removing .tmp_versions does nothing if the goal is to remove stale *.mod
files.
