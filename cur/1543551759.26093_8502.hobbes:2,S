Pinning using map_user_kiobuf looks just the other way around of what we do
usually with the mmap callback of the device driver and remap_page_range.  I
considered "pinning" just to convert the user page to one of the pages mapped
with remap_page_range so they can threat them in the same way internally in the
device driver (and the ones mapped with remap_page_range don't get unmapped
and then into swap of course).

So just delete map_user_kiobuf from your tree if people shouldn't do it. That
would fix the mm corruption too indeed. I don't see why you provide that
functionality and then you keep telling people not to use it. Also rawio
and networking could use the other way around. I think that's mainly a
matter of API. People is used to think in read/write terms. And infact rawio
doesn't provide a completly transpartent read/write because it have constrants
on the buffer alignment.
If you won't delete map_user_kiobuf from your tree I think I've just provided a
real world MM corruption case where the user send the bug report back to us if
we only increase the reference count of the page to pin it.
