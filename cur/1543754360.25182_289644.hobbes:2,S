 One more question about NLS modules. In the beginning of every module
code i see comment which says that this file is automatically generated
from data found at unicode.org. Where can i find a convertor and what
data can it use as unput? I explored unicode.org and found some
conversion data at oss.software.ibm.com/icu/. The data is available in
UCM and XML formats. Are those files suitable?
