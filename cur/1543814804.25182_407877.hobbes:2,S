unshare_sighand() is ok, it never populates *new_sighp, it just returns
errror code: 0 when ->sighand is not shared, EINVAL otherwise.
I argued about 'if (new_sigh)' code in sys_unshare() because it lies about
locking rules.
Btw, copy_process() forbids CLONE_SIGHAND without CLONE_VM (is there a
good reason for that?), but one can do unshare(CLONE_VM). This is odd.
