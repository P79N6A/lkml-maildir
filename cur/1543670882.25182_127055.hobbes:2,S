I'll try to put stripped down matroxfb into kernel sometime in future...
Unfortunately as 2.5.x fbdev infrastructure does not fullfill my needs,
it will be stripped down version (which fits into current fbdev, and
which will not support text mode & fbset -fb /dev/tty*), and I'll not 
test it a lot, as it is hard to test something you cannot use in daily 
work...
