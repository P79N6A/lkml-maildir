Agreed.  I am actually amazed that the opposite of what is happening
does not happen -- that more people aren't clamoring for this solution.
Six months ago I was testing some TCP application and by accident placed
a sendto() in an infinite loop.  The destination of the packets (on my
LAN) locked up completely!  And this was a powerful Pentium III with a
3c905 NIC.  Not acceptable.
