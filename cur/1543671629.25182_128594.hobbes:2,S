Many open source projects start out as entirely new ideas, but 
admittedly, they then taken on an entirely evolutionary (rather than 
revolutionary) approach to improvement afterwards.  The theoretical 
advantage is that global revolutionary change can occur through fast 
enough evolution.  Is Linux 2.5.68 revolutionarily better than Linux 
1.2?  I'd say so, but it got there through evolutionary, incremental change.
Keep in mind that evolution itself is driven by lots of 
mini-revolutions.  So when Ingo developed his O(1) scheduler, he 
completely replaced the existing one.  Sure he borrowed ideas, but that 
always happens.  The point is that the old one was ripped out and a new 
one was inserted.  An incremental change for Linux was caused by a 
revolutionary change to the process scheduler.
The idea of an O(1) scheduler may not be revolutionary in the grand 
scheme of all of computer science.  But that doesn't make it any less 
important to us or any less useful to the world.
Sometimes, the evolution just doesn't happen fast enough.  GNOME and KDE 
will both get there... eventually.  But they're not fast enough to make 
Linux viable yet on the desktop.  I can't begin to tell you how much 
effort it's taken for me to get Blue Curve and other GNOME-oriented or 
Red Hat-oriented (I know the difference) stuff with RH9 to behave the 
way I want it to.  Actually, it still doesn't.
