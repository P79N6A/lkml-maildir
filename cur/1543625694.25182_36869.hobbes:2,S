  Person X subscribed address X' on the list, then set  .forward
  to the victim V, who chose rather nasty ways to "fight back".
  Lots of noice, very little data to help remove him.  When I
  asked specific questions directly from V, I got usefull data
  back to find the address X', though.
  How we knew who the V was ?  He called (by phone, it seems)
  Transmeta Hostmaster ("whois kernel.org") to complain and threaten
  (in good American Way),  not believing when he was referred to
  postmaster@vger.kernel.org, nor ever sending email to ask assistance
  from  postmaster@vger.kernel.org ...  Transmeta Hostmaster sent
  Cc/Bcc to vger's postmaster, and the V did answer when I asked
  him a bit of data to help me to hunt the route.
  The V did (amazingly enough) try to interact with majordomo, which
  naturally didn't find V's address in any list...
  Folks:  If you ever have hard time with VGER's Majordomo, do
  ask assistance from VGER's Postmaster(s).  Majordomo is rather
  stupid piece of software, we humans (try to) be a bit smarter.
  Of course FAQ-questions get referral to:
