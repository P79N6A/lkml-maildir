This morning I reported an issue which cause a failure of the
2.6.23-rc2-git4 kernel to boot on my system.  The contents of my post
may be viewed here:

After 3 separate builds from "virgin sources" I still had the boot
failure with the git4 level kernel.
This afternoon I picked up the git5 patch and it comes up and appears to
run without problem.
Same base system.  Same hardware.  Same build process.
So even though I have only been building and running "pre-release"
kernels for a short time I feel confident in saying that something was
not kosher with the git4 patch - at least when it came to my system.
(system configuration data is in the original post)
I would not normally burn the valuable time of others with a rhetorical
post but I looked at the changes out into the git5 patch and did not
spot anything that looked like it would have resolved the issue I was
having and I hate not being  able to correlate a cause and effect here.
Any clues, or did I just get lucky with this one?
