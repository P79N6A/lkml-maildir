That's a gross exaggeration.  FLUSH CACHE and FUA both ensure data 
integrity as well.
Turning write cache off has always been a performance-killing action on ATA.

All of that can be fixed with an Adaptec firmware upgrade, so not our 
problem here, and not a reason to disable NCQ in libata core.

Real world testing disagrees with you.  NCQ has been enabled for a while 
now.  We would have screaming hordes of users if the majority of 
configurations were problematic.
