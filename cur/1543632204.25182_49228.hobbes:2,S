A small request to add to the list:
Current 2.4.x kernels build (at least on x86) with
     -nostdinc -I /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-mandrake-linux-gnu/3.0.4/include
added to CFLAGS...  IMOit is a good idea in general to build all kernel 
code this way.  (note that userland programs created during build should 
not use this rule, of course)
