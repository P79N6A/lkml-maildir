The SCSI midlayer is the most obvious one. The Sangoma drivers could do
with a diet, the floppy driver seems to be horribly bloated for what is does -
tho that might be partly the hardware's fault.
I think there are quite a few driver candidates and some non driver ones
- lack of page colouring, the DMA memory issue, the amount of work done when
picking pages to swap. None of these last ones are trivial items though.
