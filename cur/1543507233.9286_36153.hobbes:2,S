I am building a machine that must read sequentially vast amounts of
data from disk.  I am looking for recommendations to get good
performance at reasonably low cost:
I am wondering about the ultra ide 66 vs. scsi.
I am also wondering about raid0.  Does raid0 help with ide
performance?
Any user-level programming tips?
