psmouse_probe() is very similar in its use, as are a lot of other
functions in the serio framework - and they return 0 on success, and -1
on failure.
I see it as "detected/initialized" = success (0) and "not detected / failed
to initialize" = fail (-1).
I agree that your view also makes sense, however I'd like to keep the
driver return values consistent to make it easier to read.
Maybe renaming the *_detect functions to *_probe would make it more
obvious.
