Hm, this is just wrong.  As I recall, LANANA is in charge of the major
numbers, but for the USB major, the USB developers have been assigning
the USB minors.  This patch just made the file different from what is
currently present in the kernel.
Should I just submit a patch to LANANA to update the USB minors for
their copy so this doesn't happen again?
I'll also fix this up in mainline in the next round of USB patches...
thanks,
