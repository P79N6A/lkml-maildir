That's right, the x86_64 (and the ia64) do_boot_cpu() functions (called
when onlining a cpu) do a check on current_is_keventd(): commented thus
 * During cold boot process, keventd thread is not spun up yet.
 * When we do cpu hot-add, we create idle threads on the fly, we should
 * not acquire any attributes from the calling context. Hence the clean
 * way to create kernel_threads() is to do that from keventd().
 * We do the current_is_keventd() due to the fact that ACPI notifier
 * was also queuing to keventd() and when the caller is already running
 * in context of keventd(), we would end up with locking up the keventd
 * thread.
though I've not tried to think that through.

I don't see which part of the description you disagree with, but please
do improve it if you can.  The actual trace (when powersaved was saving
power by onlining a cpu I'd tried to exclude with maxcpus=1 ;) was this:
 BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000001] code: powersaved/3368
 caller is current_is_keventd+0x9/0x3d
