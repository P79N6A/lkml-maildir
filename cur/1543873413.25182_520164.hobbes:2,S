The reason I chose the loop device was the following:
The loop device has backing storage and makes use of the page cache. The 
nopage method for all block device files and most disk files is 
implemented by filemap_nopage. This function uses the page cache. Thus, 
this allows me to mmap a large address space.
If I wrote a character device, I would have to store the contents in 
kernel memory as the function filemap_nopage is not suitable for character 
devices. This would severly restrict the size of my mmap.
I am out my depth here, any pointers on how to proceed would be very 
helpful
