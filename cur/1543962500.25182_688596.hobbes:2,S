Subject: [git head] Should X86_PAT really default to yes?

With X86_PAT enabled, when X is started I get about 40 lines (with varying 
addresses) like:
kernel: Xorg:3358 /dev/mem expected mapping type write-back for 
807bf000-81000000, got uncached-minus
And when X exits I get a bunch of lines like:
kernel: Xorg:3349 freeing invalid memtype 80020000-8002a000
I also noticed artifacts (a band of about 2 cm high across the screen) after 
X goes to black but before the switch to VT1.
When I unset X86_PAT all this disappeared.
Apparently this has been seen before:

Is this a bug in PAT or not. If it is, should PAT really be recommended to 
be enabled by default?
