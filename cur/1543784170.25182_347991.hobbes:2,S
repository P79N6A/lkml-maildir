hwgroups and IDE locking requirements are frequently completely
unrelated. Its clear from the changes proposed you've not tested on real
hardware for each case and you have not studied the documented errata
even for the controllers that are publically specified. This is peoples
data you are endangering, not just risking the odd crash.

You could start by fixing the real locking bugs. Or at least trying to
get known fixes past the maintainer and going from there.
