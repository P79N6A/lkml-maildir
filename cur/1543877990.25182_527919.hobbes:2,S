A 4MB chunk of page structs covers about 512MB of ram (I'm rounding up
to 64-bytes in my calculations and using an 8K page size, sorry :-).
So I think that is too small although on the sparc64 side that is the
biggest I have available on most processor models.
But I do agree that 64MB is way too big and 16MB is a good compromise
chunk size for this stuff.  That covers about 2GB of ram with the
above parameters, which should be about right.
