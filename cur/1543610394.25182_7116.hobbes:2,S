Yeah. While the welcome message has a link to the FAQ, that doesn't
help for people who post without subscribing.

That would be easy to do with the WWW pages on www.kernel.org. Is that
what you had in mind?
However, you can easily end up with a growing list of "hotlinks" into
the FAQ, as someone decides some piece of information is really
important. As soon as you have one hotlink, you open the door for
many. Besides, the FAQ *does* have a contents list (with links).
People should be using that.
Ultimately, there's only so much you can do against human laziness.
I know, because I'm lazy too :-) I'd rather fiddle with the controls
of a new VCR than read the manual, or type "make" before reading the
README.
