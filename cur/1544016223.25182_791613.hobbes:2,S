When I 'cat' trace_bprintk_formats on my system the file is empty. This
seems to be b/c 'ftrace_bprintk' is not being used in this patchset. It
can't be used in patch #5 during marker register b/c the format wouldn't
be known at runtime. Thus, as it currently stands this patch, patch 4/5,
isn't adding much?
A thought on how this might be resolved would be to have the core marker
code pass us its address so this could be recorded in the trace buffer.
Then, also add some debug file that displays the markers and maps marker
addresses with format strings.
