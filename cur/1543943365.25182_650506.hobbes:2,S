The -stable releases mirror what is in the upstream kernel trees, so I'd
like to keep these the same for now, if at all possible.
I'd also like to have users hardware at least work today, which this
patch does, instead of forcing them to wait 3-4 months for the next
kernel release, for something as simple as adding a device id.
But, if you send me a patch for upstream, that just moves these device
ids over to the option driver, I'll be glad to put it in the next
-stable release as well, which is what I think would be the best overall
option.
thanks,
