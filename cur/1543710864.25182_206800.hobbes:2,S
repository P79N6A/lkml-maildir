Hi Rik,
What was the problem by the way?

I could do that.

This still has a problem that !reclaim_mapped scans will not
shrink a runaway process before putting a lot of pressure on
the rest of the pagecache.
You could do a page_gather_pte_info type thing that doesn't
actually clear all the referenced bits (would probably
SetPageReferenced). Unfortunately this has the downside that
you also need to walk the pte chains for all mapped pages even
in the !reclaim_mapped case.
But it is a good start. We advertise the functionality, so we
should be trying to do something with rss limits.
