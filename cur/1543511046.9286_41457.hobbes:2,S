no, this does not work. sock is a pointer. filedescriptor is a index.
if you want to multiplex it you would need to write a kernel 
protocol family that can supply multiple sockets. 
If the problem is not very performance critical you can get around it
with a small user space library that binds a packet socket to
MCAT_PROTO and then does something like:
        /* only receive header */
        n = recv(packet_sk, buf, headerlen, MSG_PEEK); 
        if (n <= headerlen) error(); 
        if (header is for me) { 
        	n = recv(packet_sk, buf, buflen, 0); 
            ....
        }
Basically the MSG_PEEK avoids the full data copy if the packet
is not for you. But it would still eat a lot of context switches,
but for low speed networking (e.g. <= 64kbit/s) that should be no 
problem for modern CPUs.
