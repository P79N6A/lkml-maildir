Broken as in something is incorrectly transfered. Nothing in the
syslog. It's as if some special combination of data makes the transfer
to break, because the build breaks in the same place for each compile.
And YES, I've tried compiling the same source locally (no trouble),
and mounted Solaris --> Linux, without any problems.

Because the wsize=rsize shouldn't be the issue here. And if this really
is what breaks the kernel, something is REALLY broken.

Every NFS client we run in our network mounts as UDP, so I'm pretty
convinced, yes. The TCP NFS is newly added to v2.4.xx if I'm not all
wrong, and I definitely don't expect it to work properly. I DO expect
UDP to work, however.

4kB isn't aggresive. 4kB is VERY conservative. Both gives very bad
performance.

Well, the problem is that Linux doesn't generate any output that informs
the user that the system defaults to a rsize/wsize that differs from
what is common, that is, 32 kB. And as I said, I know of no other OS
that defaults to any other blocksize for NFSv3.
