Note that you can turn off padding by commenting the line
#define NFS_PAD_WRITES 1
in fs/nfs/nfs2xdr.c
If this shows padding to be the problem, then the bug lies with the
AIX server. It is supposed to read off the request length from the RPC
structure, rather than to assume things about the packet length.
