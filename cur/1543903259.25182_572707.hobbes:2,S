[  737.460654] Bad page state in process 'qemu-kvm'
[  737.460656] page:f5e68000 flags:0xea020000 mapping:00000000 mapcount:2 count:0
[  737.460657] Trying to fix it up, but a reboot is needed
[  737.460659] Backtrace:

[  737.460733]  [<c015a7ee>] free_hot_cold_page+0x68/0x15a
That's the "free_pages_check()", and in particular it seems to be 
"page_mapcount()" being non-zero that triggered that thing.
So it looks like something in KVM isn't coherent about the mapping vs the 
usage counters..
