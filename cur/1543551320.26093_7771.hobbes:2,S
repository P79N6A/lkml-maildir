	Assuming that you have EXT2 filesystem in the first place...
	(You don't mention what kernel version you have (uname -a),
	 nor what type of filesystem is it where you did the test.)
	If the 'titi/toto' file does not exist, and thus the directory
	modification does happen, then the timestamp will change.
	(If 'titi/toto' file exists, then an overwrite on it is done,
	 AND THE DIRECTORY WILL NOT CHANGE.)
	One "problem" is that "ls -ld titi" will show only MINUTES,
	which means you HAVE TO wait for the "date" command to show
	different minute before proceeding with file creation after
	you created the directory.
	There definitely will be difference, but you won't see it.
		rm -rf titi
		mkdir titi
		sleep 90
		ls -ld titi
		cp toto titi/toto
		ls -lf titi
	Are you still not seeing date change ?
