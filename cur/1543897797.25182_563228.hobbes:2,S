Hi,
[ It's good that you're trying to fix this, code in documentation should
be setting standards, clearly. ]

But IMO the above functions should be *fixed* to work properly instead
of simply commenting them out. If they are un-fixable, why even keep
the broken code in that file (only to mislead readers in future?). You
might as well remove those calls (and the function definitions) completely.
Best would be to fix them, of course.
My Rs. 0.02,
