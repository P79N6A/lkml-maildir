This is not that hard to find out yourself:
Just study the output od objdump -d and average the differences
of the first hex number in a line printed, which are followed by a ":"
e.g.
scripts/kconfig/mconf.o:     file format elf32-i386
Disassembly of section .text:
00000000 <init_wsize>:
       0:	83 ec 1c             	sub    $0x1c,%esp
       3:	8d 44 24 10          	lea    0x10(%esp),%eax
       7:	89 44 24 08          	mov    %eax,0x8(%esp)
so avg(3-7, 3-0) = 2.5
and so on...
Happy analyzing!
