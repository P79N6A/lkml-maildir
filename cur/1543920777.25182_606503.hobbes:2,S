Not necessarily. Given that detecting this chip safely seems to be
difficult (if not impossible), I'd rather only list the addresses which
are actually known to be used.

If the device does have an identification register, then yes you should
test here. However, I seem to understand that the AD7142 uses 2-byte
register addressing, while most I2C devices use 1-byte register
addressing (I2C is tricky in that respect). This means that "reading
from a register" for the AD7142 corresponds to "writing to a register"
for other chips. So even just reading from the device ID register in
the probe function isn't safe.
So to be on the safe side, the ad7142 driver should not probe _any_
address by default. Users should use the "probe" command line parameter
to explicitly ask for a given address to be probed.

No, there is no standard at all. Each driver does its best to identify
the chip depending of the specific register map. When the devices don't
have ID registers, we test for unused bits or registers cycling over
arbitrary boundaries.

Agreed, don't probe on reset values.

It the current state it's not acceptable. Too dangerous.

That's the way to go, really.
