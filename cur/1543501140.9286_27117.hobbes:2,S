   Wouldn't it be nice if we could define a line printer as secondary
   console?  (Those of you still remembering the old teletype
   terminals know what i mean.) Then one could simply attach an old
   spare dot-matrix printer to a free parallel port and have an
   instant hardcopy of any oopsen that might occur...
I and a few others back at Rutgers actually rigged up a real, still
working, Dec teletype as the console of a Solaris system to record a
recursive mutex panic and make a point to the Sun support people we
were dealing with at the time.  They got our point and stopped giving
us the runaround.
