The mm is not the sharing boundary; it can be shared along the usual
sharing boundaries; hence we have the usual two cases:
(a) shared between all those mmap()'ing some inode for file-backed memory
	Can be handled by embedding it into a struct address_space.
(b) shared between all fork()'s between exec()'s for anonymous memory
	Can be handled by embedding it in some new object representing
	all fork()'s between exec()'s.
(c) anonymous pages formerly owned by inodes orphaned by truncate().
	This is hard.
The containing object (for (a) and (b)) can be located with a back
pointer from the futex, except you have the usual intractable disaster
whenever file-backed pages are anonymized via truncate().
