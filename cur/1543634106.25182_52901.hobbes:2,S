Unfortunately, this is rather painful:
	1) File A contains an initcall.
	2) Find Module A which File A is part of.
	3) For each exported symbol used by Module A
		4) Find Module B which exports this symbol.
		5) Find Files B which make up Module B.
		6) For each initcall in Files B, insert a dependency.
Any clues for (2) and (5)?
Rusty.
