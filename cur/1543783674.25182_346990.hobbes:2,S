OK, I finally have a theory about this.  It's the everything goes via
bios code.  Previously there were several levels at which commands could
exit the SCSI stack; now we make everything go via bios, so they all
come out at the top.
get_capabilities() in sr.c is sending a TEST_UNIT_READY which will get
NOT_READY back.  Previously this was completing before it got to
scsi_io_completion(); now it doesn't.  There must be quite a few cases
like this.  The best fix is probably to use and respect REQ_QUIET for
internally generated commands.
