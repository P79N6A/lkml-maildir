Maybe, maybe not.  Most, if not all of my boxes here don't have qt, and
they're not going to get qt any time soon.  qt has a long list of
dependencies which gtk doesn't have, which, imho is an overriding factor
for why we should have a gtk implementation.
Not that I used the old xconfig often anyway. 8)
