I don't think anyone is going to accidentally type "mkreiserfs" thinking
mke2fs somehow. That one doesnt worry me. Don't however think you can safely
test an fs on a production box just on one partition and be safe. You can
be _safer_ but you should be prepared to cover the worst.
if you've got a big squid box and you can rebuild it in disaster cases then
give reiserfs and ext3 a good beating. I doubt either will trash anything
but ..

The 0.90 RAID has the same problem. There have been a pile of discussions 
involving Ingo, Hans, Stephen and others like SGI about this.

I think that will happen. Adding reiserfs is one patch command. It isnt a big
challenge and vendors can choose to trust it if they feel its stable even
before its clean enough for Linus to accept.
