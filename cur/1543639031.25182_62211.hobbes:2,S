Partially agree.  Removing all args might be worthwhile.  But all these
softirqs use the "cpu" arg to access per-cpu data, which should be
changed to use the per_cpu_data mechanism anyway, which removes the
point of the arg.
Things haven't been changed over because I haven't pushed the per-cpu
interface changes (required for some archs 8() to Linus yet.  But you'll
want them so we can save space (you only need allocate per-cpu data for
cpus where cpu_possible(i) is true).
Clear?
Rusty.
