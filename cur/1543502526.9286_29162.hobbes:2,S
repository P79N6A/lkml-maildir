Hello Marc.
There is one thing you always should keep in mind:
Most people are using a distribution like Red Hat, Suse, Caldera, ... .
So, when they are compiling and installing new source, kernel-images,
modules, etc. they might get there system inconsistent or maybe it won't
run anymore for some reason.
So, if you really want to setup such a service that produces a
'kernel-package' it would be best do make it a REAL package, so it
DOESN'T break the system anymore.
Debain already has a package that is doing that in one way or the
other...:
Package: kernel-package
Description: Debian Linux kernel package build scripts.
 This package provides the capability to create a debian
 kernel-image package by just running make-kpkg kernel_image in a
 kernel source directory tree.  It can also build the kernel source
 package as a debian file, the kernel headers package. In general, this
 package is very useful if you need to create a custom kernel, if, for
 example, the default kernel does not support some of your hardware, or
 you wish a leaner, meaner kernel.
I don't use it as I don't want to be forced to stick to Debian systems.
Best wishes, 
  Steffen
