Nice patch!
A couple of points:
Why not use the more commonly named conditional_schedule instead of
preempt() ?  In addition to being more in-use (low-latency, lock-break,
and Andrea's aa patch all use it) I think it better conveys its meaning,
which is a schedule() but only conditionally.
I'm sure it is just being pedantic, but why not just make need_preempt
and preempt (which I would rename need_schedule and
conditional_schedule, personally) defines?  Example:
	#define need_schedule() (unlikely(current->need_resched))
	#define conditional_schedule() do { \
		if (need_schedule()) \
			schedule(); \
	} while(0);
Next, in kernel/sched.c you wrap need_preempt in an unlikey() but note
it is unlikely by design ... Same in mm/vmscan.c a couple times.
Oh, and the patch is confusingly similar to preempt-kernel in name, but
I guess that is my problem. :-)
Anyhow, I like.  2.5 _and_ 2.4?
