	Hi;
	Well, I have only tested this with dvd+rw (and mount with the
noatime option, to avoid wearing out your media), and it is just *way*
to slow, vs. pktcdvd. I gave up on a copy that would have taken a minute
or two under pktcdvd after over an hour with just the block device
mount.
	Of course, pktcdvd gives me and others pretty consistant data
corruption. (see bug 4290 on bugzilla.kernel.org)

ps. others have reported that mt. rainier support works well, and obviates
pktcdvd.
