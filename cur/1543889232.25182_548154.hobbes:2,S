I was unable to reproduce the numbers Miguel generated, comments below. 
The -ck2 patch seems to run nicely, although the memory repopulation 
from swap would be most useful on system which have a lot of memory 
pressure.

I spent a few hours running the -ck2 patch, and I didn't see any numbers 
like yours. What I did see is going up with my previous results as 
http://www.tmr.com/~davidsen/sched_smooth_04.html.
 While there were 
still some minor pauses in glxgears with my test, performance was very 
similar to the sd-0.48 results. And I did try watching video with high 
load, without problems. Only when I run a lot of other screen-changing 
processes can I see pauses in the display.

I'll include the -ck2 patch in my testing on other hardware.
