Certainly. But there are some uses where you absolutely don't want them. 
Also are there lots of uses where you can't do away with the tight thing 
DOS gives you for i386. I'm happily using Sunish slices there.

Possibly, but you can even put together smaller arrays then (at least on a 
sane controller). That's what the disk size setup is for. And that's, 
after all, nothing the OS needs to take care of. It just gets to see say 
16 disks of 1 TiB size each. Nothing mad.
But why have a partition table on each of these 16 pseudo disks?

Why? There's a reason why raid is mutable.

I plug another in here and restore.

I don't see how partitioning could help you out here.

...and pointless.

Well, there's absolutely no need to do that. There are tools which can
scribble together the old table, and these could even kick automagically.  
(Who else thinks the BIOS shall always be replaced with something sane?)
Once your table is restored, good luck.
On the i386 boxes that we run (recently reduced to 20) I don't change too 
much about the tables. I can use a perl script from a boot cd to scribble 
them together again. And here I agree with partition tables, because I 
mostly haven't got more than two disks -- and I need to have space for
swap, housings, workspace and the entire root.
