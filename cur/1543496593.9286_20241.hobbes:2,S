Hi!
So, have you tried to apply the 'patch-2.2.1' to a 
'patch-2.2.0-pre9'-patched kernel tree (The Makefile says '-final')?
It produces lots of rejects. And the diff -urN between 
'linux-2.2.0-pre9' and 'linux-2.2.0' I had to produce by myself 
(which I expected to find as 'patch-2.2.0-pre9-to-2.2.0')
is not small, 23315 bytes in it's .bz2 version.
And I have never seen a 'patch-2.2.0-final.bz2' !

Puzzled,
