I presume that you're making these values as tokens so that the I/O access
routines (such as pcibios_write_config_byte) can be told how to access their
devices.
If this is the case, then the Vendor-Defined-Registers access functions that I
already provide could prove useful (or may be extended). This involves a pair
of functions pointed to by my device operations structure that allow access to
the devices registers:
	int (*ci_read_vdr)(cmgr_device *dev, int addr, int num, int size,
			   void *buf);
	int (*ci_set_vdr)(cmgr_device *dev, int addr, int num, int size,
			  const void *buf);
You pass the functions a device structure to say how to reach the device, and
leave the actual communication method up to them. It may involve a pcibios_*
function, or it may involve rendering down to some PCMCIA operations.

I'm not sure what your mean by this - doesn't it need to be mapped so that the
kernel can access it, or do you mean giving bits of real memory to a device
for its own purposes?

What exactly do you mean? Does I2O deal with whole buses rather than devices?
Or is it a case of I2O allocating resources to a bus?
