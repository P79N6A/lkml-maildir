It depends if you have Andre's IDE patches applied to your kernel sources
or not.

It may be that there is some difficulty in the order the IDE cards are
initialized.  From your previous dmesg output, it appears that ide3 and ide4
(PCI cards) are initialized before ide2 (ISA card), so they may be stealing
an ioport that the ISA card needs.  Try booting with just the SB32 card
and checking /proc/ioports, and then with only the other card, and see
if anything in /proc/ioports (or /proc/interrupts) is conflicting.
Cheers, Andreas
