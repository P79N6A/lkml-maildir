Subject: [PATCH][0/3] Completely out of line spinlocks (i386, x86_64)

-- from previous announce --
Pulled from the -tiny tree, the focus of this patch is for reduced kernel
image size but in the process we benefit from improved cache performance
since it's possible for the common text to be present in cache. This is
probably more of a win on shared cache multiprocessor systems like
P4/Xeon HT. It's been benchmarked with bonnie++ on 2x and 4x PIII (my
ideal target would be a 4x+ logical cpu Xeon).
Changes have been made based on feedback from various people, most notably
profiling support for readprofile and oprofile.

Changes from the last release include using fastcall and normal C
functions for the out of line spinlock code. There was an additional
suggestion by Linus to move the preempt code out of line too but i think
that may be too invasive for this first step.
Results from a dbench run on 2, 4 and 8x systems are available at
http://www.zwane.ca/cool-locks-stp
 but based on those results there is no
observable performance regression.
