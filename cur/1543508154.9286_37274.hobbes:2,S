Hi
i've been reading the PCI-HOWTO (i know, quite old but...) and i stumbled on a
little thing :
There is a driver in the 1.3.x kernels (available as a patch for the
1.2.13 kernel) written by someone associated with buslogic that fully
supports the 946C and ALL of it's features including strict round
robin, tagged queuing, multiple scatter/gather, multiple mailboxes,
IRQ sharing, and yes, 15 devices on Fast/Wide.  It is no longer
necessary to use any ISA emulation with the driver (no DMA channel, no
ISA address), and the driver is /fast/ and /stable/ (it's out of BETA
and into full release).
and i do not see what round robin means in this context.
and the same for multiple mailboxes, i edited drivers/scsi/BusLogic.c but it's
not explained there, i also looked into Documentation/IO-mapping.txt but i
still do not understand what a mailbox really is.
