That's cool.  That's what should be in a SCM.  I guess we may have a
misunderstanding where I say "drop-in tree" and you assume I mean using CVS
to tag and branch a subset of the kernel source?  The drop-in tree is what I
described in my initial response to you so many posts ago.  It doesn't have
to be specifically tied to a CVS-centric mode of development, but before some
of the other SCMs came into fruition, CVS was the easiest (or most popular
if you insist it wasn't easy) way to do it.  Now we have advanced SCMs
available, and I hope to use one that will still support drop-in trees
while allowing me access to all the whizbang features that will make my
life easier.

I'd hate to sound like I'm trolling or being a broken record.  But I don't
currently have that option with BK.  This is the option I want, to be able
to not have to worry about pulling all changes or being able to cordon off
only the bit I want/need to work with.  See the above as to why CVS isn't
just the means, it's just the tool currently used for drop-in maintenance.
Give me proper drop-in support using BK (or any other modern SCM tool), and
I'm sold.

When my drop-in tree file changes upstream, I'll find out in the next
upstream sync.  Obviously if my drop-in tree is current, that file hasn't
changed yet.  File renames are broken, but I never pretended they weren't.  I
guess what you're saying is it comes down to me weighing out feature-rich
set vs. feature-less set, where BK is the former, and I should expect to have
to sacrifice my entire development model (drop-in trees, not CVS) for the
bloated model that BK currently *enforces* (see your above paragraph about
having the option).

This was already being done with the satellite projects and drop-in
trees, but didn't have the benefit of being SCM-controlled *globally*.  I'd
very much like to see this happen.  Was there any timeframe on this or
should I just start searching lkml archives?

Nope, I said that based on what I read at www.bitkeeper.com, BK didn't
support drop-in trees *today*.  I said that the last time I actively used
the tool was 2 years ago, but I haven't had a reason to use it since then.
In a public forum, which you use to promote sales and use of your product, I
stated quite simply and plainly that BK won't allow me to do drop-in trees,
with the simplicity of CVS.  Even using a full kernel source tree as CVS
HEAD and branching subsets of HEAD into small drop-in like branches does
what I need to do in CVS.  This is even before you start worrying about
automerging and file renaming - I can't do the above using BK - for kernel
development.
Two years ago, or today, BK still doesn't do it, not without requiring
massive structural changes to the master repository by the project owner -
not the satellite maintainers.  This requires a significant amount of
planning ahead and effort from Linus (or whoever ends up doing it), where
using the drop-in tree model that burden is placed on the satellite
maintainer.  When I decide to start and maintain the "linux toaster
driver", I pull out the source I need from mainline, and setup my drop-in
tree from that and my new imports.  The BK way to do it is to simply "clone
the master" and work from that.  Not a drop-in.
I voiced a legitimate concern about why drop-in trees were useful, and why
I wouldn't be able to contiue their development using BK.  You proceeded (for
a couple of posts at least) to dodge that concern with arguments of why CVS
pales in comparison to BK.  That I didn't really care about, and maybe you
should be asking yourself, "If I didn't have the correct answer and I can't
accurately address this guy's concern, why did I bother replying in the first
place?"

Right.  We can't do it, only the repository owner can.  By your own
admission the drop-in tree as I described it isn't supported:
"Ahh, OK, we're already working on this.  We call 'em nested repositories
and one of the problems they solve is exactly the problem you described.
Think of them as CVS modules, with a little more formality, and you're
about there.  They also solve a bunch of performance problems."
The "csetprune" command you've pointed me to apparently doesn't do this.

Yep, you're correct, except about the handwaving part.  Last I checked, 2.2
was still being maintained, and 2.4 is also being maintained.  Believe it or
not, I have to be bothered with tracking changes between all of these
versions *and* 2.5, and at least the 2.2 variant still needs to be done by
hand.  2.4 and 2.5 are now SCM-controlled by BK.  That's great, and I'm
being serious here.  But it can't cope with the drop-in style, and at this
point I can't be coerced into a new mode of development.  If BK could sanely
handle drop-in trees (the right way), trust me, I'd already be using it.  But
I'm still forced to do the merging work by hand, if I insist on maintaining
the drop-in tree (without CVS), even if using a BK clone as my source base.
My tool needs to do what I tell it to, not the other way around.

If you were able to propose a sane way to continue using the drop-in model
using BK, then I'd have no problems taking you seriously.  My only claim
was that BK couldn't handle drop-in trees.  I didn't say it sucked overall
as a SCM or that I wanted to protest because it wasn't open.  The "work" was
me perusing the bitkeeper webpage, and going back and forth with you, the guy
I thought would be the most intelligent on all of BK's features.  Are you
saying the only way for me to evaluate a tool (one that I haven't used in
ages) is to use it?  I can't rely on documentation or peer reviews and
comments?  Wouldn't my time be spared if you just told me what it would or
wouldn't support?

It was a good read, and easy to follow, but it still does the opposite of
what I need to do.  I want multiple small project-specific trees, not a
myriad of full kernel trees.  Everything else gave me a good starting point
for doing SCM-controlled kernel development using BK.  Thanks for the
pointer.

Point taken about the drop-in tree being a hack, when used within the
limitations of CVS.  With a SCM that could do it intelligently, it would be
overly useful, but unfortunately BK can't do it at all (or, it does it in
the complete reverse).
I already have been looking at alternatives to CVS that would allow me to
maintain a master kernel source repository with many satellite "branches" that
would be equivalent to small drop-in trees for the various kernel ports and
subsystems.  I would also need a reasonable way to do merges between the
satellites and the trunk, and being able to do it locally with cloning would
be a major plus.
I've found that Arch comes the closest to what I need, so I've been "doing
my homework" with it.  When I do run into snags, or when Arch trips over
itself when I'm trying to maintain my satellites at least I do have the source
instead of the requirement that I bitch to you about missing functionality.  I
suppose for the project I'm working on, once it gets to the point where I
need to grab up to the minute changes, I can be bothered with setting up
either an Arch<->BK gateway or find another means to migrate updates from
the latter.
If BK can gain (intelligent, where satellite maintainers can split, not
just root) drop-in support to where it doesn't make sense for me to use
Arch for Linux kernel projects, I'd start using it (and recommend it) for my
satellite projects immediately.  Again, for me it boils down to using the
best tool for the job.
