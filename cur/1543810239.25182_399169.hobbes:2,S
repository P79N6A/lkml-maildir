Hi Takashi.
[ Takashi: Adam's wonderful provider is again not accepting mail from my 
wonderful provider. Could you forward? Also added alsa-devel ]
I noticed on 2.6.16-rc4 that my MPU-401 wasn't functional, due to a
simple copy & paste error in sound/isa/cs423x/cs4236.c:

Please apply. However, when I tested it (mpu works fine again after
this) I noticed that modprobe -r snd-cs4236 didn't release things --
specifically that the fixed index=1 I have for the card failed on a
subsequent modprobe since ALSA believes that index is still taken.
I stuck a few printks in cs4236.c. From "snd_cs423x_unregister_all",
"pnp_unregister_card_driver(&cs423x_pnpc_driver)" is indeed being called
but the card driver's own remove method, snd_cs423x_pnpc_remove, is not.
I started looking, but ran into the next issue again -- when snd-cs4236
is not card1 but card0, modprobe -r oopses in snd_timer_free (attached)
meaning debugging this wants someone with more of an overview of recent
damage done^W^Wchanges made.
Given that calling pnp_unregister_card_driver() is not cs4236 specific,
I assume the problem is more general. Possibly all ALSA ISA-PnP drivers.
Or, given that pnp_unregister_card_driver is not an ALSA function, maybe
even all ISA-PnP drivers using the card_driver interface.
The more general this problem turns out, the more reason there would be
for fixing this pre 2.6.16, obviously. I can test patches...
Rene.
