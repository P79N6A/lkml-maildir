	You are correct. This is bahavior that is undefined by the C language, but
defined by the implementation. So determining what the program was supposed
to do requires determining whether the person who wrote it was familiar with
the implementation on which it is being used. Amusingly, this means the
program is supposed to do different things depending upon what
implementation of malloc you have.
	IIRC, malloc(0) is defined to return a unique block of memory that it is
valid to pass to free. However, doing anything with this memory (read/write)
is undefined by the C standard.
