Thanks for the further report.  And you had my st.c patch in along
with 2.6.14.3, but it still happened, very much like before (except the
latter errors, general protection fault onwards - but once we get into
using one page for two uses at the same time, anything can go wrong).
I've been staring and thinking, but no inspiration yet.
