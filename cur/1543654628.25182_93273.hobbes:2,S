Subject: 2.4.20: ext3: Assertion failure in journal_forget() - filesystem destroyed

This started to happen during larger (10MB-420MB) rsync based writes to
a striped ext3 partition (/dev/md11) residing on 4 scsi disks which is
mounted with defaults, i.e. data=ordered (rsync over 100Mbps link):

Trying to access the partition resulted in processes hanging in D state:
5336 pts/0    D      0:00 ls -a -N --color=tty -T 0 -l /mnt/data8
e2fstools version is 1.32 and the partition was created with this
version using 'mke2fs -j -b 2048 -i 4096 -R stride=16 /dev/md11'.
An earlier dump of the partition data using tune2fs -l gave:

Trying 'e2fsck -y /dev/md11' after a reboot showed so many errors and
continued to run for minutes that I aborted e2fsck and do assume that
the file system was completely destroyed.
After recreation of the filesystem on /dev/md11 a rsync run completed
without errors.
As a side note: the system having the rsync sources has an identical
formatted partition (the systems are hardware twins) and doesn't show
any errors.
Some final information about the raid configuration of /dev/md11:
raiddev /dev/md11
          raid-level              0
          nr-raid-disks           4
          nr-spare-disks          0
