This was a known issue that was corrected in 6.2.5.  The driver was
referencing an uninitialized register on the card, which cause the
parity error.  The uninitialized reference was harmless as the value
was ignored in the cases that it was uninitialized, but the panic it
created was a bit rough on users. 8-)
