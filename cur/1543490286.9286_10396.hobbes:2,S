It still will, even with that bug fixed.  procps 1.2.x use the h flag to
turn off header generation; Albert's version tries to implement every flag
ever available under any version of ps ever made (correct me if I am wrong,
Albert) and so h is overloaded -- turn off all header generation (specific
to old procps) and generate a header every page (long-time BSD meaning)
and he tries to distinguish between the two based on whether standard in
is a tty.  Unfortunately, most scripts, including init scripts, run with
standard in being a tty, so the distinguisher doesn't work.
We're working on resolving this...
