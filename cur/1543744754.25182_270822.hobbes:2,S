On monday I'll make a patch to place the oom killer at the right place.
Marcelo's argument that kswapd is a localized place isn't sound to me,
kswapd is still racing against all other task contexts, so if the task
context isn't reliable, there's no reason why kswapd should be more
reliable than the task context. the trick is to check the _right_
watermarks before invoking the oom killer, it's not about racing against
each other, 2.6 is buggy in not checking the watermarks. Moving the oom
killer in kswapd can only make thing worse, fix is simple, and it's the
opposite thing: move the oom killer up the stack outside vmscan.c.
