Documentation/fb/vesafb.txt, X11 paragraph, last sentence:
-------8<-----
The X-Server must restore the video mode correctly, else you end up
with a broken console (and vesafb cannot do anything about this).

I have no idea. I know that atyfb does not work on ATIs I have, and
I have no idea how X11 behaves on them. I do not have other hardware
at all.

With driver "mga" and option "usefbdev" you should get 'real' X, they'll
use acceleration. Only difference is that they'll use kernel fbdev
to set videomode (in XF4.0 there is a bug that DGA mode in X11 mga driver 
will go directly to hardware even if usefbdev is specified, but with XF4.1 
you should be safe).
