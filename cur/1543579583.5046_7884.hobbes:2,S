We have:
   0x82 - Linux swap
   0x83 - Linux filesystem
   0x85 - Linux extended partition (yes, this one does matter!)
0x81 isn't Linux, but rather a Minix partition ID.
There seems to be some value in having a different value for swap.  It
lets an automatic program find a partition that does not contain data.
