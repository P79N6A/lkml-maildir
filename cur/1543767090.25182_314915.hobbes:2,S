And mips.
While sparc64 doesn't have ll/sc, it does have compare-and-swap and
it's trivial to use that exactly like we use ll/sc.  S390 also has
compare-and-swap as its atomic primitive.
Seems to me that the ppc semaphore implementation is superior to the
i386 implementation that seems to have been propagated here.  Indeed,
I might think it would help i486, ia64, and amd64 to use the ppc style
compare-and-swap instead of the existing implementation.  Care would
have to be taken such that i386 still works, but I suspect the vast
majority of folk don't configure for that.
I would support two or three common implementations, but definitely
not the one implementation presented.
