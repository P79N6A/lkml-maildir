I completely agree. But who would volunteer to spend their time fixing
devfs if no one said they wanted devfs, if all evidence says everyone is
happy with udev? I just wanted to get out that I'm not, I think devfs
(as a concept, not neccessarily the implementation in the kernel right
now) has merits udev does not and never will possess, and to see if anyone
else agrees.

I didn't mean it as an idea, hence the bit about not advocating it. I'm
just trying to show that they're basically the same thing. The kernel is
exporting in file form three pieces of information, character/block,
major, and minor whether it's done as an actual device file or not.
Trying to show how both are doing the same thing.

Nor would you want it to... Although, it might be handy for something
like a SCSI controller. An opendir() in its directory would trigger the
kernel to see what's attached to it. Postponing the probing of every LUN
until someone goes looking could speed up boot times quite a bit.

That's a point, and one I had thought of. But on the other hand, the
kernel also seems to be moving toward exporting information to userspace
through simple RAM based filesystems. And while I don't know enough
about the internals of these things to say for sure, I wouldn't be
surprised if /dev as a special exported filesystem actually took less
RAM than /dev on tmpfs, since tmpfs has to be so much more generic
(supporting files that can be up to ssize_t long, the sendfile() method
so they can be mounted loopback, etc) while a devfs-alike would just be
storing small files: devices, symlinks, fifos, etc. Nothing with actual
data.

Well, as I said, no sense in fixing devfs if nobody wants it. udev's
author is giving that impression, but I don't feel that way myself and
wanted to see if anyone else agreed.
