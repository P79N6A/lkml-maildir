Can this be correct?
Intuitively, I would expect several CPUs hammering away at the compile to 
finish faster than one.  Given these numbers, I would have to conclude 
that is not just wrong, but absolutely wrong.  Compile time increases 
linearly with the number of jobs, regardless of the number of CPUs.
What would cause this?  Severe memory bottlenecks?
