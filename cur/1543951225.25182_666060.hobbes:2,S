Good idea, it would be nice to offer that operating mode.  But linear
sweeping is going to put the most data onto rotating media the fastest,
thus making the loss-of-line-power flush window as small as possible,
which is what the current incarnation of this driver optimizes for.
Note that half a TB worth of dirty ramdisk chunks will need 1 GB of
linked list storage, so this imposes a limit on total dirty data for
practical purposes.

What happens with the linked list gets too long?  Fall back to linear
sweep?  Or accept suboptimal write caching?
A linked list would work for linking together dirty bitmap pages, one
level up, thus 2**15 rarer.  Even there I prefer the linear sweep.  I
intend to implement a dirty map of the dirty map, at least because I
have not seen one of those before, but also because I think it will
perform well.

Indeed.  That is the entire reason I did it that way.  In fact ramback
used to write the ramdisk and backing store from the same application
source, so the writethrough code was significantly shorter.  But not
correct...

The only time ramback cares about barriers is when it switches to
writethrough mode.  It would be nice to have a mode where barriers are
respected at the backing store level, but there is no way you will get
the same write performance.  The central idea here is that ramback
relies on a UPS to achieve the ultimate in disk performance.  I agree
that other modes would be very nice, but not necessary for this thing
to be actually useful.  I suspect than early users will be looking for
all the performance that can get.

As a block device it is very flexible, and as a block device it is
fairly simple.  As a block device, the only interesting userspace setup
is the hookup to power management scripts.  Dnotify... probably you
meant inotify, and even then it sounds daunting, but maybe somebody
can prove me wrong.

That would a nice hack, why not take a run at it?
