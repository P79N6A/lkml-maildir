Greg, I have now pretty well confirmed that this patch is what caused 
the tvtime audio breakage I was observing here.  Rebooting to 
2.6.11.1, everything works, rebooting to 2.6.11.2, and its broken.  
ditto for .3 and .4, so last night I built a .5 (had to patch the 
Makefiles EXTRAVERSION & rebuild before it would boot after the 
build) but I built it *without* this patch, and everything works.
This patch looks good to me except for the added MAX_EVENTS define.  
Did anyone actually put in a printk at that point and see what 
MAX_EVENTS actually was by that define?
