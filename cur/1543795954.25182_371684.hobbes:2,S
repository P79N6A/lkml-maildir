So if I understand correctly, the kernel would program a counter
to count elapsed cycles while executing a ring 0 and ring 3. The watchdog
works by polling on the counter and after a certain delta is reached it
triggers an NMI interrupt which, in turn, causes a kernel crash and the
(bug) report. Is that the correct behavior?

Well the big difference here is that once the counter reaches 2^{47}, it goes
back to zero, i.e., it wraps around silently by default. If you are polling
it, you will suddenly see a huge delta and think that a long perriod of time
has elapsed when in fact it is just one cycle. The TSC may not count all cycles
but the user sees the counter has continuously increasing.
Also are you sure that the PERFCTR0/PERFSEL0 are not affected when going
into lower power state? I know by experience that one IA-64, for instance,
the counters are seriously affected.

As Ray mentioned, it all depends on what the user/sysdamin is after.
Some people maybe okay with disbaling NMI in favor of more counters.
Obviously others people are not.

I discussed the idea of an abitration layer to access performance
counters with David Gibson a coule of months ago. I do believe this is
an important mechanism to have and I would like to restart the discussion
on this topic. You are providing us another reason why this could
be useful.
