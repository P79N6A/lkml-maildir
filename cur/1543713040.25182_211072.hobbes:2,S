Either method could work with some restrictions.  Either way, some
userspace tools need to be taught about the changes.  Personally I
don't care much either way, but the simple trick is already working on
my notebook and the problems are not too bad (not too good either).
BTW: sendfile() for ext[23] is finished, so the actual copy can be
done inside the kernel now.  Patch will follow soon. (-EBUSY)
