There is something like this
raw_notifier_call_chain(&cpu_chain, CPU_DOWN_FAILED, (void *)(long)cpu);
missing in kernel cpu.c in _cpu_down() in case CPU_DOWN_PREPARE
returned with NOTIFY_BAD. However... this reveals that there is just a
more fundamental problem.
The workqueue code grabs a lock on CPU_[UP|DOWN]_PREPARE and releases it
again on CPU_DOWN_FAILED/CPU_UP_CANCELED. If something in the callchain
returns NOTIFY_BAD the rest of the entries in the callchain won't be
called anymore. But DOWN_FAILED/UP_CANCELED will be called for every
entry.
So we might even end up with a mutex_unlock(&workqueue_mutex) even if
mutex_lock(&workqueue_mutex) hasn't been called...
Maybe this will be addressed by somebody else since cpu hotplug locking
is being worked on (again).
