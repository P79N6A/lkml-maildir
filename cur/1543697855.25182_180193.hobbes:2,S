I need a bottle of aspirin, no change, but this boot, its working.  Go 
figure.  FWIW, syslogd is running just fine, or is for this boot 
anyway...  At this point I don't even have a SWAG about whats going 
on.
Besides, that was a shell I typed that into, and I don't believe it 
actually spawned the users shell.  No visible indicator that I could 
see.
