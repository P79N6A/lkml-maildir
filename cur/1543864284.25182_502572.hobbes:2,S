Yup, we did that from day 1 on powerpc :-) However, I don't totally
agree with adding some other remapping layer here, I think if we want
PIO 0 to be illegal, then make it illegal at the HW level too.
The reason is in fact the same as Linus invoked for remapping it in the
first place -> make things look like an x86 :-)
That is, quite a few non-x86 machines do have some kind of superIO chip
or other set of legacy devices around. They also commonly have VGA cards
hard decoding VGA PIO addresses.
So here's a very simplified version on how most non-x86 platforms do
PIO :
at boot:
 pci_io_base = ioremap(MAGIC_PIO_REGION);
and then
 #define inb(port)	(readb(pci_io_base + (port)))
The nice thing with that approach is that all those legacy x86 drivers
for bits in your SuperIO chip or for VGA do actually still work when they
do
 inb(STUPID_HARD_CODED_IO_PORT);
While if we now add some magic remapping to make 0 illegal, that will break
and all those legacy drivers would have to be fixed, which nobody wants
to do.
So I do stand firm there. I don't necessarily mind deciding that 0 is an
illegal PIO address, but if we're going to do that, we should make it
illegal as a HW PIO address, not by adding a remapping trick to something
that really doesn't want more than it already has :-)
Ben.
