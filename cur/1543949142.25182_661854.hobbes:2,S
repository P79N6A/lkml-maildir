Hm, perhaps I don't understand the issue correctly, so please let me restate it.
We have the design issue that it's possible to register a child of a device
that was taken for suspend or even suspended which, in turn, leads to a wrong
ordering of devices on dpm_active.  Namely, suppose that device dev is taken
from the end of dpm_active and suspend_device(dev, state) is going to be called
If at the same time a child of dev is being registered and
suspend_device(dev, state) returns 0, dev will be taken out of dpm_active, but
the new device (its child) will be added to the end of dpm_active and
subsequently we'll attempt to suspend it.  That will be wrong.
Also, if a dev's child is registered after suspending all devices, it will go
to the end of dpm_active, so after the subsequent resume dev will end up
closer to the end of the list than the new child.  Thus, during the next
suspend it will be taken for suspending before this child and that will be
wrong either.  Note that this situation need not look dangerously from the
driver's perspective, since it doesn't know of the dpm_active ordering issue.
One of the possible solutions is to require suspend_device(dev, state) to
return an error if it detects a concurrent child registration.   This, however
is not sufficient, because the registration of a child may go unseen, right
after suspend_device(dev, state) returns and before dpm_list_mtx is reacquired.
For this reason, we need an additional mechanism to detect such situations
and work around them.  [Hence, the question arises whether it's really
necessary to require suspend_device(dev, state) to detect concurrent
registrations of children (we need to detect them independently anyway) etc.]
There also would have to be a mechanism for detecting registrations when
all devices have been suspended (we discussed that approach previously).
The other possible solution, and that's the one I'm considering, is to use
locking to prevent the registration of children of suspended or suspending
devices from happening.  [This is to protect _our_ data structure, which is
the dpm_active list, from corruption.]
Now, to this end, we'd need an additional lock for each device, because using
dev->sem for this purpose will be prone to deadlocks.  My idea is to take this
lock (call it dev->power.lock) as soon as dev is selected for suspending
and require that it be acquired for registering any new children of dev.  In
that case, the only open window is when a new child of dev is registered right
after we've found dev at the end of dpm_active and right prior to taking
dev->power.lock.  However, we may avoid this race by (1) selecting dev
for suspending under dpm_list_mtx and (2) checking if it's still at the end of
dpm_active under dev->power.lock and dpm_list_mtx (the selection of a device
for suspending is repeated if this check fails).
The patch I sent previously implemented this idea, but it released
dev->power.lock after calling resume_device(dev), which is not really necessary
(dev->power.lock may be released as soon as dev is put back on dpm_active).
Below is another version of this patch that releases dev->power.lock earlier
and uses semaphores instead of mutexes.  [Note that it's trivial to rework it
so that the registrations of children considered as invalid will fail instead
of being blocked.]

The appended patch may be reworked to release dev->power.lock for all devices
once they all have been suspended, but since nobody should ever try to register
a child below a suspended parent, that shouldn't be necessary.

That actually requires quite a bit of entangled code, new flags etc. :-)

We can use the lock for failing registrations just as well.

Well, let the new lock be a semaphore, then. ;-)

The problem is that the new children should really be suspended _before_ the
parent.  One solution is to resume the parent in case we've detected new
children registered, the other one is not to suspend the parent at all in case
any new children appear, and that's what I'm attempting to achieve.

Well, it surely is reasonable. ;-)

You may be right.

I think that we may have to disable runtime PM as soon even earlier, just prior
to starting a transition to a sleep state.  There are systems which may crash
if we don't do that.

Yes.
In fact I'd like to work out some generic guidance for all device drivers
describing how to do such things.

OTOH, the core should be allowed to protect it's data structures ...
