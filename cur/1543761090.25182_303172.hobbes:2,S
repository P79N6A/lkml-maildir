> >>Shouldn't issues like this be in the coding style document?
There is not a concensus (nor a King Penguin dictate) between the
"while(1)" and "for(;;)" style to document.  If this were a
frequently asked question, I suppose someone would eventually
note in a coding style doc that either style is acceptable.
> It's a shame the 'rather trivial' issue got picked up in the first place 
Not a shame at all.  Such coding style issues are well known to be a
proper subject for discussion here.
