Because master engineer Molnar has determined that's the correct way.

Yes, not good with fluctuating timeslices all over the place makes for more 
bounce in the algorithm, and the big problem - the cpu intensive applications 
get demoted to smaller timeslices and they are the tasks that benefit the 
most from larger timeslices (for effective cpu cache usage).
