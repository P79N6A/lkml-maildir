There are no panaceas and any implementation of an SMP Kernel is going to
favor some types of applications over others. Is there a "specification" or
"goal" written down somewhere that tells what types of applications
LINUX/SMP is intended to favor?
Is performance or stability the more preferred goal? Where stability means
applications will not require recoding as the SMP Kernel matures.
