Hello, Christoph!
IBM shipped the promised SAN Filesystem some months ago.  The source
code for the Linux client was released under GPL, as promised, and may
be found at the following URL:
https://www6.software.ibm.com/dl/sanfsys/sanfsref-i?S_PKG=dl&S_TACT=&S_CMP=
A PDF of the protocol specification may be found at the following URL:
http://www.storage.ibm.com/software/virtualization/sfs/protocol.html
These URLs do require that you register, but there is no cost nor any
agreement other than the GPL itself.  The Linux client has not been
shipped as product yet.  The code is still quite rough, which is one
reason that it has not be submitted to, for example, LKML.  ;-)
						Thanx, Paul
