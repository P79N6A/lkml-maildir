Subject: hfsplus bugs in linux-2.6.5

Here's how to trigger a hfsplus bug in linux-2.6.5:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/test bs=1k count=10k
newfs_hfs /test
mount -t hfsplus /test /mnt/test -o loop
cd /mnt/test
mkdir a; mkdir b
mv a b
The last command doesn't correctly move "a": it complains that it 
cannot find "b/a". Effectively, it creates an entry in "b", but that 
entry doesn't correspond to any actual directory "a". This means I am 
stuck with a directory "b" which I can't delete with "rm -rf b". 
However, I can delete it with:
rmdir b; rm -rf b
If above, after creating, mounting and cd-ing to the hfsplus 
filesystem, I do:
cp -r /whatever/module-init-tools-3.0 .
mkdir m; mv mod* m
rmdir m; rm -rf m
cp -r /whatever/module-init-tools-3.0 .
Then the machine hangs. While I can still change the screen brightness 
with the topleft keys of the keyboard, I can't change virtual consoles 
anymore.
A second, less serious wierdness is that directories created with linux 
are bigger than directories created with Mac OS X: When I do "for 
((i=1;i>0;i++)); do mkdir $i; done" on a new 1MB-HFS+-image on Mac OS 
X, I can create about 6300 directories. With Linux, it's about 3600.
Funny that for both, I can't free up any space afterwards, even if I 
delete everything inside the volume.
Can someone more knowledgeable look at these bugs? Unfortunately, I 
don't have a serial port (or second computer with USB port), so I can't 
do any kernel debugging the usual way.
Thanks,
Martin
