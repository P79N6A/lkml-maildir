That will reduce the cost of not traversing the whole process address
space.  But still for a given length, we will need to traverse the PTs.
On a positive side, this interface can give more specific information to
user in terms of page attributes.  I'm fine with this interface if
others are okay.  Andi?

Agreed.

The additional cost of this counter will be long size of extra memory
per segment, an atomic operation when ptl is used and dirtying an
additional cache line.  I overlooked the last two cost factors earlier.
