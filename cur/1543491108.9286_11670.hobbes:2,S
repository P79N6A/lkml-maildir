Good listers..
	I'm having a problem with making a boot disk.
	Running RH 5.2 with 2.2.1 kernel I don't seem to be able to make a 2.2.1 boot
disk, I can make a 2.0.36-0.7.
	In /boot I have the following two files (amongst others) vmLinux-2.0.36-0.7
and zImage {ZImage is the recompiled Kernel I made when I went to 2.2.1}.  
	Mkbootdisk says that I need to add the version number to the end of it.
Seeing as I can make a 2.0.36-0.7 it should be too hard to make a latest
boot.
	Thats where I came unstuck.  I tried {and don't laugh, I'm still learning}
mkbootdisk 2.2.1 (didn't work) mkbootdisk zImage (didn't work), mv zImage
zImage-2.2.1 then mkbootdisk 2.2.1 (didn't work).  I'm out of ideas..
	I checked /proc/version and I'm sure I'm running 2.2.1.
	Can someone please tell me what I doing wrong ?  
	(Hope I'm not being too stupid, and have supplied all the information you
need)..
