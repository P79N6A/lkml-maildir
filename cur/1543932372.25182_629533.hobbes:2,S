Actually, who needs to create device nodes? Just prohibit everyone from
creating them, except "installer" and "udev" personality.
This means removing CAP_MKNOD on a global scale.
(OTOH, both don't need CAP_SYS_ADMIN. Maybe udev needs
CAP_SYS_MODULE...)
Now, stopping people from faking hotplug events is totally another
