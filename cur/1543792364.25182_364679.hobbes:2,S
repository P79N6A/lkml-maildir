Yeah, if we do this, we get rid of the "mount"-like kernel uevents, as
they were in the wrong place.

I haven't had anyone ask for this yet.  It might be a bit harder, as we
would need to have a hook back to sysfs to let userspace know it had
changed.  As long as it was optional and didn't cause any overhead for
everyone that does not need it, I don't see why it could not be added.
All we need now is a patch :)
thanks,
