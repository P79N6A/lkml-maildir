So the external module were fiddeling with CFLAGS which is wrong.
Yes - it worked before by accident.
From Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt:
=====================================================================
--- 3.7 Compilation flags
    EXTRA_CFLAGS, EXTRA_AFLAGS, EXTRA_LDFLAGS, EXTRA_ARFLAGS
        All the EXTRA_ variables apply only to the kbuild makefile
        where they are assigned. The EXTRA_ variables apply to all
        commands executed in the kbuild makefile.
        $(EXTRA_CFLAGS) specifies options for compiling C files with
        $(CC).
        Example:
                # drivers/sound/emu10k1/Makefile
                EXTRA_CFLAGS += -I$(obj)
                ifdef DEBUG
                    EXTRA_CFLAGS += -DEMU10K1_DEBUG
                endif
        This variable is necessary because the top Makefile owns the
        variable $(KBUILD_CFLAGS) and uses it for compilation flags for the
        entire tree.
=====================================================================
Nowhere are the use of CFLAGS documented.
The use of EXTRA_CFLAGS has been working as far back as I remember so
there is no backward compatibility issues to my best knowledge.
Pelase ask the author of the module to either fix it or even better
submit the driver for inclusion because then we will find it during
the review pahse.
But anyway - thanks for reporting an issue related to an external module.
