Hi All,
A new set of uClinux (MMU-less) patches agains 2.5.28.
You can get it at:
http://www.uclinux.org/pub/uClinux/uClinux-2.5.x/linux-2.5.28uc0.patch.gz
Some amount of hacking was required to support the underlying
interrupt/cli/sti changes. But it seems to work pretty well
on my test boards.
Regards
Greg
