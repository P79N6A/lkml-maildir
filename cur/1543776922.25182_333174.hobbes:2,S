I would like to interject an addition data point, and I will NOT be subjective. 
  The nature of the PIT is that it can _hit_ some frequencies better than 
others.  We have had complaints about repeating timers not keeping good time. 
These are not jitter issues, but drift issues.  The standard says we may not 
return early from a timer so any timer will either be on time or late.  The 
amount of lateness depends very much on the HZ value.  Here is what the values 
are for the standard CLOCK_TICK_RATE:
HZ  	TICK RATE	jiffie(ns)	second(ns)	 error (ppbillion)
  100	 1193180	10000000	1000000000	       0
  200	 1193180	 5000098	1000019600	   19600
  250	 1193180	 4000250	1000062500	   62500
  500	 1193180	 1999703	1001851203	 1851203
1000	 1193180	  999848	1000847848	  847848
The jiffie values here are exactly what the kernel uses and are based on the 
best one can do with the PIT hardware.
I am not suggesting any given default HZ, but rather an argumentation of the 
help text that goes with it.  For those who want timers to repeat at one second 
(or multiples there of) this is useful info.
For you enjoyment I have attached the program used to print this.  It allows you 
to try additional values...
