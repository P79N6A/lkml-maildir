There is a problem with this patch. I'm aware of this problem for 
quite some time, but chose to keep the current code.
This IOCTL implementation has been here for many years in all 
revisions of the driver, so I think we should keep it as is, because 
some software could rely on it, and your change will break it. 
And all new code should use ethtool anyway :).
