It seems that you have to analyse your problem a bit more.
There are 5 main types of clusters (or server-farms as you call it):
- parallel computing
- high availability
- load balancing
- storage cluster
- database cluster
Of course these overlap in functionality but so they say :) In many 
cases those goals are achievable with "share nothing" in kernel level: 
lam/mpi, ipvs, hartbeat, lvm etc. Well, about filesystems I am not sure 
at moment :)
Please analyse your need to create "as it was one big machine" because 
maybe it is not the solution you really need.
thanks,
Indrek
