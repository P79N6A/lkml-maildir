If automount is going to be mounting NFS shares for users, I don't see 
how this is out of scope.

Yup.

I could see AFS using these mounttraps, however I don't see any benefit 
for NFS.   If anything, the migration issue is about getting rid of the 
daemon, not mounttraps.  The issues I think Trond is putting forward are:
a) The kernel needs to initiate a remount, but doesn't have nameservice 
functionality.
b) User credentials are needed to perform the initial mount itself 
because some servers don't allow non-authenticated calls to the MOUNT 
program, keeping the system from grabbing a root filehandle.
