And I can say that my Soyo SY-KT600 Ultra (VIA KT600+8237) has ACPI
problems as well. pci=noacpi doesn't help but acpi=off does. It gives
lots of errors that the ACPI tables are buggy when booting claiming
my 8237 SATA controller has gotten IRQ -19 for instance.
Using acpi=off solves the problem. This is with or without the libata
VIA 8237 SATA driver. Without anything it recognizes the chip but
doesn't like using IRQ -19 and doesn't see any disks. With pci=noacpi
it sees the disks but bombs out when trying to get the partition table.
It gets IRQ -19 still there. acpi=off makes it all work.
