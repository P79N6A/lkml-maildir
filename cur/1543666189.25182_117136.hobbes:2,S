I got an opportunity, so the contents of cpuinfo, slabinfo, and meminfo are 
at: 
http://castandcrew.com/~gregory/lkmlstuff/burpr/2.4.20
Hopefully they're useful.
Additionally, I managed to generate an Oops (processed with ksymoops, too) 
while trying to create an LVM snapshot.  The oops and it's 
ksymoops-translated file are up there too.  The oops traces back into the 
VM somewhere.
