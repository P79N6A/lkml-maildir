Hi Kevin.

The problem is that they do NOT create a rule - at least, not a
standard one. Let's take a few examples:
 1. insmod accepts --version but NOT --help
 2. procinfo does not accept either.
 3. pstree does not accept either.
ALL THREE of the above have options to show both help and version, so
that part of the rule has been complied with, but the requirement for
them to use --help and --version have not.

Personally, I would use the following in those circumstances:
 Q> if [ -e /etc/nofrob ]; then
 Q>     alias frob 'echo > /dev/null'
 Q> else
 Q>     alias frob /usr/bin/frob
 Q> fi
I would then just use frob as the command, and allow alias to turn it
into the desired version...

Note that both /bin/false and /bin/true REQUIRE that both --version
and --help are the ONLY option supplied before they act on them. As a
result, this would only be a possible problem on lines where there was
only a single parameter.

True 8-)
