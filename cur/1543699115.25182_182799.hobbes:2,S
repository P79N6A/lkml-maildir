I also tried flashing the BIOS, but that was a complete disaster.
I have a BioStar motherboard (M7NCD Pro), and when I flashed to the 1007
BIOS, I started getting segfaults during init, was unable to log in most
times, and the machine was generally unusable.
When I reflashed to the (old) 0630 BIOS, the above patch worked its
magic.
Incidentally, everyone should stay away from the 1007 BIOS for the
M7NCD Pro.
