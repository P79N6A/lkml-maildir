I know which bug you are talking about. I have a fix already in the BK 
tree. Softcursor.c uses the image drawing function. Unfortunely 
softcursor.c assumes that imageblit always process 8 bit padded data. This 
is not always the case. I noticed this with the rivafb driver. I have a 
fix in the fbdev BK tree. A few more bugs need to be fixed tho for the 
software cursor :-( They are coming.
