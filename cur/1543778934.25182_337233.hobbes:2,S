ok, could you apply the two patches below? The first one implements 
prefetchw_range(), the second one makes use of it to prefetch the 
outgoing stack for writes. We can actually do the current task 
prefetching much earlier, because unlike the next task, we know its 
stack pointer right away, so this patch could have some additional 
benefits.
btw., i'm not totally convinced this is needed, because even in a 
context-switch-intense workload (as DB workloads are), i'd expect the 
outgoing task to still have a hot switch-stack, either due to having 
context-switched recently, or due to having done some deeper kernel 
function call recently. The next task will likely be cache-cold, but the 
current task is usually cache-hot. Maybe not cache-hot to a depth of 528 
bytes, but it needs to be measured: it would be nice to benchmark the 
effects of this particular patch in isolation as well, so that we know 
the breakdown.
