While I think this is a good idea in general:
make bzImage gives this:
make[4]: Leaving directory `/exp/src1/kernels/2.4.23/Desktop/linux-2.4.23/fs/vfat'
make -C xfs fastdep
make: *** xfs: No such file or directory.  Stop.
make: Entering an unknown directorymake: Leaving an unknown directorymake[3]: *** [_sfdep_xfs] Error 2

The main problem?
root:/usr/src/kernels/2.4.23/Desktop/linux-2.4.23# grep -i xfs .config   
# CONFIG_XFS_FS is not set
# CONFIG_XFS_QUOTA is not set
