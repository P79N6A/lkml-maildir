For those not familar with the IXP4xx, the Ethernet drivers are
proprietary and given that there are no other proposed users of this
maclist code there's no need for it in the kernel at this time.

I'm with Adrian on this -- it's a job for userspace.  The storage of the
MAC address isn't something that's necessarily board specific anyway but
could depend on which bootloader is used and/or the bootloader version.

In the specific case of the IXP4xx, you presumably have some userspace
available because you've just loaded the NPE firmware from it, yes?
