I'd consider that a warning sign.
About two years ago, someone with Linux machines posted that they
crashed frequently until one particular employee was fired for
unrelated reasons. That employee was one that strongly preferred
some other kind of system over Linux.
I don't know your sysadmin of course, and it would be very bad to
blindly accuse him of causing crashes... but consider the possibility.
It has happened before.
