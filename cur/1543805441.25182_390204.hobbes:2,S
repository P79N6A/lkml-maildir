On x86_64, available virtual space is huge, so having different red zones can 
spot the fault more easily : If the target of the fault is in the PER_CPU 
redzone given range, we can instantly knows there is still a per_cpu() user 
accessing a non possible cpu area. As the red zone is not mapped at all, no 
page table is setup.
On 32 bits platforms, this is completely different : space is scarse (typical 
User/Kernel split of 3GB/1GB), so we should avoid to reserve even a 32 KB 
redzone. We could do it in DEBUG mode for example. Current interim patch in 
2.6.16-rc1-mm3 is using NULL pointer but this is not a perfect solution since 
the underlying current user process can perfectly map something in this 'zone'.
