Gcc thinks it is a lot smarter than it actually is, in fact. :)
The usual case where it gives a bogus warning is where the value of
one variable is correlated with the defined-ness of another, for
example:
	found = 0;
	for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
		if (a[i] == foo) {
			x = b[i];
			found = 1;
			break;
		}
	}
	if (found)
		bar(x);
Gcc will warn on the use of x when in fact it is perfectly OK, and we
get quite a few of these in compiling a kernel.  At a minimum, I would
like to be able to disable the "may be used uninitialized" warnings
while still getting the "is used uninitialized" warnings.
Paul.
