That might be the case, but your patch makes it very hard to verify.
You don't fix the old code, you just drop in a complete new 
implementation, so you have to explain it a bit more.
What's exactly wrong with old design and why wasn't possible to fix it 
incrementally? How exactly is your new design superior?

For machines where it actually matters, I can only see that calculations 
have gotten more complex and thus slower. You need to provide a little 
more detailed information, why this necessary.

I don't need any practical numbers, I can already see from the code, that 
it's much worse and unless you eliminate the 64bit calculations from the 
fast path, I don't know what you are trying to optimize.

I would seriously suggest you rework the first patch and fix the existing 
code instead or you have to explain why the current code is unfixable, but 
that would require to actually replace the old code. Having two 
alternative implementations is really the worst solution.
John, you are _very_ vague here, could you please go into more detail, why 
you did certain design decisions? "Simplicity" can't be the only reason, 
good perfomance is far more important.
bye, Roman
