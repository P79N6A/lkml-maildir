Tainting is working just like it is supposed to work.   The reduced
support burden for senior Linux maintainers has been a benefit.

The kernel maintainers will decide what's best for Linux.   They're the
ones responsible for overseeing Linux.    But if we're going to change
the message i'd prefer something along the lines of:
"Now loading a non GPL driver.   Please consider supporting vendors that
provide open source drivers for their hardware.  Your kernel will now be
marked as tainted, all this means is that you should send any support
requests to the author of this driver."

Tough.   Why don't you understand that LINUX IS AN OPEN SOURCE
OPERATING SYSTEM?   Linux is about open source; accommodating
closed source modules is way way down the list of priorities.

Good.
