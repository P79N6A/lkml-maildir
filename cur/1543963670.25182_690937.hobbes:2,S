The server is a Sun X4600 with 8 x dual-core CPU's, setup with 64
NFS-threads. The other end of the fiber goes into a switch with gigabit
ports connected to 48 dual-core cpus. The test was done doing a dd on a
4.5GB file from the server to /dev/null on the clients.
The number of contextswitches seems enourmous.. over 120.000 sometimes.
When transmitting around the same amount of data (4xgigabit bonded with
802.3ad) 4x110MB/s the amount of contextswitches only reaches 3-4.000. I
have no idea if this has any relevance.
Should this setup not be able to fill the pipe?
