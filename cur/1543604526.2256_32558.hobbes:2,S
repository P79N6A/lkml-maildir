In article <1002808349.10317.7.camel@thanatos> you write:
| I guess the question is: Which way is more portable?  Is
| "(unsigned long)-1" liable to turn out as something other than
| ~0U?
| 
| If your way of expressing it is more portable then we should
| make the change ... BOTH in pnp_bios.c and in parport_pc.c .
| 
| Opinions?
Does this address any bug present without the cast? If the expression
left of == is unsigned long, ~0U will work, as will (unsigned)~0. But
more to the point, do you mean "minus one" or "all ones" here? While
Linux does not currently run on any machine which is not 2's complement,
I think if you want all ones you should use (unsigned long)~0 as most
portable.
Yes, I have programmed 1's complement machines :-(
