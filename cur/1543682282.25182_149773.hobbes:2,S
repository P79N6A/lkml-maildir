I can't say that I see any of that.
I'm using a G450 (AGP) on a KT400 chipset, XP-2600 cpu.
This is my kernel boot line:
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-260test1ac2 root=/dev/hda1 video=matroxfb:xres:1600,yres:1280,depth:16,pixclock:4116,left:304,right:64,upper:46,lower:1,hslen:192,vslen:3,fv:85 hdb=scsi apm=power-off ide0=ata66
Consoles, X, Xv for watching videos in X - it all works fine.

This works for me.
