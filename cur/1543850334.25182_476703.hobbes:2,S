I'm confused on the discussion:
legal? I don't find how a windo$e driver can be "derived work" of Linux,
and anyway they use a "standard" interface. So it is acceptable for GPL
(IMHO and IANAL). so it is not a legal problem.
I see only a development question:
should we allow untrusted module to know and modify the
"intimate" part of kernel, and cause compability and other large
amount of problems into kernel developers, distribution and users?
So it is a political question, not a legal question!
