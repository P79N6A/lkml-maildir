I noticed you added `m68k-allnoconfig', which fails because of the following
reasons:
  - There's no single CPU type enabled, hence we get:
	#define FPSTATESIZE error no_cpu_type_configured
  - There's no single platform type enabled, hence we get no definition of
    NR_IRQS:
	#error unknown nr of irqs
Well yes, these are all `features' of allnoconfig :-)
Or should we make sure you cannot build invalid configs like this?
