I find it more readable.  And apparently many core kernel hackers thing
the same.

If you look at core code we generally don't do it.  It's not a hard
requirement, but it makes reading the driver and thus finding and fixing
bugs much easier for core developers.

Yes.  In general most places you have to use casts in C are bugs - either
in your code or in the API (e.g. in the Linux timer APIs)

So the frame_hdr is somewhere in iomremapped space?  If so you need to
use the proper interfaces (read* or ioread*) to access it.

I'd have to look over the patch in detail again, but IIRC this is a
resource shortage, in which case not completing the command but returning
busy is the right thing to do.  Let's look over it again in the next
revision.

Don't think so.  You'll get a message about the resets from the midlayer
anyway.

Okay.  I'd suggest putting those DMAable members into a separate struct
that is kmalloced so we have them nicely separated.

->queuemand and the ->eh_*handler routines are called with the midlayers
per-host lock held.  You can of course release and reaquire them inside
these routines (with spin_unlock_irq / spin_lock_irq)
