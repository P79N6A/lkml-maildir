I finaly found the time to test it : result is that 2.6.8-rc4 + 
bk-acpi.patch boots fine. The thermal problem is also gone. SO something 
must corrupt the data used by thermal.c in 2.6.8-rc4-mm1 :-(  Did not 
managed to wake up from S3 once. Will retry to be sure...
I think a minimal check on THRM value should be performed (-129°C) is 
crazy as 150 probably...
