lstat() will tell you if a file is a symlink; if you only walk into
directories, then you're guaranteed not to get into a loop. If you've
got two hardlinks to a directory, how do you make that available in
stat() output, and how does a tree-walking program know which to walk
into? You could do the rsync trick of keeping track of every
device-inode pair you've seen to detect hardlinks, but that's horribly
non-space-efficient on large directories -- particularly bad for
backups.
I could imagine this functionality maybe being useful for system
administrators, but with normal Unixish userspace, it doesn't strike
me as a good idea to give users the ability to create hardlinks to
directories.
