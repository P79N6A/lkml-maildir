This was exactly what happened with 2.6.12 -- more and more memory
used until there was a swap storm and a dead machine.
The 2.6.20 machines haven't been up long enough to know if they're
going to be hit by the same problem, but it seems peculiar to me that
the 2.6.16 machine does not do anything remotely like this. As you can
see in the graphs, the 2.6.16 memory use levels off very quickly, but
2.6.12 keeps dropping until the machine bombs.
The 2.6.20 graph looks like it's heading the same direction as 2.6.12.
I'm going to run drop_caches on the 2.6.20 machines tonight and see
what happens...
