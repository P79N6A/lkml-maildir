Because there is no checksum_t type, lots of places throughout the
kernel store partial checksums in an `int'.  So we can't return the
64-bit partial sum like we'd like, so we do several folds to fit in
32 bits.
We actually return a 17-bit sum -- a fully folded result would
have to go one more round.
