Subject: [PATCH] x86-64 highres/dyntick support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I'm pleased to announce the first cut of the final x86_64
highres/dyntick support, which I did based on Chris Wright's patch set,
which is again based on Arjan van de Ven's initial work:
http://www.tglx.de/projects/hrtimers/2.6.21-git2-x86-64/patches-2.6.21-git2.patch.bz2
Broken out version:
http://www.tglx.de/projects/hrtimers/2.6.21-git2-x86-64/patches-2.6.21-git2.tar.bz2
It applies on top of 2.6.21-git2 and contains the following patches:
# Andi's x86_64 queue (already in -mm and pending mainline merges)
x86_64-2.6.21-git2.patch 
# Outstanding fixups to highres/dyntick core and i386 
# (-mm and mainline pending)
highres-dyntick-avoid-xtime-lock-contention.patch
acpi-keep-tsc-stable-when-lapic-timer-c2-ok-is-set.patch
clocksource-fix-resume-logic.patch
clockevents-fix-resume-logic.patch
# x86_64 dyntick support
x86-64-untangle-hpet-headers.patch
x86-64-drive-set-rtc-mss.patch
i386-move-pit-setup-to-i8253-h.patch
x86-64-remove-dead-code-tsc-c.patch
x86-64-convert-to-clockevents.patch
x86-64-prepare-idle-for-dyntick.patch
x86-64-enable-highres-dyntick.patch
The x86-64-convert-to-clockevents.patch is rather large, but there is no
way to do this incremental. The clockevents conversion has to be done in
one go. 
The x86-64 clockevents patch set overall summary is:
 22 files changed, 631 insertions(+), 1199 deletions(-)
due to sharing the code of PIT and HPET with i386.
I did not dare to tackle sharing apic.c yet, but there is definitely a
chance to get this done some day when I get bored and do a:
# mkdir arch/x86  :)
I'm going to post the x86_64 set for review to LKML once the outstanding
highres/dyntick fixups have hit mainline resp. -mm
To create a highres / dyntick enabled kernel for x86_64:
