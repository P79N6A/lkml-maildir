Look at the original bug report.  There's a bug WB region so any subsequent WC 
mappings via the MTRRs won't work, so you need PAT to do WC (unless you want 
to rewrite all your MTRR settings as Howard has to do now).
Seems like more and more machines are being setup this way, and until we have 
PAT users will have to jump through hoops to get good performance.
