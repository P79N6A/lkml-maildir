If you have not got the page in the cache, then the new page will
be allocated with PG_arch_1 bit off.
You are going to flush pages which are read by HW DMA, i.e. the L2I
of Montecito does not keep old lines for those pages anyway.
...->a_ops->readpage() of "L2I safe" file systems should set PG_arch_1
if the CPU is ia64 and it has got separate L2I.
On the other hand, arch. independent file systems should not play with
PG_arch_1.
The base kernel should export a macro for the file systems...
Thanks,
