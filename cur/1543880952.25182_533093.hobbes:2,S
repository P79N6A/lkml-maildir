Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/3] Clean up x86 CPU feature setup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

x86 CPU feature flag setup has become impossible to debug.
Every user just does set_bit()/clear_bit() or writes the
entire set to change the flags, so there's no way to trace
how they're being set.
This patchset creates an API and debug messages for tracking
how the flags get set. It's not nearly done, but I want to
know whether or not to continue.
