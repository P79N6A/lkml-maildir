Greg,
A few quick comments, there might be more, I just spotted these two
points quickly:
1) Please update the struct file_operations assignments to use
   .owner THIS_MODULE, etc. instead of owner:
2) Always check the return values from copy_from_user and copy_to_user
   to avoid userland feeing you bogus pointers.
Jes
