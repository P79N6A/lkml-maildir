I tried installing a machine that previously was running redhat 7.3 with 
2.4.something with debian and 2.6 with tg3 driver and it just wouldn't 
even complete the install (debian installer didn't get past detecting the 
hardware). Same debian install with 2.4 worked perfectly.

I tried 2.6.11.2 but ran into weird TCP problems as well (intermittent 
timeouts and stalls), 2.6.8.1 works perfectly.
