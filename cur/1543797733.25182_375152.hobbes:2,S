I don't see any justification for MTD_OBSOLETE_CHIPS depending on
BROKEN. That option covers a few of the obsolete chip drivers which
people shouldn't be using any more -- and I'm perfectly willing to
believe that one or two of those don't work any more, but if that's the
case then those individual drivers ought to be marked BROKEN (or just
removed). We shouldn't mark MTD_OBSOLETE_CHIPS broken.
I'd like to see the collie_defconfig updated to use the appropriate CFI
driver back end.
