I remember talking with people about using madvise and/or mmap flags to set 
the attributes correctly, but I don't remember whether it was a good idea or 
not...
The advantage of a specific post-mmap call is that it would make setting the 
attribute types a little easier, so either ioctl or madvise seems preferable 
to mmapping over and over with different flags until you get the mapping.
