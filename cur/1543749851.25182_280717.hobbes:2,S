If I am not mistaken, a failure on spin_trylock + the test on
xmit_lock_owner imply that it is safe to directly handle the
queue. It means that qdisc_run() has been interrupted on the
current cpu and the other paths seem fine as well. Counter-example
is welcome (no joke).
Of course the patch is completely ugly and violates any layering
principle one could think of. It was not submitted for inclusion :o)

I'd expect it to deadlock if dev_queue_xmit -> qdisc_run is interrupted
on the current cpu and a printk is issued as dev->queue_lock will have
been taken elsewhere.
