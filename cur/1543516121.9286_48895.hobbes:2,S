And *that* is a good reason (from my perspective) not to distribute a
split kernel.  egcs (now gcc) does this -- you can download either the
whole release or the base plus any of various language frontends as
separate tarballs.  Trouble is, if you then try patching an
"incomplete" tree with a "complete" patch file you will get loads of
questions and rejects for directories and files that don't exist.
While there may be a patch flag to turn this behavior off, I never
found it; I gave up on this whole approach and now always download the
complete egcs/gcc tarball when needed.
