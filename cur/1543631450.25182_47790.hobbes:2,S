That's just a rampant printk - no real problem.  The
3c59x update was, err, somewhat unexpected.  I've actually
asked Marcelo to back out to the 2.4.18 version because
there has been one report of a transceiver selection failure
with the 2.4.19-pre8 driver.
The thing's totally fragile, I'm afraid.  It supports 32 different
devices, of which I have five.  If you change anything, you break
something, and for some types of cards it takes months before
you hear about the breakage.
