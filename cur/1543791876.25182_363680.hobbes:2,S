I don't remember a difference of more than (roughly) 30 percentage
points even on first generation Itaniums (using hugetlb vs normal
pages). And few more percentage points when walker was disabled. Over
time the page table walker on IA-64 has gotten more aggressive.
...though I believe that 30% is a lot of performance.
