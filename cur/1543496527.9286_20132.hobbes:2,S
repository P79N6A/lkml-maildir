No: The RTC is a piece of hardware that is addressed directly as the 
serial ports and disc controllers. No need for a BIOS.

I only found this on a quick scan:
!
! Read the CMOS clock. Return the seconds in al
!
gettime:
        push    cx
        mov     ah,#0x02
        int     0x1a
        mov     al,dh                   ! dh contains the seconds
        and     al,#0x0f
        mov     ah,dh
        mov     cl,#0x04
        shr     ah,cl
        aad
        pop     cx
        ret
and This will be against your theory:
__initfunc(void time_init(void))
{
        xtime.tv_sec = get_cmos_time();
        xtime.tv_usec = 0;
...

If the bit is unchanged by other OSes it could be used. I doubt it.

Yes and one version repeatedly changed time back one hour. I agree 
that the RTC should be set to UTC, but I'd like to have the correct 
time in DOSish systems too.
