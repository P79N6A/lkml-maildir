If we're not writing to the RTC on suspend, then I believe the drift is
capped.  For some consumer products, 2 seconds of drift is OK.
Nigel, does the RTC get written to, or just read, on suspend?
Also, I'm worried about the clock appearing to run backwards over a suspend.
Unless a suspend/resume cycle took less than 1 second, I don't think this could
happen.  Is that right?
