The changes to drivers/ieee1394/Makefile broke the compilation at least 
when compiling the ieee1394 code statically into the kernel:
1. Nothing gets built in drivers/ieee1394.
2. The final linking fails with the following error:
<--  snip  -->
...
        -o vmlinux
ld: cannot open drivers/ieee1394/ieee1394drv.o: No such file or directory
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
