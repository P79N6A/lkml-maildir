Hi.. I follow your instruction, but I encounter this issue, my kernel need
to be upgrade? MAy I know how to determine the current kernel version and
how to upgrade it?? 
[root@guava /root]# iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dst 1.1.1.160 -i
eth1 -j D
NAT --to-destination 192.168.200.2
iptables v1.1.1: can't initialize iptables table `nat': iptables who? (do
you need to insm
od?)
Perhaps iptables or your kernel needs to be upgraded.
[root@guava simc]# rpm -ivh iptables-1_2_0-6_i386.rpm
error: failed dependencies:
        kernel >= 2.4.0 is needed by iptables-1.2.0-6

This isn't really a kernel question. I think you'd better ask it on some
linux network list/newsgroup. But here's an answer anyway....
You could add 1.1.1.160 to eth0:
   ip addr add 1.1.1.160 dev eth0
and then use NAT to redirect these to the webserver:
   iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dst 1.1.1.160 -i eth1 -j
DNAT --to-destination 192.168.200.2
This should work, AFAIK, but i didn't try it myself. You could also try to
use the arp command (see 'man arp'), but i don't know exactly how that
works.
Good luck!
Michel Wilson.
