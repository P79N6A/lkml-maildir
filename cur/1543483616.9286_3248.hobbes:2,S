I have to clients booting linux using nfs-root. Under 2.0.36 and ago, it
works well. But under 2.2.x it works terrible slow (over 1 hour to boot).
The two clients don't have anything in common. 
Server: P54C-200, 128MB, 3C900 (10B2), 3C905B (100BTX)
Client 1: 486DX/2-66, 20MB, NE2000-Compatible (Jumpered)
Client 2: K6-2-333, 64MB, 3C905
During 2.2.1 booting, the network doesn't get over 256KBit/s.
With kind regards
