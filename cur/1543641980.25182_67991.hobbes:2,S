With the lock held, you mean? Depends on policy. There are two
implemented at present:
   a) show all errors
   b) hide all errors
In case b) the lock will continue to be held until the other
node comes back up. In case a) the lock will be abandoned after
timeout, and pending requests will be errored.
I'll explore the ramifications later.
