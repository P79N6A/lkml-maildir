The new pci_domain_nr() is good for adding the PCI domain number to
the /sys/devices/pciN/* names, but I think that's not the proper
representation. It should really be
  /sys/devices/pci-domainN/pciN/*
So we can pave the way for when we'll stop play bus number tricks and
actually have overlapping PCI bus numbers between domains. (I don't plan
to do that immediately because that would break userland & /proc/bus/pci
backward compatiblity)
What do you think ?
Ben.
