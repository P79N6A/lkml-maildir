Sysrq+T itself might work, it's just a matter to get to the console! If you can
get to a con, I'm sure it does, because hitting the keys generates an interrupt
which will be delivered to the sysrq code if interrupts are not currently
disabled. So even if your box appears totally dead, you'd be surprised when you
hit Sysrq+B.
To get any data, I'd start a vnc server on it, and all graphical apps in it,
and let the machine itself stay on tty10 (or wherever kernel output goes), and
then try hitting Sysrq+T when it hangs.
