No page lock please. Generally, Ocfs2 wants to order cluster locks outside
of page locks. Also, the sparse b-tree support I'm working on right now will
need to be able to allocate in ->page_mkwrite() which would become very
nasty if we came in with the page lock - aside from the additional cluster
locks taken, ocfs2 will want to zero some adjacent pages (because we support
atomic allocation up to 1 meg).
Thanks,
