My test case is Debian's "aptitude update" running once an hour, and
it was always the same file getting corrupted. With 2.6.19, I had this
corruption like every third hour (but -only- if run from cron, running
from a shell was always fine), data=writeback made the issue disappear
for about two days before I booted into 2.6.19.1 without
data=writeback (defaults chosen then), after which the issue only
shows up like every other day.
So, I feel like out of the loop since rtorrent seems much better in
reproducing this.
I notice, though, that both aptitude and rtorrent do downloads from
the net, so there might be a relation to tcp/ip and/or the network
driver. My box has a Linksys NC100 network card running with the tulip
driver.
Greetings
Marc
