Ok, I did that.
The device now works! But, it still comes up as eth2 instead of eth0,
even though it's first detected as eth0. There are no other network
interfaces according to ifconfig -a. 
I've attached the entire dmesg, which ends with messages from me
unloading and reloading the r8169 module again. If you need anything else,
just let me know.
Best regards,
Bram
