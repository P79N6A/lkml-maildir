Doesn't seem to fix it. Now that I've to type blinding, I realised
that the text-console is about 1/20 of the whole screen size. If I
hold on to ENTER key, I could see the screen scroll. But sometimes,
the screen would just be blank and nothing shown. Whatever it is, I
could still type "startx" to go into X.
Thanks,
Jeff.
