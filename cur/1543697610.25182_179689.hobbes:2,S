Subject: What exactly are the issues with 2.6.0-test10 preempt?

I saw in Linus' 2.6.0-test10 announcement that preempt is suffering from some
problems and should not be used. However, I am currently running 2.6.0-test10
with CONFIG_PREEMPT=y and nothing has appeared yet. To see if the problem appeared
under stress, I started an A/V trailer playback with mplayer and then ran the
find command on both my home directory and the 2.6.0-test10 kernel source directory,
with the expected result - mplayer did not skip, neither find invocation broke,
and there were no nasty errors in dmesg.
So what exactly is the problem?
I can provide more system info on request.
TIA
Brad
