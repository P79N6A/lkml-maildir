Check out oprofile:
in kernel tree, Documentation/basic_profiling.txt (2.6.x)
Basic in-kernel profiling (older version, before oprofile)
does not work with loadable modules, just with in-kernel code.
You could use this if you build your driver in-kernel.
There are also some performance-counter patches, but
I don't know how to use them [if your h/w supports them].

MOTD:  Always include version info.
(Again.  Sometimes I think ln -s /usr/src/linux/.config .signature)
