Subject: percularity with nfs serving on 2.2.5

I installed redhat 6.0 (2.2.5).
After much work, I got kernel based nfsd to work...(it seems
removed rpc.statd and rpc.rquotad did the trick...I haven't
spent time to figure out exactly what was wrong).
I have a whole tree of filesystems under /usr/local.
When I mount /usr/local onto /usr/local on another machine, I can't
see these other file systems.
However, I can traverse them in amd via /net/<host>/usr/local/src/misc (etc.)
Any ideas/what to try...
