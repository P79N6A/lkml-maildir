   Yes I agree, mixing signed and unsigned arithmetic is evil... Doesn't
   gcc have a flag for unsafe signed/unsigned mixtures ?
   Would you consider this patch (or a variant) for inclusion ?
I would accept a patch which made the code set fdmax <= 0 when
(msg->msg_controllen < (sizeof(struct cmsghdr) + sizeof(int)))
because it is the sole reason this bug exists at all.
