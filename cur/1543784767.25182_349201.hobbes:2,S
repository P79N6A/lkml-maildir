 * Discover logical units present in the SCSI device.  I'd like this
 * to be moved to SCSI Core, but SCSI Core has no concept of a "SCSI
 * device with a SCSI Target port".  A SCSI device with a SCSI Target
 * port is a device which the _transport_ found, but other than that,
 * the transport has little or _no_ knowledge about the device.
 * Ideally, a LLDD would register a "SCSI device with a SCSI Target
 * port" with SCSI Core and then SCSI Core would do LU discovery of
 * that device.
So what does this mean except "Luben tries to impress everyone with
standards gibberish, at the same time ignoring we soluitions that
work despite maybe not 100% elegant".
Sure, we'd like to move away from needing the ->id target id specifier.
But right now we need it, even you're code sets it in over-complicated
ways.  But if you send a nice patch to get rid everyone will be happy.
