Hmm, in my experience people hardly ever read detailed comments even 
when they are well-written. Perhaps if you called the function 
imprecise_scale or coarse_scale, it might ring a bell.
Besides that functions should do one thing and do that *well*[1]. Well, 
I'm usually not too dogmatic, but this function breaks the second rule
beyond what I find acceptable.

Ok, I'll give it a try this week-end (PPC, i386 and all 64 bit should 
archs should be trivial).

[1] Documentation/CodingStyle, which also claims that functions should 
be short and *sweet*. Well, I found the patch far too bitter ;-).
