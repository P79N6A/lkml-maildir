Christophs patches are an extremly useful cleanup and can stand on their
own.  Right now PAGE_CACHE_SIZE and friends are in there and now one can
keep them distinct because their useage is not clear at all.  By making
the macros per-mapping at least the useage is clear.
That beeing said we should do a full conversion so that PAGE_CACHE_SIZE
just goes away, otherwise the whole excercise is rather pointless.
