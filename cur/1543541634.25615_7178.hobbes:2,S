Du to my ADSL connection to the net, I have to use a test4
kernel or later. Netither test4 or test6 is able to print.
I get a printer-offline? error from lpq !
Can anyone help ? The Linux system is an partially 
upgraded (beta) RedHat 6.2.
Also:
The test6 kernel compiles OK, but modules_install
dont install all the modules ??? Weird !
Anyone ?
Regards
John
