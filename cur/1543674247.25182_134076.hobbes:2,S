Ok, second guess: they've kept the 0x41-44 for INTA-INTD and just added 
the several onboard USB root-HC's at 0x6* - which might also explain if 
you need bit 6 set. Well, it seems we'd really need the docs.

Well, trolling or not, when I submitted the current sis pci irq routing 
stuff it was based on existing documentation for the 85C503 isa-bridge 
with pci router function (as used in the 5595 chipset).
We were also looking at a number of routing tables from different people 
to get the stuff right - given the different ideas vendors have about link 
values. IIRC it was around 2.4.0 release and we also had some confirmation 
from somebody at SiS before Linus applied it.
I've no idea about docs for the 650 chipset, sorry.
