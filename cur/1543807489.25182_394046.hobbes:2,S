While I agree with you, David and Brian that this would be much nicer
for driver writers to know that the page,offset,length in the sg list
would not be touched by map_sg, I am surprised that you didn't say so
in DMA-API.txt, and said only that map_sg would destroy information
there.  x86_64 seems to conform to that destruction!

I don't quite get that, but whatever, it would be a good idea to cc Andi.

Okay, cc'd to linux-arch also.  The one thing I have checked is that the
coalescing architectures (if I actually got them right) do all declare
a dma_length (perhaps differently named) distinct from input length,
so wouldn't need that added.  Although I can see that x86_64 does
modify the page,offset,length fields we'd prefer it not to, I didn't
find any of the architecture's coalescing routines easy to follow,
and would hesitate to declare any of them safe in this regard.
I'd better also forward my original mail on the fix to Ryan's bug
to Andi and linux-arch also.
