It's a 100% reproducible oops on Sparc (with FireWire controller) for
2.6.23 and 2.6.24 kernels, but not 2.6.22.  The reporter confirmed that
the bug also happens
  - with plain 2.6.24-rc5,
  - with 2.6.23.y and the firewire subsystem fully reverted to that of
    2.6.22.
This has also been reported independently once before against
2.6.23-rc3,

 in August.

[...]
The fault happens due to dma_sync_single_for_device() which
drivers/firewire/fw-ohci.c calls in ar_context_add_page() when still
being in its pci_probe method.  I suspect that --- at least on Sparc and
after 2.6.22 --- it is not possible anymore to use dma_sync_* before the
pci_device's or device's probe was finished.
Would that be a bug in the Sparc platform code?  Or a bug in driver core
code or in PCI code?  Or am I expected to refrain from dma_sync_* calls
until after the probe returned?
(Doing the latter might be tricky, but I suspect that the AR buffers in
fw-ohci would generally be better off using coherent allocations.  The
DMA mapping and syncing in this part of fw-ohci is currently slightly
messy.)
Thanks for any comments,
