You should pay more attention, the real thing is on the second phrase:
"An ARP request is discarded if the source IP address is not in the

And you can just use other OS and solve the problem without messing
with firewalling and mangling techniques.
Maybe the "favourite network religion" should be called as "RedHat
favourite network religion"?
Or maybe it should be called... "Linux approaching Microsoft", as both

Linux versus all other OSes and systems (Cisco, Foundry, ...)
It's clear this is not MY religious war... maybe others war.... I don't
