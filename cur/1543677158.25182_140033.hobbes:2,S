This is perhaps a related problem:  I just noticed that if I have a
firewire drive plugged in at boot, the SBP2 driver detects it during
boot:
ohci1394_0: OHCI-1394 1.0 (PCI): IRQ=[10]  MMIO=[e8201000-e82017ff]  Max Packet=[2048]
scsi0 : SCSI emulation for IEEE-1394 SBP-2 Devices
ieee1394: sbp2: Logged into SBP-2 device
ieee1394: sbp2: Node[00:1023]: Max speed [S400] - Max payload [2048]
  Vendor: Maxtor 4  Model: A250J8            Rev:     
  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 06
ieee1394: Node added: ID:BUS[0-00:1023]  GUID[0004830000002cb3]
ieee1394: Host added: ID:BUS[0-01:1023]  GUID[0040630000001c47]
But, the drive itself (/dev/sda) and any partitions on it don't show up
in /proc/partitions until I mount one of them or perform some sort of
other access to the drive, like running fdisk on it.  
To me, this seems to be a bug.  Or is it actually by design?
