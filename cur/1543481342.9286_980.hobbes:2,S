  Hi, all. I'm pleased to announce the first version of my MSR
(Model-Specific Register) and PMC (Performance Monitoring Counter)
kernel patch. This patch provides simple device driver interfaces to
the MSRs and PMCs on your CPU (currently Intel only, but hopefully
that will change: contributions welcome:-). The patch appears quite
robust (even for a v1 release). I expect changes in the area of
support for non-Intel x86 processors and other architectures.
It is my hope that the device driver interfaces are sufficiently
generic that they will be appropriate for other CPU architectures. I'd
welcome feedback from the non-x86 hackers out there.
The idea behind this patch is to provide the basic minimum services
needed to allow userspace access to MSRs and PMCs. I've also written a
user space programming library which is designed to give easy access
to the facilities provided by the kernel drivers, and provides the
same programming interface to MSRs as in the kernel. This means that
writing MSR drivers can be done in user space and once tested can be
wrapped up in a kernel driver.
The patch and documentation is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
This also points to the user space programming library and a simple
utility (scanmsr) which reads and displays all your MSRs.
This is against 2.2.0-pre9.
Note that the patch requires a devfs kernel.
				Regards,
					Richard....
