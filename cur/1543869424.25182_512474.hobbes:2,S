Subject: radeon breaks with clocksource_jiffies

While probeing PLL information via radeon_get_pllinfo(), it does a
"gettimeofday(); do_something(); gettimeofday();" type sequence
explicitly with interrupts disabled, so ends up with a zero
measurement which then results in a bunch of divisions by zero.
We should decide whether gettimeofday() can be expected to advance with
interrupts disabled, or that clocksource_jiffies is simply invalid because
of this behavior.
