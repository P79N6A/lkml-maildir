Well, of course I forgot one important detail: The kernel version. This
is a 2.6.14 with additional patches for CardMan 4000 support (as posted
on this list by Harald Welte), updated ipw2200 support (from
ipw2200.sourceforge.net) and btsco bluetooth headset support (from
bluetooth-alsa.sourceforge.net).
By now, I did an e2fsck which removed the ext3 journal and recovered the
ext2 without problems - unfortunately I don't have an easy way to verify
if files are corrupted, but up to now everything looks fine.
