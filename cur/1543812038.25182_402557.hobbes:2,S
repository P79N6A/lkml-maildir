That's tip-of-linus-tree a day or so after -rc5.

I don't think there's much point in that - the sysfs-topology code went in
on Feb 15.
If 2.6.16-rc5+linus.patch works and
2.6.16-rc5+linus.patch+gregkh-driver-allow-sysfs-attribute-files-to-be-pollable.patch
crashes then we have a pretty good idea of where to look.
