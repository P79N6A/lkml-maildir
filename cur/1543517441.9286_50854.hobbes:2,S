If, at the point, one task discovered that a lock was not obtained and
subtracted its key, user-code could execute "invlpg", forcing what
was written to appear to another CPU, resolving the issue. The
problem is that user-mode code isn't allowed, even under iopl(3) to
use that instruction. I will experiment with a "far" jump to see if
I can do the same thing.
In the kernel, everything is easy. Just use a spin-lock, but that's
not the point. What I need to do is let user-mode code access a
shared-memory board that has NVRAM values that 'eventually' take effect.
Currently, the maximum rate at which I can write a word is the HZ
rate (100 Hz) because the CPU dosn't seem to "know" it's been written
until a context-switch occurs, invalidating the cache.
Currently, if you were to do the trivial:
	*ptr = shared_memory;
	while (!*ptr)
             ;
This will loop forever, even when hardware writes non-zero to shared
memory. This is because the CPU "knows" that it didn't write something
there since the last time it read, so the data from the last read remains
in its cache, never updated. Once a task-switch occurs, the loop
will be broken. However, this limits the maximum data-change-rate
to 100 Hz (the task-switch time).
I attempted to emulate the same thing in software. Many reviewing
the software didn't understand what it was supposed to do (they
read the code, not the text).
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
