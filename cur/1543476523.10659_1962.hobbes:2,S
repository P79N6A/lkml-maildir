The restrictions are consistent with safety requirements when using a "true" 
vfork(), so Solaris's implementation is valid.  SUS is simply saying that 
vfork() *may* be fork() but *might* be something weirder (i.e. the silly 
workaround for early VAX broken copy-on-write that some people on this list 
think is a good thing).

   Name
     vfork - spawn new process in a virtual memory-efficient way
   Syntax
     pid = vfork()
     int pid;
   Description
     The vfork can be used to create new processes without fully copying the
     address space of the old process, which is inefficient in a paged
     environment.  It is useful when the purpose of fork would have been to
     create a new system context for an execve.  The vfork system call
     differs from fork in that the child borrows the parent's memory and
     thread of control until a call to execve or an exit (either by a call to
     exit(2) or abnormally.) The parent process is suspended while the child
     is using its resources.
     The vfork system call returns a value of zero (0) in the child's context
     and, later, the pid of the child in the parent's context.
     The vfork system call can normally be used just like fork.  It does not
     work, however, to return while running in the childs context from the
     procedure which called vfork, because the eventual return from vfork
     would then return to a nonexistent stack frame.  Be careful, also, to
     call _exit rather than exit if you cannot call execve, because exit will
     flush and close standard I/O channels and thereby cause problems in the
     parent process's standard I/O data structures.  Even with fork it is
     wrong to call exit, because buffered data would then be flushed twice.
   Restrictions
     To avoid a possible deadlock situation, processes which are children in
     the middle of a vfork are never sent SIGTTOU or SIGTTIN signals.
     Rather, output or ioctls are allowed, and input attempts result in an
     end-of-file indication.
   Diagnostics
     Same as for fork.
