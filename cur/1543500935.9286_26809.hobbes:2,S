Hi,
my 1st posting on this list - please forgive
if I violate any of the unwritten rules of the list.
Here's the setup.  Solaris 2.5 machine as NFS server,
Linux 2.2.5 machine as NFS client.  When compiling
something on Linux machine, some output files get corrupted.
The above is the only server-client combination for which
data corruption is observed.
Thanks 
Igor
