I knew my performance hit had to be coming from somewhere...
I'm using an MSI K7T Pro mtherboard (KT133 chipset) and a Voodoo3 2000. 
I can't seem to set bus mastering on the AGP card at all.  This does not
work:
setpci -s 01:00.0 4.w=0007 (setpci -s 01:00.0 4.w gives me 0003)
Nor does:
setpci -s 01:00.0 COMMAND=0007
No permutation of this works.  No error messages are returned, but the
register remains unchanged at 3.  I have tried using -H1 and -H2, to no
avail (-H2 doesn't even get there, complaining about something on the
normal PCI bus).  I have tried this with the BIOS set on "PnP OS" and
off, with no difference.  My guess is that this is a motherboard
specific problem (broken BIOS, anyone), though I don't think I've heard
of a broken BIOS causing unwriteable PCI config registers.  For what
it's worth, I've attached the output of 'lspci -vv -s 0:1.0' (the AGP
host bridge) and 'lspci -vv -s 1:0.0' (the card).
Thanks for any help you may have...00:01.0 PCI bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8363/8365 [KT133/KM133 AGP] (prog-if 00 [Normal decode])
