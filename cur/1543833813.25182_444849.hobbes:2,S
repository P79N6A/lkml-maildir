Kernel panic is _NEVER_ acceptable.
I've seen loads in the couple hundreds with no problem.
However you actually have a mce_panic() crash here.
Make sure to figure out why this Machine Check Exception got raised,
otherwise you might hose the box if you continue without investigation.
It could easily be due to mal-working CPU fan etc.pp., especially since it
happened exactly while you stress-tested the machine.

Read up on MCE debugging methods on Linux or so, that should hopefully help.
Good luck!
