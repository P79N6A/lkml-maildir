You are in for the same shock if you the FPU is in non MMX mode. Think of
the case when all stack entries are marked valid in the interrupted
process: stack overflow on the first fld.
Or alernatively show me how you could simplify the signal delivery FPU
logic for non MMX processor.
Answer: you can't. I still stand by my statement that MMX is
completely irrelevant and does not add any special case.

Better than this, they made it completely transparent.
