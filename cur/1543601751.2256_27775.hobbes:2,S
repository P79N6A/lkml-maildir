Actually, it _may_ even make performance worse (hard to say).  Consider
the case where the "young" dirty buffers are in the same area of the
disk as the "old" dirty buffers.  Once you are forced to write the "old"
buffers, you pretty much get to write the new buffers for free (low seek
overhead).  They _could_ be merged in the elevator code.
Sadly, it is hard to tell whether this is possible or not, because the
code to do these things live in different places.  Maybe we could have
an "optimistic" elevator merge, which only added "young" buffers if
they merged with other old buffers.
Cheers, Andreas
