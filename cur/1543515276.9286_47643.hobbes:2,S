Assumptions alone are not enough, you need to set exactly one of
M_OBJS, MX_OBJS, MI_OBJS and MIX_OBJS.

See my patch earlier in this thread to add directory /independent,
automatically include independent makefile fragments and tie the whole
thing into the kernel Makefile structure.  That together with
automatically setting one of M, MX, MI or MIX_OBJS takes care of
modversions and genksyms.
