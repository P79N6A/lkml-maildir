Well, the pointer seems to be very happy when jumping into the (mostly) upper
right corner. Then it seems like movement and clicks somehow get swallowed
away or stacked and after that get issued in a) either wrong order or b) wrong.
Moreover, even if I didn't click any button (including btn 4 + 5 for wheel
up/down) the mouse clicks into the window what often opens context menus.
Sometimes it then even clicks in. Once it logged me off that way from GNOME
because selecting the entry from the menu and hit 'Log out'. Summary: unusable.
Let me repeat this with a clean 2.6.16-rc1 install without any patches and
resync_timing of 5 tonite. I'll send the whole kern.log part from gdm login (the
agpgart lines) until the mouse jumps then.
