Which is a very important thing.  You have to keep in mind that
reads and writes are fundamentally different operations since
the majority of the writes happen asynchronously while the program
continues running, while the majority of reads are synchronous and
your program will block while the read is going on.
Because of this it is also much easier to do writes in large chunks
than it is to do reads in large chunks, because with writes you
know exactly what data you're going to write while you can't know
which data you'll need to read next.

Why would read-latency hurt the async-io benchmark ?
Whether the IO is synchronous or asynchronous shouldn't matter much,
if you do a read you still need to wait for the data to be read in
before you can process it while the data you write is still in memory
and can be used over and over again.
What is the big difference with asynchronous IO that removes the big
asymetry between reads and writes ?

Any reasons in particular or just a gut feeling ?
