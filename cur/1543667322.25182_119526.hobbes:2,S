Hi Alan,
Long ago, about 2.5.50 or so, I posted here about the ppa
Iomega parallel-port Zip drive driver causing a kernel panic.
I know that the ppa driver isn't your baby, but it now is
really the only obstacle preventing me from adopting the
2.5 kernel, which otherwise seems great for my purposes.
If I compile ppa into the kernel it causes a panic at boot.
If I compile it as a module it still causes error messages
when loaded, and doesn't work properly.
Is there something you can do to get this driver working --
or a fire you can light under someone else who could make
the appropriate fixes?
Thanks for all the wonderful work you do for us open-source
fans!
