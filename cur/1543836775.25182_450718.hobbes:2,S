32bit works for me too, but x86-64 does. Strangely it seems to somehow
reenter head64 copy_boot_data. Perhaps stack gets smashed somehow?
It goes into an endless loop of:
Bootdata ok (command line is ip=dhcp nfsroot=10.23.204.1:/home/nfsroot/gaston root=/dev/nfs debug vga=0x0f07 rw pci=noacpi earlyprintk=serial,ttyS0,115200 console=ttyS0,115200 earlyprintk=serial,ttyS0,115200 console=tty0 BOOT_IMAGE=bzImage )
Bootdata ok (command line is ip=dhcp nfsroot=10.23.204.1:/home/nfsroot/gaston root=/dev/nfs debug vga=0x0f07 rw pci=noacpi earlyprintk=serial,ttyS0,115200 console=ttyS0,115200 earlyprintk=serial,ttyS0,115200 console=tty0 BOOT_IMAGE=bzImage )
Bootdata ok (command line is ip=dhcp nfsroot=10.23.204.1:/home/nfsroot/gaston root=/dev/nfs debug vga=0x0f07 rw pci=noacpi earlyprintk=serial,ttyS0,115200 console=ttyS0,115200 earlyprintk=serial,ttyS0,115200 console=tty0 BOOT_IMAGE=bzImage )
etc.
That is with all =s removed in early_params (i got that wrong in a lot of cases
-- the only option I tested was apic which didn't have it)
