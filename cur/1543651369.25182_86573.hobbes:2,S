| Now all you need is the users to know "make defconfig". I compile kernels since 1.2.13, but I didn't know the option till today. Sure, my fault, but I'm sure I'm not the only one.

so while some people are attempting to "fix" this with
defconfig or mostlikelyconfig, I'd like to remind people
of the post-halloween doc from Dave Jones.  He addresses
this stuff in there.  Does it possibly need even more
emphasis there?  and stronger hints for people to at
least browse it before using 2.5.x for the first time?
