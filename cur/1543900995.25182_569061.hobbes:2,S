rdinit is supposed to do a different job from /sbin/init, therefore it
will not do the security callbacks the original code would do.
And besides that, it feels like turning the wrong knob for that task.

It just missed it's own funeral:
"Obsolete root change mechanism
 ------------------------------
 The following mechanism was used before the introduction of pivot_root.
 Current kernels still support it, but you should _not_ rely on its
 continued availability." (Documentation/initrd.txt)
I don't insist on changing the default, it was just a logical step from 
preparing initramfs to hold a system.
