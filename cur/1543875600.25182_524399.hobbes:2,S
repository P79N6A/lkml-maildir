What is the problem? You have cache misses on the the hash table
or are the instructions really an issue on a modern CPU?
e.g. i out of lined virt_to_page to save space, but it could be probably
inlined again if it was severly time critical.

I think it would be better to have a somewhat generic kmap_caching() 
or similar interface that could be used by more subsystems.
