Hello, Kosaki-san:
This was my doing.  I left the default == NO during
development/experimemental stage so that one would have to take explicit
action to enable this function.  If the feature makes it into mainline
and we decide that the default should be 'yes', that will be an easy
change.
Thanks for looking at this,
