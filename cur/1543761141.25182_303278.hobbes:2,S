Hi Bernardo (et al).  Apologies - I've not been reading my account for
a wee while.  Then again, I probably don't have much useful to add to
the debate right now ;-)

Hmm, I will infer from a previous email you sent that you mean 766_FC3
for the "from" kernel.

766 -> 770 sounds like a "small" (ish) number of patches to check, if
we're lucky.  Did you wade through 'em all yet?  Any smoking guns?
Regards,
Neil
PS: oh bugger, just remembered that I also reproduced my bug with a
2.6.8 kernel on the server; admittedly though it was an FC2 kernel so
who knows what extra patches it had.
