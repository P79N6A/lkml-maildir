The El Torito spec has 4 options for emulation mode: 1.2, 1.44, or 2.88
MB floppy or hard drive.  There is also another mode - raw CD (where x
number of sectors, up to 640K worth, are read into RAM and then just
run).  This mode doesn't emulate a floppy or hard drive.
Now, I don't know what is actually _implemented_, but that is what the
spec says.  It also has provisions for multi-image boot.  It would be
nice if there was a way to call back to the real mode BIOS for things
like this (because then you _could_ load more).  I know it would be an
ugly hack, but it would work for things like this.
BTW: I found the spec on the web at

I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
