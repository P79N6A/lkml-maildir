If the code is truly safe on older systems, what I think makes more
sense is merging it without a configure option and having DMA-capable
systems use DMA CD-audio and older systems fall back to PIO.
It seems wiser to me to support something entirely as correct and sane
or consider it not an issue.  This is not a separate feature, for
example like IDE itself which should be an option, but an evolutionary
feature of which we should just do it.
This would clean up all those nasty ifdefs and perhaps we could
generalize the two codepaths together, further reducing size.
I like the patch... up for my idea for 2.5?
I wonder what akpm thinks..
