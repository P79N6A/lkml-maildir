Yes, the deleted (prefer /.deleted or similar) directory would _have_ to
be per mount point for a few reasons:
1) speed - copying all deleted files across mountpoints would be _slow_.
2) space - you would have to have a _huge_ root directory otherwise.
3) locality - need to handle network filesystems properly (e.g. being able
              to undelete a file on a network fs if it was deleted on a
	      different host).
While I've seen this "change unlink in libc" suggestion many, many times
I don't think I've ever seen it implemented.  Is it just because the people
who can do it don't want to, and by the time the people who want it can
implement it they don't want it anymore?
Cheers, Andreas
