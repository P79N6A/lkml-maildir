I've seen this happen on systems with onboard graphics cards
that share system RAM as video RAM. The end result is that Linux
sees an amount of mem that isn't a power of two.
In extreme cases, the BIOS has done really mad things like
instead of covering the 1GB with 1 MTRR, it splits it into
7 MTRRs covering 512MB,256MB,128MB,64MB,32MB,16MB,8MB.
Icky.
