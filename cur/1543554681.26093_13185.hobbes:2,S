The problem with "flags" is that it no longer contains quite the same
information.  Since the semantics of the field changed slightly,
changing the field name is sometimes more correct.
Also, if a piece of software needs raw CPUID information (unlike the
"cooked" one provided by recent kernels) it should use
/dev/cpu/*/cpuid.
