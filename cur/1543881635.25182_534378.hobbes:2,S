I'm glad you like it, thanks for the review!
Also I've done some code split. It removes all #ifdefs from battery.c,
and also separates core from sysfs and leds.
If there will no objections, I'll send this version when patch window
will opened.
Here it is...

+Linux battery class
+===================
+
+Synopsis
+~~~~~~~~
+Battery class used to export battery properties to userspace in consistent
+manner.
+
+It defines core set of battery attributes, available via sysfs, which
+should be applicable to (almost) every battery out there. Each attribute
+has well defined meaning, up to unit of measure used. While the attributes
+provided are believed to be universally applicable to any battery,
+specific monitoring hardware may not be able to provide them all, so
+any of them may be skipped.
+
+Battery class is extensible, and allows to define drivers own attributes.
+The core attribute set is subject to the standard Linux evolution (i.e.
+if it will be found that some attribute is applicable to many batteries
+or their drivers, it can be added to the core set).
+
+Battery class integrates with External Power framework, for the purpose of
+notification battery drivers when charging power is available. Note that
+specific charge control is left to the battery drivers.
+
+It also integrates with LED framework, for the purpose of providing
+typically expected (at least for portable devices) feedback of battery
+status (charging/fully charged) via LEDs. (Note that specific details of
+the indication (including whether to use it at all) are fully controllable
+by user and/or specific machine defaults, per design principles of LED
+framework).
+
+
+Attributes/properties
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+Battery class has predefined set of attributes, this eliminates code
+duplication across battery drivers. Battery class insist on reusing its
+predefined attributes *and* their units.
+
+So, userspace gets expected set of attributes and their units for
+any kind of battery, and can process/present them to a user in consistent
+manner. Results for different batteries and machines are also directly
+comparable.
+
+See drivers/battery/ds2760_battery.c for the example how to declare and
+handle attributes.
+
+
+Units
+~~~~~
+Quoting include/linux/battery.h:
+
+  All voltages, currents, charges, energies, time and temperatures in uV,
+  uA, uAh, uWh, seconds and tenths of degree Celsius unless otherwise
+  stated. It's driver's job to convert its raw values to units in which
+  this class operates.
+
+
+Attributes/properties detailed
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  Charge/Energy/Capacity - how to not confuse  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
+~                                                                       ~
+~ Because both "charge" (uAh) and "energy" (uWh) represents "capacity"  ~
+~ of battery, battery class distinguish these terms. Don't mix them!    ~
+~                                                                       ~
+~ CHARGE_* attributes represents capacity in uAh only.                  ~
+~ ENERGY_* attributes represents capacity in uWh only.                  ~
+~ CAPACITY attribute represents capacity in *percents*, from 0 to 100.  ~
+~                                                                       ~

+
+Postfixes:
+_AVG - *hardware* averaged value, use it if your hardware is really able to
+report averaged values.
+_NOW - momentary/instantaneous values.
+
+STATUS - this attribute represents operating status (charging, full,
+discharging (i.e. powering a load), etc.). This corresponds to
+BATTERY_STATUS_* values, as defined in battery.h.
+
+HEALTH - represents health of the battery, values corresponds to
+BATTERY_HEALTH_*, defined in battery.h.
+
+VOLTAGE_MAX_DESIGN, VOLTAGE_MIN_DESIGN - design values for maximal and
+minimal battery voltages. Maximal/minimal means values of voltages when
+battery considered "full"/"empty" at normal conditions. Yes, there is
+no direct relation between voltage and battery capacity, but some dumb
+batteries use voltage for very approximated calculation of capacity.
+Battery driver also can use this attribute just to inform userspace
+about maximal and minimal voltage thresholds of a given battery.
+
+CHARGE_FULL_DESIGN, CHARGE_EMPTY_DESIGN - design charge values, when
+battery considered full/empty.
+
+ENERGY_FULL_DESIGN, ENERGY_EMPTY_DESIGN - same as above but for energy.
+
+CHARGE_FULL, CHARGE_EMPTY - These attributes means "last remembered value
+of charge when battery became full/empty". It also could mean "value of
+charge when battery considered full/empty at given conditions (temperature,
+age)". I.e. these attributes represents real thresholds, not design values.
+
+ENERGY_FULL, ENERGY_EMPTY - same as above but for energy.
+
+CAPACITY - capacity in percents.
+
+TEMP - temperature of the battery.
+
+TIME_TO_EMPTY - seconds left for battery to be considered empty (i.e.
+while battery powers a load)
+TIME_TO_FULL - seconds left for battery to be considered full (i.e.
+while battery is charging)
+
+
+QA
+~~
+Q: Where is BATTERY_PROP_XYZ attribute?
+A: If you cannot find attribute suitable for your battery needs, feel free
+   to add it and send patch along with your battery driver.
+
+   The attributes available currently are the ones currently provided by the
+   drivers written.
+
+   Good candidates to add in future: battery technology, model/part#,
+   cycle_time, manufacturer, etc.
+
+
+Q: I have some very specific attribute (e.g. battery color), should I add
+   this attribute to standard ones?
+A: Most likely, no. Such attribute can be placed in the driver itself, if
+   it is useful. Of course, if the attribute in question applicable to
+   large set of batteries, provided by many drivers, and/or comes from
+   some general battery specification/standard, it may be a candidate to
+   be added to the core attribute set.
+
+
+Q: Suppose, my battery monitoring chip/firmware does not provides capacity
+   in percents, but provides charge_{now,full,empty}. Should I calculate
+   percentage capacity manually, inside the driver, and register CAPACITY
+   attribute? The same question about time_to_empty/time_to_full.
+A: Most likely, no. Battery class is designed to export battery properties
+   which are directly measurable by the specific hardware available.
+   Inferring not available properties using some heuristics or mathematical
+   model is not subject of work for a battery driver. Such functionality
+   should be factored out, and in fact, apm_power, the driver to serve
+   legacy APM API on top of battery class, uses a simple heuristic of
+   approximating remaining battery capacity based on its charge, current,
+   voltage and so on. But full-fledged battery model is likely not subject
+   for kernel at all, as it would require floating point calculation to deal
+   with things like differential equations and Kalman filters. This is
+   better be handled by batteryd/libbattery, yet to be written.
