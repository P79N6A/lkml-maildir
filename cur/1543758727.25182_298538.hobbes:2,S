I did not look into the userspace commands supported in BSD
accounting on the dependency on the format of /var/account/pacct
file.
The accounting exit hook allows BSD/CSA to save accounting
data stored in task_struct to internally kept data structure
and then writes to their respective accounting file. The
format of the accounting output file of the two are different,
with CSA being the superset of BSD and also with CSA carrying
concept of grouping of processes.
It would be an interesting project to merge BSD and CSA, but
it is going to take some surgical work on both products, not
an easy one.
