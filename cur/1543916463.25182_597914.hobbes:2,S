The Kconfig for CS89x0 in 2.6.11 is exactly the same as 2.6.22.

I can run CS89x0 for ARM S3C2400 in 2.6.11, at least I can say yes,
the ARM S3C2400A qualifies those in 2.6.11, I don't know the 2.6.22
and I hope someone knows 2.6.22 well can answer it.

Yes, but you only need to enable ISA and NET_PCI to use CS89x0.
