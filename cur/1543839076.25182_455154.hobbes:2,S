I wonder...  I think I forgot to turn SELinux enforcing back on when testing
it.  Now that I do that, I see:
	BUG: Dentry c5294c08{i=0,n=mnt} still in use (1) [unmount of nfs 0:14]
	------------[ cut here ]------------
	kernel BUG at fs/dcache.c:611!
I think Ian's right, I think I've forgotten a dput(), though why you see the
busy inodes message and not the above bug, I'm not sure.
