No - it means that the in-memory size of your image reflects your USE
of memory, rather than the amount you requested.
Overcommit can ELIMINATE one type of memory leak (just calling
malloc() and never using the returned block) - and doesn't really
affect any other use.
If you request, then use, a block of memory, overcommit never really
comes into play.
