Hi.
I'm currently doing some research on the IA32 Segementation Concept. But there's one thing I don't understand:
If I perform a far jump it looks like this:
jmp	16bit:32bit
The 16bit are representing the segement number and the 32bit the offset. But to what refers the 16bit? To the GDT or the current LDT?
