The current status is:
[0]* - compiles fine - works fine
[01]* - couldn't compile
[012]* - compiles fine - crashes
So I believe either 1* or 2* patches are introducing the issue.
In the mean time I had an opportunity to test -aa on a nice IBM NetVista 
computer, whose configuration is as follows:
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corp. 82815 815 Chipset Host Bridge and Memory 
Controller Hub (rev 02)
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corp. 82815 CGC [Chipset Graphics 
Controller] (rev 02)
00:1e.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corp. 82801BA/CA/DB PCI Bridge (rev 02)
00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corp. 82801BA ISA Bridge (LPC) (rev 02)
00:1f.1 IDE interface: Intel Corp. 82801BA IDE U100 (rev 02)
00:1f.2 USB Controller: Intel Corp. 82801BA/BAM USB (Hub #1) (rev 02)
00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corp. 82801BA/BAM SMBus (rev 02)
00:1f.5 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corp. 82801BA/BAM AC'97 Audio (rev 
02)
01:08.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82801BA/BAM/CA/CAM Ethernet 
Controller (rev 01)
I can easily reproduce the same issue on that computer too (of course I am 
using CONFIG_AGP_I810 for agpgart support and CONFIG_DRM_I810 for i810 
display card support).
I think this eliminates the doubt on DRM support of Radeon (or i810 for that 
matter), and the issue appears very specific to agpgart in general.
Anyway I guess we are very close to the problem, if someone helps me to 
compile -aa with [01]* patches I think we can pinpoint the issue I suspect.
Thanks for your help and support.
