Sorry if I'm OT here, but reading the docs on ext3fs I had to upgrade
from e2fsck-1.19 so I got the latest, 1.25 and installed it before
booting 2.4.15pre6.
make check said all was fine. But, when I rebooted some messages sailed
by about not being able to load shared libraries and libgcc_s.so.1 and
fsck said something about errors in the fs and REBOOT NOW. Very scary
always.
I booted up a recovery disk and ran e2fsck-1.10 on both of the relevant
devices and with -f and all was well. I rebooted back to 2.4.14 and got
the same messages flying by. Nothing of the sort in dmesg or the logs.
Can anybody give me a clue as to what is going on? The system goes ahead
and reboots and runs fine with either kernel AFAIK.
gcc-3.0.2

Thanks a bunch, Garst
