Yep, I disagree with that use of the term, because it is misleading and 
caused your confusion.  The context that the ISR executes in is not 
associated with a _known_ process is more correct.

Right, and that becomes more clear when you say that the ISR's is 
executing in an indeterminate process context, rather than saying it 
does not have any context at all, or has its own special context.

No, it has everything to do with the data structures of the process. 
When you are executing "in the same context" as you put it, as called 
from the user mode code, you know you are using the task structure of 
that process and so you can make use of that structure.  For example, 
you can look at the current uid to decide if you should allow an 
operation to proceed.  When you are in an ISR, there _is_ a task 
structure there, but you shouldn't use it because you don't know which 
task structure it is because you don't know which task you are 
interrupting.  Thus if you look at the current uid in an ISR, you have 
no idea what you will see there and it will change from interrupt to 
interrupt, depending on which task gets interrupted.
