I don't know if this is related or not, but I noticed that on old 
redhat-6.2 (glibc-2.1.3) systems, portmap dies instantly under 2.4.21+ 
kernels. Older 2.4.18 kernels worked fine. It exits with -EBADF. I can get 
a complete strace if that's interesting. I tested the portmap binary from 
redhat-7.2 (which works under redhat-7.2) in the 6.2 environment, and it 
had the same problem, so it's not portmap itself.
