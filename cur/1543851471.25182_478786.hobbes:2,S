  This address is from inside the kernel.  On the Itanium arch, kernel starts at
0xa000000100000000
  So you  want the to  see what  function in your  kernel is at  address 0x1a70.
Looking at arch/ia64/kernel/ivt.S, it could either be an "Instruction Key Miss",
which starts  at address  0x1800, but  I'm not sure  that function  reaches your
address. Also, the "page_fault" code is  right below the ikey_miss code, so that
could be  a culprit. To make sure,  please get your kernel  binary (vmlinux) and
disassemble it with objdump. Check in which function the 0x1a70 address lies.
  If  it's a  "Instruction Key  Miss",  your compiler  is _probably_  generating
instructions  incorrectly. If  it's page-faults,  well, data  is  being accessed
differently. 
  Also, Oprofile is a tool that is worth learning how to use:

  good luck,
