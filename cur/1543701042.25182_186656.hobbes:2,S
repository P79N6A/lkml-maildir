I think it was that the PCMCIA core and Yenta modules didn't even get
loaded, I had to modprobe them.  The need to type "cardmgr &" by hand
remained necessary even after recompiling with them built-in and rebooting.

I agree.

"still" as in "even after compiling the drivers as Y instead of M, and
typing the cardmgr command by hand".  Not "still" as in "[not] same as 2.4"
because this bug does not occur in 2.4.

I think both.  "on-hook" happens immediately, and the only way to try again
is to eject the card and reinsert it.

As far as I can tell, in SuSE 8.2 with SuSE's default version of the 2.4.20
kernel, this isn't happening, but in 2.6.0 it is happening even when I
didn't ask for it.  /var/log/messages gets around 20,000 lines of messages
every day that I experiment with 2.6.0, and 90% of it is PCMCIA stuff.  I
think I'm capable of e-mailing it to you if it will help.  Actually later
today I might have time to experiment with the modem and 2.6.0 again, and
might be able to grep for appropriate stuff in /var/log/messages.
