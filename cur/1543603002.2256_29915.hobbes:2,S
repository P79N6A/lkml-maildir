I would be interested to know on which processor your are seeing those
results.
In fact i do not have doubts that on somethuing like an alpha
gcc 3.0.2 is faster.
Maybe it could be faster also on PIV, I do not know. I never tried gcc
3.0.2, i just used gcc 3.0.1 on Athlon systems, but I am
going to gcc 3.0.2 snapshots as soon.
