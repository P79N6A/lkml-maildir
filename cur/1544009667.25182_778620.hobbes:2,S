This is why master is separate from rt-master. The rt-master will grow 
like tip/master does. But the master will be recreated each time. 
Basically, the creation of master is this:
git checkout master
git reset --hard rt-master
./scripts/convert-spinlocks
git commit -a -m 'Convert all spinlocks to lock_t'
./scripts/convert-locks
git commit -a -m 'Convert some locks back to spinlock_t'
Thus we do not need to worry about the conflicts caused by the lock 
conversion. That will be done automatically each time we create a new 
master.
