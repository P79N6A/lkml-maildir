I frequently (daily) get patches which spit new warnings.  Sometimes
(~weekly) those warnings indicate real bugs in the patch.
I believe that the main reason for this is that the developers simply don't
notice the new warning amongst all the noise.

That would be good - but perhaps a better approach would be to send pointed
emails to the maintainer.  Or to merge lameo patches to remove
virt_to_bus() so he has to fix it for real ;)

Problem is, I'm the sucker who takes the brunt of that change.  It'd be
best to fix up the warnings _before_ adding the make-it-break patch.
