This is what I did. Same results, basically.
What I did not do was prove that the xmms stalls went away for those who
were seeing that.

No, its not. And in general, real-time tasks should not do disk I/O (at
least not via their core RT thread). And they should mlock() their
memory.
But circumstances do differ, and these changes are in the right
direction, I think. It also means e.g. someone can make xmms or whatever
real-time, and hopefully avoid the memory-related stalls that spawned
the discussion and this patch.
