Power of two - yes. Greater than 128 no, if newsize were <=128 new2size
would not increment. Previous code may make newsize larger (and later
limit new2size) but not here. And new2size can be equal to newsize, again
by this code.
A comment like /*empty_loop*/ before the semicolon would help human
readability. Code should be readable by humans, too.
