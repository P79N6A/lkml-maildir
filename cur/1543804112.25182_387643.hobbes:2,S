Subject: [PATCH] fcntl F_SETFL and read-only IS_APPEND files
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

hi,
there is code in setfl() which attempts to preserve the O_APPEND flag on 
IS_APPEND files... however IS_APPEND files could also be opened O_RDONLY 
and in that case setfl() should not require O_APPEND...
coreutils 5.93 tail -f attempts to set O_NONBLOCK even on regular files... 
unfortunately if you try this on an append-only log file the result is 
this:
fcntl64(3, F_GETFL)                     = 0x8000 (flags O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE)
fcntl64(3, F_SETFL, O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_LARGEFILE) = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)
i offer up the patch below as one way of fixing the problem... i've tested 
it fixes the problem with tail -f but haven't really tested beyond that.
(i also reported the coreutils bug upstream... it shouldn't fail imho...
