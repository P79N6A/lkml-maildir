You have just excluded a certain number of clustering stacks from
working. Or at least required them to maintain translation tables. A
UUID has many nice properties; one of the most important ones being that
it is inherently unique (and thus doesn't require an adminstrator to
assign a node id), and that it also happens to be big enough to hold
anything else you might want to, like the primary IPv6 address of a
node.
We've had that discussion on the OCF list, and I think that was one of
the few really good ones.

You've missed the point of my question. I did not mean "How does an
application use the cluster comm links", but "How is the kernel
component told which paths/IPs it should use".

Again, you've told me how user-space learns about the events. This
wasn't the question; I was asking how user-space tells the kernel about
the membership.

Not what I asked; see the discussion with David.

So you'd expect a user-level suid daemon of sorts to wrap around this.
Fair enough.

Which is what the above questions were about ;-) heartbeat uses UUIDs
for node identification; we've got a pretty strict security model, and
we do not necessarily use IP as the transport mechanism, and our
membership runs in user-space.
The automagic aspects are the icing on the cake ;-)

... which is why I asked the above questions: User-space needs to
interface with the kernel to tell it the membership (if the membership
is user-space driven), or retrieve it (if it is kernel driven).
This implies we need to understand the expected semantics of the kernel,
and either standarize them, or have a way for user-space to figure out
which are wanted when interfacing with a particular kernel.
