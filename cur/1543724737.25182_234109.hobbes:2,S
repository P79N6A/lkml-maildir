You get "BadCRC" errors.  They usually indicate bad cabling.

Are you sure it is _exactly_ the same error?
If it is "task_no_data_intr" one then it is harmless
(means that command is not supported by a drive).

RedHat has its own bugtracking system for their kernels.
Please check if you can reproduce the problem with the current

AFAICS the current kernel for RH9 is kernel-2.4.20-31.9 and you should
be using it instead of > 1 year old 2.4.20-8 version.
