Howdy,
I've updated my big watchdog patch to 2.4.20-pre1.  New changes include:
adding error handling to initialization,
fixing pci_enable_device calls,
adding in the C99 struct initializers,
remove the entry in MAINTAINERS for the pcwd driver.
I've stopped tracking the 2.4-ac tree because I'm planning to start adding in
Configure.help, Config.in, and Makefile changes, as well as hopefully starting
to track 2.5 (or 2.5-dj, one or the other).
Patch is up at

Regards,
