This one is fatal:
| ACPI: Found ECDT
| ACPI: Could not use ECDT
And you also have
| ACPI: Processor [CPU0] (supports 4 throttling states)
| ACPI: Processor [CPU1] (supports 4 throttling states)
(IOW, no C2/C3 states listed here)
The buggy ECDT table (see 
http://www.poupinou.org/acpi/ibm_ecdt.html
)
is said to cause ACPI init to fail:
http://t2100cdt.kippona.net/tlinux/archive/linux.toshiba-dme.co.jp/ML/tlinux-users/4300/4396.html
as such it's not too astonishing that you don't have C2/C3 states, *always*
(pre-suspend and post-suspend).
However the machine should still do normal HLT idle loop which should
manage to keep it reasonably cool, right?
Given this ECDT table issue it's very possible that this is the reason for
Linux ACPI layer misbehaviour after resume.
Google "ACPI ECDT" might help, too.
In any case, you could do some kernel logging around pm_idle* in
drivers/acpi/processor_idle.c since I suspect that this is what changes
after resume to cause the idling to fail.
