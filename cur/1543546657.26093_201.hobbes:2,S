Well, you are probably right but as long as the process actually does
die eventually, I think it works. That's why a lib_pthreads control 
user space daemon seems plausible.

I hate the idea of adding in-kernel synchronization/locks to deal with
a really stupid design  -- POSIX signals/threads are best at arms
length.
And I like the idea of pushing the complexities of shared signal stuff
to processes that insist on using them. Pthread_kill makes sense,and
kill(threaded_process,... ) makes sense if the signal handlers are
global to the threaded process. That's why I like the idea of the root
thread getting signals and having the option of sending them off to 
other threads.  Once you have that, it's more tempting to think of things
like this SIGOVERKILL -- but maybe Alsmberger's name is a tipoff.
