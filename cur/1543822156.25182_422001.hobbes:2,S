I realise this is at the wrong end of your queue, but if you _can_ easily
break it out and submit it first, it would be a nice cleanup and would help
shrink your main patchset.
Also, we're recently having some problems with architectures not aligning
zones correctly. Would it make sense to add these sorts of sanity checks,
and possibly forcing alignment corrections into your generic code?
