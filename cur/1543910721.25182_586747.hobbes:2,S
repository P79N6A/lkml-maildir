Yes, that is due to the unbounded nature of direct reclaim, no?
I've been meaning to write some patches to address this problem in a way
that does not introduce the hard wall Linus objects to. If only I had
this extra day in the week :-/
And then there is the deadlock in add_to_swap() that I still have to
look into, I hope it can eventually be solved using reserve based
allocation.

The main problem with networked swap is not so much sending out the
pages (this has similar problems like the filesystems but is all bounded
in its memory use).
The biggest issue is receiving the completion notification. Network
needs to fall back to a state where it does not blindly consumes memory
or drops _all_ packets. An intermediate state is required, one where we
can receive and inspect incoming packets but commit to very few.
In order to create such a network state and for it to be stable, a
certain amount of memory needs to be available and an external trigger
is needed to enter and leave this state - currently provided by there
being more memory available than needed or not.
