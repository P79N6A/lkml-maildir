we're talking:
  shrink_page_list()
    TestSetPageLock()
    try_to_unmap()
      try_to_unmap_file()
        try_to_unmap_one()
          set_page_dirty()
Which, because its run under the page lock, should always be false,
right? perhaps a WARN_ON might do.

exit_mmap(), do_unmap()
  unmap_vmas()
    unmap_page_range()
      zap_{pud,pmd,pte}_range()
vmtruncate()
  unmap_mapping_range()
    unmap_mapping_range_*()
      unmap_mapping_range_vma(), madvise_dontneed()
        zap_page_range()
          unmap_vmas()
            unmap_page_range()
              zap_{pud,pmd,pte}_range()
Which is all ran without the page lock, so might be open for a race;
however, I don't see that hurting because the whole page is un-accounted
pretty soon afterwards.

Nope
