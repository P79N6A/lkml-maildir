I recently picked up a new server of really new hardware, and I've run
into a number of issues with the latest git HEAD kernels. I'll make
separate posts for each of the issues.
CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo E6400
Motherboard: Intel DG965RY
BIOS revisions: July/07/2006 AND September/06/2006 (tried both)
The most significant of them - is that somewhere between 2.6.17.11 and
2.6.18-rc6-git4, MMCONFIG is now being used, but leads to a complete
hardware hang (SYSRQ does not respond).
As of the current HEAD, I need to boot with pci=nommconf OR acpi=off,
otherwise the machine completely freezes a short while into the PCI
detection routine. Using acpi=off disables SMP, which is not desirable
on this box, but otherwise does work.
All of the following boot params lead to a failure:
pci=assign-busses
acpi=strict
pci=noacpi
acpi=ht
pci=nomsi
At the following URL, I have photos and transcriptions of the kernel
boots, as well as dmesg output from working 2.6.17.11 and .18-rc7-git1
with pci=nommconf.
