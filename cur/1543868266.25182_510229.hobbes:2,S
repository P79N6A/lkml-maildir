Good. So try_to_freeze_tasks() can forget about "if (!p->vfork_done)" check.
This needs more thinking, of course. For example, thaw_process() should be
carefull to clear TIF_FREEZE if we have the new flag set, but not PF_FROZEN.
frozen() should be changed to return true if PF_NEW_FLAG && TIF_FREEZE, but
it also called by refrigerator.
But IF we really can do this, it will be a general solution.

I can't judge. Changed the subject to have more attention from experts.

I'd suggest not to put "VFORK" into the name. Probably we will find other
usage for this flag which in fact means: "I am sleeping TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
at the safe place to freeze, I promise to do try_to_freeze() when I have
CPU".
And now another problem: exec. de_thread() sleeps in TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
waiting for all sub-threads to die, and we have the same "deadlock" if
one of them is frozen. This is nasty. Probably we can change the ->state
to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE and add try_to_freeze(), or play with the new PF_
flag, but I am not sure it is safe to freeze() the task which is deep
in the exec() path.
