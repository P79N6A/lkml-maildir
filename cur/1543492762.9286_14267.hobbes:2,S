I'm not quite sure if bridging works with ipchains. If you want to
establish transparent application proxies instead of packet filtering
alone then there is no way to design the box as a routing firewall, not a
bridging firewall.
In that case the firewall has to be the default router for your lab
LAN. If your lab is large (> 20 PCs) then it would be a good decision to
establish DCHP for the lab (look at ISCs web site) at the time you change 
the route. Furthermore the firewall has to get the static routes and the
router(s) of the uni campus has/have to get a new route to your lab.
The other way to work with (even I haven't done that) is to route
the traffic from eth0 to tap0 and from eth1 to tap1 and to deal with 
ethertap devices. Then you can establish a stateful inspection of packets.
But be warned - that's very hard work and academic merites to get.
If you succeed with a bridging firewall, please let me know.
That's a very interesting special case.
I know that NAI (former McAfee) had/has(?) a solution named WebShield,
based on a Linux 2.0.33 kernel with bridging interfaces. But they didn't
do packet filtering, they filtered HTTP, FTP and SMTP. At CeBIT'99 I heard
from a NAI rep. that this project had been cancelled.
