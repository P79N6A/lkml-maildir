NAK this for now
For the standard SATA controllers it is probably true now and will
definitely be true by December 2007 but there is lots of stuff out there
which uses SATA/PATA bridges on older PATA controllers such as the
VIA and HPT controllers. While support for them varies between rock solid
(VIA) and passable (HPT), I don't think its yet time to bump those people
towards libata forcibly at all.
About the only thing this would meaningfully obsolete would be
ide/pci/siimage.c for SI3112 and some PCI identifiers from ide/pci/piix.c.
