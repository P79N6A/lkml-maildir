The +S bit only applies to directory updates.  If a directory has the +S
bit set then name updates in that directory are all synchronous.  The
flag is inherited by subdirs.  The fact that regular files inherit it
too doesn't matter: you still need to open(O_SYNC) explicitly to get
synchronous metadata updates for regular files.
