In theory it's useful; in reality at you'll have to balance what's 
public and what's not, and it's easy to allow yourself to get bogged 
down into "digesting", so much so that the "doing" is put off.
My only request is that you (a) make the graphics interface as simple 
and high level as feasible and (b) you publish the hardware interface 
specification as soon as possible, so that driver work can occur in 
parallel.

Once you have a core design, it's easier to dicker about specific 
features.  I would put this stuff on the "worry about it later" list.

Will users need to purchase additional "update FPGA" hardware to do the 
reprogramming?

Well, I certainly like it :)
I think that a more generic approach allows you to recognize performance 
bottlenecks, and update the IP core to support instructions specific to 
(say) triangles.
Random closing notes:
* data movement will be an everpresent issue
* in graphics you really have a number of data types (16-bit float, 
etc.) that are specific to graphics.  Supporting these natively should 
be quite helpful, if not an already-obvious prerequisite
