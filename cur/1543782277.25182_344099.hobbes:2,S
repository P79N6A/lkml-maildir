... breaks ppc64 since there we have node_to_cpumask() done as inlined
function, not a macro.  So we get __first_cpu(&node_to_cpumask(...),...),
with obvious consequences.
Locally I'm turning node_to_cpumask() into define, just to see what else
had changed in the build, but we probably want saner solution for that
one...
