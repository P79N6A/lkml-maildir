Hi all, 
I was wondering if anybody has had success running a 2.2.x kernel on a
samurai-based motherboard?  Specifically, I've seen lockups on a Dual
PII/300MHz motherboard here in our lab.  The lockups are repeatable but
silent -- nothing in the logs indicates what the problem is.  Does
anybody have any clues as to how I can narrow down what the problem or
problems may be?
Thanks in advance,
Rick
