True, and if securing sensitive data against pageout were the only reason
for SHM_LOCK, then I guess it might be an argument for letting anyone with
read permission do SHM_UNLOCK.
But that's not the only reason for SHM_LOCK, and all you're telling us
there is that the owner of sensitive data should be careful who they
give read permission to - indeed!  So I still tend to agree with
Michael, that the most natural restriction is to owner or creator -
relax that if some app actually has a good case for relaxing it.
