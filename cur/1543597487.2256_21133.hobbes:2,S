Well, actually the sole purpose of <has_cpu> is
to lock a task out of a scheduling decision. Remember
during transient states, there are two tasks that have
the <has_cpu> flag set for a particular cpu.
So I think using <has_cpu> is kosher and preferred in
this situation, IMHO.
As you saw from David Levines reply, he thinks that
a list is more appropriate for more generic decision
support.
But I don't like the fact that you lock down several
tasks at that point. In my solution, you return the
task back to general schedulability.

I like it.  Especially the way you eliminated the situation where
we would have multiple tasks waiting for schedule.  Hope this is
not a frequent situation!!!  The only thing I don't like is the
use of has_cpu to prevent the task from being scheduled.  Right
now, I can't think of any problems with it.  However, in the past
I have been bit by using fields for purposes other than what they
were designed for.
