Hm, after calling kobject_init_ng() is also the earliest point that you
can rely on kobject_put() really cleaning stuff up. Both kobject_put()
and kfree() are fine then, but I think kobject_put() makes for cleaner
code.

kobject_del() should only undo what kobject_add() did. So kobject_put()
will still be needed to clean up the memory. Perhaps the wording should
be:
If the function is successful, the only way to properly clean up the
kobject is to call kobject_del() for removing the kobject from the
hierarchy and to subsequently call kobject_put() to clean up the memory.

Probably not. Callers of kobject_add() always had to create the uevent
themselves; it was only with kobject_register() they could rely on the
uevent being created.

Agreed. And how about "cannot" or "could not" instead of "can not"?

This sentence makes only sense if kobject_destroy() is something like
kobject_unregister_ng().

I think it should be made explicit which actions are OK after failure
or success of this function since that is what people easily get wrong.

Agreed.

This would be surprising: I wouldn't expect a kobject to be cleaned up
just because I removed it from the hierarchy.

This looks saner.
