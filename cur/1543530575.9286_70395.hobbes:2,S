Last updated in Oct '99 or September '99 is not what I call frequent
updates.

If there are bugs in the current 2.2.x kernel series, file a bug
report.  (see REPORTING-BUGS in the kernel source tree)  I am sure there
are things that need to be migrated over from Donald's drivers.
As has been pointed out many times, change management in the stable
series is incredibly important.  You simply cannot blanketly update a
popular driver like tulip, you must incrementally update it, so that
changes can be evaluated carefully.  Donald is not perfect, and his
newer drivers do not work at all for some people.

Sure discussion occurs.  I don't see frequent updates appearing on
Donald's web site, nor do I see discussion of Donald's net driver core
changes on any mailing list [except when I flame him of course].

The compatibility layer exists only for older kernels, which would
obviously need the support in order to run 2.3 drivers.  the compat
layer would be a no-op on the current kernel.

You miss my point.
If changes are not regularly pushed out to the Linus tree, then you miss
important bug reports.  The people on linux-tulip, and the people who
use the driver's on Donald's web site, are SELF-SELECTED, and represent
the minority of all Tulip users.  This is not adequate enough testing to
ensure that a massive update will be bug-free for the users at large.
Donald lets changes build and build into one massive update, a "take it
or leave it" update.  If Alan accepts the update, then you take the good
with the bad.  Donald's massive updates have been BUGGY for some, great
for others.  Since his updates are KNOWN TO BE BUGGY for some cases, the
choice has been to not update the kernel driver, or update it piecemeal
with feedback from individual hackers and testers.
