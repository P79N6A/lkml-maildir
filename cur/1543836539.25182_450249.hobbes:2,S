Well in that case, could you list the size of it for all Linux archs
please? We know that today long is the only one that differs and that
m68k has horrible natural alignment rules for historical reasons, but
besides that it's pretty sane.
Just because something exists doesn't mean using it is a good thing.
Just like gcc supporting exceptions :)
