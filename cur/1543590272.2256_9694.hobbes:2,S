In the mean time I down/upgraded to 2.2.17 on my PPC box (CHRP LongTrail,
Sym53c875, HP C5136A  DDS1) and I can confirm that the problem does not happen
under 2.2.17 neither.
My experiences:
  - reading works fine, writing doesn't
  - 2.2.x works fine, 2.4.x doesn't (at least since 2.4.0-test1-ac10)
  - hardware compression doesn't matter
  - I have a sym53c875, Lorenzo has an Adaptec, so most likely it's not a
    SCSI hardware driver bug
  - I have a PPC, Lorenzo doesn't, so it's not CPU-specific
  - corruption is always a block of 32 bytes being replaced by 32 bytes from
    the previous tape block (depending on block size!) (approx. 6 errors per
    256 MB)
Lorenzo, can you please investigate the exact nature of the corruption on your
system?
  - How many successive bytes are corrupted?
  - Where do the corrupted data come from?

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
