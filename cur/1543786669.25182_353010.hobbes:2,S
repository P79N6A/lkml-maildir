I don't have a good (or in fact any) understanding of the impact
of GFP_DMA32 on ia64.  People tell me it will all be good, but I'd
like to hear from someone running it.
If it is good, and if it is coming soon, then there is no point
moving swiotlb.  But I don't know the answers to either of those
questions.
