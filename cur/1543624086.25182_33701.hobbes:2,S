Hi,
I am trying to compile kernel version 2.4.16 for powerpc with networking off
i.e.
CONFIG_NET was not set.
-----------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------
I am wondering why is it compiling in the net/core directory when I do not want
any
kind of networking support!
After looking at the Makefiles I found that it compiles the net, net/core and
net/ethernet
directories even if  CONFIG_NET is not set. I tried to remove all the networking
 stuff by
changing the makefiles but I had to fix the following:
1. removed (using #ifdef) all the socket related stuff except for a
sys_socketcall which
returns ENOTSUPP. This hook is needed by the code in arch dir
2. put the sock_init call in main.c inside #ifdef
3. added some #ifdefs in fs/fcntl.c to remove calls to  sock_fcntl
Am I doing it right or will it break something? Do we need socket.c etc. even
when we
do not want networking support?
Thanks,
Harendra
