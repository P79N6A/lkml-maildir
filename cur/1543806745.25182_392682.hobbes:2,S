inadequateness on Linux did force libscg to go this way.
The current method used by libscg is well established since 10 years.
Now Linux likes to confuse people by trying to enforce a completely 
incompatible access method.
Note that I need to avoid unneeded efforts and for this reason, I need to wait
5 years until is is forseable that a recent incompatible change in Linux will
survive long enough to spent time on it.
