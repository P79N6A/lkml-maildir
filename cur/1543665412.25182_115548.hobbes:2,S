No, and no.  Try these patches (apply in this order, may need
some hand-patching to apply to the current 2.4.21-pre source):
http://www.amelek.gda.pl/linux-patches/2.4.20-pre9/00_parport_serial
http://www.amelek.gda.pl/linux-patches/2.4.20-pre9/01_netmos
Please test - I'd like to know if it works for you.  It should -
I have 3 such cards in 2 servers, running patched 2.4.20 kernel
in production use for 3 months now (mainly serial ports used, but
2S1P cards were cheaper than 2S cards...).  Attempts to submit
the changes have been ignored, so I gave up...
NetMos support was already in early 2.4.x kernels, later removed:
	* parport_serial.c: Remove NetMos support, since it causes problems
	for some people.
No idea what exactly these problems are, who "some people" are, why
NetMos support was not simply made a config option conditional on
CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL, and why the link order bugfix (separate patch,
which only fixes an obvious bug) has been ignored too.
Perhaps you will have more luck than I did - test your card with the
patches for some time, if it works try to submit the patches again...

I don't use devfs, so I never had this problem.
Hope this helps,
Marek
