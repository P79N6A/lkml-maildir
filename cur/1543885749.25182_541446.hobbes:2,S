My patch (that started the discussion you mentioned and seems to have 
been applied unchanged) contained both the wanted PCI_MULTITHREAD_PROBE 
removal and a removal of some of your new infrastructure.
Let's revert it, and I'll then send a new patch containing only the 
PCI_MULTITHREAD_PROBE removal.

You meant to say:
  depends on EXPERIMENTAL && !ATA && !IDE && !...
Multithreaded probing on the PCI bus currently breaks too much kernel 
code.
And we've already seen how many systems it therefore breaks in practice.
