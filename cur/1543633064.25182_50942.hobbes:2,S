In theory.  But the right solution is to move userspace as soon as
possible, for spinning up non-root disks, etc.
More importantly we can use the same mechanism to say "do this after
all cpus are up" or "do this once we have a userspace" etc, and move
more things to initcalls (ie. neaten the boot code).
