	Not sure if automount is really less flexible. I prefer it over
	amd because it is much more efficient (compile time over NFS
	is up to 20% faster using automount instead of amd).
	My biggest worry is with NFS itself, which sometimes gets
	stuck during mounting, with no other possibility than a
	reboot. Usually happens when the NFS server reboots. Sometimes
	for some other reasons (like this morning at work...).
	Out of curiosity, are really the other NFS implementations
	better than the one of Linux (Solaris, FreeBSD, for example).
	When I read the discussions related to NFS in l-k, I just
	wonder : "Are these problems specific to Linux NFS ?
	How are they solved under FreeBSD (for example) ? Have had the
	people working on NFS (Trond, Olaf, HJL, etc.) a look at *BSD
	source code ?"
	NFS is the 'nerf de la guerre' for us, and I'd really see the
	Linux servers/clients as the most reliable ones.
