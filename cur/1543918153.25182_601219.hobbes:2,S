Hi Zach!
Thanks for the responses.

This looks more like a completion. Actually, completions don't have PI
either, but they are usually OK.

Actually, it may still be a high priority. We have one BUG currently that
seems to trigger starvation. But we don't know yet if it's a bug in the
test or in the FS code yet.  I don't know the full details yet, but we do
have someone currently looking at it. These tests are what found this
issue in the first place.
When more info becomes available, I will definitely CC the linux-fsdevel
list. Thanks for letting me know about it. (I usually get confused by all
the different lists that are out there).
