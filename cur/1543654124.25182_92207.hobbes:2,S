Crap. I saw your email from three weeks ago, and I think I even started 
replying to it. But, it must have got lost.. I'm really sorry about that.

I overlooked this part of your code, and will fix it. IMO, the proper
thing to do is Option #2 - only put those attributes we know exist in the
default_attrs[] array - and add the conditional attributes later. Though 
it does duplicate code, I'd rather favor the common case where default 
attributes really are default attributes, and don't need an existence 
test.
