Yep. One thing Irix always seemed to be rather neat about was page size
dependant on ram size of box.

PC's have the AGP GART. That provides an MMU for the graphics card in effect.

I don't know of any capture cards that don't do scatter gather. Most of them
do scatter gather with skipping and byte alignment so you can DMA around
other windows.
This is the main point. There are so so few devices that actually _have_ to
have lots of linear memory it is questionable that it is worth paying the
price to allow modules to allocate that way
