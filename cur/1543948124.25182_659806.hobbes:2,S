"Ignore" seems a bit strong; those events may be wakeup triggers,
which would cause the hardware to make it a very short suspend state.
"Defer handling" is more to the point, be it by hardware or software.

Not on most busses I work with; the hardware issues notifications
whenever the devices are removable.
Which is a Good Thing ... scanning, as you suggest, is inherently
not reliable.  If a mouse is swapped, it likely doesn't matter a
lot whether it's the "same" or not.
But ... how about if some removable storage media was taken out,
updated on a different system, then restored before the resume?
Not many filesystems handle that sanely.  You *really* want to
have hardware which reports disconnect/reconnect events, or which
physically prevents them (locked case etc).
