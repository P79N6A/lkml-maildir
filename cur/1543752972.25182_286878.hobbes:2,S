I've been unable to apply your patch cleanly on top of 2.6.11-rc1-mm1, but 
eventually I've managed to apply it manually.
I can confirm it works as expected.
Without parameters I get in dmesg:
  it87: Found IT8705F chip at 0x290, revision 2
  it87 0-0290: Detected broken BIOS defaults, disabling PWM interface
No pwm appears in sysfs and the missing linefeed has been fixed
Adding "options it87 fix_pwm_polarity=1" in modules.conf I get:
  it87: Found IT8705F chip at 0x290, revision 2
  it87 0-0290: Reconfiguring PWM to active high polarity
PWM controllers appear in sysfs, the fan doesn't stop running at load time and 
pwm values are now in normal direction: (0 stops, 255 runs full-speed).
Thanks!
