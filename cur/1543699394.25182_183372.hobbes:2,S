I thought highmem wasn't necesarily needed for memory <=2GB? Highmem 
incurs some performance hits doesn't it and so the urge to move to it 
with only 2GB is not very attractive.  Anyways i'm just interested in if 
that's the case or not since 2GB is easy to get to these days and i had 
heard that highmem could be avoided passed the 1GB barrier.
