I know, I know :)
It became such an elaborate discussion here that I really didn't want the 
entire patchset, which adds a lot of power for cpuset-constrained 
applications using mempolicies, to stall on it.
I'm not opposed to adding comments in certain places or changing the name 
of an automatic variable, but that's been the degree of review that these 
patches have had.

Notice in patch 2 of the series where I add the flags member to struct 
mempolicy:
	+	unsigned short flags;	/* See set_mempolicy() MPOL_F_* above */
I had to explicitly say they were for "set_mempolicy() MPOL_F_*" flags in 
an attempt to separate them from the various get_mempolicy() MPOL_F_* 
flags that already exist.  Instead of simply choosing a different format, 
I felt that MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES, for example, is exactly what userspace 
should use and corresponds well with the existing get_mempolicy() flags.
