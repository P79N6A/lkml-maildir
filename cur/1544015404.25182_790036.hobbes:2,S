Too bad :(
For when is the next merge window scheduled (approximatively...)?
What impact does this have on procedure for supplying updates to it?
Indeed, I've got a couple of new features in the pipeline that I'd like
to add in the new future:
 - centralizing the switch of kernel compression in a common place (will
make it easier to add new compressions once all architectures support
the new scheme, without the need of touching all of them).
 - support for new LZMA variant with "real" magic numbers
 - support for "no kernel compression" option (people have asked me for
this for the case where they have a boot loader that already handles
decompression)

What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of those? Personally,
I'd prefer a choice that:
 - allows the most lightweight procedure for updating it (i.e. allows to
supply incremental changes, rather than do a "full" release)
 - is most visible (so that when people ask me for it, I can for example
tell them "it's already in the -mm tree, download it from xxx". Oh, and
visibility will give it also more test exposure)

Well ease of merging the ARM code in is obviously also a consideration
to take into account.
