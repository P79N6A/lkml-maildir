Sorry Jaroslav byt this not unix way.
Wny applications myst know anything about hardware layer ?
In unix way all this details are rolled on kernel layer.

If we have so many "portable" sound API libraries .. look most of them 
uses the same way for handle sound on kernel interaction. Is this 
complicated ALSA way is realy neccessary ?
For example .. jackd can use OSS API for handle sound device.

Allow me translate sentence from my signature to english
"People do not have problems they create them themselves"
and ALSA case matches in 100%.
