I'm not sure what you mean here. I think you will find that this
particular capability was supported in libcap 2.03. Current is 2.09.
Also, having Ack'd your proposed kernel patch, I speculatively included
support for it in libcap-2.08. I will, of course, remove this support if
the kernel doesn't adopt your change - or picks a different strategy...
As it is, the patched kernel works nicely. :-)
