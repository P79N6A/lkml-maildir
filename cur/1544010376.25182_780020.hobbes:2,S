Unfortunately, ftrace at the moment can't fully replace 
TRACE_ENTRY()/TRACE_EXIT() statements, because it lacks:
1. Doing trace in only some modules or source files. Noise from tracing 
of the whole kernel is not needed if we investigate problem in only one 
module (SCST in this case).
2. Ability to inject own messages in the output stream. It's needed to 
have synchronized stream of output messages about both functions tracing 
and what those functions doing. For instance:
entry in func1()
adding cmd C to list L
exit from func1()
Otherwise there would be 2 traces:
entry in func1()
exit from func1()
and
adding cmd C to list L
which almost impossible to merge to analyze.

OK, we will move descriptions of functions from prototypes to definitions.

Those headers are not stripped down. Better analogy is with C++ private 
and public class interfaces. Public SCST headers have public symbols for 
external modules (target drivers mainly), but private headers are for 
internal SCST use only. They are needed to better draw a boundary 
between public and internal private interfaces.
