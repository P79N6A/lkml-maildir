I'm not sure ext2meta will be sufficient.  It's not just a matter of
modifying the on-disk metadata, as would be needed for defrag, but I
would also need to modify some of the in-core data structions in the
ext2/3 filesystem data structures.  For example, when you resize the
filesystem, you need to increase the number of group descriptors,
which means you need to kmalloc, copy, and then kfree sbi->group_desc
out from under the mounted filesystem.
No doubt ext2meta could be modified so it could "reach out and touch"
internal ext2/3 fileststem data structures in core.  But the locking
issues involved get really messy.
My original plan was to adapt Andreas Dilger's on-line resizing patch
to use the new block group layout, which would obviate the need to
take the filesystem off-line and run ext2prepare first.  I'm not
opposed to trying to do it via ext2meta, but it seems like it might
get complicated and hairy quite quickly.
