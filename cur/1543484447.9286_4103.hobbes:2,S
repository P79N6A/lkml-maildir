If its anything like nscd on Solaris, it basically is a Naming Service Caching
Daemon.  It carries out and caches /etc/passwd, /etc/group file lookups.  The
one with Solaris is multi-threaded and can cache DNS lookups as well (if
enabled).  The Solaris version uses the DOORS interface to answer lookup
requests.  It can cache negative lookups as well.  But, I'm not sure how much
common functionality, if any, the glibc 2.1 nscd has with the Solaris one.
