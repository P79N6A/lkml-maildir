Good.  My earlier stubbornness was caused by a desire to allow static
initializers, but now I see that specifying the values in the
registration call really isn't all that bad.

So far this work has all been based on the vanilla kernel.  Should I 
switch over to basing it on -mm?

What happens when there are two ptrace exceptions at different points
during the same system call?  Won't we end up sending the signal twice
no matter what?

In theory we should get an exception with both DR_STEP and DR_TRAPn 
set, meaning that neither notifier will return NOTIFY_STOP.  But if the 
kprobes handler clears DR_STEP in the DR6 image passed to the 
hw_breakpoint handler, it should work out better.

That sounds not quite right.  To a user-space debugger, a system call
should appear as an atomic operation.  If multiple ptrace exceptions
occur during a system call, all the relevant DR_TRAPn bits should be
set in vdr6 together and all the other ones reset.  How can we arrange
that?
There's also the question of whether to send the SIGTRAP.  If
extraneous bits are set in DR6 (e.g., because the CPU always sets some
extra bits) then we will never get NOTIFY_STOP.  Nevertheless, the
signal should not always be sent.

I disagree.  kfree() is documented to return harmlessly when passed a
NULL pointer, and lots of places in the kernel have been changed to
remove useless tests for NULL before calls to kfree().  This is just
another example.

I figured there was some reason like that.
