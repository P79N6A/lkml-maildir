Subject: [PATCH] faster signal handling on x86
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

I noticed an unneeded write to dr7 in the signal handling path for x86.  
We only need to write to dr7 if there is a breakpoint to re-enable, and 
MOVDR is a serializing instruction, which is expensive.  Getting rid of 
it gets a 33% faster signal delivery path (at least on Xeon - I didn't 
test other CPUs, so your gain may vary).
Cheers,

Optimize away the unconditional write to debug registers on signal delivery
path.  This is already done on x86_64.  Measured delta TSC for three paths
on a 2.4GHz Xeon.
1) With unconditional write to dr7 :  800-1000 cycles
2) With conditional write to dr7   :  84-112 cycles
3) With unlikely write to dr7      :  84 cycles
Performance test using divzero microbenchmark (3 million divide by zeros):
With unconditional write: 
   7.445 real / 6.136 system
   7.529 real / 6.482 system
   7.541 real / 5.974 system
   7.546 real / 6.217 system
   7.445 real / 6.167 system
With unlikely write:
   5.779 real / 4.518 system
   5.783 real / 4.591 system
   5.552 real / 4.569 system
   5.790 real / 4.528 system
   5.554 real / 4.382 system
That's about a 33% speedup - more than I expected; apparently getting rid
of the serializing instruction makes the do_signal path much faster.
