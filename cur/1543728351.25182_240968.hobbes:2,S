This would be ideal for those working on the projects using that stack.  If 
others agree I'll put together patches that introduce the ieee80211* module into 
wireless-2.6 once I get the next driver snapshots out for ipw2100 and ipw2200.

The driver supports (and defaults to) using firmware_class for loading the 
firmware.  The driver also supports a legacy loading approach for folks that 
have problems with using hotplug to load the firmware (which represents a fair 
number of users).

The firmware license supports redistribution, and complying with the license 
shouldn't be too hard (I agree it may not be worded the most clearly, but few 
legal documents are).  If you have issues or questions about specific terms 
please email me offlist and I can try and address them.
Just to re-answer some others may be wondering regarding the firmware:
1) the firmware does not use nor is it dependent (at all) on the kernel.  no 
part of the firmware executes on the host CPU.
2) the firmware is loaded from disk vs. having to have non-volatile storage on 
the NIC and requiring a firmware flashing utility, etc.
3) the firmware, as per its license, can be redistributed by OSDs, ISVs, etc.
Thanks,
James
