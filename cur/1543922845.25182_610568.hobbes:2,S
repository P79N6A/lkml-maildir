As Dan said, we've been discussing this offline, and hadn't come to an
agreement yet.  My version of the patch is the opposite of yours -
instead of adding a kref_get(), I remove one of the kref_put() calls.

When a channel is removed from dmaengine, too many kref_put() calls
are made and the device removal happens too soon, usually causing
a panic.
