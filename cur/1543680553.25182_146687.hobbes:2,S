Everything up to and including 2.4.22-pre2 is working without problems.
Under 2.4.22-pre3 I can reiserfsck the partition and see i/o going on for
minutes without troubles.
But I cannot mount it, the box completely hangs about 1 second after mount try.
I see the drive leds blinking shortly and that's it.

Stephan
