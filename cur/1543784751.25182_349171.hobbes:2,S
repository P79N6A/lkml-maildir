if 2.6.13 removed the devfs config option, then I would say the code 
itself should stay until 2.6.15 or 2.6.16 (if the release schedule does 
drop down to ~2 months then it would need to be at lease .16). especially 
with so many people afraid of the 2.6 series you need to wait at least one 
full release cycle, probably two (and possibly more if they end up being 
short ones) then rip out the rest of the code for the following release.
remember that the distros don't package every kernel, they skip several 
between releases and it's not going to be until they go to try them that 
all the kinks will get worked out.
add to this the fact that many people have gotten confused about kernel 
releases and think that since 13 is odd 2.6.13 is a testing kernel and 
2.6.14 will be a stable one and so won't look at .13
note that all this assumes that the issues that people have about sysfs 
not yet being able to replace that capabilities that they are useing in 
devfs have been addressed.
