I don't think it's phy_change().  It's something else that may be  
scheduled.

Right now, that's probably about right.

Ok, I think this is the summary:
- phy_change() is the work queue callback function (scheduled when a  
PHY interrupt occurs)
- dev_close() invokes the controller's stop/close/whatever function,  
and it calls phy_disconnect()
- phy_disconnect() calls phy_stop_interrupts().  To prevent any  
pending phy_change() calls from getting confused, phy_stop_interrupts 
() needs to flush the queue.  Otherwise, subsequent memory freeings  
will leave phy_change() hanging.
- If phy_stop_interrupts() calls flush_scheduled_work(), keventd will  
execute its queues while rtnl_lock is held, providing opportunity for  
other callbacks to deadlock.
- innocent puppies are slaughtered, and the world mourns.
Maciej's solution is to schedule phy_disconnect() to be called from a  
work queue.  That solution should work, but it sounds like it doesn't  
require the check for if keventd is running.
Of course, my objection to it is that it now requires the ethernet  
controller to be excessively aware of the details of how the PHY Lib  
is handling the PHY interrupts (by scheduling them on a work queue).
