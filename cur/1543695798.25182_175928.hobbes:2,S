Like so many of these things, bonnie++ is generally far, far too complex
for kernel performance tuning.
Please, just use time, cat, dd, etc.
	mount /dev/xxx /mnt/yyy
	dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/yyy/x bs=1M count=1024
	umount /dev/xxx
	mount /dev/xxx /mnt/yyy
	time cat /mnt/yyy/x > /dev/null
nice'n'easy.
