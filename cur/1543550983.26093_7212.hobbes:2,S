First, as Harold Oga mentioned, the USB hid driver is a
full-blown driver for all sorts of HID devices.
The HIDBP mouse and keyboard drivers support the
"HID Boot Protocol," which is minimal support for
mice and keyboards during system boot, or it might
be enough support for systems that use basic devices
(no keyboard hot ["internet"] keys, etc.) and/or
for embedded systems.  For example, I can & do often
get by with using HIDBP mouse/keyboard when using X
(but mostly for testing).
Now on to the /dev/input drivers (best answer is to
consult with Vojtech@suse.cz or see if there is
anything is linux/Documentation/input*):
These are "logical" device drivers.  They don't
handle any physical devices, but they provide
consistent logical connections between physical device
drivers [whether it's USB, PS/2, AT interface, serial, ...]
for input devices (keyboards, mice, joysticks,
gamepads, & other generic input "events") and
app-level software that uses them.
