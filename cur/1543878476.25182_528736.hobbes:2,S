Come back when you're done doing the "nyah-nyeh I can't hear you" routine and
start paying attention when people point out crucial facts - like the fact
that Bonnie benchmarks that rely on compressing large files full of zeros
aren't relevant unless you're in the exceedingly small minority of users who
are interested in compressing large files full of zeros. Heck, I've had
systems where compression was interesting - but I'm willing to admit that 
it's somewhat a corner case.
