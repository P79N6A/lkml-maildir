I have not admitted any such thing.  I have said the key and signature
do not have separate copyright protection.  Variables named "i" in a
file are not protected by copyright, but they are very much part of
the source code in that file.

Where in the Tivo hardware is the signing key?  There is a related key
in the hardware, but that one is not used to generate an integral part
of the kernel binary.
