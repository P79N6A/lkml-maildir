The errors in the defconfig build (with CONFIG_SYSCTL=y) are unrelated
to the undefined reference found in the allnoconfig build.  The errors
in this build are..
kernel/power/swsusp.c: In function `alloc_pagedir':
kernel/power/swsusp.c:608: sorry, unimplemented: inlining failed in call to 'free_pagedir': function body not available
kernel/power/swsusp.c:646: sorry, unimplemented: called from here
make[2]: [kernel/power/swsusp.o] Error 1 (ignored)
Adrian Bunk has submitted a patch for this.

Frank's patch did not fix the undefined reference to randomize_va_space.
I suspect it is a CONFIG_SYSCTL=n problem as well since it only appears
in the allnoconfig build.
