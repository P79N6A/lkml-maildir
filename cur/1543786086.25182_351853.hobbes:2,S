Even if the reverse engineered component was deemed unacceptable, I'd like to 
see the (other) differences between the two drivers merged ASAP. AFAIK, the 
10.x pwc driver supports the v4l2 API which is useful, and as you mentioned 
actually works on more camera (the 9.x versions just spam errors to dmesg on 
my PWC740K).
