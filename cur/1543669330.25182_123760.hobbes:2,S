Well, there are two obvious methods.  The first, which I've
implemented, builds a tree at start time, which assumes things stay
static, but has significant startup overhead.
The fully dynamic solution (which personality + emul_prefix gives you
at the moment) means that you double every open, every stat, quadruple
every readlink, etc.  Of course, remember to handle relative paths (my
current code punts on this in the hope that noone will notice: we'll
see).
Unfortunately, it's not just /lib and /usr/lib, there's
/var/run/.nscd_socket which doesn't seem to like speaking wrong
endian.
Hey, I'd *love* read-only union mounts which can be done by non-root
(and obviously don't survive exec), but AFAICT noone but Al can write
one acceptable to the VFS maintainer 8).
Rusty.
