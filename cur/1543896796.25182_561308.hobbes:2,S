Still catching up from my laptop dying.
I find the explanation of /sys/subsystem almost unintelligible.  What will the 
new one actually look like?
If I want to find all block devices in the system, it looks like I should now 
look at /sys/subsystem/block.  (And "subsystem" is not a variable here but 
the actual directory name?  I presume it moved for Feng Shui reasons.)  
If I want to find char devices, where do I look?  /sys/subsystem...  char?  
class?  Is a char device now anything under /sys/subsystem that is _not_ 
in /sys/subsystem/block?  (Minus bus devices?)  Is there a specific directory 
for these?
This document is highly polluted with what NOT to do.  I'm looking for a 
clear "what SHOULD I do", and it takes some wading to find it.  (Historical 
cruft about what not to do is potentially a separate document, it's not 
useful for people learning this stuff now who weren't playing with the legacy 
mechanisms.)  The description of /sys/subsystem spends so much time talking 
about old legacy issues it never gives a clear description of the new way of 
doing things, which is theoretically what this document is about...
