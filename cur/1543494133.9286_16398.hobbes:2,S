Exactly. Just as a umount forces writing of all buffers, it must
invalidate the buffers. I'm curious why noone noticed that earlier.

Well, they managed a fix for this later, at least I had trouble when I
formatted a disk with a still open file in another machine. Excel would
insist to get the old floppy back. But no data corruption occurred to me.
