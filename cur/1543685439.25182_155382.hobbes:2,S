Mike,
Actually, using APM was not done on purpose.  It was configured in already
from our Red Hat 9 install.  We really don't need any Power Management at
all, since it is not a lap top.  I have not tried the ACPI at all.  I did
try the allow_ints feature (test #5), but it still locked up.  From this
test I gathered that it was not some "cli" that was never undone.  So maybe
the BIOS hoses something?

I'm curious why you are using the APM method.
Have you tried ACPI(which replaced APM a long time ago)
And also out of curiosity, have you played with the config_apm_allow_ints?
