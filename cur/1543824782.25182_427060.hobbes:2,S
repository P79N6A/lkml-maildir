2.6.16 ran all night on the above test with the s_umount locking fix in it.
The prune_dcache/unmount race was indeed the cause of the errors I have
been seeing over the last week.
I just found a bug in the -mm patch which broke shrink_dcache_parent().
This is the likely cause of the above problems, and I'm about to retest
the -mm kernel with the fixed patch.....
Cheers,
Dave.
