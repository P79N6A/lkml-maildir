A quick check of the headers on the two copies that I received
reveal that linux-kernel was not being used to expand the message.
Received: from cthulhu.engr.sgi.com (cthulhu.engr.sgi.com [192.26.80.2])

This header show that the message was headed for me directly
from an internal SGI system. My personal guess is that they
collected the names of all the people who posted to linux-kernel
and mailed them. They probably merged in the linux CREDITS
file and then forgot to remove duplicates.
