	It is a module, as long as you never unload it..
	In 2.3.* series it is module, but the module itself
	contains code which makes sure that non-hackers won't
	unload it accidentally.  (But allows smaller initial
	kernel image size.)
	I think I did at least once fix it so that it *can* be
	unloaded, but I have been way too busy to bring that to
	current level..
	Yes, here is that old diff:
