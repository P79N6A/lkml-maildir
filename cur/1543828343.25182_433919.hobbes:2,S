H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e Expands the Creative Palette for Independent Filmmakers GLENDALE, CA--(MARKET WIRE)--May 31, 2006 -- H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e, Inc. A provider of digital intermediate film mastering services, announced today that its Matchframe Digital Intermediate division is currently providing full digital intermediate services for Super 16MM productions.
H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e, Inc. (H.Y.W.I - News), a provider of digital intermediate film mastering services, announced that High Definition preview masters as part of its normal digital intermediate service offerings and workflow.
"Typically, in current post-production workflow, HD dailies masters are edited into high quality preview masters including color timing, dirt removal, opticals and visual effects," said David Waters, H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e president. "Unfortunately, none of these processes translate to the theatrical release of the film as they must all be duplicated or repeated in either a higher resolution digital format, or photo chemical process."
H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e gives Motion Picture producers the ability to scan their selected original camera negative at 2k or 4k film resolution, conform a high resolution digital master for theatrical and broadcast release including dirt removal, opticals and visual effects, and output a High Definition preview master to be used for preview screenings and focus groups that can be deployed in any worldwide theater location.
"The challenge for completing the final editorial decisions on a motion picture are balanced between the ability to display the highest resolution picture for a test audience, and the costs and time in having to re-master your film based on a test audience response," said Jim Delany, H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e COO.

Top of the morning.    Stop and smell the roses. Say it with flowers.   To rule the mountains is to rule the river.   Under the weather. Slow as molasses in January. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.  Shit happens.   Shit end of the stick. Sweating blood.   Walking on thin ice. Under the weather. Put that in your pipe and smoke it.   Worry often gives a small thing a big shadow. What's good for the goose is good for the gander. Rain, rain go away; come again some other day. Sweet as apple pie.   Two peas in a pod.  There is always next year.   Waking up with the chickens. Spring to mind.   Say it with flowers.   Weed it out.  Walking on water.
Sitting on the fence. She's a nut.   Watch and wait.  What's done is done.  A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. Take time to smell the roses. Plant kindness and gather love.   Sour as a green apple.   Useless as tits on bull.   A rose is a rose is a rose. Speak softly and carry a big stick.   A thorn in my side.   Want my place in the sun.  We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.  Rough as a cob. Shake like a leaf. Wrinkled as a prune.
