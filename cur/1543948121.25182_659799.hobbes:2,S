it's OK if you use it full time and if you are amongst the 0.001% of the 
developer population we call "the best kernel hackers on the planet" ;-) 
It sucks badly if you use it occasionally and have to re-learn its 
non-trivial usage and its quirks every time. As it happens, most 
userspace developers are in this second category.
(and i'm not worried about the first category at all - if needed they 
can write their own OS from scratch ;-)
