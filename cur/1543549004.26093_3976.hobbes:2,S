Ok, I may be dense, but I see the bug.
And no, your patch was not the right thing either. It _will_ make that
particular corruption go away, but it's a more insidious problem, and your
patch only addreses part of the whole problem.
The basic problem is that right now we have code that does 
	if (!page->buffers)
		create_empty_buffers(page, inode, inode->i_sb->s_blocksize);
	...
	if (!buffer_uptodate(bh))
		ll_rw_block(READ, 1, &bh);
And this is WRONG.
If the whole page is up-to-date, we must NOT try to read the buffer in
from disk, because the in-memory copy is always more up-to-date.
Normally this bug shows itself only as a small performance issue - if we
only use read() and write(), all changes to the page will be done
"synchronously" with "page->buffers" being held, and as such the page will
never have contents that are newer than the on-disk image. But whenever
somebody writes to the page through a shared mapping, that is no longer
true - we MUST NOT do the buffer read, because it's going to overwrite
data that is newer than the disk contents.
The bug again didn't show up in the trivial test-cases, because it depends
on us "losing" the page buffers and having to re-create them in order to
show up, and that only happens under memory pressure.
Basically, both "truncate()" and "write()" have this bug where they can
end up re-reading stuff from disk even though the in-memory copy is newer.
And because write() had this bug, the bug also got into
block_write_full_page(). Not because block_write_full_page() was buggy in
itself, but because it used a buggy routine.
And your patch fixes the corruption, not by fixing the bug, but by
avoiding the buggy routing in block_write_full_page().
We need to fix the real bug - otherwise anybody doing both write() and
shared mmap's to the same file is going to be bit by it later on...
The easy fix is probably to do something like
	/* Map the buffer */
	if (!buffer_mapped(bh)) {
		...
	}
+	/* If the page is up-to-date, so is the buffer */
+	if (Page_Uptodate(page))
+		set_bit(BH_Uptodate, &bh->b_state);
	/* Ok, now it was _truly_ not uptodate */
	if (!buffer_uptodate(bh))
		ll_rw_block(READ, 1, &bh);
Comments? The above should fix block_write_full_page() automatically, as
well as fixing the other cases too - and actually improve performance at
the same time by getting rid of unnecessary re-reads.
Looks fairly simple. It only happens in __block_prepare_write() and in
block_truncate_page(), so there's just two places to fix.
Can you se anything else wrong?
