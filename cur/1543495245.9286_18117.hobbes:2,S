Hi,
We've got problems with a Dell PowerEdge 2200 machine, Dual
P2-333. I'm currently running 2.0.36 with SMP and MTRR enabled
as that's the only configuration that works a little. (MTRR
doesn't seem to matter though).
This machine is a Quake/QuakeWorld/Quake II server and we're
not getting the performance we need out of it. The 2nd CPU
(which was added later) always reports a mere 132 bogomips,
opposed to the 331 from the 1st CPU. As you can see below it
also reports the MHz's too low (just noticed that now).
If I run a 2.2.x kernel (I've tried a number of them) the
machine behaves very weird. Connecting to one of the Quake-
servers takes a long time, sounds repeat, there's a very high
ping and packetloss (according to the Quake client anyway),
and it doesn't take long before you get totally disconnected.
Very erratic behaviour, and totally unusable.
I've also done some other performance tests with the rc564
client in both single and multithreaded operation. While I
don't have numbers at hand, the performance was extremely
poor, giving not even the performance of a single CPU. While
also not good enough under 2.0.36, the speed is a lot better
there than under 2.2.x.
From a Dual PowerEdge 2300 which we have here at the office
I know the Quakeservers to be working excellent on a 2.2.x
SMP setup. So at least that's not the problem.
I don't know much about this all, so I'm asking here. Should
it work well with different stepping CPU's? Or is it perhaps
some hardware problem? (Doesn't explain why 2.0.36 works fairly
well, and 2.2.x screws up totally).
Unfortunately this machine is in production and I can't take
it down at will. And I'm not 100% sure that the BIOS settings
(if any) are correct. The machine is with our other servers
on another location, and the people there don't know much about
PC's. The BIOS is the latest available for the machine.
Below is some information I gathered under 2.2.7 SMP before I
returned it to 2.0.36. Anyone have any insight/info/etc for me?
Regards,
Pascal Eeftinck
