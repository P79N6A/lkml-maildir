If you are talking about the discontig memory support, yes, I have thought
about that and arrived at the conclusion that rather than overdesign
right now, we will have to see how things work out on a real machine. 
There's been some arguments against per-zone, or per-node kswapd's, 
so the other alternative is to pass the list of unbalanced zones to
kswapd, which can then scan only the unbalanced ones. This is the 
best solution when there are fairly large number of nodes.
