Subject: kernel thread scheduling question

I have a kernel thread that I would like to have run at least
every 1-2 miliseconds.
I think I would be happy if there were a way to have the
process yield/schedule() at least once per ms with the
understanding that it would get to wake again 1-2ms later.
Is there a way to do such a thing without hacking up the
scheduler code?
I have tried 2.6.4 with pre-empt, and setting the thread priority
to -18, but I still see cases where the process is starved for 20+
milliseconds every 3-5 seconds or so.  Other than this single
process, there is not a big load on the system.
Any suggestions are welcome.
Thanks,
Ben
