It is equivalent to allocating anymous memory in programs.
In theory you could limit it for each user by RLIMIT_NPROC*RLIMIT_AS,
but in practice that would be usually
If Linux ever gets a "max memory total used per user" rlimit it may make
sense to limit the shm growth caused by them to that, but that is not
there yet. In addition I want to point out that there are a zillion
of subsystems which can be used to allocate quite a lot of memory
(e.g. fill the socket buffers of a few hundred sockets)
So far nobody knows how to limit all of these and it's probably too hard
to do. The general wisdom is that if you want strong isolation like
that use a virtualized environment.

shmmni will stay, although the defaults will be larger. If you really
want you can lower it, but in practice it won't buy you much if anything.
