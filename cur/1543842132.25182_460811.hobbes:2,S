I once (2.6.12?) had to copy a quite large directory to an XFS
partition. It "should" had fit onto it (by what df said), but I ran into
"disk full". I think the reason was related to a large xfsbufd_centisecs
or xfssyncd_centisecs and indeed I could watch free space to grow and
shrink in regulaer intervals (watch df -k). I may well be wrong here (as
I'm sure no XFS-expert), but it looked like old data gets some kind of
"comressed" or "ordered" by the XFS-driver while newly written data took
more place. A "slow" copy did it, as well as a later try to an reiserfs
or ext.
