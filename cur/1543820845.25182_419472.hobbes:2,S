Please let me summarize:
	1) Many people are more efficient writing C++ modules.
	2) It does not make sense to rewrite existing C code in
	   another language.
	3) Kernel H-files are not compilable by g++.
	4) The H-files use C++ keywords.
	5) The H-files use member initialization syntax, unsupported
	   by g++.
	6) The H-files use empty structures which are not empty in
	   g++.
4), 5) and 6) are to be fixed if we want to be g++-friendly. I am not 
aware of any other issues. Features like static constructors and 
exceptions are not strictly necessary for successful C++ programming.
4) must be trivial.
5) is less trivial but still doable. Can we ask g++ folks?
6) looks rather painful.
What do you think?
Regards
Roman
