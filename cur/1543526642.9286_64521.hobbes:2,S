Hello, I am writing a block device driver to redirect all I/O requests to a 
remote hard disk at another node. The remote hd seems "attached" locally. The 
process accessing the driver (i.e. the client) has to communicate with a 
remote server process through sockets.
However, I found that if these two processes are running at the same node, 
i.e. the client sleeps in the request_fn of the virtual device, and waiting 
for the local server to complete and return the I/O results, all the processes 
seems dead (in uninterruptible sleeping mode), and the kernel dies eventually, 
coz' even the bdflush will "hang".
I would like to ask whether there are any problems if one process is sleeping 
in the request_fn, but waiting for another process to access the hard disk. In 
this case, the first one won't return until the second process finished the 
real I/O. Note that the fake block device and the real hard disk are two 
separate block devices in my implementation.
I am not very familiar with FS and buffer cache, may be somebody have time to 
help this kernel-newbee... Thanks in advance!
