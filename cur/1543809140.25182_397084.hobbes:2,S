Indeed.

Which is what I say each time.

Why not have udev and whatever comes after tell the kernel so that a
symlink is done in sysfs?  The kernel not deciding policy do not
prevent it from storing and giving back userland-provided information.
You get the best of both worlds, complete device information including
how to talk with it in sysfs, and complete naming and policy setting
in userspace.

Why manage a directory tree in udev when you have a perfectly good one
in sysfs already.  We're talking about a friggin' userland-provided
string here, nothing more.

I guess you didn't bother to read the "answer 3" paragraph of my
email.  Do you trust udev to still exist two years from now, given
that hotplug died in less than that?  Do you trust udevinfo to have
the same interface two years from now given that the current interface
is already incompatible with a not even two-years old one (udev 039,
15-Oct-2004 according to kernel.org) which is widely deployed as part
of fedora core 3?
Of course I can always go the ALSA way, hardcode the device names and
tell udev (and the user) to fuck off.
  OG.
