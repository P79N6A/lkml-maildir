Aha - this is a problem we have seen a few more times recently.
Scancode 0x7d, well-known from Japanese keyboards, has keycode 124
under 2.4 and keycode 183 under 2.6.
There are many solutions, and searching for "keycode 183" will
show you a few. A quick-n-dirty solution for you is to replace
the 183 in the array atkbd_set2_keycode[] in atkbd.c by 124.
Will look at your USB problem later.

[PS - Your strange 1,55 release is because 1*128+55 = 183.
The new kernel breaks old keyboard utilities. Bad.]
