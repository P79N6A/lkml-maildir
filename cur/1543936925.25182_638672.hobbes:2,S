The patch does not fix the problem here. When I boot plain git-x86
upto commit 67db3027d691ff8049d19be7bc440eca0e5826d7
on my 6GB machine I still get an recursive oops on entering user space.
The only difference to earlier kernels seems to be that the problem
happens a little latter (in stty, not boot), but that might be just
coincidence.
