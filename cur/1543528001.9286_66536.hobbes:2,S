As soon as you drop the inode_lock spinlock the variable called "entry"
gets invalidated and you have to revalidate it as soon as you reacquire
the lock or you risk to reference something that is not there anymore.
(Side note: In practice the inode.c in 2.2.x is called always with the big
kernel lock held so in practice it's only the schedule() that invalidates
the variable called "entry" but don't relay on this! ;)
