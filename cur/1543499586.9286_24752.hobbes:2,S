Ok. Redhat 6.0 no longer has radadd like rh5.2 did. Instead it has mkraid
to make a raid device and raidstart to fire it up.
I managed to get the raid1 device to work under the rh6.0 standard kernel
from their RPM. However, when I compiled my 2.2.10 kernel (and yes I did
include raid support) it comes up with the above error when I run
raidstart
In other words:
raidstart /dev/md0 works under the RH 2.2.5 kernel
but not under the 2.2.10 kernel
This is the end of the strace of raidstart /dev/md0
