The current HFS code doesn't work with HFS-formatted CD-ROM with 2k block
size.  I do not really know if it's HFS fs' fault or not, though.
Attempts to mount a 2k-block HFS formated CD-ROM produce the following
kernel message on 2.4.0-test5:
Aug  9 08:49:03 localhost kernel: sr.c:Bad 2K block number requested (2 1)
I/O error: dev 0b:00, sector 2 
Aug  9 08:49:03 localhost kernel: hfs_fs: unable to read block 0x00000002
from dev 0b:00 
Aug  9 08:49:03 localhost kernel: hfs_fs: Unable to read superblock 
Aug  9 08:49:03 localhost kernel: sr.c:Bad 2K block number requested (0 1)
I/O error: dev 0b:00, sector 0 
Aug  9 08:49:03 localhost kernel: hfs_fs: unable to read block 0x00000000
from dev 0b:00 
Aug  9 08:49:03 localhost kernel: hfs_fs: Unable to read block 0. 
I can see that hfs_fs and SCSI CD-ROM drivers don't agree on block number
to be accessed.  Is this not a bug?
