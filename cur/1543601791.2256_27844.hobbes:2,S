Be warned, while the above will improve latency, it will not improve the
numbers reported by the tool.  The reason is that the tool looks at
actual preemption disable times, so it does not care if "need_resched"
is set or not.  This means that, in the case where need_resched is not
set, the tool would report a long latency as if the conditional lock
break code was not present.  To get the above code into the tools
purview, you could either code it without the conditional or, better,
put the whole thing into a macro ( I think Ingo called it
"conditional_schedule()") and put the instrumentation stuff in the
macro.  Also, in the case of a system with the preemption patch, the
schedule is not needed unless the BKL is also held.

Uh, trying to find???  These are the names and line numbers provided by
the PPC macros.  The only time the address is helpful is when the bad
guy is hiding in an "inline" in a header file.  Still, is there a simple
script to get the function/offset from the System.map?  We could then
post process with a simple bash/sed script.

Ah, but we would REALLY like to see it below 1msec.
