Hi,
with CONFIG_HZ_300=y I see these warnings :
...
kernel/time.c: In function 'msecs_to_jiffies':                                                                                                               
kernel/time.c:472: warning: integer constant is too large for 'long' type

I think this was introduced by :
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=bdc807871d58285737d50dc6163d0feb72cb0dc2
If you need more infos let me know.
