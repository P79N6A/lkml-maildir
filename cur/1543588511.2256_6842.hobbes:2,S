No it doesn't.  It allows you to search for files of a specific naming
pattern and greps those.  So if you needed to know the maintainers of all
the config.in files, you say:
find . -name "*onfig.in" -type f -print | xargs grep 'P: '
If you need to know the maintainer(s) of a specific file or directory of
files, simply direct your search there.  The only problem occurs when you
really don't know where to look - so then you search the entire kernel for
the configuration option, and look wherever you find that.
I really don't see the problem.
