One side note on your patch: the pure bit _test_ operation is very cheap, 
but the "bit change" operation is very expensive (and not really any less 
expensive than the "test-and-change" one).
So the patch to avoid "test_and_clear_bit()" really helps only if the test 
usually results in us not doing the clear. Is that the case? Hmm..
So I _think_ that at least the case in "isolate_lru_page()", you'd 
actually be better off doing the "test-and-clear" instead of separate 
"test" and "clear-bit" ops, no? In that one, it would seem that 99+% of 
the time, the bit is set (because we tested it just before getting the 
lock).
No?

Yes.
Now, that whole "we might touch the page count" thing does actually worry 
me a bit. The locking rules are subtle (but they -seem- safe: before we 
actually really put the page on the free-list in the freeing path, we'll 
have locked the LRU list if it was on one).
But if you were to change _that_ one to a
	atomic_add_unless(&page->counter, 1, -1);
I think that would be a real cleanup. And at that point I won't even 
complain that "atomic_inc_test()" is faster - that "get_page_testone()" 
thing is just fundamentally a bit scary, so I'd applaud it regardless.
(The difference: the "counter skewing" may be unexpected, but it's just a 
simple trick. In contrast, the "touch the count after the page may be 
already in the freeing stage" is a scary subtle thing. Even if I can't 
see any actual bug in it, it just worries me in a way that offsetting a 
counter by one does not..)
