Just to clarify, this means that the "inode numbers" reported by an
msdos filesystem are a function of the disk-layout itself (i.e. they
are determined at mount time), and not numbers created when the file
is first accessed (AFAIK).
However, other filesystems are free to do this in other ways.  Reiserfs
has 64-bit "inode numbers" (actually "packing locality" + unique ID),
as does NTFS and XFS.  Network filesystems may do something completely
different (I have no idea what SMBFS does).
Cheers, Andreas
