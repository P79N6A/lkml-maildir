Only for a single calculation whenever it has to adjust, which should only 
happen every 49.7 days (on 32-bit archs). (Or 5 minutes after booting... 
I always wondered why that happened and now I see it's initialised so it 
always wraps early). Whilst it is in sync with jiffies it will not affect 
the process - count is just set to the current value every time. Even with 
NO_HZ because jiffies will be correct when calc_load is called.

On HZ=1000, this would cause the load average to be pushed towards +1.00 
for up to 2 minutes every ~83 minutes with no obvious cause. (If a task 
takes ~10-20ms to run, so 20 runs are needed at HZ=1000 before it passes 
it again).
On HZ=100 it would happen every ~8 minutes for up to 10 seconds and never 
be noticed.
Using 5*HZ+2 would move this to ~167 and ~17 minutes which would mitigate 
the effect further still without changing the exp values.
1884.25 -> 1883.62
2014.15 -> 2014.02
2036.65 -> 2036.61
Will anyone notice if the load is adjusted slightly less frequently?
If this is considered preferable to adjusting calc_load to avoid almost all 
round_jiffies scheduled tasks (some of which may take longer than ~15ms to 
run), then I have no problems with it - I just needed something to stop my 
driver changes doing odd things to the load average for other people. I'll 
continue to run with this version, is it possible to add a Kconfig option 
for it somewhere?
