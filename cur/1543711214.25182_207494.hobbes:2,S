Hi Robert,

Takashi benchmarked the worst case latency in very good detail.  2.6
stock with PREEMPT=y has a worst case latency of 2.4-aa. This is a fact.
With Takashi's lowlatency fixes the latency goes below 2.4-aa, w/ or w/o
PREEMPT.
PREEMPT=y doesn't and cannot improve the worst case latency. This is
true today like it was true 4 years ago.

I don't think they can matter when the worst case is below 0.2msec.

I want to implement my aged idea that is to do the opposite of preempt.
I believe that is a much more efficient way to smooth the curve at lower
overhead and no kernel complexity.
Preempt is always enabled as soon as the cpu enters kernel. And it can
be disabled on demand.
I want preempt to be disabled as soon as teh cpu enters kernel, and I
want to enable it on demand _only_ during the copy user, or similar cpu
intensive operations, also guaranteeing that those operations comes to
an end to avoid RCU starvation.
Then I would like to ompare the average latency (the curve) I doubt
they'll be any different, and the overhead will be zero (we've to check
need_resched anyways after a copy-user, so we can as well do
preempt_enable preembt_disable around it).

It's not a big issue of course (very low prio thing ;).
