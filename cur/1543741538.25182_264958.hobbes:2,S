I have no problems (I hope!), but the warnings I get when linux (2.6.9) 
tries to probe a non existant IDE device (controller/channel (?) not  
hard disk) are slightly over the top..
1. Are these warnings usual for a nonexistant IDE drive?
2. Could they be toned down?
Exclamation marks might be appropriate if after the SIS ide controller  
had been detected one of its channels (ide0/1) could not be probed, but  
unless my hardware is not reacting as expected they are just "noise".
