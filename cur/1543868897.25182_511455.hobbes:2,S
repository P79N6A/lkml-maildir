Took  a quick look. If I used scatterlist, I'd still need to build a
list of scatterlist to pass to the driver callback. The alternative
being a preallocated array of scatterlist based on the page count of
the framebuffer, which seems expensive since scatterlist has page,
offset, dma and length.
On a separate note, Peter pointed out that it may be possible to reuse
page->lru instead of using a struct page_list. This would enable
something like:
in mkwrite:
mutex_lock
list_add(page->lru, defio->pagelist)
mutex_unlock
in deferred handler:
mutex_lock
for_each page {
lock_page
mkclean
unlock_page
}
callback(fb_info, pagelist)
for_each page {
list_del
}
mutex_unlock
The advantage of reusing page->lru is that avoids needing the struct
page_list and allocation in mkwrite. Is the above exploitation of
->lru ok with mm folk?
In above, we're iterating over the page list twice. I have to mkclean
before calling the callback to avoid the situation where a touched
page is missed by the callback. I don't see a way around that part.
Thanks,
