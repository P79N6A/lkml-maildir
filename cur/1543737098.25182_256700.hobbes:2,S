Th CPU is not that busy:
2.6.9-rc2-mm4 Results and iostat outputs:
http://khack.osdl.org/stp/297714/
http://khack.osdl.org/stp/297714/results/bufferrand/iostat.txt
2.6.9-rc2 Results and iostat outputs:
http://khack.osdl.org/stp/297545/
http://khack.osdl.org/stp/297545/results/bufferrand/iostat.txt
The iostat has the write stats followed by the reads, taken every 15
seconds.
