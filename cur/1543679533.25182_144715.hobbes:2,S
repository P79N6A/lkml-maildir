yes, especially considering what William said above.
But the point here is not to measure scalability in absolute terms, the
point IMHO is the scalability regression introduced by rmap (w/o
objrmap).
The fact the kernel workload isn't the most scalable thing on earth,
simply means other workloads doing the same thing that make+gcc does - but
never serializing in linking - will be hurted even more.
