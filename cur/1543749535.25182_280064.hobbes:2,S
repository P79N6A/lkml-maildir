All of these schedule_timeout() calls are broken. They do not set the
state before hand and therefore will return early. Since you're not
checking for signals and there are no waitqueue events around the
code, I'm assuming you can just use ssleep(1) instead of the current
schedule_timeout() calls.
Thanks,
Nish
