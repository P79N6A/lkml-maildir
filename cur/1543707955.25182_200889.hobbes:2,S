This machine is starting to head south again.  I've updated user.log (a
bunch of stats I'm syslogging) at
http://depot.mtholyoke.edu:8080/tmp/.
  I've also added
http://depot.mtholyoke.edu:8080/tmp/mist/10/,
 which contains the latest 
smokeping graphs.
In about an hour or two, I'll likely have to head in to get this thing
back on its feet.  I will try the suggestions above, to see if that will
do the trick.  Is there anything else I should try to do or look at?  Once
I reboot (if that's what I have to do), I expect it will be a couple of
days before this happens again.
