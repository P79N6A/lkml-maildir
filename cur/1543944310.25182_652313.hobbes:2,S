Yep.  I do that with the powerpc tree sometimes, too:  I'll ACK a 
drivers/net change that is obviously PPC-specific, and that drivers/net 
change will go in via paulus.
Like you said, it's done on a per-patch not git tree basis at the moment.
That sort of cooperation has become common: in areas of shared 
responsibility, request an ack, and then the "most obvious" person 
(generally the one with most merge dependencies) merges that 
shared-responsibility change along with some other changes specific to 
their own tree.
