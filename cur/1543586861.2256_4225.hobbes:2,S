Two possibilities: With std configuration language change:
: bool 'std IPC support' CONFIG_IPC
into
: bool 'arch specific IPC help' CONFIG_IPC_STRANGE_ARCH
: define_bool CONFIG_IPC CONFIG_IPC_STRANGE_ARCH
This is "clean" and is allowed by CML1 (and in CML2 with a
similar change).
Or we can use the method of Johan.
But if we move some option in i386/Configure.help, users of
other arch
instead of being little confused, their will see no help ->
worse!
Maybe before to make changes, all developers should read the
documentation
and update/change it in a non i386 centric view.
BTW some other arch will use i386 devices, thus or we
duplicate (and
that one of the copy will be old) some entry of we must make
configure.help
i386 centric (and provide other help for other arch). But
SPARC and SPARC64
will use some configuration (different to i386), thus we
should duplicate
half configuration in SPARC.. ?
