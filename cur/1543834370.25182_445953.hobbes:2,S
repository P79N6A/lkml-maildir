The way you wrote this, makes it sound like a userspace issue, and _not_ a 
problem with reiserfs.

Not entirely true, he did not abandon the 2.4 kernel branch, he passed on 
maintainership to Marcelo. Similar to how he passed the torch on the 2.2 
kernel branch to Alan Cox. Also on a side note, many new features ( and a ton 
of bug fixes !! ) were added to the 2.4 series _after_ Linus started working 
on the 2.5 branch.
