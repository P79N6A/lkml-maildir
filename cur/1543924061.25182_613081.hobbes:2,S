Well, emm. Eric already tried to solve this issue in the similar way
(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/26/414
), but I have recently sent a
more generic patch set. It turns all the namespaces off with the 
config options, but Andrew said to wait until the next -mm tree to 
rework the set.
With this set we'll be able to mark pid namespaces as EXPERIMENTAL
or even BROKEN, so nobody will be able to crate them. So can we, please, 
keep things as they are for now - the appropriate fix will be ready 
soon.
Thanks,
Pavel
