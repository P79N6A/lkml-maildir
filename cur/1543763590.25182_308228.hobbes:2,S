Nope, that sounds just about right.  Buggy BIOSes that implement ACPI
via SMM (or so I have been told) can stall the machine for over a
millisecond, this is why some laptops lose timer ticks at HZ=1000.  The
issue is well known by Linux audio users, as it causes big problems for
people who buy laptops for live audio use.
A list of known good/bad machines would be a tremendous help, but no one
knows the exact extent of the problem.  All Acer laptops seem to be
affected.
Hardware manufacturers (laptops anyway) don't seem to care about
anything below 1-2ms because Windows uses HZ=100 and the ASIO drivers on
that platform only go down to about ~1.5 ms latency.
