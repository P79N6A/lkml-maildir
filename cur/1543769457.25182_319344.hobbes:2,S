It's quite dangerous. I suppose it uses this for atomic.h, but it
means that a mysql compiled under a uniprocessor kernel (or rather
with a autoconf.h of a uniprocessor kernel, it can even be SMP) will
have subtle races when run on a SMP system because the atomic
instructions will miss lock prefixes. Sounds like an open
deathtrap to me.
I would suggest changing MySQL to keep its own copies of atomic.h
for the different architectures. Then they can drop the asm/system.h
includes too.
