I figured you did, as the explanation was mostly for people who don't.

Hmm, didn't know this, but it makes sence for ext2/3 since they use 1 block
per file/directory.  It wouldn't do much good to waste more space for inode
tables than you could even theoretically use.

Interesting, somewhere I think I saw that it was using 512 byte blocks, but
don't ask me where I saw that or who said it.

With how many directories?  Do you run into drive speed limitations with
that much meta-data, or are there still bottlenecks in the
journaling/hashing to deal with? How big are the reiser3/4 equivalents to
inodes?  In ext2/3 they're currently 128 bytes I believe plus some static
bitmaps in the block groups.  The only thing variable in ext2/3 are the
directory sizes (and they don't shrink... :( )

Hmm, isn't XFS slower than ext2/3 in that regard?
