They should. Writing a protocol in the 90ies which does not support
path mtu discovery is a very bad idea. Fragmented packets mean that
the congestion avoidance algorithms used by TCP have much worse performance
than otherwise. You should either do pmtudisc yourself, or at least allow
the end2end hosts to do it themselves (second is better)
If you want to support IPv6 you'll need that anyways. DF is the default
there and cannot be turned off.

Just set the MTU of the device correct.  Then it'll happen for you.
