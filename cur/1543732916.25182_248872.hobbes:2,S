This is actually a good sign if this is the most common one you see. 
The netif_receive softirq is basically the longest code path that can't
easily be made preemptible; on my hardware about 150 usecs seems to be
the best we can do.  This is really good, I can't imagine an application
that you would use PC hardware for where 150 usecs is not enough, though
I am sure the hard realtime crowd has a few.
Even fixing this one would not help much because it seems there are many
other non-preemtible code paths that are only a little shorter than this
one.
