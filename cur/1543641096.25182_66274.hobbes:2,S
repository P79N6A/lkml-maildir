I don't understand this argument.  Suppose lru list membership is worth a 
page count of one.  Then anyone who finds a page by way of the lru list can 
safely put_page_testzero and remove the page from the lru list.  Anyone who 
finds a page by way of a page table can likewise put_page_testzero and clear 
the pte, or remove the mapping and pass the page to Andrew's pagevec 
machinery, which will eventually do the put_page_testzero.  Anyone who 
removes a page from a radix tree will also do a put_page_testzero.  Exactly 
one of those paths will result in the page count reaching zero, which tells 
us nobody else holds a reference and it's time for __free_pages_ok.  The page 
is thus freed immediately as soon as there are no more references to it, and 
does not hang around on the lru list.
Nobody has to lock against the page count.  Each put_page_testzero caller 
only locks the data structure from which it's removing the reference.
This seems so simple, what is the flaw?
