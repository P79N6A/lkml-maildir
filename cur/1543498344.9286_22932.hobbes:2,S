Very occasionally people have discussed here how fast their version of
`find' runs on BSD vs. Linux, written in Perl or not.  There's also the
odd discussion of how to make `ls' faster.
I wrote a similar program for arcane reasons (make Squid start faster),
realised how to optimise the I/O for that case, and then tweaked the
program a bit more.  Time to announce it.
You can find the full announcement (posted to comp.os.linux.announce)

Here's the intro:
Description
-----------
Treescan finds all the files in a directory tree and prints their
names, using an optimised disk access strategy.
It is similar to `find -print'.  The added feature is that Treescan
optimises the I/O in various ways.  It is sometimes much faster than the
naive strategy used by `find'.
There is an option to prime the system cache with the inodes of all the
files found.  This often makes a subsequent program (such as `squid',
`find', `du' etc.) run faster.
Enjoy,
