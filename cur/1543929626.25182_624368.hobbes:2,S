The problem won't recur with NCQ off, because spurious completions are 
impossible in that case.
It was originally thought that these AHCI spurious NCQ completions were 
busted NCQ implementations on the drives, but I think there theory is 
that it's some other timing problem or some such, given the number of 
drives across all makers which are reported to do this. I believe Tejun 
is investigating?
