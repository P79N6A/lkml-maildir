Well, it isn't userspace that is determining *which* allocations are
critical to the kernel.  That is statically determined at compile time by
using the flag __GFP_CRITICAL on specific *kernel* allocations.  Sridhar,
cc'd on this mail, has a set of patches that sprinkle the __GFP_CRITICAL
flag throughout the networking code to take advantage of this pool.
Userspace is in charge of determining *when* we're in an emergency
situation, and should thus use the critical pool, but not *which*
allocations are critical to surviving this emergency situation.

Well, I never suggested it didn't work for my original usage case.  The
discussion we had is that it would be incredibly difficult to 100%
iron-clad guarantee that the pool would NEVER run out of pages.  But we can
size the pool, especially given a decent workload approximation, so as to
make failure far less likely.

Well, that's basically the point of posting these patches as an RFC.  I'm
not quite so delusional as to think they're going to get picked up right
now.  I was, however, hoping for feedback to figure out how to design
infrastructure that *can* be used right, as well as trying to find other
potential users of such a feature.
Thanks!
