It seems that all the ACPI drivers are registered asynchronously after
this change. 
   But there exists some dependency between some ACPI device drivers. It
is not very reasonable that the device driver is loaded asynchronously
if there exists the dependency between some drivers. 
For example: 
   On some boxes the info of battery is related with Embedded
controller. The EC driver should be loaded completely before registering
battery driver.
   On some boxes there exist the devices of ACPI power resource. And the
device power state is transited by controlling power resource. In such
case the power resource device driver should be loaded completely before
transiting the device power state.
Best regards.
