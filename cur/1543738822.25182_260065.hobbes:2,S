Really, no, you don't want to be doing what you are doing in
qs_process_sff_entry()
At certain points you decide you have too much work, disable interrupts
on the card and reschedule the routine in a work queue.
Please, please don't do this.  It's a sure fire recipe for a hang. 
Suppose a prior task in the workqueue needs to page something in from
swap and you're the swap device for instance....
What you need to do is to gather as much information as will reset the
interrupt and then process the data as a tasklet.  For your hotplug
events, they should be fire and forget as schedule_work().
*never* disable interrupts and have re-enabling them contingent on a
workqueue thread.
