Hello folks, 
There was a time people would crash the console simply by switching in and
out of X a few too many times to a TEXT console. I'm quite happy now that
the kernel is handling that now, the calls of "Gerhard the computer broke
again" or finding evidence of somone cycling the power in the logs were
down right aggravating. I'm essentially very lazy and prefer to spend my
time tweaking the system (when I feel like it) and don't like the work
involved in dealing with fs damage caused by a power cycle while something
was writing to disk.
My problems satsfatorally solved by the fb handling the mode switching,
the old way of having whatever device wanting to use anything other than
text mode handle it's own switching was down right stupid and the result
was quite nasty on my system.
Several months ago I flamed several people on this list out of 
frustration, to the point of using harsher words than I should have.
I am happy to say the problems are now fixed on my system, I care very
little that the kernel driver doesn't do accelleration, in fact I don't
care much at all about the short term speed loss while I wait for an x
driver that uses fb for mode changes and does accelleration directly.
To summarise: I don't want to go back to the old way, it works fine now,
please don't try breaking it again.  The kernel seems to be doing just
enough work to make the system run exremely well.
	Gerhard
PS I now only reboot for kernel changes. :)
Good job folks!!!!!!

As a computer I find your faith in technology amusing.
