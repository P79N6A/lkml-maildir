MMX is integer math, 3Dnow is floating point.

The recently-merged new_ia32_branch of gcc supports -march=k6.  There is
no '-march=k7' currently.

There is no MMX or 3Dnow support currently in gcc.  Three separate
patches exist which add minimal MMX support to gcc, but none have been
integrated into the mainline.
