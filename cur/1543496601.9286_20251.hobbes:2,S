Subject: BUG: incorrect inline assembly in asm-i386/system.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Egcs (current CVS version) quits compiling 2.3.3 with:
sched.c: In function `schedule':
sched.c:823: Invalid `asm' statement:
sched.c:823: fixed or forbidden register 6 (bp) was spilled for class
GENERAL_REGS.
As it looks the culprit is switch_to from include/asm-1386/system.h.
So could anyone with enough knowledge of gcc inline assembly tell me how the
constraints should/could be changed in order to satisfy egcs ? :
#define switch_to(prev,next,last) do {					\
	asm volatile("pushl %%esi\n\t"					\
		     "pushl %%edi\n\t"					\
		     "pushl %%ebp\n\t"					\
		     "movl %%esp,%0\n\t"	/* save ESP */		\
		     "movl %3,%%esp\n\t"	/* restore ESP */	\
		     "movl $1f,%1\n\t"		/* save EIP */		\
		     "pushl %4\n\t"		/* restore EIP */	\
		     "jmp __switch_to\n"				\
		     "1:\t"						\
		     "popl %%ebp\n\t"					\
		     "popl %%edi\n\t"					\
		     "popl %%esi\n\t"					\
		     :"=m" (prev->tss.esp),"=m" (prev->tss.eip),	\
		      "=b" (last)					\
		     :"m" (next->tss.esp),"m" (next->tss.eip),		\
		      "a" (prev), "d" (next),				\
		      "b" (prev));					\
} while (0)
