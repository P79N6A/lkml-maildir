Subject: 2.4.21-ac1: CONFIG_SCSI_BUSLOGIC in help?

CONFIG_SCSI_BUSLOGIC mentions "If this driver does not work correctly
without modification, please contact the author, Leonard N. Zubkoff, by
email to lnz@dandelion.com." According to reports posted here, this fine
guy was killed some months ago in an accident, and he isn't mentioned in
MAINTAINERS, but in Configure.help.
Who maintains the buslogic driver today?
