   Oh, yes, I see.  This should fix it.
   
I don't understand why this is even necessary.
What if the interrupt comes in on another processor.  How does this
return from trap behavior avoid that interrupt modifying the signal
and/or scheduling state wrt. the current cpu's task?
I think the change is bogus, we don't do this on sparc64 and things
have been perfectly fine.
And if the change isn't necessary, it's bad to disable interrupts for
a longer period of time than necessary.
