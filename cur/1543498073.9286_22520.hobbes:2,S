Actually, two possible answers:
-- Linux coders are not comparable to the monkeys working in Redmond.
   Their code does not fail.
-- In NT 4, not only are the video drivers in kernel space, but so is
   the windowing system. There is no plan to integrate the X11 server
   in the kernel, so nothing to worry about for the moment.
	--Thomas Pornin, who sees X11 servers die more often than kernels.
