Yes, sounded the same to me too: I couldn't reproduce it or see anything
wrong in the code back then.  But Srihari's info about CONFIG_DEBUG_SLUB
off has helped a lot: I was then able to reproduce it on my x86_64, and
after a lot of staring at the code, the problem became obvious...
[PATCH] slub: fix size adjustment when SLUB_DEBUG off
SLUB was corrupting the anon_vma's spinlock when not configured for
SLUB_DEBUG: the size adjustment necessary for SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU or
constructor was inside the CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG appropriate for poisoning.
