To be fair, the original poster made no indication that he wasn't running a 
64bit kernel. It's obvious from subsequent posts that he isn't.
While I agree pmtmr is sensible on the X2, unlike on x86-64, x86 supports the 
clock= option for overriding the default.
It's really only installing new distros that might be problematic (in which 
case maybe they can patch the kernel to use pmtmr?).
