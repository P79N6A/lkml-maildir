Subject: [PATCH -mm] IrCOMM discovery indication simplification
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Andrew,
Every IrCOMM socket is registered with the discovery subsystem, so we don't
need to loop over all of them for every discovery event. We just need to
do it for the registered IrCOMM socket.
Would you please consider this patch for -mm inclusion ?
