"Just works" == emerge udev; rc-update add udev boot; reboot 
 -:)! Add "reading a big document" to that and it becomes "works after reading a document" ! 
Well, I had tried the gentoo udev guide, but landed in an non booting system - kernel couldn't mount /dev/hdaX since udev hadn't set it up by then. So I have to add devfs to command line. No offense to udev maintainer or the document writer - the problem might be unique to my setup.
Now going back to my original question - has anyone got an idea as to why pci_enable_device() could hang system for 2 minutes before recovering ;) ?!
