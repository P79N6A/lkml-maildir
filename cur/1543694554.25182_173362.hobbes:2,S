If we really believe copy_*_user() must correctly handle *all* faults,
isn't the "p >= __pa(high_memory)" test superfluous?
I don't know how ia32 handles a read to non-existent physical memory.
Are you saying that copy_*_user() can deal with that just like it does
a garden-variety TLB fault?
On ia64, a read to non-existent physical memory causes the processor
to time out and take a machine check.  I'm not sure it's even possible
to recover from that.
