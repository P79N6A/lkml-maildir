This is the only Promise Tech. device shown.
Here is the more detailed info about this, look at Region 1,
and compare the VIA IDE controller below:

Could it be that Region 1 of the Promise controller contains
the PATA I/O ports? Then it could be driven with a drivers/ide
driver... Maybe common locking is needed between sata_promise.c
and a driver for it's PATA side, I don't know.
Just an idea I am willing to test if Bartolomiej and You come
up with a solution. Nudge, nudge. :-)
