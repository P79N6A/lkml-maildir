Shell parseable /proc/* entries would be so much more elegant to deal with
compared to the old system. I would guess that maintainers for things like
KDE would jump at the opportunity to decrease the complexity of their
code.
A compatibility mode might be useful. Either a straight config option, or
perhaps something more sophisticated. Idea: perhaps proc functions
installed with create_proc_read_entry could, rather than just write
strings to buffers, return a list of key/value pairs which is rendered in
some configurable format by a new function, like "proc_render_values".
proc_render_values could use a column format like it does now, or a shell
parseable foo=blah\n format.
Or even XML. Ouch! No need to throw things at me!
Regards,
Luke.
