Yes. Thats also being presented at Usenix Security 2003:
     Remote Timing Attacks Are Practical
     David Brumley and Dan Boneh, Stanford University 
Available at:
     
http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/ssl-timing.pdf
However, that paper was dealing with public key operations, not
hash-collisions. Thus, the temporal dependence on the key, the 'hidden
channel' will probably be orders of magnitude smaller. At that, the
paper only works well on a local network, and the result of the attack
is far more interesting, the server's private key.
In *theory* such an attack is possible and could be used to determine
the secret key used in the Jenkin's hash in the networking stack,
dcache, or other places in the kernel. Assuming that collision versus
non-collision could be uniquely distinguished with $k$ trials, and the
hash table has $n$ buckets, the attack would require about 5*k*n or so
queries. The idea is to determine if inputs $i$ and $j$ collide. This
has a chance of $1/n$ of occuring. If I can uniquely distinguish this,
which requires $k$ trials. then on average after $k*n$ trials I'll
have one collision. I repeat this $32/log_2 (n)$, say, 5 times, and I
have 5 such pairs of known collisions $i,j$. I then enumerate all 2^32
keys, and see which one of them is consistent with the collision
evidence observed. This will usually result in only a few possible
keys.
All of this is in theory of course.  In practice, for the bits of the
kernel we're discussing, this sort of attack is completely irrelevant.
I also note that universal hashing is also not immune to these
attacks.  To defend, we'd have to go to cryptographic techniques.
