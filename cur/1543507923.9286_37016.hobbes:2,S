Don't know exactly when it started happening, but I think
it was around the time I upgraded to 2.2.1[01]. Recently
I've been getting a series of messages (which unfortunately
don't get logged, and get scrolled off screen pretty quick)
during boot up saying something to the effect that modprobe
can't find lo:1, lo:2, lo:3, ... lo:50 and the same series
of messages for eth0. While I don't think this is hurting
anything, I'm not sure where they're coming from and why,
and that's kind of annoying...
Any hints?
