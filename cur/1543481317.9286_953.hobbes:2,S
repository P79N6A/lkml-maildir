Ah, but this is now equivalent instead to
if (func1()&&func2()&&func3()&&func4())
	do_something();
else
	complain();
But of course, you're right, in the structured way it is too difficult
to code different cleanup depending on where I failed, while in the goto
case all the dirty stuff goes out of the normal flow.

valid point.

Here's what I got:
main:
	pushl %ebp
	movl %esp,%ebp
	pushl %ebx
	movl $9,%ebx
	.p2align 4,,7
.L5:
	pushl $.LC0		# this was the string
	call puts		# even inlines foo() for you :-)
	addl $4,%esp
	subl $1,%ebx		# mm.. ah! decl doesn't affect the flags
	jnc .L5
	movl -4(%ebp),%ebx
	movl %ebp,%esp
	popl %ebp
	ret
I think writing code cleanly has the advantage that you don't carry around
stuff that was optimized for the 386 because gcc 2.6 or whatever had a poor
optimizer even when current compilers can do a good job.
Besides, if the code was written by someone with x86 experience, it is possible
that a different version would actually be faster on a RISC architecture like
the sparc. Leaving decisions up to the compiler might be better, and should get
less costly as compilers get better.
