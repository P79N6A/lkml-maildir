Yes, it is a kernel feature, sort of. I think Linux always let you use
whatever charset you pleased, but sometime in 2.1 ISO 8859-15 support
was added for FAT filesystems (and Joliet). So the added support is only
relevent for people using Microsoft filesystems.
(I think; haven't checked just when it was added.)
