I didn't try --directisa, but I did remove /dev/rtc, which, according
to hwclock's manpage should have the same effect.
Afterwards hwclock does work well. 
But I have a correction: The problem does not only occurr if the system
was started automatically by the bios, a manual 'soft off/soft on' sequence
shows the same effect. Only 'hard off/hard on' (using the switch directly 
on the power supply) seems to work every time.
