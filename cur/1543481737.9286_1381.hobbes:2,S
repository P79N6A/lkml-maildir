Well, I'd say just to get it to them as quickly as possible.  I wouldn't trust news
organizations not to use a release before its "for release" date, so I'd wait until
the official go-ahead from Linus.
Nonetheless, it's not clear that all of these web mags have even unofficial Linux
contacts.  They probably all have "contact us" type links, though I'm not sure how
often they actually read it. =)  It would be best if people would volunteer *now*
for particular sites if they know someone on the inside who can direct it to the
proper place; we can divide up the other sites later, if no one volunteers.
For now, let's get a proper list of sites.  The sooner we start thinking about this,
the less of a chance we will miss one.  For the United States (which is the only
area I'm even moderately qualified to list), here's what I have so far:
Mainstream news
--
AP
CNN
ABC News
MSNBC (yukk)
USA Today
NY Times
WSJ
Washington Post
Boston Globe
LA Times
Mainstream computer news
--
ZDNet
CNET News (news.com)
TechWeb
Wired
Linux news
--
Slashdot (well, geek news)
LWN
Linux Resources (LJ)
LinuxWorld
Linux Mall (they have news)
Newsgroups
--
c.o.l.a
I'm missing a lot, so augment this list with whatever comes to mind.  (These are
just the sites and papers that I tend to frequently read.)

Excellent idea.
Does anyone know if one of the good Linux sites (i.e., not linux.org) has a listserv
that they'd be willing to let us use?  I'd be happy to set up a server on my
machine, but "linux@bigred.lcs.mit.edu" doesn't really sound terribly official, and
I don't know how forwarding behaves with listservs.  I'll try it out later and see
if it works.
