Anyway i chatted around the globus and someone also mentioned that my 
IRQs for sound and several others are very high. I'm not sure if this is 
a board issue or a kernel issue. But since the sound chip on board (hda 
intel) is having problems too I guess it's a kernel related thing. I 
wonder if this will be fixed in newer versions.
