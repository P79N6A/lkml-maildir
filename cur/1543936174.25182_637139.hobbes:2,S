thanks, applied.
since these printouts are only useful if we have early-printk 
capabilities enabled, i made it dependent on CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK.
I also made EARLY_PRINTK selectable on 64-bit as well. (for some unknown 
reason it was unconditionally built into 64-bit (unlike 32-bit where it 
is selectable on EMBEDDED))
