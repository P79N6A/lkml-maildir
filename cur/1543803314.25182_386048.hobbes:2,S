OK, I'll send a patch for that this weekend.  It should be:
  lockd.nlm_udpport=N  lockd.nlm_tcpport=M
when built into the kernel
image.  If built as loadable modules, it is just
  modprobe lockd nlm_udpport=N nlm_tcpport=M

No idea.

If above doesn't work, it would be much better if you filed a bug on it.
