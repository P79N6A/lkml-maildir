Using colon-separated suffixes seems like a reasonable solution IMO.

Colons. I haven't seen any holes in that yet ;-)
Like the HFS approach, you can tar up an NTFS partition (with
multi-streamed files), unpack it to ext2 or whatever, tar it up again,
unpack to NTFS and you are left with exactly what you started.
It avoids breaking existing userspace tools (tar, cp etc).
It even makes porting things from NT easier - they see the extra streams
the same way they expect to.
Anyone got any objections to this??
James.
