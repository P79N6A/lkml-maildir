I don't think any OS supports exception handling in a driver.  It wouldn't make
much sense, since there's no way for a driver to really "exit" (which is the
ultimate destination of the exception).
By the way, new and delete are NOT exceptions.  They are simply wrappers for
malloc() and free().  Just define your own malloc and free (they can be
wrappers for a kernel memory allocation API, or you can write your own heap
manager), and new and delete work just fine.
