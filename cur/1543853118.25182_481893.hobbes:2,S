Please note that the sg interface is depreciated.  It is now recommended 
that you send the CCBs directly to the normal device, i.e. /dev/hdc.

I'm not sure what you mean by "on some big files" as the sg interface 
has no notion of files; you're just reading the disk sector by sector, 
as you said earlier.  Also by fail do you mean that the request returns 
an error status?  If so then the read buffer will not be valid.
