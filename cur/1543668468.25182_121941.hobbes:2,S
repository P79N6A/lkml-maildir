Hi Chas,
thanks for having taken the job of cleaning this up!!!
I've merged your 2.4 patch w/ my changes and check w/ a couple of thousand PPPoA
sessions created and destroyed over night (which always triggered the
locking/unlocking vcc problems on my SMP box).
I'll let you know how it goes by tomorrow.
One comment on the patch - the change in the net/atm/Makefile (i.e. changing
O_TARGET into atmdev.o) didn't work in my environment (main Makefile still links
atm.o), but I haven't had time to check it out any further - I am using the old
Makefile for now.
Thanks again - and yes, I am using the he155 card :-)
Immanuel
