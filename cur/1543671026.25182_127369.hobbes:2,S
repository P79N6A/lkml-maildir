No.
I believe he is saying that ever since 1984 and the Mac Plus, it has 
been expected that sound works right away without adding any lines anywhere.
I have not seen a computer in the last year and a half that has not had 
either onboard sound or a card. It is very standard hardware these days. 
Therefore, your soundcard should work just like your keyboard does. You 
do not have to add any lines to any rc script to get the keyboard 
working, do you? Sound should not have to be any different, in an ideal 
world.
