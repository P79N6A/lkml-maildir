The harm is slower kmem_cache_free and a lower hit ratio for the per-cpu 
caches: kmem_cache_free must identify and return wrong node objects, and 
due to these returns, the per-cpu array is more often empty in 
kmem_cache_alloc.
IIRC someone from SGI wrote that they have seen bad performance in 
fork-bomb tests on large cpu count systems which might be caused by 
inter-node traffic on the mm_struct structure and that they think that a 
numa aware allocator would help. As far as I know no tests were done to 
very that assumption.
