As soon as you want to synchronize and merge two trees, you will know why 
this information does matter.
(/me looks closer at the sparse-conversion...)
It seems you exported the complete parent information and this is exactly 
the "nitty-gritty" I was "whining" about and which is not available via 
bkcvs or bkweb and it's the most crucial information to make the bk data 
useful outside of bk. Larry was previously very clear about this that he 
considers this proprietary bk meta data and anyone attempting to export 
this information is in violation with the free bk licence, so you indeed 
just took the important parts and this is/was explicitly verboten for 
normal bk users.
bye, Roman
