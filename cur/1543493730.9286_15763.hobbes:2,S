Yes. It also uses it to synchronize various other write events, like the
per-page write queue etc.
Once that synchronization has been done, the thing is released: even
though there is a pending write. It's only a "data coherency lock", it's
not necessarily a "IO is pending on this" (you could use it for IO pending
too, but that would serialize everything: releasing the lock means that
you can gather up multiple write requests up until the time you decide to
actually physically push it out the door).

I thought I fixed that once already. Oh, well. Minor annoyance and
potentially a small performance hit (but it shouldn't really be a big
deal).

No, you're right. I know I looked at fixing it, but I obviously never
actually did. This was when I wanted to get 2.2 out.
