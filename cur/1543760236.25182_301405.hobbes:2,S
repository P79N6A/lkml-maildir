That could work, assuming that:
a) the helper can always finish unpacking the image before 
   change_console releases the semaphore
b) the console is not redrawn at one point before change_console is 
   finished (I'm sorry, I don't have time to check that right now)
If one of this assumptions is wrong, we would end up with first 
displaying the wrong background picture and then quickly painting
the new one (I doubt this would make a good impression on the user..).

Agreed, that might not be the nicest thing to do, but it just seems
there isn't much of a choice in this situation.
I'm going to be away for the next 10 days or so. When I get back I'll
start testing some of the proposed changes. Maybe by using things like
firmware_request it would at least be possible to make the splash
interface a little simpler.
Live long and prosper.
