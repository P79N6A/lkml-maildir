Nope, there is precious little doc about modules, especially
in 2.6.
There is a FAQ, but I doubt that it answers many of your
questions.

You could try LDD3, but I don't see much there that would help
you either.

No, no syscall to do that.  Looks like it will require reading
and parsing files.
And you answered my "what" question clearly, so I have one more.
Why?  for what purpose, to what end?  What are you tring to
accomplish?
