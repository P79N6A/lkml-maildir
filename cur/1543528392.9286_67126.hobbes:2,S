SUBTERFUGUE 0.1.0, which has minor changes from 0.0, is available.
From NEWS:
Version 0.1.0 ("somewhere")
* Optimization (for speed) of process following.  (Following 'emacs -nw' with
  no tricks, for example, is now about 30-40% faster.)
* Improved path canonicalization, from a suggestion by Pavel Kankovsky.
* Bug fixes.
==============================================================================
This is SUBTERFUGUE.  See 'NEWS' for info on the latest release.
SUBTERFUGUE is a framework for observing and playing with the reality of
software; it's a foundation for building tools to do tracing, sandboxing, and
many other things. You could think of it as "strace meets expect."
Here's a short (real) "screenshot" which hints at one of its possible uses:
    # sf --trick=SimplePathSandbox:"read=['/'];write=['/dev/tty'];net=1" bash
    # id
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
    # rm -f /etc/passwd
    write deny (unlink): '/etc/passwd'
    rm: cannot unlink `/etc/passwd': Permission denied
BEWARE: This is an alpha release.  It might not hose your system, but who can
say?  You probably shouldn't even be reading this.  Don't run this as root,
except on a scratch system.  Don't use it to run programs where a loss of
state might be disastrous (e.g., fetchmail).  Consider yourself warned.
