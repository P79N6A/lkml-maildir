I am encountering the same results on the same m/b.  I also am running 2
processors, SMP kernel.
I have 2 WDAC29100, one as hde, one as hdg.
If I use hde as root, it hangs only rarely.
I noticed most hangs(nearly every time) when copying large amounts of data (dd)
from hda to hd[eg].
this was using the 2.3.[12,13] and the backport to 2.2 series patches.
Sorry it's not too scientific, I can perform other (better) experiments if
needed.
