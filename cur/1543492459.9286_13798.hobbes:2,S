Greetings,
I'm writing a module which starts a kernel thread at insmod time.  I have
run into two problems.  The first is that my thread is a child of insmod
unless I start it from outside process context.  Currently I work around
that by launching it from a kernel timer which expires momentarily after
insmod.  The other problem is that when my thread functions exits, it
becomes a zombie.  Is there a way for me to cleanly remove the thread at
rmmod time when it is finished doing it's work?
thanks,
-bp
