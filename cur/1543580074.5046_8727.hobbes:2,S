Hi,
i am just working on a different arch (mips board) and try to initialize
the serial console from the arch specific setup with
setup_console("ttyS0,57600") which doesnt work it seems as
serial_console_setup is itself "__init" and has a default of 9k6.
So how do i init the serial console from the arch specific stuff with
something else than the default baud rate ?
Flo

     Why is it called "common sense" when nobody seems to have any?
