Heh...maybe include/linux/bio.h? :)
Now that you've pointed out this stack vs. fifo problem a couple times, I'm 
beginning to wonder why the bi_next field in the bio is a struct bio * 
instead of a struct list_head. It would seem that changing it to a list_head 
would eliminate the need for the bio_list stuff, as well as eliminate the 
original problem of accidentally reordering the bio's.
Of course, it's probably way to late to make this kind of change, since it 
would involve auditing every driver that ever holds a pointer to a bio to see 
if it's treating that pointer as the head of a list.
