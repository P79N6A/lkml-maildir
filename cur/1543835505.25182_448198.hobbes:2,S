It's just as likely that their lawyers would tell them that they would
have to pretend that the modifications don't exist at all, and not
release any changes for any driver (like OpenBSD's) that bypassed the
regulatory daemon.  The bigger worry would be if they decided that
they couldn't risk supporting their current out-of-tree driver, and
couldn't release Linux drivers for their softmac wireless devices in
the future.
Personally, I don't see why the requirement of an external daemon is
really considered that evil.  We allow drivers that depend on firmware
loaders, don't we?  I could imagine a device that required a digitally
signed message (using RSA) with a challenge/response protocol embedded
inside that was necessary to configure said device, which is
calculated in userspace and then passed down into the kernel to be
installed into the device so that it could function.  Do we really
want to consider that to be objectionable?
