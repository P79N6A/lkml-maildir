You would also find "oops" messages in the system log.

pgcc is a fairly experimental compiler. We know in places it doesnt build the
kernel correctly. Not always because of the compiler but sometimes because the
kernel doesnt expect that kind of optimisation.

I would like to know if the standard 2.2.12/13 or 14pre (either will do here)
kernels built with gcc/egcs and not pgcc also show the problem. Something
very odd is going on if your rollbacks fail. I'd like to know what even
if Oracle dont.
