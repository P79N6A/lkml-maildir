Hi Everybody
I downloaded this stuff, merged it in and tried it.  Everything worked
fine except the serial console connections are not showing the
bootloader information that was introduced with Cort's serial
console changes.  I don't yet know why as I am suddenly swamped
with work but I will track it down in the next few days if nobody else
does.  Othwise this looks really great.
I really like the configuration changes Gary mode for the command
line stuff and being able to configure the mouse to force initialization.
