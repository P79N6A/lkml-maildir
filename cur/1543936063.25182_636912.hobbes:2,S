Excellent! I am definitely on board with this.

Hmmm... a 3 level allocator? Basically we would have BASE_PAGE 
STANDARD_PAGE and HUGE_PAGE? We could simply extend the page allocator to 
have 3 pcp lists for these sizes and go from there?
Thinking about the arches this would mean
	BASE_PAGE	STANDARD_PAGE	HUGE_PAGE
x86_64	4k		64k		2M
i386	4k		16k		4M
ia64	16k		256k		1G
