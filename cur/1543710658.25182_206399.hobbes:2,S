I'm not arguing about a personal, stylistic preference-- these differing types
have been provided for a reason and the ethtool header file should comply with
the stated and idiomatic usage within the kernel sources, as do other such
header files.
Without such a change, userspace applications cannot use the ethtool ioctl
interface without completely unnecessary gyrations.  I truly appreciate your
preference, but this has nothing to do with style.
