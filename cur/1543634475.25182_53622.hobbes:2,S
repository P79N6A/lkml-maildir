Yes that would be best / modulo possible name space clashes.
The names in scsi/scsi.h look too generic sometimes. Like:
#define TYPE_DISK           0x00
#define TYPE_TAPE           0x01
#define TYPE_PRINTER        0x02
#define TYPE_PROCESSOR      0x03    /* HP scanners use this */
#define TYPE_WORM           0x04    /* Treated as ROM by our system */
#define TYPE_ROM            0x05
or
/*
  *  Status codes
  */
#define GOOD                 0x00
#define BUSY                 0x04
