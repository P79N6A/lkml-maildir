Hello All,
This question might sound dumb for many, and to some annoying too ;-)
Am enterting into -rc Kernel (testing & analysis) & involvement with
the kernel (contributing to patches). I have this doubt. I did refer
to applying-patches in the kernel documentation, this is what I got:-
> These are the base stable releases released by Linus. The highest numbered
> release is the most recent.
> If regressions or other serious flaws are found, then a -stable fix patch
> will be released (see below) on top of this base. Once a new 2.6.x base
> kernel is released, a patch is made available that is a delta between the
> previous 2.6.x kernel and the new one.
> To apply a patch moving from 2.6.11 to 2.6.12, you'd do the following (note
> that such patches do *NOT* apply on top of 2.6.x.y kernels but on top of the
> base 2.6.x kernel -- if you need to move from 2.6.x.y to 2.6.x+1 you need to
> first revert the 2.6.x.y patch).
I did understand till here. Should I start compile/test/debug
one-after-one in this fashion:-
2.6.19 source + patch-2.6.20-rc1
2.6.19 source + patch-2.6.20-rc2
2.6.19 source + patch-2.6.20-rc3
2.6.19 source + patch-2.6.20-rc4
OR
Pick the latest release number?
Note:
Am working for different requirements in the Labs with Linux
(Telecom/Embedded). This activity starting as an independant activity
in my home/sometimes in Labs. So, I wanted to jump into kernel
development (mainly as compile/test/debug/patch). Hope I get enough
encouragement ;-)
