It was a cleaning agent advertised all over eastern Europe between abt. 1991
and 1994 IIRC. If you're _truly_ after the history of Linux, you might like
to get hold of a copy of Karel Kachyna's movie "Fany" [1], in which you can
see most of this spectacular piece of a generic cleaning agent commercial. :)
Let me add, though, this movie has got some *real* qualities too.
