Perhaps, but almost all the byteswap is performed on the metadata side, 
reading directories and inodes, where nearly every byte will need to be 
swapped.  As inodes are compacted and compressed in 8 KB blocks, and are 
on average 15 bytes in size, for each 8 KB decompress you're potentially 
doing 8192/15 inode byteswaps.  This is probably sufficent to affect 
directory search and lookup on a slow processor.
The data path is all gzip overhead (64K datablocks), there is no 
byteswap taking place except for the block size integer.  Therefore 
byteswap doesn't have any affect on reading data.
