Hi,
I would like to create a log file containing the reads and writes made on a disk, by adding a function in the kernel. And once this log table reaches a limit, say 10,000 records, I would like it to be written on hard disk automatically. I am unable to do this, since I dont know how to write to a file, while in the kernel. I tried System Calls, but they dont seem to work. Could someone tell me what is the list of functions that I need to use to do this job. I think I have to play with super-blocks and inodes. But I dont know how to do that. :) Please help me.
Thanks.
Sumit
p.s. I am using Kernel 2.4.20 and want this in EXT2 FS
