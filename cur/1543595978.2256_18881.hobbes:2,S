Hi, I am not subscribed to the list.  Please CC me on replies.
The VIA686B SouthBridge bug workaround is not activated on motherboards
which have a VIA 82C686B that needs fixing, but not a VIA NorthBridge.  For
example, my Asus A7M266 has an AMD 761 NorthBridge, and the table at the end
of linux/drivers/pci/quirks.c thus does not attempt to apply the fix.
Someone suggested a fix against 2.4.4 in this thread, however it has not all
been fixed on 2.4.5 nor 2.4.5-ac22 (current, I believe).
Below is a patch to the __initdata table which causes the fix to be applied
based on detection of the buggy SouthBridge, and *not* the NorthBridge which
is commonly used with it.  This is the correct behavior, and was suggested
by someone during the thread I reference, however this aspect of the fix was
overlooked.
