Ok, you can ignore this; I believe the original advisory is bogus.
prepare_binprm ensures a 128 byte buffer that kernel_read data is copied
to; in case something smaller is copied in, the rest of the space is
zero'd out.  Thus, <128 reads are fine, and in many cases (as in
binfmt_script w/ tiny scripts less than 128 bytes in total) perfectly
valid.
