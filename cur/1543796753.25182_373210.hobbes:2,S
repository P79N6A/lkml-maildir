As far as the core VM is concerned, these pages are really "dirty", only it
happens to be a different flavour of dirtiness.  So perhaps we should
continue to mark these pages as dirty and let NFS internally take care
of which end of the wire they're dirty at.
Presumably calling writepage() a second time won't be very useful.  Or will
it?  Perhaps when NFS sees writepage against a PageDirty && PageUnstable
page it can recognise that as a hint to kick off a server-side write.

You can use (GFP_ATOMIC & !__GFP_HIGH) to avoid draining emergency pools.
