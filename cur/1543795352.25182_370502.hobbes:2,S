At least the Lindenhurst (E7205) datasheet says the chipset can trigger
MCEs in the CPU (using a MCEERR# pin). I don't know if it's always
enabled, but the hardware seems to have the capability.
That's the oldest Intel server chipset supported with EM64T CPUs.
The threshold counters are not supported directly only.

That would be nice to have agreed. But I don't really know
how to do this without mainboard specific knowledge.
If you have something usable it's best to port it to mce.c
or perhaps mcelog

There is a clear case for being architecture specific here. Some 
architectures - like PPC64 or IA64 - have good firmware support for it, so it's
best to use these facilities. On others like i386 and
x86-64 the x86-64 log architecture is good. I might be a bit
biased but I think it's very good and should be used on i386
at some point too. I don't see any need for more.
