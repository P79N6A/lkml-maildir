The Mutex ownership change seems to climb with waiting threads.
Its hard to tell with the log-n X-axis scale, but does this possibly
correlate to the deadlock-detect option?
If Deadlock-detect is enabled we should be seeing a graph proportional
to n-squared on a linear X axis.
If deadlock detect is disabled, the wait time should plateau for very
large N.
