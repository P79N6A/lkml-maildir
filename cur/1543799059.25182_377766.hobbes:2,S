The sets are incomparable.
Intel P5 up to P4/Xeon/EM64T, though not P4's PEBS.
AMD K7 and K8.
X86 clones with performance counters (VIA C3 and Cyrix' P5-clones).
Any x86 with TSC. (Still useful for accurate time measurements.)
PPC32 (604 up to 74xx).
Any PPC32 with TB. (Still useful for accurate time measurements.)
POWER4/G5/POWER5 (done by David Gibson not me).
Preliminary ARM/XScale support is working but stalled due to
more pressing commitments and unresolved ARM platform issues.
(Some XScale/PXA drivers clobber the PMU registers for no good reason.)
UltraSPARC would be trivial to support, except (1) I don't have one,
and (2) they already have a primitive pre-historic perfctr facility.
