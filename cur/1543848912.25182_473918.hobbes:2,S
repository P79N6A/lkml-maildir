Mm, I did not test, I did only check the source and it seems that I did 
interpret the check 
        len += offsetof(struct rock_ridge, u); 
        if (len > rs->len) { 
                printk(KERN_NOTICE "rock: directory entry would overflow " 
                                "storage\n"); 
                printk(KERN_NOTICE "rock: sig=0x%02x, size=%d, remaining=%d\n", 
                                sig, len, rs->len); 
                return -EIO; 
	}
the wrong way.... because the error text is wrong. It should be corrected into
"rock: directory entry would _underflow_ storage\n"
Using the inode field from RRip 1.12 is definitely not trivial as it may affect
many parts of the source and needs intensive testing.
