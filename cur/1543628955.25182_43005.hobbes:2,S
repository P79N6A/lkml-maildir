Unfortunatelly (at least for the C1VM windows XP bios) it 
requires windows installed, so it could launch a fancy graphical
installer, which will test if your laptop is the correct version and 
if it is, it will create the dos boot disk.
Of course it didn't work for me (since I have a C1VE, which is the
european version of the C1VM, and the bios wasn't "certified" for
my version). But I was able to workaround by manually looking at
the temporary files (windows\temp directory) while the fancy setup
utility was running....
Just in case it's useful...
