Some ideas:
1. use this to express the existing showexec option
2. make this work for all non-UNIX filesystems
3. specify the data some other place
While you're hacking around FAT stuff, see about
using the timestamp of the volume name file for
the root directory. Remember that very old
filesystems won't have a volume name file, so
you might need to create one.
Also I found a bug in the vfat code. It doesn't
properly handle old (pre-vfat) files with names
that start with 0xE5; these are stored on disk
with 0x05 as the first character.
