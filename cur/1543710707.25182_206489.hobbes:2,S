Hi list,
I noticed that patching the 2.6.4 kernel sources with the mm2 patch 
actually deletes scripts/fixdep.c, which results in a compilation error 
when building the bzImage.
I wouldn't be able to fix this though ...
TY
PS : This is my first post, so I don't know whether this is relevant, 
please excuse me if it's not. (and Yes I read the FAQ before posting 
this ;o)
