you are correct.. i am a newbie.. my debug is set to the default (1)i
didnt see that last vortex_debug..
the machine i have this nic on visits several networks.. as this code
suggests, maybe this is a more serious error than i thought. this machine
has been tested in several networks, and seems to be happening everywhere
for me.
can you guys give me any clues to finding the culprit on the
network? the condition is easily created for me..
thanks for your help
