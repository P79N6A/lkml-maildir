If it doesn't need it then sure, otherwise just dump whatever
it needs in there. The seperate files would still be there too.

I *have* the big iron with tons of processes ;-) That's why
I care ...

Well if we want to be gross and efficient, we could just compile
a kmem-diving dynamic library with every kernel compile and stick
it in /boot or somewhere. Mildly less extreme is a flat index file
for the data you need a la System.map. Then just open /dev/kmem
and grab what you want. Walking the tasklist with no locking would
be an interesting challenge, but probably not insurmountable. 
That's how things like ps always used to work IIRC.
