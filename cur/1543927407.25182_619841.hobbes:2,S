It seems that you're doing the same thing in both cases, except you're 
now extending it to include other random functionality, which means 
other things than syslets are suddenly affected.
syslets are arguably a little bit different, since what you're 
effectively doing there is running a miniature interpreted language in 
kernel space.  A higher startup overhead should be acceptable, since 
you're amortizing it over a larger number of calls.  Extending that 
mechanism suddenly means you HAVE to use that interpreted language 
message mechanism to access certain system calls, which really does not 
seem like a good thing neither for performance nor for encouraging sane 
design of interfaces.
Everyone who designs a multiplexer have good reasons for the expediency 
that it provides, but it really isn't a good thing in the long term. 
The reason I mentioned MS-DOS is that MS-DOS has tons of multiplexers, 
sometimes three levels deep.  Furthermore, it doesn't have any kind of 
uniformity to its system calls calling convention.  The end result is 
hand-crafted stubs and wrappers, on both sides of the interface.
