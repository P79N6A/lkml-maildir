Is it normal for a system to lockup while creating a 3GB test file?
Following command: dd if=/dev/zero of=file bs=1M count=3000
The system freezes up for 30-60 seconds for as many as 3-4 times during
the creation of the file.
Is this normal?
Anyway to tweak the /proc settings to avoid system freezing?
