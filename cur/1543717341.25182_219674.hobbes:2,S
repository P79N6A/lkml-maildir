Thanks for fixing this the right way.  I'll try it out in the next couple
days.  Nice coincidence that all the sched-domains stuff went in the
same day :-)

I'm sure my patch wasn't complete, but it did address something
that still looks strange to me.  The current code is:
	void __init init_idle(task_t *idle, int cpu)
	{
	        runqueue_t *idle_rq = cpu_rq(cpu), *rq = cpu_rq(task_cpu(idle));
	        unsigned long flags;
	        local_irq_save(flags);
	        double_rq_lock(idle_rq, rq);
	        idle_rq->curr = idle_rq->idle = idle;
The fact that we look up the runqueue, lock it, and use it without
rechecking that we got the correct one certainly is suspicious at
the micro point of view.
But, if you say this window is not a problem anymore because of the
larger design, I'll take your word for it.
