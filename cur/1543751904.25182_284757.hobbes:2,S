And what 3rd party hardware vendor wants to waste their resources by
repeting smaller versions of the one-time cost of driver writing over
and over to accomodate linux, when they can't even accomodate all
versions due to special patches some people have?  So far there's been a
rediculous but visible trend of hardware vendors to hold their source
closed.  Why not just chase the easier targets like Windows and MacOS?
I want Linux to be a popular OS.  Linus I wouldn't be surprised if he
doesn't care, because Linux isn't a business (though some businesses are
for all intents and purposes basically Linux), so this is pretty much a
moot point to be arguing.  Anything having to do with the marketability
of Linux is pretty much not worth arguing; genuine quality in the open
source community tends to be, though only if it encompasses only
contributions from the open source community.
I guess this isn't worth bothering to argue anymore.
