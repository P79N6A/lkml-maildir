So far, 2.6.9-rc1-bk10 works (X starts without hang, log indicates drm 
works too).
2.6.9-rc1-bk15 started X without a hang, but failed drm according to the 
log:
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] created "radeon" driver at busid "PCI:0:8:0"
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] added 8192 byte SAREA at 0xe0932000
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] mapped SAREA 0xe0932000 to 0xafd8d000
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] framebuffer handle = 0xe0000000
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] added 1 reserved context for kernel
(EE) RADEON(0): [pci] Out of memory (-1007)
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] removed 1 reserved context for kernel

A normal lok (bk10) looks like this:

(II) RADEON(0): Using 5 MB for GART textures
(II) RADEON(0): Memory manager initialized to (0,0) (1280,8191)
What is the most useful to do now?
Binary searching for the crash between bk15 and rc2?   Or:
Binary searching for the "out of memory" between bk10 and bk15?
