I will agree with that, at least conditionally.  
I figure stop_apics can be removed from the panic path.
However stopping all of the cpus does seem to be something
that is needed on the panic path.  And if we stop cpus
what is wrong with cpu migration.  Or can we move the halt
of the cpus into the panic kernel?  That would be my real 
preference.

50%.  The normal case needs to shutdown the way it is currently doing.
So we need to audit the code a little more.
Basically the way I see it, in the normal case the kernel is responsible
for a clean shutdown of the kernel and all it's devices.   No one else
knows better how to accomplish those tasks then the drivers running the kernel.
On the other hand during a panic the recovery kernel is responsible for
everything it possibly can handle.  Because we know something is broken
in the kernel calling kexec.
