Subject: [0/4] better i386 CPU selection
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/1/9/232

The patches below are:
[1/4]
- changed the i386 CPU selection from a choice to single options for
  every cpu
- renamed the M* variables to CPU_*, this is needed to ask the users
  upgrading from older kernels instead of silently changing the
  semantics
- X86_GOOD_APIC -> X86_BAD_APIC
- AMD Elan is a different subarch, you can't configure a kernel that
  runs on both the AMD Elan and other i386 CPUs
- added optimizing CFLAGS for the AMD Elan
- gcc 2.95 supports -march=k6 (no need for check_gcc)
- help text changes/updates
[2/4]
move "struct movsl_mask movsl_mask" to usercopy.c 
(CONFIG_X86_INTEL_USERCOPY is used on non-Intel CPUs)
[3/4]
- made arch/i386/kernel/cpu/Makefile CPU specific
[4/4]
- made arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/Makefile CPU specific
Dependencies between these patches:
- patch 3 requires 1+2
- patch 4 requires 1
The main part is patch 1.
Patch 2 fixes a small issue that only shows up with patch 3.
Patches 3+4 are proof of concept patches for space optimizations by 
omitting unneeded code. They are "proof of concept" since the #ifdef's 
they introduce aren't 
TODO:
- change include/asm-i386/module.h to use some kind of bitmask
I've updated the patches for 2.6.1-rc3 and a kernel with these patches 
applied compiles and runs for me.
