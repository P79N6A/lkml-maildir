Someone emailed me the bug report for gcc:
 
http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5035
And in this, it showed the trick to initialize self to turn off that
warning.
Would it be OK to define a macro like:
#ifdef CONFIG_SHOW_ALL_UNINIT_WARNINGS
#  define init_self(x) x
#else
#  define init_self(x) x = x
#endif
Such that we can at least look at the places of bogus uninitialized
warnings and do something like:
Index: ipc/sem.c

        struct kern_ipc_perm *ipcp;
        if(cmd == IPC_SET) {
Seems to work.  And if you want to make sure that a place doesn't need it
anymore, use -Winit-self and have a script to do a full make once with
CONFIG_SHOW_ALL_UNINIT_WARNINGS and once with -Winit-self, and make sure
that all the -Winit-self warnings are in the
CONFIG_SHOW_ALL_UNINIT_WARNINGS. Otherwise the init_self isn't needed
anymore.
