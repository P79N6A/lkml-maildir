	The usual way to deal with this is to have a 'clock watcher' thread. If the 
system time jumps any significant amount, you signal all condition variables. 
You're not guaranteed any particular latency anyway.
	I don't think a DVD playback skipping when the system time is changed by a 
large amount is unacceptable. However, the use of some sort of linear 
timebase is much more convenient for many things.
