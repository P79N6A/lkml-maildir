Hi,
I installed both Windows 2000 and RedHat Linux 7.2 onto my Dell Inspiron
2100 laptop. The sound card is  Cirrus Logic Crystal CS4281 PCI Audio. It
works fine under W2k, also fine under Linux if the laptop boots directly
into Linux. But there is a weird problem: if I reboot the computer from W2k
into Linux, it is unable to load the sound driver.
Do you have any idea what may cause this weird behavior? Or can you send me
the latest driver? If you need more detailed information, please let me
know.
Thanks and best wishes,
Shaw
