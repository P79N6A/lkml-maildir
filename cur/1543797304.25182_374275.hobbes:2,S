I am attempting to write a low-latency logger.  'Low' meaning a system call is too slow (measured
at 0.3 microseconds) for each message.  So I am trying to use the page cache to handle the
background scheduling of bulk writes to the server, and as an extra layer of reliability in the
event of a program crash.  The use of pwrite seems to be the best option at this time as spending
a few milliseconds for an ftruncate to a show-stopper.
I could also just write locally into a shared memory region, and have my own background copy to
the server, but this seems a bit wasteful when the page cache does most of this already, and can
optimize page-sized writes.
