Interesting. The ACPI spec claims that it should just be ignored by the 
OS.

Yes, I sent entirely the wrong one. Try this.
Some VIA southbridges contain a flag in the ACPI register space that 
indicates whether an abnormal poweroff has occured, presumably with the 
intention that it can be cleared on clean shutdown. Some BIOSes check 
this and will fail to resume if it's set. Clear it on boot in order to 
prevent this.
