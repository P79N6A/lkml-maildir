even generic x86 SMP boxes benefit from irqbalance due to better irq
affinity. Actually one could hardly find a worse way to distribute
interrupts than the IO-APIC + lowest priority delivery mode does... [in
fact there is one, the P4's do it ;-) ]

irqbalance uses the set_ioapic_affinity() method to set affinity. The
clustered APIC code is broken if it doesnt handle this properly. (i dont
have such hardware so i cant tell, but it indeed doesnt appear to handle
this case properly.) By wrapping around at node boundary the irqbalance
code will work just fine.

i agree that this could be a problem, but set_ioapic_affinity() can be
made dependent on the actual NUMA setup that is used. This is absolutely
needed anyway for a proper /proc/irq/*/smp_affinity feature.
