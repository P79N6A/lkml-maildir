Slightly OT:
Note that the "author" info is only semi readable from CVS. It contains 
just the user part of the email address (in my case - "lkml" for spam 
reasons - hardly a unique identifier). I'm told that under BK it has the 
full email, so I'm not sure where that stands there.
This does mean that under CVS, this info is not searchable, nor even 
guarenteed unique.
