No.  But anything in a removable device neets to be either remounted
read-only or unmounted if that is at all possible, because the user could
unplug it.  It is of course, sync'd anyway, so if the remount/umount fails,
no corruption should happen...  but the fs will be dirty, etc.
It can get very ugly when you factor in docks and removable bays. It's not
just USB/firewire mass-storage devices and memory cards.  And there is the
patological cases where the user suspends with the device in one port, and
resumes with the device in another port.
I feel userspace *can* do all that needs to be done, but we are (currently)
very bad at it.
