Well, what about this:
  stage 1 = LILO boot sector
  stage 2 = LILO's second stage
  stage 3 = Linux kernel, with a little initrd, etc.
  stage 4 = a script or such that handles user interaction, picks the
	    desired file, etc.
  stage 5 = the kernel that you actually wanted

It can - it's just that explicit support for file systems was a non-goal
(or, should I say "anti-goal") for LILO. Things like GRUB can probably
do what you want. There's of course a catch: LILO works with pretty much
any "traditional" file system (and this is the whole point of LILO - all
the rest are just convenience add-ons), while the filesystem-aware boot
loaders need updating for every new file system.
(I call a "traditional" file system one where constant data remains at
a fixed location, and where data is block-structured. Files on file
systems with sub-block allocations (e.g. reiserfs "tails") can in some
cases also be forced to be block-structured. It would also be possible
to extend LILO to handle allocations smaller than one sector.)
That's also the reason why I've written bootimg: to handle on-disk
structures (e.g. RAID, jfs) or other load sources (e.g. TFTP, or, for
a slightly more extreme scenario, Coda over an encrypted IPv6 tunnel
using PPPoverATM) which exceed what boot loaders can be expected to
handle.
The only program that is always able to access everything a Linux
kernel can access is ... a Linux kernel ;-) This makes it the ideal
n-th stage boot loader. (Except, of course, if storage space if very
tight. But then you can probably sacrifice some of the functionality.)
Note: that "intermediate" Linux kernel doesn't need to have every
single bell and whistle enabled. Also, you will probably upgrade it
only as frequently as, say, LILO, and not as frequently as regular
kernels.
