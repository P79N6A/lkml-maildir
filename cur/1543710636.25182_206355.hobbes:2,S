I may indeed be completely dense.  That's not unheard of around these
parts.  I'd certainly accept an explanation of my denseness in lieue of
any other explanation, as long as I can make this stop happening.
What is the nature of the auto-rule adding setups going berzerk problem?
Below are my current iptables rules on 'sam' (the only machine not
currently running 2.4.20).  There are no jumps to user defined chains.
I have not installed any scripts that dynamically add/alter iptables
rules.  I can't imagine what package I may have installed that might do
such a thing either.  Even if there were such a script somehow, since
nothing below ever jumps anywhere else, it wouldn't be getting called,
right?
If I flush and expunge my rules as follows, the problem goes away.  If
this was because a jump to user defined chain was being deleted, then I'd
understand.  But there are no jumps out of INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD,
PREROUTING, or POSTROUTING, so I'm confused.
$IPTABLES -F
$IPTABLES -t nat -F
$IPTABLES -X
$IPTABLES -P INPUT ACCEPT
$IPTABLES -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
$IPTABLES -P FORWARD ACCEPT
FWIW, I compiled the latest 'iptables' code against my current running
2.4.21 kernel also..
1052# iptables -V
iptables v1.2.9
1045# iptables -L
