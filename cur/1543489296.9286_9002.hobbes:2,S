Depends on your view (I though of motheboard connector as first). 
Try plugging it in the middle..

mc is just a program. It should not affect the hardware so much as to
cause a distortion. What probably happens it accesses disk and/or paints 
something on the screen that makes your monitor unstable.

What motheboard ? (are they any markers on it ? , can you find the

Actually I think linux kernel checks if apm is enabled in bios and then
turns it's own apm on or off. This is an easy way to see if the computer
is behaving well with apm - if it wasn't the owner would have disabled
apm.

This one I can cure for you :) Do this :
put -R in gpm argument (it will pipe it output thru /dev/gpmdata)
and configure Xserver to use /dev/gpmdata as mouse device with type
"MouseSystems". I have found that gpm understands (generally) more mice
than Xfree. Gpm also behaves better when you disconnect and connect it.

This could be the problem. I haven't seen a store yet (reputable included)
that sold a good computer (at least for Linux, but I'll include Windows as
well). The thing is they always cut costs on something. And they usually
worry more about how many Mhz it has than how stable it is.

Well... My solution to this is to know certain components that do well and
stick to them. Since people ask me to help with their problems I can see
what works and what doesn't.. The fact is even good manufacturers are
prone to save a couple of cents by eliminating a resistor provided the
computer still boots without it.
