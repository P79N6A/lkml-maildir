We spent Wednesday trying to reproduce (without the patch) these issues
without much luck, and have applied the patch cleanly and will continue
testing it.  Given the simplicity of the changes, and the community
testing, I'll give my ack and we will continue testing.
I think we should fix Robert's (unrelated, but in this thread) reported
issue before 2.6.24 final if we can, and I'll look at that tonight and
tomorrow.
Thanks for your work on this Dave,
 Jesse
