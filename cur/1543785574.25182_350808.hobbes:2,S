Ah, I understand now.  I misinterpreted what you said to mean you
didn't expect to see a sync_page call at all.
That said, I'd like to clarify one thing: there is no oops in the
dmesg output.  That stack trace comes from dmesg after I do
"echo t > /proc/sysrq_trigger".
I'll give the 2.6.12 kernel a try today or tomorrow, and see what
happens.
