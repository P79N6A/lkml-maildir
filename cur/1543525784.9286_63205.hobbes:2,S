This is meaningless because pre-2.3 kernels do not contain PCMCIA
drivers.
You need to say what laptop you're using and what version of the
PCMCIA drivers you've got.  I do not know of any such problems with
the current version of the 3c575_cb driver.  I would be very
interested in getting a more complete bug report, if you get this
problem with current drivers.  But I'd need much more information.
