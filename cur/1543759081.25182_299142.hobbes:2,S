alsa-lib is a special case.
alsa-lib exists so that it can mitigate changes between the kernel and 
userland.  If the kernel API changes, alsa-lib may need to be updated, 
but not all the apps using alsa-lib.
Someone needs to put alsa-lib updating on the list of stuff to do when 
updating the kernel...
