Can anyone think of a good reason as to why sys_settimeofday() should
not update the hardware clock (aka RTC) as well?
One possible reason is if different OSes have a different idea of what
the "epoch" is (as is the case on the Alpha, for example), but this is
not an issue in the particular case I'm interested in, so I'm
wondering if there are any other reasons.  Fundamentally, I think it's
needlessly confusing for a user to have to remember to update the
hardware clock separately.
