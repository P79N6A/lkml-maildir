This whole C1E business is a lot of magic trickery in the guts of the
BIOS. I have an X2 box here with an extrem interesting behaviour. C1E
is not advertised at all, but the box freezes with the same symptoms
unless I disable the local apic timer on the kernel command line. I
have no clue how this works internally.
