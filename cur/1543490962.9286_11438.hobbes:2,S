    Andries,
    2.0.37pre is almost if not identical to 2.2.3/4, so our discussions run
    forward and backwards.  2.0.37pre8 is up to date with 2.2.3.
Hmm. Then you are looking at other code than I am.
Alan's 2.0.37-pre-patch-8 introduces a few (minor) bugs compared to 2.0.36
that used to be present in late 2.1.*, early 2.2.* but were corrected in 2.2.2.
I'll construct a diff and send it later this evening.
(Will first have to remove all EZ-Drive related changes.)
