I'm experiencing what superficially appears to be a related problem
with an AWE64 card.  I'm building the drivers non-modular (because
I've yet to find any description of how to configure modular sound
drivers for 2.4.0).  I believe I'm making the appropriate configuration
settings - from my .config:
CONFIG_SOUND=y
CONFIG_SOUND_OSS=y
CONFIG_SOUND_TRACEINIT=y
CONFIG_SOUND_DMAP=y
CONFIG_SOUND_ADLIB=y
CONFIG_SOUND_VMIDI=y
CONFIG_SOUND_SB=y
CONFIG_SOUND_AWE32_SYNTH=y
CONFIG_SOUND_YM3812=y
and I'm passing "opl3=0x388" to the driver.  However, if I query
what synth devices the driver supports, it only reports an
AWE32-0.4.4 (RAM512k) sample device.  I expect it report an FM synth
device, too.  I get the same (lack of) effect if I go via the
adlib_card code, by saying "adlib=0x388".  My investigations so
far have shown that when opl3_detect() first tries to get the
signature of the OPL3 device, it gets 0xff from the inb() (line
195 of drivers/sound/opl3.c in test11pre1), while the corresponding
code in 2.2.18pre19 gets 0x00.
