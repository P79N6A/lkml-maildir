In a conversation with Guillaume Boissiere it was mentioned that setting 
up a bug/problem report database for later in the 2.5 development cycle.  
Cox won't let me run an Apache web server from home with a bugzilla-type 
database (my preference), but I have been playing around with a simplistic 
web page problem report tracking available at 
http://members.cox.net/tmolina
Would something like this be sufficient, or would a full-fledged server be 
required?  Feedback/comments are welcome
