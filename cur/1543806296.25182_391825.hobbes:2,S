OK, I believe this is a false positive.  However, Dave should
double-check this.
tcp_close is only called from process context.  The rule for sk_dst_lock
is that it must also only be obtained in process context.  On the other
hand, it is true that sk_lock can be obtained in softirq context.
In this particular case, sk_dst_lock is obtained by tcp_close with
softirqs disabled.  This is not a problem in itself since we're not
trying to get sk_dst_lock from a real softirq context (as opposed to
process context with softirq disabled).
I believe this warning comes about because the validator creates a
dependency between sk_lock and sk_dst_lock.  It then infers from this
dependency that in softirq contexts where sk_lock is obtained the code
may also attempt to obtain sk_dst_lock.
This inference is where the validator errs.  sk_dst_lock is never
(or should never be, and as far as I can see none of the traces show
it to do so) obtained in a real softirq context.
Cheers,
