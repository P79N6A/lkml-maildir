2.2.3 seems to get to a stage where it processes jusr die as they are
started.
I did a 'ps axwl' and they seem to be stuck doing a scsi_unregister, which
is quite odd since these processes have nothing to do with scsi. The scsi
device I have is the CD-ROM, and the stuck process is actually netscape
and acroread. 
My scsi controller-driver is the 'ncr53c8xx'.
Cheers Mof.
