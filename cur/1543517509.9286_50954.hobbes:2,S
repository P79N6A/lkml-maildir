Hello Folks,
Anyone know where I can find the driver for
network adapter
"IBM PCI EtherJet Management Adapter." This is different from
the IBM PCI EtherJet Adapter for which eepro100 modules works.
But, If I use the eepro100 module for my card that is
"IBM PCI Etherjet Management Adapter", I get a packet loss
of around 35-56% . In windows ( for which there is a driver ), there
is no packet loss at all.  Any help would be appreciated.
I am using kernel 2.2.13 on SuSE 6.2.
TIA
Regards
     Khader
