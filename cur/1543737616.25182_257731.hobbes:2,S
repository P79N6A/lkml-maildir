I'm with you there, Simon.  Not all cpusets should be exclusive.
It is reasonable for domain-capable schedulers, allocators and
resource managers (domain aware CKRM?) require that any domain
they manage correspond to an exclusive cpuset, for some value
of exclusive stronger than now.
Less exclusive cpusets just wouldn't qualify for their own
scheduler, allocator or resource manager domains.
