To the user, maybe. To the admin, no. The admin uses
fuser and/or lsof to find out why he can't umount.
If those programs were thread-aware (they are not),
then they could take many minutes to run.
In other words, stuff runs faster if we can ban this.
If not, please suggest a way to make fuser and lsof fast.

Adding a /proc/task isn't any more trouble.
I guess I'll do that in any case.
If /proc/self should be some deprecated hack that
goes through the invisible non-leader directories
at top-level, then it itself should be made invisible
and a /proc/proc (pointing to tgid) should be added.
A /proc/proc could be backported to 2.4.xx. We'd then
have top-level links for process (tgid, "proc", POSIX PID),
thread (pid, "task", POSIX TID), and... an ugly thing
that we can kill 5 years from now.
