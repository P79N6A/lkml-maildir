Sorry, but the highmem support is not generically useful.
I'm especially against the highmem support. As you said, the rest
looks fine but if you go with pci-swiotlb_32.c, I think that you don't
need the most of them.

I'm not talking about it will be complied or not. As I wrote in
another mail, I'm talking about the maintainability and readability of
the common library.

Can you be more specific? What architecture is plan to use highmem
support in swiotlb?
