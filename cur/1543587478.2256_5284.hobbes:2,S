Hi all,
I have problems with slab management:
While trying to unload a module and destroying cache memory that was
previously allocated
(kmem_cache_destroy routine), I get the following message: "can't free
all objects..."
Then I will get a Oops  if I try to reload the module...
How can I be sure to destroy a cache cleanly?
Thanks for your help
Sebastien
