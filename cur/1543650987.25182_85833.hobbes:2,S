I would like to see a new kind of nonblocking flag that implies the
use of epoll.  So instead of giving O_NONBLOCK to fctnl(F_SETFL), you
give O_NONBLOCK_EPOLL.  In addition to becoming non-blocking, the
socket is added to epoll interest set.  Furthermore, if the socket is
a "listener" socket, all connections accepted on the socket inherit
the non-blocking status and are added automatically to the same epoll
interest set.  It's true that this can get silly though.  I'd like to
do the same with other flags, like TCP_CORK.
