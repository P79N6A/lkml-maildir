Subject: [PATCH] remove rubbish from sl82c105.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Currently, drivers/ide/sl82c105.c has two sets of code in it: some
good code done by Russell King, and some old rubbishy code.  Russell's
code is inside #ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_NETWINDER.  I tried Russell's code
on my Longtrail CHRP PPC box and it not only compiles and links ok
(which the old code doesn't), it also works just fine.
So the patch below takes out the CONFIG_ARCH_NETWINDER and the old
code, so we use Russell's code on all platforms.  I believe that this
file is only used on ARM and PPC so this should be OK.  If anyone else
is using sl82c105.c, please try this patch.
Linus, this patch should be good to apply to your tree.  It won't
break anything that isn't broken already since the old code won't link
at the moment anyway (it references ide_special_settings which isn't
exported from ide-pci.c).
Paul.
