Well, with intel CPUs maybe ;) On PPC we can put some CPUs (at least the
desktop ones and the 970, I don't know about POWER3/4/5) into SLEEP mode
after flushing all caches & masking all IRQs to them, and get them out
via an IPI, or we can mask EE as well and get them out via a soft reset
if we have access to it.
