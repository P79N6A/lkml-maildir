It was definitely part of my thinking. I never thought anyone could do it 
differently so I did not emphasize it.

Basically 4k mmap semantics are preserved. One can mmap any 4k section of 
a compound page. state information is kept in the head page. So we have two
page struct pointers to juggle
1. The one pointing to the page for address calculations COW etc.
2. The one pointing to the head page for state information.
For each 4k pointer from a process to a compound page we would 
have to take a refcount.
