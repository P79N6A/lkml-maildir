Let me add one more point:
  * you can't get the C++ advocates to write the stuff they
    want to see in the kernel themselves
If C++ really is that good for kernel modules, I'd like to
see some code that proves it can be done without too much
of a performance hit (or without a performance hit at all?).
Sending 500 rants to the kernel list isn't even close to
being productive. Sending 1 patch is...
regards,
Rik
