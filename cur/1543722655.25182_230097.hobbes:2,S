ok. after reading up the source, i think xtime isn;t updated frequently and will
not have the required resolution :( so calling do_gettimeofday() seems the only
way out (unless somebody has any other idea).
btw why isn't do_gettimeofday( ) declared as "inline". so its bit
cheaper to call
especially where you are timestamping (say packets) often.
