Subject: 800+ byte inlines in include/net/pkt_act.h

Hi,
include/net/pkt_act.h plays a game of inlines
which are kind of "templatized", like this:
act_ipt.c:
/* ovewrride the defaults */
#define tcf_st          tcf_ipt
#define tcf_t_lock      ipt_lock
#define tcf_ht          tcf_ipt_ht
#define CONFIG_NET_ACT_INIT
#include <net/pkt_act.h>
This results in code duplication. For example,
tcf_generic_walker() is duplicated four times.
On i386 it is about 4*800 bytes in text section.
Other inlines are a bit smaller but still are substantial.
