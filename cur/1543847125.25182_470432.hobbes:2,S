Ok, it looks like that code is assuming that memory area returned by
find_e820_area() is page aligned. I found two such instances and that's
what is leading to problem.
        bootmap_size = init_bootmem_node(NODE_DATA(nodeid),
                                         bootmap_start >> PAGE_SHIFT,
                                         start_pfn, end_pfn);
Here bootmap_start is not page aligned and I guess  currently should
contain the value 0x777BC4 (just beyond _end). But the moement I do
bootmap_start>>PAGE_SHIFT, I start stomping bss.
Similar is the case here.
        bootmap = find_e820_area(0, end_pfn<<PAGE_SHIFT, bootmap_size);
        if (bootmap == -1L)
                panic("Cannot find bootmem map of size %ld\n",bootmap_size);
        bootmap_size = init_bootmem(bootmap >> PAGE_SHIFT, end_pfn);
So may be we should return a page aligned address from find_e820_area(). 
May be we can change bad_addr() to set *addrp to next page aligned 
boundary for every check?
 	*addrp = PAGE_ALIGN(__pa_symbol(&_end));
Thanks
