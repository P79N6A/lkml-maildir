I've just checked. Upon boot-up into text-console (even without
starting X), suspend-to-ram and resume will still corrupt the display.

I've try changing to "intel" and both still doesn't restore the
text-console. "X" restored ok. On my Xorg build, i810_drv.so is linked
to intel_drv.so.
I tried to "revert" the commit, but it doesn't look like it can be
done easily as there're changes after the commit that affected those 2
files.
If there's anything I can help to debug, please let me know.
Thanks,
Jeff.
