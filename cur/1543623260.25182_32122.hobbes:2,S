I guess 4K PAGE_CACHE_SIZE will serve us well for another couple of years, 
and in that time I hope to produce a patch that generalizes the notion of 
page size so we can use the size that works best for each address_space, 
i.e., the same as the filesystem blocksize.
By the way, have you ever seen a sparse 1K blocksize file?  I haven't, I
wouldn't get too worked up about treating the holes a little less than
optimally.
