Hi,
> I am hoping someone can help me with picking the right (read stable) kernel for the following hardware configuration:
> 2x 1Ghz PIII fitted on a serverworks chipset, and 2GB ram.
> Video Card is an Geforce MX-400 twinview setup (no agp, several Geforce cards tried)
> Network is an intergrated intel ether express (eepro100 driver)
If we count out video card for me the best combo so far is
	2.4.9 kernel with intel e100-1.6.13
never had a single problem with it.
(several servers, realmeadia/web/file servers, some with teaming/redundancy ethXs)
