We are talking about
(long)&foo + long_variable
Are you saying that the compiler will be ignoring the high bits in
variable because of the size of foo?

It looks like its useless and more an indication of either a broken
compiler or wrong assumptions about the compiler. Removing RELOC_HIDE
should allow the compiler to freely optimize the per cpu address
calculations.
