Why?  It would not look bad after conversion.  Basically:
static ssize_t ds2760_battery_get_status(struct device *dev,
                struct device_attribute *attr, char *buf)
{
	struct ds2760_device_info *di = to_ds2760_device_info(psy);
	return power_supply_status_str(di->charge_status, buf);
}
static ssize_t ds2760_battery_get_voltage_now(struct device *dev,
                struct device_attribute *attr, char *buf)
{
	struct ds2760_device_info *di = to_ds2760_device_info(psy);
	ds2760_battery_read_status(di);
	return sprintf(buf, "%d\n", di->voltage_uV);
}
...an so on.
If I wanted to get really clever, I could do:
#define DS2760_CALLBACK(name, fmt, var)                       \
static ssize_t ds2760_battery_get_##name(struct device *dev,  \
		struct device_attribute *attr, char *buf)     \
{                                                             \
	struct ds2760_device_info *di = to_ds2760_device_info(psy); \
        ds2760_battery_read_status(di);                       \
	return sprintf(buf, fmt, var);                        \
}
DS2760_CALLBACK(voltage_now, "%d\n", di->voltage_uV)
DS2760_CALLBACK(current_now, "%d\n", di->current_uA)
etc.. but, I'm not trying to compress lines of code, I'm trying
to ensure things are readable.

We're still going to be stuck with a huge switch statement.  Yes, it
wouldn't be *as* big, but ds2760_battery.c has a decently sized switch
statement, and olpc_battery.c has even more properties.
The huge switch statement is the least of my worries, though.  Getting
rid of it is just a bonus.

See below about the eeprom dump.  Originally, it was desired for this
to be a hex string; after that, binary.  Of course, once I actually
started adding device_attributes to olpc_battery.c, I started wondering;
why not just make *all* the properties device_attributes?  And, what if
I want to show something larger than a signed int?  What if I have a
value that I want to pad with 0's?

Well, no, I was talking about the serial number string.  It's not
upstream yet, it's just in OLPC's repo.

Note bat_serial, 17 bytes sitting around.  That's actually not that
bad, merely awkward.  Worse (and what caused me to start reworking
the API) was a dump of the EEPROM contents in hex; basically, (0x80-0x20)*2.
So, a buffer of 192 bytes was required to be kept around in memory.  As
we add more features, we end up w/ more and more wasted space.

Sure, except we have to spend the CPU cycles copying them into the
buffer *anyways*.  After all, that's how power_supply_sysfs gets
the returned char*'s into the sysfs buffer..

The power_supply_properties enum; 'int's are listed first, 'char*'s are
listed second.   power_supply_show_property() assumes that anything
after POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_MODEL_NAME in that list is a char*, and anything
before it is an integer.  No other options are available, and if you
accidentally put an int property somewhere in the strings section; well,
too bad.

I'll reference
http://dev.laptop.org/git?p=olpc-2.6;a=commitdiff;h=f9b4313060ab9047942707da6d3084f7792e714c
again, because it's a good example of the problems w/ the current API.
Basically, we need to add  POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_ACCUM_CURRENT to the core
driver.   I don't see any other power_supply driver actually needing
that; however, the alternative is having magical #defines for those
that are in olpc_battery.c.. and we hope that the core enum list never
accidentally clobbers our internal defines.  ie,
#define OLPC_PROP_ACCUM_CURRENT 0x30
Inside of olpc_bat_get_property:
case OLPC_PROP_ACCUM_CURRENT:
 ...
 break;
And, we hope that include/linux/power_supply.h never grows to include 48
entries inside the power_supply_properties enum (otherwise, we could end
up with power_supply_show_property() mangling OLPC_PROP_ACCUM_CURRENT).
Realistic?  Not overly.  But, having to choose arbitrary numbers is
*not* a desirable way to do things, nor is requiring every single
property from every single driver to end up in the power_supply_properties
enum list.
The power_supply_class docs say, "Power supply class is extensible, and
allows to define drivers own attributes."; however, they don't say *how*
to define their own attributes, and I don't see any power_supply drivers
that are doing that.  This leads me to believe that the API is not
suited for this sort of thing.

Sure, debugfs is an option; however, for a quick and dirty tests, one
of our hardware people wanted to be able to simply view the contents
of the eeprom (and it wasn't clear what format was best.  My assumption
was that hex would be okay, but it turned out to be fairly unreadable.
Binary piped to od was much nicer).

Yes, the callback API is slightly more verbose.  I see that as a good
thing; I don't think the power_supply core should be magically turning
results into what it thinks they should be.  I also think that moving
code out of the power_supply core, and into specific power_supply
drivers is a good idea.  If I'm using pda_power.ko, I don't want all
the excess baggage that olpc_battery.ko might need (and therefore
had to include in power_supply_core).
Finally, to compare code size..  The current API:
-rw-r--r-- 1 dilinger dilinger  56768 2007-12-17 02:21 drivers/power/pda_power.o
-rw-r--r-- 1 dilinger dilinger  31830 2007-12-17 02:21 drivers/power/power_supply_core.o
-rw-r--r-- 1 dilinger dilinger  25120 2007-12-17 02:21 drivers/power/power_supply_leds.o
-rw-r--r-- 1 dilinger dilinger  30220 2007-12-17 02:21 drivers/power/power_supply_sysfs.o
The API I'm suggesting:
-rw-r--r-- 1 dilinger dilinger  55208 2007-12-17 02:19 drivers/power/pda_power.o
-rw-r--r-- 1 dilinger dilinger  30832 2007-12-17 02:19 drivers/power/power_supply_core.o
-rw-r--r-- 1 dilinger dilinger  24232 2007-12-17 02:19 drivers/power/power_supply_leds.o
-rw-r--r-- 1 dilinger dilinger  26680 2007-12-17 02:19 drivers/power/power_supply_sysfs.o
I think I can actually do even better, but I'm not going to bother unless
folks like the new API.
