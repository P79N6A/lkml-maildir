Subject: Source Code Release of NWFS 2.0 for 2.2/2.3/2.4

Alan,
These web accesses look like your folks, so I should probably explain.
We have not re-nigged on letting Red Hat have the source code for NWFS
2.0 (though I am being pressured by to withhold 2.2/2.3/2.4 source so
RedHat and other Linux players do not get it for migration purposes due
to RedHat partisan politics that are negatively impacting not only us,
but our partners and customers), the tools deal you and I discussed is
concluded with TRG retaining full control over the Linux/NT2000 NWFS
code and we are working on clustering for Linux and Windows NT/2000 now
(less 2.4 work) which is what we've wanted to do for a long time.  NWFS
on Linux was simply a side project to increase our familiarity with
Linux and the Linux process in general (and get your VFS interface
developed for our clustering products).  You will be happy to hear that
2.2/2.3 is running with our LRU (still have one deadlock and a memory
corruption problem in Darren's code that he is running down tonight).
However, we have some legitimate gripes, and I think I really don't like
Pavel Machek, Ingo Molinar, and Al Viro's shitty attitudes towards us
and TRG in general (and that they completely ignore emails and requests
for help in areas they claim to own).  If you guys want us to feel like
a part of what you are doing, then I think out of courtesy, when we ask
questions, they should get answered.  We are more than happy to **NOT**
publish any more source code for general use by the Linux Community if
our reward for doing so is to be shit on by a some of the Linux career
politicians just because our views are different or that we come at
Linux from different angles.  
The "partisan" commercial politics (since a lot of these folks have
gotten sucked up into RedHat, Suse, etc.) are preventing folks from
getting help or participating in the process of developing Linux, and
WILL HURT LINUX AND FRAGMENT THE MARKET.  I think all the RedHat stock
and Suse stock everyone now has has gone to some peoples heads.  The
partisan politics are destructive to Linux in general, and if RedHat
employees are going to play them, then so can everyone else, including
us.
I do appreciate your help and have enjoyed our dialogue, but hey, there
has to be something in it for us too, either in the form of
collaboration, technology adoption, or $$$.  To date, less your help, I
have not seen it from the other Linux folks except Linus, and Anvin,
both who try very hard to stay above the petty BS with the commerical
Linux crap.  
I guess what I am trying to say is that if I keep seeing a shift towards
partisan RedHat politics in terms of who gets to contribute and getting
included in the process of what's going on, we can just as easily act
like everyone else, and be "greedy" too, an withhold our stuff.   
I think the next time one of my requests is ignored, we will simply not
publish any more source code, and just let CALDERA customers get access
to binaries.  With what we get from our Microsoft Windows NT/2000
customers, why should we tolerate this type of crap when we aren't
getting what we expect out of our hard work on Linux.   
Your friend,
Jeff  Merkey
CEO, TRG
