No, I wasn't claiming that SMB will recover from a server crash gracefully.
If your SMB server goes down (upgrade being likely with samba instead of
crash...) for whatever reason, any open file connections are hosed.
I was just stating that there are Network FSes that are stateful, and work
good when the server stays up.
As stated by Alan, you can make a stateful Net FS that deals gracefully with
crash recovery, it's just harder.
Also, SMB deals with crashed clients pretty well most of the time by
querying the client with the write lock to see if it's still there...
