Sure. Though that might produce weird output from
simple_read_from_buffer() -- no newline.
I've switched this and the strcmp() code below.

What are the rules of using subsystem pointers from the cgroup? Suppose
I did:
rcu_read_lock();
cgroup = task_cgroup(task, freezer_subsys_id);
freezer = cgroup_freezer(cgroup);
state = freezer->state;
rcu_read_unlock();
return (state == STATE_FROZEN);
(And guard writes to freezer->state with the freezer->lock)
?

Doesn't the safety of that assumption depend on the architecture _and_
compiler?

Removed.

OK. I used your comment. :)

Yup. Changed to use a fixed buffer.

Seems like a good idea for this cgroup subsystem at least.

Done.
