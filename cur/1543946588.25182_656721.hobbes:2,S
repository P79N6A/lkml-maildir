Comparing with kernel 2.6.24, tbench result has regression with
2.6.25-rc1.
1) On 2 quad-core processor stoakley: 4%.
2) On 4 quad-core processor tigerton: more than 30%.
bisect located below patch.

    [IPV6]: Move nfheader_len into rt6_info
    The dst member nfheader_len is only used by IPv6.  It's also currently
    creating a rather ugly alignment hole in struct dst.  Therefore this patch
    moves it from there into struct rt6_info.
Above patch changes the cache line alignment, especially member __refcnt. I did a 
testing by adding 2 unsigned long pading before lastuse, so the 3 members,
lastuse/__refcnt/__use, are moved to next cache line. The performance is recovered.
I created a patch to rearrange the members in struct dst_entry.
With Eric and Valdis Kletnieks's suggestion, I made finer arrangement.
1) Move tclassid under ops in case CONFIG_NET_CLS_ROUTE=y. So sizeof(dst_entry)=200
no matter if CONFIG_NET_CLS_ROUTE=y/n. I tested many patches on my 16-core tigerton by
moving tclassid to different place. It looks like tclassid could also have impact on
performance.
If moving tclassid before metrics, or just don't move tclassid, the performance isn't
good. So I move it behind metrics.
2) Add comments before __refcnt.
On 16-core tigerton:
If CONFIG_NET_CLS_ROUTE=y, the result with below patch is about 18% better than
the one without the patch;
If CONFIG_NET_CLS_ROUTE=n, the result with below patch is about 30% better than
the one without the patch.
With 32bit 2.6.25-rc1 on 8-core stoakley, the new patch doesn't introduce regression.
Thank Eric, Valdis, and David!
