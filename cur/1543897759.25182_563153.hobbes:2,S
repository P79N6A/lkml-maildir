Makes sense to me, thanks.  I guess fs/nsfd/nfssvc:nfsd_create_serv()
should be similarly modified?  It calculates the size of per-nfsd-thread
buffers used to hold requests, which will eventually be allocated with
an alloc_page(GFP_KERNEL), and it bases the calculation on the same
.totalram field from struct sysinfo.
