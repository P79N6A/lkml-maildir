Chris,
Do you know if the people reporting the corruption with reiserfs on
2.4 were using IDE drives with PIO mode and IDE multicount turned on?
If so, it may be caused by the problem fixed by Russell King on
2.4.2-pre2. 
Without his fix, I was able to corrupt ext2 while using PIO+multicount
very very easily.
