Hello,
Im trying to run libata driver on my Asus A7N8X-deluxe 
(latest bios 1008) with Sil 3112a controller, but i'm 
permanently getting "irq 11: nobody cared.....disabling 
irq11" error. After this error computer hangs totally. I 
found some info about enabling "Enhanced mode" and "Sata 
only" options in bios, but they are not avalible in my 
motherboard. I've managed to chatch some, hopefully, useful 
info through netconsole. My kernel config and lspci output 
are also there. This log was made with  ACPI compiled in, 
but there was exactly same problem when ACPI was not 
compiled in.

netconsole.
