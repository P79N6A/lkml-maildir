Subject: [help] _syscall2 fails with -fPIC

Hello,
I am building a -fPIC shared object that will define and access a Linux
kernel system call, but _syscall2 fails with -fPIC .so compilation.
What can I do?
        F.E. the statement:
_syscall2 (int, tux, unsigned int, action, user_req_t *, req)
Gives the following gcc error when compiled with -fPIC:
tst.c: In function `tux':
tst.c:62: Invalid `asm' statement:
tst.c:62: fixed or forbidden register 3 (bx) was spilled for class
BREG.
If the -fPIC isn't there it compiles fine. Unfortunately I need to find
another way as I have to use -fPIC.
Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
