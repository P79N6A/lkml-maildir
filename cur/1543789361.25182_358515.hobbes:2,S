i'm package maintainer of kernel26mm in archlinux (i686).
the compiler is gcc 4.0.2 with some bugs fixed it had (from 
4.0.3-snapshot).
yes, jsm-tty is built as module, as can be seen from output i posted.
the only difference from 2.6.14-rc4-mm1 and the one i compile is the 
applied cleanup patch 
	2614-rc4-mm-sparse-fixes.patch 
that was announced on the mailinglist just after the rc4-mm1 release.
if you need the config, it can be found here:
http://cvs.archlinux.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/kernels/kernel26mm/?cvsroot=Extra&only_with_tag=HEAD
i'm willing to apply any patches that would make kernel26mm again compile 
all ttys successfully (the last one that did is 2.6.15-rc5-mm1).
thanx + greetings,
Damir

I think it's a new feature.  Don't tell anyone it was an accident.  :-)
