Fbsplash - The Framebuffer Splash - is a feature that allows displaying
images in the background of consoles that use fbcon. The project is
partially descended from bootsplash. 
Unlike bootsplash, fbsplash has no in-kernel image decoder. Picture 
decompression is handled by a userspace helper which provides raw image 
data to the kernel. There is also no support for things like the silent 
mode and progress bars, as these are best handled by userspace programs. 
Truecolor, directcolor and pseudocolor modes are supported. Fbsplash has
no dependency on a specific framebuffer driver. It has been tested with
at least vesafb, rivafb and radeonfb.
Technical details about the userspace<->kernelspace interface can be 
found in patch 07/07, which contains the documentation.
The userspace utilities that make use of fbsplash can be found on:

Live long and prosper.
