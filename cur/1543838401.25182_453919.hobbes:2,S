There are quite a lot of different S270 laptops. And the laptops are
sold under various brands and names, hence it's not that specific. 
Until now I found the laptop under the brands MSI, Cytron, TCM,
Medion, Tchibo and the names MegaBook, S270, MD96100, MS-1013,
SAM2000. And I am sure there are even more names/brands...

The driver uses the ACPI EC but doesn't call any ACPI DSDT method. On
request of Len Brown I moved the driver out of the /drivers/acpi/
namespace and made it use sysfs instead of /proc/acpi:
http://lwn.net/Articles/194916/
Hence I don't think it is a good idea to prefix the driver name with
"acpi_".
I would like to support other laptop models from MSI (specifically
S260), however I don't have access to any of them or to the necessary
hardware information.
But yes, I guess I could rename the driver to "laptop_msi.c" or
something. Although I don't know if the other models use a similar
ACPI EC interface to the S270 model. 
If anyone has a S260 and wants to test this driver on it: please
contact me!
