ok, I'll apply the previous "delack-timer-1" patch,
as well as the one below. However, can you upload
the below patch to the ftp.*.kernel.org mirrors also,
just so I can ensure the spacings and such are correct.
Thanks.

As a side note, the machines have still have not crashed,
so almost certainly the TCP_DELAY_ACK bug is the culprit,
at least in UniProcessor case. Going to try using SMP
kernel again after I'm sure these patches do the job.
Thanks for your help ...
