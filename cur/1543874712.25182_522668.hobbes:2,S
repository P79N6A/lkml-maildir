It was in doing kernel builds that I hit it, nothing special: an
overnight cycle of kernel building would collapse in a few hours.
openSUSE 10.2.
If that doesn't reproduce it for you, let me know and I'll try again
with the original patch, to reproduce it here: maybe something else
has changed in 2.6.21-rc to affect it.

Andi would tell definitively, but I guess it's merely that with so
much more address space to play with, x86_64 can divide up that space
more satisfactorily.
But don't be misled: try "ulimit -s unlimited" and I expect you'll
find i386 allocating mmap addresses (hence libraries) from the
opposite end, below ELF_ET_DYN_BASE.
