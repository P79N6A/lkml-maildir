Dear Mike,
>Tea, Earl Grey, Hot...
please take one of that and calm down. There are people with no choice
other than ignoring their builtin modems (think Laptop. Think Palmtop). 
There are some software-driven DSP modems (Lucent comes to mind),
which would be very nice having under Linux.
And there is the idea of pulling people with existing hardware from
Windows to Linux.
	Kind regards
