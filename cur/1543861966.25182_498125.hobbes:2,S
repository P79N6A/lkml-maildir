But isn't AHCI a new standard intel helped develop?  Why would they want
to make it hard to use intel hardware using a standard interface intel
helped create?  It makes no sense.  Linux doesn't care if the sata is
set to the old PATA compatible interface, or the new AHCI mode.  Windows
simply can't boot in AHCI mode and refuses to install a driver for
AHCI mode when it is not already in AHCI mode.
