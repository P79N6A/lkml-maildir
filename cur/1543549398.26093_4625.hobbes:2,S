Subject: [patch] 2.4 version of my duplicate IP and MAC detection patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I updated my duplicate IP detection patch to work with 2.4.
I announced  the 2.2 version  here last  year, and several  people expressed
interest in it, but it never  made it into the kernel unfortunately. I asked
a few times and  eventually gave up as I didn't want  to appear overly pushy
and it got included in the kernels that I use (kernels from VA).
I didn't receive  any negative comments, except for Alexey  who believed the
check should be done in user space.
The patches (2.2/2.4) and discussion can be found here:
http://marc.merlins.org/linux/arppatch/
Here are two excerpts:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What does the patch do?
It looks at all the broadcast ARP  requests and checks that the source IP of
the request is different from the  interface's IP. This will catch a machine
that is using your IP and is trying to talk to a machine on your net for the
first time or the first time in a while.
The big plus of this approach is that it's passive 
It will get your system to output this: 
Uh Oh, MAC address 00:A0:C9:EE:9C:8A claims to have our IP addresses
(192.168.205.9) (duplicate IP conflict likely)
or this: 
Uh Oh, I received an ARP packet claiming to be from our MAC address
00:80:C8:47:37:72, but with an IP I don't own (192.168.205.1). Someone has
apparently stolen our MAC address
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But then why not write the whole thing in user space?
Well, the line has  to be drawn somewhere... The whole IP  stack could be in
user space  if we  wanted... In this  case, the actual  added code  (I'm not
talking about the existing code which I  turned into a function) is about 20
lines, it's trivial and it uses much  less resources on a slow machine (386)
than a  user space solution which  forces a context switches,  system calls,
and memory for that user process.
Also, not  that others are always  right, but do  you know any OS  that does
duplicate IP checking by inspecting ARP requests in user space?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm attaching the 2.4  version which I'd really like to  see included in the
main tree. While I don't see a good reason to disable this, if what it takes
is a  config option, experimental  or not, disabled  by default or  not (I'd
rather  have it  non experimental  since  it's a  year old,  and enabled  by
default, but I'll settle), I'll do what it takes.
I'm attaching the 2.4  version and you can find the 2.2  version, as well as
more info on my page:

Thanks,
Marc
