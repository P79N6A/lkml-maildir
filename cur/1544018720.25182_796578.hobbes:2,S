Subject: [PATCH RFT 6/7] ieee1394: sbp2: add workarounds for 2nd and 3rd generation iPods
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/24/83

According to 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/294391
  - 3rd generation iPods need the "fix capacity" workaround after all
    (apparently they crash after the last sector was accessed),
  - 2nd generation iPods need the "128 kB maximum request size"
    workaround.
Furthermore, Kristian Høgsberg mentioned that 2nd generation iPods
treat page tables (scatter-gather lists) as data buffers, i.e. ignore
the page_table_present bit of command block ORBs.  If this is true, then
the 128 kB limit is not a sufficient workaround; instead we have to
guarantee that all requests have only a single s/g element.  This could
be up to 64 kByte - 4 Bytes in size.  But I expect the block layer to
typically emit much smaller elements than that, alas.
Alas both iPod generations feature the same model ID in the config ROM,
hence we can only define a shared quirks list entry for them.  This is
bad since
  - the "fix capacity" workaround prevents access to the very last
    sector if a device does not actually have this bug,
  - the "no page tables" workaround dramatically reduces throughput,
    e.g. from 25 to 9 MB/s without gap count optimization, and from 36
    11 MB/s with gap count optimization (as per hdparm with a regular
    3.5" S400 disk on an i686 PC without IOMMU).  Whether this matters
    with the already slow iPod disk is not yet known.
This patch needs testing by somebody who has the hardware:
  - Do 2nd and 3rd gen. iPods actually have a model_id == 0, or do they
    have in fact no model_id at all?
  - Does the "fix capacity" workaround harm usage of 2nd gen. iPods?
  - Is the "no page tables" workaround really necessary for 2nd gen.
    iPods, or is the 128k limit sufficient as reported for the Ubuntu
    8.10 kernel?
  - How badly does the "no page tables" workaround affect throughput of
    3rd gen. iPods which don't need it?
A side note:  Apple computers in target mode (or at least an x86 Mac
mini) don't have firmware_version and model_id, hence none of the iPod
quirks list entries is active for them.
