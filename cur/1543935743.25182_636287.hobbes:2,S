That gives
/home/lsrc/quilt/linux/arch/x86/kernel/setup_64.c: In function 'setup_arch':
/home/lsrc/quilt/linux/arch/x86/kernel/setup_64.c:468: error: implicit declarati
on of function 'map_vsyscall'
But after I add a prototype to vsyscall.h it seems to work.
Just the barriers are still broken -- you have not replied to any 
of my emails on that topic. What's up with that?
