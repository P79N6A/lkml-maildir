What a lovely way of syncing reality with your definitions. The kernel
_does_ see that my CPU features PAT, it just refuses to use it because
it doesn't trust it enough. Vital difference. Maybe not to the kernel,
but definitely to me, the user. /proc/cpuinfo is a user interface.
PAT is a CPU, hardware, flag documented in the arch manuals. If the
kernel wants to keep software flags as well why not simply add those?

Really, I'm not so much anxious about PAT as I got anxious about seeing
my entire CPU famility dropped without a single explanation. Had the one
you provide above be in the commit message this thread had not happened
(yes, although redefining X86_FEATURE_PAT is still crap).
As it's merged, nothing said that it was specifically not using and/or
disabling PAT just that it wasn't supported. Even if it had done _that_
much this thread would've probably not happened.
Rene.
