Ok great, things are clear now, I apparently missed your original patch
in the noise last time I checked this thread and I only focused on
Andrew's proposed fix, and the two patches are both good and 
orthogonal with each other.  I agree your patch is needed and it should
fix the blkdev write on > 1G. Without it the VM is guaranteed to run oom
in your setup, since whatever we writeback, it can be made dirty again
before we can attempt to free it.
