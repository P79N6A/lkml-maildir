No, that's not how it ever worked. There are parameters that are
available in the reboot-system call that define the operation that
will occur when the 3-finger salute occurs.
Execute man 2 reboot.

The systems to which I refer do not, and never even had a file-system,
much-less any inittab. That's SYS-V init stuff for interactive access.

The kernel's response (or the 'C' runtime-library interface) has
changed so that it is now possible for somebody at the keyboard
of a machine to destroy the machine's operation by executing
Ctl-Alt-Del. I don't know how long this potential catastrophe
has existed, but when the machine(s) were initially certified
there was no possible way for a user to kill the machine from
the keyboard.
It is possible that a 'C' runtime library was changed in the
tarket so it's not a kernel problem. I'm checking it out now.
