He said having reality checks is a good thing. He's encouraging some
poor bastard to maintain plugsched out of mainline to have SD or
whatever to compare to. I did not say I advocated anything whatsoever.
I was asking if this is what Ingo is suggesting people use their
energy doing. Not good enough for mainline, but definitely worth
keeping around and good enough for... no idea what. I was asking Ingo
