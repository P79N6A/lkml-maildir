Subject: [PATCH] powerpc dmasound compilation fix (TRIVIAL), kernel 2.6.11
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The patch below fixes the following problem: 
Compile error when compiling with CONFIG_DMASOUND_PMAC defined
and CONFIG_NVRAM not defined.
The 2.6 kernel has had this problem since 2.6.8 [1], possibly longer.
Details:
The error is 
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
sound/built-in.o(.init.text+0xb68): In function `dmasound_awacs_init':
: undefined reference to `pmac_xpram_read'
make[1]: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
sound/oss/dmasound/dmasound_awacs.c calls the function pmac_xpram_read(int) in 
the function dmasound_awacs_init() without making sure that CONFIG_NVRAM (the 
"provider" of this function) is defined. Other users of pmac_xpram_read(int) 
checks for this. 
The specific call is 
vol = ((pmac_xpram_read( 8 ) & 7 ) << 1 );
 -- it just sets the volume, so we don't need to force users of 
CONFIG_DMASOUND_PMAC to use CONFIG_NVRAM, IMHO.
Patch against 2.6.11.5:

-----------
I've tested the new case when vol gets set to 0, and it has no ill effects. 
It's how it's done in dmasound_atari.c:TTMixerInit(). 
The test was limited to compile and boot the patched kernel, test 
that sound and boot-up worked as normal (as it did earlier without the patch 
applied).
