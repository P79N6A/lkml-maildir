I used -isosize (copying from another CD), which has an effect similar to
-pad. Just tried with -pad - same. -dao, as suggested by Kasper Dupont
<kasperd@daimi.au.dk>, doesn't help either. On the contrary, the latter
makes the error appear in all 3 reads - ide-scsi, ide, scsi (I used it
together with -isosize). Also strange, the number of blocks read by dd
bs=2048 on ide and scsi from the same disk differ...

But, as I described, a native SCSI-CD/DVD-drive reads this disk without
problems.
