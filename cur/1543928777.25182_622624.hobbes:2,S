Brief summary/reminder:
The kernel uses %fs in 32-bit mode and %gs in 64-bit mode.
User space TLS uses %gs in 32-bit mode and %fs in 64-bit mode.
The 64-bit kernel has to use %gs in order for SWAPGS to be available to 
it (by which time the 32-bit ABI was already fixed.)  It is advantageous 
for user space to use the register the kernel typically won't, in order 
to speed up system call entry/exit.
