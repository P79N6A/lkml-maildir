Hi Larry, thanks for replying.
I have to admit, I've never used either of these before, so I'm not
sure if I did this correctly.
I created two different packet dumps using kismet, one when my laptop
was using b43 and the other when it was using bcm43xx. While my
desktop was logging, I used my laptop to go to kernel.org and download
patch-2.6.23.11.bz2 (both times the browser started at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/
). Then I used tshark to parse
the dump files and create two new readable logs.
I'll attach these logs since I can't read much into them. The only
strange difference I noticed is that with b43, I got messages like
ICMP Destination unreachable (Host administratively prohibited), which
I didn't get with bcm43xx.
There's about 5 machines connected to this network -- the laptop with
the broadcom card has internal ip 192.168.0.3.
