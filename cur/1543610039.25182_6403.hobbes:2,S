Davide,
Suppose you have a 2 CPU system with 4 runnable tasks.  3 of these
tasks are realtime with the same realtime priority and the other is
an ordinary SCHED_OTHER task.  The task distribution on the runqueues
looks something like this.
CPU 0             CPU 1
---------         ---------
RT Task A         RT Task B
Other Task C      RT Task D
Task A and Task B are currently running on the 2 CPUs.  Now, Task A
voluntarily gives up CPU 0 and Task B is still running on CPU 1.
At this point, Task D should be chosen to run on CPU 0.  Correct?
Isn't this a required RT semantic?  I'm curious how you plan on
accomplishing this.
Regards,
