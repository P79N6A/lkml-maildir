Yuck! Why panic when you know what is needed? A better solution is to
tell the user they've messed up and given them the option to (1) reboot
and try another kernel or (2) have swsusp restore the original swap
signature and continue booting. This is what suspend2 does (with a
timeout for the prompt). It's not that hard.

Nigel
