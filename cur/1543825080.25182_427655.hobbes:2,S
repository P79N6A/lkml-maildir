Is there a problem with the forcedeth driver not being compatible with 
the Asus K8N-VM motherboard? I installed Fedora Core 5 and the Ethernet 
doesn't want to work. I installed the latest FC5 kernel which is some 
flavor og 2.6.16 and it still doesn't work. The FC4 CD and rescue disk 
don't work either. Windows XP however does work so I know that hardware 
is good.
lspci says the hardware is an nVidia MCP51 ethernet controller. What am 
I missing?
Thanks in advance.
