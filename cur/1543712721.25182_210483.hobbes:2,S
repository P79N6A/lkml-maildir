That's OK, neither does anyone else ;-) OK, for HPC workloads they do,
but not for other stuff.
The closest I can come conceptually is to run multiple instances of a 
Java benchmark in parallel. The existing ones all tend to be either 1 
process with many threads, or many processes each with one thread. There's 
no m x n benchamrks around I've found, and that seems to be a lot more 
like what the customers I've seen are interested in (throwing a DB, 
webserver, java, etc all on one machine).
Making balance_on_fork a userspace hintable thing wouldn't hurt us at all
though, and would provide a great escape route for the HPC people. 
Some simple pokeable in /proc would probably be sufficient. balance_on_clone
is harder, as whether you want to do it or not depends more on the state
of the rest of the system, which is very hard for userspace to know ...
