Subject: pilot USB HotSync broken in -mm kernels

Hi Andrew, hil lists!
USB HotSyncing is not working ATM with -mm kernels: I tried 2.6.5
(vanilla) and had no problem installing a big file with pilot-xfer -I,
but using 2.6.5-mm1 the palm suddenly tells me
	Cleaning up
and then
	The connection was terminated ... not all files synced ...
I have tested several mm Versions (2.6.5-rc?-mm?), none of them were
working, but the vanilla kernel 2.6.5 and 2.6.4 are working.
The diffs in the .config files wrt USB (for 2.6.5(-mm1)):
+CONFIG_USB_EHCI_ROOT_HUB_TT=y
But since this options was only introduced in 2.6.5-mm1 (or was it
rc3-mm4?) this cannot make the difference.
Thanks a lot for any ideas/hints how to fix this.
BTW: debian/sid 
Best wishes
Norbert

certain if this was because they were trying to see more
clearly, or if they simply wanted to leave at this point.
