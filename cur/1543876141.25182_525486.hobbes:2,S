So..  this change will cause a fatal error for anyone who is presently
using max_loop, won't it?  If they're doing that within their
initramfs/initrd/etc then things could get rather ugly for them.
I don't know how much of a problem this will be in practice - do people use
max_loop much?
btw, did you test this change as both a module and as linked-into-vmlinux?
