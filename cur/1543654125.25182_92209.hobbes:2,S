Thanks for catching this. There are two things wrong: register_disk() is 
calling kobject_register() instead of kobject_add(). This is fixed with a 
patch I posted earlier today. 
Also, though it is now irrelevant in this case, kobject_register() was 
causing the object to be freed if kobject_add() failed. This is a bit 
rude, though kobject_add() really shoudln't fail. It can fail because of 
these reasons: 
- sysfs isn't mounted yet. 
- we couldn't get an inode.
- the file or directory already existed. 
In each case, we probably want to know about it. So, the patch below 
changes the call to kobject_cleanup() to a WARN_ON(error) to flag it, but 
continue going..
Thanks,
