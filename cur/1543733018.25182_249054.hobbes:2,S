Even if you are not speaking for Thungesten you pretty much show that
Thungsten has developers that in an area that overlaps with their works are
not willing to get things done the kernel way.
This should be a v ery big warnings sign for potentitial Thungsten Customers
to look for a better supplier or at least give very strong directions.
