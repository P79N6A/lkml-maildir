cramfs is _wonderful_ as long as you don't have to write. Very simple, and
very efficient.

Not that I know of. All the read-write compressions tend to also compress
much less than something like cramfs, because the metadata requirements
for a read-write filesystem are usually a lot stricter and more
complicated.
A compressing JFFS sounds wonderful, although I suspect that even then it
might be useful to have a read-only side that compresses even better.
Compressed ext2 is horrible compression-wise. The metadata takes up
a large amount of space..
