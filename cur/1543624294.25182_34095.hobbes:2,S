Subject: Upgrading Headers?

When a person switches to, or upgrades a kernel, how do they upgrade the
associated header files?  The headers in /usr/include won't match the kernel.
I don't see anything about that in the documentation.
When I want to program with my new kernel I need to use the new headers, so I 
have to use #include <linux/fcntl.h> instead of #include <fcntl.h>.  This 
seems odd.
