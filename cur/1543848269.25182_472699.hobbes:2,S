Well, it depends on definition of 'hot'. What would for example happen in 
the case suspend-to-disk -> remove the card when the machine is switched 
off -> resume-from-disk? I guess that exactly this pci_enable_device() 
will fail, so we definitely have to handle this case, as it can easily 
happen.

As you wish. 
[PATCH] fix sk98lin driver, ignoring return value from pci_enable_device()
add check of return value to _resume() function of sk98lin driver.
