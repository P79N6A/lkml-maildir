Hi, All.
This is just an update on my earlier e-mail.

With 2.6.13-rc1-mm1, it works if I patch sbp2.[ch] *and* pass the
disable_irm parameter. If I don't pass the parameter, I get the same
strange behaviour as I did before.
I have not yet tested with a vanilla 2.6.13-rc1-mm1 (i.e., without patching
sbp2.[ch]) and with disable_irm=1. I can test this, if desired or any other
thing that you may want me to test.
Thanks, Rogério Brito.
