You're right, it's not unique.  Will they run 2.4?  I've got about a dozen
boxes that have had over a year uptime with 2.0 or 2.2, but won't boot with
the 2.4 or the recent 2.5 I tried.

Good question.  With the 2.4 kernels I've tried zImages worked fine but
bzImages wouldn't boot.   Unfortunately, with the options I need, the kernel
won't fit in a zImage.  The servers were all originally AMI motherboards,
but after replacing a few due to failures, there's a few Abit, Tyans and
Gigabyte replacements.  The Gigabyte (model GA-8IRXP, I think) will boot
bzImages, but I hate to replace motherboards that have worked fine for years
just to boot the new 2.6/3.0.
