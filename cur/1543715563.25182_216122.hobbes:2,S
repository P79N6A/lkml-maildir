I've tested 2.6.2 with the reverted patch and it seems to work.
Normally it takes <1min to crash the system when I access the discs
on the controller, with the patched driver it works >1 hour without a error.
Also I've copied the driver to the 2.6.5 tree now trying this (after 
disabling the procfs code, it seems that it has changed).

Yes, then /proc/interrupts shows that it uses the XT-PIC, but it also
crashes (now without a Oops, totally freezed).
