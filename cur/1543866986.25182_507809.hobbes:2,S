batch() would possibly make a lot of sense in terms of the fibril/thread
based removal for the need for all the AIO stuff, just to provide a
natural way to group and order sequences of synchronous operations into
asynchronous groups.
I am extremely sceptical about the need for aio_sendfile_path since with
sendfile/sendpath hacking around there didn't seem to be much gain.
I'm even more sceptical of the header buffer stuff as while other OS's do
that as a hack to make TCP packetising work we simply fixed the root
problem with TCP_CORK
