The bonus of the approach in my patch is that we won't reschedule unless
the lock count is zero (due to the preemptive kernel), so we do not need
to worry about the above.  The only concern would be if there is ever a
case where the critical region is the entire chunk we want to zap (e.g.
we must zap the entire inputted range atomically) but I do not see that
ever being the case.
