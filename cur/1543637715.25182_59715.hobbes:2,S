Please don't remove this.
insert_special isn't just used to start new requests, it's also used to queue 
incoming requests that cannot be processed by the device (host adapter, 
queue_full etc.).
In this latter case, the tag is already begun, so it needs to go back with 
end_tag (we start a new tag when the device begins processing again).
I own up to introducing the &= REQ_QUEUED rubbish---I was just keeping the 
original  placement of the flag clearing code, but now we need to preserve 
whether the request was queued or not for the blk_rq_tagged check.  On 
reflection it would have been better just to set the flags to REQ_SPECIAL | 
REQ_BARRIER after the end tag code.

Hmm, well I sent it to you and you are the Maintainer.

P.S. I just got back into the US from a long flight, I'll give this more 
mature reflection tomorrow.
