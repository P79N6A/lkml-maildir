Geometry detection by looking for error returns is fundamentally broken. 
  Way too many non-traditional floppies (USB, IDE...) do not handle this 
at all, they will return successfully, with the data being the data from 
a sector from another track, and thus you end up with aliasing and a 
corrupt boot.  You can do it with fingerprinting, but that's complex and 
error-prone.
In short, this made sense in 1991, but it hasn't made sense for a very 
long time now.  Resurrecting bootsect.S is *NOT* a good idea.
