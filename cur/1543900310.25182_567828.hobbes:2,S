I was perhaps too unkind: that fear was not irrational in 2.4,
when reclaim scanned vmas; but in 2.6, pages have to be on one
of reclaim's LRUs to fall vulnerable to it.

We could indeed, though I'd rather not jump into that: something
to do when we tidy up those driver mmaps (something I promised to
do 18 months ago?), there's a lot of pointless flag setting.

That must be an exciting new State of the Art version of fglrx.
Looking at what I downloaded for inspection a year ago, I can't
see any sign of that.  But I do see lots of random stabs at setting
different vm_flags in different mmap cases (VM_IO, VM_SHM, VM_RESERVED,
VM_LOCKED): of which the VM_IO serves some point, VM_SHM is defunct,
VM_RESERVED will be defunct, and VM_LOCKED can confuse us.
But interestingly, where they set VM_LOCKED, they did increment
vm_locked: so there shouldn't be that issue of wrapping negative
on munmap, which had worried me.  And now I look at Dmitry's
patch again, I see that he was indeed assuming that the driver
had done that incrementation.

Well, they'll get what they deserve.  I'm not convinced Dmitry's right
about their nopage; and I'm not going to waste any more time working
out ways to protect ourselves from them.  Let's stick with the mspec.
