Great!
Like I said, all of this started out when the CONDOR developers told me
that they would be able to give users like me totally transparent checkpointing
and process migration on NT, whereas on UNIX (Solaris, LINUX, etc.)
you have to compile and link your code specially.
Maybe the problem is just that batch queue developers like Werner,
or the CONDOR folk, have been so hot on having solutions portable
across all UNIXes that they have not been willing to make LINUX specific
modifications.
I look forward to using stuff like this in future versions of GNU QUEUE
and CONDOR. Transparent checkpointing, process migration, and
ex-post-facto being able to take a running job, and migrating it somewhere
else.
