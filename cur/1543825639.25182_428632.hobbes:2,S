They are.
u32 ports;
ports = lport;
ports <<= 16;
ports |= fport;

It was done to simulate socket code which uses the same folding.
Leaving 32bit space is just wrong, consider hash table size with that
index.

It is comparison of the approach used in TCP hashing code, it is not full 
mathematical analysis. And in that case jenkins hash already not good. 
I'm sure it can be tuned, but it does require a lot of iterations, while
XOR one "just works".
