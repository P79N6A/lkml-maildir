Just a point of view from someone who has to parse /proc/cpuinfo.
That sort of file tree thing is useful to work from the command line but its
a kick in the a** to use from a program.
This makes you just to re-parse the tree each time you have to get the info
(open, read, atoi, close...) to fill your internal variables.
I don't know if its possible, but I would like something like:
__packt_it_tight_please struct cpumap_t {
	u16	ncpus;
	u16	ncpus_onln;
	u16	ncpus_inmyset;  // for procsets
	// Here possibly more info about topology, pack-core-thread structure...
	// in simple arrays...
};
struct cpumap_t *cpumap = mmap("/proc/sys/hw/cpumap",sizeof(struct cpumap_t));
for (...cpumap->ncpus_inmyset ....)  // 
As I said, I don't know if its possible. I vaguely remember some comments
against binary info in /proc...
Even it could be simplified if you realize some things:
- Usually people dont worry about if cpus are all the online ones or I'm
  running in a proc set. Just want to know how many can I use.
- Don't care if they are hyper-threaded, cores os independent processors.
  To adjust processing for hyper-threaded cpus, one needs to tie processes
  to processors, and you need to be root for that.
  Really, anything dependent on topology is not usable for normal programs,
  because you need to be root to control that.
  So topology is not so important.
Some (probably stupid) ideas...
