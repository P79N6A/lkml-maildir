It's more than that. I added the check after some person who had been 
programming the kernel (and thus was supposedly fluent in C) literally 
could not parse a macro that had "do x while (y)" in it.
Why? Because it's so uncommon, and because "while (y)" on its own means 
something totally different.
So the syntactic sugar to _always_ have do-while loops have that brace is 
a way to avoid one of the rather few places where the C language has 
syntax that is very context-dependent.
Another example of this is "sizeof". The kernel universally (I hope) has 
parenthesis around the sizeof argument, even though it's clearly not 
required by the C language. 
It's a coding standard. 
And quite frankly, anybody who works on gcc has no place complaining about 
sparse coding standard warnings. They are a _hell_ of a lot better than 
some of the really crazy warnings gcc spews out with "-W". At least the 
sparse warnings you can make go away while making the code more 
understandable. Some of the -W warnings are unfixable without breaking the 
source code.
