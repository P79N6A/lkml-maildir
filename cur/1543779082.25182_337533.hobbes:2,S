Subject: [patch 11/29] I2C: 24RF08 corruption prevention (again)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/29/356

From: Jean Delvare <khali@linux-fr.org>
The 24RF08 corruption prevention in the eeprom and max6875 drivers wasn't
complete. For one thing, the additional quick write should happen as soon
as possible and unconditionally, while both drivers had error paths before.
For another, when a given chip is forced, the core does not emit a quick
write, so a second quick write would cause the corruption rather than
prevent it.
I plan to move the corruption prevention in the core in the long run, so
that individual drivers don't have to care anymore. But I need to merge
i2c_probe and i2c_detect before I do (work in progress).
