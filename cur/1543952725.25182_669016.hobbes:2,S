It is called with vfsmount_lock in *all* cases.  You've missed one
in umount_tree(), BTW; you won't block in that case, though.

Not the issue.

Callers manipulate more than propagation tree.  Note that e.g.
umount_tree() changes all sorts of data structures, including ones
that are traversed without namespace_sem.
I _really_ don't like the idea of different locking rules for caller
of a function depending on the value of argument of that function.
They are complicated enough as it is.
Argh...  OK, I'll try to put something together tonight, after I get some
sleep - 31 hours of uptime _suck_ ;-/  BTW, on top of everything else,
the current variant plays interesting games with CL_PROPAGATION behaviour
and I really don't like the look of what it's doing there.  Later...
