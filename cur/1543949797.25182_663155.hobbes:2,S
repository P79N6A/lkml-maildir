The big question is if there is a measurable difference in power consumption
from a reasonable default value.  I doubt it actually. The normal rule
of thumb is that if you average sleeps are long enough (and they still
stay this way even with the patch enabled) you're doing ok. If there is 
no or not significant penalty there is no reason to not enable it by default.
