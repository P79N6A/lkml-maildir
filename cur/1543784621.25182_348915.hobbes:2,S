Ok, here's the broken-out version.  I haven't yet found a good  
patchbomb script,
so until I do, I've got the broken-out parts on the web here:
http://zeus.moffetthome.net/~kyle/patches/convert-assembly-to-assembler/
The file 000-convert-assembly-to-assembler.diffstat in that directory  
has the
diffstat.
And once again, my 650MB upload limit applies, although so far I  
haven't even
come close, so it's not that big an issue, really...
PS:  If you have a nice patchbomb script with support for CC-ing  
individual
maintainers, numerical patch numbers, etc that you're willing to send  
me, I
would appreciate it a lot!
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
