Yes, but I understood (perhaps wrongly) that we were discussing the
shutdown path. Nevertheless, for rebooting, you don't want to simply
freeze the queue - you want to flush the queue and tell the drive to
flush too. For freeze, you may well flush the queue, but you might not
necessarily force the drive to flush its queue too.
