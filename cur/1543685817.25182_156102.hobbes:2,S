Hi Ingo,
I'm running into crashes in copy_mount_options with 
CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC and 4GB in 2.6.0-test3-mm1:
The functions in mm/usercopy assume that no exception handling is 
required if fs is KERNEL_DS. This is not true: at least the mount 
options copy and the i386 traps handler assume exception handling with 
fs==KERNEL_DS.
How should this be fixed? I don't see a simple, portable way to 
implement exception handling for the kernel address space.
