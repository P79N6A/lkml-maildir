In this case (struct ide_port_info) and probably few others having const
is important (maybe even more important than having __{dev}initdata since
majority of people use CONFIG_HOTPLUG=y) because it allows developers to
catch subtle yet hard to find bugs very early in the development process.
We had a few such cases in IDE - struct ide_port_info _template_ was being
modified because some quirk was needed for one version of the hardware which
was of course incorrect if another version of the hardware was also present
in the system.
Some other potential gains of using const like the better optimized code
or the protection of read-only kernel data are only an extra bonuses. :)
I agree that we need __const{dev}initdata but until then the workaround
that all __{dev}initdata must be const is an acceptable temporary solution
for IDE host drivers.
Thanks,
Bart
