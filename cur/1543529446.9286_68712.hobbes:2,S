Subject: compile problem with 2.3 and <sys/shm.h>
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

When some program include'd <sys/shm.h>, it fails to compile when shm.h is
from 2.3, not when it's from 2.2. I have a feeling this is because I use
libc5.
in /usr/include/linux/wait.h, it has an #ifdef __KERNEL__ on top of the
file.
Should that be removed, or should /usr/include/asm/semaphore.h contain one
too (more likely)?
Here is what I get:
