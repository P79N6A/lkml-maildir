No, I said they don't make a penny from Linux-AFS; they _do_ make
money off of AFS for other platforms.  Linux-AFS is a derivative work
from AFS, so the sources are still copyrighted by IBM and, indeed, the
Linux-AFS source tree contains the sources for all the other AFS
platforms as well.
It's a good thought -- I tried to go down that route.  I was happy
just to get IBM to allow me to distribute BINARIES for free!
