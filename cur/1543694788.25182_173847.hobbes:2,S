I experienced a fun problem where high-CFM fans in a 1u chassis caused
extreme vibration.  This vibration caused errors in the drive and
resulted in large numbers of failures using badblocks as a testing
tool.  When the vibration was removed the failures disappeared.  Another
symptom of the vibration was _very_ low disk performance <10% normal.
I couldn't get a straight answer from the drive manufacturer about how
the reallocation table worked.  The short answer was that they were the
only ones that could reset the reallocation table.
