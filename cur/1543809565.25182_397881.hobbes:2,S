here's what i have:
sudo /sbin/hdparm -d /dev/hdd
/dev/hdd:
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
sudo /sbin/hdparm -d /dev/hdc
/dev/hdc:
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
So it appears that both CDROM/DVDROM drives are using DMA, which
confirms what i was thinking (since the traceback i have is not the same
as the one Folker provided which clearly indicates that it happens
during a pio operation ).
