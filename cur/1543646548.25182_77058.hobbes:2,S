Hello,
I recently downloaded the most recent version of the developer's branch of 
the linux kernel tree (2.5.40). Trying to configure it, I encountered an 
error:
In case this matters, the 2.5.40-source-tree was downloaded as .tar.bz2 from 
the german mirror of kernel.org (ftp.de.kernel.org) and extracted to 
/usr/local/src/linux-2.5.40 with a symlink at /usr/src/linux
I tried to configure the source tree as root.
Now for the error I got:
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:
 Q> ./scripts/Menuconfig: MCmenu74: command not found
Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also
send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>.
Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the error tells me to report to you, I hereby do so. 
Have a nice day,
Benjamin Walkenhorst
