 But is it a design limitation or is it just that other UART drivers have 
to be modified to work with this option?  My point is if the former, then 
the option should be something like "console=8250" (the right-hand side 
being the name of the driver involved; others may want to add support for 
other drivers).  If the latter, then it's fine as is as other UART drivers 
may be wired to this code as a need arises.
