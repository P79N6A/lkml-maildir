There has been a real flame war on using threads in mplayer -- it ended in 
a fork into mplayer-xp. Surprisingly, the problem is not mplayer. Using the 
OSS kernel modules instead of ALSA, audio may drop, but it does not _skip_ it.

Is there a way i can prioritize mplayer to get disk i/o done first?
