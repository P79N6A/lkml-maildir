OK, that's what I thought you were saying.

I don't actually see your distinction here between those two environments;
why does it matter if there is one non-priveliged user or many?

I think it might depend on how strict the users starting point is;
you could say:
   1 This document editor can read and write any part of the users home
     directory other than the . files.
or you could say:
   2 This document editor can read any files but only write to the
     'Documents directory'.
If the adminisrator set something up with (2) as the starting point it
would seem reasonable for the user to be able to add the ability to edit
documents in extra directories for their style of organising documents
they work on; but they would be restricted in what they could add
so that they couldn't add the ability to write to their settings
files.

Well that would correspond to case (1) above; where the global settings
by an administrator were fairly open and then it was up to the user to
restrict programs more if they knew they always stored their documents
in one place; I was working on the basis of allowing applications
access to very little until you said it was alright - since most users
wouldn't actually bother up setting up more restrictive access.

That solution might answer my questions anyway.

Allowing a user to tweak (under constraints) their settings might allow
them to do something like create two mozilla profiles which are isolated
from each other, so that the profile they use for general web surfing
is isolated from the one they use for online banking.
