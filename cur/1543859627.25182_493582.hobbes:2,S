kevent is being considered for inclusion, but there is no need to get 
impatient.  Once kevent code stops getting revised rapidly, Andrew 
Morton can pick it up for -mm, for wide dissemination, testing and 
review.  After that phase, it can be pushed to mainline.
The feeling I get from other kernel hackers is that you are demanding 
inclusion "now! now! now!" rather than giving all stakeholders a chance 
to give input, and let your design sink into the collective brain.
This isn't just an optional feature but a key new addition to the 
kernel.  So we should intentionally take more time and consideration 
than normal.  We don't want to go back and have to change fundamental 
kevent details due to design flaws, we want to get it right.
