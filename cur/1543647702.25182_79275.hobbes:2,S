Fair comment.
The words are actually 'quoted words', so maybe:
 qword_add
 qword_addhex
 qword_parse  (or qword_get) 
 would be better.
The caches are for caching user-space-sourced information (IP ->
hostname, export options, uid->username etc) so maybe
  ucache_*
though that is a bit bland....
  uss_cache_*
(for the trekkies)???
