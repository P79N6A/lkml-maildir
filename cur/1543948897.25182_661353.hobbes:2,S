That would just spin waiting an ack (just like the smp-tlb-flushing
invalidates in numa already does).
Thinking more about this, we could also parallelize it with an
invalidate_page_before/end. If it takes 1usec to flush remotely,
scheduling would be overkill, but spending 1usec in a while loop isn't
nice if we can parallelize that 1usec with the ipi-tlb-flush. Not sure
if it makes sense... it certainly would be quick to add it (especially
thanks to _notify ;).
