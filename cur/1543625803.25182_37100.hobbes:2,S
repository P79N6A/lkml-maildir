Alan,
I suspect I'll hear from Juan on this. And I am going to look at your
code...
I realize it will be hard if I start from scratch. Since I was planning to
do it in 2.5.x it will be easier for me to learn how to avoid the problems
that plague the older versions.
Matthew

will need assistance with the packet-writing support. I am only planning to
do this for the 2.5.x and later kernels, so if anyone else wishes to
back-port it to an older kerenl series, by all means do so. I have wanted to
make some kind of contribution to this project for some time and I feel that
this is something that will be useful.
