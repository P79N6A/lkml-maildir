I think you are dreaming.  You've gone from wanting enough information
to supposedly debug your source tree to being explicit about wanting to
recreate the entire BK history in a different system.  The former is a
reasonable request, I suppose, but the latter is just a blatent request
for us to help debug and stress test a competing system.  
The answer is no, that's a clear violation of the license.  The deal is
that you get your data and you get *your* metadata.  Not the metadata
created by BitKeeper.  You get what bk export -tpatch gives you, the
diffs and the checkin comments.
I'm quite unhappy you keep asking for this, it forces me into the
position of being the bad guy.  You need to understand that we can
only take on so much risk and giving you BK for free was a huge amount
of risk.  Giving you BK, and the right to use it to create a different
system, and/or the right to use the BK metadata to create a different
system is way too much risk.  I'm sorry but we have to draw the line
somewhere.  Could you please just obey the license and stop this 
thread?  Is that so hard?  I don't come here every month and ask for
the GPL to be removed from some driver, that's essentially what you are
doing and I think pretty much everyone is sick of it.
