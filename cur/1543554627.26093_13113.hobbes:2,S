Changing the command line is not an option.  Kernel 2.2 still runs with
modutils 2.1.121, changing the request_module command line would break
people using modutils 2.1.121 and force them to upgrade, AC would kill
me.  I needed a mechanism that would work with modutils 2.3 but have no
effect on modutils 2.1.121, remember that 2.1.121 does not have this
security exposure.  It also had to work on 2.2 kernels because many
people are using moditils 2.3 on 2.2 kernels.  SGI ship a 2.2 kernel
with devfs for their big machines, that needs modutils 2.3.

I thought about that but it assumes that users will add that line to
their scripts - not guaranteed.  The fix needed a change that would
automatically detect that safe mode was required and not rely on manual
intervention.  Especially with 30+ Linux distributions out there.
