No that's not the correct history. The correct history is that 
I intentionally rejected this patch because the old k8topology
hack should really not be used anymore on modern machines (especially
not on Quad Cores). SRAT is the far better way to handle this problem
because it has a proper abstraction.
The problem with k8topology.c is that it needs to know very low level
information (like HT node numbers etc.) the kernel should not really
need to know and which are difficult to handle generally without
motherboard specific knowledge. 
k8topology.c mostly guesses, which was never a good way to handle this. 
Also in in the various "node has no memory" cases it needs quite
hackish fallback heuristics which will be always fragile. Then there
are some ugly interactions with quad cores. And some other issues
I still think the patch a bad idea because adapting this file all
the time is a long term maintenance issue. I can say that as 
the original author :-) It was just a quick hack long ago
to get NUMA going early. But now it far outlived its usefulness
and adapting it to modern machines is the wrong direction. 
Best is to phase k8topology out.
