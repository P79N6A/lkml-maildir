I am using the 2.4.0-test10 kernel. I have a sound blaster 16 which
works fine under 2.2.17.
I see that a while back someone posted on this problem previously but
there were no answers I can find..
Is support for soundblaster16 ISA broken in the 2.4 kernel? Compiled in
or used as a module I can not get it to work. I have passed sb=220,5,1,5
during boot when compiled in and also sent those during insmod.
When I boot to 2.2.17 these are the correct values and sound is happy :)
I am subbed to this group so you may answer here so this is on record.
Thanks much...
