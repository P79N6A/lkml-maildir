  I think it's the reason. But I have to decreased memory from 4G to 2G
because of the complain from my customers, so I can't give you the
/proc/meminfo or /proc/slabinfo now. :(
  Why the linux-vm can't manage lowmem correctly? I have seen some
articles talking about the LRU pre zone patch, but why 2.4.19+rmap14a
patch also has this problem?
