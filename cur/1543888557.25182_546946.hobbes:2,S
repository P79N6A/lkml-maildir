We should talk about unifying it with my lockstat work for -rt so that
we have a comprehensive solution for the "world". But you know that
already :)
Unifying lock initializer hash key initialization functions is a key
first step to that. Keep in mind, we can do more with this mechanism
than just kernel locks and we should probably keep that open and not
code into a corner.
