Ok, a fair request and I can not currently cite the part of POSIX requiring
the behaviour I describe.
On the other hand, as Jamie.Lokier@cern.ch explained:

Your reasoning would mean that we can implement `additional syscalls' 
linuxstat(), linuxopen() and linuxreadlink() which `provide slightly
more information', e.g. by not at all looking at permissions.
Of course we can, but should we?
