Well, here is some feedback. I have been using this patch for quite a while 
now without any problems what so ever. Including "make -j bzImage" on a 
dual cpu machine and normal use of a productions system. - Frequent crashes 
during ntfs development (and hence frequent reboots + fsck) have not shown 
up any problems in ext2 + this patch, either. - It seems to be stable all 
right on two different PCs (one SMP, celeron and one UP, pentium 133s).
Best regards,
Anton
