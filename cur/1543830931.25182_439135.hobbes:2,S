Hello everyone !!!!
Basically the thing is this: I need to build a cluster using openmosix
what I have is :
       Distro: Gentoo 2006.0
       Kernel: 2.4.32
       HW:      Pentium IV  3.20 Ghz  intel  chipset 945G (ICH7 family)
       HD:       SATA 
But for openmosix I need 2.4.26 kernel which doesnt support SATA, so I 
used it  and pacth it with the 2.4.26-rc1-libata3.patch but this patch 
doesnt have the support for my chipset.
The question is there any pactch with the most recent update for libata 
for this kernel or how can I add support to my kernel with libata with 
support for the Intel PIIX driver
Thanks in advance
