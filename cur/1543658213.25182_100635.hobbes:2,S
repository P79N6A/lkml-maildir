according to strace quotaon freezes at
quotactl(0xff800002, "/dev/hda1", 2
call trace is: (sysrq-t)
vfs_permission
__rwsem_do_wake
rwsem_down_read_failed
module_put
dqinit_needed
vfs_quota_off
resolve_dev
d_free
deny_write_access
check_quotactl_valid
d_free
scheduling_functions_start_here
do_quotactl
system_call
Btw, freeze on quotaon is not regular. After some time that system is up,
quotaon reports only no such device and terminates.
so looks like
1) freeze on quotactl
2) reports no such device
in both cases not working.
