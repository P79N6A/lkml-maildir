Hi,
I missed seeing this problem before, sorry about that. Thanks for the
link below, I now understand the problem.

I am trying to think out loud as to what the root cause of the problem
might be. In one of the discussion threads, I saw utime going backwards,
which seemed very odd, I suspect that those are rounding errors.
I don't understand your explanation below
Initially utime = 9, stime = 0, sum_exec_runtime = S1
Later
utime = 9, stime = 1, sum_exec_runtime = S2
We can be sure that S >= (utime + stime)
If S2 = S1 + delta, then as per our calculation
Initially
utime_proc = (utime * (S1))/(utime + stime)
           = nsec_to_clock_t(9 * S1 / 9)
later
utime_proc = nsec_to_clock_t(9 * S2/10)
Given that S >= (utime + stime), we should be fine.
The only problem I see is with rounding, like I mentioned before at two
places
1. Rounding at do_div() in task_utime()
2. Rounding in conversion from clock_t_to_cputime()
I have tried and not had any success reproducing the problem, could you
please help me with some pointers/steps to reproduce the problem?
