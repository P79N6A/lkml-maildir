I'm not sure if I have via686 or not.  Various tools like lspci don't 
seem to reveal much.
That's one of the problems I keep running into with Linux.  There aren't 
good tools for finding out what you have, and even when you do find out 
what you have, it's hard to figure out which modules you need, because 
the module names don't correspond well with the chipset name. 
Furthermore, there doesn't seem to be a good way to relate module names 
with menuconfig entries.  When someone says to use xyz module, I can't 
figure out which menuconfig option to select, so I have to compile ALL 
of them as modules, and when someone tells me to use a given menu 
option, I can't figure out which module corresponds to it.

Well, I have a module snd-mpu401, but when I modprobe it, I get an error 
about a non-existant device.

Ah, well, I had nightmares trying to use ACPI.  I use just APM for 
things like power-off (power-off works with APM, but not with ACPI). 
Maybe some of the experts can help me to figure out how to get it all to 
work.
I'm about ready to give up on ALSA and go back to OSS.  Maybe someone 
can help me to figure out how to get MIDI sequencing to work with OSS 
instead.  OSS would at least do audio right without noise and popping 
sounds, etc.
I apologize for the impatient nature of this post... I've been 
struggling for weeks to get audio working right with ALSA, but every 
piece of advise I get seems only to make things worse.
 From what I read on various web sites, ALSA for via82xx is so buggy 
that it's really not worth using yet.
