Well, after happily copying about 25 GB worth of data between IDE drives
with 2.3.99pre2(non-prepre) thinking that 2.3 had all corruption problems
fixed, I found that I was mistaken. :)
This time it seems to be different than before...Corruption is starting
on non-1024-byte aligned boundaries, which is strange.
Attached are two text files (gzipped to reduce size), the first is the
original and the second is the one is the corrupted one (overwritten with
kernel data).  Hmm...I wonder why I always see things overwritten with
kernel data...I must have a lot of copies of the kernel. :)
I'll do some more filesystem thrashing and see if I can reproduce it
easily as before, and if so, I'll do some binary searching again...
