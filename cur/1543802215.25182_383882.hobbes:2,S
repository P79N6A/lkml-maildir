One thing I forgot to mention was that 2.6.11.3 had the problem too when
I reverted to it.  I remember now that the person who made the debian
bug report for this said it only happened with a 64-bit userspace - and
I switched from a 32- to 64-bit userspace when I did 2.6.11 -> 2.6.14
(and I'm too lazy to switch back).
To get the backups back, I just ran a recent kernel with
try_direct_io=0.  If there's nothing further for me to test at this
time, I guess I'll go back to doing that until there's something to try.
Is that OK?
