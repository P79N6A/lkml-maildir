Mmhh... Just remember gcc 2.96.x is NOT a regular gcc release, you can 
check at:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/releases.html
AFAIK, it is a RH-hacked pre-3.0, which is probably not the best thing 
to use for anything.
The 3.x series are know to generate pretty slow code, anyway. So I bet 
your experience is pretty normal. I still stick with 2.95.[34] for x86 
kernel compile, although I'm using 3.0 for all purposes on Hitashi SH, 
as only gcc>=3.0 correctly supports the sh4.
