Historically, some people have actually used horrible hacks like trying to 
figure out which particular C file gets miscompiled by basically having 
both compilers installed, and then trying out different subdirectories 
with different compilers. And once the subdirectory has been pinpointed, 
pinpointing which particular file it is.. etc.
Pretty damn horrible to do, and I'm afraid we don't have any real helpful 
scripts to do any of the work for you. So it's all effectively manual 
(basically boils down to: "compile everything with known-good compiler. 
Then replace the good compiler with the bad one, remove the object files 
from one directory, and recompile the kernel". "Rinse and repeat".
I don't think anybody has ever done that with something where triggering 
the cause then also takes that long - that just ends up making the whole 
thing even more painful. 
What are the exact crash details? That might narrow things down enough 
that maybe you could try just one or two files that are "suspect".
