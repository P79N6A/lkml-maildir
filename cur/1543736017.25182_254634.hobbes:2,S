In /proc, you mean /proc/<pid>/oom_pardon then?
I didn't see any other settings there, so I thought it might be the wrong 
place.
Or should it maybe be a multiline rule file in /proc/sys/net/vm/oom_pardon:
0:exe /usr/bin/vlock
+10:user jerry
+5:user bob:exe /usr/bin/vlock
+100000:user !thomas:exe /usr/bin/emacs
: separating fields and \: escaping it. Maybe skip "exe" and "user" and have 
fixed fields.
Then match the whole table for every task on OOM, setting the absolute badness 
if there's no +/- and change relatively if there is.
Don't exit on match, so the first two would both apply to jerrys vlock, giving 
it a badness of 10, and bobs would get 5.
And probably uid instead of username.
Hmm, or maybe this is overkill? But having it apply to every newly-created 
process before a daemon could have the time to apply badness via *ctl() on 
every new process would be nice.

Never! :-)

You gotta let the processes know who's boss.
