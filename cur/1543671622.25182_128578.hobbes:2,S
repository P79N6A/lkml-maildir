The most reliable way is to force a triple fault; load zero into
the IDT register and then trigger an exception. The linux kernel 
does that in fact for reboot and so far I haven't seen any machine failing
to reset yet.

If you don't trust reboot you can use something like (untested!).
Compile with -c and load with insmod. I'm pretty sure it will reset
your box.
#define MODULE 1
#define __KERNEL__ 1
#include <linux/module.h>
int init_module(void)
{ 
        static struct { 
                short limit;
                unsigned ptr;
        } desc = { 64000, 0 }; 
        asm volatile("lidt %0" : "m" (desc)); 
        asm volatile("movl %0,%%esp ; int $3" : "g" (0)); 
}
