Sounds like MOP on the old Vaxen. TCP btw isnt as heavyweight as people 
sometimes think. You can (and people have) implemented a simple TCP client
and IP and SLIP in 8K of EPROM on a 6502. There is a common misconception
that a TCP must be complex.
All you actually _have_ to support is receiving frames in order, sending one
frame at a time when the last data is acked and basic backoff. You dont have
to parse tcp options, you dont have to support out of order reassembly.
