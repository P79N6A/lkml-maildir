Feels fine here on 3GHz P4 (HT system on i875 with dual channel
memory, striped raid ST38013AS HDD's).  xmms haven't skipped yet
(X reniced to -10) and desktop switching is quick.  First time
typing might be a bit sluggish in gnome-terminal, but second/third
char is fine, and vim seems to load fast enough.  All this is
with a 'make -j24' for kernel (yeah, not really that realistic,
but thought I should give it a go) and make -j4 for xorg-x11 going.
A few load values is:
load average: 26.72, 15.99, 7.35
load average: 27.93, 19.48, 9.52
load average: 28.02, 19.64, 9.63
load average: 26.01, 19.36, 9.59
base_timeslice is 256 btw ...

Cannot say I can really feel this test.  That with 'make -j4' for
X have load:
load average: 2.74, 4.45, 5.98
where the last is still high from the make -j24.
