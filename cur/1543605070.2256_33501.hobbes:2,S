Subject: how to invoke canonical processing in kernel

I am trying to figure out the correct approach a porting issue I am
dealing
with and would appreciate any pointers.
I am working on porting one of our communication products which works on
a
variety of OSs including Solaris, AIX etc to Linux. Basically the
product
provides a raw and canonical terminal interface to the applications and
has been implemented in STREAMS framework.
I have downloaded the LiS - Linux STREAMS (implemented by Dave Grothe)
from gcom.com. The only problem is that it is does not have any support
for terminal I/O
subsystem. So the processing that was handled by the 'ldterm' module on
other OSs now has to be handled by the available line disciplines in the
Linux kernel. While browsing the source I noticed that the default line
discipline N_TTY is probably sufficient to do the job but I am not sure
of the hooks. I am wondering if I can invoke the default line discipline
somehow or would I have to implement the canonical processing all over
again.
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Puneet
