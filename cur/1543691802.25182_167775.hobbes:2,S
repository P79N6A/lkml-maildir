I think that if defkeymap.c_shipped were inadequate for German and French
then you already would have fixed it.  I don't have experience with those
keyboards but would guess that defkeymap.c_shipped is probably adequate for
loadkeys to load a working keymap for German or French.
We have already discussed the fact that defkeymap.c_shipped is not adequate
to load a working keymap for Japanese.  In order to be capable of loading a
working keymap, defkeymap.c_shipped needs patching.  This is why the patch
looked so big.  Of course a working defkeymap.c_shipped should be generated
automatically from a different keymap file which doesn't need nearly as big
a patch.  Nonetheless defkeymap.c_shipped is part of the kernel, isn't it?
No matter how what method and how small an originating patch are used in
getting this one fixed, it is a part of the kernel that is getting fixed
here, isn't it?

It is that plus more.  It includes limits that prevent certain keymaps from
getting set when loaded.
