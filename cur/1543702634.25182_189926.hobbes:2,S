P4-3066HT with 1GB mem
Compiling the kernel under 2.6.1-mm2, gcc-3.3.2
(same messages as under 2.6.1-rc1-mm1, re-tested),
arch/i386/boot/setup.S: Assembler messages:
arch/i386/boot/setup.S:165: Warning: value 0x37ffffff truncated to 0x37ffffff
but compiles.
Rebooting with this kernel (2 times tested)
then trying to recompile the kernel,
no crashes as with 2.6.1-rc2-mm1.
Every time using the last compiled bzImage.
Mario, _not_ in lkml.
