This was just a quick and dirty fix to prevent root in a vserver from
breaking out into the "real server", that's it. chroot() inside a
vserver works exactly the same way as without vservers.
One negative sideeffect is that root in a vserver can't access any
directory with all 0s in the permission bits. But that's better than
having root in a vserver being able to go out into the "real server".
I'm not saying this is a very good solution but I think it at least does
what it's supposed to do in a dirty way.

Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level, then beat
you with experience.
