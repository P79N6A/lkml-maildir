hm, have you actually tested CFS before coming to this conclusion?
CFS is fair even on SMP. Consider for example the worst-case 
3-tasks-on-2-CPUs workload on a 2-CPU box:
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
 2658 mingo     20   0  1580  248  200 R   67  0.0   0:56.30 loop
 2656 mingo     20   0  1580  252  200 R   66  0.0   0:55.55 loop
 2657 mingo     20   0  1576  248  200 R   66  0.0   0:55.24 loop
66% of CPU time for each task. The 'TIME+' column shows a 2% spread 
between the slowest and the fastest loop after just 1 minute of runtime 
(and the spread gets narrower with time). Mainline does a 50% / 50% / 
100% split:
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
 3121 mingo     25   0  1584  252  204 R  100  0.0   0:13.11 loop
 3120 mingo     25   0  1584  256  204 R   50  0.0   0:06.68 loop
 3119 mingo     25   0  1584  252  204 R   50  0.0   0:06.64 loop
and i fixed that in CFS.
or consider a sleepy workload like massive_intr, 3-tasks-on-2-CPUs:
  europe:~> head -1 /proc/interrupts
             CPU0       CPU1
  europe:~> ./massive_intr 3 10
  002623  00000722
  002621  00000720
  002622  00000721
Or a 5-tasks-on-2-CPS workload:
  europe:~> ./massive_intr 5 50
  002649  00002519
  002653  00002492
  002651  00002478
  002652  00002510
  002650  00002478
that's around 1% of spread.
load-balancing is a performance vs. fairness tradeoff so we wont be able 
to make it precisely fair because that's hideously expensive on SMP 
(barring someone showing a working patch of course) - but in CFS i got 
quite close to having it very fair in practice.

i'd first like to see a demonstration of a problem to solve, before 
thinking about more complex solutions ;-)
