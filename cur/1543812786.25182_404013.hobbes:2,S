No you're not, it's broken. However, I think you're forgetting to reset 
cachep->num when we go over MAX_GFP_ORDER, no? This patch boots although 
I don't hit offslab limit.

[PATCH] slab: fix offslab_limit in calculate_slab_order
From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org>
The commit "[PATCH] slab: extract slab order calculation to separate
function" broke offslab_limit handling:
  - We should check for num instead of cachep->num because the latter
    is the number of objects for the _previous_ gfp order.
  - After hitting the offslab_limit, we need to correct gfporder and
    calculate left_over and cachep->num for that before exiting. We
    do this by keeping current state in local variables and previous
    state in cachep.
Linus spotted the problem and wrote the patch. I fixed gfporder
resetting when we go over MAX_GFP_ORDER and tested it with UM.
