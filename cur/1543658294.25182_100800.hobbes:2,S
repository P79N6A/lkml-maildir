Yes, but where one exists we can use it. Any recent SCSI disk should end
up with a unique value in (what is currently) sdev->name. We can tell if
the id sdev->name should be unique by looking at the first byte (it is not
unique if the value is 'Z', SCSI_UID_UNKNOWN).

The scsi_device, whatever it represents. For removable media, we should
either make sure sdev->name has a value for this storage such that we know
the id is not unique, or we should check (and export to sysfs) the
sdev->removable flag. I haven't checked what currently gets put into
sdev->name for CF cards (or even if removable is properly set).

For use with device naming/persistence.
For devices with a unique ID, we can always give them the same name;
non-unique ID's can be named based on their location
(host/channel/target/lun).
