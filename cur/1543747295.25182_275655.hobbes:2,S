You call _that_ specific?
Hell no. You need to do it without breaking existing uses, as noted 
earlier, and it's not specific at all. "all user visible parts" is a big 
undertaking, if you can't make it smaller than that, then forget about it.
Basic rule in kernel engineering: you don't just rewrite the world. You do
it in incremental independent steps.
Any mtd-specific rewrite is obviously a go.
