comment "USB storage requires SCSI"
	depends on SCSI=n
That's also user visible and doesn't confuse the user later, why he can't 
deselect SCSI.
Abusing select is really the wrong answer. What is needed is an improved 
user interface, which allows to search through the kconfig information or 
even can match hardware information to a driver and aids the user in 
selecting the required dependencies.
Keeping the kconfig database clean and making kernel configuration easier 
are really two separate problems and we shouldn't sacrifice the former for 
the latter.
bye, Roman
