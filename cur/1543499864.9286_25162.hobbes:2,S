I've had this problem on and off with aic7xxx since 2.0.32 (when I first started using them). We mix-and-matched kernel versions and aic7xxx version for a couple weeks, until we
found a combination that was reasonably stable (that is, only doing this one per couple weeks or so)
I don't trust (pick one): (the hardware|the driver)
