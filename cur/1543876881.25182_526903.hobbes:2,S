OK, I guess this is an area where the kernel has its own standard.
(__start_<secname> and __stop_<secname> are the symbols automatically
inserted by ld if the section name is straight alpha-numeric.  It's
actually pretty cool for code where you want section boundaries without
writing a linker script).
Cheers,
Rusty.
