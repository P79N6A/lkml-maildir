Sure, but seems I need to ask again: What is the exact reason not to implement
the muticast message multiplexing/subscription part of the connector as a
generic part of netlink? That would be nice to have and useful for other
subsystems too as an option to the current broadcast.

That's still possible and the kernel usually doesn't care about unimplemented
alternatives. :)
