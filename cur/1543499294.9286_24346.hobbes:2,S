Yikes, was someone proposing *that*? I agree that partitions should
continue to be accessed through device files in /dev. UUIDs and labels
shouldn't change that. They should just provide a way of identifying
filesystems at fsck/mount time.

Umm, don't we already have a mechanism to throw the label/UUID data away
after some time? Buffer cache. mount/fsck/whatever reads the file system
superblock, and looks at the label/UUID/whatever. I guess the problem is
when you do a number of consecutive fsck/mounts and the superblocks get
flushed out by the amount of data that fsck reads.
And all "mount -L" does is basically
for partitions listed in /proc/partitions
   open the partition (/dev/whatever)
   lseek to superblock
   read superblock
   close
   strncmp to see if it's the right one
   if it is, mount it, else break
If you're using the Amiga RDB partition table, where there are partition
names in the rigid disk block, fsck/mount could just look at the rigid
disk block on its own to check partition labels. The kernel doesn't need
to get involved.
The only problem with these schemes for normal use is that mounting a root
filesystem is tricky. So initrd is necessary to use labels/UUIDs for
everything.
