I think I'm missing the point. How does adding new poweroff support fix
the sysklogd problem? AFAIK this is not related at all, new sysklogd is
needed for the %% and such things.
And in your version the last part about deconding of the kernel oopses
seems to be about the poweroff (grammatically), not about the upgrade.
This can be misleading as well.
