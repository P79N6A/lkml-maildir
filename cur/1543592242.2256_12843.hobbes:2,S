Preallocation is currently disabled in ext3.  Eventually I'll probably
get it going by adding a journal prepare-commit callback to allow the
filesystem to flush preallocation before committing.

Indeed; I'd need to keep 3 copies to make that work.  The state
machine just gets even uglier.  :-)  I thought about it and I might
still end up going that route.

The point is not just performance, but also cpu cost (which
preallocation definitely wins on) and on fragmentation if you have
multiple writers in the same directory.
Cheers,
