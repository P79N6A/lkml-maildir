We'll probably end up needing a similar mechanism for memory hotplug.
What I need is a mechanism that is exceedingly quick during normal
runtime, any maybe marginally slower during a memory remove operation.
We basically put three or so hooks into some crucial parts of the page
allocator to grab out pages which we want to remove so that they never
make it back into the allocator or out to the system.
Those hooks have to be _really_ fast at runtime, obviously.  In my
testing code, I always just added a page flag, but that's only because I
was being lazy when I coded it up.
