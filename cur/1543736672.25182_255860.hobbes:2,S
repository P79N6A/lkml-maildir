Thanks for forwarding this, James.  Rene, it would be useful for you
to submit bug reports to the maintainer directly, or even contact linux-scsi.
I don't have time to wade through the mountains of crap on linux-kernel.

When do these show up?  Are they at initialisation time or are they during
normal operation?  You report the dmesg from a 2.6.8 kernel, how does the
2.6.9-rc2 one differ?  Is the sym2 driver version 2.1.18j in both kernels?
