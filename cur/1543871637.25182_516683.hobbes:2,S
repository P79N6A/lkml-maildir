Depending on whether anyone wants it, and what features they want, we
could emulate the old syscall, and make a new restricted one which is
much less intrusive.
For example, if we can operate only on MAP_ANONYMOUS memory and specify
that nonlinear mappings effectively mlock the pages, then we can get
rid of all the objrmap and unmap_mapping_range handling, forget about
the writeout and msync problems...
