Not entirely "my" driver, I just updated it and got it to partially enumerate
on some hardware that's a bit too weak for "real work":
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=13335072&forum_id=45866
... and there's the separate issue of the spi_claim()/spi_release() API
to take over an entire bus.  Such an API could be used by other SPI based
interfaces; some in-system-programmers (including JTAG) need that same kind
of protocol tweaking hook for SPI.
