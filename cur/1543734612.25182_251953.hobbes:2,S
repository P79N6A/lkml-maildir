sparc32 is very legacy; in a quick IRC poll of sparc32 users there was
approximately zero interest in new filesystems and most users used nfs
and/or ext[23]. One should note that as these cpus are very slow and
the systems have very little RAM compared to modern ones, kernel memory
footprint and the cpu complexity of fs operations for small fs's is of
high importance. I really don't expect reiser4 to ever be runtime
tested on sparc32. UltraSPARC is another matter entirely.
