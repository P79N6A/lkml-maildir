I was just going to comment on this as well.  I cannot get this to work as
advertised on a homegrown system as well.
Even tune2fs -l | grep inode and ls -i .journal show it's still using the
same inode.
Actually, a quick look through the code, I can't see where e2fsck would
take measures to hide .journal.  At least not in 1.25.
