My primary issue with cpusets (from CPU isolation perspective that is) was 
not the fatness. I did make a couple of comments like "On dual-cpu box
I do not need cpusets to manage the CPUs" but that's not directly related to
the CPU isolation.
For the CPU isolation in particular I need code like this
int select_irq_affinity(unsigned int irq)
{
        cpumask_t usable_cpus;
        cpus_andnot(usable_cpus, cpu_online_map, cpu_isolated_map);
        irq_desc[irq].affinity = usable_cpus;
        irq_desc[irq].chip->set_affinity(irq, usable_cpus);
        return 0;
}
How would you implement that with cpusets ?
I haven't seen you patches but I'd imagine that they will still need locks and 
iterators for "Is CPU N isolated" functionality.
So. I see cpusets as a higher level API/mechanism and cpu_isolated_map as lower
level mechanism that actually makes kernel aware of what's isolated what's not.
Kind of like sched domain/cpuset relationship. ie cpusets affect sched domains
but scheduler does not use cpusets directly.

In a foreseeable future 2-8 cores will be most common configuration.
Do you think that cpusets are needed/useful for those machines ?
The reason I'm asking is because given the restrictions you mentioned
above it seems that you might as well just do
	taskset -c 1,2,3 app1
	taskset -c 3,4,5 app2 
Yes it's not quite the same of course but imo covers most cases. That's what we
do on 2-4 cores these days, and are quite happy with that. ie We either let the 
specialized apps manage their thread affinities themselves or use "taskset" to 
manage the apps.

Speaking of user-space API. I guess it's not directly related to the tiny-cpusets 
proposal but rather to the cpusets in general.
Stuff that I'm working on this days (wireless basestations) is designed with the 
following model:
	cpuN - runs soft-RT networking and management code
	cpuN+1 to cpuN+x - are used as dedicated engines
ie Simplest example would be
	cpu0 - runs IP, L2 and control plane
	cpu1 - runs hard-RT MAC 
So if CPU isolation is implemented on top of the cpusets what kind of API do 
you envision for such an app ? I mean currently cpusets seems to be mostly dealing
with entire processes, whereas in this case we're really dealing with the threads. 
ie Different threads of the same process require different policies, some must run
on isolated cpus some must not. I guess one could write a thread's pid into cpusets
fs but that's not very convenient. pthread_set_affinity() is exactly what's needed.
Personally I do not see much use for cpusets for those kinds of designs. But maybe
I missing something. I got really excited when cpusets where first merged into 
mainline but after looking closer I could not really find a use for them, at least 
for not for our apps.
