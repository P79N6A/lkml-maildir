Thank you for saying it.  This is what I have been preaching (quietly) 
for years -- command submission and synchronization (and thus, DMA/irq 
handling) needs to be in the kernel.  Everything else can be in 
userspace (excluding hardware enable/enumerate, of course).
Graphics processors are growing more general, too -- moving towards 
generic vector/data processing engines.  I bet you'll see an optimal 
model emerge where you have some sort of "JIT" for GPU microcode in 
userspace.  Multiple apps pipeline X/GL/hardware commands into the JIT, 
which in turn pipelines data and microcode commands to the GPU kernel 
driver.
