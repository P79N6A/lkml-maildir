Crap.
I was just about to test ext3 on a raid1 with 2.2.20pre.  Everything else
I've tried has worked great.
As it looks, this probably won't be fixed in 2.2, especially since the raid
patch won't be merged into 2.2 (as stated by Alan).
I'll just have to test 2.4 harder now.  2.4.x-ac has been pretty good
concerning swap usage, and performance on my workstations.  I hope 2.4.10
will merge those improvements.
