So we are in violent agreement :) From my point of view the merge
should start with the files in include/asm because common s390/s390x
headers would come in handy in the user space as well. The hack we
currently use is to move the s390 / s390x header into subfolders
and use a meta include file that reads in the one or the other
dependent on the compile options (-m31 vs -m64). E.g. for bitsops
this looks like this:
#ifndef __s390x__
#include <asm-s390/bitops.h>
#else
#include <asm-s390x/bitops.h>
#endif
