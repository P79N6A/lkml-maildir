Nonsense.
My 4-way compaq server disagrees with you. No ACPI on that
at all, and it has fully working APM, even in SMP.  Likewise,
I don't think I've ever seen a desktop without APM.
(modulo broken biosen).
IIRC, APM supported this since the arrival of ATX power supplies,
which was a _long_ time ago. 1996/1997 ?
