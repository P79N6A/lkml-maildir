I had these problems when I used an older BIOS.
Now I use X (4.0.1), an AGP video card (Matrox G400), the BX chip isn't
cooled, both processors are o/c, and I use the HPT366 controler.
So far not even one crash in over 2 months.
But I get lots of APIC errors in my /var/log/messages as usual.
For me this was a BIOS error I would say.
Unfortunately I can't restart the box to check which BIOS I currently use,
since it is used all the time :)
For more info regarding the BP6 I'd recommend
