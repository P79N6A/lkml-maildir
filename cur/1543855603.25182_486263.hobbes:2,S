Thanks, Acked.
This is not a problem for now, as the default window size is 8 blocks,
and we never shrink the window size.  But it could be a issue in the
future, if the reservation window could be dynamically shrink, when it
keep failing to create a new(large) reservation window, or we keep throw
away a just-allocated-window as the application is doing very seeky
random write.
