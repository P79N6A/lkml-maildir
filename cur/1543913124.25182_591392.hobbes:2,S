This changes the semantics a bit; previously "flush" would flush
anything pending but leave us in lazy mode.  This just drops lazymode
altogether?
I guess if we assume that flushing is a rare event then its OK, but I
think the name's a bit misleading.  How does it differ from plain
arch_leave_lazy_mmu_mode()?
