Are these critical realtime processes user-mode only, or do they
also execute kernel code?  If they are user-mode only, a much more
straightforward approach might be to have RCU pretend that they do
not exist.
This approach would have the added benefit of keeping rcu_read_unlock()
atomic-instruction free.  In some cases, the overhead of the atomic
exchange would overwhelm that of the read-side RCU critical section.
Taking this further, if the realtime CPUs are not allowed to execute in
the kernel at all, you can avoid overhead from smp_call_function() and
the like -- and avoid confusing those parts of the kernel that expect to
be able to send IPIs and the like to the realtime CPU (or do you leave
IPIs enabled on the realtime CPU?).
