Someone made a script not long ago to create four-letter aliases of all
arch commands. Instead of `larch star-merge' you type `lstm'. Does that
sound more like what you want?

Chose shorter names ;p

Funnily enough, {arch} lists _first_ in ls output here. That was the
idea behind the curly braces in the first place too afaik.

No it doesn't. Tom, the main author of arch, likes files starting with
`='. The rest of us are not so sure ;) Off the top of my head I cannot
think of any file users should have to touch wich have a name starting
with `='.

This is a known issue and is being looked into afaik.
I for one agree completely with this point.

Arch being a bunch of shell scripts:

Three-fields version names is being worked at IIRC.

Not true. Any merge will include patch logs for the merged-in patches.

have you looked at the --out-of-date-ok flag to commit? (not that I
understand why you would want to use that...)

This say it so much better than I can:
