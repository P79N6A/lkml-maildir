I gave up on the idea because it seemed dumb to me to basically duplicate
the MSS mixer handling that's already implemented in ad1848.c, but feel
free to change it.  The mixer code from opl3sa2.c in the 2.2 kernels is
probably a good place to start.  Remember that you have to worry about
extra mixer channels on the SA3 versus the SA2.
