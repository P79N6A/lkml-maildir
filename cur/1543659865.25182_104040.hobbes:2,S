Hi Jamie,
These are problems I haven't run into yet. All of the systems
I have stay nicely locked once they are in sync. It might be fun
to try this experiment if someone who has a system with this 
problem volunteered to test.
For systems where the cpu frequency may vary I like the idea of
still using the TSC but doing a software phase locked loop to 
synchronize it to another timer.  I believe that Linus suggested 
this as well.  At least he suggested an NTP like approach.
The code necessary to do this could detect properly synchronized
TSCs and avoid most of the work.
