Solaris also can't handle the problematic cases. One of the big problems
being that bus, target, lun (or controller, bus, target, lun) are not
actually constants in all cases.
On some Dell storage arrays for example the disks are
bus 0, target 0..4  bus 1, target 0..4 - until that is the cleaner
trips over one of the SCSI cables at which point it becomes bus 0, 
lun 0...9, live, while running.
An even more fun one is SCAM, although its a mostly dead nonstandard
thankfully. With SCAM you can get your devices changing target across
a suspend/resume.
BTW while I remember cdrecord has a bug with hardcoded iso8859-1
copyright symbols in it which mean your copyright banner is invalid
unicode on a UTF-8 locale.
