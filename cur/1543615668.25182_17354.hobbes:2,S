OK, thanks. But I found out that if you want to use remap_page_range on kmalloc'ed memory you need
to set the reserve bit first. Without it, it just doesn't work. When using the nopage method no
reserving is necessary.
What about my question regarding locking the mm spinlock table before traversing the page table (for
vmalloc'ed memory). Any ideas there ?
