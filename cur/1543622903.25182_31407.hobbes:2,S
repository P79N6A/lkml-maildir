   Unless the 802.1q code is built as a module.  It looks to me like if you
   unregistered the virtual interface and unload the 802.1q module, if another
   tagged packet is received tg3 will still call vlan_hwaccel_rx and deref
   tp->vlgrp which now points to who knows what.
   
Any time VLAN groups exist, the VLAN module should not be unloadable.
This is a hokey area of how the VLAN layer works and I intend
to fix it.
