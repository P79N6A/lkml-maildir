Hello
Still having this problem? I think you got dropped from our 
off-list-silly-ideas discussion (most of them mine :)
Below is a patch vs pre3 that have removed the problem for Justin Guyett,
but it is kind of wierd ... (sorry Justin, but it is :)
If you could try this vs 2.3.99-pre3, with and without the #if 1 and let
me know if it helps you too. And check your dmesg if you get the
"Descriptor %i's next_desc is 0!" message.
Also, you said K6-2/450. Any overclocking of the bus or cpu?
(Just checking ...)
And if anyone else are reading this and ...
... has the same problem with 2.3.99-pre3 please test&report.
... have good ideas on why a value that was just written is no longer
    there, except if you add an if or printk then the value written
    "stays" written.
    The card doesn't yet know the address of np->rx_ring, nor does it have
    any interrupts enabled. The data was allocated using
    pci_alloc_consistent (__get_free_pages).
The np->dirty_rx should be there (I forgot to put it back when putting
some other things back as they were), but shouldn't affect this problem.
If the patch below doesn't work, try removing the "np->rx_ring[i].next_desc ="
inside the if statement, leaving just the printk.
Thanks.
