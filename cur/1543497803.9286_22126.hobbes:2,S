This suggests a cool ld hack.  gcc apparently uniquizes
strings in the compile stage, so I suppose it could make a list
list of string constants (it probably already can), that could
be uniquized at link stage.  See the '-fwritable-strings' option in
the gcc man page.  This would be useful in general, not just for
the kernel.
Food for thought:
$ objcopy -O binary -R .note -R .comment -S /usr/src/linux/vmlinux
$ ls -l /usr/src/linux/vmlinux
-rwxrwxr-x   1 ds       ds        1128448 Jun  4 18:01 vmlinux
$ strings -n 5 /usr/src/linux/vmlinux |wc
   6817   17886  129719
$ strings -n 5 /usr/src/linux/vmlinux |sort|uniq|wc
   5819   16180  118741
Savings of about 10k, or about 1%.  Not too shabby, since it would
be automatic.
