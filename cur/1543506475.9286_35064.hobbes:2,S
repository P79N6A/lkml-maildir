	I suggest people to *stop* this thread now.
	Write DaveM and me privately, if you think you have something
	to offer that our trick repertoire already doesn't have, but
	all talk at this thread has been repeating same few themes.
	(Like they were present the last time around too ...)

	Some long-overdue updates are necessary, but nothing very
	radical.
	However infrequent the attacks are, they are very annoying..
	One list at VGER got killed as a result awhile ago:
		linux-c-programming
	Same won't be allowed for linux-kernel.

	The perpetrator was/is US resident, and that "prank"
	got Rutgers University people quite upset also.
	I suppose "frying" perpetrators internet access is
	the least that will happen...

	The omnipotent ( = root ) people at VGER are around nearly
	24h a day - and being around the globe, we don't sleep at
	the same time.  We also have a few tricks to get early
	warning alerts quickly to ourselves.
	(The system MTA has high-priority channels towards us,
	 among other mechanisms we exploit..)
	There are certain conferences during which this instant
	reaction response is degraded, of course...
