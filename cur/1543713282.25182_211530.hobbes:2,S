This shouldn't be a problem 'tho, since we don't allow for spaces in
args, and we do find where the next space is, and ensure it's still a
space after the call (because console can splice up the command line,
but we'd skip over those bits anyhow).

pci= will clobber as well, which is why I thought I asked Andrew to drop
that part of the i386 patch (but perhaps I forgot, and with Rusty's
patch, it becomes a non-issue again).
