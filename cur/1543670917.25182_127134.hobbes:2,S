Nice. I wonder if there is some open-source project with aim in building
audit tool based on that idea. It will be very nice to have one, and I 
think it will be very interesting, especially for corporate users. I 
will search for information about this, and if I find nothing, maybe 
this is a good moment to start that project? The aim will be building 
kernel driver + user-space tool to provide 1) ultimate filesystem audit 
tool, 2) user space access control manager. This will help linux to 
conquer with proprietary products.
What you're thinking about it?
Leonard,
