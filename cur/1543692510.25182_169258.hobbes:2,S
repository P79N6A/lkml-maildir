I posted it once or twice then got busy.  It's an array of pages.  Rusty has
it, but didn't believe me when I said Linus wouldn't let vmalloc() fly.

I'd be ok with the simplest "kmalloc or too bad" version, but our customers
wouldn't.
My version uses a struct group_info which has an array of pages.  The groups
are sorted and bsearched, instead of linear.  The perfomance is quite good.
An older version against 2.6.0-test1 or something is attached.  If this
method will fly, I'll take some of Rusty's good ideas and finish this
version of it..
Linus?
