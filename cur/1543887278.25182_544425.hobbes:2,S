erk, I see your point.  If a caller is calling this with preemption enabled
then the current thread might at any time migrate onto the target CPU,
causing the smp_call_function_single() attempt to fail.  So the effects of
that call are basically a random crapshoot.
Often but not always, any code which is hanging onto a variable called
"cpu" while preemption enabled is buggy.
So yes, I'd say that from a sanity-of-implementation POV and for general
defensiveness, we should require that the called of
smp_call_function_single() has disabled preemption.
What a crock.
