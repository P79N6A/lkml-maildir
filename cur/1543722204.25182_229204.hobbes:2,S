This clearly is not an option. We want the most trivial way of building 
external modules to continue working, no matter whether the kernel is using a 
separate output directory or not; with Sam's patch we get that:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=$(pwd)
We also want to build modules for other configurations; this is as simple as 
passing another path in -C. For example, in the SUSE setup this would give 
you a module for an i386 bigsmp kernel:
	make -C /usr/scc/linux-obj/i386/bigsmp M=$(pwd)
The environment variable proposal is worthless: Where on earth should that 
environment variable come from?

Jari, you have shown that you still didn't get it. Trying harder instead of 
badmouthing random people might help.
