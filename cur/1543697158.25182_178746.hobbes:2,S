I'm afraid not ;-). In our case there can happen two situations after
setting notification: 1) (normal) notification event that have to be
serviced 2) cancellation of notification - when thread which some time ago
set notification resigns from it. In general it is only important that we
need a possibility to "signal" userspace with 2 different values.

If I understand you in the right way - yes it is important. The very
simple situation - we have two futexes. One wakeup on first
futex happen between 5. and 6. On the futex number 2 never. Or after an
hour.
