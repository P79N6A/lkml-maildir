Please check it is OK.
[PATCH 3/10] try parent numa_node at first before using default v2
in the device_add, we try to use use parent numa_node.
need to make sure pci root bus's bridge device numa_node is set.
then we could use device->numa_node direclty for all device.
and don't need to call pcibus_to_node().
