Yes, this is exactly the part that upsets me.
Let me make it clear that what they do is probably legal.
Yet I personally am offended by their behavior.  You mean that I wrote a
substantial amount of code that makes your damn product even possible
yet I can't boot my very own kernel on your box?  Well, thanks a fucking
lot Tivo.
See, it's not about what you're allowed to do, it's about being nice to
people especially the ones that help you.
