Jim and Adam,
I recommend that you check out the smartsuite package described in
http://www.linux-ide.org/smart.html.
  It showed me that when a Maxtor
drive I recently purchased dropped from 40MB/sec to 1MB/sec throughput, it
was having an incredible number of "Hardware ECC Recovered" (SMART
attribute 195) events.  I guess some bit chunk of the magnetic media had
failed, in a way that still allowed the drive to recover all the data, but
so that the overhead of the requisite ECC was killing the throughput.  I
ended up returning it for a replacement.
Cheers, Wayne
