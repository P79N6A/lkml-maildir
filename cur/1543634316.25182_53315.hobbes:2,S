Thank you. I take it as a big compliment that people are
not only interested in rmap on other kernel versions but
able to read and understand the rmap code well enough to
be able to do so ;)

Interesting to see that both rmap versions have the same
performance, it would seem that swapouts are much cheaper
than waiting for a pagefault to swap something in ...

... though I definately agree with your analysis here.
I hadn't expected to give a quick rmap port without any
of the VM balancing changes to give a performance edge
over the virtual scanning VM and am surprised by your
results.

This changelog seems small enough for the code to be mergeable,
if it weren't for one last TODO item:
- pte_highmem support for -rmap

Thank you. I'm leaving for two meetings and a conference
in Canada later today, but I'll be back to work on rmap
for 2.5 from july 3rd.
kind regards,
Rik
