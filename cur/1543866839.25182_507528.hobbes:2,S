None of the platform/hwmon/led driver model code landed there yet, but it
should be available at:
http://repo.or.cz/w/linux-2.6/linux-acpi-2.6/ibm-acpi-2.6.git
 queue/waiting
eventually.  Note, I push a lot to that branch, and it is a stgit head, so
it gets rewond if a change that makes sense in an earlier patch shows up.
