Are you sure it was matroxfb and not DRI what changed? I do not know
about any changes... But in the past (2.4.x) if XFree would set videomode
through /dev/fbX while being invisible (but with controlling tty), nothing
would change on display, as only videomode for XFree's VT would change. 
Now when there is no such virtualization, XFree server can change videomode 
of your actually visible console by mistake, while your VT could still
cache its idea of screen somewhere. But it does not look very possible,
you would probably notice that display resolution changed behind you...
Anyway, can you try applying matroxfb-2.5.72.gz from 
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest
 to your tree (you can
enable only matroxfb after patching, no other fbdev will work) and retry
tests? Except other things it restores /dev/fbX behavior from 2.4.x
kernels. I have running XFree (Debian unstable, G550, gnome2, since last
week with metacity WM, with sawfish2 before) & VMware in the 
background while being at textual console all the time, and I see no 
strange rectangles on the screen...
