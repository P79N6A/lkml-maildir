At this point I, personally, am not aware of any.  However, after a careful 
review of libscg in preparation for the patch I promised you, I can see that 
it would be possible for the code to be rewritten so that just the linux 
section contains the various workarounds that might be needed.
With your refusal to even consider doing that I can see where some people get 
this idea (I myself was under this exact same belief until I began my code 
review in preparation for the proposed patch).
I am unsure if you refused to provide OS specific workarounds for known bugs 
in order to keep the code orthogonal,  or if you had another reason. But with 
the division of the various operating system specific pieces of libscg into 
seperate source files it doesn't make sense.

Of the two bugs you've reported, one only exists in a deprecated and soon to 
be removed module. I will try to fix the other one as soon as you can provide 
me with enough data that I can see exactly what is getting messed up where.
As to you wanting to be able to read the SCSI status byte and the actual size 
of the completed DMA... Those parts of the kernel are as close to a blackbox 
to me as any code gets. Perhaps you could provide information or ideas on how 
it could be managed?
