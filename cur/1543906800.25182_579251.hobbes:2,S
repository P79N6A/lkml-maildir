the detection order works pretty well, we don't do parallel detection yet, 
and when we do having parallel detection, but serial registration (in a 
defined order) will work.
yes, this can change across kernel version, but in practice it seldom 
does. having run linux on production systems since the 2.0 days (and on 
personal systems since before 0.99) there have only been a handful of 
times when the detection order has changed.

useing different names for the MAC based names, and providing both names 
at once would work very well.
