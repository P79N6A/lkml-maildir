Just putting priority inheritance on then in the running thread check
your priority, if it goes up then the waiting thread in really
waiting.
Then if you can release + get the lock again its non compliant.... no?
ie    pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol(pthread_mutexattr_t *attr, int
protocol); with PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT
comment:
As a rt person I don't like the idea of scheduler bounce so the way
round seems to be have the mutex lock acquiring work on a FIFO like
basis.
