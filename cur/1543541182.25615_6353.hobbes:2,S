Most of the pcmcia drivers have similarly structured initialization
and cleanup code, but if you look closer, you'll see that it is not
the same.

You did write this driver, right?
The Linux PCMCIA web site (pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net), and every
distribution of the pcmcia-cs package, includes the Linux PCMCIA
Programmer's Guide, which is 72 pages of API documentation, including
a walk-through of all the components of a PCMCIA client driver.  The
PCMCIA package also includes a heavily commented skeleton driver
(dummy_cs).

No, you can't.
But then regular ISA and PCI drivers don't support hot plug devices
that are configured dynamically.  There is a hot plug PCI interface in
2.4, that also works for CardBus cards, but so far only a few drivers
use it.  And the problems are still being sifted out of that.  For
16-bit PCMCIA cards, configuration is a lot more complicated than for
PCI devices.

For PCMCIA drivers, ACPI/APM is handled for you.  You just field
CS_EVENT_SUSPEND and CS_EVENT_RESUME events in your PCMCIA event
handler.

At the moment, no, you can't do that.
