Here's a cheap trick that I use to get rid of a lot of spam. What I do 
is set my highest MX record to a nonworking IP address. Spammers often 
start at the highest MX rather than the lowest figuring the highest has 
less spam filtering. And the spammers never retry. IO get rid of about 
120,000 spams a day with this trick.
