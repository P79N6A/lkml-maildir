It's great to see 2.2.0pre1 out, even though I havne't made 
it build on the Alpha sitting next to me (with ac1 applied, 
it dies somewhere in main.c).  But these are just 
inconveniences today.
I'd like to ask the list if there's any reason the 
arch/i386/Makefile includes "-m486" in the CFLAGS for the 
586 and 686 configurations.  Those of us using recent EGCS 
compilers (for instance) like to take advantage of the Pentium 
and Pentium Pro/II optimizations via "-mpentium -march=pentium" 
and "-mpentiumpro -march=pentiumpro", respectively.  It is my 
understanding that some of these optimizations are enabled by 
default, even if the compiler is not provided the "-mpentium" 
or "-march=" flags.  It's also my understanding that specifying 
the "-m486" option will explictly disable any Pentium or 
Pentium Pro/II optimizations.  This is not good.
While it's not too inconvenient to open up the Makefile and
alter it to include my options, I wonder how many people 
grab the latest EGCS, do a 3-stage compile with their specific
optimizations, and end up compiling a kernel for a 486 without
knowing it.  :)
It would be convenient for me to put the "-mpentium 
-march=pentium" flags in the 586 config (and likewise for 
686), but I recognize that older versions of GCC might balk 
at this.  That's fine.  I would like to suggest that the 
-m486 be taken out of those blocks, though.  Is this a bad 
idea?
