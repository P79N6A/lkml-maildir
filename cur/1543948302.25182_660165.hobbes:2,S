The actual whitelists still live in hal (or specifically hal-data),
rather than pm-utils.  /usr/share/hal/fdi/information/10freedesktop/20-video-quirk-pm-*
for example.  This gets passed down to pm-utils by hal.

Seems to be a debian specific change, the variant in Fedora, nor upstream
pm-utils doesn't have any of that.  Possibly because it's a dumb idea
to have two separate sources of the same information.

I'm not the gatekeeper of what goes into Fedora userspace, but I'm pretty
certain the path forward has already been decided.  Running a modern
Fedora desktop installation without hal just isn't feasible.
