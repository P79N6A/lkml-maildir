Is it possible to put some of this in a header file?  I think it may
make the driver look alittle nicer and IMO easier to read.  If this is
a problem or not just plain _stupid_ then just ignore me.  I'm not
trying to be nit picky, i just think this is a *great* driver and I'm
excited to use it, but the cleaner it is the more manageable it will
be in the future.
