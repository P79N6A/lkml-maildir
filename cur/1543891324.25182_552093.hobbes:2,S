> We must have a NULL pointer exactly because it cannot be dereferenced.
Well, both patch versions had NULL pointers - either pidarray or ctr->buf.
But now I can make more sense of what you say -- you -want- the pidarray
pointer, in particular, to be NULL, so that we don't accidentally use it.
Does that still mean that your patch suggestion was incomplete, in that
it lacked the additional checks to avoid using a NULL pidarray?
