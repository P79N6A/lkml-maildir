I wonder if we should consider adding:
	WARN_ON(!spin_is_locked(&tty_termios_lock));
in there.
However, the one annoying thing about "spin_is_locked" is that, on UP,
it defaults to "unlocked" which makes these kinds of checks too noisy.
Maybe we need a spin_is_locked() with a bias towards being locked for UP?
