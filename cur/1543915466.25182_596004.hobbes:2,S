We are having all sorts of stability issues with -mm kernels, let alone
perf testing :(
For now, we are trying to do slab Vs slub comparisons for the mainline kernels.
Let's see how that goes.
Meanwhile, any chance that you can point us at relevant recent patches/fixes
that are in -mm and perhaps that can be applied to mainline kernel?
thanks,
