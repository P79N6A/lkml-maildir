Hi!
Thank you for your reply!
I don't really understand how to use the output of ldmutil in order to
do the dmsetup... All the instructions are for ldminfo...
And the C++ dependency does not work well with uclibc... I tried to
compile this using uclibc++, but the exception handling of uclibc++ is
broken for some strange reason... And I don't wish to introduce the
overhead of the C++ libraries to my system...
If ldmutil contain all the information, I will backport this to C and
be happy... :)
Can you please tell me how you use the output of this utility to merge
a spanned partition on two separate disks?
