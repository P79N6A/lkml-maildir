Hi folks,
I don't know how to solve the following problem.
I have 2 IDE-HDD, 1 ATAPI CDROM drive, 1 ATAPI CD/RW writer
in my computer, and I want to connect a parport-ZIP-drive.
For both ATAPI CD-drives, I'm using the SCSI-emulation, they are
now /dev/scd0 and /dev/scd1. I'm using modules, and LILO
is appended "hdc=ide-scsi hdd=ide-scsi". As long as the ZIP
dive is not connected to the parallel port, all works well,
and I can roast CD-ROMs without problems.
But when I plug in the ZIP drive and reboot the computer, then
the ide-scsi configuration is ignored and the ATAPI drives are
seen as IDE. The ppa module is loaded and ZIP works, but I am
no more able to burn CDs.
Can anybody give me a hint, please? (x86-PC, Kernel 2.2.13)
Regards,
Gerry
