Ah I see. You're thinking of compressing the pages as we eat memory? I
guess I need to look at LKCD more closely. I think it can wait until we
get the basics of the expanded functionality sorted.

Of course that can be overcome too. The user simply starts swsusp
earlier or turns off compression if necessary.
Thanks for the thought provoking :>
