AFAICS, this is just a badly implemented Shellsort (the 10/13 increment
sequence starting with the number of elements is probably not very good,
besides swapping stuff is inefficient (just juggling like Shellsort does
gives you almost a third less copies)).
Have you found a proof for the O(n log n) claim?
I'd write as attached (careful, a local element on stack!)
