Erk, no wonder I had problems making it compile. I just assumed they 
were the same struct ifaddr and then tried to hack the code 
into using the glibc one ;)

in net/if.h
/* The ifaddr structure contains information about one address of an
   interface.  They are maintained by the different address families,
   are allocated and attached when an address is set, and are linked
   together so all addresses for an interface can be located.  */
