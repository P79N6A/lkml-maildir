The server has two processor, but the kernel is using just
one of them. This because of the problem we had with 2.2.7,
and also because we were not successful in compiling a
multiprocessor version (kernel panic on boot).
The current setup is quite stable. The configuration is as
follows:
An ICP Vortex RAID controller 6537RP
Three 9 GB DISKS
256 MB RAM
An Allied Telesyn Ethernet controller (required to connect
to 10 Mbit network which still exists).
We do had a lot of freeze. They were solved when we:
1) upgraded the on-board EtherExpress 100 driver
2) forced the on-board Ethernet to go on interrupt 10.
BTW: the /proc/pci reports that Video Card (CD 5446) is on
interrupt 255 (????)
Thank you for your answer.
