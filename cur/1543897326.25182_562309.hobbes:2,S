A similar cleanup is possible even for return probes then. I wonder if
there are any kprobe related scenarios where the executable code may
be located outside the core kernel text region (e.g, ITCM?). In that
case would it also be wrong to assume that the jprobe handler may be
situated outside the kernel core text / module  region? Would it then
make sense to move this check from register_jprobe() to the arch
dependent code?

Seems like you're checking for the jprobe handler to be within
kernel/module range. Why not narrow this down to just module range
(!module_text_address(addr), say)? Core kernel functions would not be
ending with a 'jprobe_return()' anyway.
