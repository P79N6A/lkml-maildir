   Is a bug report more useful for the user of a "system" or for the
   "system" itself ?
You can ask the same question about a patch, and my answer
is the same, "it depends upon the bug/patch and whether
the people it affects actually care about it".
What's truly "useful" for the "system" are things that allow
the people that maintain it to SCALE.  Lossless bug and patch
databases that force me to look at each and every item do not scale.
What you don't understand is that I, and most of the people who help
me, do this because I and they want to.  So as soon as things get
introduced that make us less "want" to do this you can be sure
contributions will slump slowly but surely to nothing.
