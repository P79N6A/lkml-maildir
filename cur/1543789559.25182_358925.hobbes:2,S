   Ok. I'll need to build a stock tree then.

   Nope.  Note that Node2 is iterated in the for_each_online_node, my
printk is within the body of the loop.  Also, the allocation it did get
is still from Node2.  My understanding is that goal for
alloc_bootmem_node is MAX_DMA_ADDRESS.  On ia64, that defaults to 4GB.
So it makes sense that we're using the second region in the
discontiguous space of that node.  This solution therefore relies on one
of the nodes having less than 4GB of zero base memory.  That's a pretty
weak assumption.  Thanks,
	Alex
