When I said "lower due to broken hw" I was more thinking about things like 
the SiIimage driver, which actually limits the rqsize to 15 sectors due to 
some strange hw interactions with seagate SATA devices.
(It will then raise it back up to 128 if it's not a Seagate SATA drive. I 
forget what the exact issue was. Some strange corruption in some limited 
case, and not allowing big requests worked around it. There's some 
strange IDE quirks out there...).
