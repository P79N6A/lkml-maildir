I was thinking about this over night and came to similar conclusions. 
I.e. for RT tasks it's really a problem of selecting the right CPU at 
wake up time rather than a general load balancing problem.  The solution 
that I thought of was different (though) and involved modifying 
wake_idle() so that when the woken task was high priority as well as 
looking for idle CPUs it looked for the one with the lowest priority 
current task and if it couldn't find an idle CPU it returned the one 
with the lowest priority current task.  The aim was to maximize the 
probability that the newly woken task went straight onto a CPU (either 
by finding an idle one or preemption).
Although aimed at this specific problem, this solution would also help 
smpnice to attain equal "average load per task" values for groups/queues 
which I think is a desirable secondary aim to equatable distribution of 
weighted load.  If both of these aims are met I think a natural outcome 
would be that the highest priority tasks are well distributed among the 
CPUs (but, as you imply, this would be a statistical trend rather than 
an deterministic).
In summary, I think that smpnice can be modified in ways that will help 
with this problem but if you need determinism then special measures are 
probably necessary.
