Well, there is more than one use case -> probably we need more than one

That's fine for the never-enter-a-password case, but for the 
suspend-case, it's not so good since i want to close the lid and pack 
away the notebook. Two scenarios, two implementations.

We could mask it in /proc/cmdline or think of other mechanisms for 
passing the secret. Or just ask from the initramfs and start resuming 
after that.

Well, as long as you need your entire $HOME or / encrypted, it's not 
easy. If you just need e.g. /secret/ encrypted userspace could umount it 
before suspend and remount it after resume (we also lock X etc, adding a 
umount / mount should be trivial).
