IMBMSB is the GFDL the 'Gnu Free Documentation License'?
Has Gnu produced a doc license that is incompatible with GPL?
Looks like it...but I can understand the purpose behind the
GFDL.
Seems like GNU needs a simple doc license a la BSD doc license
to fill the gap between a formally published doc 'GFDL' and the
sort of stuff in the kernel tree 'BSDish'.
