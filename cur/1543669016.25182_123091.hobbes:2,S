... patch deleted ...
that fixed it, but i only this second noticed the "-R" for reversing
the patch.  i applied it normally against my 2.5.66-bk12 tree, and
it apparently applied cleanly.  
wouldn't that suggest that that patch wasn't in my tree in the first
place?  i'm sure i'm up to bk12 at this point.
