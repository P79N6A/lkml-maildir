Yes, and the frustration of composing lengthy emails to bouncing (or worse 
still, silent) email adresses is severe if you just decided to for once not 
shrug about it but submit a bugreport. If it happens to an address from 
MAINTAINERS (and an LKML savvy user) the address can at least be deleted but 
you can't delete a MODULE_AUTHOR tag.
Without something like a MODULE_MAINTAINER I have no way of saying "ignore 
those MODULE_AUTHORs please, I want the bugreport".

Had a few Ays as well. But note, since you suggested removing MODULE_AUTHOR 
I actually agree that made more sense. It's just that iff that can't happen, 
I feel I need a place to override MODULE_AUTHOR for the use that I'm 
interested in and which is acting as the contact for a driver.

Tie Alan to his chair and take away his keyboard while we submit patches 
removing MODULE_AUTHOR? Or just apply a trivial two line, optional, non 
mandatory, patch introducing a MODULE_MAINTAINER? You pick... :-)
