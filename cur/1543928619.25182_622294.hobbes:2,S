I'm not disagreeing, but I've seen some very strange crap over the years
come from those closed source video drivers so I do not trust them at

If you can reproduce this without it loaded, please send the new oops
message to the linux-usb mailing list and the developers there will be
glad to work with you to track this down.
Oh, can you also reproduce it with 2.6.24-rc3?
