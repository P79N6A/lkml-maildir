But in a failover scenario you want two devices to have the same IEEE
(station) Address (or MAC Address or hardware address).  So many names
for the same thing!  
When the primary unit fails, you want the backup unit to completely
assume the failed unit's identity - right down to the MAC Address.  The
other way to do it using gratuitous ARPs is not good enough because some
cheap router someplace with an ARP cache of several hours will not
listen and will never update its own ARP cache.  
I like to think of this as bending the rules a little bit, not really
breaking them.  :)
