I am very happy to see that there is a project to take
care of the needs of people with older hardware.
If you ever need help on the kernel side, let me know.
I know a lot of friends in various countries who simply
don't have the money to buy a new computer. Granted, 64MB
isn't anywhere near a monthly salary for most of them,
but after paying their bills they still don't have enough
money left to buy a new computer (and if they had, they
should buy something else with it ... there really isn't
a good excuse on why software is getting this much more
bloated).
