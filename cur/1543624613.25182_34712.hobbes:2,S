I don't know of any IDE-related errata for the PIIX3 chip. At least
Intel didn't publish any and there doesn't seem to be any workarounds in
the original piix.c code, only a statement stating that the PIIX3 UDMA
is broken, however, as far as I know, PIIX3 isn't UDMA capable at all.
(Hmm, perhaps some BIOSes enable UDMA on PIIX3, that'd explain it ...
though I believe that's quite improbable).
In what way are those batches broken?
