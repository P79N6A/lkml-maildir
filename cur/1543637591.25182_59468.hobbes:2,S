I see.  I'm only getting the single, expected, reboot.  I have found that 
if I mess with the contents of /proc/acpi after resuming, the system 
freezes solid within a few seconds.  I see a patch in Linus' BK tree that 
looks like a possible fix for ACPI.  I'll test that in 2.5.29.  In the 
meantime, I can suspend to disk just fine however.

Sounds fair.  At least I can change it for my own use. :)

Yes.  Once memory fills up, I can't get enough free pages, but running a
userspace "eatmem" program in the script before suspending fixes that just
fine.  That also speeds up the suspnd/resume time.  The calls to
try_to_free_pages() don't go nearly far enough since the rmap VM stops
freeing memory once *it thinks* there are enough free pages. Being able to
tell it to ignore it's internal watermarks would fix this.

Neat, thanks!
