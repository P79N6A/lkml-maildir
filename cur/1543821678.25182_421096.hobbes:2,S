I'm just wondering how this will react with VGA devices being run by
fbdev or the drm, I know the DRM never calls pci_disable_device, as
the card might require the bars enabled so it can do VGA, and which if
it is your primary VGA card, can cause you all kinds of troubles...
(like losing text mode)..
Alan Cox mentioned this somewhere before in relation to video cards..
Dave.
