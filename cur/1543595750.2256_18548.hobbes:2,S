I check that the handler is not SIG_DFL, but perhaps my assumption that
any sigwaitinfo() user of a signal would set SA_SIGINFO and set the
handler to non-SIG_DFL is mistaken?

Requiring all libraries to use the sigopen() as you specified it just
isn't going to work, because you would have to make big changes to the
libraries.
Sometimes you actually do need SIGRTxxx signals to be delivered using
signal handlers!
Also as it was specified, you are reduced to reading one type of signal
at a time, or using select().  Often you wish to check several signals.
For example, in my programs sigwaitinfo() calls check for SIGIO, SIGURG
and SIGRTxxx at least.  Therefore siginfo(), if implemented, should take
a sigset_t, not a signal number.
The problem of when you actually want to receive an allocated signal
through a handler is, IMHO, best solved by permitting sigaction() and
signal delivery on signals that have been opened with sigopen().
However, it would be ok to require a flag SA_SIGOPEN to sigaction() to
prevent it from returning EBUSY.
