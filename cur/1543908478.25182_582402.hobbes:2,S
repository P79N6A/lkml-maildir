Anything that can be simulated with a Turing machine is *possible*.
The question is how many rocket boosters the pig needs for takeoff.
Hint: The thesis talks about why he didn't implement it for Linux.

Read section 5.2 of that thesis, particularly this quote from 5.2.2:
"For random word writes, this implies that SoftECC will need an order of
magnitude more compute time than the user-mode code"
Basically, on every single memory page that gets dirtied, we have to then
re-checksum the page (blowing away cache lines in the process).  If you want
to get a feel for it, find the kernel code that recognizes that a page is
dirtied, and just add a few lines there:
	int foo = 0, i;
	for (i=0;i++;<1024) { // adjust for non-4K pages
		foo ^= *(page+i);
	}
and see how much your system crawls.
Personally, I'd recommend just shelling out the bucks for hardware ECC if
the reliability matters.
