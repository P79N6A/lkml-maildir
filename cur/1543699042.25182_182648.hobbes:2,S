Please note that this fix only mitigates the bug: it can still occur,
but much less frequently. Before this patch, nfsd would loose track of
the lock (see the enclosed program at the beginning of the thread)
after a few (<5) kills. With the patch, it takes sometimes as many as
300~500 kills before the bugs manifests itself.
Trond, do you think I should push the patch to Marcelo, or should I
wait for a better fix? I don't think Marcelo would accept a partial
fix. I would try to fix it myself, but I have no clue on the inner
workings of lockd/nfsd.
Phil.
