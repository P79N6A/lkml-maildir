Hi,
Any ideas why the mousedev module does not load automaticly with 15-rc1-mm1?
With 14-rc4-mm1 all is ok.  With 15-rc1-mm1 I have no /dev/input which causes Xorg fun.  The 
mouse is connected to a usb hub and is detected when I unplug and replug it.  I used make oldconfig 
from a 14-rc4-mm1 config.  Dist is debian amd64 unstable and is up to date.
When I manually modprobe mousedev things work as expected
DRM works fine and dri is enabled.
Ideas,
Ed Tomlinson
