Will it work if radeonfb is compiled as module? I think I had problems
with that, but I'll try again.

Unfortunatly, the laptop doesn't have serial port. I tried to get a USB
device (pocketpc) read the USB serial, but I only partially succeeded. I
can pass console=ttyUSB0 to the kernel and load the ipaq serial console
driver as it oopses. I am able to echo strings to /dev/ttyUSB0  and read
them on the ipaq, but I am not able to "deviate" the kernel messages to
that port. Any hints on how to do that would be very appreciated, I
didn't find anything usefull on the web. (I tried with setconsole
/dev/ttyUSB0 but it gives error msg about device busy or something)
