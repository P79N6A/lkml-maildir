Yes, I waited a while first time.  No drive activity, no nothing.  Keyboard 
was still awake though, so it wasn't a 'crash' as such. The boot just stopped 
there twiddling it's thumbs...
Installing the latest udev though makes the machine boot so fast I can't see 
the 'initialising udev devices' message unless I scroll back to see in 
console.  I thought at first I broke it, and udev wasn't working at all now 
and was being ignored, but it is working just fine :-)
But remember, what got me was it boots fine on 2.6.11.12, insomuch I never 
really saw the udev message away and never had to investigate it before.
