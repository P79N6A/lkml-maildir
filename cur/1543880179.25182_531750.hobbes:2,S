I think it's equally intuitive if flags are not propagated.  After
all, I may want to set the mount flag _only_ on this particular mount,
and not anything else.
This is something I wouln't be sure about either way without
consulting the man.

I think not, it would just be another policy decision having to be
made in the kernel on an fs by fs basis, and getting it wrong would be
much worse than getting it wrong in userspace.
