I have had a long standing problem, I am not sure what the cause of it is, but
when i run:
/usr/src/linux# patch -p1 < linux-2.2.0-to-2.2.1-patch
or apply any other patch for that matter, it will not automatically create
files that dont exist. In stead I get this message.
-- cut here --
can't find file to patch at input line 22
Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?
The text leading up to this was:
--------------------------
|diff -u --recursive --new-file v2.2.0/linux/Documentation/proc.txt
linux/Documentation/proc.txt
|--- v2.2.0/linux/Documentation/proc.txt        Wed Dec 31 16:00:00 1969
|+++ linux/Documentation/proc.txt       Thu Jan 28 12:16:40 1999
--------------------------
File to patch: 
-- cut here --
So, all I do is run `touch linux/Documentation/proc.txt` in another window,
then type "linux/Documentation/proc.txt" at the File to patch: prompt, and it
continues, this is a big hassle for large patch files, and in looking at the
source it tries to create files that dont exist... Here is the version info
from the two systems that both have this problem.
glibc: 2.1
fileutils: 4.0
ed: GNU ed version 0.2
diffutils: (GNU diffutils) 2.7.2
patch: patch 2.5
and
glibc: 2.0.111
fileutils: 3.16
ed: GNU ed version 0.2
diffutils: (GNU diffutils) 2.7.2
patch: patch 2.5
This is the only problem I am currently having with my systems that I have not
been able to resolve, I have been developing a linux distribution for the
past four years, for the alpha and x86 architectures, using a LISP(scheme) 
based packaging system, I hope to release the distribution for further
development, in a fasion similar to debian, or release all of my patches to
debian once it functions properly.
To note, I have several patches to allow for the basic utility programs to
function under the Unix98 naming scheme...
