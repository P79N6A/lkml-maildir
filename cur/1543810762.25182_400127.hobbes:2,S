Ugh.  OK, well that makes FMODE_EXEC useless for the server, then.
It'd be nice to be able to give the server some way of enforcing the
deny bits.  Otherwise, though translating FMODE_EXEC to DENY_WRITE will
at least allow the nfs server to deny writes by other clients, it'll
still do nothing to protect against writers on the exported filesystem
(even local writers--nevermind the cluster case).
And an open flag is attractive since it gives at least some hope that we
might be able to do DENY_WRITE atomically with the open.  Samba
apparently just does the open and then tries to get a mandatory lock
afterwards, but that seems racy.
