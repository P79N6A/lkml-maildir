Hello.
This is the way VMware and probably other comparable emulators
access the devices.
Yes, sometimes you have to risk broken software in favor of augmented
security, but so far we only have broken software.
: Someone did actually have a demo of a small fs that allowed you to
: fiddle with the status but possibly the code could get smarter for
: "exclusive user of media". I'm not sure if that is worth it.
Do you have the name of the fs and/or the name of author?
Do we have a clear understanding that this fs would only
be a benefit if *All* the different ways to access the device would
use the same policy enforcement and consistently allow or
disallow certain operations regardless of the access method?
