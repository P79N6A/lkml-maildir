Hmmm, interesting problem.  Perhaps your idea of having drivers hold a
refcount for every device they control makes sense in this case, but
as you point out, it's a significant departure from current policy.
With "rmmod -f" it's not quite reboot time, though.
Anyway, I don't think this is a battle I want to fight 8)
Cheers,
Rusty.
