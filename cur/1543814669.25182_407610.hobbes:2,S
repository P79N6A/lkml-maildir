Actually I tried to use this model first. I hit on problems with and you 
said that I should avoid using the device model.
Unfortunately I cannot so far say what I'm writing. The below is a cite 
from my old mail which illustrates the sort of my device:
"In connection with this, I have a question. There is a whole bunch of
drivers which do not directly relate to hardware devices, but which
still want to expose their parameters via sysfs. For example, this could
be a filesystem, LVM, a compression layer on top of a file system of a
block device, whatever. These are "virtual" devices and they are not
physically connected to any bus. How should they deal with sysfs?"
