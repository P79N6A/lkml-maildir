We tried rebasing the kernel from 2.4.19 to 2.4.21 in a SLES 8 service
pack. It was like doing a new product.
Currently for SLES our policy is to add new driver support at Service Pack
releases.... Currently this list includes major updates to e1000 and other
Gigabit network drivers for instance (and likely other things, I am not
really keeping track).
So:
- SUSE Linux distro every 6 months with then current mainline, 
  24 months lifetime, kernel gets only critical bugfixes and security fixes.
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Line (every 18 - 24 months) with then current mainline,
  kernel version stays stable.
  Non Service Pack kernel updates:
  	- security and critical bugfixes only.
  Service Packs kernel updates:
  	- new features (but only with backing business case/ partner request)
	- driver updates for enterprise critical hardware
Ciao, Marcus (only responsible for the security part luckily)
