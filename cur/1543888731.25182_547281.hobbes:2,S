It was about how much time I wasted replicating work that I didn't know
about. Some folks have different communication styles and it isn't ment
to be anything further than that.
Me and Peter are talking about possibly merging parts of each other's
patch. I've been working on splitting up the reader/writer paths so that
each type of contention is logged as well for tracking reader contentions
against that existing rwsem problem and the like, but my stuff doesn't
boot yet (working part time drags things). I/We'll keep you updated.
