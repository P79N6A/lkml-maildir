If there's a solution people are willing to implement, and one
they aren't - doesn't that say something?  Static tracepoint
patches for numerous architectures have existed and been maintained
out-of-tree for years.

The arches already have instrumentation - just not dynamic 
instrumentation.  The reason static tracepoints have been
implemented and kprobes haven't is that static tracepoints
are sufficient for what those people are doing, and dynamic
tracepoints are a pain to implement.
Let me repeat that, just in case people missed it:
"Static tracepoints work for what I need."  If other people
want to implement something fancier that works for them,
then feel free.
