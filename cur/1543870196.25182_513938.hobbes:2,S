OK, I've fixed this by hoisting all the native_* implementations into
pgtable.h.  In the !PARAVIRT case the normal macros directly use the
native_* functions, and in the PARAVIRT case they're used by the native
paravirt_ops.  This has the nice property of avoiding this specific
problem, and also generally removes code duplication.
