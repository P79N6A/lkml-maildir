There was quite the flame-fest on the lkml a while back regarding
how the semantics of "file as a directory" should operate.  There's
a number of really nasty corner cases that you need to deal with.
Go back and re-read the whole flame-fest, understand all the points
raised, and let us know when you have a workable proposal.
(Hint - "file as directory" broke a number of programs that didn't
expect that a file *could* be a directory, when run on a reiser4
filesystem...)
