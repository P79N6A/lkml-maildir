Used to work up to 3.1.20, which didn't build on 2.2.18pre3 - the 5/9
 snapshot compiles but I get this in /var/log/messages:
Sep  5 17:49:38 princess cardmgr[840]: executing: './network start eth0'
Sep  5 17:49:38 princess kernel: TxStopped 
Sep  5 17:49:41 princess kernel: TxStopped 
Sep  5 17:49:41 princess kernel: RxStopped 
Sep  5 17:49:41 princess kernel: eth0: Setting full-duplex based on MII#0 link partner capability of 41e1. 
 and while lights blink I can't get my DHCP address (tcpdump -n sees
  packets though).
 As cardmgr works with both 2.2.18pre2 and 2.4.0-test8-pre5 I
  assume it's an issue with the tulip_cb module alone.
Let me know what more I can do, thanks in advance & ciao,
