I have this:
-----------------------
[root@coyote linux-2.6]# grep I2C .config
# I2C support
CONFIG_I2C=y
CONFIG_I2C_CHARDEV=y
# I2C Algorithms
CONFIG_I2C_ALGOBIT=y

and this:
-----------------
[root@coyote linux-2.6]# grep SENSORS .config
# CONFIG_SENSORS_ADM1021 is not set
CONFIG_SENSORS_EEPROM=y
# CONFIG_SENSORS_IT87 is not set

CONFIG_SENSORS_VIA686A=y
CONFIG_SENSORS_W83781D=y
---------------------
set for a Biostar M7VIB mobo.  It all works for 2.4.
No errors were noted during the build other than the advansys 
deprecated "check_region" calls that have been noted here previously.
But:
--------------------

11 directories, 0 files
-----------------------
And ALL of that is related to the various eeproms in the system.  
Mostly on my bt979 card.
To back out and do a tree on /sys/devices gets me 171 directories and 
583 files, none of which are named 'input_fan1'.
So obviously something didn't get built, and it looks like its the 
winbond stuff.  The question is why?  Is there some method that can 
be used to interrogate the kernel and determine if the stuff is 
actually in there?

No such subdir in the devices dir...
