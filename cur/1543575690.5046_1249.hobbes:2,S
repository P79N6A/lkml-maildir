Right, well, I applied your suggestions, and I got it to oops -- dunno how,
but it oopsed.

Strange thing is that it doesn't call BUG() and the trace seems quite
identical -- this caused me to start looking at the code in
drivers/md/raid5.c and it seems this null pointer deref is coming from there
- Neil, do you have some documentation on how this code should work, as
stripe_head causes some null-pointer-derefs inside my head..
It seems a stripe_head is quite similar to a block_head, but why is
raid5_end_buffer_io calling the bh_end_io function from the stripe_head, I'd
assume it should be called from ll_rw_block.c?
