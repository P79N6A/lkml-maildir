It looks like tha 8139too, at least in 2.2.19, works fine when there
is one such card around but with NICs it detects both but fails to
set the second one correctly (complaints about incorrect IRQ, memory,
... - you name it).  Does anybody has some ideas what is going on here?
This was observed on Alpha, BTW, but this tidbit is likely not relevant
and, yes, we used pairs of other NICs before on similar machines.
Alternate rtl8139 module from that kernel cannot detect D-link DFE-538
card.  A version of this driver from 
http://www.scyld.com
 seems to be ok
(at least both cards start) once you will get it to compile. :-)
