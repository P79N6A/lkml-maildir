Actually there are a LOT of places that atm_dev_lock is held across sleeps -
I've been meaning to deal with them for awhile.  Some of them are noted by
the Stanford checker, others are outside its reach (like calls into the
function pointers in atm_dev).  I've been meaning to fix it once and for all
by turning that spinlock into a semaphore, but have not had a chance to
audit the code and make sure that it will be safe in all circumstances.
I need to trace all the interrupt paths and see what their locking needs
are.
I'm not at home tonight so I can't look at the code much right now, but
I'll try to sort out what the best fix is and forward it on to you.
