New patch at 
http://files.fredemmott.co.uk/rp3.diff
Changes:
- No memory leak :) (as far as I'm aware)
- Haven't mucked up the diff this time (last time forgot the "-N")
- Can take serial number as a module parameter
- Debug output only included rejected processess - I'll probably change this 
back
Todo:
- Make the list of allowed process inode-based
- Make the list of allowed processes alterable via userspace; probably sysfs - 
I'm reading documentation on kobject...
