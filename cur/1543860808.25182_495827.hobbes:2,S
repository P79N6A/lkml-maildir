Here is the archived version (click on "get diff" link):
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/25/2
Andrew (akpm) already picked it up:
| The patch titled
|      Update Documentation/pci.txt
| has been added to the -mm tree.  Its filename is
|      update-documentation-pcitxt.patch
Maybe it's easier for you to grab the patch directly from akpm?
thanks for checking again!
