Why should they? They may just stick with
pcspkr driver if they want.

Another point is PM callbacks. Somehow
snd-pcsp will have to register them with
pcspkr.

Oh, that's really bad, I didn't know
they do. For what reason? And how then
people disable the beeps?
Btw, could you please name a few? At
least Fedora has it as a module.
OK, I'll see about using pcspkr.c. But
it looks like the needed hooks won't be
too small (call to disable the beeps and
a call to register the PM callbacks) and
unlikely to be accepted upstream...
