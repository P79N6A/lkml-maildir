Hi,
IIRC, the way VMIN>0,VTIME=0 is supposed to work is to make characters 
available to the top level queue to be read when the low level input 
queue contains VMIN or more characters. Until that moment, there are 
no characters available to a read of any buffer size regardless of how 
many characters have been received at the low level. This is why a 
single character read blocks when at least one character has been 
received but not yet VMIN characters. Only data in the top level queue 
can be read. If the line discipline has not yet released data to the 
top level queue because of VMIN, then no data can be read, but this is 
not an error. 
Many have been tempted to change the behavior of this part of the 
system. IMHO, it is not worth tossing away application portability. 
Standards compliance can feel a bit like vertigo while instrument 
flying. Sometimes one has to just stare at the artificial horizon and 
say "I believe it" to one's self until the gut is convinced. 
Best regards,
Ed
