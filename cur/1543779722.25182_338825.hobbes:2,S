As I already mentioned for msleep_interruptible this is a really terrible 
interface.
The "jiffies_to_msecs(msecs_to_jiffies(timeout_msecs) + 1)" case (when the 
process is immediately woken up again) makes the caller suspectible to 
timeout manipulations and requires constant reauditing, that no caller 
gets it wrong, so it's better to avoid this error source completely.
Constant conversion between different time units is a really bad idea. If 
the user needs the remaining time, he is really better off to do it 
himself by checking jiffies and only does an initial conversion from 
relative to absolute (kernel) time.
This wrapper function really should be an inline function and should look 
more like this:
static inline int schedule_timeout_msecs(unsigned int timeout_msecs)
{
	return schedule_timeout(msecs_to_jiffies(timeout_msecs) + 1) != 0;
}
bye, Roman
