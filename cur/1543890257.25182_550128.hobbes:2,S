In fact, I'd like drivers to use notifiers to actually load the firmware into
memory before hibernation/suspend.  Namely, if there's PM_PRE_FREEZE, the
driver calls request_firmware() from within the notifier and saves the firmware
in memory for future use, if need be.  Later, when PM_POST_THAW comes, the
memory holding the firmware is released.
Unfortunately there are drivers that call request_firmware() directly from
.resume() which blocks until timeout expires and fails anyway.  I just wanted
this to fail immediately, without waiting.

Yes.
