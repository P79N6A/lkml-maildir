No, because Linux encourages distributions to try  out features they think
their customers need. Suse/Novell is shipping enterprise kernels which work
on large hardware, have the optimizations needed for supported hardware
vendors and for third party like RDBMS.
They even backport drivers so their kernels are more stable  and compatible
for their customers.
If you look at debian kernels, they have even more patches. Some of them are
even needed to actually make them boot on some platforms.
