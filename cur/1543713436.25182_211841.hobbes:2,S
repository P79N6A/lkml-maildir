Subject: 2.6.x kernels and ttyS45 for 6 serial ports ?

Some time ago I reported that serial ports numbering on 2.5.x/2.6.x
was rather weird when used with a 4-serial port PCI card and 2
standard onboard serial ports.
I got devices ttyS0/1/14/15/2/3 or something.
Now checking this on 2.6.5 it got more confusing, I now have with
total of 6 serial ports a device number ttyS45 !?
The way this device numbering seems to work is that many device names
are reserved in include/asm/serial.h for devices like fourport/boca/hub6.
Anything else (=all PCI cards?) gets a number still unassigned.
Note that eg. the SCSI disk equivalent of this strategy would be to
reserver eg. sda-sde for IBM disks and other brands start
numbering at sdf !
Attached patch 'fixes' this for me, been using it for past
6 months or so.

Dmesg from 2.6.5

Applied this patch on stock 2.6.5

And now I get this more logical numbering
