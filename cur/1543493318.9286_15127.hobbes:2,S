It's probably xconfig/config scripts bug.
1. It is warning only, shouldn't be important. However it's always safer
   to run "make oldconfig" in such a situation as xconfig is terribly buggy
2. If it hurts you much: you can try to use my xconfig patch. Look at:
    
ftp://rudy.mif.pg.gda.pl/pub/People/ankry/linux-patches/2.2/xconfig/
   However it is still in beta phase...
3. Typing "make config" is always the safest way to configure the kernel
   compilation.
