One more, (as reported a few weeks ago):
rmmod aic7xxx 
will fail, as this module uses some wrong locks. This will also block sleeping 
(tested w. ACPI) if the module is there.
IMHO this module is crucial to many systems.
I'm just repeating this issue, as I cannot see any patch for that. Justin has 
not replied (I will need to be CC'ed). Andrew, who's the maintainer? I wish I 
could help myself solve that, but fixing SMP-safe locks seems the hardest 
thing I could do here. Somebody has to help here.
