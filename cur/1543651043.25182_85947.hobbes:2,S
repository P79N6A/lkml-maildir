Thank goodness for this :)  I was already thinking of adding an 'Option
Usefbdev' for the xfree86 driver.

I grepped the source for currcon, and did not see any instances where
it's being updated.  So, I removed the "if (con == info->currcon)" line
and panning worked again for the current console.  However, switching to
another console screws up the viewport again.  The viewport will be
restored if I scrolled past yres_virtual.
Perhaps, I should apply your console patches?  I haven't done that yet.

I was trying to confirm if vgacon should restore its own state or not.
 
But this one is neat :)  I added VGA save/restore state routines to
fb_open() and fb_release().  I was able to boot to a VGA console, fired
up XFBDev and DirectFB and exited back again to a VGA console.  DirectFB
came back without problems, XFBDev needed a console reset.  
I guess the save/restore state routines will only be needed for graphics
card with a VGA core.  I think multiple graphics card or multi-head
systems will not be affected since the driver will only be
saving/restoring its own hardware anyway.

You have this in Kconfig in the 'console' directory.
config FONT_8x16
	bool "VGA 8x16 font" if FBCON_FONTS   
	depends on FB && SGI_NEWPORT_CONSOLE=y
I changed the '&&' operator to '||' in my case.

The patch exceeded 40K uncompressed, so here's a link:
http://i810fb.sourceforge.net/draw_ops.diff.gz
The diff is against 2.5.45 plus your fbdev.diff.
