I would much rather see this fixed in the driver itself.
For the time being, a "dummy" suspend routine could look like this:
static int foo_suspend(struct usb_interface *intf, pm_message_t msg)
{
	up(&intf->dev.sem);
	device_release_driver(&intf->dev);
	down(&intf->dev.sem);
	return 0;
}
Getting reprobed during resume would be more difficult; it would need help 
from userspace.
Maybe UEAGLE can do something a little more sensible...
