Excuse me. What NACK is remaining?

I explained that this approach pushes the parameter on the stack memory
and behaves as if the parameter was passed by function calls.

But if this approach is still unacceptable,
please discuss and adopt AppArmor's patches as soon as possible.
Both AppArmor and TOMOYO needs vfsmount parameters, but
I'm sad to see no comments on AppArmor's vfsmount patches.
