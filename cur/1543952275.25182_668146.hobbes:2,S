Not sure if I understand the question correctly but obviously a pair
(mirror) of servers running "dangerous" ramback would survive a crash
of one machine and we could practically eliminate the probability of
both (all) machines crashing simultaneously. However, there are
cheaper ways to achieve similar performance and even better
reliability - including those battery-backed (RAI)Disk controllers.
