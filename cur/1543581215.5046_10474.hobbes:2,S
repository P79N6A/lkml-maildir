I can handle requests larger than a page (64K) but I am not using 
the buffer cache in Linux.  We really need an NT/NetWare like model 
to support the non-Unix FS's properly.
i.e.   
a disk request should be 
<disk> <lba> <length> <buffer> and get rid of this fixed block 
stuff with buffer heads. :-)
I understand that the way the elevator is implemented in Linux makes
this very hard at this point to support, since it's very troublesome 
to handling requests that overlap sector boundries.
