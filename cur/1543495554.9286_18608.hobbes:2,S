What about people who really, really don't want modules enabled?  Boot-time
autodetection (module load time for people who use modules) with __initfuncs
gives you pretty much all the advantages, and lets people choose between
modules and builtin.

PCMCIA is the only reason I use modules on any of the dozens of Linux systems 
I look after.  I would really like an _option_ to not use modules and instead
use __initfuncs (if a PCMCIA machine is only ever used in a fixed config).  If
you move boot-time config to run-time then you need to move things out of
__initfuncs in the non-modular case.. which isn't good :-(
David (who personally would prefer to see PCMCIA in the standard kernel, and 
       loose the array of different licenses covering it, but now doesn't
       know if it will ever happen since PCMCIA has moved to MPL).
