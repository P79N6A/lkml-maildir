The printer seems to have a problem switching to IEEE1284_DEVICEID mode
shortly after initialization.
It happens in userspace, too, if the program accessing /dev/parport0 has
to autoload the module.
In userspace, my workaround (ugly, but works) is replacing
	mode = IEEE1284_MODE_NIBBLE | IEEE1284_DEVICEID;
	ioctl(fd, PPNEGOT, &mode);
with
	result = 1;
	mode = IEEE1284_MODE_NIBBLE | IEEE1284_DEVICEID;
	for(i=0; i<15 && result!=0; i++)
		result=ioctl(fd, PPNEGOT, &mode);
I guess the kernel autoprobing fails because of the exact same thing.
errno = 5 for the first couple of ioctl()s.
