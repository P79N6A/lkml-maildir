I recently underwent the effort to setup an older parallel Colour QuickCam on 
Linux using the Video4Linux interface. However, when I went to boot, I got 
an "INVALID CHECKSUM 0005" error:
3c59x: Donald Becker and others. www.scyld.com/network/vortex.html
0000:00:09.0: 3Com PCI 3c900 Cyclone 10Mbps TPO at 0xd400. Vers LK1.1.19
 ***INVALID CHECKSUM 0005*** <6>Linux video capture interface: v1.00
Colour QuickCam for Video4Linux v0.05
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 7.00alpha2
I've never encountered an error like this before; I asked around and people 
suggested testing my RAM (Which I did, everything was fine), and recompiling 
my kernel. I recompiled my kernel image, and used dd to copy to avoid errors 
in the copying of the kernel.
I'd apreaciate you CC any replies to my home e-
