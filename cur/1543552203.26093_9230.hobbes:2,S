Hmm... Possibly VM related.
Are you using 2.4.0-test9? There are some not so nice things that
are fixed in later "test10-preX" (from "testing" subdirectory,
pre3 might be the best choice)
Even if you are using test10 you could run vmstat 1 and include
a typical part. An ALT-SysRq-M (need magic sysrq compiled and enabled)
could be useful too.
