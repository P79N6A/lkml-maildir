Hi,
i have a bought an EPOX board (4G4A+) with Intel i845G chipset. While i was 
trying a 2.4.18 kernel, the machine stops after "Ok, booting the kernel ...". I 
have to use the lilo command mem=<memory without shared graphic ram>M in 
megabytes. All kernels newer than 2.4.3 cause this error. Since version 2.4.19, 
this solution is unusable. I think, this is a kernel problem, because i know 
from other people having the same problem, but other boards with i845G. I need 
the 2.4.19 to use my HPT372. Please help and finf the error.
I think the problem is a failure in the routine getting the size of memory from 
BIOS. Linux thinks, i have 640k!!! RAM. Only the mem-parameter can solve it.
Thx
janek
