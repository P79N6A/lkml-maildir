I did work on a 'light weight percpu counter', aka percpu_lcounter, for
all metrics that dont need 64 bits wide, but a plain 'long'
(network, nr_files, nr_dentry, nr_inodes, ...)
struct percpu_lcounter {
        atomic_long_t count;
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
#ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU
        struct list_head list;  /* All percpu_counters are on a list */
#endif
        long *counters;
#endif
};
(No more spinlock)
Then I tried to have atomic_t  (or atomic_long_t) for 'counters', but got a
10% slow down of __percpu_lcounter_add(), even if never hitting the 'slow path'
atomic_long_add_return() is really expensiven, even on a non contended cache
line.
struct percpu_lcounter {
        atomic_long_t count;
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
#ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU
        struct list_head list;  /* All percpu_counters are on a list */
#endif
        atomic_long_t *counters;
#endif
};
So I believe the percpu_clounter_sum() that tries to reset to 0 all cpu local
 counts would be really too expensive, if it slows down _add() so much.
long percpu_lcounter_sum(struct percpu_lcounter *fblc)
{
        long acc = 0;
        int cpu;
        for_each_online_cpu(cpu)
                acc += atomic_long_xchg(per_cpu_ptr(fblc->counters, cpu), 0);
        return atomic_long_add_return(acc, &fblc->count);
}
void __percpu_lcounter_add(struct percpu_lcounter *flbc, long amount, s32 batch)
{
        long count;
        atomic_long_t *pcount;
        pcount = per_cpu_ptr(flbc->counters, get_cpu());
        count = atomic_long_add_return(amount, pcount); /* way too expensive !!! */
        if (unlikely(count >= batch || count <= -batch)) {
                atomic_long_add(count, &flbc->count);
                atomic_long_sub(count, pcount);
        }
        put_cpu();
}
Just forget about it and let percpu_lcounter_sum() only read the values, and
let percpu_lcounter_add() not using atomic ops in fast path.
void __percpu_lcounter_add(struct percpu_lcounter *flbc, long amount, s32 batch)
{
        long count;
        long *pcount;
        pcount = per_cpu_ptr(flbc->counters, get_cpu());
        count = *pcount + amount;
        if (unlikely(count >= batch || count <= -batch)) {
                atomic_long_add(count, &flbc->count);
                count = 0;
        }
        *pcount = count;
        put_cpu();
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(__percpu_lcounter_add);
Also, with upcoming NR_CPUS=4096, it may be time to design a hierarchical percpu_counter,
to avoid hitting one shared "fbc->count" all the time a local counter overflows.
