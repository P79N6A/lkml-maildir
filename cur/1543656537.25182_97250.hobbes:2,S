Quite frankly, I wouldn't expect a lot of dissent.
I suspect a group approach has very little inherent disagreement, and to
me the main result of having an "approval process" is to really just slow
things down and make people think about the submitting.  The actual
approval itself is secondary (it _looks_ like a primary objective, but in
real life it's just the _existence_ of rules that make more of a
difference).

I heartily disagree with the approval process for development, just
because it gets so much in the way and just annoys people. But for
stabilization, that's exactly what you want. So I think gcc is using the
approval process much too much, but apparently it works for them.
And I think it could work for the kernel too, especially the stable
releases and for the process of getting there. I just don't really know
how to set it up well.
