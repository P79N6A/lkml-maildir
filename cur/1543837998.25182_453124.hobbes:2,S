I noticed you have the mode set to Master, is this intentional?
I've found my Prism54 (which is an older model, but the same firmware) 
requires me to ifconfig up before I can set iwconfig parameters correctly.
The only changes I can see to the prism driver in 2.6.16 are:

Both very minor changes. What was the last kernel that worked? Have you tried  
with acpi=off? Is this a PCI or PCMCIA card?
