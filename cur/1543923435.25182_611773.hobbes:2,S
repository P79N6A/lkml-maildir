That's no different than what can happen today -- if a task actually
is in an 8 node cpuset, sets up its mempolicies accordingly, and then
gets shoe horned into a 4 node cpuset.
It's not good or bad; it's just interactions between two mechanisms.
If your app doesn't run well in a small cpuset, don't run it there
(or do run it there, poorly ;).
