Is this an original 2.2.9 kernel or a vendor supplied one. Please try a
vanilla kernel if it is a vendor supplied kernel and if it is then fine
please let me know.
If you are using an unpatched kernel can you tell me what sort of magic
the debugger uses - does it always fail or does it fail only if you have
performed some operations first.

No. Setuid root processes actually don't dump core (unless you are root anyway)
Do other programs choke in the same way on your kernel ?
