Forget it, my error.
What is it that you don't need when mmap()ing
a real file? You don't need to lseek()back
to the beginning after reading enough of it to
look at the magic string (which happened in between
the open() and the call to gethash().
Thanks for your time in responding to or
filtering out this non-kernel error.
