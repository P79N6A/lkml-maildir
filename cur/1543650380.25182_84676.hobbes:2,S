Thought I'd point out that this is old news. Very old in fact.
This was set when the DVD-R standard was put in place ...
Or actually, shortly thereafter.
At first there was only one standard, DVD-R. Now there are two at
different wavelengths, DVD For General (cannot copy css encrypted
things) and DVD-R For Authoring which can but those discs cost a lot 
more. DVD-R was renamed DVD-R For Authoring.
