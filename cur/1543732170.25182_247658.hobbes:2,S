Martin,
Looks like having a config item simultaneously
depend on something and select it is a bad idea;-)
Let me know if this patch fixes the symptoms you see.
With your config and this patch I'm able to de-select
X86_HT and ACPI, which I think is what you were looking for, yes?
Andrew, thanks for spotting this earlier -- sorry I didn't
get back sooner.
thanks,
-Len
