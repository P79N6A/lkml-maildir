Bulls^WNope, it was a bad example (we don't want to break the compilation, just 
not want to emit a warn or an err).
I can't emit an error with the thing like that, only a warning, but we are not 
using -Werror to get err from a warn. Thing such this would emit empty-statement 
warn if define KILLER as 1:
#if KILLER == 1
#define MACRO
#else
#define MACRO do { } while (0)
#endif
{
  	if (some_condition)
  		MACRO;
	else
		do_something();
}
