Once again I agree. What I'm saying is altering the magic incantation even 
with just one knob will lead to unexpected results so a complete overhaul is 
probably the correct way to tackle the unnecessary complexity. I see at least 
4 of them happening on list already by people with much more coding skill 
than I'll ever have and am happy that interactivity is one of the things high 
on people's minds for development.
