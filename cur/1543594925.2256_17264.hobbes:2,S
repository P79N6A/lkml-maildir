And how do you ensure that no interrupt is lost ?
In fact you now are likely to have a race condition reading device status or 
the like.

Which IMHO makes the concept pretty much useless.
Interrupt sharing is pretty much the norm today. And there is no evidence for

Which devices were you thinking of, that need a hardware IRQ and no kernel 
driver ?
