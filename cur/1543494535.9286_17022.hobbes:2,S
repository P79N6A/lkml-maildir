Hi,
I have a loadable module I wrote that implements
synchronous message passing, see:
 
http://toronto.qenesis.com/Sam/srr.html
I'm having a problem in that a process that has called
sleep_on_interruptible is waking up when I have *not* called
wake_up_interruptible() on it's wait queue, and it's signal
mask does *not* indicate a pending unmasked signal (or
masked one, for that matter).
Does anybody have any suggestions as to why this might happen?
I'm using whatever kernel version shipped with redhat 5.1, a
?.?.137 I think (sorry, I have a terrible memory for numbers).
Sam
