the advantage is that the string, which means plenty to the developer, but possibly
much less to a Sys Admin, can be replaced with a more descriptive message,
in the local language, by editing the formatting template in user-space.  Since the
printk messages were mapped directly over to the problem macros, then the issue here
I think is how useful (or not) the info. is more so than what interface is used.

indeed.  See previous comment.
