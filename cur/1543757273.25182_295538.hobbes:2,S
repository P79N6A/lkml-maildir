Can you find it written down somewhere? It would be certainly easier
for me if every BIOS did re-post, but it is not the case on any new
BIOS....

I think we are missing few lines in docs somewhere saying "video must
be re-POSTed during S3 wakeup". And then we miss someone going around
vendors with baseball bat, telling them to fix their BIOSes.
