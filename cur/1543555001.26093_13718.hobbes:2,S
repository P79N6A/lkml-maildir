When modules were first introduced, all symbols were automatically
exported.  For kernel 2.0 compatibility, a module without
EXPORT_NO_SYMBOLS actually exports everything.  There are flags on
insmod to override this default.  modutils 2.5 will remove this
backwards compatibility, no module will export symbols unless they are
explicitly exported.  If you are feeling brave, add
  insmod_opt=-x
to your modules.conf and see what breaks in 2.4.
