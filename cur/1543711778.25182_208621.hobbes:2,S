If a MODE_SENSE(6) command is sent to an IDE cd using the CDROM_SEND_PACKET
ioctl, then the kernel freezes solidly. To reproduce this, one can take the
SCSI cmd [1a 08 31 00 10 00] and a 16 byte data buffer.
After some bug hunting, I found out that the following is what happens:
- ide-cd recognizes that MODE_SENSE(6) isn't supported and tries
to abort the request from ide_cdrom_prep_pc by returning BLKPREP_KILL.
- in elv_next_request(), the kill request is handled by
the following code:
	while (end_that_request_first(rq, 0, rq->nr_sectors))
		;
	end_that_request_last(rq);
The while loop never exits. The end_that_request_first() doesn't do anything
since rq->nr_sectors is 0; it just returns "not-done" after handling those 0
bytes (rq->bio->bi_size is 16).
I'm not quite sure how to fix this properly. For one thing, the data buffer
associated with the MODE_SENSE command is not sector sized in the first
place...
This is with a recent 2.6.5-rc1 kernel built from the BK tree.
