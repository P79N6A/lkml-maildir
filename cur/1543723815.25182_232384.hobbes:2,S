Tried, but didn't work (not relevant due to new information after I tried,

I just tried a 2.4.24 kernel I compiled myself -- It doesn't work.
I tried booting the 2.4.24-xfs knoppix kernel on my actual system
instead of the knoppix CD (required a bit of fiddling to get it
booting) -- Also does not work.
So, it seems to be some configuration issue on my end, though I'm
not sure what at this point (first thing i tried way back was copying
knoppix's /etc/pcmcia).  Ah well, I'll figure it out eventually :)
Thanks for your time :)
