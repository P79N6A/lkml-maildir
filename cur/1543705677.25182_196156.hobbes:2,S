I would call pci_find_class() and continue until a NULL is returned
or my vendor and device are returned in the structure. This is
before I do anything else. That way, you know you have found your
device. This is for up to at least version 2.4.24. There have been
changes made in 2.6.eh, but I doubt that they got rid of the
essential functions necessary to locate your device(s).
Cheers,
