Use read() then. The kernel assumes a more sequential like access pattern
with read() and does more read-ahead, while it assumes a more random like
access pattern with mmap(). This is reasonable, as the primary use of mmap()
is the loading of binaries and libraries.
At least, that was the situation when I checked last.
The difference should not be so large with 2.2 kernels. With 2.0, it was
quite huge.
