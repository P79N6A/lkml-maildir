Bad analogy.  Try this.  Jim-Bob down at your local Post Office starts rejecting
all your mail that has the 4 digit zip code extension (Not in wide use, but a
"proposed standard") because he's old school and doesn't know what it is -- maybe
its secret spy communications!!!
(Although this would have the side benefit of really reducing the amount of junk
mail received . . . . . . )
And no, I'm not a lawyer.
