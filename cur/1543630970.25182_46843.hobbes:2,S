	Hmm.. my last kernel was a 2.2.17 and I remember of seeing
'*udma2' in the output of `hdparm -i`.. but I don't have the kernel config
file. :-( Does this mean I had UDMA??

	I thought the current dma mode was checked with an asterisk too..
	`hdparm -i /dev/hdb` output shows:
	[...]
	DMA modes: sdma0 sdma1 sdma2 mdma0 mdma1 *mdma2
	AdvancedPM=no
	I'm confused.. Should I change my cables? Is there any risk to use
my drive?
