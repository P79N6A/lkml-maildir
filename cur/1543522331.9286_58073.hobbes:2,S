Subject: pcmcia in 2.3.39

Every pcmcia card (one is cardbus) that I insert under 2.3.39 is identified
as an anonymous memory card.  I tried a 3com 575, 3com 589, generic modem,
and a xircom cem33 card.
Controller is a ricoh if that helps.  I had to add 2 lines to cs.o before I
could get pcmcia support to load.
I would have tried 2.3.40pre4 but I didn't have it on my laptop and it's too
late for me right now.
