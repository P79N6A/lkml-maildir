     [SCSI] stex: minor cleanups
     - fix endian bug found in s/g code (used a fixed-endian value
       as a loop-terminating variable)
     From a list of changes suggested by Christoph:
     - don't include linux/config.h
     - whitespace fix
     - let compiler choose whether or not to inline
     - eliminate unnecessary NULL test on hba->dma_mem
     - handle pci_map_sg() error
-
