Thx for the reply...
The definition for atomic_inc() used to be there in asm/atomic.h on redhat
versions 7.2..
But on redhat ver 9.0 asm/atomic.h does not have the definition for
atomic_inc().
Is it moved to anyother file on redhat 9.0??
Pls reply...

Seems you were using a kernel definition of a function (this
normally happens only because it was out there by mistake,
or because you had __KERNEL__ #defined).
It will be in include/asm/atomic.h; however, it is not wise to
use directly the kernel stuff unless you are coding kernel stuff.
You can always strip them, of course :)
