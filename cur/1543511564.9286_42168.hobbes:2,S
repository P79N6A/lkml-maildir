	I have an aha1542, and it appears the driver is still buggy.
	I don't think the reset code in the driver has ever worked correctly.
	I have a couple of cd's with bad scratches; when any of my scsi drives
	attempts to read over a scratch, the 1542 goes into a reset loop.
	Before the following patch, it would reset a couple of times and then
	die with "Panic: freeing free memory" or something close...
	(this patch against 2.2.12, but probably works in others too)

You will notice that this patch is part of aha1542.c as I distributed
it a year or so ago. 
	With this patch, the kernel no longer panics, and an I/O error is returned
	to the application.  Unfortunately, after this, the device no longer
	responds, and any access to the device causes the process to block but
	still remain killable.  I fear I've fixed a symptom, and not the real bug.
	(I.e., it still hurts, but the patient no longer dies.)
Yes. I think I fixed a few more symptoms, but am still unhappy about
the driver, that is why it is sitting in directories like
  
ftp://ftp.XX.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/aeb
or so.
Can you report on that driver ?
