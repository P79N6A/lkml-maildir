On powermacs or powerbooks, the USB controller is shut down by the
firmware when we call the "quiesce" OF call from prom_init.c, which
happens before the kernel relocates itself to 0 and takes over memory.
Unless we fucked up something in there, I wouldn't expect that to be the
cause.

Did we setup the OHCI controller when the crash happen ? Maybe we broke
something subtle in the USB stack ?
