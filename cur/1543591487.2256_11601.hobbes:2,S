Ahhh, I see.  Remember that the "cached" figure you are
seeing also includes swap-cached data from the gccs, which
results from kswapd scanning the processes, clearing the
PTE and, a bit later, the process grabbing the page again.
I suspect that if the gccs _just_ fit in memory, you can
get some extra performance by mercilessly eating from the
cache and keeping the ggcs in memory. However, I also have
the sneaking suspicion that this is not the best tactic for
all workloads ;)
