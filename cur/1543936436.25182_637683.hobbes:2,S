This is going to put trouble in other places unless, at least, it can be 
turned off.  The UART serial interface is heavily emulated as a console 
interface without an actual serial port behind it, both in hardware and 
software.  Rates will typically vastly exceed real serial port rates, 
especially emulating 16450 or 16550 (which is typical) which are limited 
to 115200 bps.
