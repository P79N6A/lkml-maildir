Ahh, thanks for letting me know this.
But this leads to the question why CD-ROM removable media revalidation
works. I mean let's see an SCSI CD-ROM, an ATAPI CD-ROM (in SCSI mode)
and ATAPI Zip (in SCSI mode) as *the same*.
They all have a host device (the mechanics itself), they all talk
through the same interface (straight SCSI or SCSI emulation). But CD-ROM
removable media revalidation works. E.g. I plug a CD in and it does the
trick, the Zip should be alike in my opinion. How does a Zip as
removable media differ from a CD for example.
By the way it would be pretty nice to improve devfs in this case. I also
heard a while back that it will be re-written anyways. Would be cool to
have a native support for that (Kernel related solution).
