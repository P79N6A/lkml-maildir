Subject: How to get kernel data using /proc system?
Hello, everyone, could anybody help me out of this? Any help would be
highly appreciated. Thanks!
I want to read out some kernel data. But I searched the web a lot and
all the methods I found in using /proc filesystem seem to be out of
date. Does anybody know how to do this in Linux 2.4 or 2.2? 
Also, are other ways to get access to kernel data than using
/proc?
Thanks a lot!
