Subject: [PATCH] x86-64: suppress mce boot log on Fam 10 and 11
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/10/138

At least on my Barcelona, I see MCE log entries after cold boot caused
by BIOS not properly clearing the respective registers. Therefore, this
patch extends the workaround to families 0x10 and 0x11 (the latter just
for completeness, I have nothing to verify this against).
At the same time, provide a way to make these entries visible via the
'mce=bootlog' command line option even on these machines.
