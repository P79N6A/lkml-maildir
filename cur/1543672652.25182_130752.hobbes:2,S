Hi,
I've undone aic7xxx changes which were locking up some machines on
initialization.
The new driver is now named drivers/scsi/aic79xx and is under
CONFIG_AIC79XX.
Justin, unfortunately I can't even THINK about updating aic7xxx to your
new driver at the current release stage. I will do so in the 2.4.22.
The update also contains a PCI posting flush fix from Arjan.
People, please test the driver.
