No, but here it is, on both sda and sda1:
[root@coyote root]# dosfsck /dev/sda
dosfsck 2.8, 28 Feb 2001, FAT32, LFN
Logical sector size is zero.
[root@coyote root]# dosfsck /dev/sda1
dosfsck 2.8, 28 Feb 2001, FAT32, LFN
/dev/sda1: 2 files, 2/3997 clusters
That first one doesn't look kosher to me!
Q: Is FAT32 the same as VFAT?
