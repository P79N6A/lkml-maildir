Less \{\(\\n\t\+\)\} [0] stuff make readings regex much easier. My
confusion shows that i didn't used \{ much, because have another ways
so far. And even after my quick testing i didn't realize that there
was unrelated to main task whitespace cleanup.

Clear definition of the task will help to design a solution. I can do
the job, but figuring out all possible corner cases from current
solutions, mixed in Makefiles or everywhere else is not option.

What do you think about this one? I want to propose to remove
scripts/unifdef.c but to make clear policy about how to mark __KERNEL__
sections in header files. We know how obfuscated C can be, and this also
applies to preprocessing. There's known CodingStyle about some points.
The thing is to specify rules, that will be easy for `sed` to do cleaup
job.
./linux/soundcard.h:#if (!defined(__KERNEL__) && !defined(KERNEL) && !defined(INKERNEL)
                      && !defined(_KERNEL)) || defined(USE_SEQ_MACROS)
./linux/stat.h:#if defined(__KERNEL__) || !defined(__GLIBC__) || (__GLIBC__ < 2)
Split __KERNEL__ check, make only positive, i.e.
#if defined(__KERNEL__)
#ifdef __KERNEL__
./linux/stat.h:#ifdef __KERNEL__
No `#else` and ending part to contain comment:
./linux/smb_fs_sb.h:#endif /* __KERNEL__ */
Simple enough:
sed '/^#if[^_]*__KERNEL__/,/^#end[^_]*__KERNEL__/d'
