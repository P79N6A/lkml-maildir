Some of the patches were wordwrapped, which I fixed.
The way we would merge a feature like this is
- get maintainers to review-and-ack the change
- merge the core patch into Greg's PCI tree and later into
  mainline.
- Once the base infrastructure is in mainline, feed the per-driver
  changes into the tree via the appropriate maintainers.
This takes, umm, months and consumes quite a bit of my time.  I'm becoming
inclined just to slam stuff like this straight in as you've proposed, but
for now, let's play the game - I split the patches up appropriately.  I
don't think there's any particular urgency behind this, is there?
