Pardon?  For that kernel would have to <drumrolls> interpret the bytestream
as UTF-8.  We do not.  So your malformed UTF-8 for .. won't be treated as
.. by the kernel.
BTW, speaking of Plan 9, they do *NOT* reject malformed UTF-8 in pathnames.
Filtering they do is against ASCII controls - i.e. \1--\37 and \177.
All differences between our generic checks and Plan 9 generic checks (aside
of whatever checks particular fs might do) is:
	1) they allow longer pathnames (64K vs our 4K, from my reading of
9/port/chan.c)
	2) they do not allow pathnames containing any octet in range 1--31
	3) they do not allow pathnames containing DEL (octet 127)
The rest is identical:
	* Pathname is split into components by instances of octet 47 (/).
	* Component is special if it's {octet 46} or {octet 46, octet 46}
(. and .. resp.).
	* Name is terminated by octet 0 (NUL).
	* Name components are fed to filesystem drivers without any conversions
- they go as arrays of char, with no concern for encoding.
So could we please put that strawman to rest?
