That kernel didn't have the TSO thing.  Pretty much all of these reports
have been against e1000_alloc_rx_buffers() since the TSO changes went in.
I may have been asleep at the time.  Could someone pleeeeze explain to me
why the introduction of TSO has thrown this additional pressure onto the
atomic memory allocations?
Did you try disabling TSO, btw?
