Yes, it certainly does. You using it rather than vunmap() makes me notice
other inconsistencies (but harmless in nature): The ioremap_change_attr()
failure case should use the same function, and iounmap() could be
simplified using it, too.

Never supposed to be doesn't mean they really aren't. I think as long as
one permits it, the other should undo its effects. Further more, it would
seem to me that you could easily ioremap() a hot-pluggable (but
unpopulated) memory range, and get into inconsistencies once that
range gets actually populated. Or am I not seeing a safeguard
preventing this?

Yes, that's exactly what I would have thought it should look like.

Great, thanks!
