If you are going to S4 sleep, you should better make sure no other
processors are changing stuff under your hands. Easiest way to do that
is by putting them offline (I see no other good solutions). For S3
having to save state of one CPU is bad enough, having to save state of
8 would be bad, so putting them offline would be handy, too.
