Ehh..
Why don't you use the "isapnp" or "acpi" interfaces?
Yeah yeah, you don't actually have isapnp on your system. But like it or 
not, when we talk ISA enumeration, there is an existing standard for doing 
it. And since the drivers involved don't actually do BIOS calls or 
anything like that, they don't need to know that your "acpi" or "isapnp" 
enumeration comes from ppc64 firmware..
