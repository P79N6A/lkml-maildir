See 
http://kernel.org/patchtypes/mm.html
:
"""
The -mm patches to the Linux kernel
The -mm patches are a set of patches, released by Andrew Morton, against the official kernel series. They are frequently more experimental in nature than the official series. These patches are available in Andrew's kernel directory:
    /pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/
