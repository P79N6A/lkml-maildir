'buf' is not page-aligned, so 'buf' + 'bytes' can touch the next page,
which may not be mapped.  In fact, if 'buf' points to the *last* valid
mapped page (before the stack), and the stack ulimit is unlimited, the
VM_GROWSDOWN logic considers this access a request to grow the stack
down to this very page ...
