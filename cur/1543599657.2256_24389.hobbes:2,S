You obviously do not understand the issue at all.
It doesn't _matter_ that the int covers the whole space of "unsigned
char".
What if the "int" happens to be negative?
Right. You get _totally_ different results for a unsigned and a signed
compare. For the signed compare, you do obviously get the "logical"
result, that the negative int is smaller than the unsigned char. But if
you're not _aware_ of the signedness, you may not think about the issues.
Basically, when you compare a "long" to a "xxx", and the xxxx is unsigned,
WHAT ARE THE RESULTS?
And the answer is that you simply DO NOT KNOW! If the xxxx is "unsigned
int", the sign of the compare actually depends on whether "int" is smaller
than "long" on the particular architecture you're compiling for. So the
sign of the compare actually ends up being different on an alpha than on a
x86.
Stating the type you compare in explicitly means that you do not get
surprised.
And not getting surprisied is a good thing.
