Yes, highmem was on, the stystem got 4G of memory.  I turned off
highmem and got no messages apart from one:
Aug 21 07:29:19 ps1 kernel: (scsi0:A:0:0): Locking max tag count at 64
which I was getting before.
Disk access is faster then before but still slower then the IDE
drive.  Any ideas?
Thanks for the help.
