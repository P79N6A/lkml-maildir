OK.  One more time.
The autoconfigurator is *not* mean to be run at boot time, or as root.
It is intended to be run by ordinary users, after system boot time.
This is so they can configure and experimentally build kernels without
incurring the "oops..." risks of going root.
Therefore, the above 'solution' is not acceptable.
