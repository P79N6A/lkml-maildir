It's MSSpeak to call something that's several years old "revolutionary
new".
<simplification warning on>
You'll get severely burned if you try to compare WolfPack with Beowulf,
they have totally different purposes, and definitely don't do the same.
The MS WolfPack/Novell WolfMountain thing is not something we really
support well at the moment, it's the ability of one machine to take over a
process/ressource from another and continue working as if nothing
happened.
In Linux terms, this is what the checkpointing API and Linux-HA is about.
Beowulf is a machine architechture for sharing computing power, or disc
bandwidth or whatever to make something that looks like a much faster
machine and is something Linux supports very well indeed.
<simplification warning off>
You shouldn't confuse the two things, since that would make for extremely
good targets for factual attacks by MS, instead of just FUD.
