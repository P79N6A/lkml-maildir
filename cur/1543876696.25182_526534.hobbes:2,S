Yeah, it's working but failing resets are considered highly dangerous
(in that the controller status is unknown and may cause something
dangerous like screaming interrupts) and port is muted after that.  The
plan is to handle this with polling hotplug such that libata tries to
revive the port if PHY status change is detected by polling.  Patches
are available but they need other things to resolved to get integrated.
 I think it'll happen before the summer.
Anyways, you can tell libata to retry the port by manually telling it to
rescan the port (echo - - - > /sys/class/scsi_host/hostX/scan).

Yeap, seems like a broken drive to me.
Thanks.
