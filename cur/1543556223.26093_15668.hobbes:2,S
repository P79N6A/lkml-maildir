| In fact it does not 'replace' the other mixer device, but it adds
| another one. The problem on your system is, that you load the new
| module before your sound card module.

| card module, major 14/minor 0 is assigned to tvmixer and your sound
| card mixer gets major 14/minor 16. This is a problem for some mixer

OK, that makes it somewhat clearer to me. However, I don't use modules
and have everything compiled in, so I can't control the order in which
the mixer devices get loaded. Perhaps the initialization order in the
kernel should be changed?
Excuse my ignorance, but what exactly is the purpose of the tvmixer?
I'm currently controlling the TV audio volume with the ac97 mixer,
using an external cable between the TV card and sound card.
