In other words,
/* structs to maintain pointers to the lower VFS objects */
struct fsstack_sb_info {
	union {
		struct super_block *sb;
		struct super_block **sbs;
	};                                                                      
};                                                                         
should become:
union fsstack_sb_info {
	struct super_block *sb;
	struct super_block **sbs;
};
