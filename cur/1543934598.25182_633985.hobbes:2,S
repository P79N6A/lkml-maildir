Hi Steven,
Great work!

Yes, I'd love to add this information source to LTTng. It simply boils
down to adding a "notrace" flag to LTTng tracing functions. Since I
don't use relay code _at all_ in the tracing path, there is no problem
with this (I only disable preemption and do "local" atomic operations on
per-cpu variables). Then I would have to do the glue code that registers
the LTTng handler to your mcount mechanism.
One interesting aspect of LTTng is that is would be very lightweight.
You seem to use interrupt disabling with your simple tracer and do a
_lot_ of cacheline bouncing (trace_idx[NR_CPUS] is a very good exemple).
LTTng would write the information to a per-cpu memory buffer in binary
format. I see that it would be especially useful in flight recorder
mode, where we overwrite the buffers without writing them to disk : when
a problematic condition is reached, (a kernel oops would be a good one),
then we just stop tracing and dump the last buffers to disk. In this
case, we would have the last function calls that led to an OOPS.
