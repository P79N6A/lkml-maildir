In fact it does not 'replace' the other mixer device, but it adds
another one. The problem on your system is, that you load the new
module before your sound card module.
This means with only your sound card module, the mixer for your sound
card is major 14/minor 0. With tvmixer module loaded before your sound
card module, major 14/minor 0 is assigned to tvmixer and your sound
card mixer gets major 14/minor 16. This is a problem for some mixer
applications, because they always control the first mixer device.
So you should just make sure, your sound card module is loaded
_before_ the tvmixer module.
