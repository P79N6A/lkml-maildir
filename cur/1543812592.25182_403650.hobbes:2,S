It just seems to me that things like Beagle are all well and good, but
what would be really useful to /me/ :-) is a hack for locate. It's
probably been done and I'm rambling for nothing - someone put me out
of my misery with a link?
Or I can look at fixing it for myself otherwise. This is something
Microsoft almost "get right" with their fast indexing service.
