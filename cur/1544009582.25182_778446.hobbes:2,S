Hi Linus,
Please pull the 'drm-fixes' branch from
ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/airlied/drm-2.6.git drm-fixes
Radeon had an oops due to the vblank rework reported on-list,
and Intel have two fixes one to use MSI on the 965GM and one to avoid
corrupt rendering.
Dave.

    drm/i915: Disable the GM965 MSI errata workaround.
    
    Since applying the fix suggested by the errata (disabling MSI), we've had
    issues with interrupts being stuck on despite IIR being 0 on GM965 hardware.
    Most reporters of the issue have confirmed that turning MSI back on fixes
    things, and given the difficulties experienced in getting reliable MSI working
    on Linux, it's believable that the errata was about software issues and not
    actual hardware issues.

    drm/i915: Don't return error in evict_everything when we get to the end.
    
    Returning -ENOMEM errored all the way out of execbuf, so the rendering never
    occurred.

    drm/radeon: don't actually enable the IRQ regs until irq is enabled
    
    vblank can try and enable the IRQ registers before we've set the interrupt
    handler up.
