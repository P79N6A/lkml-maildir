Actually, it was fsck's filesystem type detection code, and it's since
been completely rewritten.

It's certainly possible for mistakes to be made, but it is really
quite reliable at this point --- escpecially since various
filesystem's mkfs programs and various lvm partition initialization
progams are pretty good about erasing other filesystems' signatures as
part of the mkfs/partition init process.  
Everything is really a "guess" at some level; there is no guarantee
that /etc/fstab is 100% accurate, or that the partition table's type
fields are accurate.  I will say that the ID code in the blkid library
is pretty paranoid about sanity checks, although of course it could be
better.

Blkid deliberately doesn't revalidate devices without any command-line
arguments, because certain devices might timeout or block for a
long-time.  If you use "blkid /dev/sdb4", or use the library
interfaces, it will revalidate any entries found in the cache file
before returning them.
