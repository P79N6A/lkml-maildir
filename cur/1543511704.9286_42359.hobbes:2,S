I think persistance in this case is meant to mean persistant device
permissions, not persistant device locations. Indeed, the very problem is
that devices are _not_ persistant.
And I agree with you Michael about the devices (and therefore device nodes)
not being persistant being a hinderance with the file-oriented UNIX system.
But there are several other UNIX philosophies (for instance, easy
scriptability) that make it still neccessary.
But I do definately believe that there is a way to have file-level access to
a dynamic system much better than the current /dev/* structure with
major/minor numbers. It just takes a little bit of arguing, and a lot of
code (or was that the other way around? ;-))
