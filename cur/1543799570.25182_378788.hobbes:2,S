I copied it from driver/base/node.c which implements node exportation by sysfs. I will change it. 
I couldn't find a better place than driver/base.

It's a stupid problem. I will fix it.

It's not needed and will be deleted.

As you know, current i386/x86_64 arch also export cache info under /sys/device/system/cpu/cpuX/cache. Is it clearer to export topology under a new directory than under cpu directly?

If no ifdef here, gcc reported a compiling warning when I compiled it on IA64 with CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n.

Thank you for the good comments. I will work out a new patch.
