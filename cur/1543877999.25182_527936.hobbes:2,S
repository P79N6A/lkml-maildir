But kmap_atomic_pte is a special case of kmap_atomic for ptes. 
Interrupt routines can still use plain kmap_atomic for bouncebuffers and
so on.
A more general patch would be to make kmap/unmap_atomic pv_ops, and then
they can all be rolled together.  I.e: check the type to see if special
pte handling needs to happen, etc.
