It is a different problem I think, yours will fix the starvation of
writers (of readers, writers is much much easier to trigger though)
where someone will repeatedly get cheaten by the request allocator.
The other problem is still not clear to anyone. I doubt this patch would
make any difference (apart from a psychological one) in this case,
since you have a single writer and maybe a reader or two. The single
writer cannot starve anyone else.
