The 12 seconds coming and 8 seconds going, versus instant, sounds an *awful*
lot like the virtual memory manager making better choices in -mm kernels, so
the pages of pixmap are staying in memory rather than paging out.
Other guess is that o21-sched.patch is DTRT, while the stock scheduler DTWT
for his particular config.
Gene:  Can you tell what exactly your system is doing for the 12/8 seconds?  Is it
CPU bound, or beating on the disk while paging in/out, or just sitting idle?  Leaving
a 'vmstat 1' running while you change backdrops should tell us something.
