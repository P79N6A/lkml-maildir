Thankfully it's going away real soon.  It failed to depend on OSS,
didn't have decent help text, and doesn't live under Sound so lots of
people got them confused.  Most ALSA based distros failed to even
blacklist it by default so hotplug would load it preferentially to the
ALSA driver.  See the gazillion bug reports on the ALSA lists.
