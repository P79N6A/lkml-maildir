Reviewing your patch I spotted some locking inconsistencies.
Also Nikita Danilov have spotted a double unlock in irq_user.c:reactivate_fd(),
you forgot to do return before "out" label.
Below is quotes from the patch, and at the very end of the message
there is a my proposed patch to fix all uncovered problems, patch was tested
as in "compiles and runs ok for me".

Here you forget to unlock ubd_lock if dev->is_dir is true.

Here you forgot to do irq_unlock()
Also there are number "32" is hardcoded into arch/um/kernel/trap_user.c
in some arrays, taht you probably actually want to make dependent on
CONFIG_NR_CPUS
