But this will operate on the dup'd fd.  We detect that in the flush
(ignore) and ioctl (return errors) operations.  All other operations
are not handled by xpmem.
If you look at the fourth patch, at the beginning of the xpmem_flush
function, we have:
+       tg = xpmem_tg_ref_by_tgid(xpmem_my_part, current->tgid);
+       if (IS_ERR(tg))
+               return 0;  /* probably child process who inherited fd */
This will protect the xpmem structures of the parent from closes by
the child.
Thanks,
Robin
