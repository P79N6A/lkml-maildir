Fair enough as there isn't an oom killer in the kernel you're running :).
So it can kill unlucky tasks as well.
Since nobody cares to implement it, for 2.4.x on my TODO list there's an
alternative oom killer based on the task fault rate.
(btw, make sure you're using the -7 revision of the VM-global patch, as it
includes the same MM corruption bugfix that is been included into 18pre18)
