However, if you are using a Microsoft client to copy something large
over a slow WAN via SMB, you can kiss off using your machine for
anything else until the copy completes (I've observed this using Win95,
Win NT and Win98). If you are using a Samba client, you can at least
continue to use your machine of other work...
