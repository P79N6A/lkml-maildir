 Yeah, definitely.  Sorry. :-P

 And yes again.  I also thought it would look cleaner to implement
range checking using a wrapping argument.  But my rationales to include
them directly were
 1. Most driver parameters need range-checking.  I haven't seen many
    driver parameters which don't require range-checking.  The range
    values are also useful for non-integer parameters including strings
    and arrays.
 2. If we use separate range structure.  We would either
    - have two different sets (vanilla and ranged) of standard parameter
      set/get functions
    - or, end up using the wrapped version for both. (turning off range
      checking with some special value.)
    And both didn't look very attractive to me.  #1 is just not good
    and #2 seems a bit pointless as we'll always be using the wrapping
    argument for all types of paramters (integer, charp, string, array...).
 So, I folded range into the kernel_param structure.

 The thing is that the min, max values are used for all types
including signed and unsigned types.  min=MIN_MAX, max=INT_MIN will be
interpreted as a valid [INT_MAX, (unsigned)INT_MAX + 1] range for
unsigned int parameters.  So, I had to choose some value which,
regardless of type, maintains their relative relation, so the 1 and 0.
However, I do agree that plain 1, 0 doesn't look very clear.  How
about using something like the following?
#define PARAM_UNRANGED_MIN	1
#define PARAM_UNRANGED_MAX	0
or
#define PARAM_UNRANGED		1, 0
 I think it's better to be a bit feature-rich in module/device
paramter handling because by doing so we can avoid duplicated codes in
many places.
