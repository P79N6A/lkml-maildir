     Hi, all. I've been discussing the byte order that Linux/IA-64 will
   have with David Mosberger from HP. I'm arguing for big-endian to be
   used.
You mean that IA-64 can do either big or little endian, yet lacks a
way to specify alternate endianness in load and store instructions?
Tell me it isn't true.
Of course another advantage of big endian is for IP networking, no
byte swapping to do on header/protocol fields for every packet etc.
But honestly with today's cpu speeds the byte swapping is lost in the
noise in the TCP stack.
Later,
David S. Miller
