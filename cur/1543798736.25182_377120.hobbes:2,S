Dave, I think you meant "I don't think tasks can <strike>not</strike> be
permitted"...
Anyway, you make the constraints very clear, unless one can guarantee 
that the pidspaces don't have any overlaps in vpid usage, there is NOWAY
that we can allow this. Otherwise vpids that have been handed to 
to userspace (think sys_getpid()) need to be revoked (think coherence
here). That violates the transparency requirements.

Not only that, as the example of pids already show, while at the surface
these might seem as desirable features ( particular since they came up
wrt to the CKRM discussion ), there are significant technical limitation
to these.
