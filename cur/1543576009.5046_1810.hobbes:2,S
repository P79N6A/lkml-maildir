So mount it... It's not like you didn't have enough privileges for that,
after all, and mount("proc", "/proc", "proc", 0, 0); doesn't look too
complex.
OK, I can see the point of finding out where the console is redirected
to. How about the following:
	/proc/sys/vc -> /dev/tty<n>
	/proc/sys/console -> where the hell did we redirect it or
			     vc if there's no redirect right now
Will that be OK with you?
