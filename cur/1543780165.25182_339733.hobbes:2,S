In my last email, I stated that this discussion seems to have
demonstrated that the e1000 driver's netpoll is indeed broken, and needs
to be fixed.  I submitted eariler a patch for this, but it's untested
and someone who owns an e1000 needs to try it.
As for all the netpoll issues, I'm satisfied with whatever you guys
decide.  But I've seen lots of problems posted over the netpoll and
e1000, where people send in patches that do everything but fix the
e1000, and that's where I chimed in.
Thank you, my pants are dry now :-)
