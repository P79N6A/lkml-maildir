Assuming that the printk is for the correct filesystem, yes.

Well reiserfs shouldn't be doing this:
    bh = sb_bread (s, offset / s->s_blocksize);
    ...
    sb_set_blocksize (s, sb_blocksize(rs));
    brelse (bh);
but still, truncate_inode_pages() should be removing all those pages
unconditionally.

yup.

See the pinned buffer, above.

Yes, the page should have been removed from the mapping.
Amos, could you add this as well?
