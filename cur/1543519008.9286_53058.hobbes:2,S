No, almost all chipsets have DDC support meanwhile. Somethimes we
are considered slow, but we are not all that bad.

That's in the code now, too. You can use VESA bios to read DDC information.
However since not all bioses support VBE 2.0 one sometimes has to go
thru the HW directly. But you will find code for that in the 3.9.17
snapshot to be released around Xmas.

I don't consider my softbooter ready for the public, yet. It
doesn't even accept  arguments so you have to modify
the header and recompile. Therefor I haven't made it publically 
available, yet. So far it's only on the XFree86 developers ftp
site. 
I can give you a version however right now I'm working on
it so it is a total mess.
However it's a standlolone tool. What you need is a library like
lrmi. The version you've got is the same I have. From there to
reading out DDC is really a short step.
You probably should create a DDC library which can sit on top
of lrmi. (Library functions to do some other VBE operations would
be nice to have, too.) If later I turn my softbooter into a library
to would be easy to adapt.

You're welcome. Feel free to use my code. What is missing however is
a parser for EDID2.
