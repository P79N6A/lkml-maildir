Actually, a single session burn seems to work (I'm doing tests as soon 
as I get a compile of the latest kernel). What doesn't (or didn't) work 
is multisession, even with r/w "cdrecord -msinfo" fails, which is how 
you get the starting info for the next session.

I thought ide-scsi now did DMA, at least for data burns. Don't know 
about audio, I occasionally do an audio burn, but my main machine for 
burning uses ide-cd, so it's not an issue.
I saw a note somewhere about using capabilities on the cdrecord 
executable to allow the realtime sched to be set, but I don't seem to 
find it now. Maybe it was a question rather than an example :-(
