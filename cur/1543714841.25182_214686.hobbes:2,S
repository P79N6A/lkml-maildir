I have some numbers to clarify the 'improvement'.
Setup:
  ARM922 CPU, 200MHz, 32MiB RAM
  NFS mounted rootfs, tcp, hard, v3, 4K blocks
  Test application copies 41MiB file and prints the elapsed time
The two scenarios differ only in the setting of /proc/sys/vm/swappiness.
				 swappiness
			60 (default)		0
			------------		--------
elapsed time(s)		52.48			52.9
			53.13			52.91
			53.13			52.87
			52.53			53.03
			52.35			53.02
			
mean			52.72			52.94
I'd say that there is no statistically significant difference between
these sets of times.  However, after I've run the test program, I run
the command "ls -l /proc"
				 swappiness
			60 (default)		0
			------------		--------
elapsed time(s)		18			1
			30			1
			33			1
			
This is the problem.  Once RAM fills with IO buffers, the kernel's
tendency to evict mapped pages ruins interactive performance.
