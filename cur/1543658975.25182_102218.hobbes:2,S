Ok, I'll work on tracking down the exact patches where the changeovers
from 1->2 and 2->3 occur.  It's going to take me some time to
continually back out patches and rebuild, but I'll work on it.
Hopefully it will only take a couple days.
Any hints on ways to "move forward" as opposed to just moving
backwards would be useful too.
Thanks,
