ACPI is a bit of a red herring here; the int 0x15, eax=0xe820 BIOS
call has been around longer than the ACPI spec.  The ACPI people just
extended it with two new memory range types, to support their own
configuration information; code unaware of the ACPI spec. will see
those regions as unusable.
I haven't found any Pentium-class motherboard that does not support
this call. I have found older motherboards that don't, and one which
gives odd results ("Out of memory" error when the call is made!) -
which is one reason I didn't submit the patch when I wrote it.
It's probably safe to include the patch in the released kernel if it's
only included when compiling a kernel that will only run on Pentium
and above. It's only the code in setup.S that needs to be conditional;
the extended mem= parsing could be useful on all systems.
