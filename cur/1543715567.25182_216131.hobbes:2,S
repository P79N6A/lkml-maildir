I'm slowly and (somewhat) quietly cleaning up the libata internals. 
This is allow several interesting features to appear in rapid 
succession: hotplug, random taskfile submission (SMART!), and ATAPI.
This is the first step in cleaning up the internals.  Nothing terribly 
interesting for existing users, except for one key change:
Promise SATA driver has been split.  Promise TX2/TX4 SATA remains in 
"sata_promise".  The very-different Promise SX4 support is now found in 
a new driver "sata_sx4".  Promise users, please test and make sure I 
didn't break anything.  It seems to work on my Promise SATA h/w.
