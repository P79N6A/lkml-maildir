Sure. I only refuse to have it be "integrated" into the suspend - but it's
certainly perfectly fine to have "combination events", whether by having
special keystrokes that starts them or by having scripts or programs that
first do the sync and then do "echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep" or whatever.

I think it just does a "fsync_dev()", which will do the right thing for
network filesystems too.
But let's make an example: let's assume that I'm working on my laptop, and
the NFS server goes down so I decide to take a break. Should I not be able
to suspend, only because the sync won't finish?
That's the wrong answer. By _default_ I should just suspend, and when I
come back it will continue to try to write back the data (not by any
magical suspend/resume means, but just because that's what NFS does anyway
when the server hasn't answered)
