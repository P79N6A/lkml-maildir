You say your drivers are not that bad, OK, the kernel is not 
that bad too.
Now, please consider that this mainboard is about 10 years old.
How old is the PSU?
Consider whether the ambient temperature was higher than average
at time of lockup.
Please check:
1) CPU heatsink contaminated
2) CPU fan bad
3) PSU fan bad or contaminated (also PSU slots/fins)
4) Power supply instabel due to capacitors drying out
5) Mainboard CPU voltage instable due to capacitors drying out
6) Bad contacts at memory modules
7) Coroded PSU or other connectors
... Just some of the things I have encountered
Bottom line: its HW!
Your mail is helpful ;)
