Hmmm ... well I don't see bk4 on ftp.kernel.org, but the same
changes are in my tree ...  I've just checked it, and it doesn't 
do that for me. It should *allow* you to turn on CONFIG_NUMA 
(and that might be broken for PCs still) but it shouldn't be on 
by default ... could you check that you can still disable it?
Works for me ...

config NUMA
        bool "Numa Memory Allocation Support"
        depends on (HIGHMEM64G && (X86_NUMAQ || (X86_SUMMIT && ACPI && !ACPI_HT_
ONLY))) || X86_PC
