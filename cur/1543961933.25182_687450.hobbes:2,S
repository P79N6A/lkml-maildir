Assuming we did this, isn't it still possible to send SIGSTOP to every
task in the cgroup yet still appear to have not stopped every task in
the cgroup:
	Task A						Task B
echo 19 > signal.send
	record signal
	return -EBUSY from can_attach
	send signals to all the tasks
	return 0 from write syscall
						echo newpid > tasks
cat tasks
<Uh oh, not all tasks are stopped...>
