> +tristate 'Crash dump support' CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP
I"m very unhappy with this beeing a tristate.  We have the following
things depend on it either builtin or modular:
(1) build Kerntypes
(2) do not send smp_stop_cpu
and the following goes into dump.o:
(3) dump_base.c
(4) dump_<arch>.c
Of those (2) should be replaced by a dump_in_progress check so
that we poweroff even with dumping enabled, but not in progress.
The question is whether we should make (1) unconditional either
or make it a separate bool (CONFIG_KERNELTYPES) so that that dump.o
could be load into any such kernel.  But imho CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP
should just become a bool - this way dump_<arch>.c could be moved
into arch/<arch>/kernel and a lot of exports could be remove.
It's not much code either and the actual dump drivers stay modular.
