The other way around can be "demonstrated" equally trivially.
In my personal machine i have 3GB of RAM and i regularly create
DVD-ISO-Images (about 2 per day). After creating an image (reading up to
4,4GB and writing up to 4,4GB) the cache is 100% trashed(1). With swap
it would be even more trashed then it is without swap(1).
1: This has "always(tm)" been so since i began burning DVDs 3 years ago.
Beginning from kernel 2.4.4-2.4.25 and 2.6.4-2.6.6. Currently i use 2.6.5. (This is no typo!)
I have only tested the "with swap"-case with 2.4.4 as i didn't use swap
after 2.4.4 trashed so badly with swap enabled. But i don't think that
things have changed so fundamentaly that the "with swap"-case is
better(FOR ME!) than the "without swap"-case.
