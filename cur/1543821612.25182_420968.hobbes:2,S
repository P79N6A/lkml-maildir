Strange (but different) behavior also seen on a PE2650.

Done.  The bad patch was Badari's first vectored I/O patch.  Removing 
the patch fixes the badness on both systems.  I reported this to Badari 
late yesterday afternoon.
He hasn't seen this behavior in his test environment, which is only 
ppc64 and amd64.
