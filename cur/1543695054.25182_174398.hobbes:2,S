I just received my new Treo 600 yesterday, and I'm happy to report that
it has no problem syncing under the 2.6.0-test8 kernel.  The Treo 300,
on the other hand, still triggers the oops with 100% reliability.  I
expect to have access to the 300 for some time, so I'd be happy to
verify any fixes which are developed.
