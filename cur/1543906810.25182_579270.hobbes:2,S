So, to test... I put this in the application before every read:
    int flags;
    ioctl(modemFd, TIOCMGET, &flags);
    flags |= TIOCM_RTS;
    ioctl(modemFd, TIOCMSET, &flags);
and this after:
    int flags;
    ioctl(modemFd, TIOCMGET, &flags);
    flags &= ~TIOCM_RTS;
    ioctl(modemFd, TIOCMSET, &flags);
Now I can see the RTS light blink on the modem (and during heavy 
communication it merely "dims" depending on the amount of delay in the 
processing.
However, it does not help.  Data still goes missing.
Thanks,
Lee.
