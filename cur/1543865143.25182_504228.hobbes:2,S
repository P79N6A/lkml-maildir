Well, maybe not *blind* sharing.  But something more than the  
disconnect threads currently have with current->ioprio.
Today an existing kernel thread would most certainly ignore a  
sys_ioprio_set() in the submitter and then handle an aio syscall with  
an old current->ioprio.
Something more smart than that is all I'm on about.
