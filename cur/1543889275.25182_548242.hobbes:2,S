Subject: [PATCH 0/2] UML - Two bug fixes for 2.6.22
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/23/232

One of them is really more a workaround for a host bug than a UML bug
fix, but it does robustify the early boot checks a bit, and makes UML
boot on current FC6, so it's worth going in 2.6.22.
The other is a trivial error return fix in the ubd driver.
