Pavel, I don't even know where to begin, but I will suggest that you check 
your sources better. I did apply the patch to revert swsusp to the state 
it was in -test3. According to bitkeeper, it's ChangeSet 1.1217.3.31, 
which can be viewed here: 
http://linus.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/patch@1.1217.3.31
It was merged last Thursday night, which means it should have been in 
-test5-bk13. The changelog also appeared on the bk-commits-head list. 
Next, if you're going to patch my code, do *not* do crap like this: 
> +#if 0 
> +     /* Patrick is likely to s/swsusp_/pmdisk_/ in next release,
> +        but #if 0 is needed so that this compiles. */

I asked you several weeks ago to submit a patch that simply removed the
calls to swsusp. You did not, and you choose here to simply break it, and
add a bullshit comment to it.  
If you're going to 'fix' the code, take a minute to submit a patch that
does not add #ifdef's, and with a comment that actually makes sense to
someone other than you.
And, if you're going to submit a patch, please do so against the current 
release. 
	Pat
