It helps since now I avoid to waste 5mbyte of ram ;). And machines with
2mbyte of memory will try to take free 10 pages instead of 4 pages of ram.
4 pages is too low for such machines too.

See above.

I think freepages.* is dead. I just wanted to remove it but actually
nobody is hurted by it so I left it there for now.

I don't think ZONE_BALANCED make sense. It's not the fast path. Do the
thing right, use classfree and all become obviously correct.
If you are worried by the O(n) complexity of classfree reimplement it in
O(1) but I wouldn't use ZONE_BALANCED to skip the O(n) complexity when you
are lucky (not in the fast path).
