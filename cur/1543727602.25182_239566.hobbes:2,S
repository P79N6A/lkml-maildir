 From some output I prepared earlier :-)

iteration 0x1 etc are the separate passes through the loop.
The first squashfs_readpage is called via page_cache_readahead, which
reads pages 0, 1 and 2 (which is why no readpage is called in
iterations 2 and 3).  The second squashfs_readpage is called in the
fourth loop iteration by the 'goto no_cached_page' code path when no
page has been found by find_get_page, this is presumably because the
index is now out of bounds.
As I said in my previous email, I'm going to put an index
check into my code.  I don't want this argument to proceed
and myself to start (?) to look like an ass.
