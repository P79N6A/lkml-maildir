A couple of other advantages to freezing other processes:
1) It makes predicting how much memory is available for making and
saving snapshot a tractable problem. It therefore makes hibernation
_much_ more reliable.
2) Racing against other processes would also make hibernation slower,
increasing the chances of your battery running out before the save is
complete.
3) It makes finding potential memory leaks in the code possible. It was
ages ago now, but at one stage I could display a table saying exactly
how many pages had been allocated and freed by different sections of the
process and compare the number of free pages at the start and end of the
cycle to ensure there were no memory leaks at all.

I agree with Rafael. Freezing processes greatly helps in ensuring we
have a consistent image. He's right, too, in asserting that it's even
more important for Suspend2. Freezing processes is essential to being
able to know that those LRU pages won't change and therefore being able
to save them separately and then reuse them for the atomic copy.

I have had problems with MD threads generating I/O that I couldn't
account for - after userspace had been frozen, filesystems had been
nicely synced and so on. I have to speak with reservations though,
because I haven't yet gotten to the bottom of where the I/O is coming
from... too many things, too small time slices.

Yeah, so long as we bmap the storage we want to use beforehand (thinking
of swap files and ordinary files).

I have to disagree here. Freezing the disk instead of the threads is
dealing with the symptoms instead of the cause.
