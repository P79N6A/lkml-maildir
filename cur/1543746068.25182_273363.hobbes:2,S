The saa7146 driver seems to have a working solution for this
problem: The PCI ids are registered to the subdrivers (e.g. dvb-ttpci
or mxb)  so that these are loaded via hotplug. They then register to the
saa7146 core as an "extension" module, and the core then does the probing.
Grep for saa7146_register_extension().
