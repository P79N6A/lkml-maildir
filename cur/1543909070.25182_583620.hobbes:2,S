IMHO, it's still not proven the chipsets are to blame here
(plus read below).

Maybe I miss something, but:
- why it's not done in other places with handle_level_irq or
handle_fasteoi_irq. Are we sure they can never get IRQ_PENDING flag
or we take the risk?
- what about e.g. handle_simple_irq: do we think it needs resending
or simply going to wait for good bug reports?
- is this .status cleared enough on free_irq or during request_irq?
BTW, of course something like this set of patches was needed here,
but I still think this shouldn't be done this way: the bug wasn't
diagnosed nor tested enough, some chips are suspected, and
nevertheless the change is done for everybody, whithout any
possibility to set this back for people who had no problems with
2.6.21 and 2.6.22 (at least for some transition time). Maybe some
other chips get confused now, and we get some notice of this maybe
only in 2.6.25, if we'are lucky enough to have somebody like Marcin
around to do the next git bisection?
