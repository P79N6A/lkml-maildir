Here's the spot in the efi memory map that worried me:
4000000 - 4a54000 type=2 attr=b
4a54000 - ff80000 type=7 attr=b
The first of these two blocks is the space that Elilo allocated
to hold the kernel, the second is the remainder of memory in
the block of same-attribute memory.  In this case the boundary
is on a 16K boundary, so all is well.  But is this guaranteed
to work?
Booting a kernel with a 64K pagesize, I see:
4000000 - 4aa0000 type=2 attr=b
4aa0000 - ff80000 type=7 attr=b
So perhaps this is ok ... maybe the size of the kernel
will always come out as a whole number of pages?
But looking further down the map (on the 64K boot) I see:
180000000 - 1fedfa000 type=7 attr=b
1fedfa000 - 1fee00000 type=2 attr=b
1fee00000 - 1fee01000 type=7 attr=b
1fee01000 - 1fef56000 type=2 attr=b
1fef56000 - 1fefae000 type=1 attr=b
1fefae000 - 1fefb8000 type=2 attr=b
1fefb8000 - 1feffe000 type=1 attr=b
1feffe000 - 1ff454000 type=7 attr=b
1ff454000 - 1ff801000 type=4 attr=b
1ff801000 - 1ff8cc000 type=7 attr=b
1ff8cc000 - 1ff904000 type=4 attr=b
1ff904000 - 1ff908000 type=7 attr=b
1ff908000 - 1ff90a000 type=4 attr=b
Now these EFI areas all have the same attributes, but the boundaries
are not neatly aligned to kernel page size.
