Update:
The patch does seem to fix the crash.  This "different crash" I
mentioned appears to be related to the netconsole I was using (serial
console produces stairstepping text, netconsole seems to duplicate
lines--go figure).  Without netconsole, dynamic tick appears to be
working, so I'm not sure whether this is a netconsole bug or a dynamic
tick bug.
While dynamic tick no longer panics, with dynamic tick, my system slows
to whatever is slower than a crawl.  It now takes 6 minutes 50 seconds
to boot all the way up, compared to 1 minute 35 seconds with my 2.6.12
kernel without the dynamic tick patch.  I'm not sure where this slowdown
is occurring yet.
