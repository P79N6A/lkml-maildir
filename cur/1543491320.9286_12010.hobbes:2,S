Why is it silly?  Because it's not useful to you or any other kernel hacker?
Neither you nor any other kernel hacker can envision all the possible ways linux
might be used.   We find the patch _extremely_ useful in our production and test line.
It allows us to fully test and manufacture mutiple I2O LAN adapters in a single system and
it would be a lot more convinient if the patch was part of each linux instalation, rather than
having to compile a new kernel each time.
>This patch isn't needed. The bug is your routing table and trying to set up this configuration.
I'll have to disagree here.  Even if this patch is not useful to anyone else but us, it's still a kernel
bug.
Given the small patch size, and that it doesn't break anything else, I'm disappointed that you've
chosen not to include it.
