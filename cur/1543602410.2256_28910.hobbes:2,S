We are comparing synchronous to synchronous between 2.4.5pre1 and 2.4.10 so
I wouldn't expect such a difference.

I don't understand what the softirq is or how that could effect performance.
If you could point me in a direction to look, I'll check that out.

This was on my list of things to do, but I haven't gotten there yet. ;)
Working on it though.

I don't see me getting to this anytime in the near future.  If it will tell
me what I need to know, I'll add it to my to do list.
