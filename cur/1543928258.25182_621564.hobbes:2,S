Are I/O operations initiated by these "virtual CPU/GPU threads"?
If so, would it make sense to have per-CPU event handling threads
(instead of one global)? They would handle I/O operations initiated
from their respective CPUs to (hopefully) achieve better data locality
(esp. if the most part of the involved data is per-CPU).
Then let the load balancer to evenly distribute the "virtual CPU/GPU
threads" or even (at least, as an experiment) fix them to different
CPUs as well?
sure, the scenario is highly dependent on a nature of those
'events'... and I can just speculate here :-) (but I'd imagine
situations when such a scenario would scale better).
