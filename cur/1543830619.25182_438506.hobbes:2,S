There seems to be some real benefit to that.  Especially for things like NFS,
that captures the context at mount time. It might as well keep the namespace
in it's socket.

Given that we have two strong opinions in different directions I think it
is worth the effort to resolve this.
In a slightly different vein your second patch introduced a lot
of #ifdef CONFIG_NET_NS in C files.  That is something we need to look closely
at.
So I think the abstraction that we use to access per network namespace
variables needs some work if we are going to allow the ability to compile
out all of the namespace code.  The explicit versus implicit lookup is just
one dimension of that problem.

Thanks.

Basically most of the device list walker functions live in.
net/core/dev.c 
I don't know if the cases you fixed could have used any of those
helper functions but it certainly has me asking that question.
A general pattern that happens in cleanups is the discovery
that code using an old interface in a problematic way really
could be done much better another way.  I didn't dig enough
to see if that was the case in any of the code that you changed.
