Nick,
Thanks for that thought. I only recently found out about that. It led me
to interpret my problem wrongly the first time.
Unfortunately  this is not my problem. On a clean boot I can't mount the
64mb card in the reader, yet if I plug my camera in I can mount it there.
The 16mb card however mounts no problem in the reader.
As an alternative to the fix for the problem you see. Here is a link I
found that towards the bottom of the page has a solution. I haven't tried
it myself, but it might interest you.

If ever I get my problem sorted I'll give it a try myself.
