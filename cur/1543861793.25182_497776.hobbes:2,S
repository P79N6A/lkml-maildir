if you don't do this "fallback" thing the caller can just know it is
vmalloc due to the size... (and a 2 page kmalloc isn't going to fail on
you with GFP_KERNEL; also if you really want to deal with this failure
also tell the VM you're ok with failure (__GFP_NORETRY and such)...
but unless you do, things get a lot simpler by not doing this "fall
back" thing.
