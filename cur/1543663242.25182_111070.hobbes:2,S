Simply because several other projects I use have MCONFIG files, and I'm
used to the name.

Mine, actually: I don't like naming things Makefile unless it's OK to type
"make" in that directory.

Quite frankly, I think this is a bogus request.  The .pl extension flags
these, but if you think about it, there really is no difference between
"code" and "scripts that generate code" -- each is a form of source code,
just compiled by different programs.

No, that would completely suck.
usr/lib/tools would be semi-acceptable, but quite frankly I think it
really is just complexity for complexity's sake.  I also happen to believe
that when it comes to aestetic judgements (which *all* of these objections
are!) it should be primarily a choice of the people maintaining the code,
and perhaps Linus.
