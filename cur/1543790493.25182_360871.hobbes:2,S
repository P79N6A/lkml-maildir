Greg, 
Is this solution for nesting class devices considered permanent or is it
a stop-gap measure? I hope it is latter as these 2 new methods allow one
class device walk all over class's intended interface and semantics and
you can no longer rely that objects of the same class have similar
characteristics/attributes and similar behavior. You already had to
abandon using class's default attributes when dealing with nested devices,
I think it is wrong long-term solution.
What about Kay's proposal about moving (as far as userspace concerned)
everything into /sys/devices?
