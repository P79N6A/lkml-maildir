	In the case of the old Pcmcia package, there was a bunch of
options to take care of that, such as "cb_pci_irq". I didn't try yet
the old Pcmcia package to check if this option is working, because I
would need to recompile a kernel 2.4.X. But, if the old Pcmcia package
was able to do it, it's not impossible.

	Thanks a lot !
