If I leave more memory free by changing the argument to
malloc_all_but_x_mb(), then I have to increase the number of threads
required to trigger the deadlock.  Changing the thread stack size via
setrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK) also changes the number of threads that are
required to trigger the deadlock.  For example, with
malloc_all_but_x_mb(16) and the default stack size of 8 MB, <= 5 threads
will coredump successfully, and >= 6 threads will deadlock.  With
malloc_all_but_x_mb(16) and a reduced stack size of 4096 bytes, <= 8
threads will coredump successfully, and >= 9 threads will deadlock.
Also note that the "free" command reports 10 MB free memory while the
program is running before the segfault is triggered.
