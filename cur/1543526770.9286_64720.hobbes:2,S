This is what sockfs did that I wrote in 1997. The kernel side of the
patch was tiny and just added a function hook called when a privileged
socket was to be bound. A little pseudo-filesystem module then set that
hook and kept track of owner/permissions for each privileged socket. So
you could do
    mount -t sockfs none /sockfs
    ls -l /sockfs/53
and see it is "-rw------- root root" and then
    chown named /sockfs/53
You could also use chgrp and chmod g+w to make a bunch of port numbers
accessible to a particular group. Unfortunately, the kernel patch was
refused (I tried a few times) so I gave up. If you're interested, see
