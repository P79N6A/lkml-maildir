Obviously another comment missing.
 conf->expand_progress is sector_t and so could be 64bits on a 32 bit
 platform, and so I cannot be sure it is updated atomically.  So I
 always access it within a lock (unless I am comparing for equality with ~0).
 Yes, the result can become invalid, but only in one direction:  As
 expand_progress always increases, it is possible that it will pass
 logical_sector.  When that happens, STRIPE_EXPANDING gets set on the
 stripe_head at logical_sector.
 So because we took a reference to logical_sector *before* this test,
 and check for stripe_expanding *after* the test, we can easily catch
 that transition.
 Putting it another way, this test is to catch cases where
 logical_sector is a long way from expand_progress, the subsequent
 test of STRIPE_EXPANDING catches cases where they are close together,
 and the ordering wrt get_stripe_active ensures there are no holes.
Now to put that into a few short-but-clear comments.
Thanks again!
