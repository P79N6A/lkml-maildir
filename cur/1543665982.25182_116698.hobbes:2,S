You're missing the point. I am not against the CVS->BK gateway. I'm all
for it. But it's kind of sour given that he now wants to change the disk
format of the repo to make it harder to get the data from it.
If all he announced was "you now have a CVS->BK repo", I wouldn't be
complaining, I'd be patting him on the back.
