That's exaclt the way we should discuss it - you do ont like that
interface, but Ingo proposed a way to change that via table of async
syscalls - people asks, people answers - so eventually interface and (if
any) other problems got resolved.

So we just need to describe the way we want to see new interface -
that's it.
Here is a stub for async_stat() - probably broken example, but that does
not matter - this interface is really easy to change.
static void syslet_setup(struct syslet *s, int nr, void *arg1...)
{
	s->flags = ...
	s->arg[1] = arg1;
	....
}
long glibc_async_stat(const char *path, struct stat *buf)
{
	/* What about making syslet and/or set of atoms per thread and preallocate 
	 * them when working threads are allocated? */
	struct syslet s;
	syslet_setup(&s, __NR_stat, path, buf, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
	return async_submit(&s);
}
