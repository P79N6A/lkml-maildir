XFS's needs are simple - we're just sorting dirents within a
single directory block or smaller, and sorting EA lists/ACLs -
all of which are small arrays, so a qsort optimised for small
arrays suits XFS well.  Take care not to put any arrays on the
stack though, else the CONFIG_4KSTACKS punters won't be happy.
cheers.
