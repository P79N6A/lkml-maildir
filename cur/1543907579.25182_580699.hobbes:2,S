Yeah, till 2.6.22, libata didn't spindown disks on suspend or power off
which incremented emergency unload count on all normal systems, so only
the ACPI S5 routine is spinning down the disk on you system.  The
problem here is that now that libata is fixed there are two entities
trying to spin down the disk and the disk is dumb enough to spin back up
when FLUSH CACHE or STANDBYNOW is received while spun down.  :-(
Thanks.
