This is fixed. Please consider it as a user-bug if you want. 
Anyway, the fix was to enable :
"Intel Wireless WiFi Next Gen AGN"
in addition to the already enabled support for the iwl3945. 
Not sure why we now need to enable both, but this solved the problem
for me.
Wifi is now fully functional.
Regards,
Paul
