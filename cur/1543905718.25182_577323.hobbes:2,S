The motherboard manufacturer (well, their level 1 support, anyway) told 
me I could "safely enable the LAPIC". If it is safe to enable the LAPIC, 
then why are they disabling it in the BIOS? (They weren't able to tell 
me whether their BIOS triggers SMIs or not...)
Is this a "either works or doesn't" situation where hell should break 
loose if I try to enable the LAPIC and it's not supported by the 
motherboard, or is this a "you will silently lose data at the worst 
possible time" situation?

If that were the case, then I could not enable the LAPIC and have NMIs 
work, right?
