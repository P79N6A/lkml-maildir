Thanks for the pointer -- I had a look at this stuff.  It seems that
using the simple_transaction stuff is fairly heavyweight -- if I
understand correctly, every operation requires userspace to do
open()-write()-read()-close(), and also uses a page of lowmem.  I'm
not sure if this is the best fit for our requirements with InfiniBand
drivers: although the user->kernel calls are not in the data path,
there can still be quite a few of them.
On the other hand, ioctl() holds the BKL through the whole operation
so that's suboptimal as well.
Thanks,
  Roland
