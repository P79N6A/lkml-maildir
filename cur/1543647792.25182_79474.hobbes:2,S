	If, by this, you are saying that you have in mind some reason
why this should not be done, then please explain.

	Your patch does not apply and I don't see how renaming
a constant in essentially every place that it is referenced would
change the behavior of the code in a way releveant to the problem
that I described.
	I don't see a problem with device_shutdown spinning down the
IDE hard disks.  What I have a problem with, and what my patch fixes,
is the relatively new behavior of the warm reboot system call calling
device_shutdown.  Why was this added?  The reboot notifier chain is
already called for devices that need some preparation before it is
safe to reboot or halt.
