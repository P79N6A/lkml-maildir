Subject: [-mm patch] i386: enable 4k stacks by default
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch enables 4k stacks by default.
4k stacks have become a well-tested feature used fore a long time in
Fedora and even in RHEL 4.
There are no known problems in in-kernel code with 4k stacks still
present after Neil's patch that went into -mm nearly two months ago.
Defaulting to 4k stacks in -mm kernel will give some more testing
coverage and should show whether there are really no problems left.
Keeping the option for now should make the people happy who want to use
the experimental -mm kernel but don't trust the well-tested 4k stacks.
Additionally, make it more obvious that available stack space is not 
being halved.
