I have seen 
Aug 31 17:15:30 noose kernel: EXT2-fs error (device md(9,0)): ext2_add_entry:
	bad entry in directory #2875396: inode out of bounds - offset=51856
	, inode=69987932, rec_len=16, name_len=5

This was on a stripe of 3 UW SCSI Drives. 
I also have seen this (before the ext2 errors) ...

And 2 More disks like the last one ...
The first problem of ext2 errors i had after 2 days of Uptime
and ~1GB additional News traffic. So the corruptions seems
to be quite rare.
This is an AMD K6 300Mhz with a single 128MB PC-100 Dimm ..
No other known problems on that machine ... Running inn, postfix, listar etc.
