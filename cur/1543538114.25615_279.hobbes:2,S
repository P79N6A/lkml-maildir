I have had private confirmation that someone else with a .net address
stopped receiving posts on Saturday. When he resubscibed with a .com
address, all worked normally.
This happened some time ago... all the .net addresses out of order. It was
an exploder in (Finland?) which was out of whack.
Could someone please fix this?
Thanks,
John Alvord
