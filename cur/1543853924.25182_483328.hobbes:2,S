I have process which drops root privileges after startup and retains only 
some privileges using CAP_NET_ADMIN and CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities.
I can change values in /proc/sys/net/ipv[46]/* (like turning forwarding 
on/off) from this process using sysctl syscall, but I can't write 
directly into /proc/sys/net/ipv[46]/* from it.
