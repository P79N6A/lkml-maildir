Ahh, their web page says something different (either that or I'm just reading it
incorrectly). This graph was under the section heading of, "Dynamic Play", so I
assumed it was a graph showing a 4KB dynamically generated file.
Now if this was a static test, then the only difference between the first test
and the last test was the number of ethernet controllers used... and look at the
performance difference:
Linux 4KB static pages, 1 CPU, 1 Eth: 960 requests/second
Linux 4KB static pages, 1 CPU, 2 Eth: 1100 requests/second
NT 4KB static pages, 1 CPU, 1 Eth: 950 requests/second
NT 4KB static pages, 1 CPU, 2 Eth: 2000 requests/second
Then again, maybe it's just a poor english translation :)

Nice. I've been tracking Apache's two seperate development efforts (the apr and
mpm stuff) and it does look good, though PC Week said that Zeus (which I thought
used sendfile()) gave just about the same performance as Apache in their tests.
