You see improvements on the order of a percent or two IFF:
 - you do small reads
 - in a tight loop
Ergo, that benchmark was really not worth it either.

I mostly agree, although gettimeofday() under X is actually _the_ most
common one. But gettimeofday() is special anyway, simply because it
doesn't actually need to do a kernel entry, so the three you mention are
certainly "basic".
