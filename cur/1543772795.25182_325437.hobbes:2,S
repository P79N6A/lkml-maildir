Hmm. I don't like it very much as it mixes two different types of
devices (class devices and subclasses) into one directory.
I think it's cleaner to have two distinct class device types
(one for input_dev and one for input).
subclasses for the input class devices are a neat idea; but I fear the
hotplug event name will change for each subclass device ('input' will
become eg 'mouse'), so we again have to change all hotplug handlers.
And I don't see an easy solution for that ...
Cheers,
Hannes
