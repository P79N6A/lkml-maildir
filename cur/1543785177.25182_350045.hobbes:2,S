It's not so much a technical thing - I'll happily do git merges that fix 
bugs. But I don't want to merge big stuff (of course, it turns out that 
I'd missed a few before the release, so I did those anyway).

I'll happily take them. I'd suggest you include the patches themselves in 
the "please pull.." message, just to make it obvious what's going on, but 
it would be stupid to avoid using technical means to get the patches in. 
So I'll certainly go git merges for these kinds of things.
