Creating a null directory wouldn't work because a directory
is just a link to find a file. The actual file gets written
using the file-descriptor, without any reference whosoever
to the path. If you have root privileges, you can use
`mknod tempfile c 1 3` to create a null file with any
name you want. Unfortunately, somebody decided that
you need root privileges to execute mknod so ordinary
users can not do this.
