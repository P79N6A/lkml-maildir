Subject: [PATCH 1/7] uml idle thread needn't take access to init_mm
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Comparing this code which is the actual body of the arch-independent cpu_idle(),
it is clear that it's unnecessary to set ->mm and ->active_mm; beyond that, a
kernel thread is not supposed to have ->mm != NULL, only active_mm.
This showed up because I used the assumption (which is IMHO valid) that kernel
thread have their ->mm == NULL, and it failed for this thread.
