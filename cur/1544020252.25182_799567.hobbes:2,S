So is the right change to the epoll(7) page (see
http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man7/epoll.7.html
 )
to simply remive the text on max_user_instances:
       /proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_instances (since Linux 2.6.28)
              This  specifies  an  upper  limit on the number of epoll
              instances that can be created per real user ID.
Or are other changes also required?
Cheers,
Michael
