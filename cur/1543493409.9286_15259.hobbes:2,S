I have the follow questions for the TCP in Linux 2.2.5 kernel:
1) Is TCP Vegas still implemented in 2.2.5 kernel?
   if yes, how to enable it? If not, where can I find a Vegas
implementation for linux?
2) Is TCP FACK implemented in 2.2.5 kernel?
   If yes, how to enable it?
3) The default TCP in 2.2.5 kerenl is TCP Sack, If I disable it, 
   which TCP version Linux will use?
   Thanks
   Enguang He
