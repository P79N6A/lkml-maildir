The fact that not a script, but Linus Torvalds, decides that the tree is 
in a state he likes to share with others. You have been doing -pre's all 
this time, it's just that you are calling them -rc's.

You have no intent whatsoever to release your -rc1's as the next -final, 
so what is this private definition of "release candidate" we are not 
understanding?
Note, I am not complaining about 2.6. I think it's an absolute wonderful 
kernel, it works beautifully for me, I have no stability issues, but you 
indicated you wanted more testers for -rc and that's simply not going to 
happen when there aren't any real -rc's.
Rene.
