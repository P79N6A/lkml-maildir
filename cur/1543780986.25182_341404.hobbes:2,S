Thanks for comments and review - very helpful.

Ah OK, this wasn't initially apparent to me either, however I
believe it is needed.
Indeed we are protecting the internal nodes of the radix tree,
however the speculative get operation needs to dereference a
*pointer* to the page. The `struct page` itself doesn't go away,
and thus doesn't need any protection. However the *pointer* can
go away - it is contained within a radix tree node.

I believe this should answer your concern about the RCU protection
placement.
One thing we could do differently is this: instead of receiving
a pointer to the struct page from the radix tree lookup, we could
actually do as you say and push the rcu locking into the radix
tree lookup.
Then we would do a speculative get_page on that struct page,
finally we would lookup the radix tree again to see whether the
same page is still in the pagecache.
I discounted this idea not just for efficiency, but also because
it would require either a 2 phase speculative get (or a speculative
undo), or would require teaching speculative get about the pagecache
radix tree.

Great, thanks very much.
