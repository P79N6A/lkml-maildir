As I understand it, please correct me if I'm wrong:
Of the three variants: strcpy, strncpy and strlcpy.
- strcpy does not append \0 (unless the source string already contained it)
- strncpy appends \0's if the source string is smaller than the size
  parameter (for all remaining characters)
- strlcpy always appends a single \0 (unless size parameter was 0)
char *strcpy(char *dest, const char *src);
char *strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);
size_t strlcpy(char *dst, const char *src, size_t n);
In the original code strncpy was used and the size parameter was equal
to the source string size:
strncpy(dev->dev.bus_id, info->name, sizeof(dev->dev.bus_id));
Since this the size was equal there was no \0 termination. To \0
terminate using strncpy we could write:
strncpy(dev->dev.bus_id, info->name, sizeof(dev->dev.bus_id) - 1);
dev->dev.bus_id[sizeof(dev->dev.bus_id) - 1] = '\0';
or using strlcpy, which does the same thing:
strlcpy(dev->dev.bus_id, info->name, sizeof(dev->dev.bus_id));
