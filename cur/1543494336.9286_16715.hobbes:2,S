 I have been done a backup of a big subsdirectori tree from Linux, to the same
FAT32 partition:
tar zcvf cbuilder.tgz cbuilder ( aprox 300 MB of data)
When I finished backup the data, I trt to remove the directory cbulider (i
rm -rf cbuilder) and all is delected except the directory itself:
rm -rf cbuilder
rm: cbuilder: Device or resource busy 
????
The directory is empty and I don't know why this message. I have used tje
2.2.7 kernel, with vfat / msdos / etc as modules.
Thnaks in advance.
