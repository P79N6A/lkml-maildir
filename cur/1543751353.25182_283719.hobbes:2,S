Agree that's a problem. We just need an alternative interface here
or I try to come up with an x86-64 specific hack (I think it's possible
to do the compatibility x86-64 specific, just not in compat code for
all architectures who have truly separated user/kernel address spaces) 
I hope the USB people will eventually add a better interface here.

But that's a non issue for the new kernels affected by the new ioctl 
interface.

Did you submit a patch for that?  If not you should.

The magic 64bit interface isn't a very good interface, don't expect
that to be supported in the future.
