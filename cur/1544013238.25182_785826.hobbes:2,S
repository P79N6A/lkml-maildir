Subject: [PATCH] firewire: cdev: fix documentation of FW_CDEV_IOC_GET_INFO
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/2/112

The FW_CDEV_IOC_GET_INFO ioctl looks at client->device->config_rom, not
at the local node's config ROM.
We could fix the implementation or the documentation.  I believe the way
how it is currently implemented is more useful than the way how it is
currently documented, hence let's change only the documentation.
