'MkCDrec' makes a bootable CDs. Have look at it. It uses shells 
scripts only. So, it's easy to understand. If you want, I can mail 
you the initrd made by those scripts!
 If you're using Debian, have a look at bootcd-mkinitrd package !
 I suppose any live CDs  based distributions (like knopix) do such 
things too....
 By the way, this is not the correct ML for these questions. Please 
use a list based on your GNU/Linux distribution !
