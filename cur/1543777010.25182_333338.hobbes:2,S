Well, it's just the default settings of the kernel which has changed. If 
you want the old behaviour, you can use (with your admin hat):
echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/ondemand/ignore_nice
IMHO it seems quite fair, if you have a process nice'd to 10 it probably 
means you are not in a hurry.
Just by couriosity, I wonder how your processes are automatically 
reniced to 10 ?
