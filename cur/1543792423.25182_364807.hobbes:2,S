Can't hurt, and APM is largely obsolete because of ACPI, so I'm only 
concerned with trimming and keeping adequate protection of the kernel 
from APM code while maintaining correctness.  I don't have a nice set of 
old machines with enough wacky APM BIOSen to validate that unpinning the 
CPU is ok.
