And speakings as one of the people working with Linux on embedded boxes,
I'm thinking of even smaller systems, such as a minimal data-collection
system with just 2 MB of flash, 4 MB of RAM, and an ethernet port or 
serial port to send data upstream using IP.  And then you have the ucLinux
people aiming for even smaller targets.  
But it might be neccesary to stay with a stripped Linux-2.0 for the really 
small systems or fork a parallel development tree in the future since both 
aiming for really large servers and tiny embedded systemst might be a bit 
too much.  Do one thing and do it well.
