I'm sure your're right.   It's probably not just string operations. And maybe
then don't even dominate.
And I'm sure that vmstat doesn't use sh, awk, and perl either.
Anyway, the efficiency issues was mainly me getting side-tracked from the main
issue as I see it.
The point I wanted to make was, that we need an interface thats possible to
parse "correctly", not "mostly correctly", and we need to be able to parse it
in a way so that we do not have to rely on a myriad of small tools (that change
over time too).
You need something that's simple and correct.  If it's ASCII, well let it be
ASCII. But /proc as it is today is not possible to parse reliably.  See my "cat
vs. c)(a" example.   You can parse it "mostly reliable", but that's just not
good enough.
