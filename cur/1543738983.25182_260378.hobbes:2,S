Compiling with -fomit-frame-pointer removes information from the
binary that could be used for debugging. So the bugbuddy information
you provided was not optimal, because it lacked the crucial stuff. ;-)
The flag does not cause any problems, it is routinely used for
compiling stuff  that doesn't need debugging.
