What I mean is that we will then do the full priority inheritance boost 
with interrupts off.
Before setscheduler() was O(1), now it is O(<lock depth of what ever lock 
the target task might be locked on>).
This is not a problem for your use of setscheduler() as the task involved 
only can be blocked on kernel mutexes, but when the function is used on a 
userspace process the lock depth can be deep.
