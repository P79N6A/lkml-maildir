Subject: [PATCH 0/2] [TRIVIAL] Small cleanups for do_path_lookup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The following 2 patches are trivial cleanups to do_path_lookup in namei.c.
Since these changes are trivial, they can go into 2.6.22-rc1 without any
problems.
Josef 'Jeff' Sipek (2):
      fs: Fix indentation in do_path_lookup
      fs: Use path_walk in do_path_lookup
diffstat for good measure:
