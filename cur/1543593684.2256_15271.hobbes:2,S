So how would you get persistent caching across reboots which is one of
the major advantages of a cachefs type filesystem. I guess you could tar
the cache on startup and shutdown although would be a little slow :).
I think 'speed' here means faster than NFS or other network filesystems
- you obviously have the overhead of network traffic for cache-coherency
but can avoid a lot of data transfer (even after a reboot).
