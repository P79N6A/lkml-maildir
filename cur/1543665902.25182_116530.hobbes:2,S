Yes, it is. However, Paul Gortmaker reported on his old 700MB
Maxtor 7850 AV that would give errors with 256-sector requests
and work well with 255-sector requests. In a later post he
added that one has to work hard to evoke this error - usually
256-sector requests are fine, but after torturing the disk with
an hour of simultaneous untar and make, an error occurred.
Maybe that is the only disk that gives problems.
Jens replied:

= a good idea to leave it at 255 just for safety
So that is how this length was limited.
In short: 256 is legal, has always been legal, nothing wrong with it.
But at least one old disk has been discovered that was happier with 255.
