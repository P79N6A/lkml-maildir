Sure.. one is "allin1" a dockapp, one is cpufreqd (which polls the ac adaptor and not the battery), 
then we have  and the other is a script I wrote to poll every 60s or so to tickle my suspend script 
when the battery drops to 5%
When I really want to beat it up I have another script (which is the 2s poll) that estimates battery 
time remaining based on the delta of each percent drop in battery time (as my retarded acpi bios 
just estimates it based on a 4 hr runtime with a linear division of the % left)
I've modified allin1 to poll about once a minute. I have to look closer at cpufreqd to see how that 
one polls yet.
Regards,
Brad
