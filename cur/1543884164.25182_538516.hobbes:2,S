So your performance is good when you add combined_mode=libata?  I hope 
so, because that's why I added it in the first place...
However, Jeff's patch won't steal your performance as long as you make 
sure you use the libata based drivers for everything.  If you're 
running Fedora I think the rawhide kernels are configured this way, but 
the fc6 era kernels aren't.
