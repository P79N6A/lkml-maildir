Hello,
      We have a requirement that a filesystem has to support
encryption based on some policy. The filesystem also should be able 
to store data in non-encrypted form. A search on web shows a few 
encrypted filesystems like "Crypto" from Suse Linux, but we need a
system  where encryption will be a choice per file. We have a hardware
controller to apply encryption algorithm. If a filesystem provides hooks
to use a hardware controller to do the encryption work then the cpu can
be freed from doing the extra work.
Any comment on this?
