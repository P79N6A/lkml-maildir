In userspace programs, no.  But the C library has needed to include the kernel 
headers because there was nothing else defining the kernel ABI, and there 
still isn't in the actual kernel tarball.

No, but I do expect the kernel to provide some way to bind to its ABI, and I'd 
expect the change you're proposing to be to be a 2.7 issue if no alternative 
has been presented yet for things that currently DO need the kernel headers.  
(Or is the official word that everybody must install this glibc package to 
use a 2.6 kernel?)
The new kernel ABI headers mentioned here don't seem to exist yet, yet what 
I'm hearing is that we're not just supposed to deprecate the old ad-hoc way 
of doing things, but completely stop using it immediately.  What exactly is 
the benefit of this supposed of to be?
Or are you saying that glibc will be the only C library supported for use with 
2.6, and uclibc users should wait until 2.7?

The message everybody quotes from Linus to stop having the asm symlink point 
into /usr/src/linux came out during the 2.4.0-test series.

Now we're in 2.6.0-test and there's another change coming.  Fine.  What's the 
alternative?  If the replacement isn't ready, then this is a 2.7 thing rather 
than what people will actually be doing under 2.6.
Or are you saying linux-kernel should punt and the glibc guys are now going to 
define the linux kernel ABI for 2.6?

I'm all for doing it in 2.7.  I just want to know what I should do for 2.6.  
If there's a consensus that we're talking about 2.7 and allowing ad-hockery 
to continue in 2.6, I'll shut up. :)
