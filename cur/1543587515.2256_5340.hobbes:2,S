It would be nice if chrdev_open were added to ksyms.c along with
blkdev_open since tape devices seem are always registered as character
rather than block devices.  
I am finding that kernel modules that need to open and close a tape 
drive have to export chrdev_open manually on 2.4.3.  Can this get 
exported as well?  Closing is not a problem since the method of 
calling (->release) seems to work OK with SCSI tape devices.
