tclib as a clocksource should be no problem on Preempt-RT, do not use
it as clockevent device, it will not work properly on preempt-rt on
at91* yet, especially with the NO_HZ config.

I am still very curious to your (RT-) thread-prio layout. The problems
you mention can also be caused by a weird configuration of these
threads on preempt-rt.
