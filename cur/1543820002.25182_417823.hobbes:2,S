In this case it's sort of necessary - unless you're suggesting I make FS-Cache
mandatory...
The problem is that I don't want NFS or whatever to be carrying around the
cookie pointers if FS-Cache isn't compiled as that saves memory.  But that
involves conditionally changing the composition of structures, something
that's most clearly done with cpp-conditionals.
