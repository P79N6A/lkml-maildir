I'm not going to pretend to understand the buffers issues here:
people thought that change was safe originally, and I can't say
it's not - it just stood out as a potentially weakening change.
The patch you propose certainly looks like a good way out, if
that moved unlock really is a problem: your patch is very well
worth trying by those people seeing their corruption problems,
let's wait to hear their feedback.
Thanks!
Hugh
