Hi Con
I just played with your SCHED_ISO patch and found a simple way to crash
my machine.
I'm running this as unprivileged user with SCHED_ISO:
main ()
{
        while(1) {
                sched_yield();
        }
}
The system hangs about 3s and then reboots itself.
2.6.11-rc1 + 2.6.11-rc1-iso-0501182249 on an UP Athlon XP.
With real SCHED_FIFO it just lockup the system.
