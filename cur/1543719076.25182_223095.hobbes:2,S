Right now it happens with 2.6.5-mm5. It has happened with all 
2.6.x(-mmY) I've tried. But as it seems
after reading Con's reply - this is known problem. So I won't send any 
vmstat/schedstat outputs unless
explicitly requested.
Although I agree with Con, that acroread/gecko should be fixed (because 
in-kernel
solution for this problem doesn't exist/is hard to do) some measures 
should still be implemented kernel-side
to at least soften the effects (it's kind of DoS for servers having 
acroread plugin installed and there
might be other apps/ways to trigger this although not known today).
