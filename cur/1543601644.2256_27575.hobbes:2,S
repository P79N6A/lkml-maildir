Essentially.  Though that is just the strategy it doesn't cut to the heart of the
problems that need to be addressed.  The trickiest part is to allocate persistent
id's to the pages that don't require us to fragment the VMA's.

Agreed.  
What I find interesting about the 2.4.x VM is that most of the large
problems people have seen were not stupid designs mistakes in the VM
but small interaction glitches, between various pieces of code.
