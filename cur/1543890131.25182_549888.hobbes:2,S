If someone explicitly mounts "-o barrier" and the underlying device
cannot do it, then we want to issue a warning or reject the
mount.

Ok. But you also seem to be implying that there will be devices that
cannot support barriers.
Even if all devices do eventually support barriers, it may take some
time before we reach that goal.  Why not start by making it easy to
determine what the capabilities of each device are. This can then be
removed once we reach the holy grail....
Cheers,
Dave.
