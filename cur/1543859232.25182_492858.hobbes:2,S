I've also already experienced I/O loads due to rsync. The most annoying
part certainly being that most of the connections see nothing new, but
the disks are seeked anyway, and the cache always gets trashed. A dirty
but probably efficient emergency workaround would be to randomly refuse
a few rsync connections on www1. It would make the mirroring tools fail
once in a while, and the data would be mirrored in larger batches, so
all in all, it would reduce the rate of useless disk seeks.
Since I suspect that the volume of data transferred by rsync is fairly
moderate, it might be interesting to load balance the rsync between the
two machines, even if that involves making the data transit via the net
twice. I can help setting up a reverse proxy setup if you want to give
a try to such a setup.
Best regards,
Willy
