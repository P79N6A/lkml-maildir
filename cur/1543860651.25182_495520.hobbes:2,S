OF device tree properties are "properly typed" just fine -- it's
just that only the intended consumers of the data know what to
expect, you certainly can't derive the data structures from just
looking at the data in one instance of a property.
Put another way, if you know what you are looking for in the
device tree, you can decode a property just fine -- if you're
given a random property on the other hand, you can never get
any better than the generic property structure of "array of bytes".
