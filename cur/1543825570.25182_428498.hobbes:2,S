Yann,
Can you please use a sane mail client ? There is no point to have the
headers of the previous mail inserted in some fancy way. Also please
answer inline and not on top of the reply.
Thanks.

Hmm. Is that part of your code or is it related to code in mainline ?

Why should that be done. The gpio_irq_handler should be called from the
demultiplexing handler, via desc->handler(..). ARM has a conversion
macro - desc_handle_irq() for that.
Anyway, the ARM code in 2.6.16-rtXX is lacking some of the changes we
did in the genirq patchset. Sorry: - ENOTENOUGHINSTANCES
I'm in the progress to update that.
