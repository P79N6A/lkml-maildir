Many thanks for pointing this out.
It was a stupid mistake by me. I have now put a new version of the
patch in the same place.
I should have paid more attention to Stanislav Voronyis's patch that
went into 2.2.0. My excuse is that I first did this stuff for 2.1.132,
when it was necessary to change console.c. Anyway, this new version
changes fewer files so it is safer, I hope.
