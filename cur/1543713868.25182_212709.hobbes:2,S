Subject: [PATCH]: 2.4/2.6 do_fork() error path memory leak
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

In do_fork(), if an error occurs after the mm_struct for the child has
been allocated, it is never freed. The exit_mm() meant to free it
increments the mm_count and this count is never decremented. (For a
running process that is exitting, schedule() takes care this; however,
the child process being cleaned up is not running.) In the CLONE_VM
case, the parent's mm_struct will get an extra mm_count and so it will
never be freed.
This patch against 2.4.25 should fix both the CLONE_VM and the not
CLONE_VM case; the test of p->active_mm prevents a panic in the case
that a kernel-thread is being cloned.
It looks from the code that the problem exists in 2.6 as well; I can
send a separate patch for that, if necessary.
