Doesn't do much good if one of the compilers generates bogus output,
but obviously you never had to deal with the bug reports coming out of
distributors shipping $#@%$# pgcc as their default compiler. Mandrake
6.0 was a disaster in this regard, people would mail you saying they
used a standard RH6 to compile and the code didn't work, you made them
use a working compiler (ie. not the pgcc crap) and the code suddenly
worked just fine. Fortunately Mandrake becamse wiser and threw it
away.
Looks to me like Alan's plonk was very appropriate here.
