I will imagine that we will see cleanup patches converting
these back to inline/asm.
How about doing this conversion as part of the headers_install.pl
script so we know it is always correct?
Then we can keep the familiar inline/asm in the kernel headers
and always use the correct __asm__, __inline__ version for our
exported headers.
