Hi,
Just wanted to know if the following conclusions are 
right:
generic_plug_device function queue's a task (with 
the generic_unplug_device routine to be executed) in 
the tq_disk queue. 
The __generic_unplug_device function(called from 
generic_unplug_device) calls the request function 
when the task is scheduled (crossed some limit of
buffers) or when free requests are not available.
Besides the above there is no other place where 
unplugging i.e. running of tasks in the task queue 
tq_disk is done.
