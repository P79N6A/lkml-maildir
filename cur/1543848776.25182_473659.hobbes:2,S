I see you devoted a lot of work and time to this testing
and for sure it will help people who read this to
diagnose similar problems but I think it could be even
more valuable if you'd try (after some rest!) to find
if "Enable CPUfreq debugging" plus adding to kernel
command line cpufreq.debug=<value> (according to help
screen) would return any error messages that could be
send to bugzilla and/or cpufreq maintainer.
