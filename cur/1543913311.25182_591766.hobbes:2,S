Hi Zach,
	I don't think this patch does anything.  The flush is because we want
the just-completed "set_pte" to have immediate effect, so if preempt is
enabled we're already screwed because we can be moved between set_pte
and the arch_flush_lazy_mmu_mode() call.
Now, where's the problem caller?  By my reading or rc4, vmalloc faults
are fixed up before enabling interrupts.
Confused,
Rusty.
