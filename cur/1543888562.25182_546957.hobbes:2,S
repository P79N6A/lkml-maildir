First of all, this isn't an either/or kind of thing nor should it be thought
of in that way.
Precise file/function/line placement for one thing. My patch is specifically
for -rt which does checks that Peter's doesn't and is needed to characterize
-rt better. My stuff is potentially more extensible since I have other ideas
for it that really are outside of the lockdep logic currently. These can be
unified, but not so that one overrides the intended features of other. That's
why I was hessitant to completely unify with lockdep in the manner you
suggested.
