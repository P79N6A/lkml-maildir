You seem to be missing most of the issues people raise:
perhaps your spamfilter is too eager.
Where is Brice Goglin's #include <asm/apic.h> in mce_intel.c?
i386 machine_check_init misses calling mcheck_init in Intel
and Centaur cases, so a lot of the code is largely untested.
You need to avoid the P6 and AMD problems with bank0,
as the replaced code did.
I fear there may be more.
