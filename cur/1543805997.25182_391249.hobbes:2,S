The motherboard's an ASUS CUV4X, with VIA almost-everything. I think
this is the first mobo I've had in a decade that doesn't even have an
Intel PIIX bridge on it.
(One other machine in the house has VIA almost-everything as well, and
exhibits none of these problems.)

That's specific to one port. As the capture (from the server side this
time) shows, the NFS client is using all sorts of ports on the client,
and port 2049 on the server; acks are not required, this being UDP.
I'm going to rebuild with NFS-over-TCP support and see if that changes
anything next. A bit pointless on a clean switched network, but it's
hardly going to be noticeable...
I'll get another network card on Monday and swap out the DP83815, and
see if *that* changes anything.
