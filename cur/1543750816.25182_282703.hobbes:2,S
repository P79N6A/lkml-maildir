On a dual-Opteron w/ NUMA I had to apply the Jesse's patch to compile the 
kernel, but it does not boot.  It only prints this to the serial console:
Bootdata ok (command line is root=/dev/sdb3 vga=792 earlyprintk=ttyS0,57600 
console=ttyS0,57600 console=tty0)

and then it goes into an infinite loop that writes some garbage to the 
framebuffer (yellow lines on top of the screen).
On a UP AMD64 it boots, but then it does not work appropriately (eg. at KDE 
startup the box hangs for a while and I get the message like "The process for 
the file protocol has terminated unexpectedly" and desktop icons are not 
displayed, and I get a "cpu overload" message from arts etc.).
Please let me know if you need more information.
