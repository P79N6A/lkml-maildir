A new development version of the Tulip ethernet driver for 2.4 kernels
has been posted at 
	
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tulip/
This version incorporates a number of fixes which I would like to get
tested heavily before incorporating into the kernel.  Update summary is
in tulip.txt in the driver tarball, as well as a more technical
ChangeLog listing all changes.
The driver requires kernel 2.4.3 or later.
Feedback is welcome.  I'm especially interested to know if this driver
fails to work on any -working- 2.4 configurations (it shouldn't). 
Please report bug to the bug tracker on the web page listed above.
Thanks all, and viva la open source!
