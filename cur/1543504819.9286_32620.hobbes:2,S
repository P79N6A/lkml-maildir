Personally I really like info better than HTML and man, because with
emacs it's very easy to browse with the keyboard, you can search the
whole file (you can't search in nested HTML-files), copy text from the
info file into another emacs buffer, use incremental search (C-s in
emacs) and the font and background is your favorite and so it's
easyest to read on your screen.
But I hate the info-program to display info-files because you can't
use it intuitively.
This may also be true for people who don't use emacs but with Texinfo
you can make info, ASCII text, HTML and TeX. So a Texinfo
documentation should meet everyone's needs. The same is true for the
linuxdoc SGML documentation system.
I think the documentation for gcc, glibc, make etc. is all in Texinfo,
so you can make HTML easily from it.
