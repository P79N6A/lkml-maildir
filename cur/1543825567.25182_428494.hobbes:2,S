And it can be done.  The matrox driver in 2.4 can do just that.  For 2.6,
we have tileblitting which is a drawing method that can handle pure text.
None of the drivers use this, but vgacon can be trivially written as a
framebuffer driver that uses tileblitting (instead of the default bitblit).
I believe that there was a vgafb driver before that does exactly what you
want.

Most drivers do not change the mode at startup.  Do not load fbcon, and
you will retain your text mode even if a framebuffer is loaded.  This is
not a hard and fast rule, so some drivers, especially those in embedded,
will explicitly change the mode at startup, that's a developer choice.

And a few drivers already do that, i810fb and rivafb.  Load rivafb or i810fb,
switch to graphics mode, unload, and you're back to text mode. The main problem
is that fbcon cannot be unloaded, but it's again trivial to rewrite fbcon so it
can be unloaded.  What prevents me for doing the rewrite is that only a few
drivers restore the hardware to text mode.
And this is one argument against making vgacon the primary console driver.
It does not have the capability to reset itself, it has to be done by
an external driver, whether by X or fbdev.
