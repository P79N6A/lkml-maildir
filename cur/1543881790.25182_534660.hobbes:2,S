It is not. But i think that is a lesser problem, the bigger question is:
Why would you need to change a qdisc just so you can support egress
multiqueues?
BTW, is there any reason this is being cced to lkml?

PS:- I havent read the kernel patches (i am congested and about 1000
messages behind on netdev) and my opinions may be influenced by an
approach i have in trying to help someone fixup a wireless driver with
multiqueue support.
