Sure, if you're rendering times are minutes or hours. It doesn't
matter if it takes 10 milliseconds to grab a lock. But if your
rendering times are a fraction of a second, 10 ms here and 10 ms there
starts to hurt.
So applications which have a habit of grabbing locks over DSM are not
going to scale well (scale in the opposite direction that people are
used to thinking about).

I don't agree that it's "obvious". The timescales also matter.

Agreed.
