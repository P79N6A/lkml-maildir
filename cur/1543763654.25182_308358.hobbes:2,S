SPARC64 can do it in the PTEs, but we just use raw physical
addresses in our I/O accessors, and in those load/store instructions
we can specify the endianness.
Be careful though.  Endianness can be dealt with on a hardware
level.  Consider a byte access to a 32-bit word sized config space
datum, the PCI controller on a big-endian system will likely byte-twist
the data lanes in order for this to work properly.
It's a subtle issue, and it's explained pretty well in some of the
UltraSPARC PCI controller docs at:

In particular, "U2P UPA to PCI User's Manual", chapter 10
"Little-Endian Support", has some informative diagrams.
