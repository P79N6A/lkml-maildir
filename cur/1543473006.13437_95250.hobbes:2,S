Hello,
        I honestly think that the whole linux community owes a certain
respect to redhat. OK, they are, in some way pushing the rights that the
GPL offers and making money out of the work of Linux, Alan and all the
developpers of the kernel (and GNU for that matter), but, they offer a
serious alternative to microsoft, and they are taking linux out of our
basements, and in to the market place. Because of redhat, I can hope to
work in a Linux environment full time some day because of all the commercial
applications that are now prting to Linux.
        I personnaly prefer to get free applications and get them to work for
my self, but, what about bigger enterprises that want reliable support ?
They should be entitled to have some, if they want to pay for it. And redhat
is offering just that opportunity. And, most of all, they allow us Linux
users the opportunity to get a little more known, and, maybe (just maybe)
some day we will be offering Bill a little competition and he will be forced
to produce more efficient software, instead of just good looking one.
                                This is of course just an oppinion,
                                so I hope I don't offend anybody.
