Yeap, we certainly need the workaround.  I was just having a little fun.

I see.

Yeah, I noticed the difference.  I don't really care but I was thinking
that SERR_INTERNAL might be set in other similar situations too.  e.g.
TF error from ATA device or what not, so I thought it would be safer to
ignore the bit altogether.  You probably need to consult your hardware
people about when exactly the bit misbehaves but unless proven
otherwise, I'd prefer to always ignore the bit.  Also, please rename the
enum constant and flag name.
Thanks.
