This is a wrong impression.
The bug fixing of reiser4 is definitely better than the average in the 
kernel. If you wanted to get e.g. the SATA drivers removed from the 
kernel, bug handling might be a point in favor of the removal. But 
that's not a problem with reiser4.

    Gentoo kernels are 42 times more popular than SUSE kernels among

    gathers data about kernels from many users worldwide).
