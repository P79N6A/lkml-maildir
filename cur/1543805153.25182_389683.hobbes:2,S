Please see the original mail from Al on this subject.  We need to
split the "am I allowed to write to the fs" part out of permission().
Once we're at it we can pair it with the "don't need to write to fs anymore"
even and get saner unmount/remount semantics.
To get there we will still need the vfsmount propagatios, so these should
come first in the series.  Then the get/release write access helpers and
last the actual per-mount ro bit.  Your mnt_flags propagation fix is fine
on it's own and should go in asap.
And please send the patches to -fsdevel and in the proper patch format.
I have planned to look at this again in February, tell me if you want to
finish it before or at the same time, then I won't spend time on it.
