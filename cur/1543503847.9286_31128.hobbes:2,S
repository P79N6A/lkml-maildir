There's only one very small piece of video capture that needs to be
realtime - ie worst case performance of a few milliseconds. That's the
piece that sets up the DMA transfers for grabbed frames. That piece
belongs in a driver, not an application. The remainder, ie queuing and
unqueuing buffers, postprocessing, and spooling to disk, all can be done
in application space and rely on the system's buffers. If it can't make it
to disk without overrunning memory in that environment, it wouldn't make
it anyway.
