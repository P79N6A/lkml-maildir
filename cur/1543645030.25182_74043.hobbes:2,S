Okay, I followed those steps, and gave /mnt a fairly good fsstress'ing. No FS 
errors were encountered during the run. Upon umount and fsck, I got the 
following error:
"Problem in HTREE directory inode 2 (/): bad block number 3617593."
fsck then "optimized" inode 2 in pass 3A. Will beat up the filesystem some 
more ;)
