Greetings;
The recently increased verbosity in the dmesg file is causeing the 
"ring buffer" to overflow, and I am not now seeing the first few 
pages of the reboot in the dmesg file.
I understand this 'ring' buffer has been expanded to about 16k but 
that was way back in 2.1 days when that occured according to the 
Documentation.
Is there any quick and dirty way to increase this to at least 32k, or 
maybe even to 64k?  With half a gig of memory, this shouldn't be a 
problem should it?
I've done some grepping, but it appears I'm not grepping for the right 
var name, so I'm coming up blank and need some help.
