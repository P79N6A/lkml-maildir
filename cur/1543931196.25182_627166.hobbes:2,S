"=A" works on 32-bit systems (only), obviously, and gcc will generally 
produce slightly better code as a result (gcc could really use a 
register renaming/copy propagation step *after* multi-register entities 
are broken apart, at least on architectures which don't have register 
pairs as a hardware constraint.)
