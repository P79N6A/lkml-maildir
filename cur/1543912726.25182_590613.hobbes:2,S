Thanks for the analysis.
In theory we could not fail DAC if the machine has <4GB RAM to work around
such buggy drivers, but then they would fail anyways with >4GB. Also
the failure was intended to allow some drivers to use more efficient non DAC
operation.

The reason I blacklisted all was that there was a small triple of data corruption
reports with VIA bridges. Also it's impossible to get any errata information
out of VIA. And there are not that many >4GB VIA systems because these
chipsets are usually used in lower end systems.
