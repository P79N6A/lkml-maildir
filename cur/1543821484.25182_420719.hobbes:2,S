Yes, that's the way I originally made it, and I switched it back
to that in the latest patch.

I feel you're missing one thing though, we need PPC_CELL_NATIVE.  We
don't want to build that in if we don't need it.  Here's what I setup:
PPC_CELL = make descends into platforms/cell
PPC_CELL_NATIVE = add bare metal support
PPC_IBM_CELL_BLADE = add blade device drivers, etc.

Yes, that's the whole idea of this patch.  It comes from my patch set
'cell: support multi-platform image'...  But we also need to be able
to build in only the support needed.  This is an important requirement
for consumer products, to reduce the image size.
In a certain class of products the kernel image and read-only parts
of the file system are stored on flash.  A smaller kernel means more
space for applications.  Also, a smaller kernel image loads faster.
Device startup time is very important for many consumer products.
