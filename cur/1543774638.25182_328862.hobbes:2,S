That just means the zip plugin has to be more carefully written than I
thought.  It would have to be sandboxed and limited to prevent buffer
overruns and zip bombs.
I think that you could create a situation where an untrusted zip could
be explored, and the worst side effect would be that the files you see
inside the untrusted zip wouldn't be what you expect.  But that's no
surprise -- if the zip is really malicious, there's no amount of
sandboxing that would give you valid files anyway.
I was probably taking this too lightly, though.
Remember that zip, at least, would not be in the kernel.  I think what
is going in the kernel is gzip and lzo, and it's being done so
transparently that you never actually see the compressed version.

I am doing that out of habit.  Actually, it probably ends up more as:
  .../foo.zip/
instead of
  foo.zip/.../
But, it is left out.  At least that interface.
Now, the cryptocompress as it currently stands does not involve ... and
does not introduce any new security holes in the way that you are
describing.  There might be some issues with key management (someone
hinted vaguely at that), but nothing insurmountable.
