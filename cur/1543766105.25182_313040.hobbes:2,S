I agree with you.  It was a bug.  There are a lot more bugs in the
generic write code paths.  I have been analysing the code quite
thoroughly because I am reimplementing it in NTFS and am shocked that a
number of bugs in the generic file write code paths have gone unnoticed
for ages (I guess since they only affect seldom traversed code paths).
When I have the time I will be cooking up patches but it might be a
while.  And perhaps someone else will fix them before I get to them so
here are a couple of examples off the top of my head...
mm/filemap.c::file_buffered_write():
- It calls fault_in_pages_readable() which is completely bogus if
@nr_segs > 1.  It needs to be replaced by a to be written
"fault_in_pages_readable_iovec()".
- It increments @buf even in the iovec case thus @buf can point to
random memory really quickly (in the iovec case) and then it calls
fault_in_pages_readable() on this random memory.  Ouch...
Best regards,
        Anton
