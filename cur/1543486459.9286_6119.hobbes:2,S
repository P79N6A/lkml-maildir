Wrong! The netmask is correct. So is the one written automatically when
the interface was set up. Look in /proc.
Futher, the routing and netmask must be changed on most real remote
systems when a ppp link is started and when it is torn down if you
ppp-link to a server that is going to become the default route for
a LAN. This is how you get internet connectivity for more than the
machine on the ppp link.
When my ppp link is running, my machine at work routes a small
group of my home machines with a netmask of 255.255.255.128.
My machines are grouped in the lower numbers of the network so
routed.
