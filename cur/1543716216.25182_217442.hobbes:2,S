Well, in this case it's bespoke C code so adding the fadvise isn't
terribly difficult.  (The structure of the code doesn't lend itself to
"do this every 10 MB" but I'm sure I can hack something up.)
It would be nicer if the kernel would do the right thing without needing
to have its hand held, but the fadvise will solve my immediate need.
(Assuming it works on 2.4.)
