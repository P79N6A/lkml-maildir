actually even if the app reads large chunks of data RA is needed, the
size of the read/io_submit syscalls won't reach the
readpage/wait_on_page at the pagecache layer, w/o readahead we would
read PAGE_SIZE per dma and not more (ignoring PAGE_CACHE_SIZE of course,
which isn't going to be enough anyways due mem fragmentation issues)
