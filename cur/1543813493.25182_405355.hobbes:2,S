Please don't worry, we should be doing a right thing for normal files
already. This patch is just for block device file.

Yes, I agree. The changes of atime/mtime only sets I_DIRTY_SYNC, so,
usually this patch doesn't change fdatasync() at all.
Umm... however, I also can understand what akpm says.... check some databases.
	berkeley db 4.4: use fdatasync() if available
        mysql 5.0:	 use fdatasync() if available (innobase)
			 use fsync() (bdb)
	postgresql:	 use fdatasync() if available
	sqlite:		 use fsync
After all, I don't know.

Yes, and we are already doing it.
Thanks.
