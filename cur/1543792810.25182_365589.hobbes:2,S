Most of the other git-tree maintainers don't bother with any of that. 
acpi, agp, alsa, arm, ...  xfs.  The trees which have special -mm branches
are just drm, ieee1394, jfs, mips and netdev.
Where it all comes unstuck at present is if a maintainer has multiple
branches, and some of those branches contains diffs which are in other
branches.  If that happens, the diffs I generate throw huge rejects. 
But even then, if one branch is a strict superset of another, I can just
pull the superset one.
