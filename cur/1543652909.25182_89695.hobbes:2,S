This may or may not help but it seems relevant.  BK has uniq names for 
each changeset, we're fixing BK/Web so you can use the uniq names instead
of the revs (which change out from under you).  
So it should be possible to link the bug report with a changeset in Linus'
tree if you want.
It's worth pointing out that if you can see the bug in a particular version
of Linus' tree then *everyone* can see it by getting a copy of the tree
as of that cset.  BK guarentees that if you clone -r<rev> then you'll see
exactly what anyone else saw as of that cset.
