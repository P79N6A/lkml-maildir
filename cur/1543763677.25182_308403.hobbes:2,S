For the record, the above speculation is probably wrong.
More likely, the first six characters "4.5(0)" of my quoted panic
message came out some time before the panic, and represent the the
[0]-[1] entry of the table.  These six chars came out at approx.
nine minutes into the calculation, and the timer panic'd the system at
ten minutes.  I didn't look at the screen between the 9th and 10th
minute, to realize that it had finally computed one table entry.
