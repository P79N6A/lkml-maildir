Andrew,
Based on previous discussions, the above solutions can be expanded/modified to:
a) allow userspace to listen to a group of cpus instead of all. Multiple
collection daemons can distribute the load as you pointed out. Doing collection
by cpu groups rather than individual cpus reduces the aggregation burden on
userspace (and scales better with NR_CPUS)
b) do flow control on the kernel send side. This can involve buffering and sending
later (to handle bursty case) or dropping (to handle sustained load) as pointed out
by you, Jamal in other threads.
c) increase receiver's socket buffer. This can and should always be done but no
involvement needed.
With regards to taskstats changes to handle the problem and its impact on userspace
visible changes,
a) will change userspace
b) will be transparent.
c) is immaterial going forward (except perhaps as a change in Documentation)
I'm sending a patch that demonstrates how a) can be done quite simply
and a patch for b) is in progress.
If the approach suggested in patch a) is acceptable (and I'll provide the testing, stability
results once comments on it are largely over), could taskstats acceptance in 2.6.18 go ahead
and patch b) be added later (solution outline has already been provided and a prelim patch should
be out by eod)
