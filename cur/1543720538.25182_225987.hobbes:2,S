Subject: [VGA16FB] Fix bogus mem_start value

Hi Andrew:
The recent change to vga16fb's memory mapping that you partially
reverted is still broken.  In particular, it's setting fix.mem_start
to a virtual address on i386.  The value of fix.mem_start is meant
to be physical.
We could simply apply virt_to_phys to it, but somehow I doubt that
is what it's meant to do on arm.  So until we hear from someone who
knows how it works on arm, let's just revert this change.
Cheers,
