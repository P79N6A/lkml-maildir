hi,

i have preempt enabled on both machines. at the moment i don't have time to recompile my kernel, but i'm going to test 2.6.2-rc1-mm1 soon on one of my machines where i'll disable it.
i'm also going to test my systems with ttcp, because at the moment i'm transferring my backup from the server to my machine with 105.48 kB/s over the gigabit line via ftp :( but cpu is normal on both machines.
