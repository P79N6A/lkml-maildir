See attached unit test code.  its not very pretty...
These are NOT exhaustive tests, yet they are a reasonable attempt at unit
testing / exercising the feature to check for stability issues.  My stress
test was to induce core dumps in these test programs while running the IBM
chat room benchmark.  The XMM.c program was written by Rao Bharata as part
of the 2.4.17 tcore testing.  I don't remember who wrote test.c, but ptest.c
is my fault.
I know that the i386 elf core file note sections only contain the class of
register data that's restored by __switch_to.  So I suppose a kernel thread,
like the migration_thread, or ksoftirq "could" dump core and GDB could do a
bt on such a dump.  However; these note sections only contain any data that
can be accessed from a non-privileged processor modes and your mileage will
vary.
