Is path checking really a performance impact? (Most of the time, for
finding a file by filename, you need to walk the directory tree, what
else?)
If path checking is a performance impact:
Why does UNIX currently do path checking? Because of (1) checking
accessibility by means of rwx-permissions and (2) doing atime updates? The
latter can be switched off on most filesystems. If someday rwx is replaced
by ACLs, do you see the possibility that path checking is not needed
anymore? If so, I'd agree that directory inheritance might impact
performance significantly.

Hard links also mess up the idea to explicitly say "aclcontrol -R 'user
bob deny all' .", because recursive aclcontrol also reaches files which
are reachable by other directories. *pondering*

Maybe it is possible to find a speed compromise between dynamically and
statically resolved ACLs: By default, every file has a static pointer to
it's ACL, so access is fast. If the user whishes to change the ACLs of
million of files, he can issue the command. This command stores the new
ACL along with the files to be changed (use wildcards) in a filesystem
structure. A daemon completes touching every file to be changed. Before
the daemon is finished, every access is checked by the filesystem against
the pending ACL changes, and if no match is found, against the static file
ACL. After the daemon is finished, as there are no pending ACL changes,
the filesystem only checks against the static file ACL.
This way, setting ACLs is fast, checking them too, and for the case that
there are no rejections against the ACL changes (or if you ignore
rejections), it is even possible to make ACL changes of a bunch of files
atomic.
