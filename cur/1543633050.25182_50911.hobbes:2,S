well, what you need to do is make sure smp_num_cpu <= NR_CPUS,
otherwise the kernel will go ballistic on several places within
the code.
- at least in the network system there is the assumption, that
NR_CPUS is the upper limit of cpus. after initialization, everything 
uses smp_num_cpus, which is a nice thing for cpu-hotplugging :)
