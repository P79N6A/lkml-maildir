Actually, come to think of it, this code is not good for any client that
needs to fill complex data structures, whether they be fixed-size or not,
because it requires having a prepackaged structure already available.
Any client that wants to have zero-copying will want to write data
directly into the buffer instead of filling an intermediate buffer first.
And this requires being able to atomically reserve.
