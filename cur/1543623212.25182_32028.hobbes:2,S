I've been following the thread, I hope I haven't missed anything fundamental.
A better long term solution is to have ordered tags work as designed.  It's 
not broken by design is it, just implementation?
I have a standing offer from at least one engineer to make firmware changes 
to the drives if it makes Linux work better.  So a reasonable plan is: first 
know what's ideal, second ask for it.  Coupled with that, we'd need a way of 
identifying drives that don't work in the ideal way, and require a fallback.
In my opinion, the only correct behavior is a write barrier that completes
when data is on the platter, and that does this even when write-back is
enabled.  Surely this is not rocket science at the disk firmware level.  Is
this or is this not the way ordered tags were supposed to work?

The filesystem should just say 'this request is a write barrier' and the 
lower layers, whether that's scsi or bio, should do what's necessary to make
it come true.
