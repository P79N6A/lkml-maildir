Jeff,
Your patch applies to lk 2.5.70 without problems.
I found that my dual Celeron (abit mobo) has this
Intel IDE controller:
   00:07.1 IDE interface: Intel Corp. 82371AB/EB/MB PIIX4 IDE (rev 01)
so I tried a 2.5.70 kernel with this patch. Two disks
connected:
   - SCSI disk to a Tekram 390u3w controller (sym53c8xx_2
     driver). Root partition on this disk
   - a Maxtor ATA disk (D740X-6L) to the Intel IDE
     controller.
Didn't get too far. After finding the SCSI controller and
SCSI disk at boot up, this came out just before it locked up:
  ata1:PATA max UDMA/33 cmd 0x1F0 ctl 0x3F6 bmdma 0xF000 irq 14
So I disabled the IDE controllers in the BIOS and then
this came out:
  ....
  PCI: Enabling device 00:07.1 (0000->0001)
  ata1:PATA max UDMA/33 cmd 0x1F0 ctl 0x3F6 bmdma 0xF000 irq 14
  ATA: abnormal status 0xFF on port 0x1F7
  ATA: abnormal status 0xFF on port 0x1F7
and it locked up again.
