You may be able to influence this with policy-based routing and
the arp-filter code.

You certainly can bind to a specific IP and/or port when initiating
a connection.  You can use the local IP to do source-based routing.
I have not done exactly the thing described here, but I have done
similar things, certainly binding to ports & ips on both server
and initiator side of an IP connection.

I think you presume too much about what other people might consider
broken or not. :)
