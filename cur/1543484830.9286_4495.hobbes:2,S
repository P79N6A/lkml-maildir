Do you have any documentation on the ATY driver?  I'm trying to get it 
to boot in 1024x768 16bpp @70Hz mode but can't get it to change from
the default with the vesafb instructions.  fbset from the command line 
works great but that's too late.
Some problems I've noticed:
* XF86_Mach64 runs at an annoyingly lower refresh rate of 60Hz instead
  of the usual 70Hz with the ATY driver.
* Sometimes, when switching consoles, my monitor flashes up a red
  warning which basically means the signal has exceeded its specs.
* One of the consoles sometimes changes background color when I switch
  to and from it. (cute!)
Oh, it's very cool to be able to run different resolutions in
different consoles although I haven't figured out how to change it for 
all of them yet.
If there's no documentation, could you tell me how to disable the ATY
driver at boot time or through lilo?  Right now I have 2 kernels
floating around.
Thanks,
Navin.
