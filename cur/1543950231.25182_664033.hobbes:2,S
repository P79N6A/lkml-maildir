No, that's not a (malign) race - cgroup_enable_task_cg_lists() is
idempotent. In the case that you see, every thread seen in the
do_each_thread() loop will already have a non-empty cg_list field, so
it will be a no-op. So adding the additional check isn't wrong but
it's not needed.
I'll look again at the code to try to figure out where the problem is.
