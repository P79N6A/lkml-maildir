Hi Ian,
    Thank you very much.
    My doubt is,
    I have a board here where all lines to the peripherals are highly 
multiplexed and
    I had to configure these lines. Now my Wireless Ethernet Driver has 
a conflict with
    the audiocodec driver. What I mean is, if I load the WLAN driver and 
try to load the
    audiocodec driver next, the audiocodec driver is not responding.
    I traced the bug to be sharing of GPIO Lines.
    Form your mail I understand GPIO controller serves some Hardware 
designers purpose.
    But what _purpose_ is it serving a _programmer_.
Regards,
Krishna Chaitanya
