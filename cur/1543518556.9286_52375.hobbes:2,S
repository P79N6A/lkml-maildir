Hi,
I'm running a linux box with the kernel 2.0.34. I'm playing video and every
exactly
two hours it looks like there is a task that "freeze"(1) the box for 20-100
ms.
I looked at the source and try to find some 7200*HZ but can not find
something
interesting. Of course all user process are stopped (crond, inetd, ...).
Configuration is simple as a network driver (tulip), bigphysarea patch and
ide drive.
So where could it come from ? Any ideas ?
(1) not really freeze, but my process can not handle video in time.
Best wishes,
		Herve.
