I suspect that what's really wanted here is not SCHED_RR but
guaranteed rate-of-forward progress.  A dynamic-window-constrained
scheduler (that guarantees not that you'll run until you sleep, but
that in any (settable) time period you'll get the opportunity to run
for at least (a smaller settable period)) is closer to what's wanted.
