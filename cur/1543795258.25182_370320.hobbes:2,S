I'm not certain whether this is the same 'mouse problem', but I'll
report the mouse problems I've been seeing.  In the past several -mm
kernels, my touchpad has initially worked at boot, but 'tapping' has
stopped working at some point later (with no obvious kernel messages).
I've experienced this problem at least with 2.6.15-rc1-mm2 and
2.6.15-rc2-mm1, and reverting
input-attempt-to-re-synchronize-mouse-every-5-seconds.patch gives a
kernel without the touchpad problems.
Thanks,
Frank
