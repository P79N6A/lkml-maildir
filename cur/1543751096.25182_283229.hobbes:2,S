Maybe it's time to have an additional entry in MAINTAINERS then -
having fscked up lists listed in there equal to sane ones seems
completely inappropriate. Requiring broken lists to marked as 'this
list is b0rked, use it at your own leisure'. That would save users and
developers from having to deal with the side effects of these fscked
up lists.
Using your own argument, I don't care why a list is fscked, the fact
is it's fscked and I don't want to have to waste my time on it.
Cheers,
Jes
