You want to also put slab and slob in there? What about page allocator?
It is ridiculous for the sake of "being easy to inspect with debuggers".
How hard is (struct slub_page *) to type?
Here is a real benefit you get with clearly defined types for struct
page: type checking.

compound_page_head() is fine too.

So does kmalloc if you take the union of all types it might possibly
be used as.
