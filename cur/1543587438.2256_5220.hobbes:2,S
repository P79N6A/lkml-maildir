Okay regardless of the call what is it going to be or do we just random
and go oh-crap data!?!?
Since HZ!==100 of all archs that have ATA/ATAPI support, it is a mircale
that FS corruption and system death is not more rampant, except for the
fact that hardware is quick by a factor of 10+ so that 1000 does not quite
do as much harm but the associated mean of HZ changes and that is a
problem with slower hardware.
Nevermind just going nuts over the issues...
Just trying to keep the flamage down and stuff like that....
