[SNIPPED all about naive user]
If you don't intend to use a particular floppy drive for "unix style"
operation, you can "mount the device" through an installable device-
driver that does anything/everything that you want. The kernel doesn't
have to care.
Any functionality (including remembering the IDs of 'N' different
diskettes -- if you want) can be handled with such a module. The
kernel doesn't have to be changed at all. The "office application"
needs to 'know' how to handle the error codes that it gets and
put up the right prompt, but the kernel doesn't have to care.
If you intend to put such a 'prompt' in the kernel, your concept
is broken.
Cheers,
