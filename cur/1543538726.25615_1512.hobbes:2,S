No it does not run in the kernel.
Basically, what it does is this (but with many more sockets):
-----8<------
void data_available(int sig, struct siginfo* si, void* context)
{
   printf("Data is available\n");
   read(data);
}
int
main(void)
{
   int fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
   struct sigaction sa_io;
   fcntl(fh, F_SETOWN, getpid());
   fcntl(fh, F_SETSIG, 32);
   fcntl(fh, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK | O_ASYNC);
   sa_io.sa_sigaction = (void*) ioSignalHandler;
   sa_io.sa_flags = SA_SIGINFO | SA_RESTART | SA_NOMASK;
   sigemptyset(&sa_io.sa_mask);
   sigaction(32, &sa_io, NULL)
   while (true)
   {
       /* Accept connections here */
   }
   return;
}
-----8<------
But data_available is not called when the socket is closed.

No other kernel major version has been tried out (yet), since the
application is developed for the stable kernel version.
