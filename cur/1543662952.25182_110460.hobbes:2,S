You appear to not have /etc/mtab as a symlink to /proc/mounts. One of
the first things I do on fresh debian installations. The kernel should
know better than some file, especially when / is mounted ro.

My broken memory tells me that Debian is working quite fine. The code
in question should be in /etc/init.d/checkroot.sh in your system.
But my eye does not find the spot, where / is remounted with a
different type. This is strange! I've often been surprised that adding
a journal and putting ext3 support in the kernel without editing
/etc/fstab was not enough.
I should test it again to prove my eye wrong.
