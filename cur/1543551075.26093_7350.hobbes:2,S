   Where would you put it for IA32 ? I don't know any free MSR that could
   be abused for that, and acessing MSRs is insanely slow anyways.  Any
   other ideas ? 
The local APIC holds the hardware cpu number (which happens to equal
the logical cpu number in the current x86 code).  And I believe the
local APIC has a 32-bit scratch register or 2 as well... but don't
quote me on that one.
