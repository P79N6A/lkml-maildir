	Ahh, a Java programmer, that explains it.

	Thousands of threads of some kind in a program may or may not be
unreasonable. Thounsands of kernel-scheduled threads is, unless the machine
has thousands of processors.

	No, you need 128 threads.

	If your kernel-scheduled threads spend most of their time blocking, then
your program is misdesigned. You are wasting resources for no reason.

	This is only the case when you have a very bad threading architecture. For
example, if you one-to-one map Java thread with LinuxThread, you will have
this problem. The fault is not in Java, and it's not in Linux -- it's in the
broken mapping.

	Right. The solution is to have kernel threads and to manage them wisely.
Linux currently has everything you need to do this.

	Again, the fault is in the one-to-one mapping of Java threads (which are
assumed cheap) and kernel threads (which are not). If someone writes a C or
C++ application that uses way more threads than there are processors, that
someone needs to be re-educated.

	Eh?
