ACK: Given that a) both Horst and Christoph think the ioctl interface
needs cleanup but proposed cleanup interfers with existing
functionality (cmb), and b) later cleanup would change the
user-interface of eer, we should rush neither the ioctl change nor
eer into .16 until the maintainer is back afaics.
