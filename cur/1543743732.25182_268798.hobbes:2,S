I think this code is the only user of that token and I wonder how well

I assume for Windows they do that for all drives?  Even older ones?
I also wonder what happens with TCQ when you get an error?  Do you
just retry everything outstanding?

It probably should get fixed, there just doesn't seem to be much
incentive to beat on the old IDE code though :( Minor cleanups seem
worthwhile but anything intrusive I worry will break some hard-to-test
platform for someone.
That said, if libata gets PATA support merged then know this is
wonderful there.
