Nevertheless this error is real, why are you trying to hide it?
This is isn't an error we can't handle, it's still perfectly within the 
limit and except that NTP reports a somewhat larger drift than you'd like 
to see, everything works fine.

Another 30% is required for normal to crappy hardware clocks and then 
there is still enough room left.

How exactly does it effect current hardware in a way that it breaks them? 
Despite this error everything still works fine, the hardware doesn't care.

That's actually a good example, why it's irrelevant. First it's using a 
cycle based clock, thus the rounding error is irrelevant. Second in the 
common case they already use 1024 as HZ to reduce this error, so something 
similiar could be done for the HZ=1200 case and I suspect that it was 
already done and only CLOCK_TICK_RATE is just wrong. This mail 
http://consortiumlibrary.org/axp-list/archive/2002-11/0101.html
 suggest 
that this is the right thing to do.
There is _no_ reason to artificially optimize this error value, there are 
still enough other ways to improve timekeeping. The granularity error is 
there no matter what you do and as long as it's within a reasonable limit 
there is nothing that needs fixing.
