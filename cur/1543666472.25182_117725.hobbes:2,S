Hi,
I'm prob. missing something really simple but I'm having probs with the
AIC79xx driver and an adaptec 29320R adapter.
Kernel:	2.4.19
aic drvr:	aic79xx-1.1.0-source.tar.gz
drvr src:	Adaptec web site
SCSI Adapter:	Adaptec 29320R
			Drives connected to U2W, UW and narrow connectors
			connected to 32-bit PCI socket
The device presents itself as two adapters, the narrow/UW one (A) and the
U2W (B). The BIOS is set to use the B adapter to boot from. When the kernel
boots it ignores the BIOS preferences for boot order and binds scsi0 to
adapter A and scsi1 to adapter B. This is a problem as the main drives are
on the U2W adapter and the drives on the other adapter are generally
removable; net result is that I have to manually choose the boot device at
startup.
Quetions:
1. Is there anyway to make the kernel driver bind the adapters in a diff
order, .e.g: U2W as primary, UW/narrow as secondary, as in the BIOS
settings?
2. When I connect a "Maxtor Atlas 10K II U320" I get repeated debug screens
and it refuses to boot from the drive
any ideas?
Thanks,
Simon
