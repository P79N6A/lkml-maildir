Peter, Alan,
thanks, this solved the problem - 2.4.0-test13pre3 is up 'n running ;)
BTW: Is it possible to shut off these "apic error on CPU0" messages."
Now I know that my board is not well designed, so what should these
messages help me? They blow up my /var/log/messages only...
kind regards
Norbert
