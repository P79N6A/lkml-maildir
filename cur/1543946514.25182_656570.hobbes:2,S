This can be done lazily by the driver yes. The place where I've an
invalidate_pages in mprotect however can also become less permissive.
It's simpler to invalidate always and it's not guaranteed the
secondary mmu page fault is capable of refreshing the spte across a
writeprotect fault. In the future this can be changed to
mprotect_pages though, so no page fault will happen in the secondary
mmu.
