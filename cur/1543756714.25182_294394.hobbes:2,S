  The test was done without monitoring. I ran another one with
monitoring and the result is:
	real    8m12.747s
	user    7m30.761s
        sys     0.51.414s
  As I only tested each case only once, I'm going to run the same test
five times to have a more accurate results.
  Thank you very much for your comments, I'm carefully looking all of
them. I will send comments next week.
Regards,
Guillaume
