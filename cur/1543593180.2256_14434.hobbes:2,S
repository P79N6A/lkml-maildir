Also think about kernel panics - the only thing that works after that
is the power or (if you have it connected) reset button.  ctrl-alt-del
needs keventd to work, and since sysrq-b is disabled by default...
However, IMHO that is a non-point because you need to be physically
at the system either way to solve the problem.
