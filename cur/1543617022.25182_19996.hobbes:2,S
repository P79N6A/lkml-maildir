those comparison are totally flawed. There's nothing to compare in
there. 
minill misses the O(1) scheduler, and -aa has faster vm etc... there's
absolutely nothing to compare in the above numbers, all variables
changes at the same time.
I'm amazed I've to say this, but in short:
1) to compare minill with preempt, apply both patches to 18-pre3, as the
   only patch applied (no O(1) in the way of preempt!!!!)
2) to compare -aa with preempt, apply -preempt on top of -aa and see
   what difference it makes
If you don't follow exactly those simple rules you will change an huge
amount of variables at the same time, and it will be again impossible to
make any comparison or deduction from the numbers.
