OK. But it does makes the init function much longer and harder to read.

Sure, when zero is special, like for booleans or integer or pointers.
But this is a status byte value, I don't want to mistreat it just
because all its bits are unset. Otherwise, imagine the non-systematic
mess this will become:
	if (data.val[0x1]!=0x00 ||
	    data.val[0x2]!=0x60 ||
	    data.val[0x3]!=0x00 ||
	    data.val[0xF]!=0x00)
		ABORT_INIT("check2");
