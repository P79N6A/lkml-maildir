In the Xen case, we actually need to use io_remap_page_range for
all /dev/mem accesses, so as to be able to map the BIOS area, DMI
tables etc.
Are people generally happy with the introduction of
ARCH_HAS_DEV_MEM as a way of migrating away from the nest of
#ifdef's in mem.c ?
I wasn't sure how best to handle the fact that /dev/kmem shared
its mmap implementation with /dev/mem.  BTW: Does anyone know of
any programs that make use of mmap'ing /dev/kmem?
Thanks,
Ian
