In the ATA spec, the CHECK POWER MODE command (E5h) specifically
states that it shouldn't alter the power mode of the device.
Therefore, there should be no harm in checking the power mode of a
device in STANDBY or IDLE state, and it shouldn't cause the device to
spin up.  Checking a drive on my bench I confirmed this behavior.
With Serial ATA you have to consider the SATA bus PM states as well,
but that's a different topic of discussion.
