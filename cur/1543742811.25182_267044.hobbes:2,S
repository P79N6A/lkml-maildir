As soon as you are Halle Berry, that's true.  Until then, that's not true.
Come on Pavel, you think I'm stupid enough to tell you that you can touch
BK?  No, I'm not.  No, you can't.  Under any circumstances.  You've long
since lost that priviledge and you aren't getting it back.
You've got the BK2CVS tree, I suggest you use it.  That's all you get and
no amount of dancing around with my words will change that.
Are we clear on all this?
