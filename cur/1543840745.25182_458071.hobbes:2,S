What AGI stall?

No.  It can only merge statements it knows anything about, and it doesn't
about inline assembly.

It seems to make some difference if it's able to move asm around
and if they don't have memory clobbers. memory clobbers really seem
to cause much worse code in the whole function.
But current_thread_info didn't have that.
