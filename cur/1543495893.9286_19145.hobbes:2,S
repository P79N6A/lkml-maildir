OK, I'm assuming that if you're reading this, you read my message on
memcpy by 8 bytes. Why not also implement memcmp and memset using MMX
instructions to work by 8 bytes each? It would work just like the mempcy
idea, just with a different instruction inside the loop (PCMPEQD for
example, could be used for memcmp)
