	Erm... AFACS NTFS offloads only part of stuff out of inode. Why,
BTW?
	IMHO we need some mechanism that would allow using slabs from
modules. Then generic mechanisms would work quite fine. Maybe we would be
fine with request_slab(int size) that would keep a family of slabs, look
for one with the right object size in said family and create a new one if
not found. But then, I'm not a VM hacker (hint, hint).

	Ahem... how will you deal with priorities?
