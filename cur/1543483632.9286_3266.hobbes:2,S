RSS is kind of hard to measure accurately anyway since chunks are shared with 
the disk cache and other apps.
In Linux we'd do something like
T=0
>data
while { true }
do
	ps ux $PID | ( read HEADER; read A B C D E F G ; echo $T" "$F >>data)
	sleep 1 
	T=`expr $T + 1`
done
The wonders of a tool based system ;)
And maybe gnuplot the result
