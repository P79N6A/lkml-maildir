Eric,
Hmmm... I'm having a lot more problems on my troublesome machine with
this patchset than I did with the previous iteration.  I've
triple-checked the application of the patches, but I can't even get
kexec_test to start, much less run to completion.
The new behavior is that the system appears to hang immediately after
invoking "kexec kexec_test".
What could I have done wrong?
Thanks,
Andy
