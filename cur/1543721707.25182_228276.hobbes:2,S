Well, here's a new patch, I'm confident you'll like it even less. My
fixes so far will trigger iput on inode B during the clear_inode call of
inode A.  Even if this is legal today, it seems doomed to cause bugs
later on.
Another option is to inc the reference count of the block device inode
during background write out.  But, since we're racing with the block
device clear_inode call here, that will need to involve the bdev
spinlock somewhere along the way, and has lock ordering issues since the
block device code already takes inode_lock under bdev_lock.

__bd_forget will change the mapping for an inode without waiting to make
sure no users of the inode are using that mapping.  In the case of
background writeout, it is possible for __bd_forget to free the
block device inode while mpage_writepages is still looking through the
mapping for dirty pages.
