As far as I can tell, no driver in 2.4 supports NAPI (aka polling support)
with the exception of the tg3 driver -- but that's a GigE card.
The Adapter DuraLAN/Starfire driver (which I maintain) has been modified to
support NAPI, but those changes have not yet been included in the official
kernel. I can mail you the patch, if you want to give it a try. The cards
are on the expensive side, but not overly so (about $100/port).
