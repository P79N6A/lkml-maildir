What do back-to-school fashion and instant messaging have to do with one
another?
Not much, but as kids across the States flock back to the classroom
decked out in new fall duds (and what's with this whole "vest" thing,
anyway--will cummerbunds be next?), so returns the big kid on the IM
block sporting a host of new features.
Introducing a new ICQ:
http://www.download.com/DD/dl/0,302,0-0817-1-002,00.html
Now, this is no double-decimal-point update; version 99b beta packs in a
couple new features and other smart improvements that stand to give ICQ a
permanent seat at the head of the instant messaging class.
And one more thing: don't miss all the back-to-school resources in this
week's dispatch. We promise: no vests.

6. Gamecenter's GamerX goes multiplayer after school!
Multiplayer games have sure changed throughout the years and the changes
have definitely been for the better. For most gamers, "the good old days"
meant coming home from school, sitting in front of the Atari 2600, and
playing a challenging game of tank battle with the next door neighbor.
Now we have the option of playing 3D shooters with our battle-buddies in
Japan. To celebrate not doing homework, GamerX has put together a list of
multiplayer favorites stretching from Doom to online Tetris clones. So
put your books down and get ready for battle!
