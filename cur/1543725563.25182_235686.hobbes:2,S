Well just remember, on 20040704 you send me a 'huge patch' which should also 
fix our module unload problems.

Unfortunality I began to capture via serial console only a few hour after the 
server crashed. As there is also nothing in the logs, I don't have the 
beginning trace of the problems.
Since there is something about sk98 in almost all traces, I thought it might 
be a sk98lin problem.
Anyway, do you have an idea what might have cause this memory allocation 
problem?
Thanks,
	Bernd
