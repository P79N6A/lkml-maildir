Hi Dawson, your tool looks nice. I don't think the output is too
cryptic.
However, I think these deadlocks may be incorrect because
lock_kernel is not a normal lock. It gets dropped when the
thread blocks, so I *think* it is basically invisible to any
sort of blocking lock when it comes to deadlock cycles.
So if your threads interleave like this:
1			2
lock_kernel();
			down(semaphore);
			lock_kernel();
down(semaphore);
Then thread 2 will spin on the lock_kernel lock (bkl) until
thread 1 hits down(semaphore) and goes to sleep, releasing
the bkl. Thread 2 takes the bkl and proceeds.
I think?
