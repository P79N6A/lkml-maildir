John Hall, the author of /Programming Linux Games/, and someone who I consider 
a friend, was diagnosed with Stage IV Melanoma, which is very life 
threatening. He's asking the public to help donate to the American Cancer 
Society ( 
http://www.acsevents.org/faf/r.asp?t=4&i=99915&u=99915-86454580
 ), 
he's trying to raise $1,000 for melanoma research. All money donated goes 
straight to the American Cancer Society.
