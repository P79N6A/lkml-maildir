Network card: Addtron AEF-360TX (RealTek 8139) Fast Ethernet 10/100
Computer: Alpha 533Mhz
OS: Redhat 6.2 (kernel 2.2.14-6)
The ip was initially set to 10.0.0.24 and got no where with pinging. So
decided to change ip to 10.0.0.200 and ran a one ping test against a known
good local computer at 10.0.0.6.
Ran "ping -c 1 10.0.0.6" from 10.0.0.200.
Resutls:
#1 eth0: Oversized Ethernet frame, status 27f008
   eth0: Oversized Ethernet frame, status 27f78c
#2 success
#3 no error message. 100% loss
#4 no error message. 100% loss
#5 no error message. 100% loss
