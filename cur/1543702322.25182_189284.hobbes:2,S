Hi Ben,
the situation is like this (exactly this works flawlessly with tulip):
- unplug all interfaces from the switches
- reboot box
- plug in _one_ interface 
- log into the box (yes, network works flawlessly)
- start keepalived
- now plug in rest of the interfaces
- watch keepalived do _nothing_ (seems no UP event shows up)
in comparison to:
- let all interfaces plugged in
- reboot box
- log in
- start keepalived
- watch it work as expected
Regards,
Stephan
