I'm not sure it was really a thinko.  Pat Mochel was well aware of the 
problem and just decided not to do anything about it.

It's possible to make the locking internal to normal lists as well, if 
anyone wanted to do it.

There's a big difference.  Originally the driver model used a _single_
rwsem that covered everything in a subsystem: all the devices, all the
drivers, and all the lists.  What I'm suggesting is using lots of rwsems
or mutexes, one for each list.  (The driver core has already added a
semaphore for each device.)  Being much finer-grained, it would not lead
to deadlock.

Actually, in their original form klists could indeed be used in interrupt
contexts, since they involved only spinlocks.  That's not quite true any 
more.
And certainly replacing them with rwsem-protected lists won't make them 
any more interrupt-friendly.  On the other hand, as far as I know nobody 
wants to use them in interrupt contexts.
