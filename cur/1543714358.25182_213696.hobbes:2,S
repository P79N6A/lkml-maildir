I was referring to the paper by Jeffrey Scott Vitter "Design and Analysis of 
Dynamic Huffman Codes" (accessible through 
http://acm.org
). It defines a 
refinement of the well-known dynamic Huffman algorithm by Faller, Gallager 
and Knuth such that the encoded length will use at most _one_ more bit per 
encoded letter than the optimal two-pass Huffman algorithm (it is also shown 
that the FGK algorithm an use twice the optimal length + on more bit per 
letter).
My conclusion comes from the fact that for every text, the optimal two-pass 
huffman encoding can _not_ be longer than the native encoding (apart from the 
dictionnary encoding). 
Actually I plan to implement the easier FGK algorithm first - if the whole 
matter makes sense.
