$ cat /proc/asound/cards
 0 [AudioPCI       ]: ENS1371 - Ensoniq AudioPCI
                      Ensoniq AudioPCI ENS1371 at 0xec00, irq 18
 1 [Fastlane       ]: USB-Audio - Fastlane
                      MOTU Fastlane at usb-0000:00:10.2-1, full speed
$ amidi -l
IO  hw:0,0    ES1371
IO  hw:1,0,0  Fastlane MIDI A
IO  hw:1,0,1  Fastlane MIDI B
$ amidi -d -p hw:1,0,0
At this point I should see two-digit hex numbers in groups of five or six
whenever a key or other control on the midi keyboard is operated.
Nothing happens though.  Oddly enough, nothing happens when I try midi
through the soundcard as well.  Checking further, I've never been able to
get midi to work with kernels 2.6.18 and later.
