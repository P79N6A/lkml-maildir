Hi All,
	I was installing a sound card in a HP Vectra and noticed that if
the parport, which I built in, driver detected the parallel port on IRQ
7, but in DMA mode that it would not show up in /proc/interrupts, only in
dmesg, but if I tried to use that IRQ for the sound card it would fail.
Now, the sound card is installed, but why didn't parport's findings show up
in /proc/interrupts? I think that it should.
snippets of boot sequence: 
Starting kswapd v 1.5
parport0: PC-style at 0x378 [SPP,ECP,ECPPS2]
parport0: detected irq 7; use procfs to enable interrupt-driven operation.
Detected PS/2 Mouse Port.
Snippets of the sb driver when I tried to install on IRQ 7:
SB 3.1 detected OK (220)
sb: Interrupt test on IRQ7 failed - Probable IRQ conflict
<ESS ES1688 AudioDrive (rev 11) (3.1)> at 0x220 irq 7 dma 1
Now, upon playing an au file: 
Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?
Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?
	This was noting terrible for me to figure out, but it would've
made it a hell of a lot safer if it was in /proc/interrupts.
	Thanks,
	Robbie Stone
