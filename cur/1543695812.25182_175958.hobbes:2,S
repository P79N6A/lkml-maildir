Yes it will show improvement, and I would like to hear how much given how 
simple it is, but I agree with you. There is an intrinsic difference in the 
vm in 2.6 that makes it too hard for multiple running applications to have a 
small piece of the action instead of giving out big pieces of the action. 
While it is better in most circumstances I believe you describe well the 
problem under vm overload. I guess encoding a vm scheduler will help (and 
clearly 2.8 territory) but at what overhead cost? I have no idea myself, as 
now I'm pulling catch-phrases out of my arse that I hate hearing others use 
(see any lkml thread about scheduling from people who don't code).
Cheers,
Con
