Please consider updating to the following patch:
Description: Use ssleep() instead of schedule_timeout() to guarantee the task
delays as expected. The existing code should not really need to run in
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, as there is no check for signals (or even an early return
value whatsoever). ssleep() takes care of these issues.
