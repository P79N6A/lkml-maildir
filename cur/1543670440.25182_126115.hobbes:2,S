Wrong, because we have to call strlen _anyway_, to provide the size to 
kmalloc.

That's kinda cute.  Why not submit a patch to the strcpy implementation 
in include/asm-i386/string.h?  :)  Ours is shorter, but does have a jump:
         "1:\tlodsb\n\t"
         "stosb\n\t"
         "testb %%al,%%al\n\t"
         "jne 1b"
Which is better?  I don't know; I'm still learning the performance 
eccentricities of x86 insns on various processors.
Related x86 question:  if the memory buffer is not dword-aligned, is 
'rep movsl' the best idea?  On RISC it's usually smarter to unroll the 
head of the loop to avoid unaligned accesses; but from reading x86 asm 
code in the kernel, nobody seems to care about that.  Is the 
unaligned-access penalty so small that the increased code size of the 
head-unroll is never worth it?

In fact, that's basically the kernel's non-arch-specific implementation :)
