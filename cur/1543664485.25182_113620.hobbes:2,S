Subject: [via-rhine][PATCH] 1.17 release
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Alas no rave reviews on lkml, but the private feedback I have received so
far on the recent changes has been excellent. The Rhine-II is now finally
usable with via-rhine. Time to call it 1.17. -- Please apply.
FWIW I think the four patches (including this one) leading up to 1.17 are
2.4 material, too. The drivers were identical at 1.16, and some kind souls
successfully tested 1.17 on 2.4. Given the low frequency of 2.4 releases
and the brokenness of the driver until now, it would seem like a good idea
to have it in 2.4.21.
