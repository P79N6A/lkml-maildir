  I don't pretend that kernel interfaces stay written in stone, for 
ages. What I would like is that, at least, those interfaces were stable 
enough, let's say for a few months for a stable kernel series, so I 
don't have to keep bothering my propietary VMWare vendor to fix the 
problems for me, since the new kernel interface broke VMWare. Yeah, I 
know I could decide not to upgrade kernels in last instance, but that's 
not always possible.
If kernel interfaces need to be changed for whatever reason, change 
them in 2.7, -mm, -ac or whatever tree first, and let the community 
know beforehand what those changes will be, and be prepared to adapt. 
Meanwhile, try to leave 2.6 as stable as possible.
