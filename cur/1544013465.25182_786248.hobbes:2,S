Which are a trivial wrapper around wait queues.  I have patches to kill

Which are needed so we can have asserts about the lock state, which
generic rwsems still don't have.  At some pointer Peter looked into
it, and once we have that we can kill the wrapper.
and wrappers around kmalloc and kmem_cache.

From painfull experience with a lot of things, including a filesystem
you keep on mentioning it's clear that once stuff is upstream there
is very little to no incentive to fix these things up.
