Maybe you do not have to dynamically allocate memory? You
can allocate kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL) during initialization
and only free it when you remove a module. That way, it's
always there. Such RAM is still okay for interrupts because
kernel RAM is never swapped out. You only need GFP_ATOMIC for
stuff allocated and freed when the interrupts are off like
in ISRs.
