Please ship that to me and I'll stick it in.
I like Garbriels bootloader and I think it may be worthwhile to make the
MBX/PReP bootloader break sometime soon.  A relocatable bootloader for
prep would solve a lot of problems.
}I'll try upgrading to 2.2.0p7 tonight and see how that works.

}I haven't been able to get the PS/2 mouse working yet.  Also, I'll try to stitch
}in the code I had in the 2.0.XX kernels to handle/fake residual data on the PreP
}boxes - so I can have my 64M RAM back :-)
