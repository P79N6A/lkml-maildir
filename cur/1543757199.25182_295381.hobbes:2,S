What do we do for previous GCC, which probably do not define _gcov_init (at 
least I guess, since things worked before)? We'll get a "unresolved symbol" 
in the kernel linking, I guess (unverified).
It is possible, even if ugly, to $(NM) the relevant libraries to choose what 
to do, by adding a -D__EXPORT_GCOV_INIT_ (or even, if we know well, to 
indicate the GCC version needed for this).
So, for now, I guess we must defer this to later than 2.6.11...
