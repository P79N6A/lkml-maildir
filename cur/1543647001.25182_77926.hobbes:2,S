    Hi Marc :))
    I almost forgot... A process become a zombie if it dies before
its parent, so the parent can retrieve child process status using
'wait()'. If the parent dies before doing this *then* the process
will be inherited by 'init' and ripped at some time.
    Seems like your gpg has died leaving a lot of children and 'init'
hasn't done its harvest yet ;))) Give it some time.
