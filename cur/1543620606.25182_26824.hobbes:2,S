Sorry, the cat ate my last patch. This one seems to actually apply
cleanly.
This patch fixes an SGML error in the last <chapter> tag of the
deviceiobook.tmpl. Problem is that include/asm-i386/io.h doesnt provide
documentation, so trying to include said nonexistant documentation
causes the whole process to fail.
This patch slightly modifies a patch submitted by David Gomez last
October.
