Hi,
I want to implement something of a traffic smoother that instead of sending packets in a burst would send them at some particular rate and hence smooth it out.  I've heard that this can be incorporated in the kernel in the IP layer, but for that i need to know as to what function is used to send the packets from the IP layer and in which file can I find that ?? Any help please ??? I'm using Linux Redhat 6.1.
Thanks,
Sincerely,
aamir
