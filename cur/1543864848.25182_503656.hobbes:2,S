First of all, thank you for your answer.

Unfortunately, I can't easily do stuff on the NAS box other than what it was 
provided for. (An interesting project exists about the first version of the 
Maxtor Shared Storage : openmss, but this one is based on a totally different 
hardware).

The network device I use is :
"D-Link System Inc DGE-528T Gigabit Ethernet Adapter (rev 10)",
and the driver used is the one for "Realtek 8169 PCI Gigabit Ethernet adapter" 
(in the 2.6.19.2) which is the only one that recognizes this device.
That problem also remind me that when I compiled this driver without 
the "CONFIG_NET_ETHERNET" (in the section "Ethernet (10 or 100Mbit)"), I have 
really poor performance with the net device. Maybe it is related, or not ;)
If it gives you more ideas ?
Maybe it could be interesting to know about the r8169 maintainer, but I dont 
know who he is.

Could you give me some worthful URLs ?
Thank you again.
