Just curious. Do you know whether this strengthens security at all?  I
would guess that the security can not be better than if we used
RIPE-MD320 to hash the passphrase, and that hash is considered to have
the same security as RIPE-MD160.

Looks sane.  Merged it and updated the util-linux patch to 2.10o.
