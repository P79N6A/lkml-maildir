That may not be as simple as it seems. To properly account system v user 
time using the sched_clock we'd have to hook into arch dependant asm code to 
know when entering and exiting kernel context. That is far more invasive 
than the simple on/off runqueue timing we currently do for scheduling 
accounting.
