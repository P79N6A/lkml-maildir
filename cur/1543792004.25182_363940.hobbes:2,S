OK, I put the NULL check in with my previous patch.
And you are absolutely right in the de_thread() case.  I need to add 
more cases to steamroller...

This patch was not mine, though I guess that it is by now.  ;-)

But in that case, __exit_sighand(->group_leader) would have been called,
so ->sighand would be NULL.  And none of this can change while we are holding
tasklist_lock.
If we don't want to be hitting the exec()ed task with a signal, the
thing to do would be to drop the signal, as in the attached patch.
I believe that this is an acceptable approach, since had the timer
fired slightly later, it would have been disabled, right?
Thoughts?
						Thanx, Paul
