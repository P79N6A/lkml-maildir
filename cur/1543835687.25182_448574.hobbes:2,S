Yeah... but how do you prove it?  The top machine on 
http://counter.li.org/
http://counter.li.org/reports/uptimestats.php
is just above mine - but running a kernel that wasn't even released that 
amount of days ago?
Anyway, on cue (would you believe THIS?!?), about 10 minutes after I replied 
to this thread, I received a mail:

Dear Mr Warne,
Thank you for sending us the details of your recent record proposal for 'home 
computer - longest 'uptime''. We are afraid to say that we are unable to 
accept this as a Guinness World Record.
We have considered your proposal carefully but regret that it is not something 
for which we are currently interested in listing a record. We receive over 
60,000 enquiries a year from which only a small proportion are approved by 
our experienced researchers to establish new categories.
We realize that this will be disappointing to you. However, we have considered 
your proposal fully; in the context of the specific subject area and that of 
records as a whole, and our decision is final in this matter.
Once again thank you for your interest in Guinness World Records.
Yours sincerely,
Amarilis Espinoza
Records Management Team
Heh.  BUGGER!
Nick
