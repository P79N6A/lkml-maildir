Hello,
I need to develop a configuration utility to a network device. All I need
this application to do (I guess) is to open this netdev, send an IOCTL to
it, and then close it. At least that's how I'm used to do it with serial
ports ... :)
The info I need is: is there any good resource of information on how to
write such an application ?? I tried looking at the ifconfig (net-tools)
code, but that's too (read much more) complex for what I need.
If anybody could help me, I'd really appreciate it.
Regards,
Ivan
