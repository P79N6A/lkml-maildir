Subject: Some section mismatch in acpi_processor_power_init on ia64 build

I've only just noticed these warnings when building ia64 !SMP or
!HOTPLUG_CPU
kernels:
WARNING: drivers/acpi/processor.o - Section mismatch: reference to
.init.data: from .text between 'acpi_processor_power_init' (at offset
0x5040) and 'acpi_processor_power_exit'
WARNING: drivers/acpi/processor.o - Section mismatch: reference to
.init.data: from .text between 'acpi_processor_power_init' (at offset
0x5050) and 'acpi_processor_power_exit'
According to git bisect, they began with Matt Domsch's "ia64: use i386
dmi_scan.c"
patch (commit 3ed3bce8), but it appears that the real issue may be
further back when
Ashok Raj marked processor_power_dmi_table as __cpuinitdata in 7ded5689
with a
cryptic comment by AK (Andi Kleen?):
  /* Actually this shouldn't be __cpuinitdata, would be better to fix
the
     callers to only run once -AK */
