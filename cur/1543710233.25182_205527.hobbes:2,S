FWIW, these four errors:
Error 4 occurred at disk power-on lifetime: 6619 hours
  When the command that caused the error occurred, the device was in an
unknown state.
  After command completion occurred, registers were:
  ER ST SC SN CL CH DH
  -- -- -- -- -- -- --
  84 51 00 00 00 00 e0  Error: ICRC, ABRT
  Commands leading to the command that caused the error were:
  CR FR SC SN CL CH DH DC   Timestamp  Command/Feature_Name
  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   ---------  --------------------
  c8 ff 01 00 00 00 e0 08     546.992  READ DMA
  ef 03 45 20 77 a5 e0 08     546.992  SET FEATURES [Set transfer mode]
  c6 ff 10 20 77 a5 e0 08     546.992  SET MULTIPLE MODE
  10 ff 50 20 77 a5 e0 08     546.992  RECALIBRATE [OBS-4]
  91 03 3f 20 77 a5 ef 08     546.992  INITIALIZE DEVICE PARAMETERS  [OBS-6]
are all 'conventional' DMA errors, in which there was a CRC error in the
hardware interface between the disk and the controller.  Either the cable
connections to this disk were briefly problematic or their was electrical
noise on the lines.  Probably not anything to worry about.

FWIW, there have been reports of problems (system lockup) with
smartmontools on systems with Promise 20262 and 20265 controllers. See:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/smartmontools/sm5/WARNINGS?sortby=date&view=markup
So I guess I will need to add the 20268 controller to this list, although
as Mario says, smartmontools may play only an indirect role, in exposing
an existing problem.
Cheers,
