Lately, I've been noticing the mouse cursor ever so slightly moving
around as I type.  I was beginning to wonder about my beer intake when I
discovered that I can hold a modifier like shift or control and watch
the mouse cursor dance around the screen.  Doesn't happen all the time
but often enough that if you have a similar problem you won't have any
trouble reproducing.
It looks as though there's an entity in the input subsystem that
normally ignores spurious noise from the mouse.  This "noise
suppression" seems to be disabled when handling key presses.
Some details.  The mouse is a basic logitech wheel mouse connected via
usb to a dell i8k laptop.  To rule out the touchpad/keyboard clitorus, I
can disconnect the mouse and the problem stops.
So has anybody else seen anything like this or should I be seeking
therapy?
