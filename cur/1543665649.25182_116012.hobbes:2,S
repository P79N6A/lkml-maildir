   the spinlock isnt new.  the atm code has always had a global spinlock.
   i submitted a patch a couple weeks ago to convert the spinlock to a
   semaphore (so things would atleast work for now while i decide how to fix
   it the right way).  so my confusion is 'new spinlock'.  what new spinlock?
   did i miss something?
The important bit is that the patches you sent me didn't
apply, the rejects were in the sections that had references
to the older style atm device locking.
Whether the older style was one thing or another is irelevant.
The main point is that you need to send me clean patches
that actually apply to current 2.5.x trees :-)
