That mean a problem with rsync, though.
BTW: I think the bandwidth increase compared to bkcvs isn't that obvious.
After a file is modified with git, it has to be transmitted (plus
small additional things.
If a file is modified with bkcvs, it has to be transmitted (the whole
RCS file) as well.
Only the initial rsync would be much smaller with bkcvs.
