Folks
I am running into a curious problem on linux 2.4.20 kernel. 
The problem :
  Every 25 minutes the sytem usage as indicated by "top -i -d 1" 
  goes up from 0 to about 50% and stays at this level for around 
  100 seconds and than comes down to zero or near zero again. 
  The user cpu % stays at 0. And the CPU used by all the active 
  process put togather stays below 5%
  The system is idle when this happens in so far as I can tell. 
  The only tasks which show up in the top are :
    -- "X" and [ CPU usage ~ 5%]
    -- top itself [ CPU usage ~ 0%]
  The hardware configuration is as follows:
    P4 2.4Ghz 512M Ram, 128M IDE compatible Flash Drive, 
    there is a 50 Meg CramFs parition on flash and 200 M
    ext3 partition.
Could this be a kernel configuration issue.
Any help would be greatly appreciate.
thanks
Arun Punj
