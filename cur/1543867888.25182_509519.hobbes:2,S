Yes they can, since you have (most likely) breached the contract! To fix 
a bug in Windows you will have to de-assemble their code (if you are not 
on their pay-role, of course) and that is explicitly forbidden. You are 
in no way allowed to read how Windows does things.
Or you may just have made random changes and it happens to work, I still 
don't think they would like it (what other thing may happened by that 
patch?)
