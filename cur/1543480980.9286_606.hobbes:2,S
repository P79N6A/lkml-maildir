Folks,
I was most disturbed to see Draft 6 of the Press Release on Slashdot.org
this afternoon.
First, who are we to presume such actions upon ourselves? It's up to Linus
to decide what constitutes a good press release.
Second, had this happened at a major corporation the person responsible
would have been fired.
It's a draft release for a very *good* reason, which means it's not ready
for the whole world to see.
Now I'll sit back and see the FUD fly, and sure they will. 
Cheers,
Alex.
