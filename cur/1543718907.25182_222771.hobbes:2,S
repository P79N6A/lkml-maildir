Hmm.. I'm missing something here.
It's unclear (at least to me) whether your issue is:
a) You're submitting patches that consist of GPL'able code that you don't have
the company-internal paperwork in place to authorize the release; or
b) The patches you're releasing aren't GPL'able because they're in some way
encumbered by a licensing issue.
In either case, we need to clarify and fix the problem, totally separate from
the DCO issue (all *that* does is that if somebody points out a problem with a
patch of yours down the road, we know to ask *you* about it....)
