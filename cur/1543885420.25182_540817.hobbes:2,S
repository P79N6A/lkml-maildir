If you need to treat the block in a contiguous range, then you need to
vmap() the discontiguous pages. That has substantial overhead if you
have to do it regularly.
We do this in xfs_buf.c for > page size blocks - the overhead that
caused when operating on inode clusters resulted in us doing some
pointer fiddling and directly addresing the contents of each page
to avoid the vmap overhead. See xfs_buf_offset() and friends....

I think you might need to modify the copy-in and copy-out operations
substantially (e.g. prepare_/commit_write()) as they assume a buffer doesn't
span multple pages.....
Cheers,
Dave.
