Quoting that...
	|len -> r6 + second halve on stack
Then, is not this a gcc glitch? (IMO, it should put all of "len" on the 
stack)

Does it actually matter? Glibc can have its own argument ordering
different from the syscalls, so at least it would be possible to lay out
the syscall arguments in the most portable way while retaining nice
userspace C code. Hey, glibc might even wrap it up in a struct! (Using a 
pointer, as suggested in one of the proposals.)
int fallocate(int fd, loff_t offset, loff_t len, int mode)
{
	struct fallocate_foobar d = {fd, offset, len, mode};
	return _syscall(..., &d);
}
