Yes, it added by the kernel, I know the new 2.2 scheme, when all
devices created with routing to them.
In 2.0 this route is added by pppd. You want to say that
kernel added routes is just inavctive? It is plain silly then.
Once I did 'ifconfig dummy0 62.244.13.1' and lose
all communications with 62.0.0.0/8 immediately, just because kernel added
route:
62.0.0.0	0.0.0.0	255.0.0.0	UH	X X X dummy0
What is the difference between dummy and ppp interfaces in this case?
Bye,
