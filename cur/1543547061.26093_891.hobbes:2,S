After compliation with the Promise UDMA chipsets support, with Use DMA
by Default checked, the kernel refuses to acknowledge the existence of
the chip.  I have an ASUS K7M m/b that has the controller built in to
the motherboard.   After using dmesg I saw no attempts at all to use the
kernel driver at all, no error message, etc.  Any ideas?
