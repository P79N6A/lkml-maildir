even if the workload is fully CPU bound externally - internally a 
request to the external (CPU-bound) thread will look like an asynchonous 
request - so small amounts of idle time can be within UML, legitimately. 
(for the amount of time it takes for the external thread to service the 
request)
30 msecs already sounds a bit excessive (this is on your T60 with 
Core2Duo, right?), and 1-2 seconds noticeable latency is definitely 
excessive.
