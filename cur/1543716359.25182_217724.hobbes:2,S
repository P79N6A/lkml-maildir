hi
 i am doing a project on
 a very simple system call interception module.
 the module is supposed to return the  uid of the 
 user who made the call to the syscall. i m trying to 
 do it thus:
//in the kernel module
asmlinkage long my_syscall(arg1,arg2)
{
	sprintf(buffer, "%s%s%i", arg1,arg2,current->uid);
	//this buffer is later read.
        return original_syscall(arg1,arg2);
}
the problem is that the uid returned is always -1.
i found you had a similar problem very long back
 and had posted a msg on a mailing list.
could you suggest a way out please.
thanx
