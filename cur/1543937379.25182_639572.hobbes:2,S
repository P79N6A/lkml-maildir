Ah. Hmm. *pokes about* That does seem to correspond pretty closely to
what happens with the echo 3 >/proc/.... Though it never seems to get to
0 (~4 meg is as close as it gets on this box) which seems to jive with
what Peter said in the other email.
Hmm. I think tomorrow I'll be writing free.pl and modifying my graphing
and monitoring stuff to take this into account somehow. :)
Thanks!
