No, you do it right;-) The instructions seem to be a leftover from the
time when Linus named the kernel directory linux/ (as opposed to
linux-2.5.xx).

However, your patch gets us only half-way to correct instructions,
since for 'patch -p1' one also needs to cd into the kernel directory.
E.g., something like
     install by patching, get all the newer patch files, enter the
     top level directory of the kernel source (the one named
     linux-2.xx.yy) and execute:
               gzip -cd ../patchXX.gz | patch -p1
     or
               bzip2 -dc ../patchXX.bz2 | patch -p1
     (repeat xx for all versions bigger than the version of your current
     source tree, _in_order_) and you should be ok. Don't forget to rename
     the kernel directory to linux-2.xx.zz where zz is the number of the
     lates patch you applied.
may be better?
