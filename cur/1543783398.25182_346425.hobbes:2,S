I think marking it as present, and considering in cpu_possible_map is perfectly
ok. But we would need more glue logic, that is if firmware marked it as 
disabled, then one would expect you then run _STA and find that the CPU
is now present and functional as reported by _STA, then the CPU is onlinable.
So if _STA can work favorably in your case you can use it to override the 
disabled setting at boot time which would be prefectly fine.
