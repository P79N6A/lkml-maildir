With current -git, I still get the same behavior as with 
previous 2.6.23-rcX kernels - i.e. after resume (with 
acpi_sleep=s3_bios,s3_mode), I get corrupted image resembling the BIOS 
POST graphics.
Previous kernels (I am currently pretty sure that 
15028aad00ddf241581fbe74a02ec89cbb28d35d was OK, but I haven't done the 
bisection yet) resumed perfectly with acpi_sleep=s3_bios,s3_mode on this 
machine.
Please note that this is very different HW than you have - it is sort-of a 
desktop machine, not a notebook at all.
