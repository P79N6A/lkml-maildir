Ok, so that is two things that need to be in the manpage and probably in
bold:
	1) epoll only works on pipes and sockets
              (not on tty, not on files)
        2) epoll must be used on non-blocking sockets only
              (and describe the race that happens otherwise)
If you send me the source of your manpages I'll work it in if you want.
I still vote for checking at insert time however unless that is too
expensive. Yes, we want people to read the manpages and heed them, but we
also not want to create interfaces that are needlessly errorprone.
Regards,
bert
