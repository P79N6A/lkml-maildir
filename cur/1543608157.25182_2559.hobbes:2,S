All,
I am a new comer to the Linux world. It is really a hard start for me when I dig into those OS code although I have a strong theoretic background in OS and computer architecture. I am now being blocking at the start_kernel and caliberate_delay function of Kernel 2.2.x. Also, everyday, I got hundreds of mail from Linux-kernel list but I cannot enjoy it.
So could some experienced guys give some advice on how to start, which document/material can be recommended on this.
My keen interest in this filed make me free to any suggestions on that. Please lend your hands
Best Regards,
Noah Yan
