So I haven't looked at this a lot, but it strikes me that it look to be 
much simple if you were to just increment the page count instead of 
playing games in mm/page_alloc.c.
That will make sure that it never goes back on any free lists, and 
requires no changes to the allocator. Hmm?
I'm also not really seeing why this triggers on lru_cache_add(), since 
that should only happen to new pages anyway. Who does lru_cache_add() on 
old pages?
