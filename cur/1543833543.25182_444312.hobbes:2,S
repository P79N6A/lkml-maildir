On the basis of the above, I consider the get/put style fix which use
i_count.
This problem is that i_state of the inode is changed while the inode
is freed in xfs filesystem.  And the cause is that the inode release
and xfs_iunpun() can run in parallel.
To fix this problem, I added a pair of igrab()/iput() before and behind
mark_inode_dirty_sync() at xfs_iunpin().  I think this can change it as
follows.
(1)The case that the inode release transaction runs after xfs_iunpin()
is called.
While mark_inode_dirty_sync() is running, igrab() promises that the
inode is alive.
(2)The case that xfs_iunpin() is called after iput() in the inode
release transaction is called(i_count is 0).
mark_inode_dirty_sync() is not called because the igrab() can not get
the inode.
I have made the following patch, but it is not yet tested.
I would like to hear your comment, first.
