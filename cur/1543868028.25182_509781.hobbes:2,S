I still meant for _with_features to have same semantics so calling:
clocksource_get_clock_with_features(CLOCKSOURCE_PM_UNAFFECTED|CLOCKSOURCE_STABLE
 |CLOCKSOURC_ATOMIC|CLOCKSOURCE_64BITS|CLOCKSOURCE_CONTINUOUS);
would be equivalent to calling:
clocksource_get_masked_clock(CLOCKSOURCE_PM_AFFECTED|CLOCKSOURCE_UNSTABLE
 |CLOCKSOURC_NOT_ATOMIC|CLOCKSOURCE_64BITS|CLOCKSOURCE_NOT_CONTINUOUS);
The only difference is that the naming is reversed. i.e. it isn't a
doulbe negative.
perhaps a better name would clocksource_get_clock_must_have() or
clocksource_get_clock_must_be()

The amount of flag stringing should be the same.

Yeah, the problem is that all of the features are negative except for
CLOCKSOURCE_64BIT, so you can't mask for it.

It might be good if something like these explanations could be added as
comments beside the feature flags.
So, if I was a systemtap style user of the clocksource api, I'd still have to
do something like:
init() {
	// assume this gives me the tsc
	clock = clocksource_get_masked_clock(CLOCKSOURCE_NOT_ATOMIC);
	register a cpu_freq notifier
}
trace() {
	trace.time =
	compute_cyc2_ns_by_hand_using_info_from_cpu_freq(clocksource_read(clock))
}
In this case it doesn't look like using the clocksource stuff helps this
style of user much as all that is abstracted away is really the reading
the tsc. On the other hand it sounds like if you want all this stuff
taken care of for you, most people should be using do_gettimeofday()
instead.
