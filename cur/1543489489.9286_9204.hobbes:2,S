Make the map, find out where mmap() put it, then munmap() it.  Bingo, one
empty map (i.e. one that will SEGV when you access it) that is
exactly the right size.
Hmmm...of course, you now have to prevent anything from mmap()ing a page
into the empty area afterwards.  Does mmap() with no access bits
(PROT_READ/PROT_WRITE etc) work, i.e. create a mapping that you can't access?
