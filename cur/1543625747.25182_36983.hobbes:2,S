I guess I jumped the gun, and have proven that vesafb support is still in the 
latest stable.  My bad.
I'm using LILO version 21.7-5 as a boot loader.  Much to my chagrin I was 
finally able to get vesafb support on a machine running a RedHat 7.2 default 
lilo version(can't get at that machine at the moment to obtain the version 
diff).
I'm using the above mentioned version of lilo specifically for graphical boot 
time splash screen support.
I now need to determine if this lilo version supports some other method of 
manipulating video modes.  Which I guess no longer belongs in this forum.
thanks,
William
