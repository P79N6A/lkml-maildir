After having looked at Eric's patch, I can tell that he does all these 
dereferences in quite the same amount.
For example, lot's of skb->sk->host->...
while in OpenVZ it would be econtainer()->... which is essentially 
current->container->...
So until someone did measurements it looks doubtfull that one solution 
is better than the another.

why not simply container->subsys_namespace?
