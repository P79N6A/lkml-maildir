Subject: [PATCH] KVM: Avoid calling smp_call_function_single() with interrupts disabled
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

When taking a cpu down, we need to hardware_disable() it.  Unfortunately,
the CPU_DYING notifier is called with interrupts disabled, which means
we can't use smp_call_function_single().  Fortunately, the CPU_DYING notifier
is always called on the dying cpu, so we don't need to use the function at
all and can simply call hardware_disable() directly.
