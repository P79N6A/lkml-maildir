then don't go through ACPI

the kexec switch being posted requires ACPI be disabled, so it's clearly 
possible to switch kernels and initialize devices without ACPI

when a kexec is called, how does the kernel know what to execute? 
something needs to tell it what to do, and I think that something is 
either something in the kexec image, or it's something passed as a 
parameter to that image.
all that would be needed to do #3 safely is to have the kernel that you 
restarted on #2 do a suspend-to-ram before it does anything else.
