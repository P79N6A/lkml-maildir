Keyword: partitions. I.e., they partition the hard drive (so that the first 
31 sectors are available for GRUB) and use LVM on devices such as /dev/hda2. 
But this is not what was needed. I need to use LVM on /dev/hda, without a 
partition table.

[wild guess] Maybe they set up a raid1 /boot partition?
