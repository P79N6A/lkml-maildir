I was never speaking to intent.
I was noting that, having been in the kernel community for years, both 
of you guys should know that you should always CC a driver author, when 
touching their driver.
Even after this thread, I have not even heard a "yes, I agree, I should 
have CC'd the driver author since they know the most about the driver" 
from either of you, which is quite disappointing.
Instead, I get this long thread in response...

Sure.  But... do you agree the CC list should have included the driver 
author?  Do you agree that a mistake was made in this case?
