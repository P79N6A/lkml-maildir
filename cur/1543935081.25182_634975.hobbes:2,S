That's not the issue.  We _don't_ allow all of the operations in 
device_del() preceding the call to device_pm_remove().  In particular, 
the call to the device's driver's remove method will deadlock because 
device_release_driver() always has to acquire dev->sem.

No -- the whole idea here is to print an error message in the system
log if a driver's resume method tries to call device_del().  Deadlock 
is unavoidable in this case, but at least we'll know which driver is 
guilty.
