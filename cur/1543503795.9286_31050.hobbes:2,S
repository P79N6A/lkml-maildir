I get about 14 grep hits for "sunsite" in ../Documentation. Only one in
Configure.help, and I emailed an edit to the maintainer of that section
(or someone who knows exactly the right guy). Not bad really in 4 meg or
so, but the sunsite reference in Configure.help is still broke if you in
effect s/sunsite/metalab/, BTW, which is why I mention the general case. 
"sunsite" seems to be a good indicator of stale info. This is in 2.2.10.
