It seems you are talking about a perfect system. Opening a million
files will never be the requirement of my system. You know I'm working
on an embedded system, most of the time the whole system just run for
one application, if I can guarantee this application works forever, I
think it's enough. I'm not trying to make a nommu system act like a
mmu system, it's impossible, I just make my nommu system work.
