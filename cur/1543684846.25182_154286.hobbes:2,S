Subject: [PATCH] Slightly Rearrange README File
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This was suggested by a user yesterday.  I am not sure whom this should go
to, so it's going to the list in general.
Currently, the instructions for installing a kernel source tree are
followed by a section for software requirements in the README file.  This
seems a bit backwards.
The attached patch simply moves the "SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS" section to
before the kernel installation, configuration, and compilation
instructions.
