And it's practically obsolete itself, outside of the ARM directory. What
I'm proposing is something in the Code Maturity menu that's analogous to
EXPERIMENTAL along with a big (UNMAINTAINED) marker next to unmaintained
drivers. Obsolete and unmaintained and deprecated all mean slightly
different things, by the way. So the config option would probably say
'Show obsolete, unmaintained, or deprecated items?' and mark each item
appropriately. Anything that no one made a fuss about by 2.7 would be
candidates for removal.
