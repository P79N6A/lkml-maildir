I changed structure fields from Elf32_Word to __u32. Now, structure is
tied to elf only by its possition <linux/elf.h> and its name
(elf_capabilities). Possition and name of structure are small details,
I believe. I do not want to move structure to other file (so my diff
is small), and I do not know better name (suggest one).

I believe that I can guarantee enough compatibility. In the _worst_
case, I will end with (I believe that will never happen
struct elf_capabilities {
	_fields for old kernels_
	_fields for new kernels_
}
Which is pretty much exactly what you ask for: separate versions for
multiple versions of kernel. Only difference is that I _force_ you to
put fields for older kernels (but setting them to conservative 0/0/0
will save your day).
I believe this will never happen, through. 2 capabilities for 1 file
is nightmare.

You are having year-429496 problem with your date encoding, through
;-))))). (I do not much care what encoding of version you use. It has
to be non-decreasing, and I'd like current version to be 0 so that I
do not have to check for it in code ;-).
