Why is it 'obviously wrong' then?
 Q>    23248 Tue Jan 26 01:41:00 1999 patch-2.2.0-final.bz2
 Q> 10592549 Tue Jan 26 01:41:00 1999 linux-2.2.0.tar.bz2
Curious that the patch you declare to be wrong and the 2.2.0
kernel tarball have identical timestamps if they're for different
kernels...
The above was off the SunSITE-UK mirror of ftp.kernel.org which I have
NFS mounted here...
Best wishes from Riley.
