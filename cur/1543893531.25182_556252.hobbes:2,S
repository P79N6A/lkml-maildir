Unfortunately this also robs non-legacy input handlers (such as
rfkill-input) of input events. Does xf86-input-evdev really needs to
grab devices exclusively? I guess we can't abandon the standard
keyboard driver until X supports hotplugging. How close is it to
support devices coming and going?
If we can't remain as is until X hotplug is ready then I'd rather had
a separate ioctl that disables legacy input handlers (keyboard, mousedev)
for a given input device.
