Subtracting the private key values will not undo the mess.  Back to the
diagram.  += and -= are not atomic in C.
[ On SMP, even if the compiler happens to choose (unlocked)
read-modify-write instructions, the processor divides them into those
three phases using an internal register anyway.  So reg below still
makes sense ].
So:
     Process 0                       Process 1
     ---------                       ---------
     reg = pars->spin
     reg += KEY0
                   <task switch>
                                     reg = pars->spin to 
                                     reg += KEY1
                                     pars->spin = reg
                   <task switch>
     pars->spin = reg
At this point, pars->spin == KEY0.
                   <task switch>
                                     if (pars->spin != KEY1) {
                                       pars->spin -= KEY1;
At this point, pars->spin == KEY0 - KEY1.
                   <task switch>
     if (pars->spin != KEY0) {
       pars->spin -= KEY0;
At this point, pars->spin == -KEY1 and both processes think they have
restored the spin state.  Oh dear.  No-one ever gets the lock after this
point.

Indeed, Ingo's lockless spinlock works using private keys way but not
using non-atomic += and -=.

This loses me.  Can you rephrase?

IMO, only by luck.  far jumps are not defined to be serialising, and do not
flush anything except the prefetch queue (back when there was one).  The
only reason it works here is because of timing.
