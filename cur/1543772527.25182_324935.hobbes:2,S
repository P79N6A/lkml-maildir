Hi all,
I need to statically intialize a structure which looks like:
struct items
{
	int first;
	int *others;
}
Where "others" points to a 0-terminated list of ints.
I plan to initialize it that way:
static struct items s = {
	.first = 1;
	.others = (int[]) {
		2,
		3,
		0
	}
};
It works fine here with gcc 3.3.4. Question is, is this style allowed in
the kernel? I think it's C99 standard. I only found such constructs in
arch/ppc/syslib/mpc*.c and sound/usb/usbquirks.h.
Thanks,
