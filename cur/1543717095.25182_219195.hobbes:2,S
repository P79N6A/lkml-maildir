Actually, what may happen is that since the dentries are added
in the front, a double move like that would result in hash chain
traversal looping. Timing dependent and unlikely, but d_move_count
avoided that theoritical possibility. It is not about skipping
dentries which is safe because a miss would result in a real_lookup()
anyway. If we do the comparison within d_lock, then atleast
we are guaranteed to get the right file. The remaining question
is whether we violate POSIX rename semantics in some twisted way.

Yes, afaics, d_move_count can effectively be used to work around
the possibility of the dentry moving to a different hash bucket.
