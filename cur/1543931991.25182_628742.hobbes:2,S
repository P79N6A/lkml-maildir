Subject: [PATCH] 2.6.24-rc5: Fix build with make O= if the top level Makefile is not present
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
IMHO, something like the patch below is needed to fix builds with "make O=",
since after commit 18c32dac75b187d1a4e858f3cfdf03e844129f5e
"kbuild: fix building with O=.. options" the top-level Makefile is no longer
created automatically if it's not present at all.
Thanks,
Rafael

Make the build system create the top-level Makefile for builds with "make O="
if it is not present already.
