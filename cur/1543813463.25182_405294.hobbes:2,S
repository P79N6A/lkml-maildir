I looked at it and jumped to the wrong conclusion :-)
When I actually simulated it I found that the distribution is in fact
not much different from what I get from rand.  So much for trying to
pin the blame on the hash function.  Next lets try to pin the blame
on vmalloc.  (Spoiler: it's not vmalloc's fault either.)
