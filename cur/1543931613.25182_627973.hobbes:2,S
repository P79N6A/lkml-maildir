Hi,
The behaviour of my mp3 player (also act as usb-storage device) seems
changed from rc5 to rc5-mm1.
<dmesg output under rc5>:
=========

try mount it (or just blockdev --rereadpt), then write protect become off:

sd 4:0:0:0: [sdb] Write Protect is off

sd 4:0:0:0: [sdb] Mode Sense: 03 00 00 00
sd 4:0:0:0: [sdb] Assuming drive cache: write through
 sdb: sdb1
But under rc5-mm1, after mount command being executed, it is just
mouted as read only partition without set the write-protect to off
I tried "blockdev --rereadpt", it do set the write-protect to off as rc5 kernel.
Below is the output of dmesg under rc5-mm1
