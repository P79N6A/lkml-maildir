Oh, sure, it blocks because it asks for it... but not because it _wants_ to 
:)  It wants to create work for X fast enough to make a nice stutter free 
bit of eye-candy.

Yes.  Voluntary or involuntary is just a matter of point of view.

It's due to the scheduler to a point... only in that it doesn't recognize 
the problem and correct it (that might be pretty hard to do).  If my 
hardware were fast enough that X could get the work done in the allotted 
time, the problem wouldn't arise in the first place.  I bet it's fairly 
hard to reproduce on a really fast box.  It happens easily on my box 
because the combination of X and the gl thread need most of what my 
hardware has to offer.
