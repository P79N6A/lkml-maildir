Unfortunately, I a lot of people don't understand that the ";-)"
after this statement and they really think that cpufreq is a
solution for thermal management.  It isn't.  Systems still
need to be thermally sane when they are fully utilized and
cpufreq helps not.

No, you should never have to override your BIOS --
except for debugging.
If Windows works out-of-the-box on this system,
then Linux should too - even if we have to use a DMI-based
workaround for a BIOS bug.
I'm looking forward to seeing the bug report that you are
going to file.  Please include the dmidecode output in addition
to the acpidump output.
thanks,
