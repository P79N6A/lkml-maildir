Then you'ld better check what and where went FUBAR - posting had hit
linux-kernel. 3 times. And if there is a bogus gateway between your list
and l-k it had apppeared right now. Only for your posting. *And* added
Newsgroups: linux.bastards to headers. Methink somebody tries to get you
mailbombed. If you need headers I can mail them to you. It looks like it
went from 202.188.183.200 through 202.188.95.14 and copies had obviously
bogus (and varying) stuff in headers. IMHO you'ld better warn your ISP -
next forgery may be more effective.
						Good luck,
