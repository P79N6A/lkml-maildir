Alan was recently trying to convince people that ipconfig.c should be
deleted from the 2.5 kernel today.  That was until I pointed out that
people do download kernels via xmodem to embedded boards (because that's
what the boot loader supports) and they want to be able to use root-NFS.
I think Alan is reasonably happy for it to stay now, although I haven't
had any hard positive confirmation of that fact.
As long as we don't have equivalent functionality present which replaces
ipconfig.c and nfsroot.c without adding stupidly sized initrd images to
the kernel, I will continue to resist the removal of both of these
features.
klibc provided a way, but if that isn't going to be merged and this stuff
made to work for 2.6, then I think we must keep ipconfig.c and nfsroot.c.
