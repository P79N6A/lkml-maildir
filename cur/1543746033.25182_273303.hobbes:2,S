Oh I see.  After the above page is unlocked, it's temporarily outside
i_size.
Perhaps cont_prepare_write() should look to see if the zerofilled page is
outside the current i_size and if so, advance i_size to the end of the
zerofilled page prior to releasing the page lock.
We might need to run mark_inode_dirty() at some stage, or perhaps just rely
on the caller doing that in ->commit_write().
