The kexec patch has been updated a bit (but this is still diffed
against 2.6.7 vanilla).  It WorksForMe (x86-32), using kexec-tools
(/sbin/kexec) to reboot or using sysvinit reboot (with patch
below) to reboot.  /sbin/kexec is used to load the new kernel
image in either case.
PPC32/GameCube port is now added here.  It's home is

There is ongoing work and/or interest in ports for PPC64,
IA-64, and x86-64, but I haven't seen code for them (yet).
