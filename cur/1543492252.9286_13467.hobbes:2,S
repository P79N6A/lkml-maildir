hmm - 160. Can we use a long name or is it limited somewhere else:

nope - that's alot longer than 160 - what would happen if I was under
PAGE_SIZE by less than 160?
The reason for all of this is that I've seen corruption when catting
/proc/net/tr_rif.  Can anyone point me to the documentation on how these
functions should behave? I see some common code in lots of places but I
don't know what it's doing or the method used to handle large entries in
/proc.
Cheers
