Both, and previous kernels back to 2.4.3 have also shown this.
I also replaced via82cxxx_audio.c in 2.4.8 with the latest (.15, 2.4.8 is 
".14b") and recompiled, and the problem persists.
Keep in mind, this isn't a *total* lockup, it's a problem of the UI in 
XMMS and other applications becoming unresponsive. Audio skips from this 
are rare but not unknown to me.
