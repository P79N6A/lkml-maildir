There is another project dealing with this: KGI. This project not
only deals with Linux, but also with NetBSD and Freew:BSD. Together with
the
Linux input layer KGI should support as many keyboards / mice as you can
buy.... Multiple desktop consoles runs fluently, support for full 3D
accellerated desktops (with help from an user space lib: GGI) is almost
there.
I'm still looking at how to connect multiple keyboards, for now I use a
microcontroller on a serial port which gives me 4 keyboards extra.
Unfortunately we're still missing a programmer willing to take a look at
the multiple keyboard / mice issue. The code is almost there, though not
functional yet. For info about KGI please drop by on
http://kgi-wip.sourceforge.net
 or irc.freenode.net #kgi

P.S. For those thinking KGI is still that crazy project doing graphics
accelleration in the kernel trough ioctls, please look again !
