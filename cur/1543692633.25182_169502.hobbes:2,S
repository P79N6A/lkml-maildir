I get none of these problems. That is with a bt878 tv card, G450 agp 
video card, 2.6.0-test5, udma4 enabled, and using xawtv with xv via the 
v4l module for X.  If i disable dma, the tv is the only thing 
uneffected. This is on a Abit mobo with VIA vt82c686b ide chipset and 
VIA Twister-K/KT133x/KM133 agp chipset (using agpgart). DRI not loaded.
If disabling dma gives you picture distortion, then it seems to me to be 
obvious that Busmastering has nothing to do with the problem and rather 
it's a rendering issue.  If you're using x11 to render the image than it 
will most certainly be effected by heavy io as the kernel will have 
issues scheduling under heavy io, especially in 2.4.   I would check to 
make sure you're using xv to render the tv window if you have that 
option, if not then maybe that's as best as you can do with X.
