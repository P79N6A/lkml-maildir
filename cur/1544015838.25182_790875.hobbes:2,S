Nope it doesn't save memory on most systems because per cpu is only allocated
based on the CPUs that are actually there. And if you have more than 8
cores you can likely afford a few bytes per CPU.
You would need to cache line pad each entry then, otherwise you risk
false sharing. That would make the array 1K on 128 bytes cache line 
system.  This means on small systems this would actually waste
much more memory.
per cpu avoids that problem completely.
