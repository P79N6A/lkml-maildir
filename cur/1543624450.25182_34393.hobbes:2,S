Hi David,
I *did* see the Pause is enabled message the other day, but I have only
seen it once. It hasn't been seen at all during tests today.

I've just checked the manual;
"Flow control is supported only on Gigabit Ethernet ports. It is enabled
or disabled as part of autonegotiation. If autonegotiation is set to
off, flow control is disabled. When autonegotiation is turned on, flow
control is enabled".
According to the switch, it's set up for autonegotiation and flow
control is set to "SYM";

Sorry to be vague,
