Heh, the NMI is just another place that has the IPI problem. A different
issue to the MTRR. Well, same bug, different place.

Yeah, that is why I found this. The current code calls kfree and such from 
the IPI if it is allocated (not to mention the kmalloc in 
smp_call_function. Both of which can sleep in RT. I was forcing the 
data=NULL case in RT to keep it from entering the allocation code paths. 
But this is where I found the deadlock with MTRR (and NMI).
