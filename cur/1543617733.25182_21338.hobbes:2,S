Is the interrupt in the ACPI PCI IRQ routing table? Basic support for that
is in the latest ACPI patch, 20011218 (www.sf.net/projects/acpi), it'll
print the _PRT entries during boot. However, the info isn't used to
actually setup the routing, so it won't help your problem. I have a patch
which uses the ACPI table for setting up IRQ routing, that should make
sure system work properly.
