Probably not unrelated.  I have one of those Cypress-based hubs; it's nice
except for the heat/power, which precludes using them in bus-powered mode
with a laptop (or anything) ... I don't much like wall-warts!
It might be too much to expect that when that hub's upstream port is
suspended, its power usage goes to something reasonable.
