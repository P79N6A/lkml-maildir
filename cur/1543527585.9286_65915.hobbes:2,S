It's fairly non-intrustive.  (I should also have pointed out
that it's untested :)  To test it, you have want to boot with
"console=null console=tty0".  That way, you should see all
kernel messages on a tty, but no messages from userspace there.
That could be useful if it causes an oops or two (it does have
a few NULL methods where other console drivers have real ones).
It should be easy to apply to 2.2 kernels, at least manually,
but it's against the 2.3.47 vger CVS tree, I think.
Matthew.
