Thanks for the pointer, I was unable to find it when I was assing ICH4
support - and most board-maker sites at that time advertised ATA-133.

Actually, it doesn't support ATA-100 correctly either. It has a 133MHz
base clock, and for ATA-100 uses a 3 clock cycle. 133MHz/3*2byte = 88.6 MB/sec.
So the maximum documented speed on ICH chips is 88.6 write, and 100.0
read - because there the drive dictates the speed.

Agreed. Martin, please do that. Also, please change the Config.in
comment to something like "Enable undocumented ATA-133 on ICH chips",
or somehting alike..

No, I don't. ICH4 was designed to have ATA-133 capability, Intel
probably downgraded that in the spec because of some problems.
