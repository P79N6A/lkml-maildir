I should make it clear. This patch _will_ adversely affect interactivity 
because your test case desires that I/O bound tasks get higher priority, and 
this patch will do that. This means that I/O bound tasks will be more 
noticeable now. The question is how much do we trade off one for the other. 
We almost certainly are biased a little too much on the interactive side on 
the mainline kernel at the moment.
