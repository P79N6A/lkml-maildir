Ok, pulled.
However, fixing up a trivial conflict in i386/Makefile, I noticed this:
	cflags-$(CONFIG_REGPARM) += $(shell if [ $(call cc-version) -ge 0300 ] ; then \
				    echo "-mregparm=3"; fi ;)
and it strikes me that this is WRONG.
It's wrong for some subtle reasons: it means that CONFIG_REGPARM is set 
whether or not it is actually _used_, which means that anybody who depends 
on CONFIG_REGPARM in the sources is just screwed.
Now, for this particular usage, the only breakage is in the i386 
<asm/module.h>, which will report "REGPARM" in MODULE_REGPARM regardless 
of whether the kernel was compiled with -mregparm=3 or not. So it's mainly 
cosmetic.
But it strikes me that we'd be a _lot_ better off if the Kconfig phase 
would check the compiler version, instead of us checking it dynamically a 
hundred times in the Makefiles. It would be more efficient, and we could 
make things like this more _correct_. 
Comments?
