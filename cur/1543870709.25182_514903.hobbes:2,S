You apparently have no idea of the mathematic formulae used.
This formulae has a meaning *only* if EXP_1, EXP_5, EXP_15 are directly 
computed from the exact LOAD_FREQ value. If you change it 'randomly' without 
changing the EXP_... you basically compute a wrong value... So what ? Do you 
want to impress your boss with a given value ?
Please dont mess it. Just ignore the avenrun values and let it die.
You can change it to suit your needs, but it wont suit every needs.
Imagine for example your task is awaken for 1us periods every HZ.
Basically your cpu load should be HZ/1000000 (machine mostly idle)
But computed 'load' will be 1.0
This whole avenrun[] thing is plain stupid anyway. The load should be 
something between 0 and 1 (per cpu), to get a precise idea of cpu_power 
used/unused. Nobody mentioned avenrun[] values on lkml in the last decade.
