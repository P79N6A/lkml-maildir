I'm curious - how does this help?
If the kernel jumps into nirvana, it will page fault.  is_prefetch()
will do a __get_user which will fault - recursion, ok.  The inner
fault handler will reach fixup_exception(), fixup the __get_user, and
return without recursing further.  is_prefetch() will simply return.
So how does the above test help?

In addition to needing get_cpu() to protect the GDT access, this code
needs to take down(&current->mm->context.sem) for the LDT access.
Otherwise, context.ldt may have been vfree()'d by the time you use it,
and the desc[0..1] accesses will panic.
