There's certainly a strong correlation between "first sign-off" and 
authorship, but signing off doesn't guarantee it, and while it's not the 
bulk of patches, it certainly happens that people sign off on patches made 
by others (either because the company has specific people who have the 
right to sign off on things, or simply because the code comes from some 
source that did GPL it, but perhaps didn't sign off on it - hopefully 
rare, but certainly not impossible or unheard of especially for 
one-liners that got picked up from mailing lists etc)
