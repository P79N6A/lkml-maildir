Hi,
And another compile error in 2.2.4:
cls_fw.c: In function `fw_dump':
cls_fw.c:306: structure has no member named `police'
make[3]: *** [cls_fw.o] Error 1
Let's have a look at it:
struct fw_filter
{
        struct fw_filter        *next;
        u32                     id;
        struct tcf_result       res;
#ifdef CONFIG_NET_CLS_POLICE
        struct tcf_police       *police;
#endif
};
Right, I didn't enable CONFIG_NET_CLS_POLICE, but the lines around line 306
in that file ain't surrounded by #ifdef CONFIG_NET_CLS_POLICE #endif.
Regards,
 -Remco
