We sync the file metadata once per write() syscall.  If your app writes a
large file in lots of little bits, it'll do a lot of syncs.  Other
implementations of fatfs will (must) do the same thing.

fatfs used to be buggy - it didn't implement `-o sync'.  Now it does, and
what we're seeing is the fallout from the late fixing of that bug.
You're right - people need to understand what they're doing, make their own
decision, then remove the `-o sync' option.  There aren't any easy
solutions.
