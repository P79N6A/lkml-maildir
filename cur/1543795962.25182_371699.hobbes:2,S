If other CPUs use this then fine, but I find that having config options
needlessly available to all architectures is annoying - especially when
they are never used.
Eg, would you ever expect to see a DM9000 ethernet device on an x86
machine?  Probably not - there's far better PCI solutions now.
So until someone says "I want to use this on such and such arch" I
think it's better to keep it dependent on those we know are likely
to support it.
