I guess you're using "git pull" to update a local branch? That will try
to merge the new state of x86/mm into your local branch, and that
breaks. If you just want to have a local branch that gives you a "fixed"
state of x86/mm regardless of whether or not you already fetched newer
ones, you can do:
git branch myThing x86/mm # create the branch
work/test/whatever
To fetch a new "state" from the remote:
git fetch x86/mm # or git remote update, or whatever
To update your branch to point to the new state:
git branch - f myThing x86/mm
That basically replaces it with a new branch of the same name, but
pointing to the new x86/mm.
Or if you want to get your working tree to that state at the same time,
you can also do:
git checkout myThing
git reset --hard x86/mm
