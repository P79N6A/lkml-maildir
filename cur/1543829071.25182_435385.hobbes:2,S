Subject: PROBLEM: compilation error when including asm/system.h in user mode code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Description:
Starting 2.6.15 'include/asm-i386/system.h' has lines (301-304)
extern unsigned long cmpxchg_386_u8(volatile void *, u8, u8);
extern unsigned long cmpxchg_386_u16(volatile void *, u16, u16);
extern unsigned long cmpxchg_386_u32(volatile void *, u32, u32);
Here u8, u16, u32 types used in nonkernel namespace producing undefined type
errors.
Solution:
Rename types to __u8, __u16, __u32.
Since a few distributions derive their glibc kernel headers directly from
kernel the problem is quite relevant.
Regards,
A. Chentsov.
