Sorry forgot to mention: I'm running FC6 with the 2.6.19-1.2895.fc6 x86_64 
kernel.
RPM says that it is based on:
* Wed Jan 10 2007 Dave Jones <davej@redhat.com>
- 2.6.19.2
I tried to upgrade to the forcedeth driver that is supplied with 2.6.20-rc4-mm1
but that gave results that look like Tobias' description.
Then I downloaded the Nvidia provided version from:
http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/nforce/1.21/NFORCE-Linux-x86-1.21.zip
The forcedeth driver from this file announces itself as:
Version 0.60-Driver Package V1.21.
After some minor patching I got this to work with the FC6 2.6.19-1.2895 kernel
and I just played 2 movies through the network whilst downloading a large number
of files onto the server. So far no network crashes. Maybe something for David
to try out as well?
Thanks for the information,
With kind regards,
Jeroen
