I've noticed on lkm another bug report which has pointed me to this:
ata_piix 0000:00:1f.1: version 2.00ac7
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:1f.1[A] -> GSI 18 (level, low) -> IRQ 18
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:1f.1 to 64
ata1: PATA max UDMA/100 cmd 0x000101f0 ctl 0x000103f6 bmdma 0x0001ffa0 irq 14
ata2: PATA max UDMA/100 cmd 0x00010170 ctl 0x00010376 bmdma 0x0001ffa8 irq 15
scsi0 : ata_piix
ata1.00: ATA-6: ST9100824A, 3.04, max UDMA/100
ata1.00: 195371568 sectors, multi 16: LBA48
ata1.01: ATAPI, max UDMA/33
ata1.00: configured for UDMA/33
ata1.01: configured for UDMA/33
Both ports are for some reason configured as UDMA/33.
