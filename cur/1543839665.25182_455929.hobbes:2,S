Normally, when I merged a patch, you will receive a one-word reply
"applied" or "merged".  Or for a series of patches, "applies patches 1-6".
For this series of patches, you will need to resend the entire patchset,
modified with the comments so far.
It is quite normal for some patchsets to undergo several iterations
before being merged, when engineering review highlights issues.
Thanks and regards,
Jeff
