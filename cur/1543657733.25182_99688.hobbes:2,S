Looks OK.

Not under our jurisdiction.

Actually CONFIG_ARIADNE2 and CONFIG_NE2K_ZORRO are the same. We introduced the
latter in the old Configure.help when the Ariadne II driver got X-Surf support,
but forgot to replace the former in the Makefile logic. And the driver is still
called ariadne2.c.
linux-m68k: Should we kill CONFIG_NE2K_ZORRO, or kill CONFIG_ARIADNE2 and
rename the driver to ne2k-zorro.c?

Looks OK.

Mainly to avoid seeing too many entries for devices we can't support (e.g. old
ISA adapters)...

Disclaimer: I didn't try to compile, I just looked at the patches.
