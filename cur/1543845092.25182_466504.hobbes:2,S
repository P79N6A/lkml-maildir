Hi!

When people stop asking me for graphical progress.
Alternatively, when you strip down suspend2 patches so that they are
smaller than 2 * (sizeof(swsusp + uswsusp kernel parts)).

Of course you are right. Fortunately for us, that high level logic is
80% of code. Unfortunately for you, that high level logic is where the
ugly parts are.... such as "press esc to abort". such as "image found,
do you want to reboot and try again or destroy it?".

PMOPS_PREPARE (& friends) is "tell ACPI to light up that moon
symbol". Useful suspend can be done without that, but ACPI will be
confused on resume.
We could do it unconditionaly, but some machines have broken ACPI bioses.
