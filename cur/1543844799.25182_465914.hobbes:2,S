Not sure about the need for asm-foo/marker.h if the file contains no
code at all. If there's going to be one marker.h per arch, it might
as well have a purpose. So instead of:

and

Why not just have asm-foo/marker.h either implement the optimization
or point to an asm-generic/marker.h which contains the non-optimized
code. No #ifndefs needed.

My understanding of Ingo's input is that he'd rather not have this
multiple options. Either the markers are active or they aren't.
So ...
MARK_ACTIVE ... speaks for itself, enables both the markers and
the set/disable infrastructure. Markers are enabled in their
optimized per-architecture implementation.
MARK_FORCE_DIRECT_CALL ... forces all markers to be non-optimized
(good for embedded systems where the image is in rom/flash and
can therefore not have runtime binary modifications.) Maybe this
should depend on CONFIG_EMBEDDED.
