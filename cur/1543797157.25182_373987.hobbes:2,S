Anyone know of any applications that *DO* depend on the per-irq counters
in /proc/stat?
I could just add IA64 to the ugly #ifdef:
-#if !defined(CONFIG_PPC64) && !defined(CONFIG_ALPHA)
+#if !defined(CONFIG_PPC64) && !defined(CONFIG_ALPHA) && !defined(CONFIG_IA64)
But perhaps it might be simpler to skip straight to this:
[PATCH] Drop per-irq counters from /proc/stat
It is very expensive to produce the per-irq counter values in /proc/stat
(the code does a very cache unfriendly walk across all percpu structures
for each irq).  Some architectures (PPC64, ALPHA) don't provide this
information in this file.  Applications which do want this can derive it
by adding the percpu values in /proc/interrupts.
