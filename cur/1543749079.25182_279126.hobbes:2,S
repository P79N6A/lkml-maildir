As you might be aware, netfilter/iptables has an enormously large
codebase (I'd say even larger than what is in the tree) in the so-called
patch-o-matic subsystem.  The abovementioned exports facilitate those
modulse, and A certain amount of those new modules (especially the ones
requiring the functions above) are scheduled for mainline inclusion over
the next couple of months.

This can be removed, yes.  Please be aware that ipfwadm and ipchains
will be removed soon (after 2.6.10 is out), so that won't be a problem
any more :)

Mh, I don't really understand why this change was introduced.  My
original _irc code didn't have this global variable...  I'll try to
track the change and get back to you.
