Problem.  There are a large number of IDR changes pending and this
patch breaks in way which I am not at all confident in fixing.
Originarily I'd just dump the earlier patches because bugfixes come
first.  But this time there's a very large dependency trail on the
earlier patches (especially Tejun's extensive sysfs rework in Greg's
driver tree) so the wreckage would be extensive.
Also, it's possible that Tejun's changes already fixed some of the things
which you fixed.  Or added new bugs ;)
Bottom line: a reworked patch against 2.6.22-rc6-mm1 would be muchly
appreciated if poss, please.
While you're there, it would be helpful if you could review all these
pending IDR changes:
