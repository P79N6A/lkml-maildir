This is a good indictation of a missed wake up.  Now the question is, what
is sleeping and why didn't it wake up.

Hmm, do you have high res timers turned on?

Could you hook up a serial, and on the machine do a
  # cat /dev/ttyS0 &
Just to open the serial for reading.  And then on the machine on the other
end of the serial cable, bring up minicom, do a ctrl-a f t
ctl-a f sends a break,
the t will do a task dump.  Do this when the machine is stopped and see
what is running.  Hopefuly the sysrq works from serial (I've had boxes
where the keyboard sysrq didn't work but serial did).
Oh, and send me the output too.
Thanks,
