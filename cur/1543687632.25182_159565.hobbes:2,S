Okay, I applied O18 on top of test2 now. Xmms works as a charm,
programm start is still slow while doing an tar xf linuxtest2.tar.
Already open xterm's (one with mutt) react a bit in-interactive (I spawn
vi to write this email and a :w takes 5 seconds). It is nonetheless
worse than O10, sorry to say that.
