I see your point, but there is a level of control on the branch I would
lack by doing so: the ability to put the call in either the if or else
branch. It is an optimization on i386.
I could do it by defining my home-made if() :
cond_if (cond_call_name) {
  code
}
The macro cond_if could then expand (this is a simplified example) in either in
if (cond)
or
if (cond)
else
Also, I live in the expectation that, someday, the gcc guys will be nice
enough to add some kind of support for a nop-based jump that would
require code patching to put a jump instead. If it ever happens, my
macro could evolve into this for newer compiler versions, which I could
not do with the if() statement you are proposing.
