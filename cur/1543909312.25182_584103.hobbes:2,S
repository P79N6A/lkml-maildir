While on x86 it is roughly identical (although the low level
allocator is currently not very reliable) it makes a significant
difference on some platforms. e.g. I was told on PA-RISC
consistent memory is much more costly than non consistent ones.
That's probably true on anything that's not full IO cache
consistent.
So while it would be reasonable semantics for x86 and IA64
it's not for everybody else.
