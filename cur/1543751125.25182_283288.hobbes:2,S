Subject: Purpose of do{}while(0) in #define spin_lock_init(x)	do { (x)->lock = 0; } while(0)

Just for information, may be very simple.
Is there any specific reason why do{}while(0) is 
there in this definition
#define spin_lock_init(x)	do { (x)->lock = 0; } while(0)
What could happen if it is replaced by
#define spin_lock_init(x)	{ (x)->lock = 0; } 
There are couple of other places, where this kind of usage
is observed in the kernel code.
Thanks and Regards
Deepak
