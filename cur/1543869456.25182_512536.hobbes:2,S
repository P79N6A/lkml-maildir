No, I think you're getting confused by the way Linus uses access_ok
on the address range given with the access_ok on the vector address.
Before and after, an access_ok failure on the output vector address
gives -EFAULT.  Before and after, an invalid address in the range
to be inspected gives -ENOMEM.
Which is consistent with the other m* system calls: -EFAULT if
arguments are inaccessible, -ENOMEM if address range is invalid.
