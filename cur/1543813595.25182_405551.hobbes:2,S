That would only intermittently stop prefetching whenever both happened to use 
cpu at exactly the same time (which is the desired effect). So playing audio 
will slow prefetch a little but it will still prefetch.

That's what Peter is promoting here. I could use the "weighted load" value to 
determine just that, and keep running prefetch if highly niced tasks are 
running. I am considering adding that in the future. For the moment I 
definitely think opting out of prefetching whenever anything is running is 
the right thing to do.
