Place your filesystems on LVN, when they grow the number of inodes grows to
match. Or did you run out of inodes and not of diskspace? Only ever
happened to me on (static) /dev, or (wrong configured) newsspools...

/One/ tool that did the job. Not "the" right one, perhaps not even the best
one.

If you know that, you configure your filesystem like a newsspool or some
such.

Get a clue by for, apply to the vendor (for the design, or at the very
least for not warning unsuspecting users)?

Or reconfigure the filesystem with more inodes (you were willing to rebuild
the filesystem in any case, so...)

18GiB = 18 million KiB, you do have a point there. But 40 million files on
that, with some space to spare, just doesn't add up.
