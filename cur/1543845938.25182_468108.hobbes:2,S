OK, it's definitely something in those 2 commits - I reverted them and the
resulting 2.6.18-mm2 kernel has been up and stable for 4 hours, even with
the problem gkrellm updating once a second the whole time.
I'm not *seeing* how those changes can cause trouble - unless it's this:

Does some other code go batshit if length ==0?  My current config doesn't
try to actually ifup the wireless if I also have connectivity via copper (in
order to avoid chewing up a DHCP lease in crowded address space if not needed).
