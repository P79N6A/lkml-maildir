No, we argued that _if_ you don't do real -rc's no amount of renaming 
will trick people into believing they are (for long). Note how that's 
what has happened now. Your -rc's are -pre's, certainly the first ones 
for each kernel, and that's exactly how people treat them -- that is, 
many avoid them.
Doing -rc1 to release and beyond from that per-release "sucker tree" as 
you call it (I prefer "release tree") makes more sense. This gets you 
real release management and the only thing left to do is appoint the 
release manager.

It's not unsolveable. Doing real -pre's and -rc's (which means "doing 
doing real -rc's" in addition to the current situation) would at least 
to a degree solve it.

Judging by the fact that apparently you know have to few testers "seeing 
right through Linus" would seem to be everybody else's, though.
