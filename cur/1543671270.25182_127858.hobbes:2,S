In this context, the only thing I know has been openly discussed
is to have a BIOS that includes a public key of my choosing for
authentication.

Not so because in a general purpose system the owners of the
system control the keys.

Redhat's kernel is unlikely to get my signature.  Possibly
at some point there will be a web of trust where that will work
but in the first approximation distributors kernels will not
load until I sign them.

Yes.  And there has been some limited discussion on LinuxBIOS list
about implementing these.
