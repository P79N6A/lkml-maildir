You might also want to try 2.6.5-rc2 which has a set of reiserfs fixes
from 2.4.x.  I'm hoping those will clean things up for you.
2.6.5-rc2-mm3 and higher have a number of other reiserfs performance
fixes, but most of those were not in 2.4.  Trying them out will
complicate the picture (although I'm still interested in numbers from
-mm).
