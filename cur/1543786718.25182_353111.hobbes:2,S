You're still rather vague here...
Anyway, if the amount of active timer should be a problem, there are ways 
to avoid them. For disk io it's rather simple as the timeout is mostly 
constant:
start i/o:
	req->expire = jiffies + timeout;
	list_add_tail(req->list, &timeout_list);
	if (!timer_pending(timer)) {
		timer->expire = req->expire;
		add_timer(timer);
	}
timeout function:
	req = list_head(&timeout_list);
	if (time_after_eq(req->expire, jiffies)) {
		// error...
	} else {
		timer->expire = req->expire;
		add_timer(timer);
	}
Network timer are a bit more difficult as the timeouts are more dynamic, 
but one can at least delay arming the timer in most cases, by running a 
timer every x ticks:
start timer:
	if (timeout < x)
		add_timer();
	else
		list_add_tail();
timer function:
	list_for_each_entry()
		add_timer();
Should the action be successfull before the timer runs, it only needs to 
remove it from the private list.

First, please don't say API if you talk about subsystems, it's not the 
same. APIs are part of a subsystem and describe the relationships between 
subsystems. I think that caused a major part of the confusion.
I don't completely agree with your picture above and while these 
subsystems are mostly separate, they are not independent:
current dependencies:
	1. time source ---> 2. wallclock    ---> 4. process timer
	                \-> 3. kernel timer -/
We have currently a very simple time source, which just provides a 
nonprogrammable timer interrupt. Process timer are limited in their 
(programmable) resolution to kernel.
This maybe also explains better the 3 types of time I mentioned (or 
domains if you prefer):
- wallclock time: NTP controlled, only readable and not programmable
- scheduler time: monotonic and unsynchronized, readable and programmable 
  in HZ resolution
- process time: derived from the first two.
Johns work now (hopefully) integrates wallclock functionality into the 
time source:
	time source ---> wallclock time
	ntp library -/
This means the NTP code becomes a library which can be used by the time 
source to provide a synchronized wallclock time.
The next step would be to make the time source programmable, so that we 
can get rid of the kernel timer dependency from the process timer:
	time source ---> kernel timer
	             \-> process timer
In this context the main functionality of your patch now finally becomes 
understandable: making process timer independent of kernel timer. This 
never became clear from your announcement, it talks about a lot of 
unrelated problems, but it never gets to the actual problem.
bye, Roman
