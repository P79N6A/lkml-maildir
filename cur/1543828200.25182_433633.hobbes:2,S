It happened again, but this time on just one of the two computers:
[20770.844282] hda: tray open
[20770.844288] end_request: I/O error, dev hda, sector 0
[20770.844292] Buffer I/O error on device hda, logical block 0
Since you think LVM may be misbehaving, I changed the filter on the 
affected computer to read
filter = [ "r|/dev/cdrom|", "r|/dev/hda|", "r|/dev/ide|" ]
Ironically, that's on the computer that threw the error, so it could 
be more evidence LVM has a problem if it is indeed the cause or 
further evidence that it isn't involved.
The kernel on this amd64-based computer is now 2.6.16.20. LVM is 
version 2.02.05 (versions from Gentoo packages). Device mapper is 
1.02.07 and udev is 090.) Since I'm shooting in the dark, cc'd to the 
gentoo ml since this system is gentoo-based (2005.0 profile).
