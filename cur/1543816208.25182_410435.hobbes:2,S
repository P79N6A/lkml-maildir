+       if (jiffies - last <= fsevent_ratelimit) {
+               if (fsevent_sum > fsevent_burst_limit)
+                       return -2;
+               fsevent_sum++;
Only process (and not process' syscall) can preempt us here, 
so fsevent_sum can only exceed fsevent_burst_limit by one per process
(process can not preempt itself, so when it has finished syscall which
ends up in event generation, fsevent_sum will be increased).
+       } else {
+               last = jiffies;
+               fsevent_sum = 0;
+       }
Actually, since jiffies and atomic operations are already used, I do not
think addition of new atomic_inc_return or something similar will 
even somehow change the picture.
