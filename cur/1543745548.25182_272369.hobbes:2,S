Subject: RFC: let x86_64 no longer define X86
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

I'd like to send a patch after 2.6.10 that removes the following from 
arch/x86_64/Kconfig:
  config X86
        bool
        default y
Additionally, I'll also check all current X86 uses to prevent breakages.
Why?
X86 is _the_ symbol to identify the i386 architecture, but the x86_64 
port hijacked it. Kernel-wise, x86_64 is mostly simply a new port like 
e.g. ia64.
Where is the problem?
To say "X86", you currently have to write "(X86 && !X86_64)" in the 
Kconfig file. This is not intuitive.
Why is e.g. CONFIG_LBD available on x86_64 and even enabled in 
defconfig?
Isn't this an incompatible change?
Yes it is.
But according to the current development model, such changes are allowed 
in 2.6 .
And if you want to support both older and more recent kernels, the 
following dependencies will be correct both before and after this 
change:
- (X86 && !X86_64)
- (X86 && X86_64)
