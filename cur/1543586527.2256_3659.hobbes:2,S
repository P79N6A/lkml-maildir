There is value in putting it into the Linux kernel source tree, in
linux/scripts dir.  But most vendors can and should take this script as
a sample, and customize it for their distro.  The Linux-Mandrake
installkernel script definitely gets touched every so often, and
decisions it makes, like updating lilo.conf or grub/menu.lst, or
autodetecting the boot loader, are definitely not to be applied for all
cases.
FWIW here is our /sbin/installkernel command line usage help text, to
give a glimpse of what it does and can do:
Usage: ${0##*/} -[lngarhcq] KERNEL_VERSION BOOTIMAGE MAPFILE
  -l:  Add a lilo entry
  -i:  Dont generate Initrd files           
  -n:  Don't launch lilo.
  -g:  Add a Grub entry.
  -d:  Don't autodetect boot loader.
  -a:  Autodetect boot loader.
  -r:  Features for RPM post install.
  -c:  Don't copy files.
  -q:  Be quiet.
  -h:  This help.

There will never be an official place to put this stuff, because that's
a distro policy decision.  A quick search just now reveals no reference
to /boot in the i386 Makefiles, and only a quick reference in the README
file.

Additionally, everyone should remember: /proc is not a dumping ground :)
Ad-hoc naming like this has created the procfs namespace ugliness we
have now... let's not add to it unless we have to, and unless we have a
good idea of proper naming.
