Correct, machines are not idle... but 
 - they are doing globally the same work,
 - this behavior is something I can reproduce test after test, since
   I've started this morning...
I started using that because IP1 was exhibiting high latency yesterday
'til I rebooted it, and since it is working quite fine...
Of course, I can reboot also IP2, but I'd like to understand why
and how to avoid it later...
Regards,
Paul
