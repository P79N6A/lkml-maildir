This document describes the generic GPIO interface which is used by the
i2c-gpio driver as well as many others. I don't think it should be
associated with this particular driver.
Patches for Documentation/gpio.txt should probably be sent to
linux-arch and David Brownell, who is the one who wrote it.

The other patches I was Cc'ed on (77, 78, 81 and 82) all look good to
me.
