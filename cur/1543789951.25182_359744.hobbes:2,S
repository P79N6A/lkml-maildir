My concern was to not cause a detriment to performance in any noticeable way. 
The prefetch sizes were tested on a number of machines with different speed 
hard drive / ram size combinations to ensure none of the default values ever 
caused any significant I/O wait, or that heavy memory requiring compiles took 
any longer to complete as these constantly need new ram allocations and I 
wanted to ensure that prefetching into ram didn't slow down those 
allocations. Furthermore, the time taken to actually prefetch the application 
is now more than 5 times faster because of the larger default prefetch 
values.
Cheers,
Con
