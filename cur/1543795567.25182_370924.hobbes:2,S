I don't, he's subject to errors just like any of us mere humans. I
wouldn't like anybody telling me he trusts my scripts or makefiles
and blindly runs them as root.

I have an anecdote : several years ago, a collegue replaced me on a
benchmark platform during my hollidays. He wrote a few scripts to
help the guy doing the benchmarks, and one of his scripts archived
the logs and removed all the log directory and sub-directories to
prepare it for another run. When I came back, the guy doing the
benchs asked me to run this fresh new script to archive the logs,
which I tried. Unfortunately, it had to be run outside the log
directory so that it could find the directory name. One of its
lines was "rm -rf $LOGDIR/". Believe me, even on this Digital Unix
Alpha, it took a very long time to purge the directory when LOGDIR
was void, and we had to reinstall everything from scratch !

Sudo generally helps here. It's even easy to put $SUDO in front
of sensible commands in build scripts and have SUDO=${SUDO-sudo}
at the beginning of the script.
