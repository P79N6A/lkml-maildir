Hi
So I've check some   find /sys/device | grep usb | grep power/wakeup
and there was no difference.
I've updated to latest git to be in sync
(e0b325d310a6b11f1538413fd557d2eb98f2fae5)
I'm still keeping reverted commit: 6fd9086a518d4f14213a32fe6c9ac17fabebbc1e.
And I've figured out - the only  'modprobe -r ehci_hcd' is enough to
keep my suspend/resume sequence working. (Though I would have say,
that now it takes fairly noticable time to get keyboard and synaptics
usable - but it might be connected with my move to evdev and hal... :)
)
So I'm adding cc: to David - maybe he has some suspected patches for
ehci_hcd ? (as doing a bisect in such a broken merge window is going
to give me probably a lot of unsable kernels nowdays....)
