Yes It was always crashing until I deleted all InnoDB files and restored
InnoDB tables from backup.

Yes, now it seems for me that this particular crash in not related to linux
kernel at all.
The funny thing I've managed to get another InnoDB crash on the same box
http://sysadminday.org.ru/linux-2.6.0-test4_InnoDB_crash-20030828
which in turn was posted to linux-kernel over a two hours ago.
This time the cheksums are different :(

In fact I'm also a happy InnoDB user. It runs fine on 6 of my production
servers. Thanks for a nice work btw!
It has worked fine also on our development server until I upgraded it to
2.6.0-testX. I don't know. It might be just a broken hardware
which is better stressed with 2.6 than with 2.4...
