Subject: seriel console support broken in -mm4 and -mm5

It works fine in -rc2.
-mm4 prints jibberish (wrong speed / settings?) for serial console, but
the getty stuff comes out file. shutdown just prints more jibberish.
-mm5 prints about half as much jibberish as -mm4 then hangs, seemingly
halfway through boot.
I guess I'll try linus.patch from -mm4 next, unless you have any other
suggestions that'd be more fruitful ...
