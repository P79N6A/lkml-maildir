If you try to involve a network connection in your mirroring, then the
only safe way to go would be to wait for a write confirmation from the
mirror system before allowing the process to continue.  This would
reduce your disk latency to that offered over NFS.
Multi initiator SCSI, as suggested by others, can work in some
circumstances, it is supported on Sun Hardware by Veritas for there HA
product under Solaris for example, but is not ideal.
The best way has got to be to use a technology designed for multiple
hosts.  FCAL, basically SCSI over Fibre Channel, supports multiple hosts
and there are several PCI cards available.  You could see if anybody has
written a driver for one.  FCAL cards and hardware will clearly be more
expensive than SCSI, but then if it takes you days or weeks to patch and
debug the kernel, at however many dollars per hour you quite correctly
value or charge your time, it could end up being a lot cheaper.
