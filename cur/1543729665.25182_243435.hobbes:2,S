Nonsense (as I just said in another message).

OK, their problem.

Sorry, you have absolutely no say in the development of the kernel
here. You fix your broken app, code freeze or no code freeze. Or let others
that fix it alone.

"Normal" read/write commands are safe, others are off-limits unless you
have the required capability (one which allows you to set the device on
fire at will, that is).

Not unless standard SCSI commands change by the day. And I somewhat doubt
that to be the case.

Right. But better "Funny, it doesn't work here..." than "Sh*t! Another
CD/DVD-writer turned into a brick!".
