Generally yes. You want as much swap as the base daemons/programs take up in
RAM. Any [user] program should probably be allowed to max out your physical RAM
- the daemons go to swap in the meanwhile (mostly works with idle servers). A
program that requires more memory than physically present is anyway going to
swap in and out sometime later, degrading performance to a halt, as you
describe.
