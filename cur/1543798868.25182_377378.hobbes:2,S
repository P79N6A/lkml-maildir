Sorry... This entry was originally real question from akpm, and I did
reply for him. I should have rewritten in when I decided to put it
into FAQ.
This should be better:
Q: How can distributions ship a swsusp-supporting kernel with modular
disk drivers (especially SATA)?
A: Well, it can be done, load the drivers, then do echo into
/sys/power/disk/resume file from initrd. Be sure not to mount
anything, not even read-only mount, or you are going to loose your
data.
