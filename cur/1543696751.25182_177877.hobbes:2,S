These are ACPI events (at least lid and power adaptor).  So, are you
compiling in ACPI support?  If so does it still happen with acpi=off
kernel command line option?  Do you still have keyboard when it freezes?
If so, alt-sysrq-p or alt-sysrq-t show anything useful?  And, finally,
you aren't using an nVidia binary only module for that GeForce are you?
thanks,
