If you want to do it in a really perfect way, help texts aren't the 
solution. You'll have to make the options like CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SR no 
longer be user visible and select'ed through dummy options like e.g.:
config USB_STORAGE
        tristate "USB Mass Storage support"
        depends on USB
	select SCSI
	help
	  ...
config USB_STORAGE_SD
	tristate "USB Mass Storage hard disk support"
	depends on USB_STORAGE
	select BLK_DEV_SD
	help
	  ...
config USB_STORAGE_SR
        tristate "USB Mass Storage CD/DVD support"
        depends on USB_STORAGE
	select BLK_DEV_SR
        help
          ...
