So I wrote a mknod64(1) tool, so we can play with 64-bit device
numbers.  It is available at:
	
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/mknod64
for testing.  And that is really its whole purpose because I see no
reason why the mknod in coreutils will not eventually support
mknod64(2).
But for now this version works and supports the 64-bit dev_t with a
32:32 split.  It is also identical in functionality to mknod(1), except
it does not support an initial mode other than the default (i.e., no
--mode option).
Installation is simple but RPM packages are also available.
Usage is the same as mknod, except you may specify a 32-bit value for
the major and the minor device number.
This currently requires 2.5.67-mm4, but I suspect the 64-bit dev_t work
will eventually make its way into Linus's tree.
Note that most utilities cannot see the 64-bit device numbers, i.e.
ls(1) only displays 8-bits of each.  You can do a homemade stat64() or
just trust the code.
With the above kernel and this utility, you can play with 64-bit device
numbers.  Enjoy.
