Hi,
The following two patches are designed to improve the shrink_all_memory()
function used by swsusp and other pm functions.
The first patch makes shrink_all_memory() overflow-resistant.  The problem is
that, AFAICT, balance_pgdat(pgdat, nr_to_free, 0) may free more than nr_to_free
pages, in which case nr_to_free, being unsigned, will overflow (and obviously
it cannot be less than 0).  Also if the argument is too big, strange things may
happen.
The first patch adds a workaround of the problem that shrink_all_memory() may
return 0 even if there still are some pages to free.  WIth this patch applied
it sometimes frees 2 times as many pages as without it on my box.
Please have a look and comment.
Greetings,
Rafael
