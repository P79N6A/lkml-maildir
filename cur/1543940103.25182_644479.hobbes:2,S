Indeed, by lowering sched_wakeup_granularity I get much better
latencies, but lowering sched_latency seems to be more effective.

Thanks for the patch, it works perfectly.

Having an inconsistency here between FAIR_USER_SCHED and
!FAIR_USER_SCHED sounds strange, but Ingo took the patch, so I'm happy
:-)
Thanks for the replies.
