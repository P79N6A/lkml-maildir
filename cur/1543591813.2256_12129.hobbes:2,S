Ok my fault. Let me try that again with clearer Linux terminology.
Pages allocated in main memory and mapped for access by PCI devices. On some
HP systems there is now way for such a page to stay coherent. It is quite
possible to sync the view but there is no sane way to allow any
pci_alloc_consistent to succeed
