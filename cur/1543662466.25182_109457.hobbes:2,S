Please excuse me if this is not the correct forum.
I have a question about the 2.4.18 kernel.
I am currently trying to use drives larger than 134G on my target system.
I would expect that the CMD680 and CSB6 drivers have been updated since
the 2.4.18 kernel.  Can someone let me know where I can find the most
recent drivers.  I have checked the sources I know for the latest driver and
not had any luck.  I was hoping someone may have a better set of sources.
Thanks in advance for the help.
Larry
