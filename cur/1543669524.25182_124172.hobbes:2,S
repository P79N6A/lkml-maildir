I get an oops on boot in function fb_set_var (called from 
radeon_init_disp).  This might simply be because I don't have the same 
version of fbmem.c (I had to apply that hunk of the patch by hand) 
although I have source of 2.5.67.
Anyone else not able to apply all parts of the patch cleanly?
Anyone else seeing this problem?
