Sparc64 uses some of the upper page->flags bits to store D-cache
flushing state.
Specifically, PG_arch_1 is used to set whether the page is scheduled
for delayed D-cache flushing, and bits 24 and up say which CPU the
CPU stores occurred on (and thus which CPU will get the cross-CPU
message to flush it's D-cache should the deferred flush actually
occur).
I imagine that since we don't support the domain stuff (yet) on sparc64,
your patches won't break things, but it is something to be aware of.
