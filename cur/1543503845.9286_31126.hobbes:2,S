First of all, the external hardware serves as a dongle.
I'd guess you have to pay quite a bit for these tools.
Second of all, I don't think you want to get analog anywhere near
a computer. Think of all the electrical noise.
If I actually cared about perfect audio, I'd do a D->A conversion
inside the microphone. I'd oversample for both time and space,
then downsample inside a custom board. Other than the input itself,
nothing anywhere near an audio frequency would be allowed near the
microphone or cable.
