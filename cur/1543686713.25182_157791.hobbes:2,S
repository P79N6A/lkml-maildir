The Dell TrueMobile 1150 series are Agere/Orinoco/Hermes based (MiniPCI
and PC-Card available). All other Dell TrueMobile cards are Broadcom
based and have no Linux driver support either.
There are also MiniPCI, PC-Card, USB adapters with 802.11a/b/g and Linux
drivers available:

These are based on the Ateros chipset, which also is around in some OEM
products.
