Hi!
As Ben pointed out, swsusp is not doing the right thing with devices
in 2.6.1. I had patch for a long time here, and it needs to go
in... It stops them before copying pages back, so there are no issues
with running DMAs etc.

> idling devices at this point, and that's where I'd call devices_suspend(1),
> and we should do that for kexec too.
