+	  Flash filesystem aimed to scale efficiently to large devices.
+	  In comparison to JFFS2 it offers significantly faster mount
+	  times and potentially less RAM usage, although the latter has
+	  not been measured yet.
+
+	  In its current state it is still very experimental and should

+	  Run a full filesystem check on every mount.  If any errors are
