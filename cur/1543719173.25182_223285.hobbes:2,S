Hi,
when I switched from 2.6.4 kernel to 2.6.5 and 2.6.6 my maestro sound card 
stop working meaning instead of sound I can hear noise. I was using OSS 
matestro3 module.
Here is my profile:
PCI:
02:09.0 Multimedia audio controller: ESS Technology ES1988 Allegro-1 (rev 12)
Modules:
maestro3               36232  0
soundcore               9344  1 maestro3
ac97_codec             19040  1 maestro3
Config:
CONFIG_SND=m
CONFIG_SND_TIMER=m
CONFIG_SND_PCM=m
CONFIG_SND_MAESTRO3=m
CONFIG_SOUND_PRIME=m
CONFIG_SOUND_MAESTRO3=m
the rest is commented out.
Any clue why it stop working? I'm willing to help testing stuff if necessary.
Thanks,
Valentin.
