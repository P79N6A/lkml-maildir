OK... I cannot resist...
Working with large database systems,
(700MHz 32P, 32GB ram, 500-18GB 15K drives)(Well I think it is big)
We often configure many logical drives on a disk array controller.
Each of these are represented under Linux as a minor dev number.
We may have 50-70 logical drives on the system, each with 14 to 56 drives
each.
In order to balance the database load across all the spindles evenly, we
monitor # of reads/sec; # of writes/sec; min,max, and avg latency (service
time);
and avg # of outstanding I/O's (queue length) on a per logical drive basis.
If we find some drives overloaded and others lightly loaded we balance the
data.
Will we have the capabilities stated above? 
If not, is it very difficult to put these in the kernel at this point?
I would envision us supporting systems of this size on Linux next year on
the 2.4 kernel
and we really need this kind of data to tune the system...
Thanks,   Mike...

Agreed, I've implemented this and ripped the stats out of kstat. Patch
coming soon :-)
We do then loose the ability to tell when we've started a new request,
now we just account all buffers as a new request. Not a big deal, IMHO.
But do you just want per-queue stats, and not care about minors at all?

No big deal, for now I just have the proc code doing blk_get_queue for
every major. That code is hardly performance critical ;-)

Rigth, for IDE we'd get a per hwgroup stat. Sane for SCSI, too.
