I see this too, on a much faster system.  My browsing habit is to open a
link in a new tab, and immediately click on that tab.  The mouse gets
noticeably jumpy right after clicking the link.  I may be jaded by my
2.4.20-gentoo kernel which never did this, but still...
My system is a 2.4 GHz P4 running Gentoo, 2.6.0-test1 (tainted with
nVidia), and Mozilla Firebird, with a USB mouse.
