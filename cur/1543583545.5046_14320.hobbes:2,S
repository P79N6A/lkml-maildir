There would be no reason to BSD licence ReiserFS.. The intent of the BSD
licence is to let anyone who wants to lock it up with more restrictive
licences do so, and if the result is more popular.. take over control of the
software. 
So Hans could easily release a GPLed copy of FreeBSD with reiserfs. This
type of activity is encouraged by the BSD people.
