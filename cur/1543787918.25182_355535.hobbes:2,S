Indeed. I started work on a microkernel for a final year University
project. Didn't get very far beyond minimal memory management and a
vague handy-wavy concept of a process in the end as it's easy to get
unstuck figuring out random blackbox hardware. Makes you respect some
of these people who really figured it out for real and got it working.

It's easier now that we have a growing number of cheaper ARM/PPC
boards on the market. But in order to do much of this, you really need
a hardware debugger. In my case, I tried to do this on an Apple
powerbook but once you've broken the BAT/page mapping for your
framebuffer you're rapidly running out of ways of debugging, e.g. a
VM. It's difficult enough even with a UART, or an LED, or whatever.

A lot of people end up doing that - I've heard of some interesting
stories which I'm sure aren't widespread. One case, the guy had
basically bolted a small realtime module on to Linux (not really quite
like RTLinux) but had been able to do a lot of testing through
existing APIs. Another trick is to write as much as you can to sit
right atop the existing firmware - OpenFirmware, U-Boot, whatever and
perhaps even forgo trying to handle exceptions/VM for yourself in the
beginning.
