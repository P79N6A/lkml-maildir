At home:  rushlight logs for speaker-to-internet, but I could reverse this if
I started doing more development on rushlight.
At CMU:  hilfy (Solaris) logs for a number of machines already, including
Linux machines, as a stopgap until the logging system is delivered to me (if
they don't, I'll force all logging to some underutilized system...).  The pox 
here is the Ultrix boxes, which thankfully will all die at the end of the
year if not sooner :-)
