I've just reread Linus's notes about IPC filesystem and to me idea about
metafiles "above" usual root looks great: //proc for /proc, //dev for devfs
and so on. No need to mount in every chroot environment, not need to manual
mount anything at all, easy change of root: just umount //root and mount
other thing there. And POSIX agrees that //root or //proc CAN be special
so all is correct. So just kernel changes are needed. Right ? Not quite:

That is: in LOTS of current Linux systems some vital programs rely on fact
that currently "//"=="/". If we want EVER move to make "//" special IMHO
it's better to add kernel warning NOW. Perhaps configurable so it can be
disabled (not in compile time, but in run-time). This way at least EACH AND
EVERY Linux vendor will be aware about problem. What do you think ?
