Sure, we can do something like that. /dev/btrfs/ was just something
for me to start with, and see how the stuff works.

A low-level api will be offered by a future libblkid version in util-linux-ng.

The scan code is part of libblkid, we just need some explicit controls
to enable disable the scanning. It should never be the default, like
it is today.

It's also in libblkid. Today it's pretty useless to cache stuff
indexed by major/minor, but it's there.

A new libblkid already happened at:
  
http://git.kernel.org/?p=utils/util-linux-ng/util-linux-ng.git;a=shortlog;h=topic/blkid
Almost all of libvolume_id is already merged into this new version
(only btrfs is missing :)). Udev will switch over to calling blkid
when it's available in a released version of util-linux-ng. I will
just delete the current libvolume_id library after that.
No white smoke, if all works out as planned. :)
Thanks,
Kay
