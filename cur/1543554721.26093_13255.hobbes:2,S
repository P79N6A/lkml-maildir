The Athlon MCA is basically the same architecture-wise as Pentium Pro/II
But there are some differences..  Until AMD make document 21656 (BIOS
writers guide) public (or even a subset of it), we'll not be able to take
advantage of these extra features.
I'd suggest that until this happens, we leave bluesmoke.c Intel only.

Davej.
