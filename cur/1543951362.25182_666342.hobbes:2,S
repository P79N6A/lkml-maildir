Yes, I know. But the latter needs an extra line! Don't get me wrong, I am
not worrying about the result of `wc ...`, and I often add the blank lines
to improve the readability. But since the comment block itself adds the
"space", why should we lessen the number of the code lines visible to the
reader?
