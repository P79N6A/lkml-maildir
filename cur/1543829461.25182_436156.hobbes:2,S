sorry, I was just meaning that ARCH_PFN_OFFSET had been introduced to
solve this before your patch has been sent. So the requirement for
memory to start at pfn 0 is already solved.
Your patch solves the problem in a different way, but it's
incompatible with the current one (ARCH_PFN_OFFSET).
IMHO the question is now, which method is the best one ? If it's yours
the we probably need to get ride of the previous method and add yours
(but don't forget to modify arch such ARM which are currently using
ARCH_PFN_OFFSET).
