The correct fix is to apply __attribute__((packed)) to this structure.
Of course, changing the boot sector will cause different random values
to be poked into this field...
I actually caught this during my setup code rewrite, but I forgot that
in the old setup code the parameter structure overlays the boot sector
(it doesn't in my code -- it starts out with nice clean zero-filled memory.)
