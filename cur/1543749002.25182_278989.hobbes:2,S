The clock_id's are now passed through since you also have to pass your
bitmapped performance clocks through. I think this may also satisfy
George Anzinger's long standing request for the possibility of additional
clock support in glibc. The clocks are now defined only in the
kernel header files though.
Could you make the three clocks also available in glibc header files?
What do we do if additional clocks become available through the posix
layer in Linux?
