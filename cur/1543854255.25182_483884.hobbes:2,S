Interesting. Looks very much like eth1394's sysfs interface is getting
in the way. And since it is entirely handled by the ieee1394 core, it
means ieee1394 needs the class_dev to dev treatment. I think it's OK if
we just wait for Greg to finish his preliminary patch. Until then,
CONFIG_IEEE1394_ETH1394=n should avoid the oops. (Or Andrew marks
eth1394 broken or removes gregkh-driver-network-device.patch...)
Mattia, thanks for the many tests.
