I have a mini-distribution that runs from CD-ROM using H Peter Anvin's 
ISOLINUX/SYSLINUX boot loader.  While upgrading it to kernel 2.6, I have 
come across a behavioral difference between 2.4 and 2.6 that may impact 
other users of the 2.6 kernel.
With kernel 2.4, to boot an initial ramdisk, I would use the following 
arguments appended to the kernel :
linux24 ramdisk_size=32000 root=/dev/ram rw 
----
With kernel 2.6, the same arguments result in an error message.  Neither 
devfs nor udev are enabled, the distribution relies on pre-created /dev 
entries in the ramdisk.
However, the kernel will boot but -not- enter the ramdisk if root=/dev/ram.  
The entry has to be changed to root=/dev/ram0 in order for a successful boot.
Why has this change of behavior occured?
Martin B.
