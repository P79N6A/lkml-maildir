Another data-point for you. I have a dual P2/300 (Gigabyte motherboard
with an on-board Adaptec aic7895 SCSI adaptor) and an IBM 4.5GB SCSI hard
drive, model DDRS-34560W. Also is a very old Quantum TRB850A 850MB IDE
hard drive (it doesn't use DMA). I tried Larry's lmdd using 650MB, 100MB
and 75MB file sizes, both random access and the normal checking mode,
doing several operations simultaneously, on different partitions, disks
etc - everything I could think of. I didn't see any corruption.
This is with 2.2.10 SMP compiled on pgcc-2.91.66 (based on the egcs-1.1.2
release). I applied the following patch to drivers/scsi/sd.c (someone on
here mentioned it a while back):
--- drivers/scsi/sd.c.orig	Fri Jun 18 00:52:10 1999
+++ drivers/scsi/sd.c	Fri Jun 18 00:52:39 1999
