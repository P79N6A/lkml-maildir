Uhhuh. I think the old binary interface to "sys_getpriority()" was "20 -
nice", and the new code does "20 + nice". So the sign gets set wrong.
Try changing sys_getpriority() to say
	niceval = 20 - p->nice;
instead of
	niceval = p->nice + 20;
and we should be returning the same (fairly nonsensical, but they avoid
the error code return triggering) numbers we always used to.
