Did you ever take a look at that page?!  
I did. I´d say the best are the photos. The rest isn
´t much of a help. 
Ever since I grabbed me SuSE Linux 8.2 and managed to  
compile some standard kernel according to the 
loop-aes.readme it´s proven to the world: 
You do no longer need to study "Computer Science & 
Economics" to encrypt 200GB serial ata drives with 
128bit on AMD64 CPUs under linux. 
  
As there is no replacement for loop-aes to be found 
in the download section I´ll have to live with aes in 
its "weak" CBC implementation. 
Is there anyone out to think I´ll exchange 
AMD64-optimized, rock solid code & working software 
for dm-cryptoloop? 
 
In case there are more complaints concerning loop-aes 
everyone is free to launch either fixes or reveal 
urls with something better at hand. 
It should be: 
-easy to compile 
-rock solid in everyday usage 
-survive power losses & crashes (yes, I play UT2004 
from encrypted root + swap) 
-compatible with the future 
-third-party stand-alone software (not a kernel 
patch) 
-optimized for AMD64 CPU 
-well documented 
-bootable from removeable media 
(usb-hdd/SD-Cards/etc.) 
-able to move partition table from encrypted drive to 
removable medium 
 
I´m looking forward to read about your solutions!
