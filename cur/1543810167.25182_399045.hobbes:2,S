Hi,
LTTng currently uses some particular features from relayfs. I would like to make
sure that they will still be available.
* LTTng uses the "void *private" private data pointer extensively. It's very
  useful to pass a kernel client specific data structure to the client
  callbacks.
* LTTng does have its own ltt_poll and ltt_ioctl that are all what is needed to
  control the interaction with the file (along with the relayfs mmap/unmap).
In this scenario, the sysfs relay attribute creation would look like :
- create an empty attr
- fill some of attr members
- sysfs_create_relay_file(kobj, attr);
  (it will overwrite some attr members : kobj, rchan, rchan_buf)
  * set specific LTTng file operations on the inode
  * set the "private" field of the rchan structure.
The two operations marked with a * would need supplementary parameters to
sysfs_create_relay_file. Or is there something I missed ?
