Just because it can be done in the kernel, doesn't mean it should be.
In fact, the more that can be kept outside the kernel, the better.

It wouldn't need to be more complicated than a POSIX extended
attribute.

The Linux kernel is pretty stable, but tampering with internals in

So you are proposing the addition of a per-file attribute, with
restricted access, and potentially dangerous effects if set
incorrectly.  This, combined with the fact that is unlikely to receive
much testing, all speaks against it.
