I wrote some sysreq extensions that printk bucket counts for the hash
tables a while back.  Want me to dig them up?  (I since run my kernels
with hash tables 4x-16x as large -- not sure how much it helps, though.)  
I noticed what sct was talking about where when it hits swap, things tend
to all go into buckets close together -- I saw hundreds of things linked
to the same buckets at one point after I made my machine hit swap a bit.
I implemented inode, dentry, and page hash dumping, but I could stick in
buffers too.
