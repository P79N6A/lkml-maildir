If you mean having multiple IP addresses on the same NIC, sure you can do
that, see the section on DNAT in iptables. However, if you have multiple
NICs, you do not want to send a packet from one which has the IP of the
other, as your router is very likely to become confused and get its ARP
table in a twist.
You can force packets out one NIC or the other, usually using iproute, but
I don't think that's what you have in mind, is it? In any case, doable.
