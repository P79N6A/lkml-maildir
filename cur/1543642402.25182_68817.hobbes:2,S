The 2.4.19 kernels seem to be fine on the box unless it's right after
I've rebooted from 2.5.33.  Then 2.4.19 seems to be flakey in various
interesting ways until I do a full shut off of the hardware and turn
it back on.  Usually when I'm seeing problems under 2.4.19 they seem
to be vm errors in processes.  It really likes to kill off my
setiathome process with a vm error.  It's very consistant.  I run a
twenty minute cron job to restart setiathome and vm kills it almost
immediately.  Of course, I shut down the box and turn it off and when
it comes back up it runs fine until I restart under 2.5 again.  Then
five minutes or so and it's dead in the water again.
