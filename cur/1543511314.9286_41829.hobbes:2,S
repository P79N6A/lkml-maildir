Thanks for people jumping in to help.
All issues regarding my FC driver so far are resolved with:
1, changed SD_EXTRA_DEVS and rebuilt kernel,
2, Mknod with different major number
3, loading SMP driver successfully with "set version information" being
disabled using make menuconfig.
Now driver is testing under SMP environment (UP environemnt has been
tested).

Right, if your SCSI driver is loaded as a module
you can only see 4 SCSI disks because this is the
number of extra disk structs available after sd
installs. 
To get around this limitation, either:
a) Build your driver into the kernel, OR
b) If you want to keep your driver as a module,
change in usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi/hosts.h 
#define SD_EXTRA_DEVS 4
to
#define SD_EXTRA_DEVS <number you want>
and rebuild your kernel
