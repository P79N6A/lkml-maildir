Definitely.  As much as I appreciate the efforts to make a workable
end-user GUI for Linux, I think people are still going to have to get
used to using command-line tools at the moment.  For what it's worth,
there are two visual configuration options for the kernel; for a text
console, you can use "make menuconfig" while you can use "make xconfig"
if you're really into X.  Personally, I found the standard "make config"
useful only the first time around, because it forced me to look at every
option, but it's much easier to undo mistakes using menuconfig or xconfig.
