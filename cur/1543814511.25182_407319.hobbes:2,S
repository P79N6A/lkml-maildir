You mean typedef int bool...
That (or its derivative) is what at least 69 places in the kernel do 
already.  That is the whole point of discussion!  The point is to unify it 
all into a kernel common place.  I just suggested that using the compiler 
provided _Bool was better than using int.

Obviously.  No-one here is suggesting to use if (EXPR == TRUE) that is 
crazy.  You would use if (EXPR) no matter what type you use.  Technically 
only a boolean type should be used like that.  The fact it works for an 
int is concidence because false = 0 and true = 1.
The point is 1) when assigning, you assign x = FALSE; rather than x = 0; 
which means nothing (it could be a counter you are initializing, no way to 
tell) and 2) for return values from functions and parameters to functions 
so it is easier to understand the semantics of the function.
