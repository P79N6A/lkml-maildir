While looking around for other examples, I ran across
cpufreq/affected_cpus.  Shouldn't cpufreq.c:show_affected_cpus() be
using cpumask_scnprintf instead of "%u"?
But anyway...
It seems to me that this could be confusing for a lot of people who are
casually browsing through sysfs.  Why not name core_siblings something
like core_sibling_bitmap?  Using _units isn't unprecedented, we have
read_ahead_kb.  I think it's nice not having to look it up to know
read_ahead is in kb and not bytes or sectors.  Likewise, it'd be nice to
know it's a bitmap and not a count just by looking at the name.
More alternatively, bitmaps seem ugly.  Why not one of these options
instead?
- a space separated list of bitmap offsets: "0 1" instead of 3
- a directory of symlinks to devices/system/cpu/cpu[N]:
   devices/system/cpu/cpu1/topology/core_siblings/0 -> ../../../cpu0
   devices/system/cpu/cpu1/topology/core_siblings/1 -> ../../../cpu1
