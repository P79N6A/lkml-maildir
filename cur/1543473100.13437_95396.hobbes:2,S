The sanest explanation for this problem (I've hit it too) I have
heard is: The the ICMP message that is supposed to go back to
the sender to tell it that it's TU is too big is blocked or lost
during the IP Masquerading code.
For the record, I set my ethernet MTU to 552, the same as my PPP, and
that
seemed to fix things.
Now that I feel a littler braver about kernel hacking, I may try to
track
this problem down and try to squash it.
