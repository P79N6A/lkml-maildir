Hi, 
 Can someone explain me what should be the stack layout and register
value( if there is any restriction ) before calling ret_from_syscall for
Alpha. Again in entry.S i find may places where  we make current (
Register 8) as below 
  lda     $8,0x3fff
  bic     $30,$8,$8
If someone can expain what happens in the above two assembly statement
it will be really helpful.
Thanks in advance.
