Like with the previous patch from Eric, I'm CC'ing the correct people
for this patch (forwarded it in a seperate email). CC'ing irrelevant
lists such as containers@ and not linux-ia64@ makes it somewhat
difficult to get proper reviews of these things.
Russ/Dean/Robin - could one of you provide some feedback to this one
please.
Thanks,
Jes
