You've got to take MODULE_LICENSE() into account. There is
	MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
	MODULE_LICENSE("GPL v2");
	MODULE_LICENSE("GPL and additional rights");
	MODULE_LICENSE("Dual BSD/GPL");
	MODULE_LICENSE("Dual MIT/GPL");
	MODULE_LICENSE("Dual MPL/GPL");
I think it's time to set things right, making
	* MODULE_LICENSE the authoritative place for the license
	  (also makes it easier to grep for)
	* sync up license into MODULE_LICENSE
