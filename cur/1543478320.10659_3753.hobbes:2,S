	What overhead is associated with pointers in C? Or preprocessor,
for that matter? And if you hope to avoid pointers in the kernel - write
on FOCAL from the very beginning. Ditto for preprocessor. You *do*
recommend to avoid large chunks of C++. Sorry, if the language has such,
erm, dark corners - IMO it's not for big projects.
