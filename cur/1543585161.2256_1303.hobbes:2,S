The simple 'fix' is to move the offending kmalloc() up above the cli(). 
That might actually be something else to make an automated test for - 
anything which schedules can re-enable interrupts. In general, it's bad to 
call anything which can schedule when interrupts are disabled.
But actually, the cli() is there because of the fundamentally flawed 
assumption that it provides sufficient locking. I've converted the whole 
thing to use spinlocks instead, but haven't got a test setup ATM. I'll 
poke at it more on Monday.
akpm, were you looking at this?
