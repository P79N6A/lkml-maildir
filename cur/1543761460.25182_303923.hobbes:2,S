Probably the best thing would be to wait and see what happens
with the ptwalk patches. There is a fix in there for ia64 now,
but I think that may be a temporary one.
Andi is probably keeping an eye on that, but if not then I
could put a patchset together when things finalise in 2.6.
 From the profiles I have seen, the ptwalk patches bring page
table walking performance pretty well back to 2.6.10 levels,
however the "aggressive page table freeing" (clear_page_range)
changes that went in at the same time as the 4level stuff
seem to be what is slowing down exit() and unmapping performance.
Not by a huge amount, mind you, and it is not completely wasted
performance, because it provides better page table freeing.
But it is enough to be annoying! I haven't had much time to look
at it lately, but I hope to get onto it soon.
