It was a poor wording by me. It refers to the drift of naming due to
increments in usb_host_id. After a disconnect and reconnect, /dev/uba1
refers to the device, but /proc/partitions says "ubb".
To correct this, I have to set gendisk->fist_minor before calling
add_disk(), but in order to do that, a driver has to track devices
somehow. A serial number looks like an obvious candidate for a key.
