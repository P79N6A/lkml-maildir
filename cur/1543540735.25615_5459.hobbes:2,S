Hi,
I have tried to deploy an B011 ISA 2 channel IDE cotroller in my Q40.
Unfortunatley the device has an own BIOS which apparently has to do
some *magic* to enable the IDE ports. The card has plenty of jumpers
and serial and paralel ports work so it is not a P&P problem.
I have tried to read out and disassemble the BIOS but get nothing
but garbage - are there any issues when disassembling BIOSes with 
objdump?
Did anyone succeed to make a similar controller work on non-x86? 
Any pointers to BIOS emulators or similar?
Bye
Richard
