First, let me thank you a LLLOOOOOOTTTTT, David, for you PCI 64 bit
addressing DMA-mapping. I didn't have looked yet into your patch and
documentation update, but I will do so ASAP.
OTOH, it is a great pleasure for me to hear that you didn't forget what I
told you about the current limitation of the SYM53C8XX driver. For now,
the driver would be only able to use 40 bit addresses with all upper bits
set to zero. This doesn't fit PCI 64 bit implementation of the Alpha
Monster window for example, and probably doesn't fit most other non-Intel
PCI 64 bit implementations.
But there is an alternate solution for the SYM53C8XX driver by using up to
16 x 32 bit segment registers. This would (will) allow to address for DMA
16 x 4GB segments with all upper bits being settable for each 4GB segment.
I have this in my todo-list since months, but haven't had strong reasons
for implementing it. The strongest reasons would be that I had access to
64 bit machines with 64 bit PCI, but this isn't possible. My machine uses
a Supermicro 370 DLE Mobo that offers PCI 64 bit path, but I only have 256
MB of memory. :-(, and anyway, the thing looks like a 15 years old 32 bit
Intel-arch :-(, that doesn't support 64 bit PCI addressing. :-(
