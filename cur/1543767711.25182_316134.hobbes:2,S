A couple of days ago, Matt Mackall described/proposed a tool to
check new patches for acceptable content and format:
http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/kernel-mentors/2005-May/000072.html
I'm attaching a rudimentary version of such a tool (check-patch.pl).
It does not attempt to check for line wrapping or lines that are
> 80 characters.
It dislikes patches that contain attachments that are base64,
quoted-printable, or binary (e.g.).
People can run this script locally, but ideally We (royal) will
have an email address for it so that people can use it to check
if their mail interface munges the patch for them... :(
and can try again until it doesn't.
Yeah, it's not perfect and it's a bit verbose.
Patches accepted (or even complete rewrites :).
