Andrea, one thing I don't think we have discussed before is that aside
from mapping into shmfs or hugetlbfs, there is also the regular shmem
segment (shmget) we always use. the way we currently allocate memory is
like this :
just a big shmem segment w/ shmget() up to like 1.7 or 2.5 gb,
containing the entire in memory part
or 
shm (reasoanble sized segment, between 400mb and today on 32bit up to
like 1.7 - 2 gb) which is used for non buffercache (sqlcache, parse
trees etc)
a default of about 16000 mmaps into the shmfs file (or
remap_file_pages) and the total size ranging from a few gb to many gb
	which contains the data buffer cache
we cannot put the sqlcache(shared pool) into shmfs and do the windowing
and this is a big deal for performance as well. eg the larger the
better. it would have to be able to get to a reasonable size, and you
have about 512mb on top of that for the window into shmfs. average sizes
range between 1gb and 1.7gb so a 2/2 split would not be useful here. 
sql/plsql/java cache is quite important for certain things. 
I think Van is running a test on a32gb box to compare the 2 but I think
that would be too limiting in general to have only 2gb.
