Steve, thanks for these patches. I got it to compile with 2.6.14-rc3-rt12
but had to change the assembly lines in (patched) latency.c to
__asm__ __volatile__("and %%rsp,%0" :
 				"=r" (stack_left) : "0" (THREAD_SIZE - 1));
ie. `and' instead of `andl' and `%%rsp' instead of `%%esp'.
Somebody who understands x86_64 assembly better than I do should probably check 
this before anyone tries using it.
While I was at it I changed a printk arg in line 335 of (patched) latency.c - 
I think the last %d should be %ld, ie. 
printk("| new stack-footprint maximum: %s/%d, %ld bytes (out of %ld bytes).\n",
	worst_stack_comm, worst_stack_pid, MAX_STACK-worst_stack_left, MAX_STACK);
