How did I know that you would mention mips and the like :-)
Yeah, mips has the crazy Load Linked and Store Conditional crap, so it
is a little more complex than the simple add one.  And I think PPC does
too, although it has been a while since I've used them.  And older mips
don't have the LL SC command so the only option is to turn off
interrupts (of course those that don't have the LL and SC are not SMP
compatible).  So, I will admit that having a smp_atomic_inc might be
nice. I was just being a narrow minded x86 hacker ;-)

Yeah, that on PREEMP_RT would not turn off interrupts but just stops
preemption. This is fine as long as the mylock is not used in any
SA_NODELAY interrupt.
