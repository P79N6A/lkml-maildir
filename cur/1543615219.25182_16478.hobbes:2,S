Perhaps it would help if the entries in Configure.help were sorted?
It's very difficult to merge anything in that file, since in many cases the
`new' entries added by the new patch, already existed in our local tree
(speaking about m68k). Someone just wrote new explanations, and inserted them
someplace else in the file.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
