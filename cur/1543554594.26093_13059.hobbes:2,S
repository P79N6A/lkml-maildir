Please err on the conservative side -- IMHO you shouldn't mark a driver
as hotpluggable (by using the '__dev' prefix) unless you know it is
necessary.
Otherwise, you rob CONFIG_HOTPLUG people of some memory that could
otherwise be freed at boot.  And the number of CONFIG_HOTPLUG people is
not small, it includes not only the CardBus users but USB users too...
