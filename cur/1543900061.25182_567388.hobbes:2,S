Well it's a bit far fetched to suspect the setup code, but I have another 
i440 that suspends-to-ram when booted over pxe without any problems.  And, 
booting the i810 through dos-lilo also hangs STR, so that's why assumed it 
may be a setup code thing.

How can I pull a tar-ball from that without using a git client?
Thanks!
