There's a lot of macros related to sector sizes in ide-cd.h. I suppose
all that would need to be changed to depend on the real hardware sector
size?
I don't have any idea about block layer internals or about sending
commands to a drive.
In fact, I don't even know how to start or what uses of sector size
in ide-cd.c really need to be changed. Much less do I know where
information about hardware sector size could be gotten and how it should
be stored for use by ide-cd.
