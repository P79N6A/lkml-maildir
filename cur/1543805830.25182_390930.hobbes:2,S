What exactly is the unsolvable problem with doing this in userspace?

If an attacker has enough privileges for attacking the daemon, he should 
usually also have enough privileges for attacking the kernel.
The number of different attacks might be lower, but you haven't 
completely solved any problem.

Checking signatures on modules sounds like a job for module-init-tools
(if there's any real benefit in signing GPL'ed modules).
