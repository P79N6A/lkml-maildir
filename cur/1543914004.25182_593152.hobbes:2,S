Subject: [PATCH] Configurable tap interface MTU

This patch makes it possible to change the MTU on a tap interface.
Increasing the MTU beyond the 1500-byte default is useful for
applications that interoperate with Ethernet devices supporting jumbo
frames.
The patch caps the MTU somewhat arbitrarily at 16000 bytes. This is
slightly lower than the value used by the e1000 driver, so it seems
like a safe upper limit.
