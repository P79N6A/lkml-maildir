not at all different model. 90% of the important drivers (no,
drivers/s390 doesnt count) are shared between multiple architectures
using the same interface: request_irq()/free_irq() and a handler with an
enumerated irq vector.

it could be a bit like nommu - a noirq model.
i agree with enabling an architecture to exclude _all_ of hardirq.c, but 
specifying per-function is excessive - if an architecture can make use 
of some of them then weak symbols will get rid of the rest.
