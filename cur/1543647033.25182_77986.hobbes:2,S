Umm, that's why we have quota..

a) if the HSM/whatever is so standalone that it should patch ext2 code
   it is truely generic and thus above the filesystem.
b) you don;t even export the register/unregister to modules, not mention
   other ext2/ext3 core functionality that it would need.
c) looks at the 'would'  there is no such code currently and if it gets
   a real consern it still could be added.  Don't bloat the kernel
   more than you really need to..
