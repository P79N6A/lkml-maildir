We (Mandrake) have done so - our 6.0 distribution (to be released probably
Friday) includes several ISDN fixes (mostly from current i4l CVS).
It might not be perfect, but it's definately better with ISDN than current
stock kernels.
You can download our source RPM at
ftp://sunsite.uio.no/pub/linux/mariner/SRPMS
and all other mirrors (list at 
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/mariner
).
