Paul M, David R, others -- how does this look?
From: Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>
Update the per-task cpus_allowed of each task in a cgroup
whenever it has a cpuset whose 'cpus' mask changes.
The change to basing cpusets on the cgroup (aka container)
infrastructure broke an essential cpuset hack.  The old cpuset
code had used the act of reattaching a task to its own cpuset
(writing its pid back into the same 'tasks' file it was already
in) to trigger the code that updates the cpus_allowed cpumask
in the task struct to the cpus_allowed cpumask dictated by that
tasks cpuset.
This was a hack to avoid having code in the main scheduler
code path that checked for changes in the cpus_allowed by each
tasks cpuset, which would have unacceptable performance impact
on the scheduler.
The cgroup code avoids calling the update callout if a task
is reattached to the cgroup it is already attached to do.
This turned reattaching a task to its own cpuset into a no-op,
making it impossible to change a tasks CPU placement by changing
the cpus_allowed of the cpuset containing that task.
The right thing to do would be to have the code that updates a
cpusets cpus_allowed walk through each task currently in that
cpuset and update the cpus_allowed in that tasks task_struct.
This change does that, adding code called from cpuset
update_cpumask() that updates the task_struct cpus_allowed of
each task in a cgroup whenever it has a cpuset whose 'cpus'
is changed.

-If a cpuset has its CPUs modified, then each task using that

-are rebound to their cpuset, by rewriting their pid to the 'tasks'

-is still allowed in its new cpuset settings, then the task will be
-restricted to the intersection of the CPUs it was allowed on before,
-and its new cpuset CPU placement.  If, on the other hand, there is
-no overlap between a tasks prior placement and its new cpuset CPU
-placement, then the task will be allowed to run on any CPU allowed
-in its new cpuset.  If a task is moved from one cpuset to another,
-its CPU placement is updated in the same way as if the tasks pid is
-rewritten to the 'tasks' file of its current cpuset.
+If a cpuset has its 'cpus' modified, then each task in that cpuset

+allowed to run on any CPU allowed in its new cpuset, negating the
+affect of the prior sched_setaffinity() call.
 
 In summary, the memory placement of a task whose cpuset is changed is
 updated by the kernel, on the next allocation of a page for that task,
