This kind of thing is exactly what has been avoided by using
interactivity boosts, and taking that into account in an "io-nice" value
as well should solve that. Other profiles might be interesting though.
Interactive tasks have a tendency to be interactive for a short while,
and then be noninteractive for a long time. I'm thinking that it might
be worthwhile to do something with that, i.e. to keep a bonus for "past
interactivity" on some pages based on the fact that they were originally
loaded by a still-existing process that was once/is marked as
interactive.
