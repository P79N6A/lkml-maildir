In my experience the most critical issues running 16K processes are:
(1) the highmem footprint of the pte's is significant
(2) the lowmem footprint of pmd's
and most of the rest is in the noise. It's probably a bad idea to run
top(1) or perhaps even mount /proc/ at all until top itself,
proc_pid_readdir(), and the tasklist_lock are all fixed.
Pretty much all he needs to "stay alive" is highpte of some flavor or
another. Performance etc. is addressed somewhat more by 2.5.x than -aa,
at least in the context of not degrading with this kind of multitasking.
i.e. shpte and pidhash. I've been randomly shooting down do_each_thread()
and for_each_process() loops in -wli, which is why I recommended it.
