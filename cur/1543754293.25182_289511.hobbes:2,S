incremented h_buffer_credits will be subtracted from incremented
t_outstanding_credits in journal_stop(). so, there is no imbalance
at this point. 
then, if (b_tcount == 0) we can correct t_outstanind_credits or
h_buffer_credits. wrong?
let's try another way ... we have two processes: P1 and P2. they
access block B.
the code is:
    if (credits != 0) {
       handle->h_buffer_credits++;
       transaction->t_outstanding_credits++;
    }
    if (jh->b_tcount == 0)
       transcation->t_outstanding_credits--;
case 1:
     P1 accesses B (*credits=1)
     P1 releases B
        (credits != 0) h1->h_buffer_credits++;
        (credits != 0) transaction->t_outstanding_credits++;
        (b_tcount == 0) transaction->t_outstanding_credits--;
    OUTPUT: transaction->t_outstanding_credits -= 1
case 2:
     P1 accesses B (*credits=1)
     P2 accesses B (*credits=0)
     P1 releases B
     P2 modifies B
        (credits != 0) h1->h_buffer_credits++;
        (credits != 0) transaction->t_outstainding_credits++;
        (b_tcount != 0)
     OUTPUT: journal_stop() will subtract incremented h_buffer_credits
             from incremented t_outstading_credits => no changes
case 3:
     P1 accesses B (*credits=1)
     P2 accesses B (*credits=0)
     P2 releases B
     P1 modifies B
        (credits != 0)
        (credits != 0)
        (b_tcount == 0)
     OUTPUT: no changes        
case 4:
     P1 accesses B (*credits=1)
     P2 accesses B (*credits=0)
     P2 releases B
     P1 releases B
        (credits != 0) 
        (credits != 0)
        (b_tcount == 0)
        (credits != 0) h1->h_buffer_credits++;
        (credits != 0) transaction->t_outstanding_credits++;
        (b_tcount == 0) transaction->t_outstanding_credits--;
     OUTPUT: P2 will change nothing, P1 will drop the buffer and
             correct t_outstanding_credits
case 5:
     P1 accesses B (*credits=1)
     P2 accesses B (*credits=0)
     P1 releases B
     P2 releases B
        (credits != 0) h1->h_buffer_credits++;
        (credits != 0) transaction->t_outstanding_credits++;
        (b_tcount == 0)
        (credits != 0)
        (credits != 0)
        (b_tcount == 0) transaction->t_outstanding_credits--;
     OUTPUT: P1 will change own credits, P2 will drop the buffer
             and correct t_outstanding_credits
thanks, Alex
