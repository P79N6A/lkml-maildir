Hi Arnaldo,
Yes it's possible with ftrace, by using the function graph tracer ( an
ftrace extension that adds the tracing on return).
To enable it just do:
echo function_graph > /debugfs/tracing/current_tracer
And to trace by choosing a particular function as the root of the call
stack, just do the things
 explained on this patch:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched-devel.git;a=commit;h=ea4e2bc4d9f7370e57a343ccb5e7c0ad3222ec3c
And the tracing will finish after this function returns :-)
