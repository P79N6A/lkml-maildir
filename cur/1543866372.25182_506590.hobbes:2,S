Subject: [GIT PULL] ieee1394 updates post 2.6.20
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/8/219

Linus, please pull from the for-linus branch at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ieee1394/linux1394-2.6.git for-linus
to receive IEEE 1394 subsystem updates as listed further below.
The upshot:
  - another bit to get suspend/resume going (bug 7072)
  - fix video1394 on systems with IO bounce buffers, i.e. typically
    on EMT64 with more than ca. 3GB RAM
  - fix old issues with PCCard ejection while dv1394 is loaded (bug
    7121) and LLD unloading while raw1394 is in use (bug 7701)
  - fix a regression in 2.6.20-rc1 in nodemgr (bug 7942, -stable will
    get their share)
  - remove some fat (people who want to have OUIs translated to
    company names can use the ls1394 script)
The patches have been written in December and January and have been in
-mm soon after they were submitted --- except for the three fixes in
video1394, raw1394, and nodemgr which are fresh from February but are
duly tested.
