I hate to disappoint you, but I've been working as a professional
programmer for the last 22 years, since before the IBM PC was even
released, and I have *NEVER* heard the PC character set referred to as
ASCII by anybody. IBM always refer to it as "IBM Character Set #2" and
even Microsoft always referred to it as "the PC Character Set" prior
to their introduction of code pages.

To ANY serious programmer, ASCII has only ever had one meaning, which
is the ANSI X3.4 standard published in 1968, long before the IBM PC
reared its head. For details, refer to...
