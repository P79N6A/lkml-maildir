The 'case' block are, however, _within_ the switch, thus they need to be
indented - just my 2 cents. But OK ...

Didn't know. Is there any documentation on this _really_ helpful mechanism?

OK, so why is _any_

		get_lost;
stuff left there without the braces? I guess one day there _could_ another
line to lead to 
	if (1) {
		beat_it;
		get_lost;
	}
where the braces are definitely missing. You could also have pinned the return
there when it was needed. And for now it's definitely not. Maybe for readability.
But that's another thing...

.. to be discussed right here. You're snippet is not _more readable_ due to the
return. Any when it comes to such things as 'return the rc right now as we're
setup and ready' I could point out some other locations where the rc is set, the
code did its setup for ie. a device and many if-statements follow but no change
to rc is made. Why not use 'immediate return' there?
Maybe on could clarify for me.

I did understand the fact that one line-breaks the function declaration. But I
don't understand the need to put a blank line where someday a var could
defined.
I could put another 60 blank lines somewhere just in case some vendor brings any
device that needs some special treatment on init or something.

It was just an example. To me it looks like some sorta 'this is my code and you
please let your finger off it'-thing. I do understand that whitespace/indenting-only
patches are just about to get us in trouble when it comes to other patches
applied to the tree as ie. Andi Kleen stated in 'Re: [PATCH] early_printk:
cleanup trailiing whitespace' today.
The remove-return-thing, however, was not a whitespace thing. I still disagree
it makes the code more readable or whatever. It's just redundant as this time.
When there's a need, we could add it.

OK, let's face it: I don't have any FireWire hardware around. Not even a cable.
So I'm not gonna do anyting there.
I just stumbled upon the ub.c code on my way to get my USB chipcard reader module
from crashing when it's unloaded. The patch just exists because I read the file
and wondered what all these comments should 'comment' if now comment was
actually in there.

Could you point me to some location?
