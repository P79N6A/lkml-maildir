Hmm. Okay, I'd better confess. It parses /proc/cpuinfo... except there's
no information there about the NR_CPUS used for cpumask_t, but rather
only num_cpus_online().
akpm, apps are in trouble. Some interface is needed to export NR_CPUS
so the kernel doesn't clobber their memory if they guess too low. Andi,
how does libnuma cope with this?
