After a long session of heavy use I triggered the BUG at inode.c line
372 in clear_inode:
        if (inode->i_data.nrpages)
               
BUG();                                                                                                                        
This occured when a gdb xterm was attempting to close.  Unfortunately I
wasn't able to translate or capture the oops.  I'll do some heavy
beating on 24-pre again tomorrow on my test machine and see if can
capture this oops over serial.
This call most likely came from invalidate_inodes.  It looks like some
pages have escaped cleanup.
