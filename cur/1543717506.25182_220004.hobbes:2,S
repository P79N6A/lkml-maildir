You can't scale a prescott, you can only throttle it.

The cpu MHz entry in /proc/cpuinfo is the same for all CPUs, and no reliable
source to detect the current cpu frequency anyway. Use
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/scaling_cur_freq or even cpuinfo_cur_freq for
that.[*] So p4-clockmod-throttling does work on your p4 prescott.

[*] Available in 2.6.7, hopefully, if Linus merges the latest cpufreq-bk
tree from Dave. It'll be in the next -mm release, though.
