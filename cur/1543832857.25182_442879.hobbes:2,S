Subject: [PATCH 0/4] stack overflow safe kdump (2.6.18-rc1-i386) try#2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
I tried to incorporate all the ideas received after the previous post
(thank you!). In particular I hope the new code is handling the Voyager
case properly.
---
This is a the first of a series of patch-sets aiming at making kdump
more robust against stack overflows.
This patch set does the following:
* Add safe_smp_processor_id function to i386 architecture (this function
was inspired by the x86_64 function of the same name).
* Substitute "smp_processor_id" with the stack overflow-safe
"safe_smp_processor_id" in the reboot path to the second kernel.
List of patches (the last two should be applied in the order of
appearance):
[1/4] safe_smp_processor_id: stack overflow safe implementation of
smp_processor_id.
[2/4] safe_smp_processor_id_voyager: stack overflow safe implementation
of smp_processor_id for i386-voyager.
[3/4] crash_use_safe_smp_processor_id: replace smp_processor_id with
safe_smp_processor_id in "arch/i386/kernel/crash.c".
[4/4] safe_smp_send_nmi_allbutself: re-implement smp_send_nmi_allbutself
so that calls to smp_processor_id (through send_IPI_allbutself) can be
replaced with safe_smp_processor_id without affecting other parts of the
kernel (as suggested by Eric Biederman).
I am looking forward to your comments and suggestions.
Regards,
Fernando
