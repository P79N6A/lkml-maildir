Hello,
I've seen some old posts (+yr) about this, with no conclusion, and I've 
seen that the changelogs on the latest(s) -18pre and development pre have 
addressed tape bug fixes and SCSI (including ide-scsi).
I'm having problems with a Seagate ATAPI STT220000A Travan Tapestor unit.
Has anyone had problems with that model at 2.4.17? Have these issues been 
addressed specifically on these latest -pres? 
I have the modules st, ide-scsi, scsi_mod, sg loaded.
Problems:
1. The diagnostic program from Seagate (and their technical support) say 
the unit is bad and need replacement):
zu /root/backup_scripts # diagsvlx rwtest -id:0
 Checking System Configuration.

 Test failed due to excessive errors.
 Retry the test with a different tape and/or clean the drive.
 Issued Final Cmd: Rewind Tape.
..although I can write/read anything without errors.
2. Although I can read/write without data corruption, /var/log/messages 
says:

sense key Illegal Request
Feb 21 09:10:14 zulu kernel: Additional sense indicates Invalid command 
operation code
Do I really need a new tape drive unit, or is this "normal" with 2.4.17?
Thanks,
Joao
