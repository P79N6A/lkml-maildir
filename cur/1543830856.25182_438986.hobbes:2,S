I am sort of against the unconditional trigger of the ethernet-specific stuff,
dependless if UCC eth is really wanted in specific configuration.
For stuff like that I'd make a function (to setup low-level stuff), and pass it 
via platform_info to the eth driver, so that really driver-specific things happen in driver context only.
Yes this is board specific file, and virtually everything needed for the board can take place here. 
But usually BCSR acts as a toggle for a several things, and IOW, I see it more correct to trigger those stuff from the respective drivers (using a callback passed through platform_info)
