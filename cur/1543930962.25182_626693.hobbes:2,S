Commit 2e0fef85e098f6794956b8b80b111179fbb4cbb7 added the folowing code 
to drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_attr.c that was most likely not intended to be 
dead code:
<--  snip  -->
...
lpfc_state_show(struct class_device *cdev, char *buf)
{
...
                switch (vport->port_state) {
                        len += snprintf(buf + len, PAGE_SIZE-len,
                                        "initializing\n");
                        break;
...
<--  snip  -->
Spotted by the GNU C compiler version 3.3.

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
