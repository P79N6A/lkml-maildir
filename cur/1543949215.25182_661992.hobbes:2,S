Just coming back from hollidays, sorry for the delay.
I can provide a patch so that L1_CACHE_BYTES is not anymore a compile time 
constant if you want, but I am not sure it is worth the trouble ? (and this 
certainly not 2.6.{24|25} stuff :) )
Current situation :
L1_CACHE_BYTES is known at compile time, and can be quite large (128 bytes), 
while cache_line_size() gives the real cache line size selected at boot time 
given the hardware capabilities.
If L1_CACHE_BYTES is not anymore a constant, compiler will also uses plain 
divides to compute L1_CACHE_ALIGN()
Maybe uses of L1_CACHE_ALIGN() in fastpath would 'force' us to not only 
declare a cache_line_size() but also a cache_line_size_{mask|shift}() so that 
x86 could use :
#define L1_CACHE_ALIGN(x) ((((x)+cache_line_mask())) >> cache_line_shift())
#define L1_CACHE_BYTES (cache_line_size())
But I am not sure we want to play these games (we must also make sure nothing 
in the tree wants a constant L1_CACHE_BYTES and replace by SMP_CACHE_BYTES)
