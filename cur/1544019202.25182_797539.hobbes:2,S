Interesting.  This seems like a bug in seq_file plain and simple.
Userspace appears to be acting very reasonable in this case.
Why is there a notion that we have to differentiate between read
and pread in seq_file to fix this.  That doesn't make much sense.
Anyway here is an untested but logically correct patch which should fix
this issue, without nasty special casing of pread.
