- If named namespaces are to be implemented, you could check for a set
  namespace ID. (You could also get rid of the persistent-namespace-daemon.)
- If secure user mounts are implemented, missing privileges will be hint.
  Privileged mounts will require a global configuration where a flag can
  be set. (BTW: You'll also want to disable user mounts in global namespaces
  to catch errors, abuse and exploits)
- Until any of these is implemented, users will run in a private namespace,
  so UID != EUID will indicate a private namespace. Unfortunately this is
  not secure, but:
- If the proc/mounts information is extended as described below, a different
  behaviour wouldn't make sense anymore, would it?

- The file format is broken for whitespace in filenames, so changing the
  format in these cases by adding quoting won't actually break anything.
- The userspace options (loop device etc) can be encoded in the mount
  options field, e.g.
  'rw,mount=lo:"/home/Arthur Dent/iso":/dev/loop/42;ns=public,async'.
So if you _want_ to keep the format, you can IMHO do so. Maybe you can
think of something better, who knows? We'll need to upgrade the tools
to use non-broken semantics anyway, so as long as you keep the old file
around, this should be no real problem.
