Are you sure the trace is decoded correctly?
> CPU:    0 
> EIP:    0010:[sys_mremap+31/884] 
> EFLAGS: 00010206
> Code: ac ae 75 08 84 c0 75 f8 31 c0 eb 04 19 c0 0c 01 85 c0 75 d9
ac ae is
lodsb
scasb
Could you run
#objdump --disassemble-all --reloc linux/mm/mremap.o | less
and check that the code is really at offset 31 of sys_mremap?
And is it correct that only 64 MB memory is installed/enabled?
