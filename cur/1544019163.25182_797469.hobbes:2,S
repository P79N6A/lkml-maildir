Er, oops.  Sorry about that.  Yeah, I habitually do 'make distclean' as 
part of my kclean and kbuild standard workflow scripts.
I also habitually _avoid_ "git commit -a", so I am surprised that I 
actually made this mistake.  I am 100% certain that I issued neither 
"git rm" nor "git update-index" commands on that file.
Granted, I should have been more careful, but I am also surprised this 
happened at all.
