	Have you looked at Class-Based Kernel Resource Managment (CKRM)
(
http://ckrm.sf.net
) to see if it fits your needs? My initial thought is
that the CKRM numtasks controller may help limit forks in the way you
describe.
	If you have any questions about it please join the CKRM-Tech mailing
list (ckrm-tech@lists.sourceforge.net) or chat with folks on the OFTC
IRC #ckrm channel.
Cheers,
