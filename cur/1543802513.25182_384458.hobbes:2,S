	It's worth noting that a few tests in the current Open Posix Test Suite
hang RT systems. 
Specifically this test (hope this url comes through),
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/
*checkout*/posixtest/posixtestsuite/conformance/interfaces/sched_setparam/10-1.c?rev=1.2
sched_setparam test 10-1.c and I think 9-1.c .
The 10-1 test spawns some children at SCHED_FIFO priority 99 , then runs
the following,
void child_process(){
	alarm(2);
	while(1) {
		(*shmptr)++;
		sched_yield();
	}
}
I'm sure this is what's hanging the system, the yield() is one issue.
Another is why the alarm() is never delivered .
