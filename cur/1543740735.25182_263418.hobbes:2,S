Subject: [PATCH] Shift key-related error codes up and insert ECANCELED
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch shifts the key-related error codes up by one and inserts an
ECANCELED error code where not already defined. It seems that has been defined
in glibc without passing it back to the kernel:-/
Who arbitrates error number allocations anyway?
