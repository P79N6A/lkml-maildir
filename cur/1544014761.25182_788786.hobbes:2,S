Subject: [PATCH 3/4] hvc_console: free_irq only if request_irq was successful

Only call free_irq if we marked the request_irq has having succeeded
instead of whenever the the sub-driver identified the interrupt to use.

Appears to be a bugfix but might use a bit of time in -next.
This code was created in 2.6.28 to allow s390 to build without adding ifdefs.
Many hvc-console sub-drivers have a single channel and are not modules.
