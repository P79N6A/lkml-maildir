From time to time I get asked about remote GDB support for kernel
versions 2.2.x.  Well, here it is.  Download
ftp://ftp.gcom.com/pub/linux/src/kgdb-2.2.6/kgdb-2.2.6.tgz
 and install
it. As you might infer from the file name, I tested it on kernel version
2.2.6.  I have submitted this one to Linus for inclusion in the kernel
source -- the other, non-Intel, architectures have such a feature
already.  Thanks to Tigran Aivazian <tigran"at"sco.COM> for recasting
the patch into a selection item on the menuconfig "Kernel Hacking" menu.
