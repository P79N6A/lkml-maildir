Your vision is quite selective, then.

... which is more than enough to veto it.  However, that is not all.
Consider the following scenario:
1) gcc gives false positive
2) tosser on a rampage "fixes" it
3) code is chaged a month later
4) a real bug is introduced - one that would be _really_ visible to gcc,
with "is used" in a warning
5) thanks to aforementioned tosser, that bug remains hidden.
And that's besides making code uglier for no good reason, etc.
Consider that preemptively NAKed.
