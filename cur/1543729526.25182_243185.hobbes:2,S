Shawn and Cyrille, can you try the attached patch, please?  We were using
__initdata from a function that is no longer used only at boot-time.
I'm pretty sure this will fix Shawn's problem.  I don't know whether
it'll fix yours, Cyrille, but it might.
Andrew, I think this is clearly a bug independent of my other patches
in -mm, so could you apply this as well?
Make acpi_irq_penalty non-initdata, since it's used by the
non_init acpi_pci_link_allocate().  And make acpi_irq_penalty_init()
__init, since it is used only by the __init pci_acpi_init().
