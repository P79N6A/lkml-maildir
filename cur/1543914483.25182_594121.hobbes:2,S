That "current_cred" thing is really too ugly to live.
Why is it trying to make it look like a variable? That will just confuse 
people, and/or make them think it's a cheap thing rather than some complex 
function call.
Also, why does the "__current_cred()" function have those illogical and 
insane "#ifdef CONFIG_KEYS" things in it, when it cannot be used/work 
sanely without it (and when the header file does a
	+#ifndef CONFIG_KEYS
	+#define __current_cred()       ({ current->cred; })
	+#else
	..
anyway?)
IOW, this patch should be taken out and shot, for apparently actively 
trying to obfuscate what the heck is going on.
