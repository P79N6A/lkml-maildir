Could very well be the netboot stuff. I typically flash BIOS/firmware 
via DOS network boot images, which provides at least two different ways 
of disk emulation: a: and c:, but some flash tools just freeze the 
system on load/image load in both ways. Most prominently is the Promise 
TX2/100 firmware update, but also a couple of motherboards BIOS' 
flashers behave that way (cannot remember which ones, though).
