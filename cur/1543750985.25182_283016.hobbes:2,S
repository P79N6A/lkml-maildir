William, I strongly agree with you regarding this (fortunately, it seems to
happen sometimes :-))
Speaking for myself, I read and try to understand *all* the changelog of 2.4
pre releases, and even often take a look at linux.bkbits.net to see if some
things have changed, that I could grab before waiting for a release, but I
almost never read 2.6 changelog (except the first hundreds of lines that Linus
announces with a final release), because it's far too much. I don't even know
how some people still keep in touch with this amount of changes.
Cheers,
Willy
