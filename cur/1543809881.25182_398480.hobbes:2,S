Aha!  This is a very valid reason why we should export partition  
types from the kernel to userspace:  Partitions/devices that appear  
to have 2 different filesystems/formats.  The _kernel_ cannot  
reliably tell which to use.  On the other hand, a properly configured  
_userspace_ initramfs could use configured partition-type  
information, a small config file, and a user-configurable detection  
algorithm to figure out that the device is _actually_ the first  
segment of an ext3-on-LVM-on-RAID1, instead of a raw ext3, and mount  
it appropriately.  Now, this requires that the admin correctly  
specify the partition types, but that seems a bit more reliable than  
depending on the probe-order to get things right.
Cheers,
