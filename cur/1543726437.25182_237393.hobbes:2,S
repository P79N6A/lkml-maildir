PRIVATE AND URGENT.
First I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of it's nature as being utterly confidential and top 
secret. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am 
assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. There is no doubt that trust conceptually is a conundrum which 
leads itself to deferring interpretation, we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. 
I am the manager, bills and exchange at the foreign remittance department of the SBM Nedbank International Bank, 
Mauritius I came to know you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle this Confidential 
Transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence.
PROPOSITION;
We discovered an abandoned sum of US$17,320,000.00 (seventeen million three hundred and twenty thousand united 
states dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family of a 
wife and two children in november 1998 in a plane crash. Since his death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come 
forward to lay claims for this money as the heir. We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies 
for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, unfortunately, no family member nor 
relative has ever appeared to claim the said fund. Upon this discovery, we now seek your permission to have you stand 
as next of kin to the deceased so that the funds (seventeen million three hundred and twenty thousand united states 
dollars) can be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary's next of kin otherwise the fund will be returned to 
treasury as unclaimed funds which will subsequently be donated to the trust fund for arms and ammunition to further 
enhance the course of war in the World. All documents to enable you receive this funds will be carefully worked out by 
us as we already have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any of deceased beneficiaries, and more 
so we are assuring you that this business is safe.
Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavour by furnishing me with the 
following;
1. Beneficiary name and address
2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers
These requirements will enable us file letters of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your 
favour before the transfer can be made. We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus; On final 
conclusion of this project, 65% of this surplus shall be for us, while 30% shall be for you and the remaining 5% shall 
be used to compensate either party for any expenses incurred. Your share stays while the rest shall be for us for 
investment purposes. 
Whilst this anormalities may well raise your doubts in view of the fact that you are a person not physically known to us, 
I advice that a healthy degree of caution be exercised before conclusions are reached by your goodself. If this proposal is 
acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of the trust we have bestowed in you, I await your urgent mail. Please
