Hi everybody,
I just wanted to let you know that 2.1.132 does not fix the network
problems I have. I still get the following messages in syslog:
eth0: Tx timed out, lost interrupt? TSR=0x3,ISR=0x3, t=816.
eth0: Tx timed out, lost interrupt? TSR=0x3,ISR=0x3, t=1000.
I don't know if this is interesting but it allways seems to kill the
network on the first collision:
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:00:B4:32:4C:87
          inet addr:195.37.122.246  Bcast:195.37.122.255  Mask:255.255.255.255
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:2320 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:3722 errors:50 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:1 txqueuelen:100
