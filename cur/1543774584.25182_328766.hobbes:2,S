I did a series of tests well after resier3 had fsck that consisted of
modelling the behaviour of systems under error state. I modelled random
bit errors, bit errors at a fixed offset (class ram failure), sector 4
byte slip (known IDE fail case) and sectors going away.
Reiserfs didn't handle it anything like as gracefully as ext2. Its a
pretty easy experiment to write the code for and the results are
interesting.
