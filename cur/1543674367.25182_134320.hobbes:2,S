I'm using an older laptop and would like to get pcmcia working.
I see in the archives that someone else reported a similar problem about
a month ago but there were no replies.  I guess nobody knows whats
wrong...
I'm using 2.5.69 (but only after trying the 2.4 series).
Can anyone shed some light on this problem?
I'm able to spend some time on this - but I'm not very familiar with the
kernel internals so I'd appreciate some hand holding to get me started.
thanks!
brad
