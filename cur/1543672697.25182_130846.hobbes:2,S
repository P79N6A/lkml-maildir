I'll give that a try tomorrow.

It happens on both of the machines I tried (server and laptop).
I think the only common hardware between the two is the net
controller which is intel etherpro 100 based. I'll check tomorrow
to be sure.
There was essentially no work load (no net traffic, no CPU
intensive program, no disk activity). I was just doing simple
loopback tests on our serial devices (PCI based on server
and PC Card on laptop).
