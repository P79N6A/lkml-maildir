Well, on the other hand you are the only person that really has
problems with me.

You seem to be using different definition of maintainer than rest of
the world.

If I rephrase my comments as:
"The idea is okay, but the implementation is broken, because it does
too much stuff in the kernel."
and
"Here's how you could do that better; take a look at latest -mm and
use facilities it provides to push most of suspend2 code into
userland."
...will that help?

Oh... did not seen that mail thread. Please cc: me on suspend-related
stuff.
