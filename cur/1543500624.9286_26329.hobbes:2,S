>How many nfsd threads?
  As part of a potential future project we are looking to substantially
improve the performance of the linux nfs client.  In particular we will
be looking at parallel reads over fast switched networks.  
  Unfortunately we don't have the resources in house to do the work
required.  Therefore we are looking to contract this out with any
developments contributed back to the main source tree.  We have
already aproached a couple of kernel developers but they are currently
too bust to undertake this.
  If you are interested then contact me for more details.
