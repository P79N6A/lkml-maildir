The problem is that we don't know:
* if there is a FIFO
* what size the FIFO is
* if it has been initialised
* how much data is already contained in the FIFO
So we can't really blindly initialise the FIFO in the console write
method.  Neither can we initialise it in the console setup.  If we
could initialise it, we can't blindly load 16 bytes into the FIFO
at a time.
I don't think it's technically practical to use the FIFO for the
console and still have a reliable serial port.
