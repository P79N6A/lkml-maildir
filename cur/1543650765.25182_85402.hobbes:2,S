JA,
Would you mind sending each one of this updates to linux-kernel CC me in
separate emails ?
I should have applied Dave Jones patch before (it has been around for a
while), but now its too late.
Maybe Ingo's fix to crashes with CLONE_DETACHED threads is suitable for
-rc2.
Anyway, I'll save the ones which are not suitable for -rc1 in my pending
fixes list.
Thanks
