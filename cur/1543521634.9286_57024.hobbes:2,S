If a driver needs to have a private structure that associates with each "real"
file (inode instance) then what is the recommended technique?  Private hash
table on major/minor?  What is the officially recommended technique here.
I obviously misunderstood that the generic_ip was like a private structure
pointer in a number of other kernel control structures, such as net_device.
