    My guess would be either (1) miscompilation or (2) hardware problems.
    Ad (1): Don't use gcc-2.95 without -fno-strict-aliasing.
            Don't forget make oldconfig; make dep; make clean
    Ad (2): Does this kernel run on another machine?
            Does another kernel run on this machine?
        Memory/CPU testing: Memory testers: memtest86.
                            100 kernel compilations
                    targzippping kernel source tree, untarring and
                                 comparing several times.
    Just some ideas.
Well, of course I sent it to the list because I think it is
a kernel bug. It smells like one.
Hardware? Three days old. One crash. Very heavy use at the
moment of crash. Two ethernet cards were transferring Gigabytes
from one machine to another. Gcc was active. Netscape was active.
I started yast and the machine crashed the same moment.
Bad memory? Have not had time for memtest86. Have read two 17 GB disks
several times with  dd if=/dev/disk | md5sum  and find consistent answers.
Have simultaneously tarred and untarred some trees and compiled some
kernels - no problems. There are no typical signs of flaky hardware.
(This is a Pentium II, 256 MB.)
Miscompilation? Well as I said, this was a fresh SuSE 6.1 install,
and the gcc that comes with it says
# cc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/egcs-2.91.66/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314 (egcs-1.1.2 release)
Miscompilation is a definite possibility. This version of cc
is certainly somewhat broken - it sometimes produces strange warnings.
I don't know whether it produces bad code.
Let me show you an example of egcs-2.91.66 behaviour:
----------------------------- foo.c ------------------------------------
void panic(const char * fmt, ...)
        __attribute__ ((noreturn, format (printf, 1, 2)));
void printk(const char * fmt, ...)
        __attribute__ ((format (printf, 1, 2)));
struct SC {
     void (*fn)(int);
};
extern int get_int(void);
extern struct SC * get_SC(void);
void
foo() {
     int mbo;
     struct SC * p = get_SC();
     if(!p) panic("Ouch!");
     while (1){
          mbo = get_int();
          if (mbo < 0) {
               printk("%d\n", mbo);
               return;
          }
          if (p->fn)
               (p->fn)(0);
          else
               printk("fn NULL?\n");
     }
}
-----------------------------------------------------
# cc -Wall -O2 -c foo.c
foo.c: In function `foo':
foo.c:18: warning: `mbo' might be used uninitialized in this function
#
Strange.. - mbo is used after an assignment to it.
How can it be uninitialized?
And the strange part is, this is a minimal example:
every simplification of this example makes the complaint go away.
(Changing fn to be  void (*fn)(void); or deleting the
 `else printk("fn NULL?\n");' part, or deleting the `return;',
 or changing the panic into a printk.
 Also deleting the -O2 flag makes the complaint go away.)
So, egcs-2.91.66 with -O2 is confused about the flow of control.
With some phantasy I can imagine that, once confused, gcc manages
to optimize away some code that is necessary, or miscompile in
some other way.
I'll cc this to linux-gcc and egcs-bugs@egcs.cygnus.com.
