Is that also true for embedded systems ? I mean we may not found
any rngd on these systems.
One other question now: suppose that others drivers need to use
random data during their inits. At this time userspace appli still not
have been started. How does it work ?

Well I'm working on a secure SOC which have a randown hardware
which is supposed to return true random data. I understand that 
some self tests on the random data are needed but doing them in 
userspace is suprising.
