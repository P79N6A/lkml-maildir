Hello!
In article <AEEEJLJGDLODKEHHFIABMECPCFAA.kwooten@home.com> you write:
>Is there any way to call a user-space function from within a kernel module,
>providing at some point a function pointer was passed in? If so how would

No precise hints, but you could look at the way how signal handler
functions are called.
Another way is to avoid the problem, using instead a userland<->kernel
socket (or similar) connection and some "remote procedure call" over
that socket.
Hope that helps a bit.
Kind regards,
Hannah.
