Surprise - I was not able to reproduce the problem with oss. Whereas with 
alsa I was able to lock my PC again. What I do - just load respective 
drivers and either "jackd -v -d alsa" or "jackd -v -d oss". And then just 
put some load in the background + try to start ardour... With alsa I 
wasn't even able to start it. With oss it did run, and no xruns reported 
from jackd. Normal non-rt kernel. jackd started without --realtime.
Ouch
Thanks
