Hi,
I have continuing problems with getting the initrd ramdisk out of memory once
bootup is complete.
This is with recent -ac kernels which have the fix-up posted a few months ago
applied.
The sequence is roughly:
- boot via pxelinux, loads up bzImage <1MB and root.romfs.gz ~7MB, expands to
  about 30.
- mount -n -t tmpfs none tmp
- cp root -> /tmp
- pivot_root -> /tmp
- umount old_root/dev (devfs kernel)
- umount old_root
Then another pivot_root a bit later on before /sbin/init is invoked. The
point is to move the initrd to a tmpfs which will reclaim memory in the event
that the filesystem cannot be unmounted, due to having mountpoints for
loopback host filesystems in this case.
It seems to work fine, and the initrd _does_ unmount with no problems
(unmounting old_root/dev does complain about mtab, but works, ls old_root/dev
shows empty). However, blockdev --flushbufs /dev/rd/0 fails with busy on
BLKFLSBUF once the system is running.
About the only odd thing besides the message about mtab from umount is the
kernel notice right before entering /bin/sh on the romfs initrd - it prints
out two messages about mounting the ramdisk:

May 22 09:14:31 wintermute kernel: Mounted devfs on /dev
May 22 09:14:31 wintermute kernel: Trying to unmount old root ... okay
Perhaps they're bumping up the reference count so that it is impossible to
free the ramdisk later?
Thanks very much for any help!
