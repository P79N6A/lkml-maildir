I'm experiencing missing file issues on a commercial Joliet
CD-ROM.  Kernel is 2.2.1, using scsi host adapter emulation for
the ATAPI CD-ROM drive.  CD-ROM drive is Hewlett-Packard CD-Writer
Plus 8100.
On sucessive mountings of the same disk, I get the following
outputs from 'find /mnt/cdrom | wc -l':
   9790 corel.list.1
   9790 corel.list.2
   9724 corel.list.3  (-o nojoliet)
   9668 corel.list.4
   9661 corel.list.5
   9722 corel.list.6
In the case I investigated, (2->3), the missing files in 3
seem to be confined to a few directories, one with ~80 files,
and the other with ~300 files.
I have not seen this problem with Rockridge disks, and since
I write ~5 a week and then verify them, I figure I would have
noticed.
