I put suspend support into 2.4 serial driver and use it. It does work.
2.6 serial driver suspend was not working a year ago, have not tried since.

Luckily not on several of my machines and the linux 2.4 driver at least 
does not turn the lines on until resume tells it to do so...

still 1 ;) and the same thing would apply to using an USB dongle and 
there will be many applications were it hurts as well.
Then, extra resume is not required, it's bad when it causes strain on the 
power source (notebook battery low), is a clumsy implementation and slows 
suspend process down.
