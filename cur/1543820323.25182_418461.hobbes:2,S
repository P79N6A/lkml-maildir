Thanks. Obviously we agree heartily :-)

Yes. The current design, which builds directly on top of the CFQ 
scheduler, does not attempt to treat kernel
threads specially in order to account the I/O they're doing on behalf of 
others properly. This was mainly because
of the desire to keep the controller simple.
I suspect pdflush and vmscan I/O is never going to be properly 
attributable and journaling may be possible but
unlikely to be worth it given the risks of throttling it ?  AIO is 
likely to be something we can address if there is
consensus that one is willing to pay the price of tracking the source 
through the I/O submission layers.
I suppose this would be a good time to dust off the I/O controller and 
post it so discussions can become more
concrete.
But as always, changes in the design and implementation are always 
welcome....
