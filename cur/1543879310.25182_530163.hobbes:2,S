Well, it often doesn't end there, other users may report these as bugs and 
want to get them fixed, so we have to look ahead a little for possible 
problems.

It has everything to do with this. It describes the terminal capabilities, 
so why should variable width support not one part of it?

Wrong question: why is it a problem the kernel doesn't know this?
It's usually easy to "fix" this in the kernel, because it's last in line, 
but we have to look at the whole picture and the kernel isn't solely 
responsible for unicode handling, so why can't this be fixed at 
application level?
