But the ACPI DSDT is OS independant in theory and in practice to a fair
extent. It can't make assumptions about windows drivers.

HDAPS wants to be able to talk with the IDE/libata layer to request it
to hold off requests, thats very different to "gee I wonder what the
bios did"

Ok

Its probably easier to write than go find one
I mean you need
tp_hw_init() {
   if (not a thinkpad) return -ENODEV
   request_region(...)
   return 0
}
tp_hw_exit() {
   release_region(...)
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(tp_hw_lock); 
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(tp_hw_unlock);
tp_hw_lock() {
    down(&tp_sem);
}
tp_hw_unlock() {
    up(&tp_sem);
}
/* And perhaps if the port varies by machine */
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(tp_hw_addr);
tp_hw_addr() {
    return 0x1600;
}
It can really be that simple
