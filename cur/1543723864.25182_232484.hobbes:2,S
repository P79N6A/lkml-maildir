The point is we are sending a bigger window scale then we need to.
The maximum receive window is limited by tcp_rmem[2], so we only need to
allow that much.  Having a different sysctl just for that is unnecessary and
potentially confusing.
The default tcp_rmem[2] is 174760, so we only need a wscale of 2 to represent
that. We were sending 7.
