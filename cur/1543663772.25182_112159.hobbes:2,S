Good point.  However, we are in a position to compare test results of 
older linux kernels against newer, and to recompile code out of the 
kernel for specific applications.  I'm curious if there is a collection 
of lmbench results of hand configured and compiled kernels vs the vendor 
module based kernels across 2.0, 2.2, 2.4 and recent 2.5 on the same 
uniprocessor and dual processor configuration.  That would really give 
us a better idea of how a properly tuned kernel vs what people actually 
use for support reasons is costing us, and if we're winning or losing.
