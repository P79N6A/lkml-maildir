Subject: Problem installing Promise SATA150 TX2plus driver

When trying to 'insmod' the Promise SATA150 TX2plus driver mentioned
in this message:
http://www.van-dijk.net/linuxkernel/200330/1084.html.gz
I get these errors:
/lib/modules/2.4.20-8smp/kernel/drivers/scsi/pdc-ultra.o: unresolved symbol
scsi_unregister_module
and ...scsi_register, ...scsi_register_module, ...scsi_unregister
The driver was built from source according to the instructions,
*directly* after a fresh install (with kernel headers) of RedHat 9.
(install RH, reboot, wget driver, make -C cam, make, cp, insmod)
The box is a dual Xeon 2.4
The primary HD is a Maxtor 6Y160PO. The secondary, for which i need
the driver, is a WDC Raptor WD360GD SATA. The controler is a Promise
SATA150 TX2plus.
What do I need to do to fix the errors and install the driver ?
