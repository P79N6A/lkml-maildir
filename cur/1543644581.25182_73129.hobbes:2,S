Not only disk errors are common, but also CPU/memory/chipset/wiring errors are.

Oh, I missed your original email, thanks for noticing me.

Hm. This is still much larger than 20 bytes we use.

Actually we submit data to disk in 512 byte chunks (4k blocksize case),
and disk should not write any data before it receives all of it and
checks the integrity (hm, this is only true for UDMA, though.)
Still I do not see why any sane disk would start to write a sector before fully
receiving new sector's content (thinking of disk drives of course, solid state
stuff should take its own measures in this direction too).
This is even more insane than ACKing data and putting it in not battery
backed cache to be lost on power loss (Yes, I know this is a common
practice now. At least there is a way either to turn such feature off
or to flush a cache on demand).
Thanks for bringing our attention to such issues, though changing disk format
is our of questions for reiser3 now, some kind of verifying single instance
on-disk structures may/will be incorporated in reiser4.
Bye,
