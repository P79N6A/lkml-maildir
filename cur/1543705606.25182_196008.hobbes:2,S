I had the same problem a while ago.
The cause was: I've a cron-job that cleans logfiles
via bash script. This bash script shuts down syslogd and restarts
it. After cleaning the logs, kernel-messages didn't reach userspace
anymore. The solution was to not only shut down syslogd but also
klogd.
So, try to restart klogd _and_ syslogd.
