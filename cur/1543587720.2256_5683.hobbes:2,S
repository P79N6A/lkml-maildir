This is exactly right.  On IA64, we have to hide the physical
processor ID (processor bus/local ID pair) completely.  As far as I
can see, but it's been awhile, so forgive me if I miss one or two,
IA64 doesn't expose the physical processor ID at all, outside the IPI
and AP startup code.

Yep.  If not simply to make the generic kernel code clearer, this will
also make it easier to support non-linear (NUMA) systems.
