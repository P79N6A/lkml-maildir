We already have a timer trigger which takes an on time and an off time
for the reason you mention above (floating point would get ugly).
The problem is mainly about finding ways to enable hardware acceleration
of the existing timer trigger (where possible) and maybe implementing a
simpler blink trigger which could be hardware accelerated when the full
blown timer trigger couldn't.
