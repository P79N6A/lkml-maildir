I have no idea and I don't have hdparm sources handy here.
You could probably with an strace of hdparm.

I'm on a redhat 4.2 box right now and that man page
is probably not up to date. I'll check my own system
tonight.

You must have 2.3.16 to get the capabilitites right.

Sorry, there was a fix in 2.3.16 to correctly report
the capabilities with the ioctl - I forgot about that.
2.3.16 gets them right, ioctl included.

Yes, it has been like this for a very long time. But now
cdrom.c also defaults to checking the media type which
makes it fail hard. That's the significant change.
