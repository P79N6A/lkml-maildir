Ahhh, but it's not necessarily about making this common case
better. It's about making sure Linux doesn't die horribly in
some worst cases.
The case of "system has more than enough memory" won't suffer
with -rmap anyway since the amount of activity in the VM part
of the system will be relatively low.

The thing here is that -rmap is able to easily balance the
reclaiming of cache with the swapout of anonymous pages.
Even though you tried to get rid of the magic numbers in
the old VM when you introduced your changes, you're already
back up to 4 magic numbers for the cache/swapout balancing.
This is not your fault, being difficult to balance is just
a fundamental property of the partially physical, partially
virtual scanning.

Sharing is quite a can of worms, it might be easier to just use
4MB (or 2MB) pages for database shared memory segments and VMAs
where programs want large pages. That will get rid of both the
page tables (and associated locking) and the alignment constraints.
