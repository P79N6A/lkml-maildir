Yes. Some locking will be needed. I haven't yet figured out the exact sequence 
of function calls during configuration of an interface from userland.
Is there a hold-count kind of a thing on network interface components (like 
inodes, dentries)?
I am still using userland to bring an interface up. I guess it's best done 
inside the kernel instead of using notifications and spawning a thread. Then 
the interface would be usable much earlier.
Thanks.
