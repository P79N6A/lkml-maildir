Subject: Why does test9 outlaw HZ < 48?

UML has HZ == 20.  When I built test9, I ran into trouble with this new block 
in include/linux/timex.h:
#if HZ >= 24 && HZ < 48
# define SHIFT_HZ	5
#elif HZ >= 48 && HZ < 96
# define SHIFT_HZ	6
...
I added the obvious 12 <= HZ < 24 lines and got this from kernel/timer.c:
timer.c:446: warning: right shift count is negative
timer.c:449: warning: right shift count is negative
Those lines are these:
time_adj -= -ltemp >> (SHIFT_USEC + SHIFT_HZ - SHIFT_SCALE);
time_adj += ltemp >> (SHIFT_USEC + SHIFT_HZ - SHIFT_SCALE);
When you chase down the constants (the others are in timex.h, too), the shift 
value turns out to be:
	16 + SHIFT_HZ - 22
16 + SHIFT_HZ - 22 >= 0 implies SHIFT_HZ >= 6.
Now, my questions are:
What's the reasoning behind these magic numbers?  The comment associated with 
those constants is less than illumunating IMHO.
Is there anything wrong with HZ < 48?  If not, what's the right way to get it 
without upsetting the compiler?
