nd.mnt is what?  NULL?  There's your oops.
Grab fs/nfsctl.c::do_open() and s/nfsd/proc/g in there.  FWIW, it's probably
better off in libfs.c with fs type as argument...  For now, just copy it -
it's trivial and small enough; when I move the sucker to libfs, we'll
switch to that.  And lose that deactivate_super(), obviously - you won't
be touching superblock anymore.
And for pity sake,

out: ;

is spelled
