I think we can probably exclude root-only local DoS from the full
embargo treatment for starters. The recent /dev/random sysctl one was
in that category.
I can imagine some local DoS bugs that are worth keeping a lid on for
a bit. Classic F00F bug may have been a good example. But hole in an
arbitrary driver may not.
