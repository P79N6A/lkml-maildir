Hmm. You do not confuse two situations, do you?
In the past few days I made two devices work.
One was a Feiya 5-in-1 CF / SM / SD card reader
(Vendor Id: 090c, Product Id: 1132, Revision 1.00).
It returned a capacity that is one too large, and becomes
very unhappy if one tries to read a sector past the end.
So, a flag was needed to tell that the result of READ CAPACITY
needs fixing.
The other was a Travelmate CF / SM / SD card reader
(Vendor Id: 3538, Product Id: 0001, Revision 2.05).
It became unhappy when MODE_SENSE asked for too much data.
A patch on sd.c solved this.
