I have a Dell Latitude C800 -- I'll give your patch a try later
today.
On a related note...  I recently updated to Bios A20 and I find
the fan stays on after resuming...  Also, in order for resume to
complete sucessfully I find I need to never start X with dri so
that agp support and the r128 module are not loaded.  If they
load then the laptop hangs when doing a resume.  Known problems?
