Ok. Sure. That's what I was told when I first encountered this.
That's why I'm reporting this again now that the WD drive is gone.

Ok. Done. That's what I'm reporting: The Maxtor, generally thought of
as the better drive of the two, is still getting an occasional
timeout -> switchback to PIO. (The machine is essentially diskless
with a LARGE internal disk. Yeah, I'm weird... ;-)

Sure. There is now about 130km between the two. That good enough?
