And change every script from dev=b,d,l to dev=/dev/cdN. Without hitting
the actual SCSI CD's, and of course the scd0 (ATAPI on ide-scsi) goes away
so you have to rename all of your real SCSI CD's.
On a simple system with one ATAPI CD the problem is small, but on a larger
and busier system with a fair number of CD-RW drives, it is likely to be a
real pain, and if you forget to convert back you mess up production stuff.
It's not impossible, just something I would rather not do unless the
system is going permanently to 2.6, maybe not even then, since what I have
works fine.
