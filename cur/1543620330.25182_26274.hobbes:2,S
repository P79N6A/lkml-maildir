I now fiddled a little with the PCI settings in the BIOS...
When 'PCI master read cahing' is enabled everything works fine (sound 
works, cooling works. When disabled I get sound skips. The above flags 
are exactly the same:
Athlon/Duron CLK_Ctrl Value found : fff0d22f
Athlon/Duron CLK_Ctrl Value set to : fff0d22f
Enabling disconnect in VIA northbridge: KT133/KX133 chipset found
As I think i noted earlier, my motherboard is KT133A-based.
My system functions perfectly stable with the 'PCI master read caching' 
enabled - I have no idea whether this is true in general.

Rasmus
