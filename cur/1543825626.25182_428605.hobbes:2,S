My bet is that in this case I was storing a LOT of 
data in the thread structure, so the space left for 
the stack was massively reduced. 
I was using a debugging tool for taking snapshots of the
top 16 PC's on the stack when you take a spinlock; for 
each premption level. It's thread specific data, so the 
thread structure seemed like a reasonable place to store it.

Sure but the debugger environment must tolerate larger stacks.
A developer may prefer to use a larger stack, like in my case
of storing debug info in the thread structure. The interrupt 
stack checks can easily miss nicking the thread structure, so
increasing the stack size for experimentation SHOULD always work.

But this can miss a minor abuse. The interrupt check
is a quick and simple hack but I wonder if it's really
optimal for commercial implementations.

Yep, like viewing the stack with kgdb. With Solaris all of the task use
the same virtual address space for the stack, so mapping in a physical
page was easy. Linux stacks are mapped linear 1:1 to physical pages, 
so it's not easy.

I think all modules should be ABLE to be built in. 2.6 has made good
progress in that regard. I'd prefer to see kgdb also ABLE to be linked
in or a module; just like most modules are doing now. I don't see an
advantage to the Linux community to REQUIRING the kgdb module to 
NOT being ABLE to be linked in. Using modules often requires more
work to set up and get working right. It has it's advantages, I'd
prefer to leave it up to the developer to choose. Sometimes you
unload a module and pre-existing callbacks can mess up things in
unexpected way when the size of data structures change. I've used
kgdb on modules but for stuff like the TCP stack I really don't
want to mess with that. I'd prefer we make it easier for users
to get set up for kernel debugging. Just config kgdb, avoid using
kernel modules, install and run. Having kgdb in the kernel source
tree doesn't preclude it's use as a module. It does require it to
be under the GNU license. Unfortunately the HPUX kgdb patch wasn't
under the GNU license; it had some nice features, like kgdb over
TCP with ssh encryption. An that was 10 years ago!

Yea, I saw that, too bad we can't seem to get a version of kgdb into
the kernel that can be update with the rest of the kernel. As I recall
NetBSD, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD have always done it that way. 'We' almost
got George Anzinger's kgdb patch into Linux; it was working great in the
mm series. Seems it should all be configurable with #ifdef CONFIG_KGDB
just like other kernel features. If you want to support other debuggers
than gdb I suppose common trap code could use a common CONFIG_* token.
