The fundamental problem is that MPPE is misusing CCP (compression
control protocol) for something for which it was never intended.  The
specific place where this is a problem is that the compression code in
ppp_generic doesn't guarantee that it will never send a packet out
uncompressed, but MPPE requires that.  How do you get around that
problem?

Paul.
