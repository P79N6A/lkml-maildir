I don't see that is necessary.

If a driver has low_latency set, flush_to_ldisc
can be called from both scheduled work (due to
hitting TTY_DONT_FLIP) and directly from an ISR.
On an SMP system, they can run in parallel.
I don't know for sure that is the path being hit,
it could be some other odd combination.
But there is no inherent serialization
of flush_to_ldisc.
