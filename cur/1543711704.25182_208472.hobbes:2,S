Yes. It's almost exclusively used once per week for backup purposes.
Speed doesn't matter for that (about 400 MB of often changing data on
/home), reliability counts.
Data that doesn't really change (old kernel releases and such) is
also on MO, but that's "write once, than forget about it", so once
again speed doesn't matter that much.
