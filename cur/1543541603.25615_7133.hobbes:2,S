I am not a Kernel developer, but have become familiar with the command line
options through reading Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt in the source
tree. You'd need to install the Kernel source to read this; as I understand
it, Slackware just includes the headers unless you specifically ask for the
whole source.
It's there in both 2.2.16 and 2.4.0-testn. Have a look in init/main.c too
(again, in the Kernel source).
