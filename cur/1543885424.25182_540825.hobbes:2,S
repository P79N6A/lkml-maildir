Are you sure this is the version you wanted to send? I don't see how this could
compile without this #ifndef. And also there is some problem with undefined
processor_id, but this is not your fault, but a flaw in the pre-rc1
kernel, which
I hope is now noticed. So maybe you should just send the patches made for
the 2.6.21 kernel?
Otherwise, when applied on top of my 2.6.20 kernel, the driver just
works (at least
I see the pings, haven't considered any other tests yet), thank you a lot!
