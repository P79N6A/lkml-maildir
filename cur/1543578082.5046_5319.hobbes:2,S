	[Venkatesh Ramamurthy]  Our AMI RAID controller and MegaRAID driver
( part of kernel) supports full blown 64 bit and we have successfully tested
with more than 4 GB RAM under IA32 (uses bounce buffer) and IA64 systems. We
are seeing a dramatic performance drop on IA32 with 8GB ram as it has to do
bounce buffering. I think we need this support to give our dear old linux a
lead compared to other OS'es.
