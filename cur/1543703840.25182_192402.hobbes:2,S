I also have a SB Live!, and it doesn't work with ALSA at all - the AC97
codec doesn't load. I haven't taken the time to track it down as it does
work just fine with OSS (under SMP at that).

That's a purely firmware thing with this card; you should just have to
load the right patches. I don't know whether there is a loader utility
for alsa, though. Perhaps the old utils will work?
Anyway, even if it's not working for me at the moment, it's still the
superior architecture; just wait until the bugs affecting your specific
situation are ironed out and userland utilities are available...
