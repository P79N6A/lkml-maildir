Subject: [PATCH 3/3] mm/Kconfig: give DISCONTIG more help text
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/11/267

This gives DISCONTIGMEM a bit more help text to explain
what it does, not just when to choose it.

+	  This option provides enhanced support for discontiguous
+	  memory systems, over FLATMEM.  These systems have holes
+	  in their physical address spaces, and this option provides
+	  more efficient handling of these holes.  However, the vast
+	  majority of hardware has quite flat address spaces, and
+	  can have degraded performance from extra overhead that
+	  this option imposes.
+
+	  Many NUMA configurations will have this as the only option.
+
 	  If unsure, choose "Flat Memory" over this option.
