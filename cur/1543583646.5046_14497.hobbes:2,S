Ah hah!  There's a huge difference in performance (in my experience) with
DMA.  also, using hdparm utility, *most* drives work fine with dma,
irq unmasking, multisector transfers, and 32bit access.
hdparm -i /dev/hda or such will tell you maximum multisector supported.
the only reason these aren't enabled AFAIK is that SOME drives don't,
and when there's a problem it could cause data loss.
The worker thread may just have been overtaking the prefetcher
because dma was off and disk was slow.
