Use a kernel supporting "large files".  Two possibilities are:
2.4 kernel
2.2.x kernel with the LFS patch.  
http://www.scyld.com
 has a patch that
successfully applies from 2.2.12 through 2.2.17.  That patch introduced
an error in fcntl processing (I submitted a patch to Scyld, and I can
provide it to you), but I don't know if they've applied it yet.  The LFS
patch is stable, I've run terabytes through it.

I have *read* that mysql 3.23 allows splitting large tables over
multiple files; the same source also claimed "but indexes don't work
using that mechnism." Don't know the details or correctness of this
statement.
