The Roxen webserver (www.roxen.com) in multithreaded mode works
(almost) like this: it has a request accepting and data shuffling thread
(select()/poll()-based) and a pool of "request handling" threads, with a
requests queue inbetween.
It also has a single-thread mode where the data shuffler does the
actual work too.
A third mode (Accept And Parse) is being deeveloped. It uses lightweight
threads (and sendfile()) for even better performance.
