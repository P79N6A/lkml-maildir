Not true. They'll drift further and further apart over time.
Even a 0.01% crystal difference will eventually kill you.
And if that isn't bad enough think about what happens when I run 180 MHz
processors in one node, and 900MHz in another.
You really can't make any assumptions about TSC sync on boxes where
they're not synced.
