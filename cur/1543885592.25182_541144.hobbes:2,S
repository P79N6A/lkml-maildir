hrm, spose so.
It can be a bit suboptimal from the layout POV.  The reservations code will
largely save us here, but kernel support might make it a bit better.
Totally blowing pagecache could be a problem.  Fixable in userspace by
using sync_file_range()+fadvise() or O_DIRECT, but I bet it doesn't.
