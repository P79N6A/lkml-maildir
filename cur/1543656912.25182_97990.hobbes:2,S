Having a boot-time parameter is useful, but I'd like it to default to off
without a paramater for the platforms where it's just broken. At the
moment there's an "if (clustered_apic_mode) return;" stuck at the top
of balance_irq, the latest series of patches changes that to
"if (no_balance_irq) return;", which is set by NUMA-Q. If we can set
up no_balance_irq to default correctly, but be possibly overridden by
the boot-time parameter, I think we'd have the best of both worlds.
