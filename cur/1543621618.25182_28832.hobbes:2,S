A while back I had some problems I mentioned here.  My computer wouldn't
work without turning off the top 16 megabytes with mem=.  Anyway, it
works now.  My video card (Permedia II based Leadtek Winfast 2300) was
buggy.  My spare test video card apparently caused similar problems.
Thank you to those who tried to help out.  To those I offended or
bothered, I am sorry.
Things are great.
