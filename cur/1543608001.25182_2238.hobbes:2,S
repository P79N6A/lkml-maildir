Hi,
If a I get an error saying
"Kernel Panic ! Problem while Syncing in Interrupt handler" 
what does it suggest.
the objective is to override eth0's hard_start_xmit()
& catch all outgoing packets. Pkts are getting queued
& a timer gets activated every 5 mins (for throwing dequeuing
a pkt & throwing it out -- by calling the original
eth0->hard_start_xmit() ).
I ain't using BHs/Spinlocks/Tasklets/SoftIRQs on Linux-2.4.2
Any guesses as to why it's happening ?
Thanks,
Rajat.
