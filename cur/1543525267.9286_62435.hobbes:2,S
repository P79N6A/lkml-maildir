Agreed.  Back in the early 2.2 days I changed the kernel in a generic
way not to checksum outgoing TCP/UDP packets if it knew the card could
handle it, and experimented using a Packet Engines Hamachi gigE.  The
changes to the stack are fairly small, and the gains are near
negligible (max 5% faster) since a checksum while copying is indeed
free.
The curious might see

 but I'd much
rather see the card DMA the unchecksummed payload directly from
userspace.
