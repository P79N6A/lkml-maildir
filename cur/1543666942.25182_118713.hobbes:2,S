I think that the available Documentetion about "REcompiling a kernel" is a 
little confusing (about the use of "make clean").
EXAMPLES:
source: "The Linux Kernel HOWTO"
...When the configure script ends, it also tells you to `make dep' and 
(possibly) `clean'...
...For older versions of the kernel, when finished, you should do a `make 
clean'...
...In any case, do not forget this step before attempting to recompile a 
kernel. 
	possibly?
	only for older versions of kernel?
	in any case?
	WHEN?
source: www.linuxchix.org
...Sometimes, you'll change things so much that "make" can't figure out how 
to recompile the files correctly. "make clean" will remove all the object 
files (ending in .o) and a few other things...
	ok, this seems more convincing...
Can anyone be more clear?
Bye,
Paolo
