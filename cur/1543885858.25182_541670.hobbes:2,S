BTW (this could be unrelated to the original issue here), but can
anybody ever have a _genuine_ excuse to use spin_lock_irq /
spin_unlock_irq and not spin_lock_irqsave / spin_unlock_restore? I
find the latter primitives more tasteful even when I *know* something
is being called with interrupts enabled / disabled -- you never know
when some code is re-used again somewhere else and/or ripped out of
one place and put inside another ... the former API only invites
trouble, if anything.
