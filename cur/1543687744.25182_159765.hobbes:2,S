Yes, one cpu/node.  Oh, it does prevent it, but with the current intervals, we 
end up not really balancing as often (since we need a inter-node balance), 
and when we call load_balance in schedule when idle, we don't balance at all 
since it's only a node local balance.

I think AMD would be the first good test.  Maybe Andi has some results on 
numasched vs O(1), which would be a good indication.
