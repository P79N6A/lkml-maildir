Here I'm going to differ with you. The premises of the SLAB concept
(from the original paper) are: 
a) fragmentation of conventional allocators gets worse over time
b) grouping objects of the same -type- (not size) together should mean
they have similar lifetimes and thereby keep fragmentation low
c) slabs can be O(1)
d) constructors and destructors are cache-friendly
There's some truth to (a), but the problem has been quite overstated,
pre-SLAB Linux kernels and countless other systems run for years. And
(b) is known to be false, you just have to look at our dcache and icache
pinning. (c) of course is a whole separate argument and often trumps the
others. And (d) is pretty much crap now too.
And as it happens, SLOB basically always beats SLAB on size.
SLUB only wins when it starts merging caches of different -types- based
on -size-, effectively throwing out the whole (b) concept. Which is
good, because its wrong. So SLUB starts to look a lot like a purely
size-binned allocator.

I think both SLOB and SLUB punt everything >= PAGE_SIZE off to the page
allocator.

It is known to be crummy, but it is NOT known to actually be worse than
the SLAB/SLUB approach when you consider both internal and external
fragmentation. Power-of-two ala SLAB kmalloc basically guarantees your
internal fragmentation will be 30% or so.
In fact, first-fit is known to be pretty good if the ratio of object
size to arena size is reasonable. I've already shown a system booting
with 6% overhead compared to SLUB's 35% (and SLAB's nearly 70%). The
fragmentation measurements for the small object list are in fact quite
nice. Not the best benchmark, but it certainly shows that there's
substantial room for improvement.
Where it hurts is larger objects (task structs, SKBs), which are also a
problem for SLAB/SLUB and I don't think any variation on the search
order is going to help there. If we threw 64k pages at it, those
problems might very well disappear. Hell, it's pretty tempting to throw
vmalloc at it, especially on small boxes..

Will think about that. Most of the literature here is of limited
usefulness - even Knuth didn't look at 4k heaps, let alone collections
of them.

The SLOB allocator is inherently two-level. I'm using a next-fit-like
approach to decide which heap (page) to use and first-fit within that
heap.
