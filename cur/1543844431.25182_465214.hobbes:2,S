It would help if you would actually look at the code instead of presuming. 
No changes are made in that area.

I would not presume proposing anything for PPC64 and left everything the 
way it is. The arch people can control if they want ZONE DMA or not and 
the default is to leave things as is. If PPC64 wants to go ZONE_DMAless 
then the arch code needs to be modified not refer to ZONE_DMA anymore and 
if that works then we can switch CONFIG_ZONE_DMA off for PPC64. See the 
patches in mm for examples how other arches have done it.

This was covered at length before. Removing all GFP_DMA references would 
require extensive #ifdefs. The limited patch in mm is only neutering 
GFP_DMA for arches that do not need it. If an arch has removed its definition of 
CONFIG_ZONE_DMA then __GFP_DMA will be ignored in the page allocator.

I think we agree on a lot more. Hopefully when we meet at lunch today we 
can sync some more.
