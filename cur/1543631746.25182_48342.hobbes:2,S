Resync against 2.5.18, and go through the pending patches folder.
Mostly compilation fixes, but a handful of useful bits too.
A lot of the pending stuff doesn't apply any more, so it may
take a while for me to get around to applying. (ie, resending
resynced versions of patches you sent me may be quicker)
As usual,..
Patch against 2.5.18 vanilla is available from:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davej/patches/2.5/
Merged patch archive: 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/patches/merged/
Check 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/Linux-2.5.html
 before reporting
known bugs that are also in mainline.
