Subject: 2.6.22-rc3-mm1: __attribute__((weak)) considered harmful

statistics-infrastructure-make-printk_clock-a-generic-kernel-wide-nsec-resolution.patch 
shows why __attribute__((weak)) is harmful because you don't see if a 
required non-weak implemtation is missing:
In this case, the weak printk_clock() was renamed to timestamp_clock(), 
but the ARM and i386 implementations weren't renamed...
