Hi folks,
It seems that 2.3.28 contains an unfortunate patch for ide-cd that
disables packets commands sending data to the drive. This means that
CD audio and the DVD stuff will definately not work.
If you are seeing problems where the logs contains messages about the
drive wanting to transfer data the wrong way, please apply.
