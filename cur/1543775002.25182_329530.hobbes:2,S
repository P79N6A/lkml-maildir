Can you explain how this memory is "secure", and how you expect a kernel that's
running *outside* this secure space to load a program into it?

It's more complicated than that - not only do you need to worry about running
the program in that space, you also need to worry about things like malloc()
space for the program, I/O buffers, and so on.....
