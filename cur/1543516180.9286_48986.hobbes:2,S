I use this special trick in my patch
http://www.multimania.com/lch/projects/linux/downloads/i386/
  41k patch-2.3.25-1999.11.07.gz
#ifdef ...
   lcall 0x200 + bootsect_kludge /* in setup.S */
...
As I wrote in the source file this use less memory, but if SETUPSEG change it 
will cause some trouble ...
