As I reported earlier, going to the Git kernel did not really change the
number of invocations of the idle notifier. I was very puzzled by this, so I
chased it some more.
I finally found the culprit for this. The current code is wrong for the
simple reason that the cpu_idle() function is NOT always the lowest level
idle loop function. For enter_idle()/__exit_idle() to work correctly they
must be placed in the lowest-level idle loop. The cpu_idle() eventually ends
up in the idle() function, but this one may have a loop in it! This is the
case when idle()=cpu_default_idle() and idle()=poll_idle(), for instance. 
The reason why the idle notifier was called so few times, even though we had
the right number of interrupts, is simply because we were not getting out of
the idle() function. So I can, indeed, confirm that an interrupt in HLT
instruction gets you out, but HLT is in a loop from which you do not get out
unless you need to reschedule. By moving enter_idle()/__exit_idle() to
cpu_default_idle() I got the right number of calls for the idle notifier.
I see two solutions to this:
	- move enter_idle()/__exit_idle() to the actual lowest-level loop,
	  in cpu_default_idle() and not in cpu_idle(). We would also have
	  to do something similar to poll_idle(), or any similar idle function
	  which contains a loop.
	- add exit_idle() to all the local interrupt handlers, like my
	  initial patch was doing and leave the ente_idle()/__exit_idle()
	  where they are today.
