So basically /dev/sda* have major of scsi, and /dev/evms/sda* have major
of evms, and you end up using the wrong nodes?  This sounds more like
a udev-ruleset problem (not something that will be easy to get right
with a generic one I imagine), rather than anything remotely to do with
ramfs.  If you changed the scripts to use tmpfs rather, you would have
gotten the same result.
Now I do not know evms, so you are on your own there, but here is my
rules for dm and a similar issue:
---------
nosferatu linux-2.6-bk # cat /etc/udev/rules.d/30-sda.rules
KERNEL="sda[0-9]*", NAME=""
nosferatu linux-2.6-bk # cat /etc/udev/rules.d/40-dm.rules
KERNEL="dm-[0-9]*", PROGRAM="/sbin/devmap_name %M %m", NAME="mapper/%c", SYMLINK="%c"
nosferatu linux-2.6-bk #
---------
(note that they should be before all the others if you only have one
rule file)
So basically for the real scsi devices (you could add a BUS="scsi" to
make sure I guess) matching 'sda[0-9]*' no node will be created, and I
get my /dev/mapper/* nodes, with a symlink in /dev/ making things
easier.
you could have a rule catching all evms devices, and then add
the /dev/sda* symlinks, perhaps like so:
--------
KERNEL="evms/sda[0-9]*", SYMLINK="sda%n"
--------
Note that I do not know if a rule was needed to get the nodes in
/dev/evms/ in the first place (due to my admitted lack of evms knowledge
above), so you might have to modify an existing rule ...
