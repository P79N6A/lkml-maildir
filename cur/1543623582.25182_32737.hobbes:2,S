Why do you want to vmalloc() memory in the scsi driver?

use vmalloc_32(), this one returns lowmem.

This is illegal because addr is a kernel _virtual_ address.  You have to
get the page using vmalloc_to_page() and feed this to pci_map_page()
then.  With nbytes > PAGE_SIZE you probably want to build a scatterlist
and use pci_map_sg().
