Hi-
I am trying to use a quad Opteron motherboard with SMP Kernel 2.6.5 for a quasi-real-time task.
I need to assign all processes to specific CPUs, including interrupt handlers.
I have had success using sched_setaffinity() to set the CPU for processes I create, but I am unable,
as root, to force system processes to move to another CPU.  Any ideas?
I can find no documentation about how to force an interrupt handler to a specific CPU - is this
possible without modifying the kernel?
