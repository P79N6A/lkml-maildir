Which will break far more controllers and drives than it fixes, so
backing it out is nonsensical and not in the general good.

Great, make everyone else wait another three months for a working CD
drive. The one off regression appears far less harmful than a revert.
Tejun - instead of backing out important updates for 2.6.24 we should
just blacklist that specific drive for now and sort it nicely in 2.6.25,
not revert stuff and break everyone elses ATAPI devices.
