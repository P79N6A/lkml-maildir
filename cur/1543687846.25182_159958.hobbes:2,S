I don't recall seeing the ACPI disabled line, but mine had the same 
problem halting between PS/2 init and serio.  The change I noticed was 
that IRQ's were being allocated differently, and that is what I 
attributed this failure to.  My motherboard worked with 2.6.0-test3-mm2, 
but has not worked since 2.6.0-test3-mm3 (when the new ACPI code was 
added). 
I'll have to try this acpi=force and pci=noacpi, otherwise I have to 
disable USB and sound to get it to boot.
