It's a matter of time balance. It takes a short time to send the output
of a script, and it takes a very long time to explain how things work.
I often encounter the same situation with haproxy. People ask me to
explain them in detail how this or that would apply to their context, and
it's often easier for me to provide them with a 5-lines patch to add the
feature they need, than to spend half an hour explaining why and how it
would badly behave.

I know that Ingo tends to reply to a question with another question. But
as I said, imagine if he has to explain the same things to each person
who asks him for it. I think that a more constructive approach would be
to point what is missing/unclear/inexact in the doc so that he adds some
paragraphs for you and everyone else. If you need this information to debug,
most likely other people will need it too.

generally, problems that appear only on one person's side and which suddenly
disappear are either caused by some random buggy patch left in the tree (not
your case it seems), or by an obscure bug of the feature being tested which
will resurface from time to time as long as it's not identified.
