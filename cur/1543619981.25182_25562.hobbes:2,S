I argue, for reiserfs:
For O_DIRECT writes, the preferred behavior is to write disk blocks
obtained through the normal methods (get_block, etc.), and fully support
inodes for which file tails do not exist.
For O_DIRECT reads, if the data is determined to be in a file tail,
->direct_IO should either (a) fail or (b) dump the file tail to a normal
disk block before performing ->direct_IO.
