    [XFS] fix unaligned access in readdir
    
    This patch should fix the issue seen on Alpha with unaligned accesses in
    the new readdir code. By aligning each dirent to sizeof(u64) we'll avoid
    unaligned accesses. To make doubly sure we're not hitting problems also
    rearrange struct hack_dirent to avoid holes.
