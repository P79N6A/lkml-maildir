Note that there are more factors at play than raw cpu speed in a
kernel compile. Your time here is slightly faster than my 2.8Ghz P4-HT for
example.  My guess is you have faster disk(s) than I do, as most of
the time mine seems to be waiting for something to do.
*note also that this is compiling stock 2.4.20 with default configuration.
The minute you change any options, we're comparings apples to oranges.
