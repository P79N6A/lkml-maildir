Hi,
I just ported LTTng to the 2.6.29-rc3 kernel. It includes the following
changes :
- Tree RCU instrumentation
- Updated ext4 and jbd2 instrumentation
Please feel free to try it and report any success/problem you may have.
Note that cross-build has been slightly less tested this time because
I'll have to upgrade many of my compilers to a version compatible with
kernel 2.6.29-rc.
It also includes the recently added kprobes support through a simple
echo symbol_name > /mnt/debugfs/ltt/kprobes/enable
It's available at the new LTTng website :
http://www.lttng.org/
Thanks,
Mathieu
