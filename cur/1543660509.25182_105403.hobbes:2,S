They were both set to master.  The enclosure itself doesn't have any
jumpers really, but I changed the jumpers around on the dvd drive (after
receiving your email) and tested various combinations (ie: master,
slave, cable select, and the DMA jumper on/off.)  None of these worked.
Some other stuff I played with:  I noticed that the drive locks shut
with the 'busy' light on.  but:
- drive not connected to enclosure: eject works, busy light off
- drive connected to enclosure, but enclosure not plugged into firewire
bus (ie: controller card): eject doesn't work, busy light on
- connected, on the bus, ohci1394 module not loaded: eject works, busy
light off
- connected, on bus, ohci1394 loaded: eject doesn't work, busy light on
Also, transitioning from one of the 'working' states to one of the
non-working states doesn't work (ie: the unloading the ohci1394
driver.)  The drive gets "stuck" in it's busy-not-working state until
you powercycle the enclosure.
Is it possible that my enclosure just doesn't support DVD drives?
Thanks again
