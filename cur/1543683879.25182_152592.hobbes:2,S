That would be a good thing.  To clarify, there are typically two buffers 
involved:
  - A short DMA buffer
  - A longer buffer into which the audio process generates samples
There are several cycles through the short buffer for each cycle through the 
long buffer.  On one of these cycles, the contents of the long buffer will 
drop below some threshold and the refill process should be scheduled, 
according to your suggestion.  Developing a sane API for that seems a little 
challenging.  Somebody should just hack this and demonstrate the benefit.
In the meantime, the SCHED_SOFTRR proposal provides a way of closely 
approximating the above behaviour without being intrusive or 
application-specific.

Daniel
