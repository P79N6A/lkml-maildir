Actually, based on my understanding of Title 17 and the GPL (both of which 
I just re-read), David *almost* has a point.
1.  As David implies, Title 17 does not grant the copyright holder the 
right to restrict distribution of derived works.  Section 106[1] describes 
the exclusive rights granted to copyright holders, and it only says that 
they have exclusive rights to *prepare* derived works.  So you cannot 
create a derived work without permission from the copyright holder, but 
once you have obtained permission to create it, you can distribute the 
result.  Maybe.
2.  The copyright holder can grant permission to create derived works to 
whomever (s)he likes, under whatever terms (s)he likes (modulo other 
laws).  So, the copyright holder can attach strings to the permission.  
For example, the copyright holder could specify that you are allowed to 
create a derived work, but only on the condition that you do not 
distribute it.
3.  The GPL understands points 1 and 2, which is why section 2 of the GPL 
states:
	You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
	portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program,
	and copy and distribute such modifications or work under
	the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet
	all of these conditions:
It then lists three conditions, the most important of which is the second, 
which states that if the derived work is distributed, it must be 
distributed under the terms of the GPL.
IANAL, but the language in Title 17 and the GPL seems pretty clear.  If 
someone creates a derived work and distributes it under any terms other 
than the GPL, they have violated the agreement which gave them permission 
to create the derived work, and thereby infringed on the copyright 
holder's exclusive rights.
So, yeah, you *do* have the right to restrict distribution of derived 
works, via a thunk in the GPL.
Oh, IANAL.
	Shawn.
