Jarek,
This patch is verified crap!

PS: Olaf,
You've written earlier that one of the main reasons for poll_napi is
to work when the kernel "doesn't even service softirqs anymore". But
in your patch poll_napi leaves netif_rx_complete for softirqs, so
even if it starts to work for Ingo in normal conditions, probably
something else is needed, anyway.
