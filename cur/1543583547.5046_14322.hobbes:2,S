There is another small bug with the loop over loop problem. Now it works
fine for
files but not for Devices:
losetup /dev/loop0 /dev/sr1
losetup /dev/loop1 /dev/loop0
dd if=/dev/loop1 of=test.dat bs=2048 count=1024
Makes dd hang. (BTW: /dev/sr1 is a CD-ROM)
Tried the same on /dev/hda1, /dev/sda1 with 2.4.2-ac7-your_patch and
with 2.4.2-ac8.
BTW: Did extensiv testing with and without the crypto patches. And all
other tests worked fine! :-)
