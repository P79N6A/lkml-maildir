Hi Lee,
Be warned. This driver is in the early stages of development. There is 
still a lot of work that needs to be done (interrupt, dma, etc, etc).
You can untar it in the linux/sound directory (it will overwrite the 
Kconfig and Makefile) and it will build (you will need to modify the 
arch/....../kernel/ksyms.c to resolve the undefined symbols, see my 
previous email). It won't do anything useful yet. Please let me know if 
you have any questions.
Thanks,
Carlos Munoz
