Hi Thomas.

The 486 doesn't even have an 80x25 mode, it's either 80x43 or 80x60
only, no other modes are supported on its LCD screen. Linux deals
with it without any problems, and I don't provide any special options
to select that mode either. I have the BIOS set up in what it calls
"Long Screen Mode", which gives the 80x60 display.

In my case, all machines boot under LILO and are fine, so can I assume
that he's using some other boot loader? If so, I would have to suspect
a problem with the boot loader, not the kernel...
Best wishes from Riley.
