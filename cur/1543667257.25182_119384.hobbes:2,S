Hi All,
mm/swapfile.c seems to have three potential races.
The first two are in 
        linux-2.5.62/mm/swap_state.c:87:add_to_swap_cache
which seems reachable without a lock from the callchain:
        mm/swapfile.c:sys_swapoff:998->
              sys_swapoff:1026->
                try_to_unuse:591->
                        mm/swap_state.c:read_swap_cache_async:377->
                            add_to_swap_cache
add_to_swap_cache increments two global variables without a lock:
        INC_CACHE_INFO(add_total);
and
        INC_CACHE_INFO(exist_race);
The final one is in
        linux-2.5.62/mm/swapfile.c:213:swap_entry_free
which seems to increment
        nr_swap_pages++;
without a lock.
Are these real races?  Or are these just stats variables?  (Or is
there some implicit locking that protects these?)
Regards,
Dawson
