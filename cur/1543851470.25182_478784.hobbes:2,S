I don't remember who suggested "online/offline", and I don't remember
you suggesting "change", but my memory isn't what it used to be(*), so you
probably did.
Is there some document somewhere that explains exactly what each of
the kobject_actions are meant to mean and how they can be
interpreted?
Anyway, I am happy to change it.  What exactly do you want?
KOBJ_CHANGE both when the array is activated and when it is
deactivated?  Or only when it is activated?
Should ONLINE and OFFLINE remain and CHANGE be added, or should they
go away?
If they remain, should CHANGE come before or after ONLINE (and
OFFLINE)?
I must admit that it feels more like an ONLINE/OFFLINE event than a
CHANGE event to me, but they are just words after all.
What does udev/HAL do with ONLINE/OFFLINE?  Could it be changed to do
"the right thing" for ONLINE? (Not implying that it should be, just
wanting to understand as much of the picture as possible).
Thanks,
NeilBrown
(*) At least I think it isn't what it used to be, but I cannot
remember what it used to be, so I'm not sure :-)
