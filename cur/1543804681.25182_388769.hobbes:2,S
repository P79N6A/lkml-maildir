I think you can do that by specifying an output operand that you
never use in your assembler code, e.g. changing this:
|       __asm__ __volatile__( "lock ; "
|               "btsl %1,%0"
|               :"=m" (ADDR)
|               :"Ir" (nr));
to this:
| #define LONGBITS (8 * sizeof(unsigned long))
|
|       __asm__ __volatile__( "lock ; "
|               "btsl %2,%1"
|               :"=m"(*(&ADDR + nr/LONGBITS))
|               :"m" (ADDR), "Ir" (nr));
fixes my example program by telling the compiler what memory location
is altered.  (Note that %0 is never used inside the asm code.)
So iff 'nr' is a constant you can clobber specific memory locations.
