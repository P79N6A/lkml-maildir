Problem solved:
The original installation, Slackware, uses "/vmlinuz". The kernel build
uses "/boot/vmlinuz" and the original lilo.config without checking to see
if there is a "/boot/vmlinuz" in it. Thus on reboot the system is trying 
to match the old kernel with the new modules.
A warning message would have been nice.
Thanks, all, for the help.
