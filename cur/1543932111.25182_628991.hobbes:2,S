Distributed storage.
I'm pleased to announce the 12'th release of the distributed
storage subsystem (DST).
DST allows to form a storage on top of local and remote nodes
and combine them into linear or mirroring setup, which in
turn can be exported to remote nodes.
Short changelog:
 * new improved mirroring algorithm.
	This algorithm uses sliding window approach for full resync
	and write log for partial resync.
 * fixed number of typos and debug cleanups
 * update inode size when linear algorithm changes the size of the
	storage in run time
 * extended number of sysfs files and documentation for them
 * fixed leak in local export node setup
 * name is 'Dancing with the smoked neutrino' now
Overall list of features of the DST can be found on project's homepage:
http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/old/?section=projects&item=dst
DST is also exported as a git tree available for clone and pull from
http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/archive/dst/dst.git
Interested reader can test DST with 2.6.23 tree too
(it should compile fine, but was not tested).
DST passed all FS tests in LTP with XFS (modulo MAX_LOCK_DEPTH too low bug:
[ 8398.605691] BUG: MAX_LOCK_DEPTH too low!
[ 8398.609641] turning off the locking correctness validator.
this is not DST problem though), but it was not performed with
offline/online nodes.
Thank you.
