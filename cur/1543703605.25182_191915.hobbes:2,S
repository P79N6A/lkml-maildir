Chuck did a study of that particular issue some 2-3 years ago, but we've
addressed all the top problems on his list since then. Do you have any
new numbers to show us? I ask because I'm not at all convinced that the
BKL adds significantly to our latencies for the moment (I've been
looking at those number in the last few days due to the readahead
problems that have already been reported).
I am, however, quite convinced that we need new statistics on this sort
of issue. Chuck is therefore working on a set of patches to add an
"iostat"-like tool to the NFS client. Hopefully that will help settle
these questions.
Cheers,
  Trond
