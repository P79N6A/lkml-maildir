I've been thinking about the discussions on latency, especially in
regards to multilmedia recording, etc. If I/O were prioritized in the
way that CPU utilization is, then this would allow R/T processes to also
take precendence for I/O, thus reducing latency. In addition, this
yields all sorts of benefits for time sensitive I/O.
Any thoughts? Opinions? Etc.?
