I rebased and added a splice_direct_to_actor() helper that nfsd can then
use. This makes the nfsd diff look like the below, which I think you'll
agree is a lot more pleasant. You can view the tree here:
http://git.kernel.dk/?p=linux-2.6-block.git;a=shortlog;h=splice
The vmsplice patch probably needs to be split in two, for now it is the
one introducing the framework that nfsd (and next, loop) can use.
