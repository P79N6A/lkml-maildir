I don't agree. I did a few more cleanups after Andi expressed concerns over 
globals kgdb_memerr and debugger_memerr_expected.
I liked Pavel's approach. Let's first get a minimal kgdb stub into mainline 
kernel. Even this much is going to involve some effort. We can merge other 
features later.
Let's create a cvs tree at kgdb.sourceforge.net for kgdb components to be 
pushed int mainline kernel. This split is to keep current kgdb unaffected. 
People who are already using it won't be affected.
May I suggest we breakup this task into following tasklets. I have expanded 
item 1 because Pavel has something that's already close. The rest of the 
items can be discussed in detail later. These need not be done in this order 
except for first 2 whose sequence is fixed.
1. A minimal kgdb stub
  core.patch: 
    kgdbstub.c full.
    No changes to module.c 
    No changes for CONFIG_KGDB_THREAD
    No changes to calling convention of do_IRQ (Needs to be done)
    CONFIG_KGDB_CONSOLE removed
  i386.patch
    No changes for CONFIG_KGDB_THREAD
    No manipulation of kernel stack before entry into do_IRQ
    No non-source level CFI directives.
2. Minimal x86_64.patch 
3. Patch to sync ppc kgdb with arch independent stub
4. Patch to sync other architecture kgdbs with arch independent stub on help 
from maintainers of those architectures.
5. KGDB_CONSOLE patch
   This is a must for embedded boards that have only one serial port
6. gdb automatic module loading
7. CONFIG_KGDB_THREAD patch
   This may or may not be a separate config option. This patch will include 
x86_64 support required to enable threads.
8. i386 thread support
9. Ethernet interface based on netconsole
10. ... Any other features
