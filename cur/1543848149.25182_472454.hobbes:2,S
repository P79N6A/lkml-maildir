I have to say I always forget its there, debug and fix it only to find
its in hotfixes, grr.  So having the test system notice and fire new
jobs off with these too is the Right Thing (tm).
I've hopefully modified the test system to take hot-fixes into account.
  I do wonder if there should be a series file in this directory, as we
have no ordering otherwise and it would simplify the detection and
application of these patches at my end for sure.
Anyhow, hopefully we'll get some results in the next 4 hours out to TKO
and see how it looks ... assuming they don't all go "what patch, boom,
crash".
