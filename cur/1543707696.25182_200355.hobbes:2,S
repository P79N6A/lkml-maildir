Hrm... so if the USB device drivers are actually doing the dma mapping
themselves, it make sense for them to pass their own struct device, no ?
Or do they have always to pass their host controller one ?
In the former case, we need that inheritance stuff. In the later case
we don't. At this point, it's pretty much a matter of policy.
