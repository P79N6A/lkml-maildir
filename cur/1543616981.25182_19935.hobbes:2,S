this change is incredibly broken on SMP - eg. what protects 'prev' from
being executed on another CPU prematurely. It's even broken on UP:
interrupt context that changes current->need_resched needs to be aware of
nonatomic context switches. See my previous mail.

we can remove the barrier(), but for a different reason: the asm volatile
definition of the switch_to macro is a compilation barrier in itself
already. I've removed the barrier() from my tree, the change will be in
the -H8 patch. The rq = this_rq() reload is still necessery.
