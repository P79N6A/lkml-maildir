I leave mine at the 1G settings, it gives me 960MB instead of 1024M but
avoids all the potential problems that show up with himem.
there are still a lot of potential problems with himem (see linus' post
last week about the pitfalls of locking memory on himem machines in the
wrong zone for one example)
those potential problems are worth dealing with if you really do need a
lot of ram, but the difference between 960M and 1024M doesn't seem like
enough benifit to be worth it. If you really need every bit of your ram
you should not be running X and should shut down a LOT of the default
services, if you haven't gone through and optimized your system you can
probably free up more then 64M of ram that way.
