Hi,
Here are a few driver core and sysfs patches and fixes for 2.6.10-rc1.
They fix some minor bugs in sysfs, add some more environment variables
to /sbin/hotplug to make userspace easier, and shrink the size of struct
device.
Please pull from:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/driver-2.6
thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
