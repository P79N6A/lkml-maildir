Its actually bit more complex. There are 3 methods:
shutdown: save state in linux, then tell bios to powerdown
platform: save state in linux, then tell bios to powerdown and blink
	  "suspended led"
firmware: tell bios to save state itself
"platform" is actually right thing to do, but "shutdown" is most
reliable.
Old code always did "shutdown". New code does "shutdown", "platform"
or "firmware" depending on what BIOS can do.

I believe "platform" is so unreliable (for now) that it blocks usefull
testing... I'd like it to default to "shutdown" when it is merged
upstream.
