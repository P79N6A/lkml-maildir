I was working on a patch for this but now I've lost interest.
Detach should be an attribute off from /dev/console. /dev/console is
using the standard device support and appears at
/sys/class/tty/console so /sys/class/tty/console/detach can be added
as an attribute. /sys/class/tty/console could have another attribute
which lists the available drivers. One solution would be for the
attribute to list the names of the available drivers that have
registered with console and then copy one of those names back to the
attribute to select where console is bound.
In my opinion attach/detach does not belong as an attribute on fbcon,
it is part of /dev/console. The fact that fbcon has to ask console to
unbind from it implies these attributes are in the wrong place.
