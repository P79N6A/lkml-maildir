Doug,
I thought that might do it, it does seem to work.  I edited the driver 
line in my xorg.conf
from nvidia to nv and then,
<alt><ctrl> F1
login as root
/etc/init.d/gdm stop
/etc/init.d/gdm start
It came back up with the same flashing crap on the second monitor, so I 
did it again with
the 2nd monitor turned off altogether, and I'll see how long it will run 
on the single monitor
without the nvidia driver without crashing (maybe forever...).
Thanks,
Scott
