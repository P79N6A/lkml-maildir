Not exactly: my fault to not including previous mails, but basically I've two 
different devices: one driven by sata_sil, the other by piix.

In this dmesg, the kernel finds only the second device, and assigns the

detected so the kernel is searching the "/" filesystem where it cannot be 
found.
here the relevant part of lspci output:
