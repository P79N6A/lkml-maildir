Hey guys
  Im seeing some freezing up of the eepro NIC driver in 2.2.13 on a dual
P3 500 (Supermicro P6DGU motherboard)
Linux version 2.2.13 (root@walken) (gcc version 2.95.2 19991024
(release)) #1 SMP Fri Oct 29 19:18:42 /etc/localtime 1999
It works most of the time, but if I leave a ping running I lose quite a
few packets with little or no system activity.  I have not tried any other
kernel versions but I didnt notice it happening before I recompiled with
SMP support so I suspect thats related.  It may freeze for up to a minute
or two at a time and then just continue working.  Nothing else seems to be
frozen during these periods as far as I can tell.  Thanks
	Dave O
