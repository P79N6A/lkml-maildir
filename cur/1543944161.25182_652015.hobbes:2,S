Yes, that I realize now (I'll refer back to the lack of sleep thing

2.6.24.2 seems to fix the issue, so thanks to whoever noticed and fixed
that (and if no one fixed anything, then I'm just a raving loon, and you
can move on with your day, content that the nice man raving about
fictitious bugs is happy again).
But FYI and for what its worth, although SELinux was compiled, it isn't
being used. Its disabled on boot.
Thanks for the reply and help anyways,
Nick
