It is not so much selling, in my view, as putting in context.
If one can simply explain to others what is before them, so
that they can quickly understand its purposes, scope, architecture,
limitations, alternatives, and such, then others can quickly
evaluate what it is, and whether such seems like a good idea.
It doesn't necessarily mean they buy it any quicker.  Sometimes it
just means it gets shot down quicker ;).  That's ok.
There's a _lot_ of stuff that flows by here ... be gentle and
helpfully informative to the poor reader ... as best you can.
