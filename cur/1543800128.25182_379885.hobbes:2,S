I'd formulate it the other way round as Andrew:
We should force gcc to inline code where we do know best
("static inline"s in header files) and leave the decision
to gcc in the cases where gcc should know best controlled
by some high-level knobs like -Os/-O2.
gcc simply needs to be forced to inline in some cases in which we really 
need inlining, but in all other cases gcc knows best and we can trust 
gcc to make the right decision.
