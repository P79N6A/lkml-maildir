I have cc'ed both Pierre and Alex, but my first message was blocked
by the list as it contained html.
For inlinning, this is my first kernel patch. I have just followed
http://www.tux.org/lkml/#s2-2.

Once again it was an advise from 
http://www.tux.org/lkml/#s1-10.

Somewhere in 0.5-0.6 version this driver has issues with timeouts , 
which were
revealing in a non-debug kernel builds only . So this was a nessecity. I 
will purge
them now.

This is done intentionally to prevent a race condition when a card is 
removed
and immediately reinserted. There may be a more complicated way to solve 
this
issue, but didn't think about them. This only happens when an MMC/SD 
card is
inserted/removed. And it takes at least as long to process the event in 
other
parts of subsystem.

This is taken as is from [tifm_sd]. I suppose this relates to a hardware
limitation:
+	mmc->max_hw_segs = 1;
+	mmc->max_phys_segs = 1;
