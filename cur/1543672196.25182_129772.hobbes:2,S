Hi,
I am unable to record a cd in 2.5.68-mm4 and 2.5.69-mm1 but it works in
2.5.68-mm2 and 2.5.69. So it might have broken in -mm3 but I did not try
it. I am also backing out the dev_t from the -mm kernels. The problem is
cdrecord is unable to find the drive or at least a 'cdrecord
-dev=/dev/hdc -inq' hangs for a while and then only comes up with some
other, 'FAKE' ide drive, that doesn't work. This is using cdrecord
version 2.0 on a UP x86 box with preempt.
ide1: BM-DMA at 0xc008-0xc00f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
hdc: LG CD-RW CED-8120B, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
hdc: ATAPI 32X CD-ROM CD-R/RW drive, 8192kB Cache, DMA
and it is plugged in here..

I tried a few different versions of cdrtools, and they were the same.
