I have been trying recently to compile a Linux kernel on a Sequent machine
under Dynix/Ptx and had a number of issues when I would run 'make dep' where
it would fail because the test command in /bin/sh does not support the -ot
option. I have only had this problem when compiling the linux kernel and I
was able to solve the problem by adding the following line to all the
Makefiles in the source:
   SHELL := <location of bash>
I realize that under linux the /bin/sh is linked to /bin/bash but that is
not always the case and the -ot option for test is not necessarily available
in /bin/sh. Would it be possible in the future to modify the makefiles or
find another way to make sure that make is using bash when it needs bash
instead of whatever the system is using for /bin/sh. I imagine something
like
   SHELL := $BASH
would work. Thanks for all the good work you guys do.
