And like many things on the web, it is wrong.  Do not put anything in
the source code expect #include <linux/module.h> as the first include.
In particular do not include modversions.h yourself, it will break in
2.5.  You compile a module with these gcc flags
(1) -DMODULE
(2) -DMODVERSIONS -include $(TOPDIR)/include/linux/modversions.h
(3) -DEXPORT_SYMTAB
All modules get flag (1).
All modules get flags (2) but only if .config contains
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS, otherwise omit these flags.
Only modules that export symbols get flag (3).
That is what the standard kernel Makefiles do and is the only correct
way to compile modules.
