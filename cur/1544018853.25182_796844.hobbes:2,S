To summarise, using a modalias pairing is good for two reasons: kernel
dependancies are explicit in the kernel and things will just work;
and standard blacklisting of the module will now work.  Module alias
triggers cannot be actual module names else the latter will not work.
But we also do not want to expose the current type number information
to prevent it becoming part of the ABI.  The aliases should be of the
form <subsystem>:<hints>.
I note that we already are exposing the type as text and the card name
in the ABI already exposed as MMC_TYPE and MMC_NAME.  How about I switch
the alias to the textual types, as those are already in the ABI.  Using
the usb model something like this:
	mmc:tMMC
	mmc:tSD
	mmc:tSDIO
	mmc:tUNKNOWN
This with a view to it being extended in the same manner, say we wanted
to expose the name here too (which is also in the ABI, I am not
proposing to add it):
	mmc:tMMCn<name>
Would that satisfy everyone?  I will respin the patches which will be
somewhat simpler as a result.
