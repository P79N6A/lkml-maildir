Well, that IS the heart of the matter, really.  Detecting geometry was only
a means to the end of predicting seek time and rotational latency.  If you
could magically predict the seek time between any two accesses, then you
could sort your queue optimally.  What would be able to do that?  A neural
net?  :)  What would be able to do that without a lot of training time?
Personally, I've been excited about AS, and I would hate to see it not get
in.
