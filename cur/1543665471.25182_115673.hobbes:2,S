The case where while probe() is called, the module is unloaded.
Same thing for remove().
That's all.

Sure, but that's not the case of what we are protecting here.  We want
pci_unregister_driver() (which is usually called from the module_exit()
function), to not be called if we are in the middle of calling either
probe() or release().
Do you have a way of protecting the race that is described by Russell
here that differs from my patch?
