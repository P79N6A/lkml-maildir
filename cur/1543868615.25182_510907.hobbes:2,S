As linux becomes popular, there will always be some people looking
at it that find that it don't fit them perfectly.  That don't mean
we have to make sure linux fits them too - they may be better off
with something else, or we may be better off without them.
Linux has a price - you can use it compeltely free but we want
any useful changes you might make. If everybody sat on their stuff,
linux wouldn't be useful to you today.
There are embedded developers who don't have a problem with
writing GPL drivers.  And there are embedded developers who
don't need any special hardware driver.  No _kernel_ change,
no open-sourcing of company code.  It was never a problem, and
will never be a problem, to run proprietary user processes "apps"
on a linux kernel.
If you have a need for "secret" source code, stuff most of it
in userspace.  Make the drivers truly minimal; perhaps their
open/closed status won't matter that much when the bulk
of the code and the cleverness is kept safe in userspace.
Note that keeping drivers small this way is the recommended
way of working anyway. It isn't merely a way to keep your
code away from the GPL - you always want a small kernel.
