Here's how to use Bugzilla to track regressions between different
kernel versions:
Create a 2.6.22 regression bug and a 2.6.23 regression bug. All
regression bugs which are 2.6.22 regression bugs should block the
2.6.22 regression bug. All regression bugs which are 2.6.23 regression
bugs should block the 2.6.23 regression bug.
For example, say your master 2.6.22 regression bug tracking bug is #1.
When someone comes and files a new bug #2 which is a regression of
2.6.22, make bug #2 block bug #1. Then it is easy to see to track all
the 2.6.22 regressions.
To make it easier to remember what bug number tracks regressions for a
specific kernel, use a naming convention to create aliases for those
bugs.
