   Of course we do, and then we don't map it into user address space;
   if it ever gets mapped into user address space later, do_no_page
   does the flush_page_to_ram then.
You miss the fact that if we do an early COW and another process
recently WROTE into that page via a shared MMAP, we will potentially
copy old data into the COW page we use for the current process.
Your changes are wrong and will cause corruption.
