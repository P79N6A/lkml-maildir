Forgot to mention. During those tests make sure that imported devices 
from both SCST and STGT report in the kernel log the same write cache 
and FUA capabilities, since they significantly affect initiator's 
behavior. Like:
sd 4:0:0:5: [sdf] Write cache: enabled, read cache: enabled, supports 
DPO and FUA
For SCST the fastest mode is NV_CACHE, refer to its README file for details.
