Oops, I failed to see this is S3.
I can see that device_suspend( ..., SUSPEND_POWER_DOWN) is called with
interrupts disabled. But thats okay: (driver.txt) All calls are made
with interrupts enabled, except for the SUSPEND_POWER_DOWN level.
I fail to see a bug in ACPI code.

I have no idea what is wrong. It works for me...

Yep, and I can't reproduce that :-(.
