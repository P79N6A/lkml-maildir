Well note there are two revisions available now. The original linear design is 
here:
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6/2.6.7-rc2/patch-2.6.7-rc2-am11
and there is an exponential curve bias in this one which will probably 
deprecate the last one:
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6/2.6.7-rc2/patch-2.6.7-rc2-as
I am keen to get more feedback; apart from what I get off list there has been 
very little in the way of reports.
