You are reading the log correctly. There are two bugs. One is that if we
pass X to idr_get_new_above, it can return X again (doesn't ever seem to
return < X). The other problem is that the find fails on 1024 (and 2048
if we skip 1024).

Yes that is the exact scenario. Only 2 id's are used at any given time,
and once we hit 1024 things break. This doesn't happen when the tree is
not empty.
Thanks for looking at this!
