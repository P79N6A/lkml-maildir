Actually I guess I'm wrong here: it appears that it really should
order before, and after the clear_bit, respectively (looking at
its usage in unlock_page.
So ia64's smp_mb__before_clear_bit needs to be a full barrier, but
__after_clear_bit can be a release. I think?
By the way unlock_page is issuing extra barriers:
Documentation/atomic_ops.txt defines test_and_clear_bit operations
to provide full memory barriers before and after them, so no need
for smp_mb__before/after there.
...ia64 gets these test_and_x_bit operations wrong as well...
