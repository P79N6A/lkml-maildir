Ups, your are right:
$ cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/throttling
state count:             2
active state:            T1
states:
    T0:                  00%
   *T1:                  50%
With T0 it get:
$ for i in `seq 5`; do ./port80; sleep 1; done
cycles: out 684, in 280
cycles: out 684, in 280
cycles: out 684, in 280
cycles: out 684, in 280
cycles: out 684, in 280
