The strategy I've been adopting in this case is to simply use unsigned
long long when we need
u64, and print it with llx for both i386 and x86_64. The problem here
is that pgd_val may be 32-bit with non-PAE configs,
IIRC. So maybe we can #define the print string, and put it inside the
ifdefs. Along the lines of printk("pgd: " PGD_STR ...)
For this particular warning, it is in a _64.c file, so the llx may be
able to help.
