Procfs adds 90K to the running footprint of my machine, so I want to run it
as a loadable module using old style /dev when building embedded boxes.
The real disk /dev is the right answer for small machines along with
sysctl without proc.
Devfs looks after the big machine issues better.
Procfs is to a great extent the wrong answer to most of its uses, its more
bloated than sysctl but does little more and its slow.
