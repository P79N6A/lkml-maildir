That's a trivial change to make if you want it. we just add a "reviewed"
/ "certified" state between "new" and "assigned". Yes, might be a good 
idea.  I'm not actually that convinced that "assigned" is overly useful
in the context of open-source, but that's a separate discussion.
I'm hoping to get a discussion going at Kernel Summit / OLS on how 
people want this to evolve, I'll add this one to the list ... thanks.
