Yeah, that would be bad. We probably have flags free, but those page flags 
are always a pain. Scratch that.
How about just setting a per-vma dirty flag, and then instead of updating 
the mtime when taking the dirty-page fault, we just set that flag?
Then, on unmap and msync, we just do
	if (vma->dirty-flag) {
		vma->dirty_flag = 0;
		update_file_times(vma->vm_file);
	}
and be done with it?
