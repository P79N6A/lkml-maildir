It is because you only compiled it with nptl support.
In recent (nptl enabled) Redhat glibc's glibc is build two times.
1) without nptl
2) with nptl
The version without nptl support is then installed into the 'default'
location.  The other is installed into /lib/tls/ and /usr/lib/tls/.
ld.so is then hacked (maybe in mainline glibc now?) to load the tls
enabled versions of the libraries only if the kernel/hardware support
it.
