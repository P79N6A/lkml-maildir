OK, thank you; it has been a struggle to get confirmation of this;
perhaps because the way IOWait is measured has changed at some point?

Ah, I can see that the CPU-intensive command soaks up the cycles that
would otherwise have been reported as IOWaits.
Unfortunately this doesn't help explain why Windows XP on the same box
can complete an "identical" copy operation in half the time. Perhaps
it's just due to the different filesystems, or the way write caching
works?
Thanks,
Gordon.
