Hello,
I have a strange problem with ppp and the 2.3.99-pre1
When I try a connection, I receive this error message:
Mar 19 00:05:16 kelvin pppd[1514]: pppd 2.3.10 started by root, uid 0
Mar 19 00:05:16 kelvin pppd[1514]: Using interface ppp0
Mar 19 00:05:16 kelvin pppd[1514]: Connect: ppp0 <--> /dev/ttyS0
Mar 19 00:05:42 kelvin pppd[1514]: Hangup (SIGHUP)
Mar 19 00:05:44 kelvin pppd[1514]: Terminating on signal 15.
Mar 19 00:05:48 kelvin pppd[1514]: Connection terminated.
Mar 19 00:05:48 kelvin pppd[1514]: tcflush failed: Input/output error
Mar 19 00:05:48 kelvin pppd[1514]: Exit.
I'm using pppd 2.3.10 and with 2.3.51, the same connection works very fine.
My kernel is SMP and I compiled ppp support as module. This is my conf.modules
alias char-major-108 ppp_generic
alias tty-ldisc-3 ppp_async
any idea?
thanks in advance,
Fausto
