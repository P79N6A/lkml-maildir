Ok.
But Herbert, let's take a step back real quick because I want
to point something out.  IPv6 does try to handle the dangling
mismatched idev's, in route.c:ip6_dst_ifdown(), this is called
via net/core/dst.c:dst_ifdown(), and this releases the ipv6
idev correctly in the split device case.
Did your analysis of this bridging release bug take this into
account?  That's why we added this dst->ops method, specifically
to handle this problem.
This was added by Yoshifuji-san in ChangeSet 1.1722.137.17 which
has the checking comment:
[NET]: Add dst->ifdown callback.
Use it to release protocol specific objects that may be
tied to a dst cache object, at ifdown time.  Currently
this is used to release ipv4/ipv6 specific device state.
