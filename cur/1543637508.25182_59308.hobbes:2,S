I recently had an oops on my laptop with a rh kernel with I think this
stuff in (it decoded the trace to symbols, etc).
The only problem was that the machine paniced at the end, with the
register dump off the top of the screen.  The only thing visible was
the trace.
As useful as it was to have the trace, the oops was useless because
the rest of the information was missing.
So why didn't I scroll up?  Because shift-pgup needs a task queue to
run, which doesn't happen after a panic, just like you can't ctrl-alt-del
to reboot (but you can alt-sysrq-b)...
Personally, I'd much rather have the standard oops output and be able
to scribble down the numbers, and then look them up than to have some
snazzy bit of code in the kernel do it for me and scroll the useful
information off the screen.
(And thanks for reminding me about the oops...)
