I don't think that BK should know/recognize format-only changes.
However, it would be nice when using bk revtool, one could be looking
at a few targeted lines of a changeset and then click [Prev Rev][Next Rev]
and see the same lines in previous/next revisions of the file.
And if it already does this, great.  How do I do that?
I know how to left-click rev-A and right-click rev-B to see changes
between them, but then I have to search thru potentially several 100
or 1000 lines of code for the 10 lines that I'm looking for.
(and it would be nice if one could choose to have the lines numbered).
