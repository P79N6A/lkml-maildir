Never mind, my responses are rather sluggish these days too.

I'll have a go at it later.

Well, libata can safely ignore it since scsi takes care of that (see
scsi_run_queue() which is called on command completion).

Some time back, I raised this with Jens in connection with your previous
version of the patchset [1]. I didn't get an answer at the time but
perhaps it would help to raise it again in its own right and to give
some more examples of its potential merits.

Looks alright to me.
