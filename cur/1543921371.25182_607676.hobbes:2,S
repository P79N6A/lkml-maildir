It doesn't. It fails with non-SMP as well.
Rob, your patch works for me. (Not that the reboot into 2.6.23.1 was
problem-free: iproute2-071016 fails to understand the `police' action
and also somehow fails to bring up networking well enough for me to
locally NFS-mount my home directories, where 070710 had no trouble.
More on that soon to the appropriate people as soon as I've diagnosed
it...)
