This bug report is a bit vague in terms of what the problem is -- the 
test case hits 3 major subsystems (io, vm, net), all of which have changed 
rather substantially in the course of 2.6 development.  Would it be possible 
to profile the system using oprofile to get an idea what the hotspots are?  
Have you compared basic hard disk throughput with hdparm, as well as 
ensuring DMA is enabled with 32 bit io?  What about testing network 
performance with netperf (or a netcat of /dev/zero)?  A few more data points 
would be quite helpful.  Cheers,
