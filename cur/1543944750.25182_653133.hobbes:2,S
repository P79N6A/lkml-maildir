I don't think we're likely to see examples of actual code written to do 
this being posted to refute my comment.
I think what you said above is right and that it should be allowed.  
You're advocating for allowing task A to attach to shmem segments created 
by task B while task A has its own mempolicy that restricts its own 
allocations but still being able to access the shmem segments of task B, 
providing that task A will not fault them back in itself.
You're right, that's not a scenario that I was hoping to address to 
MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES.

Ok, I'll clarify the intention in this code that we agreed was better:
	case MPOL_PREFERRED:
		if (!remap) {
			int nid = first_node(pol->user_nodemask);
			if (node_isset(nid, *newmask))
				pol->v.preferred_node = nid;
			else
				pol->v.preferred_node = -1;
		} else
			pol->v.preferred_node = node_remap(pol->v.preferred_node,
							*mpolmask, *newmask);
		break;
