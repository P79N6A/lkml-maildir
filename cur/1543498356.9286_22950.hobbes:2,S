  Yes, and there are some things that make it more complicated, such as
"send multiple requests, then get all answers in sequence" behavior
that is supposed to be supported by HTTP/1.0 (this model has no
high-level flow control, see my previous message).

  What header? Userspace only needs to call accept() and get a file
