BWGROUP(drive)->busy should never reach zero until the reset is
done. The 50mS miught be enough that this occurs, as might waiting
for HWGROUP(drive)->busy hitting 0. I don't yet understand why it
matters, and to fix it properly I have to figure that out.
If you need reliable reset for something like a test harness, or
IDE drive tester its a usable workaround, but I need to fix it
properly (eventually)

In your test set is HWGROUP(drive)->busy always zero after the
mdelay ?
