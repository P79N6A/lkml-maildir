Hi All,,
    I was wondering if I could do the following with linux and if
their was someone doing this currently.
I want to setup a linux box that has 3 network cards in it...one of
the network cards would be assigned a private ip address and the other
two network cards would be assigned a dynamic public ip address by my
upstream adsl provider. What I want to do is load balance between the
two adsl links..is this possible? By Load balancing I want to be able
download items from the internet from a workstation in my private
network using these two "load balanced" adsl lines.
Thanks,
Brent Clements
