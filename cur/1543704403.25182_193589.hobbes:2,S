I'm sorry. Since I had not seen any net driver patches getting into
2.4.25-pre, I assumed you had set your priorities to 2.6. Looking again,
it seems the switch from 2.4.24-pre to 2.4.25-pre confused me and I forgot
to double check with the actual prepatches.

Will coordinate with Manfred so that we don't step on each other's toes
when changing function names.

The chunk above is the only difference between the 2.4 and the 2.6
version. Should I remove the #ifdef or change the line calling
synchronize_irq itself?

You mean it should be removed? AFAICS, we have
#define dprintk(x...)          do { } while (0)
so the compiler _should_ optimize it out if we use at least -O.

No idea. None of us have the hardware available, so we entirely depend on
external testers. We could try to get a sampling by issuing an
unconditional printk instead.

This was a feature many users asked for. It seems broken hardware is very
common for this chipset.

Will take a look at other drivers. Do you have any good example?
