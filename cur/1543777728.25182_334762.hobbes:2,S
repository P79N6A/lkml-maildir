I think the significance of usec values from the non-rt tests makes this an 
inappropriate thing to do. The variation in results will be greater than usec 
resolution.

While I agree with you in principal on getting the rlimit feature working and 
supported, this benchmark is meant to be run in single user mode for most 
reproducible and valid results. However, clearly there will be people using 
it cautiously as a normal user first. I originally did not include the 
information that you need to be root in v.20 and said in the documentation 
"need rt privileges" but within about 5 minutes of posting it I had someone 
not understanding what "unable to get SCHED_FIFO" meant. I guess a more 
verbose message will be required explaining non-root RT as well.
Cheers,
Con
