Big deal !
How can I debug this problem ?
If the kernel has no debug option, modprobe freeze the machine.
If the kernel has debug option, modprobe works correctly and the card works 
perfectly. I compile one kernel and make recursively listing trough nfs
I got 140 millions nfs requests without problem.
I could have kgdb, but it doesn't work. I'm not sure it helps me. I think it's 
a timing problem somewhere in the pci driver.
