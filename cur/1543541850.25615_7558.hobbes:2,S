I am running it for quite a while (at least 6 month) on a little server (468DX2 66 16MB RAM). I is running apache, exim, squid, mysql and nfsd just to name a few. The machine really suffers from the low memory but it does not crash. The
reiserfs partitions are about 20GB total. The performance compared to the ext2
partitions is incredible.
