This doesn't appear to work as a solution because the functionality
changes won't be in all the existing kernel, and also because the kernel
font save has a couple of bugs reported against it with regards to
saving the right data that might need looking at anyway.
It seems it would be neccessary for X to have a way to know whether the
feature is present.
