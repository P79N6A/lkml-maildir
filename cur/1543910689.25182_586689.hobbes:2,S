For example, send_sigio(). We shouldn't send this signal to /sbin/init.
But what if the interrupted process is from the parent namespace?

get_signal_to_deliver() checks SIG_IGN/SIG_DFL, but I guess you meant
a special check for init.
Unless the patch is wrong, this is not needed. And, in fact we can't do
this anyway. Because get_signal_to_deliver() can't know if the signal
comes from parent namespace or not.
