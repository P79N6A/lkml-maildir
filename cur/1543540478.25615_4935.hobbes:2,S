Slowly but surely.   We're doing a deal with NSC and from the start it was Linux
drivers or no deal so they've been slowly turning the gears.  They make a decent
(okay, it's a piece of trash but it's dirt cheap) low-cost integrated chipset that
works fine for small low-power devices.  Echostar (my employer) and at least a few
others have been trying to get them to do Linux.
They even hired Mark Lord to do an IDE DMA driver for them earlier this year.
The big problem with them is that they are a hydra.  There are way too many heads
talking to different people cutting different deals and there isn't a central brain
controlling the show.  They certainly have Linux demand they just need to consolidate
it all together to see the need for them to do something on the corporate level to
support it.
