This might make sense for devices that end in numbers, but does it really
make sense for devices that don't? I don't really see how having
something like randomfb.0 is intuitive, this may make sense for things
like serial8250 where another 0 would be misleading without some form of
delimiter, but those are the corner cases and should be treated as such.
It's a bit irritating to have to constantly update userspace code that is
acting under the false pretense that there is some sort of consistent
naming scheme in place that won't change every time some new corner case
crops up.
(And yes, I should have brought this up when the patch was posted, but I
didn't see it until _after_ being bit by this change).
