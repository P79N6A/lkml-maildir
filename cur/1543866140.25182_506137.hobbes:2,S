Yes, I thought that this was already covered by the existing inheritance
of the private flag from the parent directory.
On a separate note, I believe that the current problem with using
reiserfs and selinux is just that reiserfs hasn't been updated to call
security_inode_init_security() and set the security xattr when creating
a new file; see ext3 or jfs for an example.  But I don't know of anyone
using reiserfs with selinux presently.
