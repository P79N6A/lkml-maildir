The problem with git-commit is who's repo to add the hook to.  I did
attempt to do this by picking up each of linus' main releases and then
using the git blame engine to attribute each "failure" to a particular
commit.  The plan then would be to send a nasty-gram to the committer
about violations there-in.
I'll try and find some time to get this bit polished and at least
emailing me.
