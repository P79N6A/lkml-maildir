     I have two problems that started when I changed a machine from a SCSI
drive to an IDE drive.  Nothing else changed.
     This exists both under 2.2.13 and 2.2.14.
     Machine has an Asus motherboard, Pentium MMX 200mhz, 128MB RAM, and a
IBM-DPTA-372050 drive.
     With the SCSI drive that was previously in the machine, it ran fine, no
problems.  Since putting IDE drive in this system I have two problems. 
     First, when I go to write backups, sometimes dump will just stop.  The ps
flags show SW.  If I interrupt the dump it responds to the keyboard, but if I
tell it not to abort to continue, it just goes back into that state.  I have to
kill it and start all over.  This NEVER did this with the SCSI drive. 
     Second problem, this machine is a mail server and a pretty heavily loaded
server at that.  We have about 500 mail lists served and we are using smartlist
which uses promail, and we get errors that look like this: 
Jan 7 05:29:14 mx1 sendmail[29722]: FAA27266: to=brfuji@gateway.net,
delay=00:11:15, xdelay=00:00:00, mailer=esmtp, relay=a-mx.gateway.net.,
stat=Deferred: Illegal seek
Jan 7 05:34:38 mx1 sendmail[30800]: FAA30788: 
to=Mark@rodwell60.freeserve.co.uk, delay=00:00:29, xdelay=00:00:00,
mailer=esmtp, relay=mail-in.pol.net.uk., stat=Deferred: Illegal seek
Jan 7 05:35:23 mx1 sendmail[30801]: FAA30791: to=mongo88@erols.com,
delay=00:01:14, xdelay=00:00:00, mailer=esmtp, relay=mx.mail.rcn.net.,
stat=Deferred: Illegal seek
     I do not know what is causing the Illegal seek's, I have recompiled
sendmail, recompiled procmail, still the same errors. 
     Again, this behavior didn't start until we switched to IDE drive and then
immediately became a problem.  Same for dump problem.
     Yet, I am not seeing any file system corruption on this drive.  It can run
for weeks, and provided I take it down gracefully it usually fsck's totally
clean.  The machine also very rarely crashes, almost always the result of
operator malfunction, and I haven't seen an OOPS on this box as long as I can
remember. 
     We've seen this behavior with both 2.2.13 and 2.2.14, and it was on 2.2.13
prior to changing from SCSI to IDE, so I don't know how IDE would have behaved
with older OS versions.
