There are quite a few other applications that can benefit from large
page support.  IBM Watson Research published JVM and some scientific
workload results using large pages which showed substantial benefits.
Also, we believe DB2, Domino, other memory piggish apps (e.g. think
scientific) would benefit equally on many architectures.
It would sure be nice if the interface wasn't some kludgey back door
but more integrated with things like mmap() or shm*(), with semantics
and behaviors that were roughly more predictable.  Other than that,
no comments as yet on the patch internals...
