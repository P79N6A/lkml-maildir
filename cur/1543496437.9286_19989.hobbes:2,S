For serious use, that call is junk. It is bad to need to make one system
call per data item. It also doesn't offer the right information.
Think of a call that would be used this way:
__u64 results[3];
const int request[] = {FOO_SESS, FOO_PPID, FOO_CMD};
err = foo(pid,request,results);
if(err) exit(1);
printf("SESS %Ld\n", results[0]);
printf("PPID %Ld\n", results[1]);
printf("CMD  %8.8s\n", &(results[2]));
It is also OK to fill in a union of structs, with each possible struct
containing a set of information that goes well together with the same
sort of locking and security issues.
It is OK to read this information from a /proc/12345/.bindata file,
though that isn't quite as fast.
