btw., it would be really, really cool if there was a scriptable way i 
could test suspend/resume functionality. Pavel has this /dev/rtc thing 
to set up an alarm (not sure how functional it is) - would it be 
possible to have it as a "suspend for 10 seconds then resume" debug 
functionality? That way any suspend breakage would be detectable (and 
bisectable) in automated testing - if the resume does not come back 
after 10-20 seconds then the test failed.
