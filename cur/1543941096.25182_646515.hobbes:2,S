Subject: [PATCH 0/11] fix 25 section mismatch warnings..
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The following set of patches fixes 25 Section mismatch warnings
in following directories:
kernel/
mm/
drivers/pci
arch/x86/
When build individually they are now clean.
The shortlog:
Sam Ravnborg (11):
      pci: fix section mismatch warnings referring to pci_do_scan_bus
      pci: fix 4x section mismatch warnings
      cpu: fix section mismatch warnings for enable_nonboot_cpus
      cpu: fix section mismatch related to cpu_chain
      cpu: do not annotate exported register_cpu_notifier()
      cpu: silence section mismatch warnings for hotcpu notifies
      mm: fix section mismatch warning in sparse.c
      x86: fix section mismatch warning in acpi/boot.c
      x86: silence section mismatch warning in smpboot_64.c
      x86: fix section mismatch warning in kernel/pci-calgary
      x86: fix section mismatch warnings when referencing notifiers
With these patches applied I have a clean build of arch/x86/
with an allyesconfig.
I expect Greg to pick up the pci patches - but as they conflict with
patches recently posted by Adrian a qualified selection should be made.
The cpu patches are cc:ed to Gautham R Shenoy but I think they
need to go in via Andrew.
The mm patch are cc:ed the Mel, Christoph and Andy but I think this one
should also go in via Andrew.
The x86 patches are cc:ed to the x86 gang and should all go in via the x86 tree.
I would like some extra review of the following patches:
-> The pci patches
-> x86: silence section mismatch warning in smpboot_64.c
The others are more strightforward but please eye ball them too.
For my allyesconfig build I still has 116 warnings - but this is without
Adrian's patches applied.
Of these 8 happens only when running the final check on vmlinux.o which
is due to references between the sub directories (kernel/ <-> arch/x86/kernel/)
Patches follows unnumbered as they are independent of each other.
