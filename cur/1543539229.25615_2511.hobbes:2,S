I remember time, not version. I had it applied for few months when someone
said that this problem (/dev/pts/0 is treated the same as /dev/vc/0) is due to
pam stupidity. I answered that pam is innocent - it was not supplied with
enough info to begin with. As result of discussion I've sent patch to
linux-utils maintainers and eventualy it was adopted (much to my surprise
since it looks like a kludge to me).

Yes, I can understood this but problem is that I just not know when it was
done exactly :-(
RG> Also, what was the patch?
Ah. This part I can say for sure:
