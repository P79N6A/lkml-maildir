Hi everyone
I found the AMD bug in AMD-K6-II 3D-Now! (TM) 400Mhz bougt 25.8.1999 in Prague, Czech republic.
Have you anyone found an AMD-K6-II that doesn't contain the bug?
Does K6-II contain it?
Does Athlon contain it?
I think also 2.2+ kernels should be capable of dying on this bug caused by an ordinary user.
I'm trying now to prove it...
