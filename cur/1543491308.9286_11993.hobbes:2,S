	asm("rdtsc %0" : "=A"(start));

Since neither `start' nor `stop' is dependant on `something',
the compiler is justified in scheduling this as
	asm("rdtsc %0" : "=A"(start));
	asm("rdtsc %0" : "=A"(stop));
	something;
or
	something;
	asm("rdtsc %0" : "=A"(start));
	asm("rdtsc %0" : "=A"(stop));
which isn't quite what you wanted. 
Adding the volatile makes the asm act as a scheduling barrier.
