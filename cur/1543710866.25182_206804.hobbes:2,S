Well in that case we'll also act as the "official" prism54 patch
recipients/senders. And by "we" I mean any of the prism54 developers
listed on our project page. We can do this but we can only do this if the
patches are sent to *us* based on clean bk trees. It's important that
patches are sent to *us* prior to inclusion in the kernel since this
driver is not the normal 1-file driver. If a patch goes into the driver
in the kernel tree but not ours it's going to be a pain mantaining our
tree / writing patches for you (as was done just now), specially since
we're still a heavily active driver project. 
So for now then, I'm going to update our CVS repository to match the
kernel tree and we'll soon send you patches with the latest changes.
Please only accept then patches/changes for the driver if its passed through us (if
this is possible). It's not that that we don't want people to contribute
it's just that this is the way it has to be in order to make our live's
easiers as mantainers of the driver.
I'm already subscribed to the netdev list and I'll keep my eyes open for
any wide-kernel changes/patches and apply them too. I'll ask the others
to do the same.
Is this an OK plan?
