Ok, that's fine.

Ok.  My statement still stands though.  Current day open-source
development that is BSD licensed or similarly can go directly to
Microsoft.  Any developers should be well aware of that before
choosing such a license.  I didn't mean to start such a
discussion however, so I won't continue it past this message.
Sorry for the offtopic posting about it.  Any responses should be
via direct mail.
