Ok, what is it that you think ACPI fundamentally changes in this process?
keep in mind that we are not makeing the assumption that the hardware 
will remain powered (even a little bit), or the assumption that nothing 
else will run on the hardware (eliminating any possibility that the 
hardware is in a known ACPI state)
