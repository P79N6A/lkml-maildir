With regards to Linux 2.6, file "drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c", lines 691 and 928.
691         result = kmalloc(256, GFP_ATOMIC |
692                         (host->unchecked_isa_dma) ? __GFP_DMA : 0);
928         lun_data = kmalloc(length, GFP_ATOMIC |
929                            (sdev->host->unchecked_isa_dma ? __GFP_DMA :
0));
In line 691, the evaluation done to fill the priority field for the kmalloc is
ambiguous. If your system does not support the GFP_DMA type, this call will
fail, since it always evaluates true. I imagine that 928 is shows what this 691
should look like.
