We are in gdth_get_info(), somewhere in the long loop.

The function dereferences cmd->device->request_fn.

Ok, I found the problem:
static int gdth_get_info()
{
	[...]
	Scsi_Device sdev;
	[...]
	memset(&sdev,0,sizeof(Scsi_device));
	[...]
	scp.device = &sdev;
	scsi_do_cmd(&scp,...)
}
gdth calls scsi_do_cmd() with an uninitialized Scsi_Device structure!
Unfortunately, I have no idea how to solve it [except killing the /proc
interface], perhaps someone who understands the scsi layer could fix it?

Thanks for your patience!
