Yes, about 25-30 times just now, without any failures... WTH ??

Formerly rh8.0 with almost all updates, eg if its still an rpm, I let 
update do it.  Hand built stuffs like cups and sane are newer than 
8.0, as is the currently working kde-3.1.1a.  Obviously I don't let 
up2date anywhere near that stuff.
On 'verify'ing the glibc install, gnorpm complains about 
/etc/localtime's link status.  Other than that, its clean ANAICT.
