Yes, but that's a class of bugs that are pretty well understood these
days; handing privileged FDs around is a moderately common and
pleasantly fine-grained way of doing things. Closing an FD is at least
as easy as dropping a capability, which is what you'd have to do
with the current scheme upon entering unprivileged code.
Besides, setuid CD-recording tools already have to worry about closing
unsafe FDs when they drop privileges, so this doesn't seem to add any
new security holes...
Thanks,
