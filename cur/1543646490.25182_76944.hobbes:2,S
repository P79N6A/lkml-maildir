Yup - a blatant and outright violation.
Worse - it's also illegal to refuse to do business with someone
based on who their employer is, in most states.
Also - it's an attempt to restrict first-purchase rights. Most courts
have found such clauses to be unenforcable in standard contracts - I doubt
a shrink-wrap license is gonna fare any better.
