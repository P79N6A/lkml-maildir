Hi !
As there were a few security fixes pending and 2.4.34-pre1 has not
received enough validation, I've released 2.4.33.1 with the most
important fixes. All those fixes are already in 2.4.34-pre1.
Particularly important ones are :
 - CVE-2006-1528 : local DoS via direct I/O from the sg driver to mmapped I/O space
   fix from Dann Frazier
 - CVE-2006-4093 : possible local DoS on some PPC970.
   fix from Olof Johansson
Hotfix patches for older versions should follow within a short time.
Regards,
Willy
