I hoped that some kernel guru will take my outline and open a discussion
about how it really should work. I made it from my point of view (HPC
clusters with load arround 1 and possibly high number of context
switches between communicating tasks). But it should be interesting also
for sysadmins with need for correct accounting.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough time to make an SMP version in the
near future. I think, that it should be solved before the patch will go
into kernel tree (another points for discussion: should it go ?, to
which thread ?). Also, it's possible (if I got it right) to use one of
MSRs to count cycles in privileged mode...
I'm contented about how it is working now and I really don't have time
to waste if no one else need it, sorry. If there really IS public need
for this, I would be happy if some guru could take care of it...

PS: If there is no public interest in this topic we can discuss it off
