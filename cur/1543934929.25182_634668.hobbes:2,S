What is an implementation detail and what is not?  In the end,
everything that we configure in Kconfig is implementation details.
PS:
Kill 'select' already, and instead work on better UIs if you have got
trouble with the complexities of the dependencies graph.  The graphic
UIs including menuconfig currently work best for tree-like dependencies,
but the graph isn't a tree.  Think about how to present this properly in
an UI.  The Kconfig files are the wrong place to attack this problem.
PPS:
Really, it's *not* hard *at all* to configure a 2.6.24-rc6 kernel with
USB storage support.  I don't read linux-usb --- has there been repeated
questions how to enable usb-storage in the kernel configuration?  I can
tell you that there has been no such question about sbp2 (FireWire
storage support) in years.  Don't fix what ain't broken.  In fact, don't
/break/ what ain't broken by adding more of the (as yet) broken 'select'
everywhere.
