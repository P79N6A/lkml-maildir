I'm sorry.
Oops did dump on my home pc. But it didn't on my office pc.
I'll take back the patch, and check what I've done wrong at office.

I was interested in "Bad swap file entry" problem.
I expereiced this myself. After (quite a lot of ) "Bad swap file
entry" error log from kernel, it Oopsed three times, then kernel was
dead ( It's almost three years from now, so this was without kdump ).
I did find that three Oops happened inside page_referenced() function,
and that it was due to NULL pointer. In 2.6.24, it was only this "mm"
and one more in page_referenced_file() that did not have NULL pointer
check.
So I was really thinking about two more patches. One for "mappers"
NULL pointer check, and other one is to add msr printout when Oops or
Pank happens , to make sure that when Oops or Paniced, still my PC is
not broken.
I needed the evidence so that I don't have to worry about
broken Memory, nor broken Cache.
and I think we still do not have MSRs dumped out as
part of kdump..
# Am I wrong again??
