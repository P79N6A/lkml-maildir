If I understood your two-column diagram correctly, scenario below can't
happen because of PDE's own refcount (->count) and existence of
->deleted (0/1)
remove_proc_entry() sees positive ->count and doesn't immediately free
PDE. remove_proc_entry() will at most a) lock b) access to check
->proc_fops which is NULL now, and c) unlock which is fine because
memory is in place.
->count is bumped in proc_get_inode after checking PDEs lists, but our
PDE was already removed from it.
