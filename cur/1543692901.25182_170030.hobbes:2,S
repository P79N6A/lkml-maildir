Hi everyone,
My network card (nvidia) is capable of Wake on Lan.
When I issue the following commands from the command line, the system shuts
down immediately and powers up on Wake on Lan:
pci-config -#12 -S
/sbin/halt -hdf
(pci-config from scyld.com)
However, when I put those commands in the /etc/init.d/halt.sh script, the
system won't wake up. ( I put a 'sleep 3' command in between the two others
to give pci-config the time to work) 
I have APM in my kernel as follows: (ACPI disabled)

  &#9474; &#9474;                        [*]     Use real mode APM BIOS call

I use gentoo with the gentoo-kernel-2.4.20-r7.
Has anyone a clue why the wake on lan doesn't work from the shutdown scripts,
and does work from the commandline?
Thanks,
Elton Algera
