Linux always does a single copy for TCP, and the checksum is folded into
that. Doing just the checksum alone wouldn't be much less costly.
[Note this is only true for 2.4 in the fast path, 2.2 RX usually does 
checksum and copy-to-user separated, unless you have hardware RX checksumming
For TX we always do a single copy checksum out of user space or out of the
page cache when you use sendfile or mmap]
