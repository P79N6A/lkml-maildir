Neil's patch is to make the annoying regression test failure go away. To 
be honest I have had *one* user email me that this is a problem and once I 
gave them the "don't remove the cable on token ring, its not ethernet" 
talk, they were fine.

It works, its used by an ever decreasing number of users - let it have a 
peaceful and graceful old age.
