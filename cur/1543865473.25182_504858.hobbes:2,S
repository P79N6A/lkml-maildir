Generally, a function which only returns a boolean is fine in a condition,
because that's exactly how the result will be used. The problem with
functions in if() is that many ifs are used to check for errors, and
during debugging phases, it's quite common to comment out an if block.
So the functions with side effects, including those who modify the
arguments, should never be used in a if() or while() which might be
commented out.
So the following block should be OK :
	if (!netif_running(dev)) {
		reset_driver(dev);
		retry--;
	}
While the following one is dangerous :
	if (!read_next_word(hw, &word))
		return -EINVAL;
During debugging, a block like above might end up like this :
	if (!read_next_word(hw, &word));
	//	return -EINVAL;
You can imagine what will result from this code later : the
return will be uncommented and the semi-colon forgotten :
	if (!read_next_word(hw, &word));
		return -EINVAL;
We have already found many bugs following this exact construction.
With the obvious solution, there would be no problem :
	ret = read_next_word(hw, &word);
	if (!ret)
		return -EINVAL;

Willy
