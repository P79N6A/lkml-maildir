A filesystem is not the place for that - it could either be done at a
lower level, like I suggested in a separate post, or at a much higher
level - E.G. a database which encounters a write error could dump it's
entire contents to a tape drive, shuts down, and page an
administrator, on the basis that the write error indicated impending
drive failiure.

Are you using the disks within their operational limits?  Are you sure
they are not overheating and/or being run 24/7 when they are not
intended to be?
