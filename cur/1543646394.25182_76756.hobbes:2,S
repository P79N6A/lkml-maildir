I think that is the real issue. We're mapping something - probably a host
bridge - at address 0, and then accessing RAM (which is also is mapped at 
PCI address 0) and the host bridge is unhappy.
So excluding the change is probably the right thing to do - it's just 
fundamentally buggy to blindly put a base register at zero.
