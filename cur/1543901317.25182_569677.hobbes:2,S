then we need a third mode of operation.
mode 1: Suspend-to-ram
   the system is paused and put into a low-power mode but data remains in 
memory and the system stays awake enough to keep the memory refreshed.
mode 2: new
   the system is paused, data is stored to permanent media, and the system 
is put into a ultra-low power mode.
mode 3: hibernate
   the system is paused, data is stored to permanent media, and the system 
is powered off
with mode 3 there are no requirements or limitations about what can be 
done with the hardware before a resume (the resume could even take place 
on a different piece of identical hardware)
mode 2 could be what you are talking about doing, although I don't see any 
advantage of creating it in additon to mode 3, it doesn't use any less 
power and it locks the system so that it can't be used for anything else 
in the meantime. I guess if it was significantly faster to do then mode 3 
there may be _some_ reason to consider it, but I don't see the speed 
difference.
