If you want to go in full sync with the other vm fixes and improvements
in my tree I can send you the other remaining patches to apply (not
before the end of next week though), they works so well that I don't get
a single vm report for several months and I would like if they could
reach mainline too infact since they are over-time-refinement only,
nothing I would call major or very significant. Maybe if you merge them,
then Marcelo will merge them too?  most of them are easily mergeable by
just checking my ftp area, most start with 05_vm_ and they shouldn't be
very controversial. Andrew blessed them too, when he splitted them (he
only giveup on the "-rest" patch so that one is still very monolithic
sorry ;).
