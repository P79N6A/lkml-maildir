"small banana"? Freud would go wild.
But no. I don't want it under the Documentation directory: I'd much rather
have them _together_ with the config file.
So the config file format could be something that includes the docs, and
you could do something like
	find . -name '*.cf' -exec grep '^+' {} \; > Configure.help
for old tools, and nw tools would just automatically get the docs from the
same place they get the config info.
And there would _never_ be more than a few entries per config file: you
can imagine having a separate config file for PCI 100Mbps ethernet drivers
and one for ISA drivers.
The current Configure.help is 25k _lines_, and over a megabyte in size. I
would never consider that good taste in programming, why should I consider
it good in documentation?
