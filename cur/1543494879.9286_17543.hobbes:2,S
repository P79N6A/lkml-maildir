In cases like this, I recommend adding a comment to that place. Linus
should get into the habbit of accepting patches that add comments.
"the source" should be acommunication channel. 
Like today, Linus explained some stuff about some flag, and I think
that should get to go in the code.
People like James, should be "allowed" to dive in and do some stupid
footwork to get to know the kernel a bit better....
