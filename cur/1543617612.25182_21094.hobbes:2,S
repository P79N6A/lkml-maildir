This email is just to let you all know that the original interview was the
english one. I published it as it was in my IRC log, without correcting
any grammatical/syntactical error, removing emoticons, changing any word.

Rik, I asked you to choose between an email or IRC interview, you chose
IRC, so from that moment if you used an informal language, it was out
of my job. If you aren't able to take your responsabilities for your
actions or words, this probably means you're not enough mature to be a
maintainer. If you are sure to be a victim, publish your logs, i'll be
happy to publish mine.

The interview was translated to italian by a highly qualified person.
Anyway, both italian and english interviews are on the web, i'm sure
Andrea, or whoever, will be happy to tell you if anything was changed.
