Hi Tim,
[please CC this sort of question to xfs@oss.sgi.com]
Can you send xfs_info output for the filesystem and the output
from xfs_bmap -vvp on this file?
The file size has zero effect on performance, but the number and
layout of the files extents is very relevent.  How was this file
created?
cheers.
