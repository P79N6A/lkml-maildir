Example:  Say the proposed utsname virtualization gets a new clone  
flag (CLONE_NEWUTSNAME).  Old headers would obviously not include the  
CLONE_NEWUTSNAME define.  If you want to compile a glibc that uses  
CLONE_NEWUTSNAME, you need to build it against a set of the "kabi  
headers" from a version of the kernel that includes the feature.  The  
resulting glibc will _run_ on any kernel; if you call clone 
(CLONE_NEWUTSNAME) on an older kernel it would return EINVAL but work  
otherwise.  A glibc that does *not* use CLONE_NEWUTSNAME would build  
an identical binary with older versions and newer versions.  This is  
_exactly_ the way things work now, except there is no outside llh  
project, it's all stored in the kernel tree.
