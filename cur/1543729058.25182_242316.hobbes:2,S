As I said above, I cannot prevent accidentals (VID/PIDs aren't
printed on the disk, yo know...) And usb-storage must not deal
with disks that it cannot deal with:
1. This particular disk can lead to panics as I said.
2. If someone ever writes a driver specific to this device (I
    know it's less than highly unlikely), than it would be also
    useful in that case if the disk isn't tried to be owned by
    usb-storage. That, I think applies as a general case, too.
