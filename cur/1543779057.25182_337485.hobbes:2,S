There's no clear policy, but that is my general recommendation:  Just 
add IDs to pci.ids at sourceforge.net as soon as their public, and then, 
add constants to include/linux/pci_ids.h as they are required in the code.
I would -prefer- that this be kernel policy, but I can only speak for 
IDs used [or not] in my drivers.  It just seems silly to add constants 
that are never used, though.
[speaking to the audience]  I wouldn't mind if someone did a pass 
through pci_ids.h and removed all the constants that are not being used. 
  If constants are not being used, it's IMHO more appropriate to store 
that info in pci.ids.
