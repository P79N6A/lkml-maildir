I'm pretty certain the range OLD_DT_LOOS ... DT_LOOS must be excluded
here (the document version I'm looking at is inconsistent in itself here, saying
in one place to stop at DT_LOOS, in a second to stop at DT_HIOS, and in a
third to include DT_LOOS ... ST_HIOS - the inconsistency goes away if
assuming that the stop at DT_LOOS really means stop at OLD_DT_LOOS,
and the stop at DT_HIOS misses to special-case the OLD_DT_LOOS ...
DT_LOOS range.
Additionally I'm a little worried about excluding DT_ADDRRNGLO ...
DT_ADDRRNGHI in case future binutils ever start defaulting to generate
any of these (namely DT_GNU_HASH).

Hmm, I was about to say this ought to be 31 when I realized the discrepancy
between document and binutils. I'll have to ask about this...
