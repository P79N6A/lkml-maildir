It's actually a relatively annoying limit, as various boxen's MP tables
ACPI tables etc. etc. are well above 8MB. At some point one of us should
quash that issue permanently and dynamically map the things. IIRC Linux
needs NUMA-Q boxen to get lynxers reflashed to move MP tables below 8MB
to boot atm. mbligh can more accurate describe the pain involved there.
As for the bzImage, don't bother supporting excess bloat.
All I can say is, "bring me the head of the first moron who shoves some
table needed at boot-time above 4GB".
