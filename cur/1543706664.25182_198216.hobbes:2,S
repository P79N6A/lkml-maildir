Hello.
I have stumbled upon a grave bug, I think. I can reproduce a hard lock-up using
xmms and a buggy plugin - only SysRq-B helps. I managed to narrow it down to
"0.5/NAN"-like operation. It only causes a complete hang when xmms is run with
SCHED_RR priority. Otherwise, only xmms hangs. Unfortunately, I was not able to
create a working proof-of-concept program.
The question is - is this a kernel bug, OR something that cannot be prevented
from happening when using SCHED_RR policy?
Tried with 2.6.3-rc[12] and glibc-2.3.2 (-r9 gentoo) with nptl support (if that
matters).
Have a nice day.
Rudo.
