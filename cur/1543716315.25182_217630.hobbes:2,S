This is not needed.  I've just checked all drivers:
- no IORDY fix is not necessary for alim15x3.c
- hwif->ultra_mask fix is only needed for OSB4
[ I discovered another bug in the process - some drivers are using
  hwif->ultra_mask == 0x80 to indicate that UDMA is unsupported
  but bit 0x80 means UDMA7 (UDMA150) now, oh well. ]
Therefore I will send Marcelo backport of 2.6 patch for no IORDY support
+ your OSB4 fix and Linus will get only your OSB4 fix.  Thanks!
Cheers,
Bartlomiej
