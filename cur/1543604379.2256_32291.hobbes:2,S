Short version: Kicks ass!
Long version: the sluggishness that 2.4.9, 2.4.10 and the previous -ac
versions suffered from (not sure if 2.4.7 was also sluggish) seems to be
gone, the machine is much quieter now and does not look like paralysed
for seconds every now and then. Stress tests need to be done, but a make
-j on various DJB tools which would start up only slowly now quickly
zoom through.
However, one thing strikes me on boot: ext3fs claims it's 0.9.6, while
the ext3 web site tells us about 0.9.10. What's going on with 2.4.x-ac
ext3fs? Should I be concerned?
