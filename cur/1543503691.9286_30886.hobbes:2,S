We have discussed this yesterday, see mails with the Subject
	"Out of memory -- System halted".
Problem is that the heap buffer, which is used for internal data
structures while uncompressing the kernel image, is too small for certain
byte patterns in a compressed image.
This seems to happen very seldom (or maybe the failure is not reported
because the problems disappears magically with the next kernel version).
You could try the following patch which defines the same heap buffer size
as it is used in zlib, if you have a kernel again which reports out of
memory at decompressing stage.
