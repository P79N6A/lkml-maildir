Kernels that previously worked fine all now experience the same symptom. Even RH's own kernels exhibit this. The kernel built Nov 24th works, Nov 26th doesn't. gcc was updated 26th, 14 hours earlier.

Digging a bit further, it is indeed the high-res stuff (the first missing message) that hangs. If I hard code the kernel to just be non-high-res capable, it boots, but time keeping is horribly broken.
Anyway, hopefully this means I'll soon have the object file that gets miscompiled. Jakub also pointed me to an older gcc RPM so that I can produce an object file with that as well and see what differs.
