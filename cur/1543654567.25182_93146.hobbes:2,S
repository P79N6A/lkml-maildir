Thanks Alan, now dma works perfect!
How come this code isn't in the official 2.4.20 kernel?
The only strange thing now is that uname doesn't know my cpu:
starbase:/# uname -a
Linux starbase 2.4.20-ac1 #1 Sam Nov 30 18:43:15 CET 2002 i686 unknown 
unknown GNU/Linux
starbase:/#
But it gets recognized during boot:
starbase:/# dmesg | grep -i AMD
CPU: AMD Athlon(tm) XP 2200+ stepping 00
starbase:/#
starbase:/# cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -i AMD
vendor_id       : AuthenticAMD
model name      : AMD Athlon(tm) XP 2200+
starbase:/#
But hey, I can live with that - I have dma now :-)
Just curious, what's causing this.
Thanks so much...
Patrick
