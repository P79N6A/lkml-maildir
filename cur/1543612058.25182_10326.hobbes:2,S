Why do I have the feeling that you're just changing those values
so you get less chance of having the problem?  Are there any
other reason why you change this?  It might even be a good idea
to test it with lower values.

You can also argue that you're trying to fix the problem by
hiding it.  It would be useful that it still reported the same
error message, so you can see that if it happens again with the
patch that it no longer locks up.
