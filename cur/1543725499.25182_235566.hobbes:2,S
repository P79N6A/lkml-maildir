Personaly as many of my friends (those who use and care about kernel) we 
think that devfs is (was) the only resonable solution for /dev tree, and 
should be only one maintained. Requirement of userspace software for 
/dev is just a one big mistake. IMO in year time someone will have 
another brilliant idea, and will rip udev off. I don't think that's a 
good solution. IMO (and that was my humble opinion) devfs should be 
maintained instead of rewriting thing again, and creating problems (udev 
is not present unless userspace is up, etc).
so for me, and many others devfs should stay as only solution :-)
I am pretty shocked that there is no expierenced developer to maintain 
devfs. I would be delighted to do it, but I guess it's over my schledue. 
I don't have time enough to maintain my KDE stuff atm, not to mention 
kernel bits...
(no flames please, just giving my opinion).
