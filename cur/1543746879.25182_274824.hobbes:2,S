I suspect PPC resume issues myself.

That does seem to be the first problem; fixing
it (that is, making sure IRQs arrive again!)
should make the rest go away.

Those look like plausible ways for that driver to
behave.  "-19" == "-ENODEV" for device-gone (you
unplugged it!), though the rest (timeout, EIO)
suggest that WLAN code fault recovery is wierd.

As expected, if IRQs aren't arriving.  Though you
may not be using the latest kernel; it's supposed
to give warnings about IRQ delivery problems after
resume too, not just on initial startup.

The only obvious "looks wrong" thing from that WLAN
code is discarding the non-recoverable ENODEV status
in favor of reporting a usually-recoverable (timeout)
then maybe-recoverable (EIO) error.  But that's not
necessarily troublesome here.

Most people aren't... :)
I'm not expert in PPC IRQ delivery, which is where the
root cause of this problem seems to live.  We all have
places where we need help!
