Gack! I just thought of something else:
According to the 82371AB datasheet the controller
itself sets the USBCMD_FGR bit when a global RD is
detected. So qualifying the wakeup in software won't
prevent the controller itself from starting the
wakeup process on a false RD from an OC port. :-(
Hmmmm.... crap
Is there a way around this or are we back to
preventing the suspend?
