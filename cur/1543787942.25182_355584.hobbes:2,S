Paul,
	pnotify is extreme overkill for the process events connector. The
per-task subscriber lists, data, inheritance of those lists, tasklist
locking, and iteration over the lists are all overhead compared to the
process events connector patch.
	For the process events connector it makes more sense to have a global
list of subscribers interested all tasks. If there are M kernel modules
interested in getting events for all N tasks this would save space
proportional to M*N compared to pnotify. Of course this means the
elements of this list could not have per-task data.
	I think per-task data should be split out from pnotify and submitted as
a separate system used by pnotify. Maybe with a *_PER_TASK API similar
to *_PER_CPU.
Cheers,
	-Matt Helsley
