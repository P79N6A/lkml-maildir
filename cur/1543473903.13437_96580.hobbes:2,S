Are there alternatives to the current proc approach? For instance, it
might be feasable to replace procfs with a usermode filesystem driver that
talks to the kernel via a single binary interface of some sort. 
I think this would have several advantages:
- a large amount of complexity removed from the kernel
- removes formatting policy to user space (this is the big win)
- fewer kernel races if the binary interface is a single syscall
- applications that wanted high-speed access would have binary access
  available
- if you make this a priviledged call, you force the permission policy
  into the userspace tool as well
- the user app could be runtime configurable
Disadvantages:
- current userfs systems may be a little ungainly (but I wouldn't know)
- requires a consistent interface (perhaps like sysctl?)
- version skew issues between user tool and kernel
- some fatal flaw I haven't thought of yet
