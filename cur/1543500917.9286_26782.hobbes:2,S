: Yeah, sure. I realise that. But if resources are going to be put into
: setting up a test bench, I'd hope that it's not too narrowly focussed.

: The FreeBSD ftp results prompted Larry to promote the idea of a

: idea?
Nobody is suggesting that.  What they are saying is this:
a) the Gbit setup is more realistic in real life.  If you needed more
   bandwidth, you get a bigger pipe.   We could optimize for 10 100Mbit
   cards, but that would be pretty silly, right?  99.9% of the machines
   in the world can't support that many cards.
b) the point of performance work is **NOT** benchmarks.  The point of
   performance work is to get better performance.  I could care less if
   we do well or poorly in benchmarks against anyone.  What I do care
   about (and you should as well) is that we do well under real workloads.
c) if you ask for too much, you get nothing.  Let's stay focussed on the
   original setup.  If that actually happens, yields results, the kernel
   improves, asking for more hardware is easy.
Thanks,
