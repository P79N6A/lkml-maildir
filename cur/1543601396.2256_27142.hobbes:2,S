Andrea,
Personally I think it is too late in the 2.4.x series to integrate your
code.
I have nothing against the code itself (the "old" code also had bugs), but
a major VM rewrite at this point seems to be dangerous if we want a stable
VM.
Don't you agree that your code can introduce new stability bugs ?
Linus, please, if you want to integrate Andrea's code do it in 2.5.x, but
not 2.4.x. (yes, I'm expecting you to scream at me now :))
