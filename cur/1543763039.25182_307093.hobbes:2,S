This driver was first sent out for review a month ago, was upissued twice
and generated over seventy linux-kernel emails including some from Russell
and some from Greg.  It was by no means a "premature" addition.
One could say that it was inadequately reviewed, but how is one to
determine that?  If the thing has been under discussion for a month and the
submitter says "I've addressed all comments" then it's going to get merged.
