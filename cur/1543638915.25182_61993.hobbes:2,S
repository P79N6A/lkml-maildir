Yes. But, I'm not sure how I want to do it. A while back, I converted it 
to use the seq_file interface, with a (probably broken) implementation of 
seq_write(). I'm not sure how well it would fit into what we have now, but 
I definitely agree that it should be simpler.

The seq_file interface would allow for that.
One purely evil solution might be to just pass a zero'd page-sized buffer 
to be filled one time. We then do strlen() on it for the size, and copy 
what the user wants. It would still require some extra state, but it would 
force people to stick to ASCII, instead of trying to sneak in some binary 
data ;)

Yeah, that's definitely broken.
