Subject: [RFC][PATCH 1/2] Twofish cipher i586-asm optimized
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Implementation:
-----------------------
This code is based on the current linux twofish cipher c implementation. Only 
the decrypt/encrypt routines were replaced by optimized assembler code. The 
in-kernel code by Matthew Skala takes care of the keysetup and precomputation 
of the sbox lookup tables.
I have tried to cut down stack use to a minimum (1 push/pop per round) and 
optimize the code as much as possible. The patch is similar to the existing 
aes assembler implementation.
Testing:
-----------
The code passed the kernel test module and passed automated tests on a 
dm-crypt volume reading/writing large files with alternating modules ( c / 
assembler ) and comparing results.
Benchmarks:
-------------------
Performance on a dm-crypt volume increased about 30% while reading. With 
256bit keylength it even outperformed the 128bit aes assembler code.

The write performance in this benchmark was limited by the harddrive and not 
the algorithm / system speed. Any suggestions how to benchmark the overall 
speed accurately are welcome.

Please have a look, try, improve and criticise.
