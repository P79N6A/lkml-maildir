More drivers should do this, even though not many do so right now.  In the
ideal case, the PHY can be active for link detection without the rest of
the adapter being powered up...

Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt has warned about this since
August, and the PM list has discussed how broken that model is numerous
times over the past several years.  (I'm pretty sure that discussion has
leaked out to LKML on occasion.)  It shouldn't be news today.

More than one driver stack probably needs to start paying attention to
its power management models.  I think Arjan is right about the basic
mindset of "down == off" for network drivers.  If there are cases where
that doesn't work, those can start driving improvements.
