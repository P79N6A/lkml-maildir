Linus,
With all due respect, Larry could have dealt with this years ago and
removed the motivation for Tridge and others to pursue reverse
engineering.   Instead he chose to insult and question the motives of
everyone that wanted open-source access to the Linux history data.  The
blame for the current situation falls firmly on the choice to use a
closed-source SCM for Linux and the actions of the company that owned it.
