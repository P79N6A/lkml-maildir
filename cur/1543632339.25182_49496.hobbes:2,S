can you try to reproduce with 2.4.19pre9aa2 just in case it's an oom
deadlock, and if it deadlocks again can you press SYSRQ+T, and many
times SYSQR+P, and send this info along the system.map (you may need the
serial console to easily gather the data if not even a SYSRQ+I is able
to let the box resurrect from the livelock). (the system.map possibly
not on l-k because it's quite big)
thanks!
