You may be right... I suppose everything will bite someone somewhere with a 
sufficiently large user base.
As for whether Committed_AS is more appropriate, I'll have to defer to Herbert 
on this one.  He stated that RLIMIT_DATA no longer does what it was intended 
to do, and offered a fix for it, and I agreed with him.  I do believe his 
patch does a reasonable approximation of the original intent of RLIMIT_DATA, 
but I didn't delve into the actual intended use of it once it's fixed.

In that code shared_vm includes everything that's mmap()ed, including private 
mappings.  But if you look at Herbert's patch he has the following change:
        if (file) {
-               mm->shared_vm += pages;
+               if (flags & VM_SHARED)
+                       mm->shared_vm += pages;
                if ((flags & (VM_EXEC|VM_WRITE)) == VM_EXEC)
                        mm->exec_vm += pages;
This means that shared_vm now is truly only memory that's mapped VM_SHARED and 
does not include VM_EXEC memory.  That necessitates the separate subtraction 
of exec_vm in the data calculations.
