Subject: [PATCH 0/9] RT: balance rt tasks v6
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/24/251

Applies to 23-rt1
Changes since v5:
*) Folded some of the smaller patches together to address feedback
*) Fixed several minor bugs related to PI re-factoring and wakeup paths
I still have yet to make Ingo Oeser's suggestion to the last patch.
At this point, things are looking really really good.  So this is a request to
provide a formal review (if one has not yet been done) and to consider for
inclusion in -rt.
In my testing, cyclictest look great (ran overnight on a 4-way with the max
outlier at 32us), the preempt-test passes with flying colors, and we see a
300% improvement in latency spikes on large SMP systems (16-way is the largest
we have in our small lab).
I will rebase to -rt2 when its available.
You can find the preempt-test here:
