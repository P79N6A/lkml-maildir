The latest changes in 2.3.99-pre1 broke apm=power-off.
What happens is that the apm starts kapmd, which is set to immediately exit for SMP.  It then unregisters the poweroff handler
making it nonfunctional.
I made a temporary fix by making kapmd sit in an idle loop in SMP mode.  It's a bit messy as it's soaking up idle time
when it doesn't need to.  Hopefully someone will come up with a better one... :-)
