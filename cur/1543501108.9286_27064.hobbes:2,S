First clarification: increasing HZ has big payoffs for a program like
your benchmark, which *isn't* burning CPU cycles generating audio in
real time. But it can be problematic for an application that can use
every available cycle for its own work, because the ten-fold increase
in timer interrupt frequency is going to steal cycles. Does anyone
have any idea how many (x86) cycles it takes to process a timer
interrupt that doesn't result in any change to the tasks running on
each CPU ?
>But I want audio latency to exceed the basic MIDI latency.
Second clarification: by "exceed" I meant "be better than" i.e. lower.
