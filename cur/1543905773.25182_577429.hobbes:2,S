It's good to see that people finally try this.
I used crashkernel=16M@16M, which is the absolute minimum I managed to have 
the crashkernel boot successfully.

That's not enough.  You have to set the CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START to 1,000,000 
for a 16M start.  That's because the crashkernel only supports vmlinux, 
which cannot be relocatable.

Nothing, but the doc isn't really clear on this, and an update is probably in 
order.
Thanks!
