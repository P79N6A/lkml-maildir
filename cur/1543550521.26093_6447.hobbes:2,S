Well, I did my best, and without too much trouble I managed to sink the
kernel into a grinding halt. No oops, and it still responded to SysRQ,
but nothing else.
This was with v2.4.0-test9-pre8+your patches.
Oh, and I guess this is for you to fix:
page_alloc.c: In function `__alloc_pages':
page_alloc.c:473: warning: suggest parentheses around comparison in operand of &
page_alloc.c:536: warning: int format, long int arg (arg 2)
(I HATE buildtime warnings.)
