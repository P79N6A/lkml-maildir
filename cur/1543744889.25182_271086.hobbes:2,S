Ah OK. Interesting reading.

Hmm OK. I won't quiz you on the impelementation as I'm sure you've
thought it through, and I haven't :)
... but humor me, you _are_ ensuring the following doesn't get
reordered, say:
(write, sect 100), (barrier), (write, sect 200)
Right? It isn't clear from your description what you are intending
(and I'm too lazy to read the code at the moment!).

Well it goes FIFO to the extent that the barrier definition requires:
all requests before the barrier are issued before any requests
after the barrier.

Well it sounds interesting. Good luck with it...
No comment on your prio tree generalization, sorry. Other than: it
seems to be unfortunately quite ugly. Obviously better than duplicating
the code, but... it may just be worth holding onto it until it has
another user about to be merged as well (eg. add the patch to the front
of your ABISS elevator if you submit it to 2.6 or -mm).
But I don't have strong feelings on the matter. If Rajesh says its OK
to go ahead as is, that would be fine by me :)
Good luck!
