thanks for your suggestion, i'll take it into account for future patches

initially i added the include line (i think at least one patch still
contains it), but then i realized that in most cases the original code
doesn't include semaphore.h and i (mis-)interpreted that it should be
handled the same way (relying upon nested includes) for mutexes. 
do you want me to send you a version of the patches containing the
include?
