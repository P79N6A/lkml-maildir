Hi Linus,

For s390/s390x this is actually quite tricky. The system call number is
coded in the instruction, e.g. 0x0aa2 is svc 162 or sys_nanosleep. There
is no register involved that contains the system call number I could
simply change. I either have to change the instruction (no way) or I
have to avoid going back to userspace in this case. This would require
assembler magic in entry.S. Not nice.
