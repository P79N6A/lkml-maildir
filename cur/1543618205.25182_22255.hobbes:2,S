In order to do this you can not issue a sector request larger than an
addressable buffer, since the request walking of the rq->buffer is not
allowed.

We agreed upon error is the "memcpy_to_local" and "free local buffer".
If a low-memory contigious physical buffers was allocated and all the
bounce_memory locations were copied there before submition to the lower
levels, the drives could run down the buffer and be done, preserve the
entire request for error handling when a write to media fails.

The second buffer has been taken away, so this is not possible.

Explain where buffer B come from, because I am totally lost on the above.
I am totally worn out and do not care about the issue anymore for now.
