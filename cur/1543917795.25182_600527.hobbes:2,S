#if CONFIG_PRINTK_DOICARE >= 3
#define PRINTK_DEBUG_CONTINUED "",
#else
#define PRINTK_DEBUG_CONTINUED PRINTK_DEBUG
#endif
...
#define printk(level, str, ...) \
   do { \
     if (sizeof(level) == 1) /* continued printk */\
        actual_printk(str, __VA_ARGS__); \
     else if ((level[1] - '0') < CONFIG_PRINTK_DOICARE) \
       actual_printk(level str, __VA_ARGS__); \
   } while(0);
Now you can mark a continued KERN_ERR call as such.  And depending on
CONFIG_PRINTK_DOICARE it will either be printed as always or turned into
a stand-alone printk() that gets optimized away.  Do the same for all
the other levels.
Open question remains: do we want to go down that road?  I have no idea.
