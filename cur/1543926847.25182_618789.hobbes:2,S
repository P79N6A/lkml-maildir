I don't know if this is at all feasible, but is it possible to have a
mechanism that would detect a fork bomb in progress and either stop the
fork, or allow the user to cancel the operation?  For example, are there
any legitimate processes (i.e. ones that really need to fork like crazy)
that would need to generate 200+ processes in less than 1 second?
(Note: I'm not a programmer; I'm just throwing out the idea.)
