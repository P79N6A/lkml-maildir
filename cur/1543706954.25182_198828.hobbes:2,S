Is there a patch to the stable/vanilla 2.4 kernel tree which provides
the O(1) scheduler code from 2.6? The closest thing I can find is:
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/O
(1)-scheduler/sched-HT-2.4.22-ac1-A0
which is for AC (and is also A0), is there a newer 2.4.23/24 patch
that works against stock? The above patch fails miserably against a
stock 2.4.22 kernel.
There is 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/sched/ingo-O1/
 
the latest which is sched-O1-rml-2.4.20-rc3-1.patch, but that too
fails horribly on a stock 2.4.22.
I've been crawling through list archives, but have yet to find
anything, so I am reduced to asking. :)
