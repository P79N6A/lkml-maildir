Hi !
When I try to compile the latest kernel with 3.0.4, I get a parse error:
In file included from include/asm/suspend.h:7,
                  from include/linux/suspend.h:5,
                  from arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.c:11:
include/asm/i387.h:55: warning: `always_inline' attribute directive ignored
include/asm/i387.h: In function `__save_init_fpu':
include/asm/i387.h:58: parse error before '[' token
include/asm/i387.h:68: parse error before '[' token
include/asm/i387.h: At top level:
include/asm/i387.h:96: warning: `always_inline' attribute directive ignored
With gcc 2.95.4, I get a "compiler too old" errors, and the same parsing 
error... so, gcc 3.0.4 (Debian Woody) will be also in the compiler blacklist, 
or can it be fixed ?
Cheers,
