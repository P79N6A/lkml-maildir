Implementing signals with good worst case 
timing seems very implausible to me. We don't even
have timing guarantees for signals in RTLinux where the kernel is simple.
The main reason is SMP -- if the target thread/process is running on a
second CPU, you need to send a IPI and then have the remote processor
run signal code. But ipis are relatively slow and the remote processor
may have interrupts disabled and ...

On processor A a SIG_STOP is issued to a thread-group  while on processor
B a thread element has just entered write. How many bytes written is
"good enough".
I've really exceeded my quota for this news group and will respond
privately if you want to continue.
