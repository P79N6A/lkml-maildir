I think you should be able to do this if you make a suid binary that
calls mlockall(MCL_CURRENT|MCL_FUTURE)
drops capabilities
exec()s the desired app
Note that fork()'d children are not locked, and that the apps may segfault if 
they try to write to newly allocated memory and there is no more left.  It will 
still be possible to segfault on newly allocated stack as well.  However, once 
the app aquires memory, it will not be paged out.
