Could someone speak a few words on why a patch such as this is
desirable?
Apparently, there is more value to avoiding non-essential include's than
I realize.  I'd have preferred doing a memcpy of "sizeof(some_struct)"
over doing it for SOME_STRUCT_SIZE constant, and I'd have thought it
appropriate to include whatever header files were needed to do that.
The simple "wc -l" size of the kernel source goes up a couple of lines,
the code complexity is unchanged, and the generated code is unchanged. 
So obviously none of those factors motivate this change.
