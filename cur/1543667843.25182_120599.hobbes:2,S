Ok, bringing this here because it's bugging a few of us.
Scenario:
  Linux 2.4.X kernel with scsi-generic, usb-storage, fat and vfat compiled 
as modules.  I plug in my usb drive (archos jukebox or sandisk
thumbdrive) and it won't autoload the sg and usb-storage drivers.  If I
modprobe sg, modprobe usb-drive it will autoload fat and vfat.
  What the heck do I need to change on my Debian system (I can try and
convert redhat directions) to get this chain working properly?
Thanks,
  Robert
(I'll forward out to the other list in question)
