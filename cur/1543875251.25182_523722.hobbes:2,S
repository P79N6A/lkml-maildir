You know, it would be one thing if they were consistent. A policy that, by
default, you get all the optimizations the relevant standards allow wouldn't
be a problem. But they do this when they feel like it, and they disable
significant optimizations even where the standards allow them when they feel
like that.
See, for example:
http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=20099
"You cannot create code that works with this option and doesn't work without
it except by violating the POSIX standard. So POSIX code should not have
this option enabled by default -- it's a pure pessimization." Yet the option
is on by default when -pthreads is specified.
