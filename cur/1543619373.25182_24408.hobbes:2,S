Once more beating a dead horse, you don't improve scalability by finding a
better way to push everything through one person. "Random documentation
updates" and "corrections to MAINTAINERS mailing addresses" could and
should be approved by someone else.
So should the 1-2-3 liners which are clearly and obviously tiny bug fixes
for obvious problems, off by one, mistyped lock names, adding casts to
make the kernel compile w/o hundreds of "you don't understand C type
rules" warnings.
The way to get crap out of your life is to trust some people to identify
changes of this type and leave you to code review significant changes. The
most efficient way to do something is to avoid having to do it all all,
not by doing the wrong thing better. Pushing hard to you is like hand
coding a bubble sort in assembler, the problem is not in the
implementation but the algorithm.
