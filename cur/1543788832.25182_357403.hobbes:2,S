Oh, don't be stupid.  You would just redirty the page and return.  See
for example the writepage implementation in fs/ntfs/aops.c...

That would never really happen.  The probability of every single dirty
page on the system being tied into needing a memory allocation is very
close to zero...  It is just a theoretical deadlock.

That is impossible to do for complex filesystems.  Every filesystem
would have to pre-allocate masses of memory from all sorts of places
(you would need pages that can be plugged into the page cache and/or you
would need buffers and/or you would need bios which you are not allowed
to hold onto so you would already have a problem here, etc...) to be
able to do that and that would impact system performance greatly unless
you had ridiculous amount of ram to start with in which case you would
not need to bother with this complexity as you would never oom anyway.
Best regards,
