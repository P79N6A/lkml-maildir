It has no SMP scalability cost, and not really much CPU cost (it's less
costly than HZ=1000, for example).  Its main problem is space consumption.

Spose so.  Do we care though?  Unix standards do not specify truncate
behaviour with nonlinear mappings anyway.
Our behaviour right now is "random crap".  If there's a reason why we want
consistent semantics then yes, we'll need to do an rmap walk or something
in there.  But is there a requirement?  What is it?
One thing which clearly _should_ have sane semantics with nonlinear
mappings is mincore().  MAP_NONLINEAR broke that too.

NOFAIL is what 2.4 has always done, and has the deadlock opportunities
which you mention.  The other modes allow the caller to say "don't try
forever".
It's mainly a cleanup - it allowed the removal of lots of "try forever"
loops by consolidating that behaviour in the page allocator.  If all
callers are fixed up to not require NOFAIL then we don't need it any more.

Actually it improves aging information.  Think of a GFP_KERNEL allocation
on an 8G 2.4.x box: an average of 10 or more highmem pages get bogusly
rotated to the wrong end of the LRU for each scanned lowmem page.
That's speculation btw.  I don't have any numbers or tests which indicate
that it was a net win in this regard.
