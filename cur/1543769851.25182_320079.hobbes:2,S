If its for documentation, then its ok, the reason i thought it will
be dead code/documentation soon is since 90% of the hotplug code is
generic kernel code, which is not under __cpuinit, just some pieces of 
x86_64 would alone exist this way, and will not serve real purpose very soon.
If you still prefer to exist as __cpuinit, i dont have a problem leaving them
around for the time being.
