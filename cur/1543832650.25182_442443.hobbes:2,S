NAK to just about all of this. Its gratuitous breaking of existing apps,
it achieves nothing and some of it like the pty stuff is just plain
incorrect anyway.
If you want to add sysfs interfaces to the tty code great, but please
leave the existing, relied up, functional and effectively user space ABI
tty files alone.
