IMO, I think SystemTap is to generic of a tool to be considered a 
tracing tool.  LKET and LKST are more comparable with the functionality 
that LTT provides.  LKET is implemented using SystemTap while LKST has 
both a SystemTap and static kernel patch implementation.

Agree.  What would be the criteria that justifies having static probe vs 
a dynamic one?
