Hi,
We observe a problem with MSI since kernel 2.6.21 where interrupts would
randomly stop working. We have tracked it down to the new
msi_set_mask_bit definition in 2.6.21. In the MSI case with a device not
providing a "native" MSI mask, it was a no-op before, and now it
disables MSI in the MSI-ctl register which according to the PCI spec is
interpreted as reverting the device to legacy interrupts. If such a
device try to generate a new interrupt during the "masked" window, the
device will try a legacy interrupt which is generally
ignored/never-acked and cause interrupts to no longer work for the
device/driver combination (even after the enable bit is restored).
Is there anything apart from irq migration that strongly requires
masking? Is is possible to do the irq migration without masking?
