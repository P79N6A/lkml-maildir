process_load is a CPU scheduler thing, not a disk scheduler thing.  Something
must have changed in kernel/sched.c.
It's debatable whether 210 seconds is worse than 110 seconds in
this test, really.  You have four processes madly piping stuff around and
four to eight processes compiling stuff.  I don't see why it's "worse"
that the compile happens to get 31% of the CPU time in this kernel.  One
would need to decide how much CPU it _should_ get before making that decision.

Try sysrq-p.
