Subject: softlockup: fix Xen bogosity

       Ignore stolen time in the softlockup watchdog
broke the softlockup watchdog to never report any lockups. (!)
print_timestamp defaults to 0, this makes the following condition
always true:
	if (print_timestamp < (touch_timestamp + 1) ||
and we'll never report soft lockups.
apparently the functionality of the soft lockup watchdog was never 
actually tested with that patch applied ...
[ this is -stable material too. ]
