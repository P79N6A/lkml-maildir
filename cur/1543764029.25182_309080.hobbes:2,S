the existing request_firmware() has nothing in common with IHEX parser
and such a parser should not belong there. So either make it a separate
module or add it to the module that is using it. In this case this is
the keyspan module or the usb-serial core.

I am not going to repeat the current arguments and it is not about
loading multiple firmware files (btw I wrote the bcm203x). Check the
mailing list archives for the details. I still need to catch up with the
discussion, but there is some ongoing work.

This is another approach and if you want something like that, then send
a patch for it and let Sam and others comment on it.
