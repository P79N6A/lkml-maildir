    iv) as Windows NT currently only uses the non-data forks for
	metadata, store the data fork in the page cache as normal, and
	read the metadata forks directly. This isn't entirely simple as
	a lot of the metadata structures can be bigger than a single
	block, but it should be do-able, right? I guess this is the
	least nasty option, but I'd like comments..
At the risk of spawning the whole to-file-fork-or-not-to-file-fork flame
war....  I agree, of the four choices, this is the one which I think
makes the most sense.
