No, I'm assuming that was due to the slab interaction.

Sounds good.

It would be interesting to hear as much as possible about this: if
Manfred's bio patch makes a difference, it's less intrusive than mine, and
as such interesting.
On the other hand, despite the small size of Manfred's patch, it does have
a big impact: since 128 bytes is a "watermark" for the slab debugging, the
patch which appears less intrusive does in fact still cause a big amount
of changes.
Anyway, the more you feel like testing, the better. But use your own
judgements.
Thanks a lot for the effort, btw,
