Fine with me, but it should IMHO be maintainer's call.
Things which a) are clearly better, and/or b) would require massive
reformatting when new maintainer steps in, should be documented
in CodingStyle and perhaps checked for by scripts and sparse.
Other things... sometimes there are multiple ways to do something
well, and humans aren't, and shouldn't be that deterministic.
