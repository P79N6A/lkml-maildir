inotify does indeed use file->private data to retrieve the inotify_dev
structure.  Of which by design exists a single instance only.  So yes,
you do not use the file descriptor at all.
This really looks like copied from the ioctl abuse 101 example code.
We are beating up driver writers for stupidities like that all the time,
and inotify is not going to get a special treatment just because it's
core code.

And a default limit matters exactly how?

Thanks a lot, I'm enjoying life a lot when I don't happen to have to deal
with ignorant people :)
