In the future it is likely that x86_64 will significantly deviate from 
i386. i386 is going to be gradually abandoned because it does not support 
the ever larger memory sizes and be mainly used for embedded devices. 
x86_64 is going to acquire more functionality that will not be available 
for i386. We plan f.e. to add virtual memmap support for x86_64. Virtual 
memmap support may require a large chunk of virtual memory space that is 
not available on i386. Its not good to have to deal with i386 issues when 
doing x86_64 arch development.
