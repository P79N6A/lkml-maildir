I just narrowed down a weird problem where I was losing more than 50% of 
my vblank interrupts to what seems to be the hires timers patch.  Stock 
2.6.23-rc5 works fine, but the latest (171) kernel from rawhide drops 
most of my interrupts unless I also have another interrupt source 
running (e.g. if I hold down a key or move the mouse I get the expected 
number of vblank interrupts, otherwise I get between 3 and 30 instead 
of the expected 60 per second).
Any ideas?  It seems like it might be bad APIC programming, but I 
haven't gone through those mods to look for suspects...
Thanks,
Jesse
