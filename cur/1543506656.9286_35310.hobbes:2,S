I disagree Sam.  If that is what it is meant to do, then something is
broken.  My modem is on IRQ3 (ppp tests as well).  There is NO other
device on that irq unless the new PnP routines have assigned some other
device that irq on boot, but from boot messages and /proc/interrupts, it
hasn't.  Also, now in 2.3.14 (first 2.3 I have tried), my serial ports
do NOT show up in /proc/interrupts!

Its trying to free an IRQ thats in conflict with another.  If IRQ3 only
shows 
up on PPP then it must be your modem.  Have you added any new devices
lately?
