DVB-CORE does not depend on I2C, since it does not rely on any I2C at
all. (DVB-CORE can use other methods) It is the PCI bridges that depend
on I2C. IIRC, we had a patch adding I2C dependencies for the Kconfig for
the relevant bridge chips. The frontends which are connected to the
bridges, depend on DVB-Core and I2C. So that dependency exists.
frontends foo
depends on DVB_CORE && I2C
pci bridges foo
depends on DVB_CORE && I2C && PCI
Maybe that patch has not made it yet to mainline.
