We used DPT RAID5 controllers and since 2 months we changed to Mylex eXtremeRAID
1100
controller.
Very good product with perfect drivers for Linux.
Major advantage is that you have 3 channels on, son you can start using a RAID5
subsystem on one channel, adding time after time more RAID5 subsystems and
sharing the I/O requests over the 3 channels.
