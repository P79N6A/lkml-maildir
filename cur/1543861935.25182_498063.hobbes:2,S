There are _tons_ of ideas to implement with kevent - so if we want, rate
will not slow down. As you can see, from take26 I only send new
features: signals, posix timers, AIO, userspace notifications, various
flags and the like. I test it on my machines (recently one them died, so
only amd64 right now (running kernel) and i386 compile-only)
and some bug-fixes withoout any additioanl feature requests (almost,
Ingo asked for AIO before New Year), but broader testing is welcome
indeed.

Exported git tree would be good, but I do not have enough disk space on
web-site, and do you really want to read comments written in bad english
with russian transliterated indecent words?

It was there, but Andrew dropped it somewhere about take25 :)
