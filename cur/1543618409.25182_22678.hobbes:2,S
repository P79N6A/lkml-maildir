(1)-scheduler/sched-O1-2.4.18-pre4-J4.patch
I was trying to test this in my 8 way NUMA box, but this patch
seems to have lost half of the wait_init_idle fix that I put
in a while back. I'm not sure if this is deliberate or not, but
I suspect not, as you only removed part of it, and from your 
comment below (from a previous email), I think you understand 
the reasoning behind it:

Anyway, the machine won't boot without this fix, so I tried adding
it back in, and now it boots just fine. Patch is attached below.
If the removal was accidental, please could you add it back in 
as below ... if not, could we discuss why this was removed, and
maybe we can find another way to fix the problem?
Meanwhile, I'll try to knock out some benchmark figures with the
new scheduler code in place on the 8 way NUMA and a 16 way
NUMA ;-)
Martin.
