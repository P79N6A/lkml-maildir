We use MAX_SECTORS (which is actually 127.5kB) because that's the 
max_sectors of the loopback device (we have a lot of users that like the 
flexibility of using loopback with the ibmvscsis driver)... It can be 
bumped up without any problems because there is code that splits 
requests if they are larger than the target's max_sectors...
What would you recommend? 256kB?
