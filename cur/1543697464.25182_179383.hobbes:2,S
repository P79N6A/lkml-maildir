Subject: [I810_AUDIO] 3/x: Remove bogus CIV_TO_LVI
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/11/22/4

This patch removes a pair of bogus LVI assignments.  The explanation in
the comment is wrong because the value of PCIB tells the hardware that
the DMA buffer can be processed even if LVI == CIV.
Setting LVI to CIV + 1 causes overruns when with short writes
(something that vmware is very fond of).
