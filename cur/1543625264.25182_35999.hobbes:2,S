Please let's extend BIOs and not break them up.

Unless I am mistaken this interacts very badly with the writing data
out to disk to free up memory, because you must allocate memory to
split the bio.  Which is the last place you want to allocate memory
if you can avoid it.
It's been a while but I believe there was a similiar thread about
splitting request to disk and the idea was shot down for similiar
reasons.
