I just installed kernel 2.6-beta 5 and I noticed my kde was kinda slow. I then 
saw that cpu was in 100% usage while doing nothing. I never reported any bug 
to the linux kernel before. What kind of info should I put in such a report 
and more importantly how do I get that info :). Should I post the bug here or 
in some bug database?
