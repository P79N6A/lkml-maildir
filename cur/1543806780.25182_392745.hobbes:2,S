Just trying to make sure we're all on the same page.

Gah. I'm an idiot. I wrote that last night as I was about to leave, then
just before going to bed I realized that it couldn't be a user-space
issue, since other kernel's work just fine. Put it down to
frustration :)

Yeah, I suspect so. I still have a nagging suspicion that something
about how memory has been setup is confusing ld.so while it tries to map
in the various sections of a dynamically linked executable. 
Hmmm, it just occurred to me that it might be while ld.so is mapping in
dependent libraries, not while mapping file sections. Think I'll go poke
at that a little.
