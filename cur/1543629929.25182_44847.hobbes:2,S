I'm all for less typing, but "consistent" memory has a definite meaning to 
some non-x86 architectures (and inconsistent also has a definite and 
semantically opposite meaning).
The x86 is nice because it is fully coherent architecture: the CPUs snoop the 
I/O busses and do CPU cache invalidations for data transferred from an I/O 
device directly to memory and CPU cache flushes when a device reads directly 
from memory.
If the CPU doesn't snoop I/O transfers, you have to manually invalidate or 
flush the necessary CPU cache lines.  The pci_sync_... functions are for doing 
the cache invalidations and flushes correctly.  Sometimes you can obtain a 
region of memory which is "consistent" meaning that  you no longer need to do 
the invalidations/flushes manually because the CPU will operate coherently on 
this region.  "inconsistent" means that you must control the CPU cache 
yourself.  In an incoherent memory architecture, the normal memory allocations 
give you "inconsistent" regions.
The royal pain on some CPUs is that they only have small consistent regions, 
so pci_alloc_consistent can fail and you have to know this and fall back to 
doing all the manual cache operations.  For this reason, some cross platform 
drivers simply choose not to bother with consistent memory at all because the 
cache manipulation operations are optimised away on fully consistent platforms.
I'd like to say that this is totally unrelated to the bus type, but some 
architectures place MMUs on their busses which means that memory consistency 
(and even memory addressability) can indeed be bus specific depending on what 
the MMU actually does.
