I think it's like the configure/Makefile.in situation. These files 
should technically not be in the repo either (and you removed them in 
your tree) but I re-added them because people have an expectation that:
./configure
make
will do something "out of the box". I just need to re-run 
autoconf/automake periodically to keep the files up to date. It's a 
pain, but I'll script that in due course alongside rebuilding the man 
pages - actually, this is probably just a convenient makefile target.
So if you want to redo the patch against those man pages, I'll 
regenerate them prior to pushing the next update. We'll leave it as it 
is until then because the update (IIRC) was just to re-order existing 
content so it's not like we have to push this with urgency.
Jon.
