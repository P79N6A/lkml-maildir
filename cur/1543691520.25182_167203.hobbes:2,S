While I'm certainly happy to hear that, I don't think I can take credit.
Nothing in the patch should help with system stability issues.
Do you have ACPI turned on?  Look at /proc/interrupts and see if any PCI
interrupts are set to edge triggered mode.  That's the #1 cause of stability
problems on nForce systems.
