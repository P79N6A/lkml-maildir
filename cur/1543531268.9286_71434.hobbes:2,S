Something like this should work:
ifconfig lo:1 192.168.10.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
route add -net 192.168.10.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev lo
BTW, we are running hundreds of web servers on one IP address instead
of hunderds of IP addresses. All modern (where modern means "after 1995")
browsers support this. Have been doing it for years. Check out the
NameVirtualHost option and "named virtual hosts" chapter in Apache.
