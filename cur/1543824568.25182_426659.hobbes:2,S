No not yet. These patches are part of the set we gathered in the queue after EDAC
was put into the kernel as a result of various other feedback.  The Non-Fatal noise
has been placed in the queue of work to do. Dave Peterson, who was co-maintainer of
EDAC, has moved on, so I have picking up the TODO slack and flushing these patches
out the door so I can start with a somewhat cleaner slate.
The good news is I have found a maintainer for the E7525 MC driver (I don't have
access to a mobo with that chipset, so I have a problem in verifying any mods I do
work) who has agreed to work with that driver. Thanks to mark gross for taking that
on. He and I have discussed this noise issue.
