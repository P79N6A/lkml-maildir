I don't think that will work, especially as it seems vserver's dont
nest.
I described an algo (on this list a day or 2 ago) that should work for
fixing the fd problem (everything else seems to be root's power related,
not chroot related)
we add a new field to the task_struct, which is some linked list of
chroot points, normally null for non chrooted processes.
when we call chroot, we dont just change the fs_struct, we pre-append
the same data as a linked list node to the beg of the list (i.e. the
element in the task struct)
in follow_dotdot() instead of checking against the fs_struct, we
basically say
	if (!current->chroot_points)
		; //we know we are not chrooted
	else
		for each element in chroot_list
			if current dir = chroot dir
				chroot = true;
				break
		
		if ( chroot )
			do whatever kernel does now
		else 
			do whatever kernel does now.
on fork, all you have to do is copy the list efficiently b/w parent and
child.
the reason this works, is that any fd you get has to be inside a chroot
point (or within the original root), therefore if you try to chroot
under a chroot while holding fd's, there will be a .. of one of those
fd's that will be a chroot point, that you can kill the path_walk at.
