... and that they have Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit or 8bit.
*Not* quoted-printable or base64.
Which means that you lose if the patch contains chars whose 8th bit is  
set, if any MTA between you and Linus/Alan/etc. doesn't like that. Which  
is not quite unlikely. (But most MUAs won't allow you to send something  
like that anyway.)
