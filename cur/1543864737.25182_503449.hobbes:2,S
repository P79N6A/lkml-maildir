Right, P-states are effective only when code is executing,
and on this processor (with C1E) will have no effect on idle power.

In 2.6.19 I believe that speedstep-centrino is the one to use.
The transition to acpi-cpufreq happens in 2.6.20.

Don't use speedstep-ich.

I believe that Conroe currently supports just C1 --
this is true for the ones I have.
Internally it is an "Enhanced C1" called C1E where the voltage is reduced
in C1-- but this is transparent to software, which thinks it is just C1.
You can observe this in
/proc/acpi/processor/*/power

C1-C3 have been supported for a long time.
2.6.20 adds a few tweaks to use a more efficient implementation,
but you'll not notice a difference on today's desktop processor.
