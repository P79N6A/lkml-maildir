Subject: broken device locking, sg vs. sg_io on block devices

Hello,
I am talking this issue to LKML now.
Short story: using O_EXCL on /dev/srX alone does not help to prevent
other process from killing your burn process by just reading the
/dev/sgX device associated with yours, and vice versa. We have done the
best we could to make safe operation (in contrary to Schilling's
kill-this-evil-hald-thing bitching) but that is not enough, the locking
has to be established on kernel layer.
Long story:

https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=226019
http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/debburn-devel/2007-February/000297.html
and other error messages.
There is AFAICS no simple way to establish locking across the driver
borders. If kernel developers have a good idea, any help is appreciated.
Below are the typical symptoms: wodim operates via /dev/sgX because the
user chosen it this way, some other process (most likely hald) comes
along and reads from /dev/sr0 and the drive gets confused. Boom.
Regards,
Eduard.
