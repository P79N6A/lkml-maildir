Ah, yes. I see what you mean now and I can confirm the same regression wrt
missing battery data in /proc for my laptop.
$ cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/*
cat: /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/alarm: Bad address
cat: /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/info: Bad address
cat: /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/state: Bad address
Sorry for the earlier misunderstanding.
