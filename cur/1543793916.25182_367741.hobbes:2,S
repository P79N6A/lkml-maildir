Not as far as I'm concerned.  He criticised the implementation,
which I generally agree with, but IMO the overall idea is not wrong.
BTW, you don't need to export the page flags, use /dev/kmem etc. to implement
it.  The only concern that I have wrt it is the writing of the image _after_ the
system has been snapshotted.
Greetings,
Rafael
