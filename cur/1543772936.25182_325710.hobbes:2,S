The -rc6 aic7 driver needs just over 7 minutes to recover from this tape
unit. In -rc3 this was 80 seconds. -rc2 had no problem.
I don't really need this old tape unit and I don't [re-]boot that often
so it is not a problem for me. Anyway, if something needs to be tested
then mail me a patch (for stock rc6) and I'll try it.
