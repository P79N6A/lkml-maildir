One or other is, certainly.  My suspicion is that perhaps both are at fault.
You don't say what kernel you're using.  If you're using a 2.0 kernel you 
should consider changing to 2.2 as the EtherExpress driver is newer.  Also, if 
you are running the card in 8-bit mode, consider changing to 16-bit mode (use 
SOFTSET).
