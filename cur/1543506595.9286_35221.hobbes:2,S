Turns out it wasn't a kernel problem. I had the io port and irq set wrong
in conf.modules, and parport peacefully accepted the given options and
sent data to the bit bucket.
Question: is this proper behavior? It caused a system freeze on 2.3.13 and
failed silently on 2.3.15-pre2. Is there any way for the parport module to
say "you stupid (l)user, there isn't a parallel port there!"?
