Now, to be fair, there are probably a number of cases where 
open/lseek/readv/close and open/lseek/writev/close would be worth doing 
as a single system call.  The big problem as far as I can see involves 
EINTR handling; such a system call has serious restartability implications.
Of course, there are Ingo's syslets...
