Thanks for the review, Randy.  Good comments.

Yup - I should have written this line as:

It makes no difference to the code generated.  I tend to leave
out 'compiler optimization' hint words if I don't need them to
get the compiler to optimize.  In this case, of a single use
file static routine, the compiler inlines anyway.

You're right - and Andrew would be right as well, since the form:
	q = csa = doms = NULL;
generates a compiler warning, as not all three pointers are the
same type.
So three lines of code it must be.

Yup - you're right - about the 'csa' check.
However the if(q ...) check is needed, because I have another bug
here.  I allocated 'q' using kfifo_alloc(), so must free using
kfifo_free (or else leak the kfifo buffer memory.)  Calls to
kfifo_free() have to guard against NULL pointers before the call.
Thanks, Randy!
