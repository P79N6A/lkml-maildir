Yup, I like 'em for that reason as well.  And you can do a
	bk clean # removes all non-modified working files
	ls	 # should see nothing but SCCS/
to clean up all that extra cruft that invariably winds up in your tree.

Please see the response to Ingo and see if you could do what I suggested
there.  I believe that would work fine, if not, let me know.

In the next release, there is a "bk fix -c" that does what you want.  It
reedits the entire changeset, and preserves all your checkin comments. 
You don't want to use this if the changeset has propogated out of your
tree, but I use it all the time for exactly the situation you describe
above.  It will be in bk-2.1.4.

Yeah, we know.  Read the other mails and tell me if you think that the 
false dependency remove largely fixes this, somewhat fixes it, or doesn't
help.

This one is unlikely to happen, it is a much harder problem technically than
it appears on the surface.

In other words, "proxy" == "place holder".  This is doable but it makes
synchronizing repositories quite a bit more complex.  I.e., if I pull
from you and I have place holders and you have the real thing, should
I get 'em or not?  If the answer is always "or not", then this is a 
doable thing.  We'd need to modify the "bk takepatch" code path to do
the right thing when given the real patch but that's doable as well.
Interesting idea, we could do this and it would be relatively fast to
do, like a week or two.

We wouldn't lose it, we'd have to add some extra state to say it is in there
but only as a placeholder, so keep bugging Linus.
