For the most part, disk IO speed is irrelevant to system performance on a Linux
box used for normal desktop activities.  The drive hardly ever needs to spin because
of the effective cache management.  The only time I notice disk performance is when
'fsck' runs.  Since don't reboot my machine that often, it will be a while before I
know if 'fsck' is running any faster.

Yeah.  I'm addicted to 'menuconfig'.  Usually when I use 'make config', I'll start hitting
return repeatedly for the options I don't want to change and accidentally pass the options
I do want to change.  I've tried 'make xconfig', but I really don't care for the X11 
inter phase, and it is impossible to use if I'm trying to do something like get the 
mouse properly configured.

Cool.  My main worry was Linux was going to diverge from supporting my hardware.
Right now more of my hardware works under Linux than Windows.  That is a dramatic
change from when I first started using Linux back in 1992 or was it 1993 when I
was ecstatic to be able to print ASCII text.
