 check the CRC count on the first drive, hda. Its
 65584 !!! Thats huge. This
 CRC values result in UDMA downgrades. Also, check
 the reallocation sector
 count. A high value here means possible timeouts.
 With high reallocation
 sector count, there could be multiple mappings a
 drive would have to look
 into to get to the proper sector. You should change
 the drive hda and also
 the cable. Then try again. 
 Thanks
 Manish
