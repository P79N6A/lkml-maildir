  I'm not very much experienced in this area so please forgive me if I'm
wrong but AFAIK there are capabilities in linux which should allow
programs to do some privileged actions even if they are non-root ones. So
there should be no need for most programs to be SUID and so this feature
wouldn't be much useful...
