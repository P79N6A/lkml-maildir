they may be using it on that list, but there's very little of that in
the kernel source itself.  this is the only example i found:
$ grep -r '<[0-7]>' * | grep printk
arch/ppc/syslib/m8260_pci_erratum9.c:   printk("<4>Using IDMA%d for MPC8260 device erratum PCI 9 workaround\n",
maybe i'll submit a patch to clean that one up.
