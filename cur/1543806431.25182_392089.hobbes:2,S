It's still not clear what's supposed to be happening here.
In build_sched_domains() we still have code which does:
	for_each_cpu_mask(...) {
		...
#ifdef CONFIG_SCHED_MC
		...
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_SCHED_SMT
		...
#endif
		...
	}
	...
#ifdef CONFIG_SCHED_SMT
	...
#endif
	...
#ifdef CONFIG_SCHED_MC
	...
#endif
So in the first case the SCHED_SMT code will win and in the second case the
SCHED_MC code will win.  I think.  The code is so repetitive in there that
`patch' may have put the hunks in the wrong place.
What is the design intention here?  What do we _want_ to happen if both MC
and SMT are enabled?
Also the path tests CONFIG_SCHED_MT in a few places where it meant to use
CONFIG_SCHED_SMT, which rather casts doubt upon the testing quality.
