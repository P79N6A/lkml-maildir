Hmm, when I personally got this message this morning I thought that it
was an error in the address book of this "Steve". Now I also see
*exactly* the same message back on linux-kernel I think it is a cunning
plan to harvest email adresses. Might be a good plan to put the
following regexp in the majordomo taboo_headers:
  /^Subject: Thanks For Lunch Mike/i
