Hello... Just a quick question...
Does anyone know why there ins't a G400 option in the DRI kernel stuff?  I
wasn't able to successfully to get a G400 DRI module out of the X source
after several hours of recompiling and I can't understand why the G400
kernel module isn't in the official kernel tree when the 3dfx module, etc
already is.  Is it right to expect a user to have a copy of the X source
laying around to get DRI kernel modules?  or perhaps I'm misunderstanding
their purpose?
Thanks for your time...
