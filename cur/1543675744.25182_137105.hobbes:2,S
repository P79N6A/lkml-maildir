That makes no sense.
Do you write your normal variable definitions like
	int
	a,b,c;
too? No you don't, because that would be totally idiotic.
A function declaration is no different. The type of the function is very
important to the function itself (along with the arguments), and I
personally want to see _all_ of it when I grep for functions. 
You should just do
	grep -i '^[a-z_ ]*(' *.c 
and you'll get a nice function declaration with the standard kernel
coding style.
And I personally don't normally do "grep for random function
declarations", that just sounds like a contrieved example.  I grep for
specific function names to find usage, and then it's _doubly_ important
to see that the return (and argument) types match and make sense.
So I definitely prefer all the arguments on the same line too, even if
that makes the line be closer to 100 chars than 80.  The zlib K&R->ANSI
conversion was a special case, and I'd be happy if somebody were to have
the energy to convert it all the way (which implies moving comments
around etc).
