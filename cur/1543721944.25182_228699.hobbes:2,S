The pattern formed a long time ago... there are several web pages dedicated
to the failure that is SATA. (1.5GHz signal on an unshielded cable?  WTF
were they thinking?)

Not all drives and not all ways Seagate.  The seagate drive that fails
most often (always?) is FW 3.05 while the other 3 are FW 3.18.

The 3ware card has 250G Maxtor drives.  The drive that fails has different
firmware than the other three.  It fails irrespective of which port it's
on.  And powermax diag fails recalibration 50% of the time.
(FW YAR51EW0 works -- 3 on the 3ware, and 2 in Dells, YAR51BW0 fails.)

Actually, I think it's the controller that's borked.  There's no way to
"hardware reset" a SATA drive without powering down the system which I'm
not doing.  And the same problems do not happen in windows using si's
driver.  Accorinding to FreeBSD developers, si's hardware is, point blank,
broken.

Any sustained burst write will eventually lock up the channel.  It can take
seconds or hours.  It is as if a packet is being dropped during the DMA
transfer or the DMA completing without an ack.
