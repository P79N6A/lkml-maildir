Two things Im not 100% sure is correct
1. This may be wonderous hand optimised magic but I'd rather let the compiler
   do it so its readable. Also have you checked what apps will try to set
   unused flags and assume they will fail quietly ?
+/*
+ * Disallow unknown clone(2) flags, as well as CLONE_PID, unless we are
+ * the boot up thread.
+ *
+ * Avoid taking any branches in the common case.
+ */
+       if (clone_flags &
+           (-(signed long)current->pid >> (sizeof(long) * 8 - 1)) &
+           ~(unsigned long)(CSIGNAL |
+           CLONE_VM | CLONE_FS | CLONE_FILES | CLONE_SIGHAND))
+		        goto bad_fork;
+
2. This bit
+       if (sk->state == TCP_SYN_RECV) {
+   	        /*
+                * Should be the exact sequence number for the handshake
+                * to succeed, or sequence prediction gets a bit easier.
+                * Also, "partially-established" connections are bad for
+                * the rest of our code.
+                */
+               if (ack != sk->sent_seq) goto uninteresting_ack;
+       } else
        if (after(ack, sk->sent_seq) || before(ack, sk->rcv_ack_seq))
                goto uninteresting_ack;
